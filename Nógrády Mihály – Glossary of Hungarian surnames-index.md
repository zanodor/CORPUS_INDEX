Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
INTRODUCTORY
Names, whether they denote places or identify people, are derived from the language of the community which bestowed them. Some names, because of their antiquity, do not have a meaning in the spoken language and their understanding presents a problem. This is especially true for immigrant groups and their descendants in Canada whose surnames originated in a language other than English or French. Such group is the Hungarians who call themselves Magyar in their own language. Most people of Hungarian descent accept their surnames as a requisite for meeting the requirements of society and being able to function properly in their daily lives. They do not think it may mean something in the language of their ancestors. Like a Mr. Dave Santa whose last name is mistakenly associated with the Yuletide season's Santa Claus. He was quoted in a newspaper article as saying "I always got bugged as a kid. They would say, 'What are you bringing me for Christmas?' that sort of things [...] It's a Hungarian name, as far as I know. It was shortened. But I don't know what it was originally. Overall it's good. It's my name" (McKeen 1996: C9). The name Santa, spelled Sánta in its original Hungarian form, is indeed a good name but neither has anything to do with the Yuletide season and Santa Claus, nor was it shortened. It belongs to a group of Hungarian surnames that depict defects and blemishes. Sánta, pronounced as Shawn-tah, signifies a 'lame' or 'limping' person. Other names that belong in this category are Csonka 'mutilated', Görbe 'crooked', or 'hunched', Sebes 'covered with sores or having scars'. These words are easy to find in a dictionary, but other Hungarian surnames like Gál, Ilku, Aba or Buda present problems for those not initiated in ancient languages. Names, whether their meanings are known or not, may be used in genealogical research, but are misleading in tracing one's ancestry. A name can only reveal the language from which it was derived, not the racial or genetic background of the predecessors. This is especially true in patriarchal societies where only the father's surname is carried on. The name may point in one direction but the genetic make-up in another. Consequently the name is not a decisive factor in the search for one's ancestry, only a guide. But chances are that if a person's ancestors never left Hungary and they had names that originated in the Hungarian language, then he or she is of Hungarian descent. Some names turn symbolic as soon as the word from which they are derived becomes disused in the spoken language. A name which has no meaning in the current language may baffle most of us, but only few would make an attempt to find its signification, others would put it down as a name. But name researchers have a different approach. They maintain that every name had a coherent meaning at the time of its bestowal and it is worth spending time to unravel their secrets, which in our case is hidden in Hungarian and its cognate languages. A skillful evaluation of names, especially of surnames, may shed light on obscure periods of history. Names can reveal vocational diversification, feudal social order, naming habits and ways of life. Names in early Hungarian society were neither created by rash decisions, nor were they the result of careful contemplation. Their bestowal were not organized or

regulated by a given formula. They were the product of the community that created many other useful customs to serve as guidelines in the daily discourse of its members. Names were derived from the spoken language, necessitated by the need to differentiate between individuals. Every conversation requires the identification or description of people as well as objects. These descriptions were simplified and reduced to a befitting single name. Name giving was spontaneous in most cases and it may have happened that the same person was called by a different name in the next village. Both names, however, described the person accurately. In his own village he may have been called by his occupation, while in another he was referred to by the name of his birth place. Since the way of thinking is the same among people speaking the same language, the choice of names was uniform in regions far apart from one another. The name giving custom of Hungarians in Transylvania was identical to those living in the Csallóköz (confined to Slovakia, now called Žitný ostrov in Slovakia). The most fitting name eventually became permanent by its regular use and accompanied its owner throughout his/her life. In some cases, when the name was unique, the children inherited it but the derivational suffix -i was added to indicate a descendant. The transfer of the father's name to his descendants became obligatory only after the compulsory registration of names which was usually done at the time the child was baptized. The compulsory use of surnames in front of baptismal names was introduced at the end of the 18th century (Kálmán 1978: 62). The freedom in choosing and changing one's surname has ended at that time. However, the custom of free choice in name giving continues in the form of nicknames to the present day. Nicknames fulfill the same self-satisfying freedom in choice as they did in antiquity. The ancestors of Hungarians did not know that a large number of their names will survive for posterity. Therefore, we should not be surprised about the revealing nature of some names, because the words from which they originated were part of casual conversations, lacking awareness for future potential embarrassment. The single name system was prevalent among the serfs during the Middle Ages. Non-Christian names like Modor, Ziget, Joulegen, Mocus, Suprun, Topa and Bot were recorded according to the yet unregulated spelling system of the period. Their presentday equivalents are Modor, Sziget, Jólegény, Mókus, Sopron, Topa and Bot. Old documents suggest that one person had only one name in Hungary until around the 13th century when the use of Christian names, derived from the Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages, have begun to supplant the old and established Hungarian names. The need for avoiding ambiguity between persons having the same name gave an impetus for the use of what we now call surnames. In the 13th century, some names are already listed with attributes in Latin, the language of administration. Such names are Pousa banus ‘Pósa the warden’, Pousa filius Zombot ‘Pósa son of Saturday’, Pristaldo Pousa ‘Bailiff Pósa’, Pousa Vendegus ‘Pósa the guest’ (Fehértói 1983: 282-286). The old names did not disappear but first continued to be used side by side with baptismal names and then gradually as attributes in front of Christian names, thus the Hungarian system of last name first emerged. From the 13th century on, the surname system slowly acquired popularity as baptismal names gained acceptance and the naming practice was on its way to

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
stabilization. The former single name that was derived from the spoken language assumed the role of a surname in the form of adjective. For example, János the son of Sziget became Szigeti János ‘John Szigeti’ by the addition of the derivational suffix -i to the former single name of the father. The derivational or relational suffix -i (archaic -y) was mostly used for denoting geographical origin though. Like, a person from the city of Buda was named Budai.
Another way to indicate descent was to append -fi (archaic -fy) to the father’s name. The element -fi is derived from fiú ‘son’. For example Keményfi means ‘son of Kemény’. But this kind of name formation was rare, only few surnames survived from that era. Girls also inherited their surnames from the paternal line which they kept until marriage. After marriage, women adopted their husband’s surname. They were still addressed by their baptismal name in everyday life, but were recorded in the registry as their husband’s wife by addition of the suffix -né. For example, the wife of Szabó János was registered as Szabó Jánosné. The adaptation of surnames was first practiced by the nobility and the wealthy segment of society. The general public, mostly serfs, was slow to catch up. Surnames, in general, became fashionable by the 16th century but were not inherited by the descendants as a rule. If a Kovács János ‘John Smith’ had a son who became a tailor then he was referred to as Szabó János ‘John Tailor’. Until it was banished by kings of the House of Árpád (896-1301), the Magyars used a rune-like writing system called rovásírás. It was developed to meet the phonetic needs of their language, unlike the Roman alphabet which replaced it after conversion to Christianity around the beginning of the second millennium AD. The Roman alphabet had an unfavorable effect for it has fewer letter than the number of speech sounds in the Magyar language. Scribes had to grapple with the problem of finding appropriate ways for recording the extra sounds by combining the available Roman graphemes. They did this individually, disparate of each other, which resulted in various spellings of old names. Such names are listed for each entry when available. The archetype rovásírás was a consonantal syllabary in character, each sign representing a consonant and an unidentified vowel. The choice of vowel was left up to the reader. The lack of written vowels presented little difficulty owing to the nature of the language. The favoring of consonants provided a much needed flexibility for the Magyars to accommodate the various vowels in different dialects of their language. Later, however, a separate sign was developed for each vowel thus the last version of the alphabet had one letter for each speech sound
KEY TO PRONUNCIATION
Hungarian names and words are printed in Italic, followed by their proper pronunciation in square brackets depicted by the Phonetic Transcription. The stress is always on the first syllable. Occasionally it shifts to a consonant away from the first syllable. When this happens, the stressed consonant is marked by reduplication. The length of consonants is uniform in all cases. The length of vowels without diacritical marks is always short. Some vowel lengths are modified by diacritical marks,

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
placed above the letters. Short vowels are marked with dieresis (  ̈ ), which also indicates a change in vowel quality, as in o>ö, or u>ü. Long vowels are marked with the acute accent (  ́ ) as á, é, í, ó; or the double acute accent ( ʺ ) as in ő, ű. Diacritical marks play an important role not only in pronunciation but in meaning too. For example veréb [vere:b] means ‘sparrow’, but if the acute accent is placed above the first vowel it produces véreb [ve:reb] ‘blood hound’. Also, the meaning of úr [u:r] ‘lord’ changes to ‘space’ when the acute accent is replaced by a double acute accent to read űr [y:r]. It should be noted that the combination of two letters, the cs, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty and zs mark a single consonant in Hungarian orthography. The Phonetic Transcription for these consonants will be underlined in this publication. A firm parity exists between the spoken language and its written form. Each Hungarian letter, or combination of two letters, has its distinct sound which remains constant. There is no omission of sounds, every letter has to be pronounced in every word or name without exception. For this reason Hungarian is one of the few languages that have a truly phonetic spelling system. The following table shows all Hungarian letters, their corresponding Phonetic Transcription and samples of how they compare to English sounds.

MOST FREQUENT SUFFIXES IN SURNAMES
-a [a] This suffix may become -e [e] or -ú [u:] as required by vowel harmony. It is an archaic suffix that formed adjectives from nouns and verbs. Believed to be the continuation of the Sumerian adjectival suffix -a described by Marie-Louise Thomsen (1984: 64). The suffix -a once played a considerable role in the formation of adjectives as evidenced by old names and words but it is no longer in active use by Hungarians. It is decidedly safe to conclude that this Sumerian suffix was active in the early Hungarian language, but later it was supplanted by the current -s [sh] when the adjective is formed from a noun and by the participle -ó [o:] when formed from a verb. The change from -a to -s and -ó is most evident in surnames as demonstrated by the following examples: Barta - Bartos - Bartó Csoma - Csomós - Csomó Doba - Dobos - Dobó Síma - Símás - Simó Varga - Vargus - Vargó
-ány [a:nj] May assume the forms -ény, -ony, -uny as required by vowel harmony. It is a nominal suffix that converts verbs and nouns into collective nouns. Examples: hoz 'bring' > hozomány 'dowry'; vet 'sow' > vetemény 'vegetable'.
-ár [a:r] Other forms are -ér [e:r], -or [or] as required by vowel harmony. It is a nominal suffix that forms occupations or action nouns from verbs and nouns. Examples: csap 'faucet; spigot' > csaplár 'bartender; inn-keeper'; tüz 'fire' > tüzér 'artilleryman'; kaland 'adventure' > kalandor 'adventurer'. This is an internationally shared suffix present in the Uralic, Altaic and the Indó

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
European languages mostly in the form of -er. It denotes occupations in all of them. Cf. write > writer.
-as [ash] The permanent feature of this suffix is the letter s [sh], which may be preceded by a connecting vowel that conforms to the rules of vowel harmony (-ás [a:sh], -es [esh], -os [osh], -ös [øsh], -us [ush], -üs [ysh]). This suffix forms adjectives from nouns to denote: 1. Occupations; kosaras 'basket maker or seller', from kosár 'basket'. 2. Involvement; játékos 'player', from játék 'play, game'. 3. Character and quality; rendes 'orderly, correct', from rend 'order'. 4. Condition; sáros 'muddy', from sár 'mud'. 5. Resemblance; kékes 'bluish', from kék 'blue'. 6. Status and rank; gyáros 'industrialist', from gyár 'factory'; százados 'captain', from század 'company of one hundred soldiers', derived from száz 'hundred'. 7. Possession and provision; csizmás 'one who owns and wears a pair of highboots', from csizma 'high-boot'; fegyveres 'one who has been provided with weapons (armed)', from fegyver 'weapon'. It may be of interest to note that the Persian suffix -esh (pronounced the same as the Hungarian -es) forms nouns of quality or activity. Cf. Persian âmûzesh 'knowledge', Hungarian tudás; Persian namayesh 'exhibition', Hungarian kiállítás (Mace 1971:197). The exact likeness of the Hungarian -es was also present in the Sumerian language in the form of -eš according to Marie-Louise Thomsen. One of the examples given is the Sumerian da-re-eš ‘for ever’ (Thomsen 1984: 66), cf. Hungarian örökös ‘perpetual’. The word-final element in both words are the same [sh] preceded by a vowel.
-ász [a:s] Also spelled -ész [e:s] when required by vowel harmony. This is a formative suffix which converts nouns and in some rare cases verbs into names of specialized occupations or professions. It functions much the same as the English suffixes -ist, -er and -ician. Examples: gépész 'machinist', from gép 'machine'; halász 'fisher', from hal 'fish'; szülész 'obstetrician', from szül 'give birth'.
-at [at] Also spelled -át [a:t], -et [et] and -ét [e:t] when affected by vowel harmony. This suffix converts verbs and nouns to "derived nouns". It may be called a nominal suffix with caution when appended to verbs: húz 'draw' > huzat 'draught'; kel 'rise' > kelet 'east'. But, to my knowledge, there is no generally accepted appropriate English term when suffixed to a noun: müvész 'artist' > müvészet 'art'; mag 'seed' > magzat 'embryo, offspring'.
-da [da] The suffix -da is present in many Hungarian surnames that are derived from old place names. It appears to be a grammatical designator denoting a place, but the complexity of its multiple functions has never been explored. The suffix -da used to be active in the formation of place names during the



7
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Middle Ages in Hungary, which is an indication that its use must have been extensive in the spoken language. Its usage, however, was allowed to diminish until it was revived in the early 19th century for a short period of time, only to fall out of use again. During its short lived renewed activity one distinct characteristic of -da was the formation of nouns from verbs. The resultant noun denoted a place which people either inhabited or used for a specific activity. Examples: fog ‘hold’ > fogda ‘prison’; nyom ‘press’ > nyomda ‘printing shop’; zár ‘lock, close’ > zárda ‘convent’. While -da was the most frequently used suffix in the formation of place names, occasionally a single -d or a transposed -ad, or -ta was used for the same purpose. The phoneme d and t are regarded transposable. Examples: Várda; Várad; Érd; Zajta. The suffix -da is present in languages other than Hungarian. In the Turkish language, it is a particle forming the locative case (Akdikmen 1986: 90). It is also an Estonian suffix that indicates a place. The Sumerians used it too in ancient Mesopotamia. The Sumerian suffix -da appears to be more complex than its modern equivalents. Labat inform us that both da and ta denote a district or neighborhood as independent words (Labat 1948: No. 335). The present-day Hungarian equivalent of the Sumerian ta would be táj [ta:j] ‘region, neighborhood’. According to Deimel, the Sumerian -da was also used as an adverbial suffix of place (Deimel 1939: 196). This function may be exemplified by the Hungarian oda ‘to there’ derived from ott ‘there’ and ide ‘to here’ derived from itt ‘here’. Both René Labat and Anton Deimel disclose that da and ta have an additional meaning ‘side’ as independent words. The word ta is still being used in this sense in Hungary. When a stableman wants a horse to move its rump to one side, he says far ta ‘rump to the side’.
-fi [fi] Also spelled -ffi [fi], -fy [fi] and -ffy [fi] 'son of'. Derived from the word fiú 'son', it is a patronymic suffix, attached to the father’s surname. This kind of naming is similar to the English patronymics, like Emerson ‘son of Emery’. Hungarian examples: Gálfi 'son of Gál'; Bátorffi 'son of Bátor'; Pálfy 'son of Pál'; Bánffy 'son of Bán'.
-i [i] Generally referred to as a derivational suffix, but its more proper description would be relational suffix (viszonyrag in Hungarian). Also spelled -y but pronounced [i] in surnames of medieval origin when some scribes substituted the Greek y for the Roman i. In rare cases the suffix -i is rendered -e, as a result of wrongly applied vowel harmony (Abele instead of Abeli), and when that happens it is interpreted by a number of linguists as being the possessive suffix -é [e:]. Hungarian scholarly views differ about the function of this suffix. Some identify it as a form of patronymic turned possessive (Kálmán 1978: 65). Others classify it as an adjectival suffix pertaining to place and time (Bánhidi et al. 1965: 219), when in fact its function includes both and even more. It is used with reference to geographical names to indicate where a person resides or comes from and in surnames to indicate parental origin. The -i or -y are suffixed to nouns to form:

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
1. Patronymics, when the paternal name precedes the suffix - Mihályi 'Mihály's, descendant of Mihály'. Cf. Sumerian I7 ‘descendant’, I9 ‘origin’ (Labat 1948: No. 381, 579). 2. Adjectives, pertaining to place and time, e.g. gyári munkás 'factory worker'. The phrase reggeli műszak 'morning shift' designates the time of work. 3. Place of origin, e.g. Aradi 'a native of Arad'. The surname denotes the residence or the place where the person or his ancestors came from. 4. Endearments. For example the endearing form of pajtás 'chum, mate' is pajti.
The derivational suffix -i is also present in languages other than Hungarian. It is shared by European and Oriental languages such as Spanish, Iranian (Persian) and Semitic. A Persian example would be shah 'king' > shahi 'royal', of which the Hungarian equivalent is király 'king' > királyi 'royal'. The ultimate source of this suffix may be the Sumerian language where it also added adjectival value to a noun: Uri 'a resident of Ur'. Ur was the name of a city where Sumerian civilization reached its peak as early as 3500 BC. Interestingly, Hungarians still call a refined urbanite úri ember 'a man from Ur'. Úr also denotes a 'gentleman' and a 'lord' in their language.
-ik [ik] Also spelled -ic [ik] in old names. This suffix is shared by the agglutinative (Sumerian, Uralic and Altaic) and the inflective (Indo-European) languages where it forms adjectives from nouns in addition to expressing relationship. In the words of Francois Lenormant, the Akkadian -ik was employed in forming the names of agents and adjectives with an active signification, as in nirik 'prince' from nir to govern', uddaik 'preeminent' from uddu 'to rise' (Lenormant 1877: 392). There was no differentiation between the Sumerian and Akkadian languages at the time of Lenormant.
-ka [ka] Endearing suffix. It may originate from the independent Sumerian word ku (Labat 1948: No. 468) which assumed the form -ka or -ke after becoming a suffix in the Hungarian language. The meaning of the Sumerian ku is 'innocent, gracious, friendly', when attached to a name as a Hungarian suffix, it indicates that the person has those qualities. The suffix -ka at the end of place names may be the Hungarian variant of the Sumerian ki 'place, land, country, region' (Labat 1948: No. 460). For example the wordfinal element -ka in Szabadka, a Hungarian toponym (confined to Serbia in 1020, now called Subotica) may mean 'place'. Szabad means 'free' in the Hungarian language, thus 'free place'. A fair amount of caution should be exercised in the semantic role of -ka. It is used as a diminutive suffix in the Slavonic languages and Hungarians living in Slavic speech communities tend to use it in that sense. Also, Hungary was in the Slavic sphere of influence from 1945 to 1991 and during that time some linguists promulgated that the Hungarian -ka fulfills the same diminutive function as the Slavonic -ka. But it does not.



9
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
The Hungarian diminutive is the prefix kis- as in kislány 'little girl'. The adjective kis means 'small, little' as an independent word. Kislányka translates as 'darling little girl'.
-nok [nok] A suffix that forms occupations and earned or awarded status from nouns and verbs. Examples: tár 'store' > tárnok 'storekeeper'; fő 'head' > főnök 'supervisor'; baj 'challenge, distress' > bajnok 'champion'. There is a possibility that this suffix is the continuation of the Sumerian formative nig (Labat 1948: No. 597), frequently used in the forming of nouns with both physical and non-physical attributes. Example: nig-gig 'evil, harm' from gig 'darkness, black' (Labat 1948: 427).
-ó [o:] Participle suffix, forms adjectives from verbs. It may take the form -ő or another appropriate vowel as a result of vowel harmony. Adjectives derived from verbs usually denote occupations. The suffix is used in this capacity in most surnames. Examples: csap 'hit, strike' > Csapó 'fuller, beater'; jár 'walk' > Járó 'walker'.
VOWEL HARMONY
The principle of phonetic agreement between the initial and subsequent vowels in a word is referred to as vowel harmony. The vowels in most agglutinative languages, like Turkish and Hungarian, must either be all frontal (e.g. e, ö, ő, ü, ű) or all back (e.g. a, á, o, ó, u, ú). Loan words from foreign languages, compound words and intermediate vowels (e.g. é, i, í) are the only exceptions, they do not require harmonization but all others do. The rules of vowel harmony require that suffixes attached to the root word must all contain either front or back vowels, not a combination of both. If the vowel of the root word happens to be a back vowel, like in the case of Hun, then the vowel of the suffix must be of the same class: -gar.

Summary
Hungarian immigrants to Canada are faced with linguistic decisions concerning their given and family names due to the phonetic and orthographic differences between the English and the Hungarian languages. The changes made are usually minor, so that the written name looks similar to its original form. Changes include the removal of

diacritical marks, the replacement of unfamiliar letter combinations and adoption of English given names.
Introduction
Most Hungarian immigrants arrive in Canada knowing about the country’s two official languages, but not fully understanding the effects the English or French languages will impose on their names. They are seldom aware of the changes that will have to be made, due to the different naming practices and the different use of the Roman alphabet in the Hungarian language. These two elements account for changes made to their names immediately after entering the country and for other modifications made thereafter. Hungarians entering Canada could potentially be affected by both English and French influences. Both of these languages use the Roman alphabet for writing, the same as Hungarian, but the sound-letter relationship varies between them and the Hungarian language. Thus, to simplify the discussion, this paper will focus on the treatment of Hungarian names in the English speaking environment in Canada.
Hungarian names without diacritical marks
Hungarian names which have no diacritical marks can continue functioning in their original forms, much to the satisfaction of their bearers. These names are comprised of letters that look familiar to speakers of the English language. The sequence of letters may not be familiar in some cases and may present problems for pronunciation, mainly due to differences in articulation. Such surnames are Gazdag [gazdag] ‘rich’, Baka [baka] ‘infantryman’, Jeles [jelesh], ‘eminent’, Torma [torma] ‘horseradish’ or Csala [chala] ‘enticer’. As for Csala, English speakers will likely say [sele] while a Hungarian will say [chala].
Hungarian names with diacritical marks
Names without diacritical marks comprise only a small number of all Hungarian names recorded in Canada. Most of them do have diacritical marks and Hungarians having such names retain the original letters without showing them. The omission of diacritical marks results in new orthographic forms. Some of these new forms can also have new meanings in the Hungarian language. For example, when Csörgő [chørgø:] becomes Csorgo [chorgo:], the meaning changes from ‘rattling’ to ‘trickling’; similarly Körmös [kørmøsh] ‘clawed’ becomes Kormos [kormosh] ‘sooty’. Or, when Gömbös [gømbøsh] becomes Gombos [gombosh], a change in meaning takes place from ‘spherical’ to ‘one whom has buttons’. These changes, especially when they result in genuine Hungarian names, become misleading for the present and subsequent generations of name researchers in Canada. A name researcher would have no reason to further investigate the etymology of Gombos, because it is indeed a name, and would not suspect that it may be the mutilated form of Gömbös. Some names appear to be unrelated to the Hungarian language after their loss of diacritical marks. For example, Láng [la:ng] ‘flame’ becomes Lang, [lang] which means ‘long’ in German.

Hungarian given names with recognizable equivalents
The loss of diacritical marks is only one of the mutations a Hungarian name may suffer. Given names present additional problems, mainly in pronunciation, and many immigrants prefer to abandon them in favor of their English equivalents. To find the English equivalent for a Hungarian Christian name is comparatively less difficult than for those names of uniquely Hungarian origin. The spelling of Christian names does not vary too much from one language to another and adopting the English version does not present problems. Examples:
Hungarian Hungarian English spelling pronunciation equivalent
József [jo:zhef] Joseph Dávid [da:vid] David Mária [ma:ria] Mary, Marie Erzsébet [erzhe:bet] Elizabeth Teréz [tere:z] Theresa, Teresa Ábrahám [a:braha:m] Abraham Mihály [miha:j] Michael
Most Hungarians having Christian forenames have converted them to their English equivalents in order to expedite the transition to English Canadian society, both for social acceptance and increased chances for success in the search for economic opportunities.
Hungarian given names without comparable equivalents
The problem is different with given names derived from the Hungarian language which have no English equivalents. It is even difficult to coin adequate English versions which would approximate the original orthography and pronunciation. Names like Boglár [bogla:r] ‘rosette’, Bulcsú [bulchu:] ‘sage’, Hajnal [hajnal] ‘dawn’ and Gyöngy [djøndj] ‘pearl’ are usually retained intact for official use, but in everyday life Béla may prefer to be called Bill and Gyöngy may function as Georgia. However, in the majority of cases, their colleagues, friends and close acquaintances learn the proper Hungarian pronunciation and use it successfully. Since the Hungarian custom is to have only one first name, one solution for those with difficult Hungarian given names would be to choose and officially adopt an English second name and retain the original first name. But two or more given names are rare among first generation immigrant Hungarians and they would not feel comfortable having two given names; therefore, this practice is seldom followed.
Given names of second generation Hungarians
The naming of second generation Hungarians follows the Canadian custom, but given names are carefully selected. One of the names is either Hungarian, or the orthographic difference between the English and Hungarian version is so small that



12
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Hungarian speaking relatives have no difficulties in identifying them. For example Robert - Róbert, Albert - Albert, Abel - Ábel, Lauren - Laura, Nellie - Nelli. There was no research done on the naming habits of subsequent generations, although one can suspect that the process of acculturation would have diluted any desire to reflect Hungarian forenames in the naming of children.
Adaptation of Hungarian surnames
Surname problems are of a different nature. While given names can be modified or adapted without many difficulties, a surname has legal status and cannot be changed arbitrarily, unless it is legally changed - a move few Hungarians are willing to undertake. Surnames derived from the Hungarian language have unusual orthographic and phonetic shapes, not only in Canada but in most countries of the world. This peculiar nature of Hungarian names is the main reason why they are difficult to handle by English speaking Canadians. The spelling and pronunciation of names that originate from cognate languages do not cause problems for the average person, but names from non-cognate languages, like Hungarian, pose difficulties. All Hungarian immigrants are exposed to name related problems, but they are not entirely on their own in finding solutions to the pronunciation of their names. A variety of pronunciations are introduced to them by their neighbors, colleagues and friends in the normal course of daily transactions. These informal pronunciations vary and may be numerous, because those who are in contact with their names and offer advice have no experience in dealing with unknown names that originate in an unknown language. Their solutions have very little onomastic or phonetic rationale. As a result, some Hungarians become accustomed to responding to several different pronunciations of their surnames and the one they hear most often is usually adopted for the sake of simplicity, regardless of the phonetic departure from the original form. For example, Gombóc [gombo:ts] ‘dumpling’ is pronounced as [gambak]. However, within their families and among fellow Hungarians, the proper pronunciation prevails. A common Hungarian surname in Canada is Nagy [nadj] ‘big’, constantly mispronounced either as [negi] or [nedzhi]. But those who have this name prefer the preservation of the original written form and not the adequate phonetic rendition [nadj]. Most Hungarians in Canada retain the original letters of their surnames without retaining the diacritical marks. How is the choice made as to whether to retain or modify the spelling? As far as the individual is concerned, if the name no longer functions in its original form and creates difficulties both in spelling and pronunciation, then a modification is inevitable. Those who prefer phonetic fidelity make spelling modifications in an attempt to have their names pronounced the Hungarian way. This is achieved by modifying the orthographic form in accordance with the sound-letter relationship of the English language. The choice in spelling is decided by the bearer of the name, who in most cases is not trained linguistically: therefore, the exact duplication of the Hungarian pronunciation is not achieved. As a rule, it cannot be achieved because only closely cognate languages offer orthographic forms which are suitable for exact phonetic translation. For example, Németh [ne:met] ‘German’ becomes Namath; Császár [cha:sa:r] ‘emperor’ > Chasar; Csomós [chomo:sh] ‘knotty’ > Chomos; Szabó [sabo:] ‘tailor’ > Sabo; Juhász [juha:s]

‘shepherd’ > Yuhas, and so on. Even then, the name is pronounced largely on the basis of sound similarity because there is no common word stock to consider between the two languages. Most orthographic changes are restricted to the sounds which are denoted by two letter combinations in the Hungarian language and are unfamiliar to English speakers. Some names are shortened in the process. An artist called Devecseri signs his name as Devy, which still sounds extraneous to speakers of the English language, but can be pronounced easily. The number of modified names is statistically low; I estimate them at less than three percent of the approximately 10,000 different Hungarian surnames in Canada. However, it is very unlikely that all individuals having the same surname would choose alteration, as most Hungarians maintain the original spelling as closely as permitted by the English alphabet, even if they must endure phonological mistreatment and have their names assume different meanings in the original Hungarian. The finding that the vast majority of Hungarian immigrants to Canada retain original spellings is natural and expected. Forces stronger than linguistic conformity are at play. A family name continues the lineage from generation to generation. By immigrating, an individual severs all patriotic and family ties, his name may be the only piece of heritage left. In the same vein, a family name is part of any individual’s personal identity and is difficult to surrender or modify.
Surname changes
Complete surname changes among Hungarian-Canadians are very rare, I am aware of only one. András György, a tailor, changed his surname to George for general use. For his clients, he is Mr. Andy George, but his identification papers remained unchanged and carry his original surname György. He established a dual identity: one for official registration and one for business purposes.
CONCLUSION
Hungarian immigrants to Canada have the choice of retaining the original form of their names, including the diacritical marks. However, retention of the diacritical marks, unfamiliar and unrecognizable to Canadian speakers of the official languages, would not only be ineffective but almost impossible, due to the characteristics of the Hungarian alphabet. The original Hungarian pronunciation always changes in Canada because there are no exactly equivalent phonetic values and the succession of sounds is unfamiliar. Phonetic shapes, familiar to English speaking Canadians, have to be found which conform to the familiar combination of sounds. Thus, it would appear to be axiomatic that names from a non-cognate language cannot retain their original forms in a society where an official language is neither phonetically nor orthographically equipped to sustain the non-cognate forms.

Magyar vocabulary meaning 'father' (Ladó 1978: 125). It was the family name of king Aba Sámuel (990-1061) a descendant of the Aba clan. Present-day spelling is apa. Aba is not only a surname but also part of place names mostly in Borsod-AbaújZemplén County. The name and its variants are present in languages other than Hungarian, cf. Akkadian abu 'father' (Labat 1948: No. 145), Latin abavus 'greatgrandfather', old Turkish apa 'ancestor' (Clauson 1972: 5). "Apa tarxan in Chinese references seem to be interpreted as commander-in-chief" (Clauson 1972: 5). Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 Oba; 1240 aba. ABAFI Abafi [abafi]. The patronymic suffix -fi indicates a 'son or descendant’ of Aba. See above for etymology. ABADI Abádi [aba:di]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from the village of Abád, a place which was the location of a ferry on the Tisza river in Heves County near present-day Abádszalók. This area belonged to the Aba clan around the beginning of the second millennium, thus the reference to Aba. The grammatical designator -d is suffixed to the name to denote a place. See Aba for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 960 Obad; 1251 Abaad, Abad. ABAY Abay [abai]. The word-final element -y is the archaic form of the present-day derivational suffix -i that indicates a descendant of Aba. See Aba for etymology. ABDAI. Abdai [abdai]. The name denotes place of origin, a person from Abda a village in Győr-Sopron County. It is comprised of the Sumerian ab 'father', the suffix -da that denotes a place and the derivational suffix -i. See Aba for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling for the toponym Abda: 1153 Obda; 1221 Abada; 1235 Abda. ABODY Abody [abodi]. The archaic derivational suffix -y (present-day -i) indicates a person from the village of Abod in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. The name of the village is derived from the Sumerian Aba 'father' to which the grammatical designator -d is suffixed to indicate a place. See Aba for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling of Abód: 1267 Obod; 1284 Obud; 1332 Opud, Abod. ABONYI Abonyi [abonji]. Someone from the village of Abony in Pest County was named so. The name is comprised of the Sumerian ab 'father', the suffix -ony which in this case forms a collective noun used for the identification of a place associated with the Aba clan and the derivational suffix -i indicating origin. See Aba for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1466 Abon. ACS Ács [a:ch]. An occupational name given to carpenters. It is also the name of a village in Komárom County, where a group of carpenters settled in 1260 (Kiss 1978: 38). Old Hungarian spellings: 1233 Alch; 1533 Acz; 1454 Alcz. The Hungarian ács 'carpenter' may be derived from old Turkish cf. Turkmen agačci 'woodworker' which is compounded from agač 'tree, wood' (agaç in modern Turkish) and the occupational suffix -ci [dzhi]. Another possible source may be the Sumerian ab.uš 'carpenter' (Gostony 1975: 139). ADANYI Adányi [ada:nji]. Also spelled Adonyi. The name contains the root ad 'give, hand over', the formative suffix -ány and the derivational suffix -i. It indicates the descendant of a person who was given up for adoption. The verb ad may be of Finno-Ugric origin, similar but not identical words exist in some of the cognate languages, c. f. Finnish antaa. See Adonyi for more explanation.

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
The place name Adony in Fejér County is named after its founder. The name was spelled Odun in 1200 and Odon in 1332 (Kiss 1978: 39). AFRA Afra [afra]. 'A wanderer or drifter'. The name is the root of the regional expression afrangol 'to wander, to drift' (B. Lőrinczy 1979: 157, vol. 1). AGG Agg [ag]. 'Very old, aged'. The Hungarian agg may be derived from the Sumerian ukkin 'old' (Labat 1948: No. 40). Old Hungarian spelling: 1315 Og; 1372 ag; 1510 agg; 1337 Ogh; 1436 Ag. AGYAS Agyas [adjash]. 'Clever, intelligent'. The old meaning of the Hungarian agy, spelled ag in 1405, was 'skull' and the brain inside it was called agyvelő 'skull-marrow' (Benkő 1967: 105-106, vol. 1). Present-day dictionaries mistakenly list agy as 'brain'. Agy may be an imperfect rendering of the Sumerian ugu 'skull' (Labat 1948: No. 412). The word-final element -as is the adjectival suffix. Old Hungarian spelling: 1353 Agyas. AJKAY Ajkay [ajkai]. 'One who came from Ajka, a city in Veszprém County. The city was named after a person called Ayka (Kiss 1978: 42). The name may be derived from ajak 'lip' and became a surname probably for some odd configuration of the lip. The root ajak is followed by the archaic adjectival suffix -a to implicate condition and the archaic derivational suffix -y to signify origin. The second a in ajak was omitted by syncopation. The origin of ajak is obscure, it may be derived from aj 'opening' according to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language. But ajak 'lips', the plural of aj, suggests differently. The word aj may have denoted the edge or border of anything in the remote past of the Hungarian language. It is still used in this sense as a prefix for border names and names of small valleys or indentation on the side of a mountain among the Székelys of Transylvania (B. Lőrinczy 1979: 173, vol.1). Old Hungarian spelling: 1284 Ayka. AKACHY Akáchy [aka:tsi]. 'Dweller by the acacia grove' as indicated by the archaic derivational suffix -y. The word akác 'acacia' is an international loan word derived from the Greek akakia 'a point' like a thorn. The akác tree has an overabundance of thorns on its branches. Old Hungarian spelling: 1783 ákátz, Akátz; 1788 akász; 1811 Acatia; 1861 ágácz. ALFOLDI. Alföldi [alføldi]. Also spelled Alföldy. 'A dweller in the lowlands' may have been named so. The name is comprised of the prefix al- 'low', föld 'land' and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) that indicates place of origin. Old Hungarian spelling: 1452 Alfewldy. ALMAS Almás. [alma:sh]. 'Seller or grower of apples'. The adjectival suffix -ás is attached to alma 'apple' to indicate occupation. The Hungarian word alma is shared with the Altaic languages cf. Kipchak alma, Chagatai alma, Osmanli elma, Chuvash ulma (Benkő 1967: 140, vol. 1). Similar forms exist in most Turkic languages. Old Hungarian spelling: 1093 Almas. ALPAR Alpár [alpa:r]. The surname may be derived from the old Turkish alp 'hero' and er 'man'. It is also a place name in Csongrád County and part of place names in other parts of Hungary, such as Abaújalpár. Old Hungarian spelling: 896 Olpar, Opar; 1075 Alpar; 1193 Arpario. ANDA Anda [anda]. Anda is the name of an ancient Asian custom practiced by the Mongols, [Scythians and Huns] that recognizes kinship by sworn brotherhood between

non-relatives (Kelly 2008: 51). The ceremony is known as blood oath, where the blood of the covenanters is mingled together in wine and then drunk. This is not a Magyar custom; it was practiced by their Hun and Hungar ruling caste in antiquity. Translated into the Magyar language, it is called vérszerződés. ANTAL Antal [antal]. Also spelled Antha, Anthal, Anton, Antóny Antos. This name may be the Hungarian variant of the Roman Antonius (Ladó 1978: 132) which has been translated as 'deserving praise' (Thatcher 1971: 329). The Sumerian an-ta-lu 'chief, boss' is also a possibility, an-ta means ‘above’ and lu 'man, male' (Deimel 1939: No. 12, 191). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Antu; 1208 Antoneu, Anthoneu; 1211 Anta; 1215 Anthonius, Anthonio. APATHY Apáthy [apa:ti]. 'Descendant of the abbot'. The name is a relic from the past when Roman Catholic priests were not required to be celibate. Apát is the Hungarian equivalent of the English abbot 'head of a group of monks in a monastery'. The letter h marks the reduced plosiveness of the preceding t. The word-final element -y is the archaic grapheme for the present-day derivational suffix -i. Another interpretation of the name may be 'of the abbey', denoting an employee in the household of an abbot. The word apát is comprised of the root apa 'father' and the suffix -át which converts verbs and nouns to derived nouns. The ultimate source of apa is the Sumerian ab 'father'. See Aba for etymology. The variants of apát are present in languages other than Hungarian. Cf. Latin abbas, Syrian abba, English abbot, French abbé, German Abt, western Slavic opat. Old Hungarian spelling: 1182 Apati; 1211 Apat; 1291 Abbati. APOR Apor [apor]. A difficult name to etymologize. The earliest known Apor was a military leader in 934 (Györffy 1975: 295). May be derived from the old Turkish apar ‘unruly, disobedient’ (Németh 1991: 124-125). APPONYI Apponyi [aponji]. A variant of Abonyi. ARADI. Aradi [aradi]. 'A person from Arad' a city in Arad of historical Hungary, confined to Romania in 1920. The name is derived from the Hungarian úr 'sir, lord, gentleman' (Kiss 1978: 59), which in turn is derived from the Sumerian ur 'man, hero’ (Labat 1948: No. 575). The grammatical designator -ad denotes a place. The derivational suffix -i indicates place of origin. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Vradi, Vrodi, Vrovdi, Arud, Arod, Arudi, Arhudi; 1202 Orod; 1237 Arad. ARANY Arany [aranj]. The Hungarian arany 'gold' may be derived from the Sumerian ar 'to shine' (Labat 1948: No. 451). The nominal suffix -any converts a verb into a noun. The Sumerian ara 'to glow' (Labat 1948: No. 451) may also be considered, though it appears to be an adjective in view of the suffix -a: 'glowing'. The name may have been bestowed on a wealthy individual or golden-haired (blond) person. Similar words are in the Finno-Ugric languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *sarańa (Benkő 1967: 170, vol. 1). Also compare with Latin aurum, Avestan zaranyaand Sanskrit hiranya-. Old Hungarian spelling: 1267 Aran-; 1391 Arany. ARATO Arató [arato:]. Also spelled Arathó, the h marks the reduced plosiveness of the



17
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
preceding t. The present participle -ó forms an adjective from arat 'to reap, to harvest, to cut down'. Arató 'harvester' denotes a seasonal worker in agriculture. If the -at ending in arat is the frequentative suffix, which it appears to be, then the root of the word would be ar. In that case the Hungarian ar is identical with the Sumerian ar4 'reap, harvest' (Labat 1948: No. 594). Similar words exist in languages other than Hungarian cf. Vogul urel, old Turkish or and Tatar ur 'reap, harvest' (Benkő 1967: 172, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling: 1423 Aratho; 1461 Arato. ARGYELAN Árgyelán [a:rdjela:n]. Árgyelán is a name for a Transylvanian in Moldavia. ARVA Árva [a:rva]. 'Orphan'. Also the name of a river in historical Hungary now in Slovakia renamed Orava. Similar words exist in other languages, cf. Finnish orpo, Latin orbus, Greek orphanos, Ostyak urui.
Old Hungarian spelling: 1152 Arua. ASZODI Aszódi [aso:di]. Also spelled Aszódy. 'One who came from Aszód', a town in Pest County. The name contains the following elements: aszó 'intermittent stream', the grammatical designator -d denoting a place and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicating place of origin. Old Hungarian spelling: 1401 Aza; 1647 Aszód. ASZTALOS Asztalos [astalosh]. ‘Joiner’, literally 'maker of tables'. Compound of asztal 'table', and the adjectival suffix –os. An occupational name, describes a craftsman specializing in making furniture. The word asztal appears to be of old Greek origin, derived from astilos 'post, pillar'. Tables and the stools around them were not always portable as they are now and the floors in houses were of compacted earth. The legs of a table were four posts, dug into the floor to support a slab of wood which served as a table-top. One short post for each stool was also dug into the floor around the table. As it happened, the Greeks call their table trapeze 'a flat surface', e.g. table-top, while Hungarians put the emphasis on the raised position of the structure by its legs and called it asztal. Old Hungarian spellings for asztal: 1293 oztol; 1354 aztal. AVAR Avar [avar]. Name of the Turkic people who ruled the upper Danube valley, the Carpathian Basin and the regions extending beyond Central Asia in the east after the collapse of the Hun Empire. The Avars shaped the course of history in the Carpathian Basin prior to the arrival of Árpád's people who were also of Turkish stock. The name Avar is derived from the old Turkish tribal name Apar 'unruly, disobedient' (Németh 1991: 124-125). Old Hungarian spelling: 950 Avar; 1760 Avar; 1783 Abar; 1801 Abár. BAB Bab [bab]. 'Bean'. The name may indicate a person small in stature, cf. Babszem Jankó 'Johny Bean seed', a diminutive character in Hungarian fairy tales. Hungarians share the word for bean with Slavonic speaking people where it is spelled bob. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Bab. BACS Bács [ba:ch]. A name of Turkic origin. In modern Turkish baş means 'head, chief, leader' (Akdikmen 1986: 43), denoting a civilian dignitary or a military governor. It was also the name of a County and a city in the southern part of the Bácska region of historical Hungary. The area was confined to Serbia in 1920 and renamed

Vojvodina.
Old Hungarian spelling: 1071 Bach; 1111 Bache; 1252 Baach; 1590 Bacz; 1692 bács-. BADA Bada [bada]. A variant of Buda. See Buda. BAJAN Baján [baja:n]. Derived from the name of an Avar military leader who died in AD 602. It was a high ranking Avar military and administrative title derived from the Turkish bay 'rich', "with extended meanings like 'a member of the upper classes’ occasionally 'a man of distinction' " (Clauson 1972: 384). Wealth and leadership were synonymous in antiquity, thus the title. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Boion. BAJTAR Bajtár [bajta:r]. Hungarian rendition of the Turkish baytar 'veterinarian' (Akdikmen 1986: 46). BAJUSZ Bajusz [bajus]. 'Mustache'. A name probably given to one who had a thick prominent mustache. Old Hungarian spelling: 1522 Baÿws; 1535 baiuz; 1552 baiusz; 1604 Bajutz; 1780 bajusz. BAJZA Bajza [bajza]. A regional expression in Tiszadob (Szabolcs-Szatmár County) denoting a 'playful, merry' person (B. Lőrinczy 1979: 313, vol. 1). BAKA Baka [baka]. 'Foot-soldier'. It may be derived from boka 'ankle', the onetime name of 'ankle-boots', the standard foot-ware in the Hungarian army, which transformed into the name of soldiers wearing them (Benkő 1967: 221, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling: 1135 Baca; 1227 Boca; 1418 Baka. BAKO Bakó [bako:]. 'Executioner, hangman'. A derivation from the obsolete bak ‘chopping-block’ to which the participle -ó is suffixed to indicate an occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1271 Bakov; 1338 Bakou; 1345 Bakow; 1418 Bako. BAKSAY Baksay [bakshai]. 'Descendant of Baksa' as indicated by the archaic derivational suffix -y. Baksa is the old Hungarian name for csikó 'foal' (Szamota 19021906: 44). It is also the name of a village in Baranya County probably named so for horse-breeding. BALLA Balla [bala]. The name has no meaning in the current Hungarian language but it means 'cap' in Sumerian (Labat 1948: No. 536). A cap-maker may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1214 Balu, Ballu. BAL Bal [bal]. Literally bal means 'left' but metaphorically the word is associated with anything ‘bad, ill or adverse’. Cf. balsors 'misfortune', baleset 'accident', balsiker 'failure'. In the literal sense the surname Bal may denote a 'left-handed' person but the metaphoric perception suggests an 'ill tempered' or 'accident prone' individual. The Sumerian bal 'hostile, adverse' (Gostony 1975: 42) is similar to the metaphoric sense of the Hungarian bal, both denote unfavorable conditions. Old Hungarian spelling: 1181 Bol; 1213 Bolu; 1372 bal. BALGA Balga [balga]. A variant of bolygó 'wanderer'. Originally a 'vagrant' was called balga (Benkő 1967: 229, vol. 1), but the word is now describes an 'unassuming, naive' person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1343 Bolgo-; 1359 Bolgow-; 1484 Balgo; 1496 Bolygo; 1777 Balga. BALINT Bálint [ba:lint]. Hungarian variant of the Roman Valentinus 'strong, healthy'.



19
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
The letters v and b are regarded transposable. The Roman name originates from the Latin valens, valeo 'strong, muscular'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1558 Baint; 1577 Walent, Walint, Walynth; 1584 Balinth; 1587 Bálint. BALLAGI Ballagi [balagi]. The reduplicated l marks a stressed consonant. The name is comprised of ballag 'walk slowly' and the derivational suffix -i indicating the descendant of a slow walker. Old Hungarian spelling: 1504 Ballago; 1519 ballag-. BALOG Balog [balog]. Also spelled Balogh. 'Left-handed', derived from bal 'left'. The og ending is an archaic suffix that denoted a permanent condition like in hályog 'cataract'. Balog was also a clan name in Gömör County of historical Hungary in AD 900 near a tributary of the Rima River called Balog (Györffy 1987: 463-465). The area is now confined to Slovakia and renamed Vel'ký Blh. According to historical sources members of the Hungarian border patrol were stationed there (Györffy 1987: 463-465), which would indicate the Sumerian bulug 'boundary, frontier'(Labat 1948: No. 96) as the possible alternative source of the name. Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 bolug; 1297 Balug; 1338 Bolugh; 1391 Balogh; 1381 Balog. BALSA Balsa [balsha]. The archaic form of balsó 'on the left' that may indicate someone dwelling on the left side of a geographical feature. Balsa is also the name of a populated place in Szabolcs-Szatmár County first recorded in 1291. BALTAS Baltás [balta:sh]. The adjectival suffix -ás indicates a user, maker or seller of balta 'axe, hatchet'. The word balta is present in all Turkic languages (Clauson 1972: 333), but may have originated in the Sumerian language, cf. bal 'hatchet, axe' (Gostony 1975: 80). Also compare with Akkadian pâltu 'axe' (Labat 1948: No. 595). Old Hungarian spelling: 1429 Baltha. BAN Bán [ba:n]. Also spelled Baán. The name was originally the archaic title of the warden for the Bánát in the southern regions of historical Hungary and the viceroy of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia. The title is similar to the Hungarian verb bán (-ik) 'to treat, to handle, to manage'. The suffix -ik marks a reflexive verb. The Sumerians used both ban and pan to denote an estate held by a superior on condition of feudal obligations (Labat 1948: No. 439). A person of distinction was called banî in the Akkadian language (Labat 1948: No. 144). Old Hungarian spelling: 1171 ban; 1211 Ban-; 1289 Baan-; 1309 Ban. BANATI Bánáti [ba:na:ti]. Also spelled Bánáthy, 'one who came from the Bánát', as indicated by the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). Bánát is a region at the south-east corner of the Great Hungarian Plain. This area was divided then confined to Romania and Serbia in 1920. The name is derived from bán 'viceroy', see above for detailed etymology. The suffix -át converts verbs and nouns into derived nouns. BANYASZ Bányász [ba:nja:s]. The formative suffix –ász attached to bánya 'mine, quarry' indicates a specialized occupation: 'miner'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1463 Banyaz; 1602 Baniaz, Bányász. BARA Bara [bara]. This name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian

language. The most probable origin would be the Sumerian bar 'leather' which compares favorably with the Hungarian bőr 'leather' (Labat 1948: No. 74). The word-final element a is the Sumerian and ancient Hungarian adjectival suffix signifying a 'leather-worker' or 'seller of leather goods'. The modern equivalent of the archaic Bara is bőrös 'a dealer in leather goods'. The old form was preserved in the name Baros and Baross. BARANY Bárány [ba:ra:nj]. 'Lamb'. One may have been named so for tending lambs or for being docile. The Hungarian bárány may be derived from the Sumerian udubar-rinna 'lamb' (Gostony 1975: 80 (#650). Similar words exist in the Slavonic languages cf. Polish baran 'ram'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1194 Baran; 1598 Báránt; 1604 Bárány. BARCS Barcs [barch]. The name of a village in Somogy County bears the name of its founder. The surname Barcs is of uncertain origin. It may be derived from the Turkish burç 'tower, bastion', or the also Turkish bars 'leopard'. See below for more explanation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1279 Barch. BARCZA Barcza [bartsa]. The root barc may be the Hungarian variant of the old Turkish bars 'leopard' (Kiss 1978: 91) spelled pars in modern Turkish. The archaic Hungarian adjectival suffix -a suggests a person who is 'like a leopard' either by appearance or in character. The name may have been bestowed on a nobleman wearing the traditional kacagány made of leopard skin thrown loosely over one shoulder. A fashionable garb among the Turkish ruling class in medieval Hungary. Place names derived from Barca were numerous in the Transylvanian region of historical Hungary until confined to Romania in 1920. Barcaság was a locality in the south-east part of Transylvania. Barcánfalva now called Bîrsana, Barcaszentpéter now called Sînpetru, Barcaújfalu now called Satu Nou. The Polish barc 'beehive' and the Italian barca 'boat' have no relevance to the Hungarian name. Old Hungarian spelling: 1272 Borch; 1278 Barch. BAROSS The reduplicated ‘s’ indicates a stressed consonant. The name is derived from the Sumerian bar ‘skin, leather’ (Labat 1948: cuneiform no. 74), cf. Hungarian bőr ‘skin, leather’. The adjectival suffix -os indicates an occupation: maker of leather goods. The modern Hungarian equivalent is bőrös. BARS Bars [barsh]. The name of a county and its first steward in medieval Hungary (Kiss 1978: 93). The entire county was confined to Slovakia in 1920. The village Óbars was renamed Stary Tekov. The name is a probable derivation from the Turkish pars ‘leopard’. The form bars is shared with very early Iranian, probably a loan-word. It is one of the animals of the 12 year Turkic animal cycle (Clauson 1972: 368). BARTA Barta [barta]. Also spelled Bartha. A common Hungarian surname compounded of two Sumerian elements: bar 'circular wall' (Deimel 1939: No. 49) and ta 'outside' (Labat 1948: No. 89). The present-day Hungarian equivalent of bar is vár 'fort'. The letters b and v are regarded as transposable. Várta 'sentry-post' seems to be the phonetically advanced form of Barta. Sentries were always posted outside the walls of forts and this is what both barta and várta describe. The name may have become popular as a collective noun when

families settled in the vicinity of fortifications and were referred to as bartas, i.e. those outside the wall of the fort. Old Hungarian spelling: 1576 Bartha; 1595 Barta. BATO Bató [bato:]. The name is comprised of the Sumerian bat 'bat, scepter, stave' (Waddell 1927: 23), identical with the Hungarian bot both in meaning and phonetic value. The Hungarian participle -ó suffixed to bat indicates a 'person in charge'. Names derived from bot 'stick' denoted leaders in ancient Hungarian society, cf. botos 'overseer' (B. Lőrinczy 1979: 574, vol. 1). The oldest record of Bató is noted in AD 6 as the name of two leaders when the Pannonians and their neighbors the Illirs had risen against Roman rule (Cook 1934: 369, vol. 10). BATOR Bátor [ba:tor]. 'Brave, daring'. The name is of old Turkic origin cf. Osmanli batir 'brave, hero', Mongolian bayatur 'hero, brave'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Bahatur; 1177 Batur; 1323 Bathor-. BAZSA Bazsa [bazha]. A derivation from bazsaly(-og) 'a concealed smile' (Benkő 1967: 258, vol. 1). A person habitually smiling in such a way may have been named Bazsa. The name is comprised of the root bazs and the archaic adjectival suffix -a to indicate character. The word bazsaly is a regional dialect derived from mosoly 'smile'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Basa, Bosa. BEKES Békés [be:ke:sh]. 'Peaceful, gentle'. The name contains béke 'peace' and the present-day adjectival suffix -s. It is also the name of a county and a city in Hungary. Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 bekes; 1202 Beques; 1215 Bikes. BELA Béla [be:la]. One of the most difficult Hungarian names to interpret. The following explanations have been proposed: 1. From the archaic Hungarian word bél 'internal parts' of the body (Kálmán 1978: 42) [present meaning is 'intestines'] and the suffix –a. 2. From the Turkic languages where it means 'noble'. 3. The endearing form of the Slavic Boleslav. 4. From the Hebrew Bela 'swallower of earth'. 5. The endearing form of the German Berta or Bella (Ladó 1978: 138). 6. Akkadian bêlu cognate with ba'al 'lord'. The most probable source for the name may be the Sumerian language where be means 'lord, nobleman' (Labat 1948: No. 69, 99), and lu is 'man' (Labat 1948: No. 330). The Semitic Akkadians borrowed it in the form of bêlu. The Turkish bey 'sir, ruler' (Akdikmen 1986: 49) may have also been derived from the Sumerian be. Old Hungarian spelling: 1092 Bela; 1168 beel; 1219 Belh; 1221 Bella; 1597 Bélla. BEREND Berend [berend]. The surname Berend is derived from the name of an old Turkic tribe that settled in Keve County of historical Hungary in the 11th century. The place of their settlement was also called Berend at first and then changed to Baranda (Györffy 1987: 315, vol. 3). This area was confined to Serbia in 1920 but the name remained Baranda. Berend may be derived from the old Turkic *berendi 'one who surrendered' (Kiss 1978: 702). Old Hungarian spelling: 1340 Berend.

BERES Béres [be:resh]. 'Farmhand'. Derived from bér 'wage' and suffixed by the adjective -es it denotes a ‘hired hand’. The word béres may have been derived from the Sumerian ubara 'fees, dues, settlement' (Gostony 1975: 65). Old Hungarian spelling: 1387 Beres; 1602 Béres. BESE. Bese [beshe]. The old name of a raptorial bird, probably of present-day sólyom 'falcon'. It appears to be cognate with the Uighur baša 'falcon, hawk' (Benkő 1967: 288, vol. 1). A keeper or trainer of falcons may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Bese. BESENYO Besenyő [beshenjø:]. The name is derived from the ethnic denomination Besenyő 'Pecheneg'. It was the name of a Turkic people who settled in Hungary during the second half of the 10th century. They dispersed throughout historical Hungary. Records show the presence of Pechenegs in about fifty localities. The counties with substantial Pecheneg population are Heves, Fejér, Győr, Nyitra, Sopron, Csanád, Tolna and Somogy (Ács 1986: 32, 33). The origin of their name is obscure, possibly derived from the Turkic bača 'brother-in-law' according to one source (Németh 1991: 85). Another possible origin is the Uighur baša 'falcon, hawk', denoting a people being experts in falconry. The present form for Besenyő in the Turkish language is baçanak (Akdikmen 1986: 37). Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 Beseneu; 1211 Beseney; 1279 Besenev; 1322 Bessenew; 1455 Besenyw. BESZEDES Beszédes [bese:esh]. The adjectival suffix -es is added to beszéd 'speech, oration' to indicate a ‘chatty’ person or one ‘having oratorical skills’. Though the word beszéd is shared with some of the Slavonic languages (cf. Slovak beseda) its ultimate origin may be the Sumerian bé 'to speak, to talk' (Labat 1948: No. 214). Old Hungarian spelling: 1403 Bezedes; 1575 beszédes. BIRO Bíró [bi:ro:]. The participle -ó is suffixed to the verb bir 'to have power' (Benkő 1967: 305, vol. 1). Before the establishment of courts of law, distinguished members of communities were vested with authority to settle disputes between litigious parties. Those people were called bíró 'judge'. In small communities, up to the end of World War II, a bíró was elected to govern and to maintain the law. He was also the chief administrator of the village. Old Hungarian spelling: 1306 Byrou; 1354 Byrow, Byro; 1423 Biro. BOD Bod [bod]. The archaic spelling of the present-day bot 'stick, club'. This kind of name was given to a leader in ancient Hungarian society. The letters t and d are regarded transposable. See Buda for additional pertinent detail. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Bod. BODA Boda [boda]. A variant of Buda, the archaic form of the current Botos 'one with a stick'. The name is comprised of bod the old form of bot 'stick, club' and the archaic adjectival suffix -a. It denotes a leader. See Buda for additional detail. Old Hungarian spelling: 1202 Boda. BODO Bodó [bodo:]. The participle -ó is suffixed to bod the archaic form of the current bot 'stick, club' to indicate a leader. See Bod, Boda and Buda for more detail. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Bodou. BODOGH Bódogh [bo:dog]. The name is the archaic form of the present-day boldog



23
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
'happy, joyous'. The letter h marks the reduced plosion of the preceding g. The Hungarian boldog may be derived from the Sumerian ba-dug or ba-a-u-dug 'happy (Gostony 1975: 22, 143). Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 Bodogh; 1700 boldog. BOJTAR Bojtár [bojta:r]. 'Young herdsman'. Bojt appears to be a variant of bujt 'initiate movement or action' (Benkő 1967: 383, vol. 1). The element -ár corresponds to the Sumerian úr 'man' (Labat 1948: No. 575), affected by vowel harmony. Old Hungarian spelling: 1660 bujtár; 1742 Bojtár; 1898 bajtár. BOKOR Bokor [bokor]. 'Bush'. The name suggests a dweller by a bushy, scrubby area. Old Hungarian spelling: 1055 bukur; 1095 bucur; 1193 Bocor; 1330 bukur; 1415 Bokor. BOR Bor [bor]. A maker or seller of wine may have been named so. The Hungarian bor 'wine' is also present in the Turkic languages cf. Uighur bor, Kipchak bor (Benkő 1967: 341, vol. 1). However, the ultimate source may be the Sumerian bur 'wine' (Gostony 1975: 72, 85). Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 bor. BOROS Bőrös [bø:røsh]. 'Leather-dealer, tanner'. The adjectival suffix -ös is attached to bőr 'leather' to indicate occupation. The Hungarian bőr has a dual meaning 'skin' and 'leather', same as the Sumerian bar ( Labat 1948: No. 74). Old Hungarian spelling: 1219 Boroch. BORSOS Borsos [borshosh]. The name is comprised of bors 'pepper' and the adjectival suffix -os and denotes a ‘seller of peppers’. The word bors is present in the Turkic languages in the form of burç and murç, probably derived from the Iranian marc (Benkő 1967: 349, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling: 1075 Bors; 1215 Burs; 1395 bors; 1469 bars-. BOTA. Bota [bota]. The archaic form of the present-day Botos 'one with a stick'. The archaic adjectival suffix is affixed to bot 'stick, club' to indicate a 'leader, overseer'. See Bod, Boda and Buda for more detail. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Bota, Bote, Bata. BOTOS Botos [botosh]. An official entrusted with the administration and security of a community is called botos in a regional dialect (B. Lőrinczy 1979: 574, vol. 1). Literally, botos means 'one who carries a staff, stick'. The name is comprised of bot 'stick, staff' and the adjectival suffix -os to indicate status or rank. The Hungarian bot is probably related to the Turkish budak 'twig, branch'. See Buda for more detail and etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Botus, butus; 1347 Buthus; 1356 Bothus; 1426 Bothos; 1602 Botos. BUCSUS Búcsús [bu:chu:sh]. A búcsús could be either a participant in a pilgrimage to a holy place or a merchant who sells devotional articles to pilgrims. The name is comprised of búcsú 'pilgrimage' and the adjectival suffix -s. The Hungarian búcsú may be derived from the Sumerian búr-ša, búr-šu 'deliverance of heart' (Gostony 1975: 49). Old Hungarian spelling of búlcsú: 1095 buchu; 1198 Bulchov; 1199 Bolchu; 1210 Bulsuu; 1211 Bolchou, Bolsou. BUDA Buda [buda]. Originally an ancient title or rank, Buda was preserved in surnames and place names in historical Hungary. The name is comprised of bud the old form of the



24
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
present-day bot 'bat, stick, staff' and the archaic adjectival suffix -a, that was present in the Sumerian and old Hungarian languages. The bat or staff, an ancient symbol of authority, lent its name to denote a leader or ruler and became a title both in the Sumerian and old Hungarian cultures. The Hungarian bud is the variant of the Sumerian bad, bat 'bat, club, stick (Nogrady 1996: 52). The Buda segment in Budapest signifies that the head of state, the buda resided there. The following Hungarian surnames are derived from the same root as Buda: Bot, Both, Bod, Bud, Bada, Boda, Bató; Bota; Bata; Batu; Batta; Botus; Botos; Bodos; Budus; Butus; Bothu; Boton; Botond; Bodon; Bodun; Botona. The earliest known record of Buda is from the fifth century, the name of a local leader, mistakenly identified as the brother of Attila, king of the Huns. BUJDOSO Bújdosó [bu:jdosho:]. Derived from búj 'hide', followed by the connecting consonant d, the adjectival suffix -os and the participle -ó, bujdosó is a 'fugitive, refugee'. Hungary had plenty of refugees during her turbulent history. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Budusuo; 1416 budoso-. CAKO Cakó [tsako:]. Also spelled Czakó. The old name for the present-day gólya 'stork'. The dweller of a house that had a stork nest may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1426 Chako; 1565 czakô; 1629 czákó; 1808 cika. CSABA Csaba [chaba]. One of the oldest personal names in Hungary that, according to historians, was given to the youngest son of Attila, king of the Huns. He was Attila's favored son, designated to succeed him in leading the Hun nation. The name has always been associated with the Turkish language by Hungarian linguists. It is supposed to be a derivation from the Chagatai čaba 'gift' (Kiss 1978: 99) or from the Osmanli Turk çoban 'shepherd, wanderer’ (Ladó 1978: 146). The problem with the Osmanli Turk derivation is that the word çoban, Hungarian spelling csobán, was absent in the Hungarian vocabulary until 1579 (Benkő 1967: 546, vol. 1), well after the Turkish conquest in 1526. Furthermore, the Turkish çoban appears to be a derivation from the Persian shaban 'shepherd' (Lambton 1954: 93). In addition, calling the crown prince of the Hun ruling caste a shepherd would have been inconsistent with contemporary Turkish naming practices, which tended to indicate noble origin. But Prince Csaba, without the Turkish connection, is a legendary figure in Hungarian folklore; he is supposed to return, riding along the Milky Way, to liberate the Magyars from foreign oppression. His name can be etymologized in the Sumerian language: ša6 means 'favorable, preferred' (Labat 1948: No. 356) and be (listed as ba9 in the index) means 'lord' (Labat 1948: No. 69). The compound šaba would then mean 'favorable lord'. The sound change from s [English sh, Sumerian š] to cs [English ch] frequently occurs in the Hungarian language, cf. sajka > csajka 'boat'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1151 Caba; 1237 Chaba. CSAKANY Csákány [tsa:ka:nj]. Also present in the Slavonic and Turkic languages in similar forms, csákány 'pick-axe' denotes a maker or seller of pick-axes. The most likely origin of the root csák is the Sumerian sig 'to hit, to crush' (Labat 1948: No. 295). It compares with the Hungarian csap 'to hit, to strike' and the Turkish çakmak 'to hit, to strike'. The nominal suffix -ány is appended to the root word to transform it into a noun. Old Hungarian spelling: 1277 Chakan; 1490 Chykan; 1520 czakan; 1602 Csákán, Csákány. It is also a surname in Kazakhstan and Kirghizstan spelled Čakan (Benkő

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
19967: 469, vol. 1). CSAKO Csákó [cha:ko:]. A maker or supplier of csákó 'shako, cap' to the Hungarian military may have been named so. The shape of a modern csákó resembles a truncated cone but it resembled a tall sugar loaf in antiquity, ending in a point. The point was bent down to one side occasionally. The word csákó is comprised of csák 'pointed end, tip' (Benkő 1967: 468, vol.1) and the participle -ó. Derivation from the Sumerian sag-šu4 'headgear' or the Akkadian šaku 'high, tall' (Deimel 1939: No. 252) should also be considered. Old Hungarian spelling: 1667 Csákó. CSAP Csap [tsap]. A maker of spigots may have received the name. Csap means 'tap, spigot' in the Hungarian language and signifies the action of cutting off the flow of liquid. It appears to be a derivation from the Sumerian ša5 'to cut' (Labat 1948: No. 97), or šub 'to separate, to severe' (Labat 1948: No. 68). A similar Hungarian word is szelep 'valve' derived from szel 'slice, cut'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1458 Chap; 1490 Chyap; 1591 csap-. CSEKE Cseke [cheke]. Also spelled Csekő. 'Dweller at the ford'. The old Hungarian name of a ford was cseke (B. Lőrinczy 1962: 35). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Ceke; 1211 Cheke, Cheken. CSENDES Csendes [chendesh]. 'Quiet, placid'. The name is a composite of csend 'silence, tranquility' and the adjectival suffix -es to indicate personal character. The word csend may be derived from the Sumerian šed7 'calm down' (Deimel 1939: No. 32), or še12 'calm' (Labat 1948: No. 103a). Old Hungarian spelling: 1277 Chundus; 1478 Chendes. CSEPLO Cséplő [che:plø:]. Abbreviated form of csépelő 'thresher'. The vowel e is omitted by syncopation. The participle -ő indicates occupation. The word csép may be derived from the Sumerian šub 'to separate, to drop, to fall' ((Labat 1948: No. 68). Threshing is about separating the grain from its capsule. The last act of threshing by hand was to drop the grain from a height for the wind to blow away the light grain-husks. Old Hungarian spelling: 1409 Cheplew; 1483 Cheplee; 1540 Tschyplew; 1548 czyeplo; 1602 Cséplő. CSER Cser [cher]. 'Oak'. The Hungarian cser is derived from the Latin cerus 'oak-tree'. The name indicates a person having the characteristics of an oak-tree, the symbol of strength and endurance. Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 cher; 1285 cheer. CSEREPES Cserepes [cherepesh]. 'Potter, tiler'. The name consists of cserép 'flower pot, roof-tile' and the adjectival suffix -es to indicate occupation. Cserép may be derived from the Sumerian še-ib 'tile' (Gostony 1975: 81). Old Hungarian spelling: 1337 Cheripes; 1388 Cherepes; 1584 cserepes. CSERGEI Csergei [chergei]. Also spelled Csergey and Csurgai. The derivational suffix i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Cserge. The word cser is an altered form of csor (as in csorog 'trickle, dribble') or csur (as in csurog 'trickle, dribble') and may be a derivation from the Sumerian šur 'to spout out, to gush' and 'rain, shower' (Labat 1948: No. 101). The -og ending is the Hungarian frequentative suffix. The cserge was a portable bathing apparatus of the Scythians. A leather water

tank with holes in it was placed in an elevated position and water spurted down as it does from a shower-head. The maker or caretaker of such baths was called Cserge or Csurga. This bath was recorded as tzerga by the Greek emperor Constantinus Porphyrogenitus (905-959) in his De administrando imperio. He (mistakenly) refers to it as a 'Turkish bath', namely “skytha tzerga”. This would be explained by a similar word in old Turkish: çur [chur] "an onomatopoeic for the sound of milk falling from the udder into the pail; also used of any liquid when it makes a noise" (Clauson 1972: 428). This interpretation of the Turkish çur is not convincing because identical words in cognate languages clearly describe the action of liquid gushing or trickling from a container. This action can take place with or without the presence of a pail. The -ge ending in cserge is the archaic Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a that was subjected to phonetic change by the rules of vowel harmony and changed to -e. Deimel suggests that the suffix -a is occasionally preceded by either a g or a k (Deimel 1939: 108 in section 29 Adjektiv und Adverb). Csorog is also present in the Uralic languages in various forms having the same meaning as in Hungarian and Sumerian. The reconstructed Uralic proto-word is *ćorɜ (Benkő 1967: 557, vol. 1). CSIGA Csiga [chiga]. 'Snail'. The name may mark a person for being 'slow like a snail'. The Hungarian csiga may be derived from the Sumerian šika 'shell' (snail, oyster) (Labat 1948: No. 55). Old Hungarian spelling: 1272 chyga; 1395 chÿga; 1863 tsuga-. CSILLAG Csillag [chilag]. 'Star'. A name given for no obvious reason. May be a derivation from the Sumerian zalag 'to shine' (Labat 1948: No. 393). Old Hungarian spelling: 1373 Chylagh; 1388 chilak; 1799 csillag-. CSINOS Csinos [chinosh]. 'Neat, elegant'. The name is comprised of csín 'neatness, elegance' and the adjectival suffix -os. The word csín may be derived from the Sumerian šen 'clean, distinguishing, pure' (Labat 1948: No. 8). Old Hungarian spelling: 1604 Czinos. CSORGO Csörgő [chørgø:]. Derived from csörög 'chatter' to which the participle -ő is suffixed to indicate a 'chatterer'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 Chergou; 1585 tsergo. CSUROS Csűrös [chy:røsh]. An occupational surname indicated by the adjectival suffix ös. It denotes a farm-hand who looks after the csűr 'cattle or fodder shed'. The word csűr is a probable derivation from the Sumerian šurim 'cattle shed, paddock' (Labat 1948: No. 494). Being a German loan-word derived from Scheuer [correct spelling Scheune] 'barn', as suggested by the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, is doubtful. Old Hungarian spelling: 1570 Churos. CSURGAI Csurgai [churgai]. See Csergei. CUPPAN Cuppan [tsupan]. A person giving loud kisses may have been named Cuppan 'smacker'. The root cupp may be derived from the Sumerian su-ub 'kiss' (Deimel 1939: No. 7). However, the Sumerian su-ub may mean 'suck' instead of 'kiss'. The action performed by the mouth during a kiss is similar to the vacuum created by the muscles of the lips when drawing milk into the mouth during breast feeding. Therefore the habit of



27
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
kissing may have originated either from breast or mouth to mouth feeding of infants when hard food had to be pre-chewed by the mother for her toothless baby. The Sumerian su-ub is phonetically close to the Hungarian szop [sop] 'suck' and cupp [tsup] the sound of a smack. Old Hungarian spelling: 1652 czoppan-; 1787 tzuppan-; 1805 cippan-; 1820 cuppan. DAJKA Dajka [dajka]. 'Wet nurse'. This name is a relic from the distant past. Words of similar forms and meaning are present in many other languages like old Hindi dháyati 'suck, drink'. Farsi dâyag 'wet nurse' (Benkő 1967: 876, vol. 3), Serbo-Croatian dojka 'woman's breast', Sumerian ga-i-ka 'wet nurse' (Gostony 1975: 85). The Hungarian dajka is most likely derived from tej 'milk' (phonetic values may have changed in the following order: tej > dej > daj) and the archaic adjectival suffix -a. The present-day equivalent would be tejes 'one who has milk'. The intermediate k is a connecting consonant. Old Hungarian spelling: 1359 Dejka; 1481 Dayka; 1603 Dajka. DALA Dala [dala]. The archaic form of Dalos 'singer, fond of singing'. Consists of dal 'song' and the archaic adjectival suffix -a. The Hungarian dal may be of Sumerian origin c.f. gala 'song' (Gostony 1975: 65). See Dalos. DALOS Dalos [dalosh]. Also spelled Dallos. The adjectival suffix -os is added to dal 'song' to indicate a person 'fond of singing'. See Dala for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Dolus; 1416 Dalus; 1437 Dalos. DAMA Dama [dama]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. Its source may be the Sumerian dam 'guardian, support' (Gostony 1975: 56). Dam compares favorably with the Hungarian gyám 'guardian' and tám 'support'. The word-final element a is the Sumerian and old Hungarian adjectival suffix indicating status. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Tama; 1237 Dama. DARABOS Darabos [darabosh]. The adjectival suffix -os is appended to darab 'part, piece' to indicate an awkward person who expresses himself in short unrelated sentences. The root dar may be the same as the Sumerian dar 'split, break up' (Deimel 1939: No. 93). The word-final element -ab in darab is an unproductive suffix of unidentified origin. Also compare with Sumerian dur 'part, section' (Labat 1948: No. 108). Old Hungarian spelling: 1305 dorobus; 1335 Darabus; 1407 Darabos. DARAS Darás [dara:sh]. The adjectival suffix -ás follows the root dar from which dara 'groats', darál 'grind' and darabol 'break or cut into pieces' are derived. The name Darás denotes a person involved in either the production or selling of groats. The act of grinding is in fact the breaking up grain into small pieces, an action expressed by the Sumerian dar 'to break up, to cut to pieces' (Deimel 1939: No. 93). The Turkish dari 'millet', listed in the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language as the source from which dara is derived (Benkő 1967: 593, vol. 1), is questionable. DARAZS Darázs [dara:zh]. 'Wasp'. A name given for no obvious reason. It may be derived from the Sumerian dar 'motley' (Labat 1948: No. 114). The last syllable -ázs appears to be the voiced variant of the adjectival suffix -ás. Old Hungarian spelling: 1349 Daras. DARDA Dárda [da:rda]. An occupational surname. A maker or seller of dárda 'spear,



28
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
lance' may have been named so. A soldier serving in the army as a ‘lancer’ may also have received the name. An international loan-word dárda is believed to be derived from the Latin dard 'dart' (Benkő 1967: 595, vol. 1) to which the archaic Hungarian suffix -a is suffixed. Old Hungarian spelling: 1554 darda; 1585 Dárda. DEAK Deák [dea:k]. The name is the archaic form of the current diák 'student'. It is a contracted version of the Greek diakonos 'servant, messenger'. The word was used in the Hungarian culture for a 'learned person' or 'one who pursued knowledge'. A deák was treated differently from other servants in the courts of the nobility for his ability to do work in an office. Probably it should be of interest to note that dêkû meant 'officer' in the Akkadian language. Old Hungarian spelling: 1337 -dyak; 1342 Dyak; 1402 Deeak; 1414 Deak-; 1418 Deak; 1643 deák-. DEBRECENI Debreceni [debretseni]. Also spelled Debreczeni and Debreczeny. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates geographic origin, i.e. 'one from Debrecen', a city in Hajdú-Bihar County. Debrecen is located in the vicinity of other places whose names originated in the Turkic languages. It is therefore axiomatic that this name is derived from the city's Turkish founder Dëbrësin which means 'one who lives or moves' (Németh 1990: 280). Old spelling of Debrecen: 1235 Debrezun. DER Dér [de:r]. Also spelled Deér. 'Frost'. A name given to a graying or white haired person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1234 Dera; 1291 der-. DERUS Derűs [dery:sh]. 'Cheerful'. The adjectival suffix -űs is added to der, a root from which derít 'to clear, to purify', derűlt 'clear', derül 'clear up' are derived. The word conveys the meaning of ‘pure’ in a sense of being free of contaminants. This would make it cognate with the Sumerian dúru 'pure' (Labat 1948: No. 536). DESI Dési [de:shi]. Also spelled Désy. 'One who came from Dés' a city in SzolnokDoboka County of historical Hungary indicated by the derivational suffix -i. This area has been confined to Romania in 1920 and the city's name was changed to Dej. The toponym has no meaning in the Hungarian language. Its origin has two possibilities. One is the Latin deus 'god' (Kiss 1978: 178). The other is the Sumerian diš 'one', pronounced as ištên [ishten] by the Akkadians (Labat 1948: No. 480). Considering that the Hungarian word for 'god' is isten [ishten], the Sumerian diš may mean 'the only one', a reference to god. The Church is called egyház in Hungary, compounded from egy 'one' and ház 'house'. Both the Latin and Sumerian etymologies point in the same direction. See Istenes and Dicsházi for additional information. Old Hungarian spelling of Dés: 1184 Des; 1211 Deus; 1214 Dees. DESZKAS Deszkás [deska:sh]. 'A maker or seller of boards and planks'. The name is comprised of deszka 'board, plank' and the adjectival suffix -ás to indicate occupation. The Hungarian deszka is derived either from the Latin discus or the Greek diskos, an internationally shared word which originally meant a 'round plate' in both languages. Similar derivations exist in most European languages. Old Hungarian spelling: 1469 Dezkas; 1636 deszkás.

DICSHAZI Dicsházi [dichha:zi]. ‘From the house of god’. The initial element dics is an archaic root-word in the Hungarian language. All of the meanings derived from it pertain to 'glory, greatness, fame and respect'. For example dicsfény, comprised of dics and fény means 'halo', the radiating light around the head of saints in paintings. The second element ház 'house' is followed by the derivational suffix -i. The fact that most words derived from dics are of religious nature provides a compelling reason to believe that the Hungarian dics was associated with god and holiness in antiquity. Its phonetic value is almost the same as the Sumerian diš [dish] which means 'one' but also means 'continuity' (Labat 1948: No. 480). It was also the sign of the god Anu. If the cuneiform sing is interpreted as the only one that continues and never cease to exist, then we are in the realm of an omnipresent divinity. The cuneiform sign of diš was pronounced ištên [ishten] by the Semitic Akkadians whose language supplanted Sumerian in Mesopotamia and contained numerous Sumerian loan-words. The Akkadian ištên meant 'one' but a phonetically identical word isten [ishten] means 'god' in the Hungarian language. Consequently the interrelation between dics, diš, isten and ištên is axiomatic. This would explain why Hungarians call the Church egyház 'house of one'. It also suggests that the ancestors of Hungarians believed in one god, which would explain why the Unitarian Church has its origin in Transylvania. Transylvania, called Erdély by Hungarians, was integral part of historical Hungary until 1920 when it was confined to Romania. Based on the foregoing information, a conclusion may be drawn that dicsház and egyház mean the same thing: house of god. DIOS Diós [dio:sh]. The name is a composite of dió 'walnut' and the adjectival suffix -ós. It denotes a grower or seller of walnuts. The origin of dió is obscure; probably it is a genuine Magyar word. But according to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language it is a loan-word from the Old Turkic languages, cf. Uighur yangaq (Benkő 1967: 641, vol. 1). This appears to be a rather desperate attempt to provide a solution, but nothing else can be offered to replace it, unless it is accepted as a unique Magyar word. Old Hungarian spelling: 1319 Gyous-; 1338 Gyos-; 1353 Gyas-; 1416 Dyos-; 1423 Dyas; 1430 Dyos; 1602 Diós. DOBA Doba [doba]. The archaic form of the present-day Dobos 'drummer' that retained the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a. DOBOS Dobos [dobosh]. 'Drummer'. The name is derived from dob 'drum' to which the adjectival suffix -os is attached to indicate an occupation. It may also denote a maker or seller of drums. In rural Hungary the town crier's announcement was preceded by a prolonged drumbeat to attract the citizens for the communiqué. In some regions of historical Hungary the town crier was called kisdobos 'one who carries a small drum'. In orchestras, in the military, or anywhere else a drummer was called dobos. The word dob may be a relic from the distant past, judging from the presence of ub3 'drum' (Deimel 1939: No. 256) in the Sumerian language which may be the aphetic form of dub > dob. Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 dobos; 1221 Dubus; 1269 dobus; 1308 Dobus.

DOLGOS Dolgos [dolgosh]. 'Hard working'. The name is derived from dolog 'work, chore' to which the adjectival suffix -os is added to denote character. The Hungarian dolog may be derived from the Sumerian dù 'to create, to build' (Labat 1948: No. 230). Old Hungarian spelling: 1512 Dolgos. DOLMANY Dolmány [dolma:nj]. Derived from the Turkish dolama 'dolman' (Akdikmen 1986: 107), a kind of wide jacket having narrow sleeves. As a garment of the old Turkish military it found its way into many European languages including Hungarian. Old Hungarian spelling: 1504 Dolomaan; 1511 dolman; 1520 dolama; 1530 Dalman. DOMA Doma [doma]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It is probably derived from the Sumerian dumu 'child, descendant' (Labat 1948: No. 144). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Dume. DOMBAI Dombai [dombai]. Also spelled Dombay. The name is comprised of domb 'hill', the archaic adjectival suffix -a and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). It denotes the descendant of a dweller on or by the hill. See Dombi for etymology. DOMBI Dombi [dombi]. Also spelled Domby. Comprised of domb 'hill' and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) the name indicates the descendant of a 'dweller on or by a hill'. The word domb is most likely derived from the Sumerian du6 'hill' (Labat 1948: No. 459). DONATH Dónáth [do:na:t]. Derived from the Latin donatio 'donation, gift', a child whose birth was greatly appreciated by the parents may have received the name. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Donat; 1455 Donath-; 1602 Donát. DONGO Dongó [dongo:]. 'Hummer'. One who talks or sings in a low voice may have been named so. The name incorporates the word dong 'buzz, hum' and the participle -ó that results in an action noun. The word dong may be derived from the Sumerian du11 'to speak, to talk', or du12 'to make music' (Labat 1948: No. 14, 574). The following Hungarian words may also be derived from the same Sumerian words: duma 'patter'; dudol 'hum'; duda 'bagpipe, horn'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1194 Dungou. DOROGI Dorogi [dorogi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates 'one who came from Dorog’ a city in Komárom County. The place name is of Sumerian origin: dúr 'dwelling' and ùg 'people' (Gostony 1975: 145). The compound dúrùg denotes a 'populated dwelling place'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1181 Dorogh; 1249 Durug; 1270 Durugd; 1278 Drug; 1287 Dorogk; 1326 Durugh. DUBA Duba [duba]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It appears to be the compound of the Sumerian dub 'tablet' (Labat 1948: No. 138) and the adjectival suffix -a. It may denote an 'archivist', a keeper of clay tablets. Modern Hungarian equivalent would be táblás. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Duba. DUDA Duda [duda]. A probable derivation from the Sumerian du12 'to make music' (Labat 1948: No. 574). The word-final element -a is the Sumerian and old Hungarian adjectival suffix. The second d is a connecting consonant. Duda means 'bagpipe, horn' and probably a maker or player of bagpipes was named so.

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 Duda. DUDAS Dudás [duda:sh]. 'Piper'. The adjectival suffix -ás indicates an occupation. See Duda for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1494 dwdas. DUHA Duha [duha]. The name appears to be an unaltered original Sumerian appellation. The element duh corresponds with the Sumerian duh 'abundance' (Labat 1948: No. 167), and the word-final element -a is the Sumerian (and archaic Hungarian) adjectival suffix that indicates condition. As a name Duha means 'rich, wealthy'. The Sumerian cuneiform sign for duh is also pronounced as du8, see below. DUS Dús [du:sh]. The present-day Hungarian adjectival suffix -s is added to the Sumerian du8 'abundance' to denote a rich person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1519 Dws. DUH Düh [dyh]. The Hungarian düh 'hot temper, fury' is almost identical with the Sumerian dih 'excited, feverish' (Labat 1948: No. 138). A temperamental person may have acquired such a name. Old Hungarian spelling: 1251 Duh-; 1456 dÿh-; 1493 dwh-; 1517 gyh-; 1550 deoh-; 1831 düh-. EBER Éber [e:ber]. The name denotes an 'alert, vigilant' person. The word éber was first recorded as ewbrewn 'awake' in 1372 (Benkő 1967: 704, vol. 1). A vigilant person may have been named so. The word éber, ébren is present only in the Hungarian language but may be connected with the Sumerian bar which has 'to open' as one of its meanings (Deimel 1939: No. 49). EBES Ebes [ebesh]. A dweller by the 'bog' or 'swamp' may have been named so. Ebes means 'bog, swamp' in the Hungarian language (B. Lőrinczy 1988: 8). The root eb in the name is not related to eb 'dog'. Ebes was first recorded as a place name in 1067 and as a surname Ebus in 1138. ECSEDY Ecsedy [echedi]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from Ecséd, the name of a village in Heves County, spelled Eched in 1332 (Kiss 1978: 196). The name is derived from öcs 'younger brother' (archaic spelling ecs). The personal name directly derived from ecs was recorded in 1067 as Heche and Ichy (Benkő 1967: 20, vol. 3). Öcs is shared with other Finno-Ugric languages where it denotes both younger brother and sister. The reconstructed proto-word is *ećɜ. ED Ed [ed]. The surname Ed is from the root of édes 'sweet'. See below. EDE Ede [ede]. The word-final element -e is the archaic Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a changed to -e by vowel harmony. The name is the equivalent of the present-day édes 'sweet'. See below. The German source Edward, listed in the Book of Hungarian Forenames (Ladó 1978: 152) is doubtful. The name Ede was first recorded in the 5th century by Greek chronicler Priscos Rhetor as Edekon, the name of a nobleman in the court of Attila, king of the Huns. That name is an obvious compound of the actual name Ede and khan (Hallay 1986: 11) a title used mainly for a subordinate ruler in most pre-thirteen-century Turkic languages (Clauson 1972: 630). EDES Édes [e:desh]. The word édes has three meanings: sweet, pleasant and dear. It is a



32
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
composite of the root éd and the adjectival suffix -es. Édes is a variant of ízes 'tasty', derived from íz 'taste', an Uralic word meaning 'odor, smell'. The reconstructed Uralic proto-word is *ipse (Benkő 1967: 250, vol. 2). The name may have been bestowed on a person for having pleasant manners. Old Hungarian spellings: 1138 Edus; 1300 ezes; 1805 ides. EGERI Egeri [egeri]. Also spelled Egery, Egri, Egry. The derivational suffix -i (archaic y) signifies a person from Eger, a city in Heves County. Most Hungarian publications list éger 'alder tree' as source of the toponym Eger (Kiss 1978: 197). The city is located by the Eger river, listed as Egur in documents as early as 1009 (Györffy 1987: 80, vol. 3). The bishopric, named after St. John, already existed at that time in the same place where the city is located now. This raises the possibility of Egur being a compound of the Sumerian e 'church' (Labat 1948: 324) and kur 'mountain' (Labat 1948: 364), suggesting that a temple on high ground near the river gave impetus to the name. EGETO Égető [e:getø:]. 'Burner'. The name contains the root ég 'to burn', the causative suffix -et and the participle -ő. The name may be the archaic equivalent of the presentday fűtő 'stoker'. Old Hungarian spelling was Egueteu in 1211. According to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language ég is probably of Finno-Ugric origin. EGYED Egyed [edjed]. Derived from egy 'one', it may have been given to an only child. Old Hungarian spellings in 1138 were Egud, Egyd, Eguid, Egyig, Egig, Egiud, Egyud, Aegyd, Hegud. EGYENES Egyenes [edjenesh]. The name depicts a 'straight, forward' individual. It includes egyen ‘straight’ and the adjectival suffix -es. Egyen is probably a variant of the Sumerian edin 'plain, flat, steppe' (Labat 1948: No. 168), the gy being the palatal counterpart of the alveolar d. The adjectival suffix -es indicates character and condition. Old Hungarian spelling was igyenes in 1372. EKES Ékes [e:kesh]. 'Ornate, bejeweled'. The name may be a derivation from ék 'wedge' to which the adjectival suffix -es is added to indicate condition. The only way this line of reasoning can be sustained is if we assume that jewels and ornaments were shaped like wedges in early Hungarian society. A person or an object decorated with wedge shaped elements would then be called ékes. Old Hungarian spellings: 1213 Ecus; 1372 ekes; 1490 ykes. ELEK Elek [elek]. This name is a relic from the distant past. It was recorded in the form of Elac by Jordanes, a sixth century Gothic (Alan) historian as the name of one of Attila's sons. Attila was king of the Huns in the fifth century. Hungarian records spell it Ellák. Both the Hun Elac, Ellák and the present-day Hungarian Elek show relevance to the Turkish ilk 'first'. Probably Attila's first born son was named so and the tradition continued in Hungarian naming customs. ELEMER Elemér [eleme:r]. A probable derivation from the Turkish il 'province' and mir 'chief'. ELOD Előd [elø:d]. The name signifies a 'predecessor, ancestor' in the Hungarian language. Recorded in 1150 as Eleud. It may also signify a military commander who leads his troops into battle.



33
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
ELES Éles [e:lesh]. 'Sharp'. A 'keen, smart' person may have been named so. It is comprised of the word él 'edge' and the adjectival suffix -es. The word él may be of Ugric origin. The reconstructed proto-word is listed as *elɜ (Benkő 1967: 737, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spellings: 1138 Elus; 1585 éles. ELLEN Ellen [elen]. Appears to be a tag-name denoting a disagreeable person. The word ellen means 'against, in opposition to' in the Hungarian language. The word was recorded as ellen in 1372. ELO Élő [e:lø:]. 'Living'. The word él 'live' is derived from the Uralic languages in which one of the meanings is 'to recuperate' in addition to 'live, living, existing' and 'reside'. Consequently the Hungarian élő, which is a composite of él and the participle -ő, refers to a person who had recovered from a serious illness. The reconstructed Uralic proto-form is *elä (Benkő 1967: 737, vol. 1). EMBER Ember [ember]. 'Man, human being'. A name given for no obvious reason. The two possible constituents of the name are em, as in emse and eme 'female, woman' and ber 'male'. Old Hungarian spelling was ember in 1195. Another possible etymology would be the Sumerian en-bar 'man' (Gostony 1975: 29). EMESE Emese [emeshe]. A probable derivation from the Sumerian geme-še 'femaleseed'. Another phonetic value of the cuneiform sign for geme is sila which is phonetically analogous with the Hungarian szülő 'one who gives birth' (Labat 1948: No. 59, 60). Also compare with Sumerian emé 'guardian of the infant' (Labat 1948: No. 315). Similar words are in the Uralic languages, cf. Finn emä 'female, mother', Estonian ema 'mother'. The reconstructed Uralic proto-word may be *emä (Benkő 1967: 764, vol.1). The Mongolian eme ‘female’ should also be considered as cognate (Golden 2000: 204, 259). The present-day Hungarian perception of Emese is 'anyácska' that translates as the endearing form of anya 'mother' (Ladó 1968: 44). Old Hungarian spellings: 1150 Emesu; 1211 Emse. ENEH Enéh [ene:]. The name is believed to be the archaic spelling of the present-day ünő 'heifer', a totemistic animal of ancient Hungarians, recorded by Simon Kézai, chronicler of king László (1262-1290). Ine, Enee, Enech, Eneth are the various other forms in old Hungarian chronicles. The mythical Eneh was the mother of Magor, the legendary progenitor of Magyars. The word ünő is of Old Turkic origin, cf. Chagatai and Kipchak inäk, Osmanli inek, Yakut inah, all of which mean 'cow' (Benkő 1967: 1053, vol. 3). ENEKES Énekes [e:nekesh]. 'Singer'. It is a hybrid name incorporating the Sumerian é 'to speak' (Labat 1948: No. 308), the element nok, affected by vowel harmony, which indicates occupation and the adjectival suffix -es. Similar words are in the Finno-Ugric languages, cf. Finn ääni 'sound, voice'. The Finno-Ugric proto-word may have been *äne. Old Hungarian spellings: 1277 Enekus; 1560 enekes. ENGI Engi [engi]. The name may be derived from the Sumerian en-gi 'lord of the reed' (Labat 1948: No. 85, 99) that is the ‘wet-land’. It has no meaning in present-day Hungarian. The Sumerians called their country ki-en-gi 'country of the lord of the reeds' (Roux 1976: 82). Another interpretation of ki-en-gi is ‘land dominated by reeds’, e.g. overgrown by reeds. EPER Eper [eper]. The name may have been bestowed on a berry farmer. The Hungarian



34
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
eper 'berry' is akin to other Ugric words of the same kind, cf. Vogul äprä 'strawberry' (Benkő 1967: 774, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spellings: 1075 Haper-; 1405 Eper-; 1595 epergy. EPERJESSY Eperjessy [eperjeshi]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from Eperjes, the name of a city in Sáros County of historical Hungary. The city was confined to Slovakia on June 4, 1920 by the Trianon Peace Treaty and renamed Prešov. The place name Eperjes incorporates the word eper 'berry', the connecting consonant j and the adjectival suffix -es. The city may take its name from the wild berries which grew abundantly in the area. The reduplication of s (ss) marks a stressed consonant. See Eper for etymology. Old Hungarian spellings: 1075 Haperies; 1230 Apries; 1233 Epuryes; 1252 Epyries; 1793 eperjesi. EPLENYI Eplényi [eple:nji]. The derivational suffix -i denotes a person from Eplény, the name of a settlement which amalgamated with Olaszfalu, in Veszprém County. The word eplény is of Slavonic origin, cf. oplin, oplen 'crosstie on a sleigh' (Benkő 1967: 777, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spellings: 1395 eplen; 1475 epleen; 1792 Eplény. EPRES Epres [epresh]. 'Grower or seller of berries'. See Eper for more information. EPP Epp [ep]. Archaic form of ép 'intact, healthy'. The secondary meaning épület 'building' may be associated with the Sumerian e2 'house' (Labat 1948: No. 324). However, the name Epp most likely denotes a healthy person. Old Hungarian spelling was epp- in 1372. ERDI Érdi [e:rdi]. Also spelled Érdy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Érd, the name of a place in Pest County. Érd is comprised of ér 'brook' and the suffix -d which denotes a place. The name suggests a settlement by a brook. Old Hungarian spelling was Erdu in 1240. ERDEI Erdei [erdei]. The name denotes a dweller in or by the erdő 'forest'. The derivational suffix -i indicates geographical origin. The word erdő may be a derivation from the verb ered 'originate', which is derived from the Uralic *šärɜ- 'stretch, expand, enlarge', according to the HistoricalEtymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language. With all of its attraction, however, the Uralic etymology may not be correct. The concepts of 'originate' and 'expend' do not have any relationship with a wooded area like a forest. But there is yet another possibility, one which is phonetically and semantically more convincing. The original Hungarian word for forest, which became obsolete a long time ago, may have been derived from fa 'wood, tree', like the Turkish orman which means both 'wood' and 'forest'. Other examples are the French bois 'wood' and les bois 'forest and the English wood from which woods 'forest' is derived. The suggested interpretation for the earliest Hungarian word for forest is based on deductive reasoning that the element fajd in the Hungarian name fajdkakas 'woodcock, grouse' cannot be anything else but an early rendering of 'woods, forest'. The word fajd contains the element fa 'tree, wood'. The rest of the word is difficult to etymologize. A regional dialect is fájityúk 'woodhen' (B. Lőrinczy 1988: 254, vol. 2) provides a much closer evidence for fáji being 'of the woods'. The fa segment certainly stands for 'forest',



35
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
the j is a connecting consonant and the -i is the derivational suffix. Similar words that exist in the Celtic languages would substantiate the rational in this argument, cf. old Irish fid 'tree, wood' and Welsh ffawydden 'beech trees' (Thorne 1994: 85). See Erdély for more information. However, erdő means 'forest' in present-day Hungarian, therefore the meaning of Erdei is interpreted accordingly, but it may mean Erdélyi as reasoned below. Old Hungarian spellings: 1138 Erdeidi; 1320 Erdey; 1490 erdei. ERDELY Erdély [erde:j]. This surname may have been inspired by the toponym Erdély, the Hungarian name of Transylvania, a region of historical Hungary until June 4, 1920 when the Treaty of Trianon confined it to Romania. A difficult name to interpret and subject of debate among Hungarian onomasticians. Linguists associate it with the word erdő 'forest, woodland' which, according to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, is derived from ered 'originate' and is synonymous with sarjad 'sprout, shoot-up' (Benkő 1967: 782, vol. 1). The association of these two words with grown trees of a forest seems to cause the problem. There is no doubt erdő means 'forest' in present-day Hungarian, but it is doubtful Erdély is derived from it. It is also doubtful that a forest was called erdő in ancient Hungarian because it does not contain the word fa ‘wood’. For example fás ‘timbered, covered with trees’ would be more appropriate. Furthermore, the name fa was equally used for ‘wood’ and ‘forest’ in 1231 and faas meant ‘covered by trees’ in 1519 (Benkő 1967: 822, vol. 1). The old school of Onomastics maintains that the name Erdeuelu and Erdewelu, as recorded in Latin texts, was the old Hungarian equivalent of the Latin Transylvania 'land beyond the forest'. The entire world, including Hungary, is full of forests and a name like that can be applied to any area, rendering such a name ineffective. The last element elu was associated with the Ugric *älɜ 'beyond' (Benkő 1967: 757, vol. 1), notwithstanding a close resemblance to the Hungarian elő 'before'. The primary meaning of the Latin transis 'across, through'; 'being beyond' is secondary. Consequently the Latin trans-sylvania may be interpreted as 'extending across the forest', i.e. the entire forested area. It is now necessary to make an important assumption, which is that Erdély was originally called Eredély and it denoted the place of origin of the Magyar people. This would also mean that the Magyar speaking Székelys are the indigenous population of Transylvania. As a toponym Erdély marks the original homeland of the Magyars. The e in the middle of the name was omitted by syncopation, a grammatical process that involves the deletion of a vowel within a word, cf. Hungarian cukor 'sugar' > cukros 'sugary, sweet' (instead of cukoros). The word-final element -ély is a suffix that forms nouns from verbs, cf. enged 'to permit' > engedély 'permission, license'. Compare with Erdei. ERDELYI Erdélyi [erde:ji]. The derivational suffix -i denotes a person from Erdély 'Transylvania'. See Erdely for etymology. ERDESZ Erdész [erde:s]. 'Forest-ranger', comprised of erdő 'forest' and the formative suffix -ész. The word erdész is a recent development; it did not surface in literature until 1807. The old Hungarian name for forest-ranger was either erdő-óvó 'forest-protector' spelled erdewow in 1300, or erdő-örző 'forest-guard' spelled erdewewryzew in 1489 (Szamota 1902-1906: 195, 196).

ERDOS Erdős [erdø:sh]. Another old name for erdész 'forest-ranger'. The name contains erdő 'forest' and the adjectival suffix -ős which denotes an occupation. Old Hungarian spelling was Erdeus in 1202. ERDOSI Erdősi [erdø:shi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant os Erdős 'forest-ranger'. See above for more explanation. EREKY Ereky [ereki]. This name is difficult to etymologize unless it is derived from the Sumerian Erech, the name of a city in ancient Mesopotamia. The archaic derivational suffix -y denotes a person from Erek, a probable variant of Erech. The phonetic values of both names are similar to the Hungarian örök 'eternal' and the Turkic ürük 'long-lasting' (Benkő 1967: 35, vol. 3). Probably Erech was the 'eternal city' for the Sumerians, the same as Rome is for Christians. ERES Eres [eresh]. The adjectival suffix -es is appended to ér 'vein' to suggest a person with bulging veins. The word ér is present in other Finno-Ugric languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *särɜ (Benkő 1967: 779, vol.1). Old Hungarian spelling was Eres in 1522. Another possible source of origin is the Hungarian erős 'strong', which is a derivation from the Sumerian er3, ir3 'strong' (Deimel 1939: No. 28). Similar words are in the Turkic languages, cf. Uighur ärk 'strong' (Benkő 1967: 790, vol. 1). It may be of importance that Ereš [eresh] was also the name of a Sumerian deity. ERI Éri [e:ri]. Also spelled Éry. The name appears to be a relic from the distant past. It is identical with the Sumerian èri 'servant, slave' (Labat 1948: No. 50). ERODY Erődy [erø:di]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a dweller in or by the erőd 'fortress', which is derived from erő 'strength'. See Eres for more detail. EROS Erős [erø:sh]. 'Strong'. See Eres above for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling was Ereus in 1211. ERSEK Érsek [e:rshek]. 'Archbishop'. Also used as an epithet for a pompous, know-it-all person. It is derived from the initial element of the Greek arhie(piskop) 'chief(bishop)’. Old Hungarian spelling was Ersek in 1211. ERSZENY Erszény [erse:nj]. The name of an unidentified Turkic people, recorded as Tokuz Ersen 'Nine Ersen' on a monument erected around AD 720 on the bank of the Tola creek, a tributary of the Orkhon River in Mongolia (Györffy 1975: 59, 275). There is no correlation between the name and the Hungarian erszény 'purse'. ESSO Esső [esø:]. The participle -ő is suffixed to the element es ‘to fall’ to form an adjective from a verb. The reduplicated s (ss) marks a stressed consonant. The Hungarian eső 'rain' is a probable derivation from the Uralic *ećɜ 'let, abandon, drop' (Benkő 1967:795, vol.1). The Sumerian eš10 'water' (Labat 1948: No. 579) may also be considered. Associating it with water instead of falling water is a possibility. The regular Sumerian word for water is a (Labat 1948: No. 578). Old Hungarian spelling was Esu in 1138. ESTEY Estey [eshtei]. Also spelled Estey. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a relationship with este 'evening'. Probably one born in the evening was named so. The word este is short for napeste 'sundown' derived from esik 'fall, drop'. It may originate in the Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *ećɜ. The old Hungarian spelling was estue in 1372. See Esso for more detail.

ESZENYI Eszényi [ese:nji]. The derivational suffix -i denotes a person from Eszény, a town in historical Hungary's Szabolcs County. It is in an area confined to the Ukraine after World War II and was renamed Javorovo. Eszényi is one of those obscure names that resist all attempts to resolve its etymology. Slavonic origin can be ruled out with certainty for the name was Slavonicized after annexation. Old Hungarian spelling of the place name was Ezen in 1274. ESZES Eszes [esesh]. The adjectival suffix -es is attached to ész 'reason, sense' to denote a smart person. Similar words are in the Turkic languages, cf. Kirghiz äs, Baskir is 'reason, sense' (Benkő 1967: 798, vol. 1). However, the ultimate origin of the word may be the Sumerian uš4 'reason, sense' (Labat 1948: No. 534). Also compare with Osmanli us 'intelligence, state of mind' (Akdikmen 1986: 358). Old Hungarian spelling: 1389 Ezus; 1391 Ezzes; 1466 Ezes. ETE Ete [ete]. An ancient Hungarian name, first recorded around the turn of the First Millennium AD. Ete son of chieftain Ond is credited with the construction of a fortress at the city of Csongrád (Györffy 1987: 882, vol. 1). The name is of Turkic origin. Old Hungarian spelling was Ete in 1138. EVADY Évady [e:vadi]. A name of uncertain derivation. Évad means 'season' in the Hungarian language and its origin cannot be traced to any other tongue. Old Hungarian spelling: 1519 ewad-, evad, évad, ivad. EVEZOS Evezős [evezø:sh]. 'Rower'. Comprised of the root evez 'to row', the participle ő (evező also means 'paddle') and the adjectival suffix -s. The name denotes an occupation. A possible derivation from the Finno-Ugric *evä 'paddle, fin' (Benkő 1967: 814, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling: 1395 ewezo; 1604 evozos. EZELLO Ézellő [e:zellø:]. Archaic spelling of ízelő 'food-taster'. The name is comprised of íz 'taste', the third person singular -el and the participle -ő. The name denotes an occupation, a food-taster in a nobleman's court. Variants of íz are present in the Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *ipse 'smell, taste' (Benkő 1967: 250, vol. 2). FABRI Fábri [fa:bri]. Also spelled Fábry. Derived from the Latin faber 'craftsman' to which the Hungarian patronymic suffix -i (archaic -y) is attached to denote a descendant of a craftsman. The middle e was omitted by syncopation. The Hungarian verb fabrikál 'piece something together, repair' is derived from the same root. Old Hungarian spelling was Faber in 1138. FAGYAS Fagyas [fadjash]. An old form of the present-day faggyús 'suet, mutton-fat merchant, candle maker'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1374 fagyas-; 1413 fagyas. FAHIDY Fahidy [fahidi]. 'Dweller by the wooden bridge', comprised of fa 'wood', híd 'bridge' and the archaic derivational suffix -y. FAKLYAS Fáklyás [fa:kja:sh]. 'Torch bearer', derived from fákja 'torch' plus the adjectival suffix -ás that indicates possession and provision in this case. The Hungarian fákja is a derivative of the Latin facula 'torch'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1416 facl'a-; 1532 fakla-; 1585 fáklya. FALU Falu [falu]. The word falu 'village' has no probable reason to form a surname. Falu shows phonetic and semantic relation with âlu 'village' (Labat 1948: No. 43) the



38
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Akkadian equivalent of the Sumerian uru (Labat 1948: No. 38). It may be a Sumerian loan word in the Akkadian language. Also compare the Sumerian gišbulug and Akkadian palukku 'reed settlement' (Labat 1948: No. 96). Palukku's phonetic value is similar to the Hungarian palánk 'boardfence' erected for protecting a settlement. Similar words exist in the Ugric and Finno-Ugric languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *palyɜ (Benkő 1967: 836, vol. 1). Cf. English palisade ‘stake-fence’, derived from the Latin palus ‘stake’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1075 falu; 1176 falwa; 1214 foloud; 1230 folu; 1378 falow. FALUSI Falusi [falushi]. Also spelled Falussy. The name is comprised of falu 'village', the adjectival suffix -s and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). The name indicates a 'villager'. See Falu for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1410 falusy; 1590 Falusi. FALVY Falvy [falvi]. A different form of Falusi 'villager'. FANCSALI Fancsali [fanchali]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Fancsal, a locality in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. The name's etymology is obscure; its origin from fancsal 'gloomy look, wry smile' may be possible. Old Hungarian spelling: 1262 Fonchal; 1810 Fandsali. FARADY Farády [fara:di]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from Farád, a locality in Győr-Sopron County. The place name Farád is comprised of far 'backside, behind, rump' and the grammatical designator -ád which denotes a place. It presumably describes an agricultural area in a hindmost location. The word far is present in the Uralic languages, for example Udmurt (Votyak) ber 'backside, rump', Finnish perä 'backside' (Benkő 1967: 841, vol. 1), but the ultimate source may be the Sumerian bar 'the back of an anthropoid ape' (Deimel 1939: 49). The concept and reference to an 'anthropoid ape' by Deimel is unclear. FARAGO Faragó [farago:]. 'Carver'. Derived from farag 'to carve' to which the participle -ó is suffixed to denote an occupation. The root element far is present in other Ugric languages, the reconstructed primary form is *parɜ (Benkő 1967: 842, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling was Farago in 1357. FARKAS Farkas [farkash]. 'Wolf'. The designation farkas literally means 'one who has a tail'. It is derived from farok 'tail' which in turn is derived from far 'behind, rump'. The adjectival suffix -as is added to indicate condition. The word originates from the Uralic *purɜ 'turn around, background' according to the Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language. But having a tail is not a suitable name because most animals have tails, it does not distinguish wolfs from other beasts. Wolfs move around in packs. Therefore an alternate origin may be the Hungarian falkás 'a pack of animals' derived from falka 'pack, flock'. Considering that the wolf is also called ordas in the Hungarian language and the Turkish ordu means 'crowd, horde', the derivation from falka seems more relevant. Old Hungarian spellings in 1138 were Farkas, Farcas, Forcos, Forcus, Forcas. FATRAY Fátray [fa:trai]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from the Fátra Mountain Range in the Highlands of historical Hungary. This area was confined to



39
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Slovakia by the Trianon Peace Treaty on June 4, 1920. Fátra is derived from the German Vater 'father'. Saxon immigrants may have given the name in the 12th Century (Kiss 1978: 443). Old Hungarian spelling was fatra in 1284. FAZEK Fazék [faze:k]. The Hungarian fazék 'pot' may be an early designation for the present-day fazekas 'potter'. Fazék seems to be a derivation from the Hungarian főz 'to cook' to which the frequentative suffix -ik is affixed to indicate continuous action. The original főzik may have been distorted to fazék. The Finno-Ugric origin from *pata 'pot' may also be considered (Benkő 1967: 854, vol. 1).
Old Hungarian spellings: 1296 Fazek; 1395 fazek; 1816 fëzëk-. FAZEKAS Fazekas [fazekash]. The name Fazekas 'potter' is comprised of the word fazék 'pot' and the adjectival suffix -as that denotes an occupation. See Fazek for more information. Old Hungarian spellings: 1348 Fazekas; 1370 Fazakas; 1410 Fazokas. FECSER Fecser [fecher]. An obsolete variant of fecsegő 'babling, chatty'. FECSKE Fecske [fechke]. 'Swallow'. A name of onomatopoeic origin, the sound of a swallow articulated by a human. A probable derivation from fecseg, fecsgő 'babbling, chatty' which resembles the chirping sound of European swallows. Old Hungarian spellings: 1333 Fecske-; 1372 fecske-; 1377 Fychke; 1395 fechke; 1864 fecske. FEGYVERES Fegyveres [fedjveresh]. The name denotes a 'weapon dealer' or 'an armed person'. It is comprised of fegyver 'weapon' and the adjectival suffix -es that indicates an occupation or condition. The word fegyver may be a compound of fegy 'rigor, regimen' and ver 'strike, hit'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1211 Feguueres; 1372 fegyueres. FEGYVERNEKY Fegyverneky [fedjverneki]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a descendant of fegyvernek, a variant of fegyvernök 'armor-bearer'. See Fegyveres for more explanation. Old Hungarian spelling was Fegyuernuch in 1213. FEHER Fehér [fehe:r]. 'White'. A name probably given to a person for having white hair or light complexion. Old Hungarian spellings: 1055 feher; 1075 feir-; 1193 Faer-; 1219 Feier. FEHERVARY Fehérváry [fehe:rva:ri]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a dweller in or by the fehér vár 'white fort'. Old Hungarian spelling was feheruuar- in 1055. FEJA Féja [fe:ja]. The old form of the present-day fejős, fejő 'a milker'. The name incorporates fej 'to milk' and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a to denote an occupation. Old Hungarian spelling was feÿe in 1395. FEJER Fejér [feje:r]. May be a variant of Fehér 'white'. See Feher for more detail. An alternative etymology would link fejér with fej ‘head’ and er Finno-Ugric for ‘male’, cf. Turkish er ‘male, man’, denoting a ‘chieftain, superior’. The title fejedelem is also derived from fej ‘head’. See Fejes for more explanation. FEJES Fejes [fejesh]. The epithet fejes is used for denoting a stubborn, headstrong



40
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
person. In some regions of Hungary a supervisor is also called fejes. The name incorporates the word fej 'head' and the adjectival suffix -es to indicate character and status. Variants of fej are present in other Finno-Ugric languages, cf. Finnish pää 'head', but the ultimate origin of the word may be the Sumerian pa 'head, chief' (Deimel 1939: No. 169). The Hungarian fő is a variant of fej and főnök 'head, chief' is derived from it. Old Hungarian spellings: 1002 few; 1055 feu; 1158 fey; 1268 -fw; 1372 -fe; 1378 fő; 1469 fees. FEJOS Fejős [fejø:sh]. 'A milker'. See Feja for more explanation. Old Hungarian spelling was feyws in 1551. FEJSZES Fejszés [fejse:sh]. 'Maker of axes’ or 'one equipped with an axe'. The name contains fejsze 'axe' and the adjectival suffix -es to indicate occupation. Old Hungarian spelling of fejsze: 1395 feÿsse; 1519 feyzy; 1863 féjszi; 1894 fejszë. FEJTO Fejtő [fejtø:]. 'Hewer, cutter' in a mine or quarry. The name is comprised of fejt 'strip, hack' and the participle -ő denoting an occupation. Old Hungarian spelling of fejt: 1372 feyt-. FEKETE Fekete [fekete]. 'Black'. The name may have been bestowed on a black-haired person. It is also possible that the name marked a member of the Black Hungarians. Ancient chronicles mention the Black and White Hungarians without reference to the source of their names. Since the Huns and Hungarians, but not the indigenous Magyars, were of Turkic origin, the two colors may denote Northern (Black) and Southern (White) Hungarians. According to Turkish folklore Black (dark) represents north and White (light) symbolizes south. Thus, they call the Black Sea Karadeniz because it is north of Turkey and the Aegean Sea Akdeniz (White Sea) for its southern location. The Ugric origin of fekete, suggested by the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, is not convincing. Cf. Ostyak (Khanty) puti 'black' (Benkő 1967: 867, vol. 1).
Old Hungarian spellings were Fekete, Feketeu, Feketeh, Fequete in 1138. FEL Fél [fe:l]. A timid, easily frightened person may have been named so. The Hungarian fél 'fear, fright' is cognate with other Uralic words of the same category. The reconstructed Uralic proto-word is *pele 'fear' (Benkő 1967: 870, vol 1). Old Hungarian spellings: 1135 fele; 1138 Feles; 1490 fyl. FELLEGI Fellegi [felegi]. A fictional name suggesting the bearer of the name is from the clouds. The Hungarian language has two words for cloud: felleg and felhő. Both words describe the physical activity required for the formation of clouds. The initial element fel 'up' describes the direction of the lég 'air' and hő 'heat' as they ascend to the height where the condensation into a cloud takes place. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language assigns both felhő and felleg to Finno-Ugric origin. The reconstructed proto-word is *pilβe. Cf. Finnish pilvi 'cloud', Udmurt piv 'cloud'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1493 felhő, felleg-, 1572 fellÿegh. FENYES Fényes [fe:njesh]. 'Shining, bright'. The name may indicate a 'rich, well-to-do' person. Only rich people could afford to burn more than one candle in their homes in olden times. Their houses were brightly lit at night. Those people may have acquired the



41
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
name Fényes 'bright'. Fényes is derived from fény 'light' to which the adjectival suffix -es is appended to denote condition and quality. Old Hungarian spellings: 1075 fen-; 1093 Fen; 1222 Fenies; 1237 Fenyes. FENYI Fényi [fe:nji]. Descendent of Fény 'light' as indicated by the derivational suffix -i. See Fenyes above for more information. FERGE Ferge [ferge]. A variant of fürge 'agile, quick'. It was spelled Fergued in 1221 and Fürge in 1693. FESUS Fésűs [fe:shy:sh]. An occupational name denoting a 'comb-maker' or 'seller of combs'. The adjectival suffix -s is attached to fésű 'comb' to indicate an occupation. The word fésű is comprised of the root fes (as in feslik) 'separate, unfold' and the participle -ű. Fes(-lik) can be traced to the Ugric or Finno-Ugric proto-word *päčɜ 'part, split' (Benkő 1967: 896-897, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spellings: 1400 Feuses; 1463 Fesus. FESZI Fészi [fe:si]. May be a derivation from fészek ‘nest, home’, or feszeng ‘fidget, be restless’. The derivational suffix -i would indicate a person from the fészek, i.e. from home. FICZERE Ficzere [fitsere]. ‘Fancy’. The name of a person who likes to be decked out with adornments. It is difficult to explain its exact meaning in the English language. Old Hungarian spelling was ficzere in 1584. FILE File [file]. A variant of Füle, the archaic form of the present-day Füles 'one having big ears'. The name contains the word fil (>fül) 'ear' and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -e (a variant of -a, modified by vowel harmony). The Hungarian fil, fül is cognate with the Vogul (Mansi) pil 'ear', Udmurt (Votyak) pel 'ear' and other similar words in the Uralic languages (Benkő 1967: 933, vol. 1). However, the ultimate source may be the Sumerian pi 'ear' (Deimel 1939: No. 170). FINTA Finta [finta]. 'Pug-nosed'. Cognate with fintor 'grimace'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1116 Phinta; 1138 Fintu, Fita. FINTOR Fintor [fintor]. The name indicates a person in the habit of making faces. Cognate with Finta. FITOS Fitos [fitosh]. Also spelled Fitus, 'pug-nosed'. Cognate with Finta. FODOR Fodor [fodor]. A curly-haired individual may have been named so. Fodor means 'curl, frill' in the Hungarian language. Old Hungarian spellings: 1246 Fudur; 1287 Fodor. FOGA Foga [foga]. The name may have been given to a 'jailer', for it contains the verb fog 'to hold' and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a. This suffix was attached to verbs and nouns in antiquity to form adjectives and participles. The name appears to be the archaic form of the present-day Fogó. Though, variants of the Hungarian fog can be found in some of the Uralic languages, the most probable source is the Sumerian pag 'imprison' (Labat 1948: No. 78). The Hungarian fogda 'prison' is also derived from fog. Old Hungarian spelling was Fogou in 1138. FOLDE Földe [følde]. The archaic form of the present-day Földes 'landowner'. It is comprised of föld 'earth, land, top soil' and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -e (a variant of -a, modified by vowel harmony).



42
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spellings: 1130 feld-; 1268 folde; 1302 -fuld; 1456 fed-; 1519 feeld. FOLDES Földes [føldesh]. 'Landowner'. See explanation above. It was spelled feldes in 1193 and Földes in 1511. FONYO Fonyó [fonjo:]. The folksy variant of fonó 'spinner' (in a spinning mill). The participle -ó, attached to fony [fonj] 'spin (make yarn)’, denotes an occupation. The word fon is shared with other Uralic languages, the reconstructed proto-word is *puna- (Benkő 1967:946, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling was Funou in 1244. FORBATH Forbáth [forba:t]. Derived from the obsolete forbátol 'requite like for like' (eye for an eye), a Forbáth is one who behaves like that. The word-final element -h marks the reduced plosiveness of the preceding t. The name was spelled Forbát in 1831. FORGACS Forgács [forga:ch]. 'Wood shavings'. This word has no probable reason to form a surname. The word forgács may either be derived from farag 'carve' or forog 'turn, revolve'. The word-final element ács means 'carpenter' as an independent word, but its function as a suffix is obscure. About a dozen words carry this suffix and their meanings are diverse, cf. korbács 'whip', szakács 'cook'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1336 Furgach; 1337 Forgach; 1339 Fargach; 1792 faragáncs. FORGO Forgó [forgo:]. Derived from forog 'turn, revolve' and the participle -ó, the name may denote a craftsman specialized in making tufts for helmets. Tuft means forgó in the Hungarian language. Old Hungarian spelling was Forgo in 1377. FORRAI Forrai [forai]. Also spelled Forray. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a dweller by a spring well. Forra is the old form of the present-day forrás 'spring well', derived from forr 'boil' (Benkő 1967: 956, vol. 1), a derivative of forog 'whirl swirl, turn', describing the movement of boiling liquid. It is possible that the word forra was used to denote hot springs in antiquity. They are abundant in Hungary. The Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a (present-day -ás) signifies condition. Also compare with forró 'hot'. The Sumerian bùru 'spring well' (Labat 1948: No. 411) has similar phonetic value and identical meaning. FOVENYES Fövényes [føvenjesh]. The adjectival suffix -es is attached to fövény 'sand' to denote an owner or a worker in a sand pit. Fövényes is also an obsolete appellation for a sandy beach. Old Hungarian spellings: 1055 fuegnes; 1193 Fuinnes; 1332 Fuenyes; 1590 föuényes. FOZO Főző [fø:zø:]. 'A cook', comprised of főz 'to cook' and the participle -ó. Similar words exist in the Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *peje 'to boil, to cook' (Benkő 1967: 962, vol. 1). It was spelled Fezew in 1436. FUJTATO Fújtató [fu:jtato:]. An unusual surname, comprised of fúj 'to blow', the causative suffix -tat and the participle -ó. It means 'bellows' and the name may signify an operator of such a contrivance, for example in a traditional black-smith shop. The word fúj ‘blow’ is shared by members of the Uralic language family, cf.



43
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Vogul (Mansi) puw 'to blow' (Benkő 1967: 983, vol. 1). The Uralic words show affiliation with the Sumerian bu 'to blow' (Labat 1948: No. 371), which has similar phonetic form and identical meaning. Old Hungarian spelling was fwthato in 1586. FURO Fúró [fu:ro:]. Comprised of fúr 'to drill, to bore a hole' and the participle -ó. The name Fúró denotes a 'driller'. The reconstructed Uralic form may have been *pura (Benkő 1967: 987, vol. 1), but the Sumerian bùru 'to drill' (Labat 1948: No. 411) should be considered as the ultimate source. Old Hungarian spelling was furu in 1272. FUSI Füsi [fyshi]. Also spelled Füssy. The name suggests a dweller on a grassy tract of land. It incorporates the root fű 'grass', the adjectival suffix -s and the derivational suffix i (archaic -y). The suggested source of fű is the Sumerian ú 'grass' (Labat 1948: No. 318). The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language suggests Uralic origin, the reconstructed proto-word would be *pimɜ (Benkő 1967: 998, vol. 1). GABAI Gabai [gabai]. Also spelled Gabay. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language, except for the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) which indicates a descendant of Gaba. The word gaba means 'chest, breast, bosom' in the Sumerian language (Labat 1948: No. 167) and is phonetically close to the Hungarian kebel 'breast, bosom'. A barrel-chested person or one having a prominent chest may have received such a name. Old Hungarian spelling was Gaba in 1211. GABANYI Gabányi [gaba:nji]. The name denotes a resident of a place called Gabány or a descendant of a person called Gabány. The name contains the Sumerian root gaba 'chest, breast, bosom', the suffix -ány which forms collective nouns from verbs and nouns and the derivational suffix -i. See Gabai for more information. GABOS Gabos [gabosh]. The name is the present-day form of the Sumerian Gaba that has the adjectival suffix -a replaced by its modern equivalent -os. See Gabai for more information. Old Hungarian spelling was Gabus in 1138. GACS Gács [ga:ch]. Also spelled Gách. A surname denoting ethnic origin. It is also the name of a town in Nógrád County, probably named after its one time inhabitants the Ruthenians who were called Gács in old Hungarian. The Ruthenians embarked on a western migration from their original homeland in Galicia during the Thirteenth Century and most of them settled in Máramaros, Bereg, Ung and Zemplén counties of historical Hungary (Ács 1986: 101). Both the people and their country were called Gács by Hungarians, Halicz by the Poles and Galich by the Russians. The etymology of the name is unresolved. GACSI Gácsi [ga:chi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Gács, a town in Nógrád County. See Gács for etymology. GACSO Gacsó [gacho:]. A variant of gacsos 'club-footed'. Spelled Kacsos in 1260 and gacsos in 1700. GADO Gadó [gado:]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It



44
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
may be a variant of the Sumerian gad, gada 'flax, linen' (Labat 1948: No. 90), bestowed either on a flax grower or a weaver of linens. Another word that may have been derived from the Sumerian gada is the Hungarian gatya 'a pair of white wide linen trousers', the traditional garment of men in rural Hungary. Naming a garment or other objects after the material they were made of is practiced by most linguistic communities. For example the English iron is the name of the material of which the heated appliance is made for smoothing dresses. The Hungarian phonetic system allows the change between the speech sounds d [d], ty [tj] and gy [dj] resulting in gaty and gagy. The word-final element -a in the Sumerian gada represented both the adjective and the participle while the suffix -ó is the participle in the Hungarian language and denotes an occupation. GAGYI Gagyi [gadji]. The derivational suffix -i denotes a person from Gagy, a village in Abaúj County, now called Alsógagy 'Lower Gagy'. The place name is derived from the name of its founder. The surname Gagy is cognate with the Sumerian gada 'flax, linen' and may have preserved the occupation of a forebear. See Gado for etymology. Old Hungarian spellings: 1256 Gogy; 1279 Gayg; 1317 Gog; 1332 Gader, God. GAJDOS Gajdos [gajdosh]. 'Piper'. The adjectival suffix -os is added to gajd 'reed pipe' to denote an occupation. Gajd is an international loan word present in the Ural-Altaic and Indo-European languages cf. Osmanli gayda, Arab gaita, Spanish gaita, Polish gajda, all of them meaning ‘pipe’ (Benkő 1967:1013 vol. 1). The probable source of gajd is the compound Sumerian gi 'reed' (Labat 1948: No. 85) and du12 'to make music' (Labat 1948: No. 85). One of the earliest wind instruments was made of reed, abundant in ancient Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). Old Hungarian spellings: 1272 Goydus; 1402 Gaydus. GAL Gál [ga:l]. Also spelled Gáll, Gaál. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It may be a relic from the Sumerian language where gal was the title of a 'great man', it also meant 'noble, majestic, high-class' (Labat 1948: No. 343). Old Hungarian spelling was Gal in 1138. GALAMB Galamb [galamb]. 'Dove, pigeon'. A frequent Hungarian surname given to a peaceful, gentle person. The word galamb is an altered form of the Latin columba 'pigeon'. The Slavonic source of golob, golub or holub, as suggested by the HistoricalEtymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, is not convincing. Old Hungarian spellings: 1138 Glomb-, Glamb; 1165 golomb-; 1316 Galomb; 1372 galamb. GALAMBOS Galambos [galambosh]. The adjectival suffix -os is attached to galamb 'pigeon' to denote a pigeon breeder or fancier. See Galamb for more information. GALANTAI Galántai [gala:ntai]. Also spelled Galántay, Galánthay. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Galánta, a town in historical Hungary, confined to Slovakia in 1920 by the Trianon Peace Treaty. The name Galánta is derived from the French galant 'gallant' which is a derivation from the Teutonic geil 'wanton'. The town's name commemorates the name of its founder. The word-final element -a in Galánta is the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix

denoting character. Originating it from the Czech surname Golata (Kiss 1978: 230) only touches on exactness. Old Hungarian spelling was Galantha in 1237. GALDY Gáldy [ga:ldi]. A resident of Gáld. The name contains the following elements: Sumerian gal, the grammatical designator -d denoting a place, and the archaic derivational suffix -y. See Gal for etymology. GALFI Gálfi [ga:lfi]. Also spelled Gálfy. The patronymic suffix -fi (archaic -fy) signifies a descendant of Gál. See Gal for more information. GALGAI Galgai [galgai]. Also spelled Galgay. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a dweller by the stream Galga. The word galga cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. The only clue to its identity is the word-final element -a that marked both adjectives and participles in Sumerian and ancient Hungarian. The names of many major Hungarian water courses have the Sumero-Hungarian suffix -a and its modern Hungarian equivalent -os and -ó. Cf. Duna, Tisza, Dráva, Száva, Rába, Rábca, Mura, Lajta, Zsitva; Maros, Szamos, Kapos, Kőrös, Temes, Aranyos; Sajó, Csalló, Küküllő. In the case of Galga the suffix -a is preceded by the consonant g, a frequent connecting sound along with -k- in front of the adjective -a. The remaining gal means 'majestic' in the Sumerian language. See Gal for more information. GALI Gáli [ga:li]. A descendant of Gál, indicated by the derivational suffix -i. See Gal for more information. GALLA Galla [gala]. The name may owe its origin to the Sumerian gala 'priest' (Labat 1948: No. 211). GALLAI Gallai [galai]. Also spelled Gallay. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) denotes a descendant of Galla. See above for etymology. GALLO Galló [galo:]. A variant of Galla. GALLYAS Gallyas [gajash]. The name may have been bestowed on the owner or breeder of cattle called gallyas (B. Lőrinczy 1988: 593, vol. 2). They called so for the tip of their long upright horn turning to the side. GAMOS Gamós [gamo:sh]. The name is derived from the Sumerian gam 'to bend, to stoop' (Labat 1948: No. 362) to which the adjectival suffix -ós is appended. One may have been named so because of his posture. GARA Gara [gara]. This name has no meaning in modern Hungarian. It may be derived from the Sumerian gar 'to make, to manufacture' (Deimel 1939: No. 336). Cf. Hungarian gyár ‘factory’, gyárt ‘manufactures’. The adjectival suffix -a denotes a manufacturer or a craftsman. The German gar 'done, quite' is an unlikely source. GARAI Garai [garai]. Also spelled Garay. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Gara. See Gara for more information. GARI Gari [gari]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant of Gar. See Gara for etymology. GARAZDA Garázda [gara:zda]. ‘Rowdy, reckless’. One who is especially generous with other people's possessions. Its etymology is obscure. Old Hungarian spelling was Garazda in 1375.

GARDI Gárdi [ga:rdi]. The derivational suffix -i denotes a person from Gárd, present in the name of two villages in Abaúj County of historical Hungary, confined to Slovakia by the Trianon Peace Treaty in 1920. The name was first recorded as Olgord [Algárd] 'Lower Gárd' in 1280. Felgárd 'Upper Gárd' also existed but both villages were often referred to as Gárd. They both amalgamated with other settlements and their vestige was lost. The name Gárd contains the Sumerian gar 'pose, appearance' (Labat 1948: No. 597). The word gar is not listed in Hungarian dictionaries, only its derivative garral and only examples are given for different meanings in sentences. These examples suggest that the root gar may have had, at one time, a meaning that described the attitude and conduct of a person having abundant self-confidence noticeable in his attitude. One who behaved with much ado. The suffix -d denotes a place. The French garder 'to guard' is an unlikely source. GARZO Garzó [garzo:]. The name has no meaning in modern Hungarian. It may be derived from the Sumerian garza 'religious order' (Labat 1948: No. 295b) implying a person that belonged to such an order. GAYDA Gayda [gajda]. The name means 'bagpipe' in the Turkish language. See Gajdos for more information. GAZDA Gazda [gazda]. 'Farmer, landowner'. It also meant 'head of the family' in archaic Hungarian. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language suggests the Slavonic gospoda 'hotel' as the possible source, but notes that the historical development of gazda cannot be satisfactorily linked to the Slavonic word. The most probable origin is the Sumerian luga-zi-da 'farmer' (Gostony 1975: 76). GECSE Gecse [geche]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It is probably derived from the Turkish geç [gech] 'late, delayed' (as in time). A tardy person may have received such a name. Gecse is also a place name in Veszprém County, named after its founder. Old Hungarian spellings: 1255 Jeche; 1263 Geche; 1270 Gesche; 1306 Gueche; 1309 Getche; 1312 Gechche; 1315 Gerche. GECSEY Gecsey [gechei]. The archaic derivational suffix -y denotes a person from Gecse, a village in Veszprém County. See above for more information. GEMES Gémes [ge:mesh]. The adjectival suffix -es indicates possession of a gém 'the sweep of a lifting mechanism' like a crane. One having a sweep pole well on his property may have received the name Gémes. Another possible origin is the Sumerian geme ‘female’ (Labat 1948: No. 554) to which the adjectival suffix -s is added to indicate a married man. Old Hungarian spelling was Gem- in 1138. GERDE Gérde [ge:rde]. An altered form of gírda 'lean, raw boned'. The following variants have the initial element ger and gir in regional dialects: gerc 'spine'; gérces 'lean (person); gercsa 'spine and ribs together'; gerdó 'lean'; girbic 'lean'; girhes 'lean, raw boned' (B. Lőrinczy 1988: 628, 646, vol. 2). The name Gérde is a probable derivation from the Sumerian gir 'bone' (Labat 1948: No. 10). The surname Csontos 'bony' means the same thing. Csont means 'bone' in present-day Hungarian.

GERENCSER Gerencsér [gerenche:r]. Derived from the Slavonic grnčar 'potter' (Benkő 1967: 1042, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling was Gherencher in 1389. GERENDAS Gerendás [gerenda:sh]. The adjectival suffix -ás indicates a maker or seller of gerenda 'beam, rafter'. Two theories exist as to the origin of gerenda: 1 From the Slavonic *greda 'beam' (Benkő 1967: 1050, vol. 1). 2 A derivative of the Sumerian girinnum 'truss, beam' (Gostony 1975: 77). Old Hungarian spelling was Guerenda in 1331. GESZT Geszt [gest]. A dweller by the geszt 'grove' may have been named so. Geszt is also the name of a locality in Békés County. Old Hungarian spellings: 1213 Gest; 1332 Kezt-. GESZTI Geszti [gesti]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Geszt, a locality in Békés County. See Geszt above. GIDA Gida [gida]. There are two possibilities for the source of this name. The word gida means 'young goat' in the Hungarian language but it has no probable reason to form a surname. The Sumerian gid(-da) 'long' (Labat 1948: 371) may denote a tall person. GIGAS Gigás [giga:sh]. The adjectival suffix -ás denotes a person with a prominent giga 'throat' (Adam's apple). Giga is a regional dialectic form for gége 'throat'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1138 Gegu, Geugu; 1229 Gegus; 1888 giga. GILICE Gilice [gilitse]. The endearing form of gerlice 'turtle-dove', the Hungarian version of the Slavonic grlica, *g'rdlica (Benkő 1967: 1054: vol. 1). Old Hungarian spellings: 1372 gerlicze; 1416 gorlice; 1558 gilice-. GILVESY Gilvesy [gilveshi]. Anglicized form of Gyülvészi. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Gyülvész, an altered form of Gyülevész, a village in Zala County. The place name denotes a location where people assembled for meetings and other purposes. Old Hungarian spellings: 1406 Gelwez; 1475 Gyelwez. GILYAN Gilyán [gija:n]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. The root gil 'to destroy' (Labat 1948: No. 67) is a Sumerian word which may have been given to an antagonistic person. The second element yan may be the Indo-European -ian that forms adjectives. The initial element Gil was a Hungarian name, also recorded as Gyl in 1211 (Fehértói 1983: 148). GINA Gina [gina]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It may be the continuation of the Sumerian gi-na 'steady, stable' (Labat 1948: No. 85). GIRHES Girhes [girhesh]. The epithet girhes is mostly applied to describe a 'lean, raw boned, sickly' person. Its variant Gera is also a surname. The name Girhes may have been given to a thin, raw boned person. The root gir is identical with the Sumerian gir 'bone' (Labat 1948: No. 10) both in meaning and phonetic form. The h that follows the root word is a connecting consonant. The adjectival suffix -es denotes condition. Old Hungarian spellings: 1322 Gurhes; 1505 Gerwhes; 1561 görhes; 1865 girhes. GOBE Góbé [go:be:]. The name of a 'crafty' person in the Transylvanian dialect.



48
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1617 goba-; 1660 góbé-. GOBOLOS Göbölös [gøbøløsh]. The adjectival suffix -ös denotes a person who fattens oxes for human consumption. The Hungarian word for such ox is göböly. Old Hungarian spellings: 1402 Gwbul; 1585 Göböly; 1801 göböl-. GOCH Göch [gøch]. Derivation from the Turkish göç [gøch] 'goods and chattels of migrating people'. Cf. Hungarian gönc. GOCSEI Göcsei [gøchei]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Göcsej 'undulating country', the south-west region of Zala County (B. Lőrinczy 1988: 671, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling was Gőcsey in 1699. GODOR Gödör [gødør}. A dweller by the gödör 'pit' may have received the name. Old Hungarian spellings: 1251 Gudur-; 1254 -gudur; 1367 Gewder; 1385 Geudeur; 1428 Gwder; 1832 ködör; 1833 gődör. GOGOS Gőgös [gø:gøsh]. 'Arrogantly proud'. Derived from gőg 'pride, arrogance' to which the adjectival suffix -ös is added. Old Hungarian spellings: 1219 Gugus; 1224 Guegus; 1377 Gegus; 1456 geges-; 1495 göggös. GOMBOCZ Gömböcz [gømbøts]. A portly person is referred to as gömböc, derived from gömb 'round mass'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1422 Gembech; 1475 gewmbetz; 1577 gömböcz. GOMBOS Gombos [gombosh]. The adjectival suffix -os denotes a maker of gomb 'button'. The Hungarian gomb may be derived from the Sumerian gam 'bent' or gišgam 'round' (Labat 1948: No. 362). The original fastener, holding two sides of a garment together, may have been a hook-like implement pushed through a hole or a loop formed by a string. The disk or knob and the button hole were later developments. It is conceivable that the original name gam was retained after the hook was changed to a disk shape. Old Hungarian spelling was Gombos in 1211. GOMORI Gömöri [gømøri]. Also spelled Gömöry. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Gömör, the name of a County in historical Hungary. Most of the County was confined to Slovakia in 1920 by the Trianon Peace Treaty and then renamed Gemer. The name is derived from the Old Turkic kömür 'coal' which is also a surname and place name in Turkic speaking countries. Old Hungarian spelling was Gumur in 1150 (Kiss 1978: 244). GONDA Gonda [gonda]. Also spelled Gunda. The name is a probable derivative of the Sumerian gun 'burden, responsibility' (Labat 1948: No. 108) which may be the antecedent of the present-day Hungarian gond 'care, worry'. Comprised of gond and the SumeroHungarian adjectival suffix -a, the name denotes a 'careful, attentive' person. The modern Hungarian form would be Gondos. GONDOS Gondos [gondosh]. See above. GORBE Görbe [gørbe]. The name describes a 'round shouldered, stooping' person. It is a composite of gör, the root of words associated with being bent. Its variants are gördül 'turn, rotate', kör 'circle', kerek 'round', kerék 'wheel'. The connecting consonant b is



49

followed by the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -e to indicate condition. The Hungarian gör may be a variant of the Sumerian gar 'to bend' (Labat 1948: No. 106), which is görbít in present-day Hungarian. The southern Slavonic source grba 'hump', listed in the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, is not convincing. GOROG Görög [gørøg]. The Hungarian name for Greek is Görög. Early Hungarian sources, when refer to the ethnic denomination Greek, include all peoples from the Balkan peninsula who belonged to the Greek Orthodox religion. Many Orthodox Serbs, Bulgars, Macedonians and other people were included in this category. Most of them entered Hungary as subjects of the Ottoman Empire during the Turkish occupation. They were privileged merchants who handled the trade between Turkish occupied Hungary and the Balkan (Ács 1986: 139). The name is the Hungarian version of an internationally shared word of obscure origin. The Greeks used it to describe themselves as early as 700 BC. The term was applied to all peoples, cities and states that possessed a common Greek language and culture (McKenzie 1965: 326). Old Hungarian spelling: 1156 Gyrki; 1395 gereg; 1416 gorog; 1500 Gewreg-; 1510 gevreg; 1538 gerewg-, gürüg. GOSZTONYI Gosztonyi [gostonji]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant of Gosztony, the Hungarian variant of Gostun, the name of a Kotrigur khan (AD 584 - 642), vassal of the Avars, whose principle territory was in the Carpathian Basin (Vernadsky 1952: 197). GOZONY Gozony [gozonj]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It may be a derivation from Gozan (no meaning) the name of a Mesopotamian region mentioned in the Bible. It is called Guzanu in Assyrian records (McKenzie 1965: 323). GROF Gróf [gro:f]. Derivation from the Austro-Bavarian grof 'count', cf. German Graf 'count'. The surname denotes a person being aristocratic by disposition if not by title. One who has the manners of an aristocrat. Old Hungarian spellings: 1358 Grof-; 1393 Grof; 1409 Groff; 1553 gróf. GUBA Guba [guba]. Guba is the name of a peasant's long sleeveless shaggy frieze cape. The name depicts a maker or seller of such capes. Guba is the archaic spelling of the more recent Gubás. Both the -a and -s are adjectival suffixes that denote occupations. Old Hungarian spelling was Guba in 1387. GUG Gug [gug]. Also spelled Gugg. This name is the root of guggol 'squat' and denotes a person in the habit of squatting. The Hungarian gug may be cognate with the Sumerian gub, kup which, according to Labat means 'to maintain an upright position' (Labat 1948: No. 206). This meaning may have been erroneously assigned to the word considering that both gub and kup are the roots of the Hungarian gubbaszt 'crouch' and kuporog 'squat'. Consequently, gug, gub and kup may derive from an older common word. Another possible source is the Sumerian gug 'pure, bright' (Labat 1948: No. 591). Old Hungarian spellings: 1548 gugg-; 1552 gug. GULYA Gulya [guja]. The root gu is followed by the connecting consonant ly [j] and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a. Gulya means 'cattle' in present-day Hungarian.



50
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
The word gu is identical with the Sumerian gu4 'ox, cattle' (Labat 1948: No. 297) both phonetically and semantically. Other Hungarian surnames derived from the same root are Gulás and Gulyás.
Old Hungarian spelling was Gulla in 1237. GYALI Gyáli [dja:li]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Gyál, a village in Pest County. The Hungarian Gyál may be a variant of the old Turkish yal 'flame' (Clauson 1972: 929), which also survived in the Hungarian title Gyula also a surname and forename. See Gyula. The location Gyál may have been the site of fire worship. Old Hungarian spelling was Gyal in 1323 (Kiss 1978: 250). GYENGE Gyenge [djenge]. The Hungarian gyenge 'weak, infirm' may be derived from the Sumerian gig 'ill, sick' (Labat 1948: No. 446). The word gyengélkedő 'ill, ailing' is derived from gyenge and has a meaning identical with its Sumerian counterpart. Old Hungarian spelling was Genge in 1347. GYOKERI Gyökéri [djøke:ri]. An unusual surname. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from the gyökér 'root'. The word gyökér is a probable compound of dug 'thrust' and ér 'vein', describing the system of membranous canals penetrating into the soil through which plants fix themselves in the earth to absorb nutrients. The Ugric source jeker, jukar 'uprooted tree', suggested by the HistoricalEtymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, only touches on exactness. Old Hungarian spelling: 1130 Guquer. GYORI Győri [djø:ri]. Also spelled Győry. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Győr, a principal city in Győr-Sopron County, ranking high in industrial production. Several explanations were advanced for the etymology of Győr. One of them is gyűr 'elevated ground in a wetland' (B. Lőrinczy 1988: 770, vol. 2). The original settlement was indeed on Káptalan-domb 'Cathedral Hill' and this etymology seems to be the most convincing. Old Hungarian spellings of Győr: 1009 Jaur-; 1213 Jewr; 1221 Geur. GYOZO Győző [djø:zø:]. 'Victor'. A probable derivation from the Sumerian giš 'successfully accomplish' (Labat 1948: No. 296). The name is comprised of győz 'succeed, win' and the participle -ő which forms adjectives from verbs. GYULA Gyula [djula]. A frequent Hungarian forename and surname. The word-final element -a is the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix which indicates rank and status. It is possible, as suggested by the first element gyul 'to ignite, to light fire', that an ancient Asian religious title of fire worship survived in the name. This is substantiated by the old Turkish yalin, yal 'flame' (Clauson 1972: 929) and present-day yalaz 'flame'. Also compare with the Sumerian ul4 'to flame, to burn' (Labat 1948: No. 10). The original religious title was later extended to include non-religious functions such as civil and military leadership (Németh 1990: 224) spelled jula, jila. The Sumerian ugula 'head, chieftain' (Labat 1948: No. 295) also shows correlation to Gyula, Jula and Gula. Old Hungarian spelling: 950 γυλά; 1075 Jula; 1150 Geula, Gyyla; GYURUS Gyűrűs [djy:ry:sh]. Derived from the Sumerian gur 'to turn around' (Labat 1948: No. 111), the Hungarian gyűrűs means a 'ring maker'. The name is comprised of



51
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
gyűr, (a word synonymous with göngyöl, gördít 'to roll') the participle -ű that forms gyűrű ‘ring’ and the adjectival suffix -s to denote a maker of rings. Similar words exist in the Altaic languages, cf. Turkish yüzük 'ring' but its suggested source is the Turkic yüz 'joint, segment' which is íz in the Hungarian language (Benkő 1967: 1988, vol. 1). For this reason the Turkic origin remains doubtful. HABOLY Haboly [haboli]. The surname is derived from Hobol, the name of a settlement in Baranya County. Now part of Szigetvár. The name is of uncertain origin. The wordfinal element -y is the archaic derivational suffix indicating a person from Hobol. HADAS Hadas [hadash]. The adjectival suffix -as is appended to had to denote involvement in military affairs. Though dictionaries list had as 'army' it is not an exact translation. The Hungarian equivalent of 'army' is hadsereg in which sereg means 'troops, multitude' but had stands rather for ‘weapon’. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language lists had as a variant of *kunta a Finno-Ugric word which can be found in the name of the Ostyak (Khanty) people. The Vogul khont 'war, army', Finn kunta 'crowd', Estonian kond 'family' and other Finno-Ugric words stem from the same root. The only Finno-Ugric word that comes close to the Hungarian had, both in phonetic value and meaning, is the Vogul khont 'war', which would make the Hungarian hadsereg translate as 'war party'. The rest of Finno-Ugric words do not fit into the Hungarian concept of had. Therefore, the source of the word should be searched somewhere else. Onomastic evidence point in the direction of the Sumerian language where the cuneiform sign for pa 'branch of a tree' is also pronounced as gišhad meaning 'wooden bat, stick'. The present-day Hungarian equivalent of 'bat' is bot. The Sumerian cuneiform sign for pa was also pronounced as bad, bat 'bat, scepter, stave' (Waddell 1927: 23). But during the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian period the pronunciation was zák and zága (Labat 1948: No.295). Both phonetic values correspond to the Hungarian ág 'branch of a tree'. The wooden bat, broken off the tree was the original rudimentary weapon of the ancient warrior and its Sumerian name survived in the Hungarian had in the sense of 'weapon'. Hence had-sereg means 'armed troops'. If the word had were sufficient to denote 'army' then there would be no need for the second word sereg 'troops'. The surname Hadas, therefore, originally meant either a maker or supplier of weapons, or articles of military nature. Hadad, the name of a Mesopotamian destructive storm god (McKenzie 1965: 329) may have been also derived from the Sumero-Hungarian had. The name was recorded in 1138 as a surname in Hungary in the form of Hadadi 'descendant of Hadad'. The word-final element -i is the derivational suffix denoting ancestry. Old Hungarian spellings of had: 1055 hodu; 1082 Hada; 1093 hod-. HADFI Hadfi [hadfi]. The present-day meaning of this name is 'warrior' comprised of had and the patronymic suffix -fi, short for fiú 'boy, young man'. Originally the name may have meant ‘son of a gunsmith’. See Hadas for the etymology of had. HADIK Hadik [hadik]. The initial element had is interpreted as 'weapon' to which the suffix -ik is appended to express an active link with the meaning of the preceding noun. The ancestor of the bearer of this name was probably a professional soldier or had a long



52
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
term relationship with the armed forces in one capacity or another. See Hadas for the etymology of had. HADNAGY Hadnagy [hadnadj]. The present-day meaning of hadnagy is 'lieutenant' but originally it denoted a 'general, commander of the army'. The name is a compound of had (see Hadas for meaning and etymology) and nagy 'great, superior, big' meaning 'chief of the armed forces'. The Hungarian nagy has similar phonetic value and meaning as the Sumerian [nu]g 'large, big' (Labat 1948: No. 72). Old Hungarian spellings: 1237 Hodnog-; 1347 Hodnogh; 1358 hadnag; 1602 Hadnagy. HAGYMASY Hagymásy [hadjma:shi]. The name denotes a descendant of Hagymás as indicated by the archaic derivational suffix -y. Hagymás is comprised of the element hagyma 'onion' and the adjectival suffix -s which denotes an occupation. Accordingly, hagymás means a 'grower or seller of onions'. The principal meaning of hagyma is 'bulb' and should be preceded by a qualifier like fokhagyma 'garlic', tulipánhagyma 'tulip bulb'. The correct form of 'onion' is vöröshagyma 'red bulb' but in routine conversation only hagyma is used. Hagyma is a probable derivation from the Finno-Ugric *koćmɜ or *kaćmɜ (Benkő 1967: 18, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spellings: 1211 Hagymas; 1497 Hagmas; 1211 Haymus, Haimus; 1237 Heymus. HAJAS Hajas [hajash]. 'Hairy'. The adjectival suffix -as indicates condition. The Hungarian haj denotes ‘hair on top of the head’ only. Hair everywhere else on the body is called szőr, except for szakál 'beard'. Haj is shared by Hungarian and other languages of the Uralic group. The reconstructed proto-word is *kajɜ (Benkő 1967: 20, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spellings: 1211 Haia; 1438 Hayas. HAJDU Hajdú [hajdu:]. Also spelled Hajtó, Hajdó. The original form is Hajtó but Hajdú is now a more frequent surname. The name is the participle of hajt 'drive, move' and was the name of Hungarian cowboys participating in long distance cattle drives. Those cattleherders did their job on foot, unlike their mounted counterparts in America. In off seasons they were hired as body guards and uniformed attendants, a job some of them retained, but continued to be called hajdú. Old Hungarian spellings: 1500 Haydo; 1513 Haydow; 1602 Hajdó. HAJNAL Hajnal [hajnal]. 'Dawn'. The name denotes an early riser. The Hungarian hajnal 'dawn' is cognate with the Vogul khuj 'dawn' and with similar words in other Ugric languages (Benkő 1967: 26, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spellings: 1372 haynal-; 1513 halnal, Hajna. HAJOS Hajós [hajo:sh]. The adjectival suffix -s denotes a ship builder, a person who served on a ship or was associated with ships in some way. The word-final element -ó in hajó 'ship' is the participle suffix. The probable root of the word is haj(-lít) 'bend, curve' describing the bent and curving boards or other material ships are built of. The Turkish kayik 'boat' is phonetically and semantically close to the Hungarian hajó but it denotes a 'kayak'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1338 Hayos; 1638 haios.



53

HALAS Halas [halash]. The adjectival suffix -as is affixed to hal 'fish' to signify a 'dealer in fish'. The Hungarian hal is related to the Ostyak (Khanty) kul, Mari (Cheremis) kol, Finnish and Estonian kala and other Uralic languages in which they all mean 'fish' (Benkő 1967: 31, vol. 2). The Uralic words appear to be cognate with the Sumerian ku6 'fish' (Labat 1948: No. 589). Old Hungarian spelling was Halas in 1240. HALASI Halasi [halashi]. Also spelled Halassy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) denotes a descendant of Halas. See Halas for etymology. HALASZ Halas [hala:s]. The formative suffix -ász is affixed to hal 'fish' to denote a specialized occupation. Halász means 'fisherman or fisher', equivalent of the English surname Fisher. See Halas for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling was halaz in 1193. HALBOR Halbőr [halbø:r]. The name is a compound of hal 'fish' and bőr 'skin, leather'. There is no apparent reason for such a word to form a surname, unless one's ancestor was a leather-dresser specializing in fish skins. Both elements of the name can be explained by the Sumerian language: ku6 'fish' (Labat 1948: No.589) and bar 'skin, leather' (Labat 1948: No. 74). It may be of importance to note that the same word is used for 'skin' and 'leather' in both the Sumerian and Hungarian languages. Both hal and bőr are present in the Uralic languages. For the etymology of hal see Halas. The reconstructed Uralic proto-word of bőr is *perɜ (Benkő 1967: 346, vol. 1), but the most probable source is the Sumerian bar. HALMI Halmi [halmi]. Also spelled Halmy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) denotes a dweller by the halom 'knoll'. Hungarians share halom with the Slavonic languages cf. Serbo-Croat hum 'heap, mound'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1055 holm-; 1193 -holm; 1303 Halum; 1340 halm; 1418 -halom. HAMAR Hamar [hamar]. 'Quick, fast, soon'. The name may have been bestowed on a fast, hardworking individual. Old Hungarian spelling was Hamar in 1327. HAMIS Hamis [hamish]. 'Insincere, cunning'. Old Hungarian spelling was Homus in 1064. HAMULA Hamula [hamula]. This name can only be partially etymologized in the Hungarian language. The segment hamu means 'ash' in present-day Hungarian but la 'plenty, abundance' (Labat 1948: No. 55) can only be found in the Sumerian language. The compound means 'plenty of ashes', which is considered to be unusual, even as a hybrid name. The Hungarian hamu's Uralic equivalent is the Ezra-Mordvin kulov 'ash, sand' and the Mordvin kulu 'ash' (Benkő 1967: 42, vol. 2). However, the ultimate source of the word may be the Sumerian ukum 'ash, sand' (Gostony 1975: 14). The Akkadian hahu 'ash' (Labat 1948: No.172) is much closer to the phonetic form of the Hungarian hamu and should also be considered as a cognate word. Old Hungarian spelling of hamu was Homu in 1211. HAMVAS Hamvas [hamvash]. The adjectival suffix -as is appended to hamv 'down,



54
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
bloom' to denote a person having a greyish complexion. Hamv is derived from hamu 'ash'. See Hamula for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling was Homvos in 1314. HARAGOS Haragos [haragosh]. 'Angry'. The name describes a person who has a chip on his shoulder. It is comprised of harag 'anger' and the adjectival suffix -os. The Hungarian word shows relevance to the Uralic languages, cf. Mordvin kor 'anger'. The reconstructed Finno-Ugric proto-word is *kore (Benkő 1967: 52, vol. 2). The Sumerian urgú 'anger' (Labat 1948: No. 22+) should also be considered. Also compare with Persian har 'mad, rabid' (Lambton 1988: 176). Old Hungarian spellings: 1211 Horogus; 1274 Haragus; 1487 Haragos. HARCOS Harcos [hartsosh]. The adjectival suffix -os is attached to harc 'fight, combat' to denote a combatant person, perhaps a soldier. The word harc is derived from the root har(-zsol), hor(-zsol) 'graze, scratch' which is identical with the Sumerian hur 'to scratch' (Thomsen 1984: 307). Old Hungarian spelling was harchos in 1560. HARGITAI Hargitai [hargitai]. Also spelled Hargitay. The name denotes a dweller by the Hargita a mountain range in Transylvania, confined to Romania in 1920. The name is of Sumerian origin comprised of har a variant of kur 'mountain' (Labat 1948: No. 364), gi10 'peak' (Labat 1948: No. 173) and ta 'without' (Labat 1948: No. 139). The compound Hargita would translate as 'mountain range without peaks'. The word final element -i (archaic -y) is the derivational suffix. HARMAT Harmat [harmat]. 'Dew'. Also spelled Harmath. A quiet person who achieves results in a subtle way, like the materialization of dew, may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling was Harmat- in 1355. HARSANY Harsány [harsha:nj]. The nominal suffix -ány is appended to the root hars 'loud' to indicate a person having a booming voice. Old Hungarian spelling was Harsany in 1616. HASAB Hasáb [hasha:b]. The name denotes a 'log of split wood', signifying a person involved in either splitting wood or selling it. The root has 'split, crack, tear', to which the unproductive -áb is suffixed, may be cognate with similar words in the Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *kaćɜ (Benkő 1967: 67, vol. 2). The Uralic word may be a derivation from the Sumerian ḫaš 'to break', or the Akkadian hasâsu 'to cut' (Labat 1948: No. 12). Compare with Hungarian hasít ‘split, cleave’. HASKA Haska [hashka]. The archaic adjectival suffix -a signifies a person engaged in splitting (wood?) or breaking (stone?). The intermediate k is a connecting consonant. See Hasab for etymology of has. HATAR Határ [hata:r]. A person from the frontier region may have been named Határ 'frontier, border'. The Hungarian word may be a variant of the Akkadian kudurru 'boundary' (Labat 1948: No. 97). HAZAI Hazai [hazai]. Also spelled Hazay. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) denotes a person from the haza 'native land', derived from ház 'house'. The Hungarian ház is cognate with other Finno-Ugric words like the Ostyak kat 'house'. The reconstructed proto-word is *kota (Benkő 1967: 76, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling was haza in 1256. HEGEDUS Hegedűs [hegedy:sh]. 'Violinist'. The Hungarian hegedű 'violin' is a probable



55
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
derivative of the Sumerian gi-gi-du16 'violin' (Gostony 1975: 73). Old Hungarian spellings: 1394 Hegedus; 1396 Hegedews; 1418 Hegedes; 1550 hegedös; 1552 hegedüs. HEJJA Héjja [he:ja]. Also spelled Hélya. Both names are distorted forms of héja 'hawk'. A keeper of hawks or a rapacious person may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling was Héja in 1602. HEPPES Heppes [hepesh]. The reduplication of p marks a stressed consonant. The adjectival suffix -es is attached to hepp(-eg) 'walk slowly' to denote an individual who walks with a halt. HID Híd [hi:d]. The name suggests a dweller by the híd 'bridge'. See Hidas for more detail. HIDAS Hidas [hidash]. A dweller near a bridge may have been named so. It may also denote a toll-gate attendant at a bridge. The name incorporates the word híd 'bridge' and the adjectival suffix -as which indicates occupation. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language lists híd as an Alanic loan-word. But most likely híd is derived from the Sumerian id 'river' (Labat 1948: No. 579). This Sumerian word is written with the combination of two independent cuneiform signs: a 'water' (Labat 1948: No. 578) and zikum 'top, roof' (Labat 1948: No. 484). Thus, the appropriate interpretation of the cuneiform sign for id would be a rooflike structure across a body of water, that would likely be a (covered) bridge, which Hungarians call híd. Old Hungarian spellings: 1231 Hydus-; 1358 Hydas; HIDASI Hidasi [hidashi]. Also spelled Hidassy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Hidas. See Hidas for more explanation. HIDI Hídi [hidi]. Also spelled Hídy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a dweller by a híd 'bridge'. See Hid and Hidas for more information. HIRES Híres [hi:resh]. The adjectival suffix -es is appended to hír 'news, report' to indicate a 'famous, well-known' individual, i.e. one talked about a lot, or is in the news frequently. Old Hungarian spelling was hyres in 1507. HITES Hites [hitesh]. The adjectival suffix -es is affixed to hit 'trust, faith' to denote a person in a capacity that requires taking an oath, i.e. a sworn, legitimate. Old Hungarian spelling was Hotus, Hutos, Hitu in 1138. HOGYE Hőgye [hø:dje]. Comprised of hőgy 'ermine' and the archaic Hungarian adjectival suffix -e the name denotes an 'ermine-hunter'. This occupation would be hőgyes or hőlgyész in present-day Hungarian. Old Hungarian spelling was heulg- in 1324. HOLLO Holló [holo:]. 'Raven'. The reduplication of l marks a stressed consonant. The name may owe its origin to the jet-black hair of a person. Hungarians refer to deep black color as holló fekete 'raven-black'. A person having such hair may have been named Holló.
Similar words are in other Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *kulɜ (Benkő 1967: 134, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spellings: 1231 Holo; 1315 Hollo; 1602 Holló. HOMOKI Homoki [homoki]. Also spelled Homoky. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y)



56
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
indicates a person from an area of sandy soil. The word homok means 'sand' in the Hungarian language. Sand is pulverized rock, which puts the root hom (the word-final element -ok is the plural number) in a close proximity of the Sumerian hum 'to pulverize, to crush' (Labat 1948: No. 565). Similar words exist in the Turkic languages, cf. Turkish kum (plural: kumluk) 'sand'. Old Hungarian spelling was humuk in 1055. HONFI Honfi [honfi]. Comprised of hon 'home, native land' and the patronymic suffix fi, the name denotes a 'son of the native land'. The Hungarian hon may be a variant of the Sumerian unu 'residence' (Labat 1948: No. 195). HONOS Hónos [ho:nosh]. The name cannot be explained entirely in the Hungarian language. The element hón is present only in hónalj 'armpit', where alj 'bottom' suggests a part of the body under the hón, a term that became obsolete in the Hungarian language a long time ago. The Udmurt (Sarapul-Votyak) word for 'armpit’ is kun-ul (Benkő 1967: 141, vol. 2), in which the element kun is identical with the Sumerian kun 'shoulder' (Labat 1948: No. 77). It is therefore suggested that the Hungarian hón, the Udmurt kun and other similar Uralic words are derived from the Sumerian kun. The adjectival suffix -os, attached to hón, suggests a 'broad-shouldered' person who would be called vállas in present-day Hungarian. HORDOSY Hordósy [hordo:shi]. Also spelled Hordóssy. The archaic derivational suffix -y denotes a descendant of Hordós 'cooper'. The adjectival suffix -s, attached to hordó 'barrel, cask', signifies occupation. The word hordó is comprised of the element hord 'carry' and the participle -ó. The word hord may be compared to the reconstructed Ugric proto-word *kurɜ (Benkő 1967: 145, 146, vol. 2) with reservations. The ultimate source of hordó may be the Sumerian gur7 'tun, cask for wine' (Labat 1948: No. 542) followed by the connecting consonant d and the participle -ó. Old Hungarian spellings: 1391 Hordow; 1587 hordo; 1629 hordós. HORVAT Horvát [horva:t]. Also spelled Horváth. It denotes the ethnic name 'Croat'. The word final element -h is added to mark the reduced plosion of the preceding t. The initial element hor is most likely derived from the Slavonic word for 'mountain' and signifies a mountaineer' or 'highlander', a name probably given to them by lowlanders, people of the plain. Cf. Czech, Slovak hora, Serbian, Croatian gora, Polish góra, from which Góral, the name of a mountain-dwelling people in the Northern-Carpathians, is derived. The Slavonic variants may be cognate with the Persian (Indo-European) kuh 'mountain' (Lambton 1988: 307). However, the ultimate source of the word may be the Sumerian (Non-IndoEuropean) kur 'mountain' (Labat 1948: No. 366). It may be of interest that Hor was also a mountain in ancient Palestine, located in South-West Jordan and identified with the present-day Jebel Harun (Barnhart 1954: 2051, vol. 2). The v connects the root hor to the suffix -át, which converts verbs and nouns to derived nouns. It may be called a nominal suffix with caution, when appended to a verb. But, to my knowledge, there is no generally accepted appropriate English term when



57
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
suffixed to a noun. In that case it may be included in the category of formatives. Examples: nyug 'repose' > nyugat 'west'; mag 'seed' > magzat 'embryo, offspring'; húz 'draw' > huzat > 'draft'. Old Hungarian spellings: 1138 Horuat, Huruat, Hwruat; 1309 Huruath; 1377 Horwath; 1511 Horváth. HULINYI Hulinyi [hulinji]. The name has no meaning in present-day Hungarian. It may be derived from the Sumerian hul 'mischief' (Labat 1948: No. 456) to which -iny is suffixed to denote a collective noun. The word-final element -i is the derivational suffix indicating a descendant of Huliny 'rascal'. HUSSAR Huszár [husa:r]. A member of the Hungarian light cavalry is called huszár. The hussars were formed as a military unit to pursue the fleeing enemy. It may be the altered form of the Sumerian húb-sar 'to pursue, to hunt' (Labat 1948: No. 88). The Slavonic husa 'theft', the Latin corsarius 'pirate' or the Byzantine hosarios 'spy' (Benkő 1967: 174, vol. 2) are not convincing sources. Old Hungarian spellings: 1432 huzor; 1449 Hwzar; 1477 Huzar; 1558 huszár. HUSVAR Húsvár [hu:shva:r]. The word húsvár has no possible reason to form a surname. It is comprised of hús 'meat, flesh' and vár 'fort'. However, hús in this name may have its source in the Sumerian language where kuš means 'leather, pelt, skin' (Labat 1948: No. 7) and the Hungarian vár 'fort' may be derived from the Sumerian bar 'circular wall' (Deimel 1939: No. 49). Therefore kušbar means ‘a wall made of pelts’. A dweller in such dwelling may have been named so. HUVOS Hűvös [hy:vøsh]. ‘Cool, reserved’. The name consists of the root hű(v) ‘cool’ and the adjectival suffix -ös indicates character. Old Hungarian spelling was Huuus in 1211. IFJU Ifjú [ifju:]. Also spelled Ifijú. 'Young man, lad'. The name may be derived from the Sumerian ibila 'young man, lad' (Deimel 1939: No. 112). The word ifiú is listed in the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language as a compound of i and fiú. The initial element i is the same as the Ostyak äi 'small, young' (Benkő 190, vol. 2), while fiú is derived from the Finno-Ugric *pojka (Benkő 1948: 925, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spellings: 1320 Ifyu-; 1372 yfyo-; 1604 Ifiju. IGAZ Igaz [igaz]. 'True'. A 'trusty, faithful' person may have been named so. Old Hungarian spellings: 1300 ygoz; 1348 Igaz-. IHASZ Ihász [iha:s]. A regional form of juhász 'shepherd' in Somogy County. The name is comprised of ih, a variant of juh 'sheep' and the formative suffix -ász to indicate a specialized occupation. Old Hungarian spelling was Ihaz in 1400. IJJAS Ijjas [ijash]. The adjectival suffix -as is preceded by íj 'bow' (weapon) to denote an 'archer or bowyer'. Reduplication of j marks a stressed consonant. The Hungarian íj is of obscure origin, probably derived from an older í, the root of ív 'arch, bend' (Benkő 1967: 195, vol. 2). Another possible source is the Sumerian illu 'arch' (Gostony 1975: 69). The Sumerian origin is supported by the Hungarian surname Illos 'bowyer’, which cannot be explained in the present-day vernacular. The Hungarian íj may be cognate with the Ostyak juxat, Syrian juxal, Cumanian



58
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
jaa, Chinese i, all having the same meaning (Gostony 1975: 69). Old Hungarian spelling was Jgyartho 'bow-maker' in 1446. ILKU Ilku [ilku]. This name cannot be explained in the Hungarian language. It may be the unchanged form of the Sumerian ilku which would translate as 'professional soldier’. The majority of these soldiers was drawn from the upper class of each city-state and was constantly at the king's disposal (Woolley 1965: 59-60, 112-114). The pre-thirteenth-century Turkish ilk 'first in order of time and place' (Clauson 1972: 140) may be cognate with the Sumerian ilku in a sense of indicating the highest ranking social class. In modern Turkish ilk means '(the) first, initial, primary'. ILLOS Illos [ilosh]. The adjectival suffix -os is attached to i 'bow' to denote a 'bowyer'. The reduplicated l indicates a stressed consonant which functions as a connecting sound in this case. See Ijjas for more explanation. ILMA Ilma [ilma]. The name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. It may signify an important leader in the Sumerian language by compounding il 'important, eminent, great' (Labat 1948: No. 205) and mah 'powerful, influential, leading' (Labat 1948: No. 57). The Finnish ilma 'air, atmosphere, weather' may also be considered. Ilma was the name of the weather-god in ancient Finnish society. IMECS Imecs [imech]. The second element -ecs may be the distorted form of the adjectival suffix -es which denotes an occupation. The initial element im 'tablet, document' is a Sumerian word (Labat 1948: No. 339). Therefore Imecs denotes a person involved with clay tablets and documents. Probably an archivist. The word imecs means 'horse fly' in the Gyergyó dialect of Transylvania (B. Lőrinczy 1988: 1077, vol. 2), but would be an unlikely source for a surname. IMOLA Imola [imola]. A dweller near an imola 'swampland full of reed-grass'. Old Hungarian spelling was imola in 1193. IMRE Imre [imre]. The oldest known reference to this name is the son of Hungary's St. Stephen (975-1038) called Imre. Two theories exist for the origin of the name. 1. From the well-publicized German Amalrich which consists of Amal, the name of an old Gothic royal family, and rich, believed to be the German equivalent of the Latin rex 'king' (Ladó 1978: 170). 2. From the Akkadian nimru 'leopard' (Labat 1948: No. 444) of which Imru, Imre, Imró may be the aphetic forms. The name of biblical Nimrod and the ancient Mesopotamian city of Nimrud are derived from the same source. Old Hungarian spellings: 1374 Imbregh; 1438 Emreh; 1466 Embre; 1526 Imreh. IMREDY Imrédy [imre:di]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates place of origin, the suffix -d denotes a place called Imre. See Imre for more information. IMREGH Imregh [imreg]. An archaic form of Imre. See Imre for more information. IMREY Imrey [imrei]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a descendant of Imre. See Imre for more information. INKEY Inkey [inkei]. The name cannot be explained in the present-day Hungarian language. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a descendant of Inke. A probable source is the Sumerian in 'flax, linen' (Labat 1948: No. 148) to which the SumeroHungarian adjectival suffix -e is added to denote an occupation. The intermediate k is a connecting consonant. The name denotes a descendant of a flax grower or processor.



59
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
The surnames Lenke and Lenkei are derived from the present-day Hungarian word len 'flax', an indication that flax was a source of names. ISTENES Istenes [ishtenesh]. 'God-fearing'. The adjectival suffix -es is attached to isten 'god' to indicate character. The Hungarian isten is phonetically identical with the Akkadian ištên 'one, the only one (Labat 1948: No. 1, 480). Akkadian was a Semitic language that supplanted the older Sumerian language in Mesopotamia c. 2000 BC. Many linguists believe that the Akkadians borrowed Sumerian words and there are implications that ištên is one of them. Ištên was the Mid-Babylonian pronunciation of the Sumerian cuneiform sign aš 'one, the only one' (Labat 1948: No. 1, 480). Survived in the Assyrian language as ištin ‘one’. 'One' means egy in the Hungarian language and it may be the present-day reference to the old concept of god. The Church, as an organization, is called egyház 'house of one', i. e. 'house of god' by Hungarians. This is synonymous with their religious belief that god is and always been a single entity. Individual churches in towns and cities were also called egyház as indicated by toponyms such as Nyíregyháza 'house of one in Nyír'. See Dicshazi for more information. Old Hungarian spelling was isten in 1195. JAGER Jáger [ja:ger]. Hungarian spelling of the German Jäger 'hunter'. JAKI Jáki [ja:ki]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Ják, a town in Vas County. This name cannot be explained in the Hungarian language. The most probable source is the Turkish yakmak 'to light, to set on fire' (Akdikmen 1986: 400), derived from the Chagatai -Osmanli root jaq 'to set on fire’ (Györffy 1990: 179). The suffix -mak is often used when listing verbs in Turkish dictionaries. The location of the town may have been a sacred site for fire worship in antiquity, thus the name Ják. JAMBOR Jámbor [ja:mbor]. Compounded from jó 'good' and ember 'man' jámbor means 'pious, humble, tolerant' (Benkő 1967: 258, vol. 2). The word jó 'good' is present in other Ugric languages in similar phonetic forms. The reconstructed proto-word is *jamɜ or *jomɜ (Benkő 1967: 275, vol. 2). See Ember for etymology of the second element in the name. Old Hungarian spellings: 1251 Joember; 1461 Jambor. JANITSARY Janitsáry [janicha:ri]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a descendant of Janitsár, a name derived from the Turkish yeniçeri 'janissary'. The word yeniçeri is a compound of yeni 'new' and çeri 'troops, army'. A soldier of such army that was originally made up of Christian slaves was referred to as janicsár and janitsár by Hungarians. Old Hungarian spellings: 1448 Janchaar; 1553 janicsár-. JANY Jány [ja:nj]. The informal spelling of leány 'girl, maiden' is jány and lyány, which may be etymologized as a compound of the Uralic *laj- 'little' and *ańa 'mother' (Benkő 1967: 734, vol. 2). Another etymology could be the Sumerian lal 'smaller' and ama 'mother' (Labat 1948: No. 481). It is an unusual surname in a patriarchal society unless it originated a long time ago during matriarchal times. Old Hungarian spellings: 1193 leajn; 1339 Leany-, Lyan-; 1526 Lyany; 1596



60
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
leány-. JARAI Járai [ja:rai]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant of Jára 'walker'. The participle -ó supplanted the Sumero-Hungarian suffix -a when adjectives were formed from a verb. It is spelled járó in present-day Hungarian. The root jár means 'walk, go'. The Hungarian jár is of uncertain derivation. It is present in the Finno-Ugric languages, the reconstructed proto-word is *jorɜ (Benkő 1967: 261, vol. 2). But similar forms are derived from yür in the Turkic languages, cf. Turkish yürümek 'to walk, to go'. The word-final element -mek is the infinitive, often used when listing verbs in a dictionary. The Sumerian gir 'foot' may also be interpreted in the sense of 'walk' (Gostony 1975: 32). Old Hungarian spellings: 1195 iarov; 1299 -yarew; 1349 Iar-; 1385 Jaro. JARO Járó [ja:ro:]. 'Walker'. See Jarai for explanation. JASZ Jász [ja:s]. This name denotes a person from the Jász ethnic group in Hungary. Their name, origin and presence in Hungary are unclear. Some historians believe they are the descendants of the Sarmatian Jazigs who lived in Hungary around the beginning of the Christian era (Ács 1986: 87). Others presume them to be of Iranian origin and put their entry into Hungary in the 14th century. The name appears to be cognate with the Ossetian Asy, Asi (Benkő 1967: 263, vol. 1) a people of the Central Caucasus Mountains, now known as Kabardino-Balkaria. Old Hungarian spellings: 1318 Jaz-; 1335 Jaaz; 1416 iaz-; 1881 Gyász-. JATEKOS Játékos [ja:te:kosh]. 'Playful'. The name is comprised of the root ját, the nominal suffix -ék denoting the result of action and the adjectival suffix -os indicating involvement. Old Hungarian spelling was yatekos in 1546. The Finno-Ugric *jukta 'story, talk', tentatively suggested by the HistoricalEtymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, is doubtful. JAVAS Javas [javash]. A probable derivative of the Turkish yavaş 'quiet, gentle'. The Hungarian javas may denote a knowledgeable person who was sought after for advice, a kind of medicine man. JEG Jég [je:g]. 'Ice'. A cool-headed, unemotional person may have been named so. The word jég 'ice' is shared with other Finno-Ugric languages in similar forms and meanings, cf. Finnish jää 'ice'. The reconstructed proto-word is *jäηe (Benkő 1967: 268, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spellings: 1156 Jegu; 1405 ieg; 1510 jeg(-es). JEGES Jeges [jegesh]. 'Ice (delivery) man'. The adjectival suffix -es denotes an occupation. See Jeg for more information. JEKELY Jékely [je:kej]. A probable distorted form of the ethnic denomination Székely, name of the Hungarian speaking indigenous people of Transylvania. See Székely for more information. JENO Jenő [jenø:]. Contrary to popular belief the Hungarian Jenő is not derived from the Greek Eugene 'well born' but from the name of a tribe in Hungary around the turn of the first millennium AD. The name is of Turkic origin, describing a yeni 'new' tribe that



61
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
joined the already existing union of old tribes. Place names in Hungary reveal that members of the Jenő tribe have dispersed in the Carpathian Basin. Old Hungarian spelling was Jeneu in 1236 and Jenew 1461. JOBBAGY Jobbágy [jobadj]. The reduplication of b marks a stressed consonant. The word jobbágy is translated in dictionaries as 'serf' (Országh 1974: 952, vol. 1) but their status was no better than that of slaves. The jobbágys were agrarian people, devoid of rights, who worked on the estate of their landlords. They were subjected to heavy taxes and services by their landlords, the State and the Clergy. Their landlords had jurisdiction over them and they had severe restrictions in personal freedom. The landlord also had the humiliating nászjog 'the right to spend the first night with the bride of his subjects'. There are no reliable records of how and when slavery started in Hungary or what the etymology of jobbágy is. However, there is reason to believe that the Limigantes, slaves of the Sarmatians and Argaragantes, spoke the Hungarian language. Ammianus Marcellinus (c. 330-395) Roman chronicler mentions in his Rerum Gestarum that the Limigantes called Roman Emperor Constantius II (317-361) a marha 'stupid ox' (Libri XIX, Section 11, Entry 10) during an altercation by the Danube in the Fourth Century AD. This derogatory epithet is still used by present-day Hungarians. The suggestion by the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language that jobbágy is derived from jobb 'better' and denoted 'nobility' at one time (Benkő 1967: 276, vol. 2) is beyond comprehension. It does not explain the presence of the second element -ágy, which means 'bed' as an independent word, thus the compound of the two words would mean 'better bed', a term difficult to explain, especially when assigned to denote either nobility or slaves. The Hungarian jobbágy appears to be a distorted compound, derived from various linguistic sources. The following languages may be considered: Latin iugum 'slavery'; Greek opados 'servant'; Hebrew obad ( as in obadyahu 'slave of Yahweh'); Persian bande and abd 'slave'; Babylonian abed 'slave'; Arabic abd ‘servant’ (male), ubayd ‘servant of lower rank’. Old Hungarian spellings: 1229 Joubag; 1247 iobag; 1265 Jobag; 1333 Jobagy. JONAS Jónás [jo:na:sh]. The Hungarian version of Ionian. The name denotes one whom relocated from the Ionian Islands off the coast of Greece. It is comprised of Iona and the adjectival suffix -s. JOZAN Józan [jo:zan]. 'Sober'. A non-drinker may have been named so. Old Hungarian spellings: 1401 Jozan; 1602 Józon. JUHASZ Juhász [juha:s]. ‘Shepherd’. The name incorporates juh 'ewe' and the suffix -ász which denotes a specialized occupation. The Hungarian juh is phonetically close to the Sumerian u8 'ewe' (Labat 1948: No. 494). Old Hungarian spellings: 1400 Ihaz; 1423 Jwhaz; 1602 Joház. JUTASI Jutasi [jutashi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Jutas, a village in Veszprém County. The village may have received its name after Jutocsa, the third son of prince Árpád (c. 900 AD.). The personal name Jutocsa is derived from a similar Turkish name which means 'gluttonous' (Kiss 1978: 306). Cf. Turkish yutmak 'to gulp'. The suffix -mak is often used when listing verbs in a dictionary. The toponym Jutas is comprised of jut, the Hungarian spelling of the Turkish yut,

and the adjectival suffix -as to denote character. KACSAK. Kacsák [kacha:k]. Derived from the Turkish kaçak 'fugitive'. KACSOH. Kacsóh [kacho:]. Variant of kacsó 'little hand'. A probable derivation from kacs 'tendril' to which the participle -ó is suffixed. Like a tendril, a child's hand grabs and holds on to everything it can touch, thus the analogy. A person having small hands may have been named so. A probable source is the Akkadian qâtu 'hand, palm' (Labat 1948: No. 126). Old Hungarian spelling: 1459 Kaczo; 1750 kacsó-. KADAR. Kádár [ka:da:r]. The name has two possible meanings. Kádár means 'cooper' in present-day Hungarian, comprised of kád 'tub' and the nominal suffix -ár. The word kád is present in languages other than Hungarian, cf. Greek kados 'vessel', German kad 'tank, cistern', Latin cadus 'large earthen vessel'. It is also present in the Slavonic languages in the form of kad, kada, kadi.
However the ultimate source may be the Sumerian kàd 'to tie, to attach'. The staves of a wooden vessel are bound together by hoops and the person who had the skill to bind them would have been called kádár. The German Faβbinder ‘cooper, (tubbinder)’ is also derived from Binde ‘band, tie’. Another equally possible source is the Hun-Scythian kadar 'Lord Chief Justice', which became a surname (Benkő 1967: 301, vol. 2). Compare with Turkish kadi 'Moslem judge' (Akdikmen 1986: 206). Old Hungarian spelling: 1142 Cadar; 1282 Kadar. KAJTAR. Kajtár [kajta:r]. 'Rummager'. The name is comprised of kajt 'rummage' and the nominal suffix -ár indicating habitual activity. Old Hungarian spelling: 1346 Kaythar; 1429 Kaytor. KAKUSZI. Kakuszi [kakusi]. Also spelled Kakuszy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Kakusz. The name may be derived from the Turkish kokuz, Osmanli kokoz 'penniless, destitute' (Clauson 1972: 614). KALDOR. Káldor [ka:ldor]. A probable derivation from the Greek kaletor 'messenger, emissary'. KALLO. Kalló [kalo:]. The name contains the root kall 'hit, beat' and the participle -ó. It denotes a 'fulling mill' or a 'fuller'. The more precise term for a ‘fuller’ is kallós. Old Hungarian spelling: 1237 Colov; 1295 Kallov; 1332 Kollo; 1673 kallo; 1809 Kallós. KALOCSA. Kalocsa [kalocha]. The phrase kalócsa denotes a 'wooden brace', shaped like
ʌ, placed on top of thatched roofs to hold in place the straw or rushes. This phrase is used among the Hungarian speaking Székelys of Transylvania (B. Lőrinczy 1992: 49, vol. 3). A roofer specializing in such braces may have been named so. The initial element kal may be of Sumerian origin meaning 'strong' (Labat 1948: No. 322), which is erős in the Hungarian language. The function of a brace is to fasten or secure erősít in Hungarian. In kalocsa the act of fastening or securing is represented by kal.
KAMPOS. Kampós [kampo:sh]. A descriptive name for a person who uses a walkingstick for support. From the Hungarian kampó 'a hook, a bend' to which the adjectival suffix -s is attached to denote possession of an implement. The Greek kampe 'hook, bend' is identical with the Hungarian word, but the most probable origin is the Sumerian gam

'to bend, bent' (Labat 1948: No. 362). Old Hungarian spelling: 1643 kajmó-; 1818 kampu, gampó, kompó. KAPALO. Kapáló [kapa:lo:]. There are two words in the Hungarian language to denote a 'hoer' kapás and kapáló. Both are derived from kapa 'hoe'. This agricultural tool is used for scraping the earth in a shallow depth to clear it from weeds. Though, similar words exist in the Slavonic languages, like kopat, kopati 'to scrape, to hoe', the most likely source would be the Akkadian kâparu 'to clear' (Labat 1948: No. 225). The Hungarian kapar 'scrape' appears to be cognate with the Akkadian word. Old Hungarian spelling: 1638 kapallo; 1700 kapáló. KAPOS. kapós [kapo:sh]. The name denotes a popular person, sought after for his/her skills. A respected member of society (Bárczi-Országh 1960: 743, vol. 3). The name incorporates the root kap 'grab, obtain' and the adjectival suffix -ós to denote character. The Turkish kapiş 'snatch' may be cognate with the Hungarian kap. KARIKAS. Karikás [karika:sh]. A bow-legged person may have received such a name. The name is derived from karika 'circular, round' to which the adjectival suffix -s is added to indicate condition. KARPATI Kárpáti [ka:rpa:ti]. 'A dweller in the Carpathian mountains'. The name is comprised of the Sumerian kur 'mountain' (Labat 1948: No. 346), pát a rare Middle Babylonian phonetic value of the Sumerian be that means 'to extend, to stretch out' (Labat 1948: No. 69) and the derivational suffix -i. The Hungarian name for the mountain range is Kárpátok, the word-final element -ok is the plural number. The surname's verbatim translation is 'a dweller in the mountains that stretch out'. KAZI Kazi [kazi]. There are several possibilities for the origin of this name, but none of them are from the Hungarian language. The Persian qazi ‘judge’ which is derived from the Arabic language (Lambton 1988: 118). Then in the Turkic Chagatai language kaz means ‘to wander’ to which the derivational suffix –i is attached, denoting the descendant of a wanderer. The Estonian käzi ‘hand’ may also be considered, c. f. Hungarian kéz ‘hand. KEMENY Kemény [keme:nj]. "Hard, firm'. The name suggests a reserved, strict individual, one that can be trusted. The root of the name kem- is from the Finno-Ugric *kämä. Cf. Finnish kämä 'rigid, unbending', Samoyed and Selkup? koom 'hard' (Benkő 1967: 437, vol. 2). The word-final element -ny is the substantive suffix, indicating an instrument of action. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Kemend; 1267 Kemyn; 1334 Kemeyn; 1448 kemen; 1560 kemeny. KERO. Kérő. [ke:rø:]. The closest translation of this word is 'best man' of the groom. One of the duties of the kérő in rural Hungary was to ask for the hand of the bride-elect. The groom-to-be kept a low profile during this process. The best man arranged and organized the wedding; he was the go between the parents (Ortutay 1980: 543, vol. 3). This practice tapered out after WW II. The name is a composite of the verb kér 'ask, request' and the participle -ő to form an adjective that indicates action. The equivalents of the Magyar kér are present in other Finno-Ugric languages cf. Votyak kur-, kural-, 'ask', Zyryan korni 'ask' (Benkő 1967: 452, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Kere; 1350 Querie; 1395 kerew.

KILLIAN Killián [kilia:n]. The name originates in the Celtic languages pronounced [killee-un] meaning ‘a churchman’. Also spelled Cillian, it is derived from ceall meaning ‘church’ (McLaughlin 2011: 206, 213). KO. Kő [kø:]. 'Stone'. Name of a dweller by a prominent stone landmark or quarry, in which case he could be a stonecutter named after the material he works with. Another form of kő is kű in a regional dialect. This form is identical with the Sumerian ku 'rock' (Gostony 1975: 59). Similar words are in other Finno-Ugric languages, such as Vogul kü, Zyryan ki, Votyak ko, Finn kivi (Benkő 1967: 601, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1009 Kw; 1055 ku-; 1067 Kuu; 1211 Keuue; 1777 kü. KOLOK. Kölök [køløk]. A regional variant of kölyök 'kid, brat'. Originally denoted the young of an animal while being nurtured by the female. The reason for such surname is obscure, so is its etymology. The most probable origin is among the Turkic languages where the hypothetical reconstructed old Chuwash form is *kölik (Benkő 1967: 608, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1165? chulches; 1219 Culqed; 1221 Kewlked; 1383 Kelked; 1395 kelk; 1530 kelek; 1808 Kölyög, külök. KOMLODI Komlódi [komlo:di]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Komlód, a village in Szatmár County of historical Hungary, confined to Romania in 1920 by the Trianon Peace Treaty and the spelling was romanianized to Comlod. The place name is comprised of komló 'hop plant and its bitter cones', used for flavoring beer. The suffix -d is a grammatical designator denoting a place. The name may have been given to a place abundant in hops. Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 Qumlou-; 1208 Komlou-; 1240 Cumlo-; 1363 Komlo-. The word komló is of old Turkish origin according to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language. It is present in various forms in the Turkic and Finno-Ugric languages, but the explanation is concluded with a contradiction: The Turkish derivation is hindered by phonetic discrepancies (Benkő 1967: 573, vol. 2). Another concept is that the Turkish kunlak 'hop plant' is a German loan word from an [unnamed] verb that means 'to creep'. Variants can be found in many Germanic, Scandinavian, Slavonic and Finno-Ugric languages. However, the earliest recorded form was the Latin humlo, humulo during the 8th and 9th Century AD (Clauson 1972: 628). The Hungarian form Kumolou in 1264 suggests Latin influence. KONYA. Kónya [konja]. A ‘drooping, bent’ person may have been named so. The Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a is added to the root kony which may be cognate with the Sumerian kun4 and kun5 which were translated by René Labat as 'stairs' (Labat 1948: No. 142, 144). A flight of stairs is a surface repeatedly bending at sharp angles to permit ascent or descent from one level to another. The bending of the steps must have been recognized as being the significant feature of their construction if the Sumerian word is compared with the Hungarian köny(ök) 'elbow', and Kany-(ar) ‘curve’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1333 Kona; 1339 Konya; 1679 kónya. KOROM. Korom [korom]. 'Soot'. Either a 'stoker' or a 'chimney sweep' was named so. The word korom is of Turkish origin, cf. Osmanli kurum 'soot' (Akdikmen 1986: 247).

Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Corom; 1338 Korom-; 1340 Korum; 1405 kurom. KOTELES. Köteles [køtelesh]. 'Rope-maker'. The name is comprised of kötél 'rope' and the adjectival suffix -es to indicate an occupation. The word kötél is derived from köt 'bind, tie' and cognate with other Finno-Ugric words such as the Vogul köt, Finn kytkeä. But the ultimate source may be the Sumerian kád 'to tie, to twist' (Labat 1948: No. 63). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Kuteles; 1456 keteles; 1495 köteles. KOVACS. Kovács [kova:ch]. Also spelled Kovác, Kovách and Kovack. An occupational name, kovács 'blacksmith' may be a relic from the Stone Age. The Hungarian version of the name is comprised of ko, the intrusive v and ács. The initial element ko (kő and kű means 'stone, rock' in present-day Hungarian) is the root of kova 'flint', the material used for making stone implements in the Stone Age. A person involved in such activity would have been called kova ács. The word ács expresses a process which results in a roughhew, like the work of a blacksmith as compared to a goldsmith. As an independent word ács now means 'carpenter' in modern Hungarian, an indication that the work does not require top-grade workmanship. See Acs for etymology. Kova-ács was then compounded into kovács, preserving the name of the original rough method used for stone tools. Old Hungarian spelling: 1075 kouzch-; 1193 coach; 1230 Cuach; 1380 cowach; 1444 Kouacz; 1453 Kowach. The difference between stone, ore and metal may not have been obvious to early men for they all have similar consistencies. While working with rocks containing veins of metal, the discovery was made that part of the rock can be hammered into a desired shape. Thus the material changed, but the name of the process remained the same: kovács.
The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, published during the Soviet Era, identifies the Slavonic languages as the source of kovács, without explaining what each segment means in those languages. The presence of this word in those languages does not automatically point to their origin. The Slavonic form is identical with the Hungarian kovács and means 'blacksmith', but similar forms and identical meanings are present in the Gaelic languages as well. Cf. Scottish gobha, old Irish goba, old Welsh gob, Cornish gof, Breton go and Gaulish gobân (MacBain 1982). Therefore a common source for the Hungarian, Slavonic and Gaelic 'smith' should be sought for. The letters g and k are regarded transposable. Cowan 'blacksmith' is a Scottish surname (Sims MCMLXIX: 32), the form Gowan is present in McGowan 'son of the smith (Cottle 1978: 245). The Hungarian kű was present in the Sumerian language in the perceived phonetic form kù. This word preceded the names of hard, stone-like materials in their language, like kù-an 'meteorite iron' (literally 'rock from heaven') or kù-babar 'silver' (Labat 1948: No. 468). The Sumerian ku is associated both with 'rock' and 'metal' by Anton Deimel (Gostony 1975: 139), which clearly indicates the confusion about rock, ore and metal in antiquity. KOVER. Kövér [køve:r]. A 'fat' person may have been named so. The Hungarian kövér 'fat' is not present in any other language, except perhaps in Sumerian where kur4 means 'to be fat, heavy' (Deimel 1939: No 293). Old Hungarian spelling: 1231 Chuer; 1395 keuer; 1405 kiue[r]; 1519 küér.

KOZAK Kozák [koza:k]. The Hungarian Kozák corresponds to the English Cossack. The name belongs to one of the many tribes of Altaic descent who in antiquity occupied the vast territory from the Black Sea to the Aral Sea. They adapted to the Slavonic languages after becoming a special military caste of the Czarist regime in Imperial Russia. The earliest written record of their name in Hungary is in 1530 spelled kozák. There are many intriguing explanations and according to one of them the term kozák may have originated from a Tatar word meaning 'freeman' (Barnhart 1954: 1099). Alternatively, the name may not have any ethnic significance at all, but have its origin in a tenth century Arabic word denoting a 'freebooter' or 'nomad soldier' (Longworth 1970: 344). However, most authorities agree that it is derived from the old Turkic root gaz 'to wander', which forms the primary element in the Turcoman gäzäk 'wanderer, nomad' (Németh 1991: 94), in modern Turkish gezgin 'wandering', gezen 'rover' (Akdikmen 1986: 146, 455), and in the Chagatai kaz 'to wander' (Németh 1990: 76). Though there is a tendency to avoid drawing a parallel between Kozák and Kazakh, the phonetic similarities can hardly be ignored. Both groups belonged to the same Turkic-speaking people before the Cossacks were Slavonicized. The Turkish language does not differentiate between Kazakh and Cossack calling both Kazak (Akdikmen 1986: 225). KUN Kun [kun]. The Hungarian name for a 'Cumanian', a people of Turkic origin who first invaded Hungary in the 11th Century, but after repeated defeats they sought permission to settle permanently in the country. They completely assimilated with Hungarians within 200 years. Old Hungarian spelling: 1297 Kun; 1331 Kwn. There are two schools of thought about the meaning of Kun, also spelled Kuhn, Kún and Kuun. The prevailing theory is that it originates in the Turkic qu 'pale, yellowish' (Benkő 1967: 667, vol. 2), describing their complexion. An interesting alternative to the color of skin theory is that Cumanians were simply called 'man' in cognate Altaic languages such as kümün in Mongolian. Similarities can also be found in the Uralic languages, for example the Samoyed kum and Komi-Zyrian komi (Németh 1986: 225). KUTI. Kuti [kuti]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a dweller by the kút 'water well'. Similar words are in other agglutinative languages, cf. Estonian kau 'spring, well', Turkish kuyu 'well, pit’. Old Hungarian spellings: 1055 cut, kut; 1206 cuth; 1242 kut; 1277 kuuth; 1487 kwth; 1638 kut. LABDY. Lábdy [la:bdi]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from Lábod, a village in Somogy County. The letter o is omitted by syncopation. The root láb 'foot' is an ancient Magyar word not present in any other language in this form. The place name is given for no obvious reason. Surnames derived from láb were numerous during the Middle Ages in Hungary. For example Aranylábú 'golden feet' (spelled Aranlabov in 1342), Sárlábú 'muddy feet' (spelled Sarlabo in 1465), széplábú 'beautiful feet' (spelled Zeplabo in 1509) (Szamota 1902-1906: 565). LABUDA. Labuda [labuda]. The most probable origin of this name is in ancient Mesopotamia. It was a title and can be segmented into la-bud-a then etymologized with the help of the Sumerian language. The initial element la may be the distorted form of lu

'man, male' (Labat 1948: No. 330), bud is a variant of bad 'bat, scepter, stave' (Waddell 1927: 23), forerunner of the Hungarian bot 'bat'. The word-final element -a is the adjectival suffix still active in medieval Hungary. Meaning of the compound name is 'man with a scepter', i.e. a governor. The title survived in Semitic Akkadian language in the form of labuttu 'governor' (Labat 1948: No. 75). Byzantine sources mention a boebodos 'governor' by the name of Lebedias, the leader of a tribe called sabartoi asphaloi in Asia (Moravcsik 1988: 42). The name, without the Greek ending would be Lebedi, a close resemblance to Labuda. The present-day Buda in Hungary was also a title in antiquity and is derived from the Sumerian bad (Nogrady 1996: 52-55). The governor’s title boebodos may be the distorted spelling of the Hungarian főboda ‘head buda’. See Buda, Boda and Bodo for more detail. LAMOS. Lamos [lamosh]. The name describes a 'hairy' individual. Lam 'hair' is an obsolete Magyar word, not part of present-day vocabulary in that sense. The adjectival suffix -os indicates condition (Benkő 1967: 713, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1324 Lamus; 1585 Lamos. LASZLO. László [la:slo:]. A hybrid name, most likely comprised of the archaic Magyar lac 'outdoors, exterior' and the Sumerian lu 'man' (Labat 1948: No. 330). It denotes an 'outdoors man'. Minor changes in spelling took place over the years from affricate c to fricative sz and from u to ó. Other words in which the element lac survived are lacibetyár 'felon from the wilderness', lacikonyha 'camp kitchen', lacipecsenye 'meat prepared outdoors on a spit'. The Slavonic source Vladislav, favored by Hungarian onomasticians of the Soviet era, is not convincing. Laci ‘from the outdoors’ is the endearing form of László.
Old Hungarian spelling: Lácló; 1256 -lazlo; 1404 Lazlo-; 1546 Laczlo. LEGENY. Legény [lege:nj]. 'Bachelor'. A name of probable Sumerian origin, the compound of lu 'man, male' (Labat 1948: No. 330) and gin 'to come and go, to move and bustle about' (Labat 1948: No. 206). The attribute lugin > legény describes the characteristics of a bachelor. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 -legen; 1152 legun-; 1245 -legen; 1819 legin, leginy. LEHI. Lehi [lehi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Leh, a village in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County, that preserved the name of its founder. Leh is the root of lehel 'exhale', probably bestowed on a person who exhaled in blow-like puffs. Old Hungarian spelling: 1282 Leh; LEHOTAY. Lehotay [lehotai]. The archaic derivational suffix -y signifies a person from a Lehota, a Slovak word meaning 'privilege'. Settlements in the Northern Highlands of historical Hungary (present-day Slovakia), where Slovak settlers received complete freedom from serfage in addition to other privileges, were named Lehota (Németh 1991: 205). LENGYEL Lengyel [lendjel]. 'Polish'. The origin of the name is attributed by some to the Old Russian *lędo 'clearing, virgin soil', but its one-time written existence can only be reconstructed through Byzantine and Arab records (Benkő 1967: 751, vol. 1). A more probable source would be the aphetic form of Polander, after the loss of



68
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
the initial syllable Po which means 'near, beside' in the Slavonic languages. The remaining Lander, after undergoing changes to accommodate the phonetic structure of the Hungarian language, would result in the form Lengyel. Old Hungarian spelling: 1130 Lengen. LEVAI. Lévai [le:vai]. Also spelled Lévay. The name denotes a person from Léva in Trencsén County of historical Hungary, confined to Slovakia in 1920 and renamed Levice. The word-final element -i (archaic -y) is the derivational suffix, indicating origin. The rest of the name is comprised of the root lev and the archaic adjectival suffix a and means 'being, existing'. Its present-day form is lévő. The city probably preserved the name of its founder. Old Hungarian spelling: 1156 Leua; 1350 lev; 1693 livő. LIBA. Liba [liba]. 'Goose'. A goose farmer may have been named so. Liba is an old obscure Hungarian word that contains the root lib and the archaic adjectival suffix -a. Old Hungarian spelling: 1565 liba-; 1833 Riba, libó; luba. LIGETI. Ligeti [ligeti]. Also spelled Ligetti. The derivational suffix -i indicate a dweller by the liget 'grove'. The word liget is comprised of the root lig and the formative -et. Old Hungarian spelling: 1121 -legeth; 1206 ligoth; 1208 liget; 1565 lügget. LIKO. Likó [liko:]. Derived from lik, a regional variant of lyuk 'hole', the name describes one who cuts the rows of holes in the ground with a hoe in which seeds are placed, according to lexical information (B. Lőrinczy 1992: 864, 929, vol. 3). The participle -ó forms action nouns. This occupational name originated in an agricultural society and was first recorded in the southern region of the Carpathian Basin during the 1st Century AD as Licco (Mócsi 1975: 64). LISZT. Liszt [liszt]. An occupation that took its name from the product. The Hungarian liszt 'flour' is most likely derived from the Sumerian liš 'fragment, morsel' . The Middle Babylonian form was lis (Labat 1948: No. 377). Flour is the finely fragmented (milled) kernels of wheat. Cf. Finnish leseet 'bran' and lestyjauhot 'fine flour' (Papp 1978: 356). Old Hungarian spelling: 1279 -lyst; 1415 Lyzth; 1597 lizt; 1646 liszt-. LOKE. Lőke [lø:ke]. A relic from the distant past, a name given for no obvious reason. Its most probable origin is the Sumerian lah 'to shove, to push' (Labat 1948: No. 206a). The word-final element -e is the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a, subjected to vowel harmony. Similar words are in other Finno-Ugric languages, cf. Finnish lykätä 'push', Estonian lükama 'push' (Benkő 1967: 794, vol. 2). LOMBOS. Lombos [lombosh]. Derived from lomb 'foliage', the name may owe its origin to a residence surrounded and concealed by vegetation of dense foliage. The adjectival suffix -os indicates condition. Old Hungarian spelling: 1213 Lomb; 1577 lomb. LOVAGI. Lovagi [lovagi]. Descendant of a lovag 'knight' as marked by the derivational suffix -i. The word lovag is derived from ló 'horse' to which the adjectival suffix -ag is attached. The intermittent v is a connecting consonant. Old Hungarian spelling: 1306 Lwag; 1395 louag; 1414 Lowagh; 1484 Lovag. LOVASZ. Lovász [lova:s]. 'Horse-groom, stableman'. The suffix -ász is a formative that marks specialized occupations. See Lovagi for more detail. Old Hungarian spelling: 1055 luazu; 1193 Loaz; 1233 Luaz; 1236 Lowaz; 1544 louasz-; 1546 lowasz; 1674 Lovász.

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
LUDAS. Ludas [ludash]. The name is comprised of lúd ‘goose' and the adjectival suffix as. It denotes a farmer engaged in the raising and marketing of geese. It also denotes a ‘goose-herd’. Also, a dubious person is called ludas in rural Hungary. Words similar to lúd are in other Finno-Ugric languages, cf. Vogul lont 'goose', lunt 'wild goose', Finnish lintu 'bird', Estonian lind 'bird' (Benkő 1967: 797, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Ludos; 1329 Ludas; 1438 Ludas; 1731 Ludas. LUKAS. Lukas [lukash]. There are two possible origins for this name. One is the altered form of the Latin Lucas derived from luceo 'light, to shine'. But the generally accepted Hungarian version of the Latin word, also a surname, is Lukács. Another possibility is that the name denotes a dweller in a hollow, as luk is a variant of lyuk 'hole'. The adjectival suffix -as would certainly indicate such derivation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1231 Lycos-; 1297 lwkas-; 1307 Lykas; 1329 Lyukas-; 1462 Lykas-; 1521 lukas. LUKO. Lükő [lykø:]. 'Javelin-thrower, slinger (Szamota 1902-1906:598)'. The name contains the root-word lük a variant of lök 'toss, thrust' and the participle -ő which transforms verbs into action nouns. See Loke for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Lukeu; 1436 Lykew; 1504 Lywkew. MACS Mács [ma:ch]. The name has no meaning in present-day Hungarian. It may be the variant of the Sumerian maš 'lamb' (Labat 1048: No. 76). A shepherd or the owner of a heard of sheep may have received the name. Macs is also a place name near Debrecen and were probably given to honor the shepherds and their sheep that lived there. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Moc; 1214 Moch. MACSAI Mácsai [ma:chai]. The derivational suffix -i signifies a descendant of Mácsa. The Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a denotes occupation which is attached to the root macs to denote a ‘shepherd’. See Macs for etymology. MACSO Macsó [macho:]. The participle -ó indicates 'one associated with lambs'. See Macs for etymology. MADA Mada [mada]. The name has no meaning in modern Hungarian. It may be the unchanged form of the Sumerian ma-da 'land, country, region' (Labat 1948: No. 342). The Hungarian equivalent of the Sumerian ma-da is ország and it is also used as a surname. Mada may denote a member of the indigenous people in the Carpathian Basin. MADACH Madách [mada:ch]. The suffix -ch is an altered form of the adjectival suffix -s [-sh] which indicates status. The name appears to denote a landowner. See Mada for etymology. MADACHI Madáchi [mada:chi]. Also spelled Madáchy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) signifies a descendant of Madách the 'landowner'. See Mada and Madách for etymology. MADAI Madai [madai]. Also spelled Maday. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) denotes a resident of the country, i.e. a dweller in the land. See Mada for etymology. MADAS Madas [madash]. The adjectival suffix -s is attached to the Sumerian ma-da 'land, country' to indicate a landowner. The present-day equivalent of Madas is the surname Földes. Föld means 'land' in the current Hungarian language. MADAR Madár [mada:r]. 'Fowler'. An occupational name. The Hungarian madár 'bird' may be derived from the Sumerian mu-ud 'bird' (Deimel 1939: page 10).

Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Modor-; 1360 Madar-; 1602 Madár. MADARAS Madaras [madarash]. Also spelled Madaros, Madarass. The adjectival suffix -as indicates an occupation. The name denotes a person who specialized in breeding birds of any kind, including barnyard and game birds. See Madar for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Modoros; 1337 Madaras-.
MADARASI Madarasi [madarashi]. Also spelled Madarasy, Madarassy, Madarassi. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Madaras. See Madar and Madaras for etymology. MADARASZ Madarász [madara:s]. 'One who traps wild birds'. The name is comprised of madár 'bird' and the formative suffix -ász which converts nouns into names of specialized occupations. See Madar for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1379 Madaraz; 1520 Madaraz; 1522 Madarazs. MAGAS Magas [magash]. The adjectival suffix -as indicates a tall person when attached to the root mag 'tall'. The word mag may be the Hungarian variant of the Sumerian mah 'high, eminent' (Labat 1948: No. 57). Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 mogos; 1211 Mogus; 1240 Mocus; 1370 -magas. MAGYAR Magyar [madjar]. Hungarians call themselves Magyar, but the name cannot be etymologized in their current language. Also spelled Megyer, the name denotes the original inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin (Nogrady 1994: 33-35). Their name received gradual recognition after more than a thousand years of subjugation by Sarmatian, Roman, Hun, Avar, Turkish and Austrian rulers. Other nations call them Hungars, the name of their Turkish speaking Hun-gar ruling class. During that period of time only the native serfs, who vastly outnumbered their foreign rulers, called themselves Magyar. The name is most likely derived from the Sumerian language. The phoneme gy in magy is the palatal counterpart of the alveolar d in the Sumerian ma-da 'land, country, region' (Labat 1948: No. 342). By adding the final syllable er 'servant' (Labat 1948: No. 50), the word ma-da-er is obtained that would correspond to a present-day Hungarian spelling ma-gya-er, meaning 'servant of the land'. The name was then shortened to either Magyar or Megyer, depending on regional dialects. Old Hungarian spelling: 1121 Mogioroi; 1150 -moger; 1200 Mogerij; 1225 Mogor; 1230 Mogior; 1275 Magyar; 1283 Mogyor; 1286 Magor; 1323 Maghor; 1329 Magar; 1333 Magyar. MALO Maló [malo:]. The name may have been bestowed on a person associated with a malom 'flour-mill'. The word-final element -ó is the participle denoting an occupation when attached to a verb. The name is probably derived from the Sumerian ma5 'to mill, to grind' (Labat 1948: No. 33). The l preceding the participle -ó is a connecting consonant. Therefore maló may be the original form of the present-day malom 'mill' and/or molnár 'miller'. Similar words exist in many Indo-European languages which are derived from the Latin molo 'to grind' however, its etymology is obscure. The Hungarian máll 'crumble, disintegrate' may also be associated with the Sumerian and Indo-European terms. MATAI Matai [matai]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant of Mata, which cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. It appears to be a derivation either from the Sumerian ma-da 'land, country, region' (Labat 1948: No. 342),



71
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
or its Akkadian counterpart mâtu which means the same thing. Mata, an altered form of mâtu can be turned into a surname the same as ma-da and both of their meanings compare well with the present-day Hungarian surname Ország 'land, country'. MATOS Matos [matosh]. This name appears to be a more recent variant of Mata. The ancient Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a was replaced by the present-day -os. The name suggests a 'landowner'. MERAI Mérai [me:rai]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from the town of Méra. The toponym, first recorded as Mera in 1256 in Abaúj County (Györffy 1987: 118, vol. 1), was originally the surname of Lord Mera. This surname cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. After separating the Sumero-Hungarian suffix –a from the root of the name, the stem mer or mér remains. The Sumerian mer 'passion, anger' (Labat 1948: No. 347) is also the root word of the Hungarian mérges 'angry'. The archaic adjectival suffix –a was replaced by the present-day -es. Mérges is also a surname in Hungary. The name Mérai therefore denotes the 'descendant of a passionate, hot tempered' person. See Mérges for additional detail. MERGES Mérges [me:rgesh]. An ‘angry, hot tempered’ person is called mérges in Hungary. The name is derived from méreg 'anger, poison' to which the adjectival suffix es is added to indicate one's disposition. The word méreg is of uncertain origin, similar words are in both the Finno-Ugric and Indo-European languages. For example Finn myrrky 'poison', Estonian mürk 'poisonous plant', Indo-Iranian (Ossetic) marg 'poison', Persian marg 'death' (Benkő 1967: 899, vol. 2). However, the much older Sumerian mer 'anger' (Labat 1948: No. 347) is the most probable source of the Hungarian Mérges. See Merai for additional detail. MISKA Miska [mishka]. A probable combination of the Sumerian mí 'female' (Labat 1948: No. 554) and ša5 'to cut' (Labat 1948: No. 97). Misa [misha] may be the original form of Miska that forms the basis of the Hungarian miskárol 'to spay', a process applied to female animals to incapacitate them for producing young. The name denotes the action described by the Sumerian mí-ša5. Misa is now the Hungarian endearing form of Miska. The Slavonic miska 'cup' or miška 'mouse' are unlikely sources. Old Hungarian spelling: 1213 Misca; 1215 Mischa; 1219 Miske; 1221 Myska, Miska. MOLNAR Molnár [molna:r]. 'Miller'. Similar words, having similar meanings as the Hungarian molnár, exist in other languages, cf. Slavonic mlinar, malinar, German Müller, French meunier, Latin molitor. However, the Hungarian molnár appears to be derived from the Sumerian mù, ma5 'to mill, to grind' (Labat 1948: No. 33). See Malo for related information. Old Hungarian spelling: 1330 Molnar; 1403 Monar; 1427 Molnaar; 1632 molnar. MOSO Mosó [mosho:]. 'Launderer'. The participle -ó is attached to mos 'to wash' to indicate a person whose chores include doing the laundry and other related work. The word mos was present in the Akkadian language in the form of mešu 'to wash' (Labat 1948: No. 321). The Sumerian phonetic value of the cuneiform sign for the



72
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Akkadian mešu is luh, which is almost identical with the Hungarian lub, the root of luboz 'whirl or swing in water' and lubickol 'splash'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1269 Musou -; 1323 Mosou -; 1340 Muso; 1487 Moso. MOSOLYGO Mosolygó [moshojgo:]. 'Smiling, jovial'. The participle -ó is affixed to mosolyog 'smile' to form an adjective. The -og segment is the frequentative suffix which is preceded by the nominal suffix -oly. The root mos may be derived from the Sumerian múš 'facial expression' (Labat 1948: No. 102). The root mos is also present in the Uralic languages cf. Vogul mås- 'smile' (Benkő 1967: 294, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1416 Mosolgo. MURAI Murai [murai]. Also spelled Muray. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a dweller by the river Mura. This river flows in between two major watercourses, the Rába and the Dráva. The word-final element -a is most likely the Sumerian and old Hungarian adjectival suffix. Many Hungarian river names end in -a cf. Duna, Tisza, Rábca, Lajta, Száva. Others end in -os which is the present-day adjectival suffix, cf. Szamos, Maros, Kőrös, Kapos. The root mur is a variant of mar ‘corrode, eat away’ present in another river name Maros. It denotes a swift flowing river that erodes the shoreline. The reconstructed Finno-Ugric proto-word is *mura(-) or *murɜ- (Benkő 1967: 841, vol. 2). The speculation that the name may originate from the Lombard mor 'swamp' (Kiss 1978: 435) (cf. German Morast) is not convincing. The misidentification and naming a river as a swamp would constitute a major unawareness of nature, very unlikely of early men who were environmentally well informed. MURAKOZI Muraközi [murakøzi]. Also spelled Muraközy. The name contains the following elements: Mura (see above), köz 'community' and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). The name denotes a person from the community by the river Mura. NACSA Nacsa [nacha]. A relic from the distant past when the Sarmatians of Iranian origin ruled part of the Carpathian Basin c. AD 200-300. Nacsa may be derived from the East Iranian naša 'settlement, camp' (Németh 1986: VI, in foreword by János Harmatta). The name may denote a new settler. A servant named Nasa [nasha] was recorded in 1138 by the provost of Dömös in Komárom County (Fehértói 1983: 247). NAD Nád [na:d]. 'Reed'. A dweller by a reedy marsh may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1282 Nad-; 1482 Nadh-; 1697 Nád. NADAI Nádai [na:dai] Also spelled Náday. The name is comprised of nád 'reed', the archaic Hungarian adjectival suffix -a (same as the Sumerian -a) and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). It denotes the descendant of a dweller by a reedy marsh. NADANYI Nadányi [nada:nji]. A person from Nadány was named so as indicated by the derivational suffix -i. The name of present-day Kőrösladány in Békés County was called Nadan in 1222. This name appears to be of Iranian origin, probably given by the Sarmatians and slightly modified by the indigenous Magyars. The word nadan means 'ignorant' in the Persian language (Lambton 1988: 164). NADAS Nádas [na:dash]. A trade name denoting a reed-worker such as maker of reed roofs or a seller of bundled reed. The adjectival suffix -as indicates occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1259 Nados-; 1269 Nadas. NADASDI Nádasdi [na:dashdi]. Also spelled Nádasdy. The derivational suffix -i



73
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
(archaic -y) indicates a person from Nádasd a place in Vas County. The -d ending in Hungarian toponyms marks a place. The rest of the name is comprised of nád 'reed' and the adjectival suffix -as to indicate the prevailing vegetation in the area. Old Hungarian spelling: 1223 Nadost; 1244 Nadasd. NADOR Nádor [na:dor]. 'Viceroy'. There are three potential origins for this name, all of them from the area of ancient Mesopotamia. 1. Translation of the Sumerian title en-gi (en 'lord' gi 'reed') 'lord of the reeds', Hungarian nád 'reed' and úr 'lord'. 2. A variant of the Sumerian nigir 'steward of the palace' (Labat 1948: No. 348). 3. Derivation from the Persian nazer 'overseer, bailiff' which is a loan word from Arabic (Lambton 1988: 165). Old Hungarian spelling: 1504 Nadr-; 1554 nador-. NADORFI Nádorfi [na:dorfi]. The patronymic suffix -fi indicates a male descendant of Nádor. NADORI Nádori [na:dori]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant of Nádor. NAGY Nagy [nadj]. The Hungarian nagy 'large, big, important' may be either derived from the Sumerian [nu]g 'large, big' (Labat 1948: No. 72) or the also Sumerian na 'important' (Deimel 1939: No. 45). Old Hungarian spelling: 1055 nogu; 1199 Nogy; 1272 Nog-; 1326 Nogh; 1421 Nag; 1478 Nagh; 1448 nagy. NAGYFALUSI Nagyfalusi [nadjfalushi]. The name denotes a person from a 'big village'. It is comprised of nagy 'big', falu 'village', the adjectival suffix -s and the derivational suffix -i. See Nagy for etymology. The word falu is present in languages of the Uralic language family. The reconstructed Finno-Ugric proto-word is *palyɜ (Benkő 1967: 836, vol. 1). However, the Hungarian falu may have evolved from the Sumerian uru 'village' pronounced alu during the Neo-Babylonian period (Labat 1967: No. 38). NAGYFURO Nagyfúró [nadjfu:ro:]. 'Great borer'. The name distinguishes a skilled maker of holes from an average one. It contains the word nagy 'great', fúr 'to bore, to drill' and the participle -ó which forms adjectives from verbs to mark an occupation. See Nagy for etymology. The Hungarian fúr may be derived from the Sumerian bùr 'to bore, to drill' (Labat 1948: No. 411). A sound change from b to f is a recorded occurrence in the Hungarian language, cf. bodor > fodor 'curl, frill'. NAGYGYOR Nagygyőr [nadjdjø:r]. A difficult name to etymologize. The first segment nagy means 'big, great', see Nagy for etymology. The second segment Győr is the name of a city known for metallifacture and is also part of Diósgyőr, the name of another city having metallurgic industries. There is a strong possibility that the Hungarian győr is cognate with the also Hungarian gyűr, gyúr 'mould, knead' and is related to the Sumerian gur. Gur, when reduplicated as gur-gur, means 'craftsman who works with metal' (Labat 1948: No. 111) clearly shows relationship with metallurgy. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language indicates the correlation between gyűr and gyúr (Benkő 1967: 1140, vol. 1). The phonetic difference is almost negligible between győr and gyűr. Albeit no known written record of the Hungarian vasgyúró 'iron-moulder' exist in the sense of 'metal-worker' or 'smith', it has been recorded in 1429 as 'strong, muscular



74
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
man' (Benkő 1967: 1096, vol. 3). Back then the strongest man in a community was the black-smith by virtue of his work and he did bend, mould and hammer metals into desired shapes. Therefore we cannot be indifferent to the possibility that the original meaning of vasgyúró was 'black-smith'. Taking all this into consideration the most probable meaning of Nagygyőr is 'prominent metal worker'. Old Hungarian spelling of Győr: 1213 Jewr; 1221 Geur. NAMATH Namath [ne:met]. Anglicized form of Németh 'German'. See below for etymology. NANAI Nánai [na:nai]. Also spelled Nánay. A person from the village of Nána would be called so as indicated by the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). The village is in the former Hungarian Northern Highland, confined to Slovakia in 1920. The element -nána is part of toponyms in present-day Hungary cf. Alsónána, Bakonynána, Felsőnána, Kisnána, Tiszanána in Tolna, Veszprém and Heves Counties. The name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language or in the Slavonic languages. It may be derived from the Sumerian nun 'prince' (Labat 1948: No. 87). The pre-Semitic Sumerian name of Babylon was Nun-ki 'prince's place'. Nána may have been the property of a prince in antiquity. The word-final element -a is the Sumerian adjectival suffix marking the status of the village. Old Hungarian spelling: 1055 Nane; 1121 Nana; 1488 Nana. NANASI Nánási [na:na:shi]. Also spelled Nánásy. More recent equivalent of the older Nánai where the adjectival suffix -ás replaced the ancient -a. See Nanai for more detail. NAP Nap [nap]. A surname given for no obvious reason. Nap has a dual meaning in the Hungarian language: 'sun' and 'day'. The Sumerians also used one cuneiform sign for sun and day, only the pronunciation differed slightly: utu 'sun' and ud 'day' (Labat 1948: No. 380). The Sumerian word for 'planet, star' and 'to shine' is nap (Labat 1948: No. 129a), same phonetic form as the Hungarian nap ‘sun’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1195 nop-; 1246 Nap; NEDOBA Nedoba [nedoba]. A name of Slovakian origin derived from nádoba 'dish, cooking utensil'. A maker or seller of such items may have been named so. NEGYESI Négyesi [ne:djeshi]. Also spelled Négyessy. The fourth child in a family may have been named Négyes, comprised of négy 'four' and the adjectival suffix -es that denotes position. The -i (archaic -y) ending is the derivational suffix, thus Négyesi means 'descendant of the fourth child'. Négy is present in most Finno-Ugric languages in similar forms, cf. Finnish neljä, Estonian neli (Benkő 1967: 1007, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1131 Negus; 1277 Neges; 1396 Negess-; 1462 Negyes-. NEHEZ Nehéz [nehe:z]. The exact meaning of the word nehéz is 'heavy' but it is also used for identifying a difficult situation (nehéz helyzet) or person (nehéz ember). Old Hungarian spelling: 1367 Nehez; 1505 Nehez. NEMA Néma [ne:ma]. 'Mute'. The prevailing theory is that the Hungarian néma is derived from the Slavonic nêm, néma, némo 'mute' but its origin is uncertain. It may be possible that néma has evolved from the Sumerian nu-eme comprised of nu (Labat 1948: No. 75), a negation which may be translated as 'without' identical to the Hungarian ne, nem 'no, not' and eme 'language' (Labat 1948: No. 32). The meaning of the



75
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
compound nu-eme would then be 'no language' or 'without language', i. e. ‘mute’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1226 Nema; 1477 Nema. NEMES Nemes [nemesh]. The name indicates the social standing of being noble by birth, rank, excellence or worth. It is derived from nem 'genus, family' which has accompanied the names of prominent Hungarian families since the earliest times of their history. For example the Bor-Kalán nem. Descendants of those families automatically belonged to the nobility and were referred to as nemes, along with those who were elevated to this rank by decree. The word-final element -es is the adjectival suffix. Nemes is a recently coined surname by comparison and prevails only among common people, although some families having this name could have belonged to the nobility but were stripped of their title during the country's turbulent history. The word nemzet 'nation' is also derived from nem. The name and the title may be derived from the Sumerian nam 'genus, family' (Gostony 1975: 14), or nu, numun 'descendants' (Labat 1948: No 72). Old Hungarian spelling: 1231 Numus; 1347 Nemus; 1354 Nemes. NEMETH Németh [ne:met]. A German is called Német in the Hungarian language. The word-final element h marks the reduced plosion of the preceding t. The precise origin of the name is uncertain and its etymology is obscure. The prevalent proposal, listed in the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, suggests a Slavonic origin from nemec 'foreigner' or nemi 'dumb' (Benkő 1967: 1011, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1130 Nemti; 1211 Nimed; 1219 Nemeth; 1372 nemet. The problem with the Slavonic source is that the name was in use long before the status of those languages advanced to a position where they could exert their influence on non-Slavic people. For example, the existence of a Celtic tribe called Nemet is substantiated by coins unearthed in the area what the Romans later called Noricum. The Celtic inhabitants were conquered by Roman Emperor Augustus. Also, Tacitus (c. AD 56-120) mentioned a German tribe called Nemetas, who occupied the left bank of the Rhine in around AD 50 in the area of present-day Worms and Speyer (Furneaux 1907: 93). In line with this, the people of Northern Germany are always referred to as Német by old Hungarian chroniclers, while the population of Austria and Bavaria are constantly called Bavarii in Latin language chronicles (Bajor in Hungarian). This evidence indicates that the ancient form was better preserved in the Hungarian language than in any of the Slavonic languages. This leaves in doubt that Német is a Slavonic loan word in the Hungarian language. German immigration to Hungary is recorded as early as the beginning of the second millennium AD. The intermarriages between Hungarian and German nobility caused a migration of servants in both directions. The German squires and high ranking priests preferred to bring their German speaking servants and workers to the new country. This first wave of immigrants thus consisted mostly of peasants and farmhands. The Germans, at the beginning, have settled exclusively on crown lands in isolated communities and were granted special privileges. Considering the selfsupporting way of life in those days, a body of people like that, could exist for a long period of time without being exposed to the language and culture of the host country.



76

The second wave of Germans arrived following the Mongol devastation of Hungary in 1241. A large number of them were from Bavaria and they settled in Vas and Sopron counties. After Hungary became part of the Habsburg Empire, German speaking Roman Catholics migrated to Hungary en masse to fill the vacancy created by the Turkish genocide. The Austrian authorities did not allow Hungarians to repopulate the areas devastated by the Turks (Ács 1986: 36, 70, 163, 171). NINACS Ninács [nina:ch]. The name cannot be etymologized entirely in the Hungarian language. The initial element Nin is identical with the Sumerian nin 'lady' (Labat 1948: No. 556) which is present in the Hungarian language in the form of nén, néni 'older sister, dame'. The second element ács means 'carpenter' as an independent word, but in this case it appears to be an altered form of the adjectival suffix -ás. The name would then mean 'lady-like'. NEZO Néző [ne:zø:]. The literal translation of this name is 'onlooker, observer' but also denoted a medicine man in rural Hungary (B. Lőrinczy 2002: 70, vol. 4), one who can heal and see into the future. The name is comprised of néz 'look' and the participle -ő. Similar words exist in other Finno-Ugric languages, cf. Finnish nähdä, (näen) (Benkő 1967: 1017, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1426 -nezew; 1564 níző. NOGRADI Nógrádi [no:gra:di]. Also spelled Nógrády and Neógrády. The name is comprised of nog, the archaic spelling of the present-day nagy 'large, big and important’, see Nagy for etymology. The second element rád (the name of an old Hungarian clan) is a toponym in itself and part of numerous other toponyms in the Carpathian Basin. The word-final element -i (archaic -y) is the derivational suffix indicating origin. Rad means 'canal' in the Middle-Babylonian dialect, the equivalent of the Sumerian šita (Labat 1948: No. 83) whose phonetic value is similar to the Hungarian csatorna 'canal'. Taking all these into consideration, it may be that the Rád clan had a leading role in building canals for irrigation and ditches for draining swamps. Remnants of an ancient drainage and dike system extending in the easterly direction from Budapest to Ungvár and down south to Versec in the Lower-Danube area of historical Hungary is still detectable (Bakai 1997: 187, vol. 1). The city of Nógrád, and the County named after it, was probably the homeland of the dominant Rád clan, thus the qualifier nog. A person from Nógrád is called Nógrádi. The Slavonic source of Novi Grad, Novograd 'new fort' is doubtful. However, this origin was propagated by Hungarian linguists of Slavic descent and some families modified their name to Neogrady in an attempt to link their name to the Greek instead of the Slavonic languages. Neos means 'new' in Greek, the same as nov, novi, etc. means 'new' in the Slavonic languages. Cf. Latin novus 'new'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Naugrad; 1211 Neugrad; 1440 Nougrod. NYAKAS Nyakas [njakash]. 'Stubborn'. The name contains nyak 'neck' and the adjectival suffix -as. The exact translation is 'one who has a neck' but metaphorically used to denote a stubborn individual. Old Hungarian spelling: 1312 Nakas; 1319 Nyakas. NYARI Nyári [nja:ri]. Also spelled Nyáry. 'Summery'. A seasonal-name given to a person born in the 'summer'. The meaning of nyár is 'summer'. The word-final element -i



77
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
(archaic -y) is the derivational suffix. Old Hungarian spelling: 1398 -nyar-; 1416 nar-; 1645 nyári. NYARS Nyárs [nja:rsh]. 'Skewer'. Metaphorical name of a cook who roasts meat on a spit over open fire. Old Hungarian spelling: 1395 nÿas; 1558 nars. NYEKI Nyéki [nje:ki]. A dweller in a fenced place. The closest English term would be 'one who lives in a gated community'. Nyék is an obsolete word for 'fence' (Benkő 1967: 1039, vol. 2) to which the derivational suffix -i is attached. Nyék is also an ancient Hungarian tribal name probably of Finno-Ugric origin, thus Nyéki would denote a person from that tribe. Old Hungarian spelling: 1113 Nec; 1138 Neku; 1165 Nichw. NYERGES Nyerges [njergesh]. The name is comprised of nyereg 'saddle' and the adjectival suffix -es, it denotes a maker or seller of saddles. The reconstructed FinnoUgric proto-word may have been *närkɜ (Benkő 1967: 1039, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1227 Nerges; 1359 Nyerges NYERS Nyers [njersh]. 'Raw'. Metaphor for a ‘blunt person’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1395 Ners-; 1475 Nyers. NYILAS Nyilas [njilash]. 'Archer'. An expert in using bow and arrow or a maker of them may have been named so. The reconstructed Finno-Ugric proto-word may have been *ńole (Benkő 1967: 1045, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1359 Nylas; 1423 Nilas; 1464 Nylyas; 1671 nyilas. NYIRO Nyírő [nji:rø:]. Obsolete Hungarian word for 'barber'. The name is derived from nyír 'to cut, clip, trim' to which the participle -ő is suffixed. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Nereh; 1423 Nyrew; 1507 Nyerew; 1545 nirö-; 1584 Nyrö; 1597 Nyreö; 1602 Nyirő. NYITRAI Nyitrai [njitrai]. Also spelled Nyitray. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Nyitra, a city in historical Hungary, confined to Slovakia and renamed Nitra. The adjacent river is also called Nyitra. The name is of uncertain derivation. Hungarian sources suggest the hypothesized proto-word *Nitrahwa derived from the old German *nid 'flow' and the Gothic *alva 'water' (Kiss 1978: 475). Another possible source may be the Greek nitria 'a place where potash is mined, an alkali field'. The Greek connection is supported by the city's name recorded as Nitria in old documents until 1328 and part of the population is listed as Káliz (Györffy 1998: 429-436, vol. 4), the name of Turkish speaking Mohammedans. NYOMARKAI Nyomárkai [njoma:rkai]. A dweller by the nyomárok may have received this name. The word is compounded from nyom 'trail track' and árok 'ditch' describing a traveled path in a natural or man-made depression. The derivational suffix -i marks origin. A dweller by such a geographical feature may have been named so. NYUL Nyúl [nju:l]. 'Hare, rabbit'. Metaphorical name for a 'fast' or 'timid' person, a perceived characteristic of a hare. Old Hungarian spelling: 1130 Nulu; 1237 Nul. OBAJT Obajt [obajt]. A difficult name to etymologize. Probably related to jobbágy 'serf' which appears to be a distorted hybrid fit together from various sources. One of the sources are the Arabic ubajd 'servant of lower rank' the diminutive of abd 'male servant'

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
(Ahmed 2001: 3, 214). See Jobbágy for more information. OBBAGY Obbágy [oba:dj]. A name cognate with Obajt and Jobbágy. See above for explanation. OBESTER Óbester [o:beshter]. A derivation from the German obersten 'colonel'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1707 óbester-; 1742 Obriszter; 1788 Óbester. OCSAI Ócsai [o:chai]. A person from the village of Ócsa in Pest County. The initial ó means 'old, ancient' in the Hungarian language. The element csa may be derived from the Old Akkadian ša17 'pasture-land' (Labat 1948: No. 318). The same cuneiform sign was later pronounced ritu which is almost identical with the Hungarian rét 'pasture-land'. The meaning of Ócsa, therefore, would be 'old pasture-land'. The word-final element -i is the derivational suffix. A dweller by such a place would be called so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1243 Olsa; 1244 Olcha; 1294 Olza, Ozla; 1332 Ócsa. OCSENY Őcsény [ø:che:nj]. The name pertains to öcs 'younger brother' to which the nominal suffix -ény is attached. A village in Tolna County is called Őcsény. The word öcs is present in the Uralic and Altaic languages in similar phonetic form and identical meaning. The reconstructed Finno-Ugric proto-word is *ećɜ. The old Turkish içi 'younger brother' (Németh 1990: 267) is also part of this etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 wch-; 1284 Euch-; 1492 ewch-. ODON Ödön [ødøn]. A probable variant of the Sumerian udun 'stove, oven' (Deimel 1939: No. 249). A maker of ovens may have received the name. According to another interpretation, Ödön is the distorted form of Eugene, a compound of two Greek words: eu 'good, well' and genes 'born'. The science of eugenics is devoted to the improvement of children. Old Hungarian spelling: 1453 Ewden. OHEGYI Óhegyi [o:hedji]. Comprised of ó 'old ancient', hegy 'mountain' and the derivational suffix -i. A dweller by the Óhegy 'ancient mountain' may have been named so. OKROS Ökrös [økrøsh]. A keeper of oxen for use in agriculture may have received the name. It is comprised of ökör 'ox' and the adjectival suffix -ös. The ö in the middle was omitted by syncopation. The Hungarian ökör is derived from the Turkish öküz (Benkő 1967: 23, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1344 Vkrus; 1350 Wkrus. OLAH Oláh [ola:]. The Hungarian name for a Romanian. The name was applied originally to the inhabitants of Wallachia, a former principality between the southern slopes of the Transylvanian Alps and the Danube River. When Walachia united with Moldavia in 1861, the new country became Romania, a name chosen to emphasize their linguistic ties with the Romans and the Latin language. Hungarians, perplexed by the choice of name, continued to use the term Oláh in order to maintain the separate identity of Transylvanian Gypsies, who always called themselves Rom and their language Romany.
The movements of Oláhs to Hungarian Transylvania was not part of any official immigration process. They have begun to cross into Hungary uninvited, one by one at the end of the 12th century according to contemporary documents. Due to their astoundingly high birth rate, they outnumbered every other ethnic group by the mid-18th century in some areas, including the indigenous Hungarian Székelys (Ács 1986: 95, 152).



79
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Walach, the original name of the Romanians, is derived from the same root as the English Walloon and Welsh (Onions 1985), German Wallone, French wallon (Eckhard 1984: 1987) and the Latin volcae (Györkössy 1986: 603), all of which originally denoted Celtic tribes. The term is now also used for identifying foreigners, mostly speakers of the Romance languages, e.g. the German welsch 'foreigner' (Halász 1983: 2181, vol. 2). The name probably found its way to Hungary in the written form Vlah pronounced [ula:]. One should note that the grapheme v also represented the sound [u] in early Latin scripts. Contributing to the confusion is the misleading name of the Blaks, also known as Ulaks (Györffy 1987: 448, vol. 2), a people of Turkic origin who lived in the vicinity of the Walachians. Whatever the case is, the initial [u] changed to [o] and Hungarians have been retaining this form to the present day. Old Hungarian spelling: 1283 Olah; 1398 Holah; 1602 Olá. Another name derived from the same root is Olasz 'Italian', which also denotes Celts, the pre-Roman population of northern Italy, and reflects an obvious misconception about the identity of the population further south. Old Hungarian spelling: 1181 Uloz; 1257 Oloz; 1284 Olus; 1449 Olaz; 1545 Olasz. The Hungarian forename Ulászló contains the element Ulasz, the forerunner of Olasz to which ló, a derivation from the Sumerian lu 'man' (Labat 1948: No. 330) is attached to denote an 'Italian man'. Referring to Romanians and Italians as Celts is by no means unique to Hungarians. The popular Polish term for Romania is Woɫochi and the Poles still call Italy Wɫochy.
OLAJOS Olajos [olajosh]. The adjectival suffix -os attached to olaj 'oil' marks a maker or seller of cooking oil. The Hungarian Olaj is derived from the Latin oleum 'oil'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1419 Olayos; 1460 Olayws; 1522 Olayos; 1714 Olajos. OLDAL Oldal [oldal]. A dweller on the side of a settlement may have been called Oldal 'side'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1347 oldol-; 1422 -oldal. OLYVES Ölyves [øjvesh]. The adjectival suffix -es attached to ölyv 'hawk' indicates a keeper or trainer of hawks. The Hungarian ölyv is probably derived from the Turkic *elige or *iläy (Benkő 1967: 26, vol. 3). The modern Turkish word for hawk atmaca shows no resemblance to the reconstructed (*) forms. Old Hungarian spelling: 1093 Vlues-; 1055 uluues; 1211 Wlues; 1434 Ewlwes; 1449 Ewlywes; 1602 Ölyves. ONODI Onódi [ono:di]. Also spelled Onódy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Onód, a town in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. The root ono has no meaning in the Hungarian language, it may be a variant of the Sumerian unu 'dwelling, residence' (Labat 1948: No. 195) to which the grammatical designator -d is suffixed to denote a place. The same cuneiform sign pronounced unug was used for writing the name of the Sumerian city Uruk, accompanied by ki 'place' (Unug-ki). Old Hungarian spelling of Onód: 1296 Olnod; 1211 Vnud. OR Őr [ø:r]. The Hungarian őr 'guard' appears to be a derivation of the Sumerian urù 'to



80

guard' (Labat 1948: No. 331). Old Hungarian spelling: 1221 Euru; 1251 Eur;1355 Ewr; 1377 Or-; 1461 Ewr-. ORBAN Orbán [orba:n]. Also spelled Urbán. The name is derived from the Latin urbanus 'city dweller'. Orbán was first a forename given in memory of Pope Orban (died in 230), but later became a surname. It was spelled Vrbanus and Wrbanus in 1211, 1213 and 1550. ORDAS Ordas [ordash]. 'Wolf'. See Farkas for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1239 Wrdas, 1334 Ordos; 1338 Ordas. ORDOG Ördög [ørdøg]. 'Devil'. An unusual surname, may have been bestowed on a person acting the part of a devil at folk festivals. The word may originate in the Sumerian language, cf. udug 'devil, demon' (Labat 1948: No. 557). An unexplored etymology of the Hungarian ördög may be őr-dög 'deceased guardian', i.e. the spirit of a deceased individual that protects a living person. The equivalent of the present-day őr-angyal 'guardian angel'. The Hungarian őr 'guard' was spelled Euru in a 1221 place name, a form almost identical with the Sumerian urù 'to guard'. See Or above. The word dög is present in the surname Dugus, where the word-final element -us is the adjectival suffix. This would make an early form of uru-dug possible. The lexical item dög is now associated with dead bodies of animals and anything bad that should be avoided. However, it denoted a dead person in antiquity (B. Lőrinczy 1979: 1011, vol. 1). Taking all these into consideration, the ördög may have been a benevolent spirit until it became the representative of sin and wrongdoing. Hungarians still say ördögöm van 'I have a devil' when luck strikes them. (This concept was first explored by Zoltán T. Forray, president of Sándor Kőrösi Csoma Historical Society, Toronto). The semantic shift may have occurred at the time of change in religious beliefs. Old Hungarian spelling: 1075 orduk; 1270 wrdug; 1422 Ewrdegh; 1560 Ördög-. OREG Öreg [øreg]. The primary meaning of öreg is 'old, aged' but a person who spent a long time in one kind of activity or was the resident of the same home for an extended period of time is also said to be 'old at it'. As a name Öreg may denote a reliable, experienced person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1473 Oregh; 1516 ewregh; 1542 ereeg; 1544 öreg. ORI Őri [ø:ri]. Also spelled Őry. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) attached to őr 'guard' indicates a descendant of a watchman or member of a security organization. The most probable source of the Hungarian őr is the Sumerian urù, see Or above for detailed explanation. ORLEI Őrlei [ø:lei]. Also spelled Őrley. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Őrlő 'grinder, miller'. The Hungarian őr(-öl) 'to grind, to mill' may be related to the Sumerian ar, arà 'to grind, to mill' (Labat 1948: No. 401). The name is comprised of őr, the connecting consonant l and the participle -e. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language lists Turkic sources for the root őr, cf. Uighur ävir 'turn, rotate', Osmanli evir- 'turn', etc. The act of rotation, the ancient way of grinding with rotating a stone may have initiated the term for 'grind' and 'mill' (Benkő 1967: 36, vol. 3). However, the Sumerian ar, arà are phonetically and semantically closer to the Hungarian őr than the Turkic words. ORMANDI Ormándi [orma:ndi]. Also spelled Ormándy. This name is derived from the



81
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Turkish orman 'forest' and denotes a forest dweller. The suffix -d indicates a place and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) marks place of origin. Old Hungarian spelling: 1130 Vrmandi, 1202 Orman, Vrman. ORMAI Ormai [ormai]. Also spelled Ormay. A difficult name to etymologize. It may mean a person who has a prominent nose. Orr means 'nose' but it also means any protruding object including a mountain peak. In most cases the peak of a mountain is referred to as orom. What makes this name unusual is the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a that indicates condition. The suffix would be appropriate for a person with protruding nose. The word-final element -i (archaic -y) signifies a descendant of Orma (Ormos in modern Hungarian). OROSZ Orosz [oros]. 'Russian'. The name may be derived from the Finnish ruots (archaic rus) which means 'Swedish' and was given to the Varangians who crossed Finland on their way to establish a colony south of Lake Ladoga at Novgorod and Kiyiv (Kiev). However, some onomasticians derive the name from ruotsi 'rowers', name of the Swedish oarsmen serving on Viking ships. Russ remains the basis of the name in most Indo-European languages. The Uralic and Altaic language groups prefer to have the vowel o or u in front of the initial r. Early Hungarians did not differentiate between Russians and the Ukrainians of Galicia, though they called Ukrainians Kisorosz 'Lesser-Russian'. People from Galicia began entering Hungary in the 13th century. They settled in small groups in the sparsely populated mountainous regions of Máramaros, Bereg, Ung and Zemplén Counties. Earlier presence of people from Galicia may be attributed to volunteer service in the Hungarian king's army. Large waves of refugees arrived in Hungary during the 17th century escaping the tyranny of their landlords (Ács 1986: 101). Old Hungarian spelling: 1130 Uruz-; 1211 Vros; 1280 Wrz; 1295 Oroz. OROSZLAN Oroszlán [orosla:n]. 'Lion'. A brave man may have been named so. The name is derived from the Turkish arslan, aslan 'lion'. Hungarian linguists trace it to the hypothetical *arsilan and link it to the color 'reddish-yellow' . Old Hungarian spelling: 1247 Wruzlan-; 1256 Orozlan-; 1260 Oruslan-; 1754 Oroszlyán-; 1774 Oroszleány-; 1889 araszliány. ORS Örs [ørsh]. The exact Hungarian meaning of örs is 'a group of soldiers allocated to provide sentinels for guarding a place'. It is an inappropriate name for an individual. A more likely source is the Turkish örs [ørs] 'anvil', a personal name that has its equivalent in the Hungarian surname Üllő 'anvil'. ORSA Orsa [orsha]. The archaic rendition of Orsós 'maker or seller of spindles', derived from ors 'spindle' to which the archaic adjectival suffix -a is attached. Similar words exist in some of the Turkic languages having the same meaning, cf. Tatar orčïg, Bashkir orsoq, Uighur urćuk (Benkő 1967: 1095, vol. 2). Old Hungarian spelling: 1339 Orsus-; 1638 orsos. ORSOS Orsós [orsho:sh]. Modern form of Orsa, the present-day adjectival suffix -os replaced the archaic -a. See above for more information. ORSZAGH Országh [orsa:g]. The word-final element -h marks the reduced plosion of the preceding g. There are several possible etymologies for this surname and they all lead to the Sumerian language. While uru means 'city, circle' (Labat 1948: No. 38) and zag means



82
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
'territory' (Labat 1948: No. 332), the compound uru-zag can be interpreted as ország 'country' (Gostony 1975: 60). The remnants of large circular earthworks that served as fortifications are still visible throughout the Carpathian Basin. They were still in use during the Avar era (c. AD 670-896) and seem to fit Labat's interpretation of the cuneiform sign for 'city, circle'. An equally plausible etymology is the combination of the Sumerian uru 'man, hero' (Labat 1948: No. 575) and sag 'land' (Deimel 1939: 94). The combined meaning would be 'land of man' or 'land of heroes'. Another approach would be the Sumerian hursag 'mountain, highland' (Gostony 1975: 60). All three etymologies are very close to the phonetic value and meaning of the Hungarian ország ‘country, land’. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language derives ország from uru, the forerunner of the present-day úr 'lord', and -szág [sa:g] a version of the nominal suffix -ság [sha:g]. It suggests that ország 'country' is a variant of uraság 'squire, nobleman' (Benkő 1967: 1095, vol. 2). For úr the dictionary suggests a relationship with the Finnish uros 'adult man, hero', which appears to be a variant of the Sumerian uru 'man, hero' listed above. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Vrzac; 1423 Orzag; 1427 Orzaag; 1436 Orzagh; 1728 ország. ORVOS Orvos [orvosh]. 'Medical practitioner'. A name of uncertain derivation according to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language. One possible origin would be Finno-Ugric, cf. Finnish arpa 'fate, magic wand'. The other possibility is Old Turkic, cf. Uighur arwïš 'magic formula' (Benkő 1967: 1097, vol. 2). Both of these explanations indicate someone with magical powers, therefore the potentiality of a Sumerian source cannot be disregarded. The Sumerian ur5(-us) mean 'oracle' (Labat 1948: No. 401) which may be interpreted as 'an uncommonly wise person whose opinion is not disputed'. A medicine man would fit into that category. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Vruus; 1457 Orwos; 1522 Wrwos. OSKU Őskű [ø:shky:]. A person from Őskű, a village in Veszprém County, may have been called so. The village's name is compounded from ős 'very old, ancient, ancestor' and kű the old form of the present-day kő 'stone'. Ős is derived from the Sumerian úš 'ancestry' (Labat 1948: No. 69) and kő is present in the Finno-Ugric languages in various forms. The reconstructed proto-word is *kiße. However, the Sumerian cuneiform sign for ku 'to lay foundation' means 'foundation' when pronounced dúr, but dúr-mi-na means 'stone' (Labat 1948: No. 536). There seem to be a mismatch in the dictionary between phonetic values and meanings. Old Hungarian spelling: 1461 Ewskew. OSZ Ősz [ø:s]. 'Fall, Autumn'. One born in the fall may have been named so. The word ősz seems to be genuinely Hungarian. The Finno-Ugric proto-word *sikśe, listed in the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, appears to be farfetched. Old Hungarian spelling: 1100 -euz; 1416 oz-; 1456 ez-; 1541 ész-, üsz; 1783 ősz-. OTVOS Ötvös [øtvøsh]. 'Goldsmith, silversmith'. The initial element öt is the archaic form of the present-day önt 'cast', which is followed by the connecting consonant v and



83
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
the adjectival suffix -ös that indicates occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1389 Wthwes; 1442 Ewthwes; 1455 Ewthues; 1463 Etwes; 1578 Eothveos; 1602 Eötves. OZ Őz [ø:z]. 'Deer'. An intriguing name for a person, unless one is a gamekeeper. The semblance between the Hungarian őz 'deer' and the Sumerian ùz 'goat' (Labat 1948: No. 122b) is so close that a misidentification cannot be dismissed. The old Hungarian spelling of őz would substantiate this possibility: 1138 Euz; 1330 wz; 1714 űz. OZVEGY Özvegy [øzvedj]. 'Widow(-er). A genuine Hungarian name absent in other languages. Old Hungarian spelling: 1302 Wzwegh; 1560 Oszűegh; 1790 Özvögy. PAAL Paál [pa:l]. Has no meaning in the current Hungarian language. Pa-al means 'temple administrator' (Deimel 1939: No. 169) in the Sumerian language. PAIZS Paizs [paizh]. Also spelled Pais. Archaic form of the present-day pajzs 'shield'. A maker of shields would have received such a name. The Hungarian pajzs is derived from the Italian pavese, the name of a special type of shield made in Pavia (Benkő 1967: 61, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Poiais; 1384 pajs; 1522 pais-; 1603 Pajs-. PAJTAS Pajtás [pajtash]. 'Pal, mate'. A probable derivation from the Turkish pay 'share, portion', paydaş 'shareholder'. The original Hungarian meaning of pajtás may have been friends who give and receive equally or share in good or bad. Old Hungarian spelling: 1363 Paytas-; 1597 paitas. PALA Pala [pala]. 'Slate'. A worker skilled in splitting blocks of slate into plates may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1717 pala. PALANKAI Palánkai [pala:nkai]. The name is comprised of the word palánk 'palisade', the archaic adjectival suffix -a and the derivational suffix -i. It indicates the descendant of a dweller within the palánk, a kind of fortification or fence consisting of a row of upright posts set firmly in the ground. The origin of the word palánk is unclear, cf. French palanque, German planken. A similar word was used in ancient Mesopotamia. The Sumerian gišbulug and the Akkadian palukku are both identified as a 'cane commune' (Labat 1948: No. 96). What makes this interpretation questionable is the qualifier giš which means 'wood, log' (Labat 1948: No. 96). Therefore, the cuneiform sign may have indicated a community surrounded by a palánk made of posts. Old Hungarian spelling: 1564 palank-. PALCZA Pálcza [pa:ltsa]. 'Stick, rod'. The word has no probable reason in the Hungarian language to form a surname. It is identical with the Slavonic palica 'stick, rod'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1452 Palcza. PALFI Pálfi [pa:lfi]. Also spelled Pálfy, Pálffy. The patronymic suffix -i indicates a descendant of Pál, a name cognate with Paál. Hungarian sources identify Pál with the Latin Paulus 'little, short' (Ladó 1978: 202). But a Mesopotamian origin is more likely. See Paal for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1358 Palfy-; 1359 Pal. PALLO Palló [palo:] A thick board or plank is called palló. A maker or seller of planks may have been named so. The reduplicated l marks a stressed consonant. The participle



84
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
ó is usually suffixed to verbs which would suggest that pal was once a verb. Old Hungarian spelling: 1512 pallo; 1546 palo. PALOC Palóc [palo:ts]. Also spelled Palócz. No satisfactory etymology has been advanced for the origin of this name. One explanation is the Slavonic plavec, polovec 'Cumanian'(Györfy 1990: 319, vol. 3), based entirely on phonetic resemblance and anecdotal evidence. Cumanians never lived in the area populated by the Palóc group at the junction of Heves, Borsod and Gömör counties of historical Hungary. Most of this area is now in Slovakia but there are no place names indicating their presence in that region. Old Hungarian spelling: 1220 Polouc; 1656 palócz-. A more rational approach would be to consider the word-final element -óc to represent a Hungarian suffix which lends an abstract quality to the preceding word, as in gombóc a kind of dumpling that looks like a gomb 'button' or gömb 'ball' and vadóc a person who behaves like a vad 'savage'. The word pal then would be regarded the root, but its corresponding phonetic variants, like par, bar and bal should also be taken into account because they are also part of surnames. Cf. Paróczai, Baróczy, Balczó. Consequently, it is not entirely certain that Palóc is the original, or the only form, but may be a phonetically modified shape which either superseded or followed the others. It is common for the sound b to change to its voiceless counterpart p in all languages including Hungarian. Thus, an original bal could have easily changed to pal at an earlier time. None of the aforementioned variants would yield a recognizable meaning except bal which means 'left' in the current Hungarian vernacular. Bal was also associated with baj 'trouble' in antiquity as in balsors 'misfortune', baleset 'mishap', and so on. The word baj has been also used for name formation, cf. Bajnóczi.
The foregoing discussion points in the direction of Balóc as a possible primary form, a name that would be given to a group of troublemakers. A people difficult to manage. If so, the name's ultimate origin may be the Sumerian verb bal 'to be hostile, to upset, to rebel' (Gostony 1975: 42). PANNA Panna [pana]. Derived from the Latin pannus 'rag' or pannonus 'raged, shabby', the name denotes a poorly dressed individual. The word-final element -a is the archaic adjectival suffix. PAP Pap [pap]. Also spelled Papp. The Hungarian pap 'father' (used only in a religious sense for a priest) corresponds to the Sumerian pab 'father' and the Neo-Babylonian pap 'father' (Deimel 1939: No. 169). Old Hungarian spelling: 1239 Pap-. PARADY Parády [para:di]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a resident of Parád, a town in Heves County known for its spa. The name is comprised of the Sumerian gišpa 'branch' (Labat 1948: No. 295) and the Mid-Babylonian rad 'canal' (Labat 1948: No. 83). The toponym denotes a place by the distributary of a canal. PARAZS Parázs [parazh]. The Hungarian parázs means 'glowing embers' in present-day vernacular. The Hungarian Historical-Etymological Dictionary lists the Slavonic pražit, pražiti 'to quick fry, to roast' as [an unlikely] source. A Hungarian-Latin Dictionary published in 1604 by Albertus Molnar Szenci in Nürnberg spells the word parás, the



85
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
equivalent of the Latin pruna. If the word-final element -ás qualifies for the Hungarian adjectival suffix -ás then par is the root and parás is an adjective. According to the Új Magyar Tájszótár (New Hungarian Dialect Dictionary) the word parázs is associated with the condition porhanyós 'powdery, crumbling' derived from por 'dust'. This would suggest that parázs is a variant of poros 'dusty'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1585 Paras-; 1861 porázs. PARKANYI Párkányi [pa:rka:nji]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a former resident of Párkány, a town in Esztergom County of historical Hungary. Confined to Slovakia in 1920 and its name was changed to Štúrovo. The toponym Párkány may be derived from the Sumerian bar or the Akkadian parakku both meaning 'fort' (Labat 1948: No. 334). Old Hungarian spelling: 1295 parcan; 1425 parkan. PATAKI Pataki [pataki]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a dweller by the patak 'stream, brook'. The name may be derived from the Sumerian pa6 'ditch, drain' (Labat 1948: No. 60), or the Akkadian pattu which is close to present-day Hungarian phonetic value. The word-final element -ak is an active voice suffix. Old Hungarian spelling: 1200 potac-; 1210 potok; 1317 patak. PATASI Patasi [patashi]. A probable modified form of the Sumerian pa-te-si 'princecurate' (Labat 1948: No. 60). The cuneiform sign is also pronounced ensi. The name denoted a leader who performed both civic and clerical duties in Sumerian society. The Persian padeshah 'sovereign' (Lambton 1988: 30) may have also originated in the Sumerian language. PATAY Patay [patai]. The archaic derivational suffix -y marks a descendant of Pata 'hoof'. If the word-final element -a is the archaic adjectival suffix then the Hungarian root pat, English foot, Greek podos 'hoof' and Hittite pata 'foot' are cognates. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Pata. PECS Pécs [pe:ch]. Also spelled Péch. The name of a city in Baranya County. A resident of that city may have been called Pécs. The city may have received its name for the profusion of muskrats in the area. Muskrats belong to the same family as rats and the Sumerian word for ‘rat’ is peš (Labat 1948: No. 596). The initial element in the Hungarian pézsma-patkány 'muskrat' is pézs [pe:zh]. Trappers of muskrats may have also been called by such a name. The suggestion that the Hungarian Pécs is derived from the South-Slav peč 'oven, furnace’ (Kiss 1978: 505) does not take into consideration that the Slavonic peč is the initial element in words which mean 'roast, fried meat'. Their word for oven is furuna. Old Hungarian spelling: 1290 Peech. PENGO Pengő [pengø:]. The name is derived from peng 'ring, jingle' to which the participle -ő is suffixed to form an adjective. The name may originate from wearing a kind of ornament or jewelry that jingled. Old Hungarian spelling: 1501 Pengew; 1735 Pengő. PENTEK Péntek [pe:ntek]. Derived from the Greek pente 'five' the name may have been bestowed on the fifth child or one that was born on a péntek 'Friday'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Pentuk; 1165 Pentiki; 1332 Pintuk; 1372 pentek-. PESTI Pesti [peshti]. The derivational suffix -i marks a resident of Pest on the east side of the Danube, opposite Buda. An independent city until the unification with Buda in

1873, situated on the wide flat that extends from the shore of the river. The origin of the name may be traced to the Sumerian peš 'wide' (Deimel 1939: No. 204). The word-final element -t is a causative suffix. Old Hungarian spelling: 1148 pest. PETER Péter [pe:ter]. A derivation from the Greek petra 'rock' PILLER Pillér [pile:r]. The name is derived from an international loan-word of which the English equivalent is pillar. The origin of the word may be the Latin pila. PINTER Pintér [pinte:r]. 'Cooper, hooper', derived from the German Binde 'bond, tie'. Old Hungarian spelling: 1406 pyter; 1419 Pynter; 1423 Pinther; 1588 pinter. PIRI Piri [piri]. Also spelled Piry. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) denotes a descendent of Pír 'flush of dawn, aurora' (Országh 1977: 1604, vol. 2). An early riser may have been named so. The Hungarian Historical-Etymological Dictionary associates pír and pírkad with the color piros 'red', whereas pir is the stem and -os is the adjectival suffix. But Hungarians call the first appearance of light in the morning pír whether it is accompanied by a tint of red or not. The Hungarian pír may be derived from the Sumerian pirig 'light' (Labat 1948: No. 130). PIROS Piros [pirosh]. The Hungarian piros 'red', the Greek pirros 'fire-like red' may originate from a common root. Old Hungarian spelling: 1330 Pyrus; 1419 Piros. POGACSAS Pogácsás [poga:cha:sh]. Also spelled Pogátsás. 'Biscuit maker or seller'. The name is derived from the Turkish pogaça 'flaky pastry'. Similar phonetic forms and meanings are in the Slavonic languages, cf. Slovak pogač and Croatian pogača. Old Hungarian spelling: 1423 Pogachas. POGANY Pogány [poga:nj]. 'Pagan'. A derivation from the Latin discriminating epithet paganus 'a Non-Christian' which originally meant 'country folks' but was applied to those who did not convert to Christianity. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Pagan; 1329 Pogan; 1635 pogány-. POSA Pósa [po:sha]. The name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. It may be derived from the Middle-Babylonian púš 'restless' (Labat 1948: No. 60) to which the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a is attached. POZSONYI Pozsonyi [pozhonji]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Pozsony, the medieval coronation city and one time capital of historical Hungary. Confined to Slovakia in 1920 and renamed Bratislava. The city received its name from Pos [posh] name of the captain of its fortress (Kiss 1978: 523) which may be related to the Middle-Babylonian púš 'restless' (Labat 1948: No. 60). RAB Rab [rab]. Also spelled Rabb. The reduplicated b marks a stressed consonant. The name means ‘captive, prisoner’ in the Hungarian language. The word rab is present in the Slavonic languages but has different meaning: ‘servant’. Cf. Russian rob, Bulgarian rab. ‘Servant’ means szolga in the Hungarian language. The Hungarian rab is not a servant but a captured criminal or prisoner of war. Captives were kept in shackles in the old days when allowed outside a confined area. Thus, the Hungarian rab may have originated in the Sumerian language in which gišrab means ‘shackles’ (Labat 1948: No. 149).



87
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1498 Rab-; 1522 Rab. RABAI Rábai [ra:bai]. Also spelled Rábay. The derivational suffix -i indicates a dweller by the river Rába in western Hungary. The river’s name is most likely derived from the Estonian raba ‘swamp’ or Finnish rapa ‘mud, slush’ (Papp 1978: 643) and describes the muddy condition of the main course of water surrounded by marshes. Old Hungarian spelling: 1234 Rabay. RACZ Rácz [ra:ts]. The Hungarian Rác, also spelled Rátz, is an old name for a Serb. A prolonged mass migration of Serbs into southern Hungary began in 1439 when they crossed the Danube and Rábca rivers in front of the advancing Ottoman armies. The Bácska region (confined to Serbia in 1920, now called Vojvodina) was their chief area of settlement where they received lands, homes, language rights and exemption from most feudal obligations (Singleton 1985: 35, 44, 45, 49, 50, 73). Rácz is derived from the name of a 12th century Serbian principality recorded in Latin texts as Rasa, Rascia, Raxia (Benkő 1967: 326, vol. 3) and called Rashka in English language literature. It is a place near Novi Pazar, between Serbia and Montenegro and was the nucleus upon which greater Serbia was built. Old Hungarian Spelling: 1403 Rach; 1437 Raach; 1455 Racz. RADA. Rada [rada]. This name is a classic example for phonetic change and the use of an ancient adjectival suffix. It is comprised of rad that morphed into ragy in recent times. The plosive d changed to palatalized gy, a common occurrence in the Magyar vernacular. The word-final element -a is the archaic adjectival suffix, also present in the Sumerian language. It was replaced by the present-day ás. Consequently, written as ragyás, the name means ‘pock-marked’. RADI Rádi [ra:di]. Also spelled Rády. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates origin. A resident of a locality in Pest County called Rád. Originally the name of an old Hungarian clan, Rád is now part of numerous other toponyms in the Carpathian Basin. The word rad means ‘canal’ in the Middle-Babylonian language, equivalent of the Sumerian šita (Labat 1948: No. 83) whose phonetic value is similar to the Hungarian csatorna ‘canal’.
The Rád clan may have had a leading role in building canals for irrigation, ditches for draining swamps and other purposes. Remnants of an ancient canal and dike system extending in the easterly direction from Budapest to Ungvár and then south to Versec in the lower Danube area of historical Hungary is still detectable. The toponym Rád was recorded in Pest County in 1395 as Raad. The name has no meaning in present-day Hungarian. Other surnames derived from it are Ráday, Radics, Radó, Radócz, Rádonyi, Radva, Radvány. RAKOCZI Rákóczi [ra:ko:tsi]. Also spelled Rákóczy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic y) indicates a person from the town of Rákóc in Zemplén County of historical Hungary. The town was confined to Slovakia and renamed Rakovec nad Ondavou. The name of the town is derived from rák ‘crayfish’ to which the attribute -óc is affixed. Identical words exist in the Slavonic languages with identical meaning, cf. Polish rak ‘crayfish’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1390 Rakocz. RAPAI Rapai [rapai]. Also spelled Rappai. The reduplication of p marks a stressed consonant. The name is derived from the Finnish rapa ‘mud, slush’ (Papp 1978: 643) to

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
which the derivational suffix -i is affixed to indicate a dweller by an area saturated with water. RAVASZ Ravasz [ravas]. ‘Sharp, crafty’. A probable derivation from the Persian rava ‘lawful’ (Lambton 1988: 79). The original Hungarian word may have denoted a person familiar with the laws of the land. Old Hungarian spelling: 1135 Ruoz; 1342 Rawaz; 1620 Ravasz. REGOS Regős [regø:sh]. ‘Minstrel, bard’. Derived from rege the name of tale-like verses composed in honor of the achievements of leading personalities or heroes and recited at festivities. The word-final element -s denotes occupation or status. Old Hungarian spelling: 1219 Regus; 1401 Reges. REJTO Rejtő [rejtø:]. The name is derived from rejt ‘hide, conceal’ to which the participle -ő is affixed to denote a secretive, needlessly reserved person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1380 Rychtew; 1885 Rűtő. REMENYI Reményi [reme:nji]. Derived from remény ‘hope, expectation’ appended by the derivational suffix -i, the name signifies the descendent of a person full of hope and ambition. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Remen. RENDEK Rendek [rendek]. The name is a composite of rend ‘order, law’ and the substantive suffix -ek. It denotes an orderly, law obeying person. The legislative body in the Kingdom of Hungary was called the Assembly of Rendek. The word rend may be derived from the Sumerian rin ‘balance’ (Labat 1948: No. 393) and du ‘to create’ (Labat 1948: No. 230). Old Hungarian spelling: 1248 Rend-; 1296 Reend. RESO Réső [re:shø:]. An unusual name, it may be a variant of the Akkadian rêšu ‘head, leader’ (Labat 1948: No. 115). Another possibility is that it denotes an ancient miner. The Hungarian rés means ‘opening, hole’ but the participle -ő turns it into an action noun, i.e. an occupational name. It would have originated in the distant past when mining was done on the surface of an outcrop by carving holes into layers of minerals. Similar words can be found in the Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *raćɜ (Benkő 1967: 390, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Resu. RETI Réti [re:ti]. Also spelled Réthi and Réthy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a dweller on, or by the rét ‘pasture-land’. The h marks the reduced plosion of the preceding t. The word rét may be a relic from the distant past. A comparable Akkadian term rîtu ‘pasture-land’ (Labat 1948: No. 318) was recorded in Mesopotamia during the NeoBabylonian period. Old Hungarian spelling: 1210 Rethi; 1291 Rythy. REZSO Rezső [rezhø:]. A variant of Réső. See Reso for etymology. RIKA Rika [rika]. The Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a is attached to the Sumerian rig7 ‘to rule, to govern’ (Labat 1948: No. 295c). Compare with Réka, the wife of Attila the Hun was named so. ROKA Róka [ro:ka]. ‘Fox’. Owes its origin for slyness or other similar attributes. A probable derivative of the Sumerian lul-ka5-a ‘lying fox’ (Gostony 1975: 91).



89
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1558 Roka. RONAI Rónai [ro:nai]. Also spelled Rónay. The name denotes a dweller on the róna ‘plain, grass-land’ as indicated by the derivational suffix -i. The word róna is derived from the Slovak rovná ‘flat land’ according to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language. However this suggested origin is doubtful because the original dwelling places of Slovakians were mountainous areas. The cuneiform sign for the Old-Akkadian ru6 is the same as the sign for the Sumerian edin ‘plain’ (Labat 1948: No. 168), equivalent of the Hungarian egyen ‘plain’ from which egyenes ‘straight’ is derived. The Old-Akkadian ru6 maybe a Sumerian loan-word to which the adjectival suffix -a is appended by inserting the connecting consonant n, thus the resulting term runa is an action noun. Both u and ó are round back sounds therefore interchangeable, cf. Hungarian Mohi > Muhi (name of a field). Old Hungarian spelling: 1339: Rona. ROVID Rövid [røvid]. The name denotes a ‘short’ person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1275 reuid-; 1342 Ryuid-; 1522 Rewyd; 1611 röuid. RUDA Ruda [ruda]. The archaic adjectival suffix -a is appended to rúd ‘bar, mast, pole’ to signify a maker of such implements. Present-day form would be Rudas. Old Hungarian spelling: 1214 Roda; 1327 Rudas. SAAD Saád [sha:d]. The name may be derived from the Turkish şad ‘happy, joyful’. An alternative etymology would link the name with şad the title of a high dignitary among Mongolian Turks bestowed on members of the ruling family. It may be translated as ‘prince’. The title is engraved on the Orkhon Monument erected around A.D. 720 in Mongolia (Györffy 1975: 63, 276). SAFRANYOS Sáfrányos [sha:fra:njosh]. The adjectival suffix -os affixed to sáfrány ‘saffron’ indicates a grower of the plant or seller of the herb. The name of the plant is derived from the Persian za’fran (Lambton 1988: 348). Old Hungarian spelling: 1496 Safranyos; 1731 Sáfrányos-. SAGI Sági [sha:gi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant of Ság. The word šag ‘heart, center’ is of Sumerian origin (Gostony 1975: 29). SAJGO Sajgó [shajgo:]. The participle -ó is affixed to sajog, an obsolete dialectical word, meaning ‘shine, glitter’ (Bárczi és Országh 1959-1962: 1116, vol. 5). Old Hungarian spelling: 1560 Salgo; 1602 Saigo; 1630 saygo. SAJTOS Sajtos [shajtosh]. ‘Cheese maker or seller’. The name is comprised of sajt ‘cheese’ and the adjectival suffix -os that marks an occupation. The word sajt denotes the pressing process in cheese making. Other words derived from the same source are sajtó ‘printing-press’, sajtol ‘squeeze’ and satú ‘benchclamp’ which is identical with the Akkadian šahtu ‘press, squeezer’ (Gostony 1975: 81). Old Hungarian spelling: 1368: Saytas; 1372 saÿt-; 1533 Said-’; 1558 Saytos; 1563 sajt. SALA Sala [shala]. Variant of Csala ‘tempting, seductive’ (Kálmán 1978: 43). Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Sala. SALGA Salga [shalga]. Archaic form of salgó, sajgó ‘shine, sparkle’. A bright, cheerful individual may have been named so. See Sajgo.

Old Hungarian spelling: 1518 salyog; 1602 Saigo. SALLOS Sallós [shalo:sh]. A variant of Sarlós ‘maker or seller of sickles’. See Sarlós for etymology. SAMAN Sámán [sha:ma:n]. The title of a priest of Shamanism, an idolatrous religion once widely practiced in parts of Asia. Was unknown in Hungary before the end of the 18th century. The word may have originated in the Manchu-Tungus language, sa [sha] ‘know’ samán ‘one who has knowledge’ (Benkő 1967: 481, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1799 Sámány-; 1817 Sámán-. SAMU Samu [shamu]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It may be derived from the Sumerian šám ‘archer’ or the Akkadian šâmu ‘archer’ (Labat 1948: No. 187). SANTA Sánta [sha:nta]. Also spelled Sántha. ‘Lame, limping’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1367 Santha; 1410 Santa. SANYARU Sanyarú [shanjaru:]. ‘Wretched, poverty-stricken’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1513 sanaru; 1777 sonyoru; 1863 Sonyarú, sanyarú. SARGA Sárga [sha:rga]. The Hungarian sárga ‘yellow’ and the Akkadian arqu ‘yellow’ may derive from the same source. There are similar words in the Turkic languages, cf. Turkish sari [shari]. The name may have been bestowed on a person of pale complexion. Old Hungarian spelling: 1360 Sarga; 1642 sárga. SARI Sári [sha:ri]. Widely believed to be the endearing form of Sára which may be the derivative of the Sumerian šara ‘king’ (Labat 1948: No. 344). Old Hungarian spelling: 1610 sári. SARKANY Sárkány [sha:rka:nj]. The translation of sárkány is ‘dragon’ but widely used as a metonym for an antagonistic, bellicose person. The root-word may be derived from the Sumerian šur ‘furious, raging’ (Labat 1948: No. 329) followed by the connecting consonant k and the nominal suffix -ány. Similar words are in the Turkic languages, cf. Cumanian saxagan, Osmanli sazagan (Benkő 1967: 494, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 Sarcajn; 1222 Sarkan; 1630 Sárkány. SARLOS Sarlós [sharlo:sh]. The name is comprised of sarló ‘sickle’ and the adjectival suffix -ós indicating a maker, seller or frequent user of a sickle. Sarló appears to be the participle of sar evidenced by the suffix -ó. But the early forms of sarló, which include Solló, sollu and saló in addition to sarú and sóró, lend support to the possibility of sa [sha] to be the root of the word. The l or r are connecting consonants. Therefore, the Sumerian ša5 ‘to cut’ (Labat 1948: No. 97) is suggested for a possible source. Sarló is present in the following Uralic and Altaic languages: Udmurt (Votyak) śurlo, Komi (Zyrian) t’śarla, Cheremis sa’rla (Benkő 1967: 494, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1109 Sorlous. SARVARI Sárvári [sha:rva:ri]. Also spelled Sárváry. The derivational suffix -i (archaic y) indicates a resident of Sárvár, a city in Vas County. The name of the city is comprised of sár ‘mud’ and vár ‘fort’ suggesting that the original fortification was an earthwork. Old Hungarian spelling: 1288 Saarwar. SAS Sas [shash]. ‘Eagle’. A Hungarian metonym for a person having good eyesight.

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1213 Sos; 1256 Sas-. SEBA Seba [sheba]. Appears to be the archaic form of present-day Sebes ‘fast, swift’. The word-final element -a is the continuation of the Sumerian adjectival suffix. SEBES Sebes [shebesh]. ‘Fast, swift’. Also spelled Sebess. The root seb is associated with fastness and hot-headedness when appended by the adjectival suffix -es. An alternate etymology would be sebes ‘covered with sores’ or ‘having scars’. The initial element seb means ‘sore, scar’ appended by the adjectival suffix -es that indicates condition. Old Hungarian spelling: 1039 Schebis; 1137 Sebus; 1181 Sebes. SELLO Sellő [shelø:]. A dweller by the sellő ‘rapids’. The root sel is a variant of ser in sergő ‘merry go around’, or sür in sürgő ‘stirring’. The latter denotes the fast turbulent water typical of rapids. Old Hungarian spelling: 1792 sellö-. SEMJEN Semjén [shemje:n]. Derived from semlyék ‘bog, marsh’, the name suggests a dweller by a bog. Old Hungarian spelling: 1244 semek-; 1886 sömjék. SENYE Senye [shenje]. ‘Languishing’. Shortened variant of senyved ‘suffering, sickly’ Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Sene; 1164 Seneu; 1602 Senye. SEPER Seper [sheper]. ‘One who sweeps with a broom’. Also spelled söpör. A possible derivation from the Sumerian šar ‘to sweep’. Similar words are in the Turkic languages, cf. Turkish süpürmek ‘to sweep’, süpürge ‘broom’ (Akdikmen 1986: 59, 527), old Turkish sipir- ‘broom, brush’ (Clauson 1972: 792). Old Hungarian spelling: 1372 seper-; 1519 söpör-. SERA Séra [she:ra]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. It may be comprised of the Sumerian šèr ‘to link, to connect’ (Labat 1948: No. 152) and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a. It would then denote what is called in present-day Hungarian a szerelő ‘assembler’. SERENYI Serényi [shere:nji]. Descendant of a hard-working individual. The name incorporates the root ser which forms the root of other interrelated words that describe ‘speed, activity, diligence, hard-working’, the nominal suffix -ny and the derivational suffix -i. Old Hungarian spelling: 1194: suren; 1585 Sérény. SERES Seres [sheresh]. Also spelled Sörös. An occupational name, a maker or seller of ser/sör ‘beer’ was named so. The word-final element -es/-ös is the adjectival suffix that marks an occupation. Similar words exist in the Uralic and Altaic languages derived from the old Hindi surâ ‘beer, alcoholic beverage’ (Benkő 1967: 580, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1392 Seres; 1436 Swr; 1522 Seorws; Sér; 1560 seres. SIETO Siető [shietø:] ‘One who hurries’. A derivation from the Sumerian ši-ed ‘hurries’ (Gostony 1975: 54), appended by the participle -ő. Old Hungarian spelling: 1372 syetes-; 1450 siet-; 1637 sieteös; 1668 sijet-. SIK Sik [shi:k]. A probable derivation from the Turkish şik ‘neat, elegant’ (Akdikmen 1986: 346). SIKET Siket [shiket]. ‘Deaf’. Also spelled Süket. Old Hungarian spelling: 1332 Syket-; 1338 Siketh; 1402 Syketh; 1418 Swketh;

A probable variant of the Sumerian simug ‘blacksmith’ (Labat 1948: No. 338). SIP Síp [shi:p]. ‘Whistle’. A whistle-maker may have been called so. The Hungarian síp and the Sumerian šip ‘whistle’ (Labat 1948: No. 60) are identical in phonetic value and in meaning. SIPOS Sípos [shi:posh]. ‘Whistler, pipe-player’. The adjectival suffix -os indicates an occupation. See Sip for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1222 Sypus; 1416 Sypos; 1544 sipos-. SIR Sír [shi:r]. A person who had the tendency for crying over every little thing may have been called Sír ‘cry, weep’. The word sir may be a derivation from the Sumerian ir6, also marked as siš and šèš (Labat 1948: No. 581). The cuneiform signs are the combination of “water’ and ‘eye’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1300 syr-. SISA Sisa [shisha]. This name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. The three possible origins include the Sumerian šeš, Midle-Babylonian šiš ‘to polish, to rub’ (Labat 1948: No. 331) affixed by the adjectival suffix –a, that indicates an occupation: polisher. The present-day equivalent would be the surname Csiszár ‘polisher’, derived from csisz(-ol) ‘to polish. The Lebanese shisha may also be considered if the bearer of the name is a descendant of an immigrant from Lebanon. It is the name of a water pipe used for smoking flavored tobacco. A maker of such pipes may have received the name. Then there is the Persian šiša ‘bottle’ (Golden 2000: 162 #23) which may be considered. SISKA Siska [shishka]. A person having large flap-ears (Benkő 1967: 548, vol. 3) may have been called so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1419 Siska. SIVO Sívó [shi:vo:]. ‘Wretched’.

a dweller by a marsh. Old Hungarian spelling: 1244 Semek-; 1347 Semlek-; 1550 Semÿek; 1848 sömjék. SOMLO Somló [shomlo:]. A dweller near the Somló Mountain in Veszprém County may have been named so. The name embodies the root som, the connecting consonant l and the participle -ó. A mountain is prominently elevated near the town above the surrounding low hills, thus the name. Its name may have originated in Near Eastern languages. The Sumerian cuneiform for u5 ‘summit’ has changed to šam6 during the NeoAssyrian period (Labat 1948: No.78). Old Hungarian spelling: 1297 sumlo-. SOMOGY Somogy [shmodj]. Appears to be the altered form of the Sumerian simug ‘blacksmith’ (Labat 1948: No. 338). It is the name of a county in Hungary that may commemorate the name of its founder. The old Turkic čum ‘dogberry’ may also be considered, but is an unlikely source. Old Hungarian spelling: 1055 sumig, sumug; 1224 Symig. SOS Sós [sho:sh]. ‘Salt worker or seller’. Comprised of só ‘salt’ and the adjectival suffix -s. The Hungarian só and the Old Turkic şor ‘salt’ (Clauson 1972: 868) may be derived from the same source. Old Hungarian spelling: 1093 Sos-; 1254 Sous-; 1338 Sows; 1358 Sos-. SOROS Sörös [shørøsh]. A variant of Seres ‘maker/seller of beer’. See Seres. SUBA Suba [shuba]. The Hungarian suba is an ankle long, wide sheepskin-coat. The name may have been bestowed on a person for being associated with such a garment one way or another. The word was spelled szuba [suba] in 1585 (Benkő 1967: 609, vol. 3), that would point to the Akkadian subâtu ‘garment, cloak’ (Labat 1948: No. 536). But according to the Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language suba is an international loan-word present in many languages derived from the Arabic gubba. C.f. German schoube ‘long coat’, French jupe ‘skirt’ (Benkő 1967: 609, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1290 Suba; 1441 Swba; 1533 Suba. SUKE Süke [shyke]. ‘Deaf’. Archaic form of the present-day süket. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Suke, Syke, Sykue; 1838 Süke. SULE Süle [shyle]. The name may be derived from sül ‘bake, fry’ and denote an occupation. An alternative source would be the Sumerian šul ‘hero’ (Labat 1948: No. 467) to which the adjectival suffix -e is affixed. SUMEG Sümeg [shymeg]. Also spelled Sümegh. An occupational surname, probable variant of the Sumerian simug ‘blacksmith’ (Labat 1948: No. 338). It is also the name of a city in Veszprém County that may commemorate its blacksmith founder. Old Hungarian spelling: 1301 Symeg. SURANYI Surányi [shura:nji]. The derivational suffix -i is a frequent element in Hungarian surnames, it would indicate either a resident of Beregsurány, a locality in Szabolcs-Szatmár County, called Suran in 1279 (Kiss 1978: 104), or a dweller by a young forest. Surján means ‘young forest’ in the Hungarian language and sarj ‘young shoot’. The root sur is present in the Sumerian language in the form of šar and means ‘foliage’ (Labat 1948: No. 152).

SUTA Suta [shuta]. ‘Left-handed’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1468 Swta; 1655 suta. SUTI Süti [shyti]. The derivational suffix -i is affixed to süt ‘bake’ to indicate a descendant of a baker. Similar words exist in some of the Uralic languages (Benkő 1967: 634, vol. 3), but the ultimate origin may be the Sumerian šug ‘to bake, to cook’ (Gostony 1975: 84). SUVEGES Süveges [shyvegesh]. The maker or seller of cone shaped hats may have been called so. The initial element sü may be derived from the Sumerian si ‘horned’ (Labat 1948: No. 112), the second element vég means ‘end’ and the adjectival suffix -es indicates occupation in present-day Hungarian. The name describes the maker of headgears that have a pointed top like a horn. The cuneiform sign for the Sumerian si was pronounced šé [she:] during the old Babylonian period, later followed by ši [shi]. Old Hungarian spelling: 1082 Siweg; 1389 Syueges; 1488 Syweges; 1714 Süveges. SZABAD Szabad [sabad]. ‘Free’. A person free of feudal obligations may have been named so. The Hungarian szabad is shared with the Slavonic languages, cf. Slovakian slobodny, Serbo-Croatian slobodan, etc. Old Hungarian spelling: 1282 Zobod; 1368 zabad; 1597 szabad. SZABADKAI Szabadkai [sabadkai]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Szabadka a city in Bodrog County of historical Hungary. Confined to Serbia in 1920, its name was changed to Subotica. The city’s name means ‘free place’, comprised of szabad ‘free’ and the Sumerian ki ‘place’ (Labat 1948: No.461) modified to -ka according to vowel harmony. Old Hungarian spelling: 1391 Zabotka. SZABO Szabó [sabo:]. The participle -ó forms an adjective from the verb szab ‘to cut’ that denotes an occupation: szabó ‘tailor’ The word szab may be a derivative of the Sumerian šab ‘to cut’ (Labat 1948: No. 295k). The Middle-Babylonian sab corresponds to the Hungarian szab both in pronunciation and meaning. The Hungarian szabja ‘sabre’ is also derived from the same word, so is the name of a 9th century Magyar chieftain Szabolcs. Old Hungarian spelling: 1271 Zobov; 1292 Zobou; 1295 Zabow; 1383 Zabo; 1638 Szabo. SZAKACS Szakács [saka:ch]. ‘Cook’. The name may be comprised of the Sumerian šuku ‘food, fare’ (Deimel 1939: No. 285) and the Hungarian ács, an altered form of the adjectival suffix -ás [a:sh] that denotes an occupation. Similar words exist in the Slavonic languages like sokač ‘cook’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1240 Zakac; 1286 Zakach; 1638 Szakacz. SZAKAL Szakál [saka:l]. May be derived from the Sumerian sukal ‘high official, leader’ (Labat 1948: No.321). Not the same as Szakáll. SZAKALL Szakáll [saka:l]. ‘Beard’. The word szakáll is shared with the Altaic languages, cf. Turkish sakal ‘beard’, Uighur saqal, Mongol Saqa (Golden 2000: 205 #23). A relic from the distant past, a hybrid word that embodies the Sumerian su6 ‘beard’ (Labat 1948: No. 18) Neo-Assyrian súh ‘hair’ (Labat 1948: No.403) which are obviously cognate to the Hungarian szőr [sø:r] ‘hair’. The second element áll means



95
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
‘chin’. Hungarians differentiate between hair on top of the head called haj and the hair on other parts of the body; szőr. Szakáll falls into the latter category thus the need for descriptive definition. Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 Zacal; 1228 Zakal; 1602 Szakál; 1685 Szakáll. SZALAGOS Szalagos [salagosh]. ‘Ribbon-maker’. The adjectival suffix -os indicates an occupation. The sza [sa] segment of the Hungarian szalag has an identical phonetic value and meaning with the Sumerian sa (Deimel 1939: No. 83). The word appears to be comprised of the etymon sza, the connecting consonant l and the metathetic form of the Sumerian suffix -ga described by Lenormant (Lenormant 1877: 392). Cf. Ugric *śalɜ ‘strap, bracelet, to tie up’ (Benkő 1967: 658, vol. 3). SZALLASI Szállási [sa:la:shi]. The name denotes origin, one from the szállás ‘temporary living quarter’. It contains the following elements: száll ‘stay at’, the adjectival suffix -ás and the derivational suffix -i. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Zalas; 1229 Zallas; 1595 Szalas. SZAM Szám [sa:m]. An unusual surname, probably given to forerunners of accountants, or stock keepers, for the Hungarian szám means ‘number’. The word is a probable derivation from the Sumerian ám ‘a determination placed after the signs of ordinary numbers’ (Labat 1948: No. 579), but is also part of languages belonging to the Altaic family. Cf. Chuvash sum, Turkic, Turkmen, Nogai, Uighur san (Benkő 1967: 667, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1645 szám. SZANA Szana [sana]. The name embodies the root element szán ‘take pity, allot, give out’ and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a to indicate a compassionate person. Present-day spelling would be Szánó. The word szán is probably derived from the Sumerian sùn(-na) ‘to give, to donate’ (Labat 1948: No. 164). Identical phonetic forms in the Turkic languages mean ‘consider, wish, desire’. The Historical-Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language originates the Hungarian szán from them (Benkő 1967: 672, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1229 Sana. SZANTO Szántó [sa:nto:]. The participle -ó forms an adjective from szánt ‘plow’, the resultant name denotes an occupation: plough-man, tiller’. The word szánt may have been derived from the Sumerian sun ‘to split, to break, to tear up’ (Gostony 1975: 79). Old Hungarian spelling: 1109 Zamthov; 1211 Zamthou, Samthou; 1239 Zampto; 1354 Zantho; 1638 szanto. SZAPARY Szapáry [sapa:ri]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a descendant of Szapár, or one belonging to that family. The surname is probably a variant of Sabar or Sabir, the name of an ancient people of Asian origin. Their name is probably derived from the Sumerian su-bir but is also part of the vocabulary of the Altaic language group. When the Sumerian cuneiform sign for edin ‘plain, steppe’ is combined with the sign for su ‘family, multitude’ (Labat 1948: No. 7), then the pronunciation is not su-edin



96
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
but su-bir4 (Labat 1948: No.168) and may mean ‘people of the steppe’. But, if it is derived from the Turkic sapmak ‘to depart, to go astray’ as suggested by Gyula Németh (Németh 1990: 72-75), then it could assume the form sapar when applied to a group of people who separated from the main branch. SZARAZ Száraz [sa:raz]. A reserved uncommunicative person may have been named Száraz ‘dry’, a word shared with other Finno-Ugric languages. The reconstructed protoword is *śarɜ (Benkő 1967: 178, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1082 Zarros-; 1227 Zaroz-; 1256 Zaraz. SZEKALLO Székálló [se:ka:lo:]. ‘Butcher’s shop-man’ (Bárczi és Országh 1959-1962: 136, vol. 6). An antiquated name for the person serving customers in a butcher’s shop. It is comprised of szék ‘chopping block’ and álló ‘standing’ i.e. one who stands and works by the chopping block. SZEKELY Székely [se:kej]. Name of the indigenous Hungarian-speaking population of Transylvania (called Erdély in the Hungarian language). Erdély was an integral part of Hungary until 1920 when it was confined to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon. The origin of the name has been explained in many different ways but only Sumerian, Celtic, Latin and Turkish etymologies seem to provide satisfactory results. One such explanation is from József Thúry (cited by Németh 1990:103), who traced the name to the Chagatai Turk sikil ‘noble, racially pure, son of a king, prince’. This etymology is utilized by Németh to emphasize the meaning ‘tribe of the prince’ instead of ‘racially pure’. He argues that other interpretations would not fit into the Turkic onomastic system for tribal names. However, the ‘racially pure’ concept would be the one supported by the Sumerian sikil ‘pure, unadulterated’ (Labat 1948: 564). This is also supported by the Celtic Dacie ‘clear, pure’ survived as a girl’s name in Irish-Gaelic, a variant of the English Dacey and Latin Candace (McLaughlin 2011: 71). The Romans conquered the Transylvanian Daci in AD 107 but abandoned the land in AD 270. There is no evidence that the original Daci have disappeared or relocated to another area. The old Turkish eskil and izgil have also been considered and traced to a group of Turks who lived by the River Volga (Kiss 1978: 601). Eski means ‘old, ancient’ in current Turkish and eskiler ‘the ancients’ (Akdikmen 1986: 125). Old Hungarian spelling: 1092 Scichul; 1095 Scicul; 1308 Zecul; 1310 Zekul; 1353 Zekel; 1361 Scekel; 1408 Zekely (Szamota 1902-1906: 900); 1794 Székely (Benkő 1967: 710, vol. 3). SZEKER Szekér [seke:r]. ‘Wagon’. A maker of such vehicles may have been named so. The Hungarian szekér may be a distorted form of the Sumerian gigir ‘wagon’ (Labat 1948: No. 551, 486). The Middle- Iranian *sakar ‘wagon’ (Benkő 1967: 707, vol. 3) may also be considered. Old Hungarian spelling: 1451 Zerer-; 1597 szeker-; 1616 szekèr; 1669 szekér. SZEKFU Szekfű [sekfy:]. ‘Carnation’. A grower of carnations may have been named so. The name of the flower is a composite of szék a variant of szik ‘saline soil’ and fű ‘grass’. The carnation’s ability to grow in saline soil and its grass-like leafs are responsible for the name. Old Hungarian spelling: 1380 zekfw; 1493 Zekfy; 1522 zegffy; 1531 zegfw; 1544 szek fü-; 1560 Szegfü.

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
SZELE Szele [sele]. The word-final element -e is the variant of the participle -ó modified by of vowel harmony. The participle turns a vowel into an action noun that denotes occupation, thus Szele signifies ‘one who cuts’. The word szel ‘to cut, to slice’ is present in the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic family of languages. Cf. Vogul (Mańsi) sil- ‘cut, slice’, Finn säliä ‘split’ (Benkő 1967: 704, vol. 3). However the ultimate origin may be the Sumerian sil ‘to cut up’ (Deimel 1939: No. 11) ‘to split’ (Labat 1948: No. 12). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Sele, Selle, Seleh, Zele, Zeleh. SZEMERE Szemere [semere]. The Hungarian Anonymus chronicler (c. 1200) mentions the clan zemera [sic] in section 6 and 33. It may be the archaic form of the present-day Turkish semer ‘stout’ (Akdikmen 1986: 326). The word-final element -e is the archaic Hungarian and ancient Sumerian adjectival suffix -a modified by vowel harmony. The estate of the Szemere clan was situated in the area encompassing the towns of Hoba and Szemere during the reign of the Árpád dynasty (896-1301) (Györffy 1975: 289). The town of Szemere is in Borsod-Abaúj- Zemplén County. Old Hungarian spelling: 1243 Scemere. SZEMES Szemes [semesh]. The adjectival suffix -es is affixed to szem ‘eye’ to indicate a ‘clever, sharp, shrewd’ person (Bárczi és Országh 1959-1962: 177, vol.6). An alternative etymology would link Szemes with the Sumerian sim ‘to sift, to riddle’ (Labat 1948: No. 79) and še ‘grain’ (Labat 1948: No. 367). The Sumerian sim denotes the action of winnowing grain or sorting seed by hand. A person doing it would be called Szemes. Old Hungarian spelling: 1135 Scemus; 1211 Scimis, Semes, Zemus; 1400 Zemes; 1698 szemes-. SZENDE Szende [sende]. ‘Gentle, tolerant’. The word szende was coined during the 19th century language standardization when new words were derived from existing ones (Benkő 1967: 721 vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1823 Szende. SZENTE Szente [sente]. The name contains the root szent ‘saint’ and the derivational suffix -i changed to -e by vowel harmony. The name denotes a descendant of Szent. The Hungarian szent is derived from the Latin sanctus ‘sacred’ like the English saint.
Old Hungarian spelling: 1156 scent; 1176 Zent; 1195 szent. SZEP Szép [se:p]. ‘Beautiful, comely’. CF. Persian ziba ‘beautiful, comely’ (Lambton 1988: 83). Old Hungarian spelling: 1116 Scip-; 1138 Zep-; 1416 zep; 1439 Zeep-; 1602 Szép. SZEPESI Szepesi [sepeshi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from the Szepes region of historical Hungary. Confined to Slovakia in 1920 and renamed Špišská. The name of the region is derived from the Hungarian szép ‘beautiful’ to which the adjectival suffix -es is affixed. See Szep for etymology. Old Hungarian spelling: 1279 Zepus. SZERB Szerb [serb]. ‘Serbian’. The name Serb is cognate with Sorb. The ethnic denominator Sorb is habitually used as a synonym for Wends, a people of Slavic origin living in northern Germany. The name Szerb entered the Hungarian lexicon after the battle of Kosovo in 1389

when Serbian refugees settled in the southern regions of historical Hungary. That area (Bácska and part of Bánát) was confined to Szerbia in 1920. Old Hungarian spelling: 1405 Szirb; 1516 Zerb-; 1783 Szerbi. SZERI Szeri [seri]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Szer, a frequent element of place names in the Carpathian Basin. Those place names were given in recognition that once a szer ‘diet’ was convoked there. Presence of the word szer is verifiable in both the Uralic and Sumerian languages having identical phonetic values and meanings that express the actions of a governing body. In the Hungarian language szer [ser] means ‘public body, proceedings, assembly’ while in Obdorski Ostyak sír [si:r] and śír [shi:r]. mean ‘custom, rule, law, statute’ (Benkő 1967: 730, vol. 3). The Sumerian pictograph transliterated as sar5 by René Labat (Labat 1948: No. 86), modified to šar5 by Florence Malbran-Labat (1988) and dated to the Ur period, is a vertical line intersected by two parallel horizontal lines. Its meaning is: rule ruler, order. The pictograph looks very much the same as the Hungarian insignia for the head of state and still being used as part of the coat of arms of the country. Another Sumerian pictograph that has the same look is pronounced šár ‘prince’, but the reduplicated form šár-šár is translated as ‘to discuss, to debate’ which is tantamount to the Hungarian ‘proceedings’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1015 Zeru; 1138 scer; 1150 Scerii; 1340 -zyr; 1385 zeer; 1872 szer-. SZERZE Szerze [serze]. A variant of szerző ‘writer, author’. The word is a composite of the Sumerian sar ‘to write’ (Deimel 1939: No. 118) the connecting consonant z and the participle -ő that was modified to -e by vowel harmony. Old Hungarian spelling: 1604 Szerző. SZIGET Sziget [siget]. A dweller on an island may have been referred to as Sziget ‘island’. It is a probable derivation from the Sumerian zìg ‘to rise, to stand up’ (Thomsen 1984: 322), or zi(g)-(ga) ‘heaving’ (Labat 1948: No. 84) to which the formative -et was affixed to form a derived noun from a verb. Considering that an island rises or stands above the water the Sumerian origin seems plausible. Old Hungarian spelling: 1055 ziget; 1109 Sciget; 1240 Zyget; 1293 zygueth; 1320 szygeth; 1322 sciget; 1521 szygeth. SZIJJARTO Szíjjártó [si:ja:rto:]. Archaic form of Szijgyártó ‘harness-maker’. Anglicized form is Seyarto. The name is comprised of szij ‘strap’, járt/gyárt ‘make, manufacture’ and the participle -ó. The participle -ó forms adjectives and names of occupations from verbs. See next entry for the etymology of szíj. The Hungarian gyár ‘factory’ and gyárt ‘make, manufacture’ are identical with the Sumerian gar ‘make, manufacture’ (Deimel 1939: No. 336). Cf. Turkish yaratmak ‘to create’, yaratan ‘maker, creator’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1322 Ziugartho-; 1375 Zyugyartou; 1697 Szijárto-. SZIJJ Szíjj [si:j]. The reduplicated j marks a stressed consonant. The Hungarian szíj ‘strap’ is derived from szil [sil], szel ‘to cut, to slice’. The word is shared with other Uralic languages, the reconstructed proto-word is *sale (Benkő 1967: 704, vol. 3). However, the Sumerian sil [sil] ‘to split, to cut up’ (Labat 1948: No. 12) may be the ultimate source of the word.

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1270 ziu-; 1451 Zy-; 1567 szij-. SZILADI Sziládi [sila:di]. Also spelled Szilády. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicate a dweller in or by a szilád ‘A place abundant in elm trees’. The root szil ‘elm’ is followed by the archaic adjectival suffix -a and the suffix -d that denotes a place. The palatal equivalent of this suffix is -gy in Szilágyi. This surname may have originated in the marshy region of Szilágyság, an area in historical Hungary confined to Romania in 1920. It is now part of the Satù Mare administrative district. The original Hungarian name has been abolished. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Sila; 1246 Scylag; 1494 Zilagysag. SZILAS Szilas [silash]. Appears to be the archaic form of szíjgyártó ‘strap-maker’, derived from the Sumerian sil ‘to split, to cut up’. See Szijjarto and Szijj for more information. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Sila. SZIRAK Szirák [sira:k]. Derived from Szír [sir] the Turkic name of a people, recorded on the Orkhon monument c. A.D. 720 in Mongolia. Its exact meaning has not been established (Györffy 1975: 278). SZOGI Szögi [søgi]. Also spelled Szegi and Szeghy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Szög. The word szög ‘nail’ is shared with other languages of the Uralic language family. A possible source of szög is the Sumerian sìg ‘to hit, to stab, to squeeze’ (Labat 1948: No. 295) which describes the action necessary to drive a nail into wood or other material. The name Szög may have been given to a maker of nails, spikes or other piercing implements such as szigony ‘harpoon’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1067 Sceg-; 1358 Zege; 1575 szëg. SZOMJAS Szomjas [somjash]. ‘Thirsty’. The name may have been bestowed on a heavy drinker. The adjectival suffix -as denotes personal characteristics when affixed to szomj ‘thirst’. The word szomj may be a variant of the Akkadian sûmû ‘thirst’ (Labat 1948: No. 28). Old Hungarian spelling: 1389 Zomyw; 1668 Szomjú. SZONDY Szondy [sondi]. The Turkish son ‘end, termination’ is followed by the suffix -d that denotes a place and the archaic derivational suffix -y. The name indicates one from the frontier or a remote place. The Hungarian surname Véghely is equivalent of the Turkish Szondy. SZUHAI Szuhai [suhai]. Szuha is the name of a tributary of the creek Sajó in Hungary. A dweller by the Szuha may have been named so. The derivational suffix -i indicates geographic origin. Szuha cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language, but is compatible with the Sumerian sùh ‘muddy, murky’ (Labat 1948: No.569). The SumeroHungarian adjectival suffix -a indicates condition. An appropriate name for a murky stream. It should also be noted that a means ‘water’ in the Sumerian language. The Slavonic origin from sucha ‘dry’ (Kiss 1978: 621) [proper spelling: suchy] is not convincing. Another Hungarian river in the same region Zagyva ‘clouded, murky, unclear’ emulates the name Suha. Old Hungarian spelling: 1292 Szuha-; 1299 Suha.

Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
SZULE Szüle [syle]. The participle -e is suffixed to the root szül ‘give birth’ to indicate a ‘parent’. Szüle is an altered form of the prevalent szülő. The Sumerian sal-la ‘parent’ (Gostony 1975: 56) is the likely source of the word. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Sileu, Silev, Silleu; 1483 Zyle. SZURDOKI Szurdoki [surdoki]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a dweller by the szurdok ‘ravine, canyon’. The word-final element -ok is an inactive formative. Surdok may be derived from the Sumerian sùr ‘passage for water’ (Labat 1948: No. 405). Similar words are in other Ugric languages, the reconstructed proto-word is *śorɜ (Benkő 1967: 787, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 Zorduc; 1267 Zurduk-; 1601 Szurdok. SZUROMI Szuromi [suromi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from the szurom that has no meaning in the present-day Hungarian language but may be derived from the Sumerian šurim ‘farm, fold, pen’ (Deimel 1939: No. 101). The name would then denote one from the farm. SZUSZA Szusza [susa]. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language to a high degree of certainty. It is a possible derivation from szusz ‘breath, wind’ to which the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a is affixed to indicate a person who breathes fast and audibly. Another possibility is Susa, the name of an ancient city, capital of the kingdom of Elam, whose origins lie in prehistoric times. The remains of ancient Susa are in Iran at the village of Shush (Biblical Shuhsan), near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, 160 miles north of Abadan. The city was founded around 4000 B.C. The name is too old to ascertain the motivation behind it. A person from Susa may have been named so. TABI Tabi [tabi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Tab, a town in Somogy County. The town’s name may commemorate its founder. It is probably an older form of the Hungarian több ‘more, a number of, good many’ (Kiss 1978: 624). It may be a continuation of the Sumerian tab ‘to double, to multiply, twins’ (Labat 1948: No. 124). The appellation may denote one of the twins. Old Hungarian spelling: 1320 Tob; 1211 Thob. TAGANYI Tagányi [taga:nji]. The derivational suffix -i denotes a descendant of Tagány. The suffix -ány forms nouns from verbs when they are the instrument of action. The Hungarian tag(-ol) ‘dismember, break up’ is identical with the Sumerian tag ‘to break’ (Labat 1948: No. 126) both in phonetic value and in meaning. The Hungarian root tag means ‘limb, member, part’. The name may denote a butcher who dismembers the carcass, or any other occupation that involves the separation of a whole into parts. The Hungarian tagló ‘poleax, cleaver’ is also derived from the same root. TAKACS Takács [taka:ch]. An occupational name that means ‘weaver, fabric maker’. The name is comprised of tak, probably derived from the Sumerian túg (Neo-Babylonian túk) ‘fabric, cloth’ (Labat 1948: No. 536). The word-final element ács [a:ch] means ‘carpenter’ as an independent Hungarian word. However, it may be safe to suggest that when denoting occupations, it is the altered form of the adjectival suffix -ás [a:sh]. The change from [sh] to [ch] is affected by affrication. Hungarians share the word takács with the Slavonic languages, cf. Polish tkacz,



101
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Serbo-Croatian tkaš, Slovakian tkáš ‘weaver’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1330 Thakach; 1377 Takach-; 1648 takács. TAKARO Takaró [takaro:]. The literal translation of takaró is ‘cover’ but it is used metaphorically to denote an evasive person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Thocorou; 1369 Takaro. TAKSONY Taksony [takshonj]. Originally the name of a Turkish chieftain in medieval Hungary. The town of Taksony in Pest was named after him. The name is of Turkish origin, cf. toqšin, toqšun ‘wild, unrestrainable’ (Kiss 1978: 626). Old Hungarian spelling: 950 Taxin; 1270 Toxun. TALAS Tálas [ta:lash]. The adjectival suffix -as indicates a maker or seller of dishes when affixed to tál ‘dish, platter’. The word tál is part of the Ugric branch of the Uralic family of languages as well as the New Persian vocabulary; cf. Upper-Loswa dialect of Vogul (Mańsi) tulana ‘wooden bowl’, New Persian tal ‘bowl, platter’ (Benkő 1967: 826, vol. 3). However, all three may be derived from the Sumerian dal ‘potter’s wheel’, dugdal ‘vase’ (Labat 1948: No. 86). Old Hungarian spelling: 1402 Thalas; 1429 Tallas; 1459 Talas; 1634 Tálas. TALTOS Táltos [ta:ltosh]. The name denotes a member of the Pre-Christian Hungarian priestly caste. The initial element tál may be derived from the Sumerian tál ‘wisdom’ (Labat 1948: No. 383) followed by the connecting -t- and the adjectival suffix -os that indicates status and rank. It may be noteworthy that the original Sumerian pictograph is like the bishop’s hat. The title táltos was bestowed on sages, wizards, medicine man and spiritual leaders in old Hungarian society. Similar words are in the Ugric branch of the Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *tultɜ ‘magic’ (Benkő 1967: 832, vol. 3). TAMI Támi [ta:mi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a descendant of Tám ‘a supporter’. A parallel may be drawn with the Sumerian dim ‘pillar, bond, link’ (Labat 1948: No. 94). The Middle-Assyrian tam ‘pillar, bond, link’ is identical with the Hungarian phonetic value. The Hungarian gyám ‘guardian’ appears to be a variant of the Sumerian dim. TANDARI Tandari [tandari]. Also spelled Tandori. A probable derivation from tandoori a type of oven used throughout Asia. TAPAI Tápai [ta:pai]. Also spelled Tápay. The derivational suffix -i indicates one from Tápé, a town in Csongrád County, now part of Szeged. The name is of Turkic origin, cf. old Turkish, Uighur tapay ‘service’ (Kiss 1978: 628). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Tapaí. TAR Tar [tar]. Also spelled Tarr. The name may have been bestowed on a bald person. The Hungarian tar ‘barren, bald’ is identical with the Sumerian tar ‘to destroy, to cut’ (Labat 1948: No.12). This relationship is exemplified by the Hungarian verb tarol ‘to make barren, to destroy’ and tarló ‘stubble-field’. Similar words are in the Turkic languages in the form of taz, daz ‘bald’ (Benkő 1967: 847, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1229 Tor; 1315 Thor-; 1341 Taar; 1344 Thaar; 1371 Tar. TARKA Tarka [tarka]. ‘Motley’. A person regularly wearing mottled garb may have been named so. The name contains the root tar, the connecting consonant k and the adjectival suffix -a. The source of the word may be the Sumerian dar, dar-a ‘motley’ (Labat 1948: No. 114).

Similar words are in the Turkic languages: Kazakh tarlan ‘spotty (horse)’; Kirghiz tarlan ‘grey’; Karachai talyïr ‘motly’; Osmanli dirgil ‘multicolored’; Mongolian tar-lan ‘motley’ (Benkő 1967: 854, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1470 Tharka; 1602 Tarka. TAS Tas [tash]. A name of Turkish origin: taş ‘stone, rock’. One of the seven chieftains that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896 was named Tas. TASZAJTO Taszajtó [tasajto:]. Regional variety of taszító ‘pushing, shoving’. A hustler may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1523 Thazytho. TATAR Tatár [tata:r]. ‘Tartar’. The name is used in Hungary as a synonym for a Mongolian. Old Hungarian spelling: 1176 Tathar; 1211 Tatar. TAUSZ Tausz [taus]. A name of Persian origin: ta’us ‘peacock’ (Lambton 1988: 320). The name may have been assigned to a breeder of pea-fowls. TAVASZI Tavaszi [tavasi]. Also spelled Tavaszy. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) marks a descendant of Tavasz ‘spring’. A person born in the spring may have received the name. Listed as a Uralic word in Hungarian dictionaries having a reconstructed protoword *toβkɜ. However, there is a strong possibility that the Akkadian Tammuz, derived from the Sumerian dDumu-zi the ‘god of spring’ (Labat 1948: No. 144) is the source. Another sign, the cuneiform for dumu whose semantic field includes ‘newborn’ and the phonetic form zi means ‘life’ (Labat 1948: No. 84). Spring is the season for plants to bud and begin to grow and for animal life to bring forth of offsprings. Life starts anew in the spring and the Sumerians may have called this season appropriately dumu-zi ‘newborn life’ which became Tammuz in the Akkadian culture at a later date and the name of their God for this season. The name of a Hungarian leader was Tonuzoba (c. AD 1000). The name may be a distorted form of Tammuz-aba ‘father-spring’, cf. Hungarian Tavasz-apa. TEGLAS Téglás [te:gla:sh]. The root of the word tégla ‘brick’ is most likely derived from the Turkish tugla ‘brick’. The word-final element -s is an adjectival suffix that indicates occupation, thus ‘brick maker’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1334 Tyglas-; 1347 Teglas. TEKENOS Tekenős [tekenø:sh]. Antiquated form of present-day teknős ‘maker of troughs and wash tubs’. The name is derived from the Turkish tekne ‘trough, vat’. The suffix -s indicates occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1430 Thekenews; 1458 Thekenes; 1521 Tekewnos; 1669 tekenyős. TEL Tél [te:l]. The name may have been bestowed on a person born in the winter. The Hungarian tél ‘winter’ is classified by linguists as a word of Uralic origin. The reconstructed proto-word is *tälβä ‘winter. But there is a good reason to consider the Sumerian til ‘end, old’ as the source. The cuneiform sign for til was used for expressing the passing of time, cessation, death and completion (Labat 1948: No. 69). The Hungarian tél is phonetically almost identical to til and could easily be associated with the last season of the year when vegetation goes dormant and animals start to hibernate. ‘Old man winter’ is a popular



103
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
expression for this season in many languages. Old Hungarian spelling: 1269 tel-. TELEK Telek [telek]. The name denotes the owner of a telek ‘parcel of land’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 theluch; 1206 theluc-; 1211 -thelegu, Telug; 1224 Teluk; 1228 telek-. TELEPI Telepi [telepi]. The resident of a telep ‘settlement’ may have been named so. The word-final element -i is the derivational suffix. Old Hungarian spelling: 1456 telep. TEMES Temes [temesh]. Dweller by the river Temes may have been named so. The Hungarian temes appears to be a variant of tömés derived from töm ‘fill, stuff’. The adjectival suffix -es indicates condition. In case of the river Temes in the Bánság district of historical Hungary the name may refer to the sandy deposits that gradually build up in its bed. This area was confined to Romania in 1920 and the name changed to Timiş. Identical words are in other Uralic languages, cf. Eastern-Mari (Cheremis) temem ‘fill, stuff’ (Benkő 1967: 960, vol. 3) but they all show close affiliation with the Sumerian temen ‘earth-fill, earthwork’ (Labat 1948: No. 376). Old Hungarian spelling: 1150 Temes. TEMESVARI Temesvári [temeshva:ri]. Also spelled Temesváry. One from Temesvár, a city by the river Temes in historical Hungary, may have been named so. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates origin. The meaning of Temesvár is ‘fort made of earthwork’, synonymous with Földvár ‘earthwork’. See above for more information. The element vár may be of Sumerian origin, cf. bár ‘circular wall’ (Deimel 1939: No. 49). Old Hungarian spelling: 1315 Temeswar. TENGERDY Tengerdy [tengerdi]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from Tengerd ‘place by the sea’ as marked by the grammatical designator -d that denotes a place. The Hungarian tenger ‘sea’ was most likely whittled out of the Sumerian engur ‘sea, ocean’ (Labat 1948: No. 484). Old Hungarian spelling: 1152 Tengurdi; 1211 Tengurd; 1256 Tengerd. TERENYI Terényi [tere:nji]. Also spelled Trényi. The derivational suffix -i indicates a dweller by a terény derived from tér ‘park, field, ground’. The suffix -ény converts a noun into a collective noun. The Hungarian tér is identical with the Sumerian tir ‘park, field, ground’ (Labat 1948: No. 375). TEVELY Tevely [teveli]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicate a person from Tevel. A village named Tevel is in Veszprém County and another is in Tolna County. Both villages preserve the Turkish name of their founder Tevel, grandson of Árpád, the founder of the dynasty named after him (Németh 1990: 79). Old Hungarian spelling: 905-959 Teveli. THOKOLY Thököly [tøkøli]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from Tököl a community in Pest County. The name is derived from the old Turkish tükäl ‘faultless, complete’ (Kiss 1978: 656). Old Hungarian spelling: 1272 Thukul. THURY Thúry [tu:ri]. The archaic derivational suffix indicates a descendant of Thúr derived from túr. Though the verb túr ‘to dig, to poke’ exist in the Hungarian language, it would be an unlikely choice for a surname. The Sumerian tur ‘small, short’ (Labat 1948:



104
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
No. 144) is the most likely source. It may also be the root element of törpe ‘dwarf, pigmy’. TIBOR Tibor [tibor]. A possible derivation from the Sumerian tibir ‘hand, palm’ (Labat 1948: No. 126). The Hungarian tenyér ‘palm of the hand’ shows a close resemblance to the Sumerian tibir. A person having bigger than average hands may have received the name. The name’s endearing form Tibi is almost identical with tibir. The Roman source Tibur, the ancient name of Tivoli a commune near Rome, as listed in the Book of Hungarian Forenames (Ladó 1978: 21) is possible but unlikely. TIKASZ Tikász [tika:s]. Archaic form of tyúkász ‘poultry-farmer’. The formative suffix ász converts a noun into occupation. Tik, tyúk mean ‘chicken, hen’. Similar words exist in the Turkic languages cf. Turkish tavuk, Uighur takïyu (Benkő 1967: 1020, vol. 3). The ultimate source may be the Sumerian ti-ku ‘chicken, hen’ (Gostony 1975: 140). Old Hungarian spelling: 1109 Tikus; 1275 Tykus; 1452 Thywkws; 1482 Thykos. TIMAR Tímár [ti:ma:r]. ‘Tanner, skin dresser’. The word tímár is shared with the Turkish timar ‘to dress leather after it is tanned’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 timar, Timar. TINODI Tinódi [tino:di]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Tinód a town in Transylvania. Confined to Romania in 1920 and renamed Tinăud. The toponym consists of tinó ‘young male ox’ and the suffix -d that denotes a place. The Hungarian tinó has counterparts in the Chuvash tina, Chagatai tana and in other Turkic languages (Benkő 1967: 920, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1219 Tinod. TOKAR Tokár [toka:r]. Derived from the Slavonic tokar ‘turner’, one who worked with a lathe. TOKODI Tokodi [tokodi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Tokod, a town in Komárom County. The place name is derived from tok ‘case, box’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1181 Tokod. TOLGYESI Tölgyesi [tøldjeshi]. Also spelled Tölgyesy and Tölgyessy. The name is comprised of the initial element tölgy ‘oak’, the adjectival suffix -es and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). The name denotes a descendant of a dweller by the oak grove. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Tulgus-; 1373 Telgyes; 1460 Thewlges; 1602 Tölgyes. TOMA Toma [toma]. The name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. The element tom may be derived from the Sumerian túm ‘to supply, to provide’ (Labat 1948: No.206). The Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a indicates an occupation. Toma may have been a wholesaler in antiquity. TOMLOS Tömlős [tømlø:sh]. The adjectival suffix -s indicates a maker of tömlő ‘water or wine bag made out of animal skin’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1374 Temles-. TORDA Torda [torda]. The name of a city in Aranyos-Torda County of historical Hungary. This area was confined to Romania in 1920 and the name was changed to Turda. This spelling agrees with the old Hungarian spelling Turda in 1075 (Kiss 1978: 652). The initial element tor may be derived from the Sumerian tur5 ‘entrance’ (Labat 1948: No. 58) to which the grammatical designator -da is suffixed to indicate a place.



105
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
The city is near a major geological crevice and the city’s location may have been the most suitable place in antiquity to gain passage to the area beyond. TOREK Törek [tørek]. The word törek ‘chaff’ has no probable reason to form a surname. The suffix -ek forms nouns from verbs. The verb tör ‘to break, smash’ may be derived from the Sumerian tar ‘to break, to slice’ (Labat 1948: No.12). A stone-breaker, -crusher may have been named so. TORMA Torma [torma]. ‘Horse-radish’. A grower of horse-radish may have been named so. The word is also present in the Turkic languages, cf. Uighur turma. Old Hungarian spelling: 1437 Thorma; 1530 Torma. TOROK Török [tørøk]. The ethnic name Török ‘Turk’ may have originated in Uighur, one of the Turkic languages, in which türk means ‘powerful, strong’ (Németh 1990: 41). This name may have been conferred on the Turkish nation in recognition of their military might. The Ottoman Turks use the same name for themselves. Turkish presence can be observed in Hungary from the beginning of their written history. Most of the founding tribes of the Kingdom of Hungary belonged to the Turkic ruling class and mingled with the indigenous Magyars. Another Turkish infusion occurred during the 150 years of Turkish rule in most parts of historical Hungary beginning in 1526. Old Hungarian spelling: 1055 turku; 1211 Turk; 1239 Thevrek; 1364 Turek; 1390 Terek; 1411 Thwruk; 1444 Thewrewk; 1476 Twrwk; 1560 Thörök; 1610 török. TORPE Törpe [tørpe]. ‘Dwarf, pigmy’. The name cannot be etymologized in the Hungarian language. May be a derivation from the Sumerian tur ‘small, short’ (Labat 1948: No. 144). Törpe is comprised of the root tör, the connecting consonant p and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -e (variant of -a). Old Hungarian spelling: 1525 Terpe; 1594 Teörpe. TOT Tót [to:t]. Also spelled Tóth. The old Hungarian name for a Teuton (German), erroneously applied to Slovaks. The term originally referred to the Teutonic tribes who lived in parts of north-western Hungary in the Carpathian Mountains as late as the 6th century A.D (Györffy 1977: 27). The name is an indication that the pre-Slavic population of that area was of Teutonic descent. Introduced during the early periods of contact between the indigenous Magyars and Teutons, the name Tót is so firmly established by tradition that it is able to eclipse the more recent name Slovak. Old Hungarian spelling: 1121 Tout; 1219 Tot; 1240 Thout; 1297 Toth. TUNDERES Tündéres [tynde:resh]. ‘Like a fairy’. The name is derived from tündér ‘fairy’ to which the adjectival suffix -es is affixed to indicate likeness. The word tündér is a combination of the verb tűn ‘appear, materialize’, the connecting consonant d and the deverbative -er. The Hungarian tündér may be compared to the Sumerian dingir ‘determinative preceding names of divinities’ (Malbran-Labat 1988: No. 13). An alternative etymology would be tünd(-öklő) ‘shine, glow, glitter’. Tünde a popular Hungarian female forename is derived from the root tűnd. Old Hungarian spelling: 1416 tunder-; 1571 tündör-; 1652 tundir-. TURUL Turul [turul]. The name of a hawk the Hun and Hungarian nobility of Turkic origin used for hunting game birds and small animals for sport. The Hungarian turul is an altered form of the Turkish toğrul [to:rul] ‘goshawk’ (Akdikmen 1986: 375). It is the



106
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
largest species of the accipiters. Old Hungarian spelling: 1274 Turul. TUSKO Tuskó [tushko:]. A small but stocky person may have been named so. The Hungarian tuskó ‘stump, root timber’ may be derived from the Sumerian tuš ‘base’ (Labat 1948: No. 536). TUZA Tuza [tuza]. ‘Salt merchant’. Comprised of the Turkish tuz ‘salt’ (Akdikmen 1986: 380) and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a. UDENYI Üdényi [yde:nji]. Dialectic form of idényi ‘seasonal worker’. Derived from üdő/idő ‘time, duration’ to which the nominal suffix -ny is affixed to indicate a period of action. The word-final element -i marks a derived noun. The Hungarian idő appears to be cognate with similar words in the Turkic languages, cf. Uighur öd ‘time’ (Benkő 1967: 188, vol. 2). See additional information below. UDO Üdő [ydø:]. Dialectic form of idő ‘time, duration’. A punctual person may have received the name. The word-final element -ő is the participle -ó modified by vowel harmony. The root üd, id is identical with the Sumerian ud ‘time duration’ (Labat 1948: No. 380). Old Hungarian spelling: 1372 ÿdew, ewdew; 1456 ÿde; 1649 ydü; 1794 üdü, üde. UDVARHELYI Udvarhelyi [udvarheji]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from an udvarhely, a name exclusively used for the royal lodges in the country for temporary residences of the king or his representative and his entourage. The name is a compound of udvar ‘court, yard’ and hely ‘place’. The Hungarian udvar, spelled hudwor in 1075, is shared with similar words in the Slavonic languages, cf. Serbo-Croat dvor court and yard’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1204 Wduorhel; 1263 vduarhely; 1373 Oduorhel; 1462 Vdwarhel. UGI Ugi [ugi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Ug a place in medieval Hungary in Baranya County, now part of Szársomló. Spelled Wgh in 1287 (Györffy 1987: 398). UGRAI Ugrai [ugrai]. ‘A person from Ugra, name of the region where the Vogul (Man’si) and Ostyak (Chanti) people live as recorded by Arab sources in the 10th century and by European scholars in the 15th and 16th centuries (Benkő 1967: 1025, vol. 3). The area is in western Siberia on the north side of the Ob River near the confluence of the Irtis. Variants of Ugrai were recorded in 1138 as Vgrin, Vgrun, Vgron (Fehértói 1983: 355-356). UJJ Ujj [uj]. Derived from új ‘new’ the name may have been bestowed on a newly arrived person to town. The reduplication of j marks a stressed consonant. Old Hungarian spelling: 1193 Vi; 1222 Wi; 1230 Huy; 1240 Vy; 1250 -uy; 1731 új-. UKK Ükk [yk]. Variant of ük ‘great-great grandparent’, synonymous with ‘ancestor, forbear’. The reduplicated k marks a stressed consonant. Considered to be of Ugric origin, the reconstructed proto-word is *ikkɜ (Benkő 1967: 1050, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Ikeh; 1215 Yku; 1395 yk; 1838 Uk. UNGHY Unghy [ungi]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates a person from Ung,



107
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
the name of a County in historical Hungary. Confined to the Ukraine in 1945, the name was discontinued. The h marks the reduced plosion of the preceding g. Spelled Hung and Vng in 1150 (Kiss 1978: 670), the meaning of the name is obscure, but shows strong resemblance to the Sumerian unu(g) ‘dwelling, habitation’ (Deimel 1939: No.136). The Sumerian city of Uruk was also referred to as unug-ki (Biblical Erech). UR Úr [u:r]. The Hungarian úr means ‘refined gentleman, sir, lord, proprietor’ synonymous with wealth, power and authority. It is a much used honorific title, like Mister and Sir in the English language. A variant is present in the Finnish language: uros ‘male, man, hero’ (Benkő 1967: 1035, vol. 3). But its Middle Eastern origin is more apparent: Sumerian u (unum) ‘lord, master’ (Deimel 1939: No. 247), ur ‘man, hero’ (Labat 1948: No. 575), Egyptian ur ‘great, superior’ (Budge 1978: 170, vol. 1). Old Hungarian spelling: 1135 ur-; 1184 vr; 1252 Wr; 1419 Ur-. URBAN Urbán [urba:n]. Also spelled Orbán. Derived from the Latin urbanus ‘city dweller’. UREGI Üregi [yregi]. The derivational suffix -i indicates a person from Ürög a settlement in Baranya County now part of Pécs. The toponym Ürög is derived from üreg ‘cave, hollow’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1113 Erig; 1171 Irig; 1551 üreg. URSZULAN Urszulán [ursula:n]. ‘Lion’. Distorted form of the Turkish arslan ‘lion’. The Hungarian oroszlán ‘lion’ is also derived from the Turkish arslan. Old Hungarian spelling: 1318 Vruslan; 1332 Oruzlan; 1369 Orozlan. URUS Urus [urush]. The adjectival suffix -s is affixed to the Sumerian úru ‘to plant, to cultivate’ (Labat 1948: No. 56). Urus may have been the old name of a farmer in Hungary. The toponym Orosháza ‘house of oros’ may be derived from the same Sumerian source. USTOS Üstös [yshtøsh]. A maker or seller of üst ‘cauldron, boiler’ may have been named so. The adjectival suffix -ös indicates occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1395 ÿst. UVEGES Üveges [yvegesh]. A maker or seller of üveg ‘glass’. The adjectival suffix -es indicates occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1530 Iveges. UZO Űző. [yzø:]. ‘One who pursues’. The name is comprised of űz ‘to pursue’ and the participle -ő. The Hungarian űz is almost identical with the Sumerian uš and the Babylonian úz ‘to pursue’ (Labat 1948: No. 211). Old Hungarian spelling: 1454 -wzo. VAD Vad [vad]. ‘Wild, undisciplined’. May have been bestowed on a person from the wilderness. Similar words are in other Ugric languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *βanta ‘forest, jungle’ (Benkő 1967: 1062, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Wod-, Wad-; 1215 Voad; 1372 vad-. VAGI Vági [va:gi]. ‘Dweller by the Vág’, name of a river in historical Hungary confined to Slovakia in 1920 and renamed Váh. The origin of the name is somewhat obscure. Some would derive it from the Old High German wag ‘rough, choppy (water)’ (Kiss 1978: 676). However, the Hungarian vág, the root of vágtat ‘rapid, fast running’, would be more fitting.



108
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1093 Vag. VAJAS Vajas [vajash]. Maker or seller of vaj ‘butter’. The adjectival suffix -as indicates occupation. Similar words are in other Uralic languages, cf. Votyak voj, Finn voi (Benkő 1967: 1069, vol. 3). The ultimate source may be the Sumerian ia ‘fat, fatty material’ (Labat 1948: No. 231). Old Hungarian spelling: 1075 woios; 1200 Uoyos; 1211 Voios; 1253 Wayas. VAJK Vajk [vajk]. The original pre-Christian Turkish name of Hungary’s first Christian king St. Stephen. Turkish spelling would be Vayk, derived from bay ‘sir, rich, leader’ (Németh 1990: 284), synonymous with bey ‘chief, ruler, prince’ (Akdikmen 1986: 49). The word-final element -k is the Turkish diminutive suffix that indicates ‘little prince’. Wealth and power went hand-in-hand in ancient Turkish society. Old Hungarian spelling: 1185 Voyku; 1264 Voyk. VAJTHO Vajthó [vajto:]. A maker or seller of vajtó a basket-size vessel hollowed out of wood (Benkő 1967: 1071, vol. 3). The name is comprised of váj ‘to hollow’, the past tense t followed by an h that marks the reduced plosion of the preceding t and the participle -ó. The Hungarian váj may be derived from the Sumerian bal ‘to hollow’ (Labat 1948: No. 9). Old Hungarian spelling: 1594 vayto. VAJTHA Vajtha [vajta]. A person from Vajta, a locality in Fejér County, may have received the name. It is of Turkish origin derived from bay ‘rich’ (Kiss 1978: 677). An alternative etymology would link the name with the Hungarian váj ‘to hollow’. See above for more information. Old Hungarian spelling: 1150 Boyta; 1324 Vayta. VAK Vak [vak]. ‘Blind’. A blind person would receive such a name. Old Hungarian spelling: 1211 Vocu; 1336 vok-; 1400 Wak; 1448 vak. VALLAS Vállas [va:lash]. ‘Broad-shouldered’. The name contains váll ‘shoulder’ and the adjectival suffix -as that indicates condition. Similar words are in other Finno-Ugric languages, cf. Finn olka, Estonian ola ‘shoulder’ (Benkő 1967: 1072, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1372 vall; 1646 Váll-. VAMOS Vámos [va:mosh]. ‘Customs-officer’, the collector of any duties or toll. Derived from the Persian vam ‘debt, loan’ (Lambton 1988: 173). The Hungarian adjectival suffix -os converts it into an occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1109 Vamus; 1275 Wamus. VAMOSI Vámosi [va:moshi]. The derivational suffix –i indicates a descendant of Vámos. See above for etymology. VARADI Váradi [va:radi]. Also spelled Várady. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a person from Várad a town in Baranya County. The toponym Várad is composite of vár ‘fort’ and the suffix -ad a metathetic variant of the grammatical designator -da that denotes a place. The vár segment may be a derivation from the Sumerian bár ‘sanctuary’ (Labat 1948: No. 344) or bár ‘circular wall’ (Deimel 1939: No. 49). Both interpretations of the cuneiform sign seem to describe a ‘fort’. But according to the Historical- Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language vár is derived from the Iranian vara ‘entrenchment, defense’, Middle-Persian *var ‘fort, fortified place’, New-Persian bar ‘hill, mount, fortress wall’ (Benkő 1967: 1090, vol. 3).



109
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 waradi; 1200 Uarod, Warod. VARGA Varga [varga]. ‘Maker of foot-wear’. Also spelled Vargha. A derivation from varr ‘to sew’ followed by the connecting consonant g and the adjectival suffix -a that indicates an occupation. Old Hungarian spelling: 1389 Varga. VARJU Varjú [varju:]. ‘Crow’. Probably a sign-name, used as an emblem. Similar words are in other Uralic languages. The reconstructed proto-word is *βarɜ. Old Hungarian spelling: 1265 Worre-; 1341 woryou-; 1342 worrew; 1346 Voryu; 1347 Waryu; 1398 Varyu. VAROSI Városi [va:roshi]. ‘City dweller’. Also spelled Várossy. The name is comprised of vár ‘fort’, the adjectival suffix -os and the derivational suffix -i (archaic -y). The reduplicated s marks a stressed consonant. For etymology see Varadi. Old Hungarian spelling: 1224 Waras. VASS Vass [vash]. Derived from vas ‘iron’. The name probably denotes an ‘ironmonger’, but could refer to demeanor or integrity as well. The reduplicated s marks a stressed consonant. Similar words are in other languages of the Uralic language family, the reconstructed proto-word would be *βaśke (Benkő 1967: 1095, vol. 3). Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Wasas, Wosas; 1214 Wos-; 1370 Was-; 1553 Vas. VASTAG Vastag [vashtag]. Also spelled Vastagh. The literal translation is ‘thick, bulky’, synonymous with ‘stout’ when applied to a person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1451 Wasthagh. VATHA Vatha [vata]. The grapheme h marks the reduced plosion of the preceding t. Vata is a variant of Bata [B > V] derived from the Sumerian bad, bat ‘scepter, staff’ (Waddell 1927: 23). Identical with the Hungarian bot both in meaning and phonetic value. The Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a when affixed to vat/bat indicates a leader, a person in charge. The ‘staff’, originally a rudimentary weapon of the ancient warrior, slowly evolved from a wooden staff to a bejeweled scepter and became the symbol of power that endured to the present-day. Titles and names derived from bat, bad denoted leaders, heads of state like Buda, in ancient Magyar society prior to the invasion of the turkish Huns, Avars and Hungarians. The most notable Vatha was the leader of a popular Magyar uprising in 1046 to shake off foreign rule represented by the House of Árpád. That revolt is erroneously referred to by historians as a failed attempt to stop the spread of Christianity. VAZ Váz [va:z]. ‘Skeleton, shell’, but used for denoting a ‘scarecrow’ or a person of skin and bone. Old Hungarian spelling: 1416 uaz; 1577 váss; 1839 vázu. VEN Vén [ve:n]. ‘Old, worn-out’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1403 Wen; 1481 Ween; 1522 Weyn; 1602 Vén. VIDA Vida [vida]. The archaic form of vidám ‘joyful, merry’. The name is comprised of the root vid ‘gay, cheerful’ and the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix -a that indicates condition. Old Hungarian spelling: 1202 Vida. VIGH Vígh [vi:g]. ‘Gay, cheerful’. The word-final element h marks the reduced plosion

of the preceding g. Old Hungarian spelling: 1138 Wig; 1423 Vigh. VILAG Világ [vila:g]. The Hungarian világ ‘world’ has no probable reason to form a surname. It is derived from the Sumerian bil ‘to burn, heat, warmth’ (Labat 1948: No. 172). The cuneiform sign for bil is also pronounced as izi ‘fire’ which is almost identical with the Hungarian izzik ‘glows from heat’. The word világ suggests that the world was originally conceived by Hungarians as any place on earth that is exposed to the light and warmth of the sun. The following words are derived from the root vil: villan ‘flash’; villám ‘lightning’; világ(-osság) ‘light’; világít ‘glow’; világegyetem ‘universe’. A phonetic change from b to v is a recognized occurrence, cf. Greek Basil > Hungarian Vazul > Slavonic Vasil. The original Sumerian bil was preserved in the Hungarian bélyeg ‘stamp, brand (hot iron stamp) imprint’. It was spelled biluk in 1263 and bilig in 1597 (Szamota 19021906: 61). The earliest process of branding involved the use of hot iron, i.e. the stamp or mark on animals, even on humans, was the result of fire and heat, hence the bil segment in the Hungarian word for stamp. The element ág in világ may be the reversed form of the Sumerian –ga. It indicates dependence and is mainly employed in the formation of adjectives (Lenormant 1877: 269). The suffix -ga was active in the Hungarian language at one time, cf.: mézga ‘resin’ from méz ‘honey’. VIRAG Virág [vira:g]. ‘Flower’. Also spelled Virágh. A grower or seller of flowers may have received the name. The Hungarian virág is almost identical with the Sumerian girag ‘flower’ (Labat 1948: No. 483). Old Hungarian spelling: 1412 Wyragh. VIRRASZTO Virrasztó [virasto:]. ‘Vigil-keeper’ or ‘night-watchman’. The root vir is identical with vil, see Vilag above for etymology. The reduplication of r marks a stressed consonant. The causative suffix -aszt is followed by the participle -ó. Old Hungarian spelling: 1432 Virrazto; 1478 Wyrraztho; 1595 Verraztho, Viraztho. VONA Vóna [vo:na]. Also spelled Vonó. Derived from von ‘draw, pull’. The archaic adjectival suffix -a suggests that the form Vóna is older than Vonó which has the presentday participle -ó. A person having an engaging, magnetic personality may have been named so. Present-day form is vonzó. Old Hungarian spelling: 1616 uonno; 1643 vonyó. ZABOLAI Zabolai [zabolai]. Also spelled Zablay. The derivational suffix -i (archaic -y) indicates a descendant of Zabola, Zabla a maker of bridle-bits. The archaic adjectival suffix -a indicates occupation. The word zabla ‘bridle-bit’ is synonymous with the verb zaboláz ‘control, restrain’ Old Hungarian spelling: 1495 Zabala; 1530 Zabola. ZACS Zács [za:ch]. Also spelled Zách. A probable variant of the Sumerian záh ‘to flee, to escape’ (Labat 1948: No. 589). The name may denote a refugee. ZAGON Zágon [za:gon]. The name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. The initial element zág may be derived from the Sumerian zag ‘frontier, edge’ (Labat 1948: No. 332). The word-final element -on appears to be a variant of the suffix -ony used in the formation of nouns. The name, therefore, denotes a

‘dweller near the frontier’. Zágon is also a place name in Transylvania located in the former Háromszék County of historical Hungary adjacent to the old Romanian international boundary. This area was confined to Romania in 1920. The Slavonic source záhon ‘small garden plot’, suggested by the Etymological Dictionary of Geographical Names is not convincing. ZALAN Zalán [zala:n]. Zalán, also spelled Salán, was the leader of the local Magyar population in southern Hungary who resisted the infiltration of Árpád’s Hungarian army in 896. Etymologically the name fits into the Sumerian language. Zal means ‘to persist, to persevere’ (Labat 1948: No. 231) to which the antiquated substantive suffix -án, equivalent of the current Magyar -ány, is affixed. The name denotes a ‘firm, steady’ person. ZASZLOS Zászlós [za:slo:sh]. ‘Ensign bearer’. The lowest rank of commissioned officers in the Hungarian Army prior to 1945. The word zászló ‘flag’ is derived from száz ló ‘one hundred horses’ to which the adjective -s is suffixed to indicate status. According to folklore, each group of one hundred mounted soldiers during the Middle-Ages carried a flag to indicate the presence of 100 ló ‘horse’ i.e. ‘cavalry’, thus the name for their flag. Old Hungarian spelling: 1095 Zaztou [sic]; 1211 Zaaslou; 1587 Zazlo. ZAVAROS Zavarós [zavaro:sh]. ‘Vexing’. Derived from zavar ‘to disturb, to pester’. The adjective -ós indicates condition. Old Hungarian spelling: 1429 Zavaros. ZEGERNYE Zegernye [zegernje]. ‘Quarrelsome’. Old Hungarian spelling: 1803 Zekernye; 1829 Zegernye. ZENG Zeng [zeng]. One who had a ‘rich, vibrant’ voice may have been named so. Old Hungarian spelling: 1240 Zeng-. ZENTAY Zentay [zentai]. The archaic derivational suffix -y indicates one from Zenta a city in the Bácska region of historical Hungary confined to Serbia in 1920 and renamed Senta. The name of the city is derived from szent ‘saint, holy’ which is a Hungarian variant of the Latin sanctus ‘holy’. The word-final element -a is the Sumero-Hungarian adjectival suffix. Old Hungarian spelling: 1216 Zentha. ZILAH Zilah [zila]. The name cannot be etymologized in the present-day Hungarian language. It may be an altered form of the Sumerian silá ‘lamb’ (Labat 1948: No. 252) signifying a peaceful person. It is also a place name in Szilágy County of historical Hungary confined to Romania in 1920 and renamed Zalău. Old Hungarian spelling: 1150 Zyloc. ZOLD Zöld [zøld]. The word zöld ‘green’ is used to indicate a ‘young, immature’ person. Old Hungarian spelling: 1349 Zeld-; 1353 Zeuld-; 1444 zold; 1544 Zöld. ZOLTAN Zoltán [zolta:n]. A derivation from the Turkish sultan ‘ruler, prince’ (Ladó 1978: 229). Originally the title of a Muslim ruler or sovereign (Ahmed 2001: 206). It is present in the Persian language in the form of soltan but listed as an Arabic loan word. Old Hungarian spelling: 910 Zulta. ZOMOK Zömök [zømøk]. ‘Stocky, thick-set’. First recorded as zömök in1767. ZORGO Zörgő [zørgø:]. ‘Rattling, noise-maker’. First recorded as ʒerge- in 1538.



112
Michael Nogrady. 2012. Glossary of Hungarian surnames in Canada
ZSAKO Zsákó [zha:ko:]. Archaic form of zsákos ‘sack-maker’. The name is comprised of zsák ‘sack’ and the participle -ó. Similar words are in the Indo-European languages, cf. French sac, Dutch zak, English sack, but the ultimate source may be the Sumerian sag-kud ‘sack’ (Labat 1948: No. 115) or the Akkadian šaqqu ‘sack’ (Op. cit.). Old Hungarian spelling: 1545 sak. ZSIROS Zsíros [zhi:rosh]. ‘Fat’. The root zsír ‘fat, lard’ is followed by the adjectival suffix -os to indicate condition. This word is shared with the old Turkish çir [chir] ‘fat, lard’ (Clauson 1972: 424). Old Hungarian spelling: 1249 Ziros. ZSOMBEK Zsombék [zhombe:k]. ‘Clump of vegetation in a marsh’, a dweller in such an area may have received the name. Old Hungarian spelling: 1137 Somboc; 1396 Sombik; 1688 zsombék.
