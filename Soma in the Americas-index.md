SOMA IN THE AMERICAS
THE ORIGIN OF A MUSHROOM RELIGION
Carl de Borhegyi Copyright 2010
There is still a great deal of debate among scholars concerning the true identity of the
mystery plant mentioned over 100 times in the Rig Veda called Soma, the only plant /
beverage known to have been deified in the history of human culture, (Furst,
1972:201). The Rig Veda describes Soma as a small red plant having no leaves, and
lacking both roots and blossoms, but having a stem that is juicy and meaty (Furst, 1976
p.97). While the hymns about Soma have come down to us through time, the botanical identity of Soma still remains a mystery.
According to the Rig Veda, a mysterious plant called Soma was the source of an
intoxicating drink of divine immortality known by the same name. Soma is also described
in the Rig Veda as being the father of the gods.

According to the late R. Gordon Wasson, "as early as the first millennium B.C., the real
Soma plant disappeared from Vedic ritual and the name came to be applied to various
substitutes, of which none had the same psychic effects as the original Soma, and all of
which were known at least to the priestly caste to be substitutes" (Furst, 1976 p.98). We are
told that drinking Soma provides great physical strength and stamina, enough so, to pick
up the earth itself, and the power of flight, to go beyond the limits of heaven and earth
(Furst, 1976 p.97). We know that Soma was the focal point of Vedic religion, and that
drinking Soma produces immortality, and that the gods drank Soma to make them
immortal.
"We have drunk the Soma and become Immortal; we have attained the
Light, and found the Gods". (Rig Veda, 8.XLVIII.3)
Ethno-botanist Terrance McKenna, author of the book, "The Food of Gods" , proposed a
theory that the Soma beverage of the Rig Veda was a combination of water, cannabis
indica, and the psilocybin mushroom. McKenna based his theory on the premise that the
Amanita muscaria mushroom is widely recognized to be a poisonous mushroom, and that
the Amanita muscaria mushroom does not produce a hallucinogenic experience.
Above are Hindu-Buddhist figurines from China that I propose encode the Amanita
muscaria mushroom..."Hidden in Plain Sight".
Over the years the author has found an abundance of archaeological evidence supporting
the proposition that Mesoamerica, the high cultures of South America, and Easter Island
shared, along with many other New World cultures, elements of a mushroom based belief
system, and like the Vedic god Soma of ancient Hinduism, was worshiped and venerated
as a god in ancient Mesoamerica.
The author's study of mushroom and Fleur de lis symbolism in ancient religious art would
suggest that the cult of Soma, as well as other Vedic traditions, migrated to the Americas
sometime around 1000 B.C. and that the Indians of the New World modeled their religion
on Vedic beliefs and ritual practices. Mushrooms were so cleverly encoded in the religious
art of the New World, and the Old World, "Hidden in Plain Sight" that prior to this study
they virtually escaped detection.



Amanita muscaria mushroom encoded in ancient Hindu-Buddhist art.
Quoting the late Dr. Robert Heine Geldern...
“ Future research will probably indicate that Asiatic influences changed the
whole structure of native society and transformed the ancient tribal culture
[Mesoamerica] into civilization more or less comparable to those of the Old
World.” (From Man Across the Sea; Problems of Pre-Columbian Contacts,
1971, third printing 1976)
Mesoamerica (Paul Kirchhoff, 1942) is a term used that defines those areas of Mexico and
Central America that witnessed the development of advanced pre-Columbian civilizations
such as the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, Teotihuacano, Toltec, Mixtec, and Aztec, all of which
shared a number of interrelated cultural traits involving religious concepts, ritualism,
architecture, arts, and crafts, hieroglyphic writing, and calendrics" (Charles Gallenkamp,
1959, revised 1985 p.3).
The great religions of the Old World are derived from Vedism, the Vedas being the sacred
texts that were introduced into the Asian subcontinent around 1500 BCE. by the so called
Aryans (Sanskrit for noble) that postdated the Harappa/Indus civilization. Harappan
civilization, the earliest in South Asia flourished approximately 2500-1500 BCE. In
Zoroastrian religion, the same sacred plant god was known as Haoma. Like Soma, this
plant deity played a major role in Persian culture and mythology. The Vedas being the
sacred texts of the Aryans, covering the hymns of esoteric knowledge and rituals based on
supernatural revelations, dating back to approximately 3500 BCE., that include the Rig
Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda, and the Yajur Veda.



Shiva or Siva, the "Auspicious One" is the Supreme being in Hindu religion who
creates, protects and transforms the universe. Portrayed above holding a divine
mushroom (Soma?), Shiva is "the transformer" within the Trimurti, the Hindu
Trinity, that includes Brahma and Vishnu.
Buddhism is named for its reputed founder Gautama also known as Siddharatha
Gautama, who came to be known as the Buddha, an Indian prince of the 6th century
B.C. Above is the figurine of Gautama Buddha under what appears to me to be an
encoded mushroom. According to legend, Buddha eventually reaches Nirvana or
enlightenment, under the bodhi tree but only after he dies from eating a poisonous
mushroom.
Quoting Scott Hajicek-Dobberstein......
"In the legendary biographies of some Buddhist adepts from the 2nd- and
9th-centuries there are some clues which can be interpreted to reveal that
the adepts were consuming psychedelic Amanita muscaria, 'fly agaric',
mushrooms to achieve enlightenment." (from Hajicek-Dobberstein 1995,
Soma siddhas and alchemical enlightenment: psychedelic mushrooms in
Buddhist tradition)

Ethno-archaeologist Dr. Robert Heine Geldern...
"The influences of the Hindu-Buddhist culture of southeast Asia in Mexico
and particularly, among the Maya, are incredibly strong, and they have
already disturbed some Americanists who don't like to see them but cannot
deny them....Ships that could cross the Indian Ocean were able to cross the
Pacific too. Moreover, these ships were really larger and probably more sea



worthy than those of Columbus and Magellan" (from "Man across the Sea"
Problems of Pre-Columbian Contacts, published in 1971)
Today trans-oceanic contact between the hemispheres prior to the voyages of Columbus
is still considered highly unlikely despite the exception of the Viking outpost discovered in
Newfoundland in the 1960's, and the recent awareness that early humans reached far
distant Australia by boat, possibly as early as 50,000 years ago.
Most historians believe that maize, or corn was domesticated in the Tehuacan Valley of
Mexico, by the Olmec and Maya civilizations around 2500 BC. It was only after the
voyages of Columbus in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, that explorers and traders
carried maize back to Europe and introduced it to other countries.
In the monumental book titled, "Man across the Sea" Problems of Pre-Columbian
Contacts, published in 1971 from a symposium held in May of 1968, during the national
meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Herbert G. Baker (page 436), one of the
many contributing authors writes that carbonized maize grains and their impressions upon
potsherds were found in (Kashmir), India to be pre-Columbian (see Vishnu-Mittre, 1966).
Quoting archaeologist John L. Sorenson...
"Maize or American Indian corn was represented in pre-Columbian times
in the sacred art of India at over a hundred temples, as well as in Java. At
least four Sanskrit names for maize are recorded in India, and botanical
evidence from corn varieties grown in remote areas of south and east Asia
confirm the crop’s very early presence there. Zea mays was also known in
medieval Arabia as shown by a lexical entry. (It is uncertain whether the
Asian maize came from Mesoamerica or from elsewhere in the New
World.)" (source, Sino-Plantonic Papers, Number 195, Dec. 2009)
The Mushroom as the Medium:
The esoteric art style of encoding mushroom imagery in religious art, along with certain
motifs like the Fleur de lis symbol, has led me to conclude that the hallucinogenic
mushroom cult of the New World did not develop independently, but rather, it was brought
to the New World, long before the voyages of Christopher Columbus.
It was easy to understand, however, why mushroom imagery had not been noted earlier.
On many vase paintings and figurines the images of mushrooms, or images related to
mushrooms, were so abstract, and so intricately interwoven with other complex and



colorful elements of Mesoamerican mythology and iconography, that they were, I believe,
quite deliberately in an effort to conceal this sacred information from the eyes of the
uninitiated.
After viewing the visual evidence, readers of this study may wish to challenge this view of
New World history with a more open-minded acknowledgement of the capability of
ancient peoples to explore their environment and disperse their intellectual heritage to its
far corners.
We know from the Rig Veda, (Veda is a Sanskrit word meaning "to see") that Soma was
an intoxicating plant worshiped as both a god and holy beverage by a people who called
themselves Aryans. As I discovered mushrooms were so cleverly encoded in the religious
art of the New World that prior to this study they virtually escaped detection.

While at first glance the face of the "Weeping Gods" gives the illusion of a deity with
dangling eye-balls. However, if you look closely you will notice that the dangling eyeballs
are actually encoded Amanita muscaria mushrooms, in the upper image and Psilocybin
mushrooms in the lower image, "Hidden In Plain Sight".
Quoting Maya archaeologist Dr. Stephan F. de Borhegyi...
"...fanged anthropomorphic individuals with dangling eyeballs, are
commonly associated with the god Quetzalcoatl in his form of Ehecatl the
Wind God”. ( S.F. de Borhegyi 1980:17)

(Photo of Amanita muscaria, Fly Agaric Mushrooms from Salvia Space Ethnobotanicals)
Quoting R. Gordon Wasson...
"It [the mushroom] permits you to see, more clearly than our perishing
mortal eye can see, vistas beyond the horizons of this life, to travel
backwards and forwards in time, to enter other planes of existence, even (as
the Indians say) to know God."
“The bemushroomed person is poised in space, a disembodied eye, invisible,
incorporeal, seeing but not being seen....In truth, he is the five senses
disembodied, all of them keyed to the height of sensitivity and awareness, all
of them blending into one another most strangely, until, utterly passive, he
becomes a pure receptor, infinitely delicate, of sensations”. (Wasson,
1972a:198; Borhegyi, 1962)
While one can argue that the simultaneous appearance of encoded mushroom imagery in
both the early cultures of the Old World and that of the New World could be the result of
parallel outgrowths of the same Paleolithic shamanistic mushroom cult proposed by the
late Robert Gordon Wasson, there are other, more complex, similarities that suggest
possible transpacific contacts between the two areas. One of these is the method of
extraction of the hallucinogenic drink used in both areas.
Now, after more than a half century of virtual denial by the anthropological community of
the centrality of hallucinogenic substances, and in particular two varieties of
hallucinogenic mushrooms, the Amanita muscaria and psilocybin, I can finally present
undeniable visual evidence of its existence "Hidden in Plain Sight" in the ancient art and
iconography of Mesoamerica.
Quoting R. Gordon Wasson....
"It can of course be argued that the two great mushroom traditions, that of
New World Indians and that of the peoples of Eurasia, are historically
unconnected and autonomous, having arisen spontaneously in the two
regions from similar requirements of the human psyche and similar
environmental opportunities. But are they really unrelated?
After examining thousands of artifacts, a project that would have been impossible before
the existence of the computer and the Internet, I discovered a wealth of mushroom
imagery. Surprisingly, most of this mushroom imagery concerned the Amanita muscaria,
or Fly Agaric mushroom, rather than the better known hallucinogenic Psilocybin
mushroom. Both varieties, however, as well as others were represented. The fact that they
had not been noted earlier is explained by the way these images were so cleverly encoded
into the art that they became almost invisible. Invariably the mushroom imagery was
associated with ritual sacrifice in the Underworld, with jaguar transformation and period
endings, and with the decapitation and resurrection of the Underworld Sun God by a pair
of deities associated with the planet Venus as both the Morning Star and Evening star.
Mushrooms, in fact, are so closely associated with underworld jaguar transformation, and
underworld jaguar resurrection, that they must have been believed to be the vehicle
through which both were accomplished. They are also so closely associated with ritual
decapitation, that their ingestion may have been considered essential to the ritual of
decapitation, whether in real life or symbolically in the underworld.
Quoting the late Dr. Gordon F. Ekholm...



"There are, of course, many problems concerning the kinds of evidence that
have been presented in the area of transpacific contacts, but the principal
difficulty appears to be a kind of theoretical roadblock that stops short our
thinking about questions of diffusion or culture contact. This is true in
anthropological thought generally, but the obstruction seems to be
particularly solid and resistant among American archaeologists." (ethno
archaeologist Gordon F Ekholm...From Man Across the Sea; Problems of Pre
Columbian Contacts, 1971, third printing 1976, Chapter 2, Diffusion and
Archaeological Evidence, by Gordon Ekholm page 54)
Diffusionism: is a term often used to describe the origins of cultural characteristics and their spread from one society to another.
If the identification of the Vedic god Soma, the so-called mystery plant described in the
Rig Veda is in fact the Amanita muscaria mushroom, first proposed by Wasson, then there
can be little doubt that the Amanita muscaria mushroom was indeed the model for the
numerous small stone sculptures found in Mesoamerica known as Maya "mushroom
stones."
(photograph by Dr. Richard Rose)
Quoting Michael D. Coe, today's unofficial "Dean of Maya
studies"....
"These peculiar objects , one of which was found in an E-III-3
tomb, are of unknown use. Some see vaguely phallic
association. Others, such as the late Stephan de Borhegyi,
connect them with the cult of the hallucinogenic mushrooms
still to this day prevalent in the Mexican highlands, and it is
claimed that the mortars and pestles with which the stones are
so often associated were used in the preparatory rites" (The
Maya, 1993 fifth edition, by M.D. Coe, p. 60).
"Soma in the Americas", is a study dedicated to the pioneering efforts of Robert
Gordon Wasson, and my father Dr. Stephan F. de Borhegyi. From the time of their initial
meeting in Guatemala in 1953 until Borhegyi's untimely death in 1969, the two scientists
worked in close cooperation and shared a voluminous correspondence of over 500 letters.
As the result of their collaborative efforts, as well as Wasson's extensive research into
mushroom symbolism in Siberia and Southeast Asia, they surmised that if the mushroom
stones did, indeed, represent a mushroom cult, then the mushroom itself was an
iconographic metaphor, and the mushroom stone effigies would supply the clues necessary
to decipher their meaning.

Stephan F. de Borhegyi, based his theory of a mushroom cult among the ancient Maya on
his identification of a mushroom stone cult that came into existence in the Guatemala
Highlands and Pacific coastal area around 1000 B.C. along with a trophy head cult
associated with human sacrifice and the Mesoamerican ballgame. He supported this theory
with a solid body of archaeological and historical evidence.

Origins of Soma in the Old World and its Similarity in the
New World



The author presents visual evidence of encoded mushrooms in pre-Columbian art that
supports Gordon Wasson's identification of the revered and deified mystery plant of the
Rig Veda, called Soma in Indo-Aryan folklore, and called Haoma in Zoroastrian and later
Persian mythology, as the Amanita muscaria mushroom.
Ethno-mycologist Robert Gordon Wasson...
"What was this plant that was called "Soma" ? No one knows. Apparently
its identity was lost some 3,000 years ago, when its use was abandoned by
the priests. The earliest liturgical compositions of the Indo-Aryans, called
the Brahmanas and put together after the hymns had been assembled,
discuss the surrogates to be used for Soma in the ritual but fail to describe
the original plant."
" I believe that Soma was a mushroom, Amanita muscaria (Fries ex L.)
Quel, the fly-agaric, the Fliegenpilz of the Germans, the fausse oronge or
tue-mouche or crapaudin of the French, the mukhomor of the Russians.
This flaming red mushroom with white spots flecking its cap is familiar
throughout northern Europe and Siberia. It is often put down in mushroom
manuals as deadly poisonous but this is false, as I myself can testify.[3]
Until lately it has been a central feature of the worship of numerous tribes
in northern Siberia, where it has been consumed in the course of their
shamanic sessions. Its reputation as a lethal plant in the West is, I contend,
a splendid example of a taboo long outliving the religion that gave rise to it.
Among the most conservative users of the fly-agaric in Siberia the belief
prevailed until recent times that only the shaman and his apprentice could
consume the fly-agaric with impunity: all others would surely die. This is, I
am sure, the origin of the tabu that has survived among us down to our own
day."
(from Wasson's, Soma of the Aryans: ttp://www.iamshaman.com/amanita/soma- aryans.htm)

The female fertility figurines above are from the Harappa civilization in the Indus Valley
of southwest Asia, and all encode the Amanita muscaria mushroom in their headdresses as
evidence of Soma. The use of mushroom imagery in connection with the head in areas as
far distant as Southeast Asia and Central Mexico (compare with Tlatilco female figurine
from Mexico below) is both striking and intriguing.

In the Rig Veda, Soma, the plant around which the Vedic sacrifices took place, is described
as an intoxicating liquid that was pounded or pressed out of the plant using special
pressing stones, called Soma stones (RV IX.11.5-6;IX.109.17-18).
In the highlands of Guatemala where the majority of mushroom stones have been found,
and where the Amanita muscaria mushroom grows in abundance, archaeologists working
at the Preclassic site of Kaminajuyu discovered nine miniature mushroom stones in a Maya
tomb, along with nine mortars and pestles, stone tools which were likely used in the
mushroom's preparatory rites (see S.F de Borhegyi,1961, 498-504).
While the actual identity of Soma has been lost through time, both its description and the
details of its preparation seem to point not to a plant but to the Amanita muscaria
mushroom. The flesh of the plant was crushed, using “Soma stones,” and the juices were
filtered through wool into large jars. In a like manner, mushroom stones, when they have
been found in situ in the course of archaeological excavation, are often accompanied by stone grinding tools known as manos and metates. Accounts of mushroom ceremonies still
in practice among the Zapotec Indians of Mexico confirm the use of these tools in the
preparation of hallucinogenic mushrooms for human consumption. One must conclude that
these manos and metates were used for the same purpose as the sacred stones described in
the Rig Veda that were used to prepare Soma.
Above are two of the nine miniature mushroom stones found buried together in a
Maya tomb at Kaminaljuyu, along with nine miniature stone metates and manos
(Soma stones?) used in the preparation of a ritual mushroom beverage.
That the Amanita muscaria mushroom may well have been in use in Pre-Hispanic times,
however, is suggested by early dictionary sources which describe a mushroom the ancient
Maya called xibalbaj okox meaning “underworld mushrooms”, and k’aizalab okox,
meaning “lost-judgment mushrooms." The Mayan word for mushroom in Keqchi is ocox
(Spenard 2006:72).



Mexican mycologist Dr. Gaston Guzmán (personal communication) also confirmed the
belief shared by Borhegyi and Wasson, that the mushroom stones from Mesoamerica were
modeled after the Amanita muscaria mushroom (Guzmán, 2002:4).
Quoting anthropologist Peter Furst...
"The connection between these [mushroom] sculptures and the historic
mushroom cults of Mesoamerica has not always been accepted. Though
many mushroom stones are quite faithful to nature, they were, until
recently, not even universally thought to represent mushrooms at all, and a
few die-hards even now, in the face of all the evidence, reject this
interpretation." (Furst, 1972)
Archaeologists have noted the almost exact similarity of an ancient board game played by
the Aztecs called Patolli, and with an ancient board game from India, called Pachisi.
Archaeologist Gordon Ekholm argued that because of the games layout and design, the
game could never have been developed independently on opposite sides of the worlds.
Its hard not to see the similarity in the ancient Indus Valley, Mohenjo-daro mushroom
shaped game pieces with the miniature mushroom stones from Guatemala.

Pottery mushrooms dating to the middle or late Pre-Classic period have been found
with figurines of ballplayers at the archaeological sites of Tlatilco in Burial 154
(Trench 6), and at Tlapacoya in the Valley of Mexico ( Borhegyi 1980). The pottery
mushroom was found near the figurine of an acrobat suggesting that mushrooms may
have been consumed to induce the super-heroic athletic ability and agility. It's
important to note that the pose of the acrobat might represent an East Indian or
Hindu yoga posture or a version of the “Dhanur Asan” “Vrischika Asan” which is an
advanced yoga posture for people doing “Sheersh Asan”. Pottery shaped mushrooms
were likely used in bloodletting rituals.
Pre-Columbian pottery shaped mushrooms are reported to have been found in El Salvador,
and Guatemala in both the highlands and the lowland Maya rain forest and in Mexico in
the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, and Veracruz.
For more on pottery mushrooms see Borhegyi de, S.F., 1963, “Pre-Columbian pottery
mushrooms from Mesoamerica”, in American Antiquity, vol. 28:328-338.



The famous bronze statue on the left, of a young women sporting a club-like hand, is
from Harappa, early Indus civilization and thought to be about 4,500 years old. The
standing female figurine on the right, represents a female ballplayer from ancient
Mexico wearing a protective helmet, and club-like glove and wears what may be a
mushroom-inspired ballgame protective cup and belt.
(For more on "knuckle dusters" or ballgame hand stones and ballgame gloves see de
Borhegyi, 1961: 129-140. (photograph of Xochipala female ballplayer from
Whittington, 2001).
The female ballplayer figurine comes from the archaeological site of Xochipala, Mexico,
Tlatilco culture in the western state of Guerrero, and dates to 1200-900 B.C.E It is now in
the Princeton University Art Museum. Many of the clay figurines found at the Olmec
influenced sites of Xochipala, Tlatilco, and Tlapacoya, in the Valley of Mexico depict
ballplayers holding bats or paddles, or so-called "knuckle dusters" which are over sized
hand gloves like the one depicted above on the female Xochipala ballplayer (de Borhegyi
S.F. 1980, p.24). The earliest known archaeological site from which actual ball game
paraphernalia (stone yoke) has been recovered is El Manati, on the Mexican Gulf Coast
dating around 900 B.C.E. Gerard Van Bussel (Van Bussel 1991 Ibid pp. 256-57) analyzed
the relationship between the Maya words for blood and semen, and concluded that the ball
game may be an allegory of life through dynastic succession, and that the serpent-shaped
scepter found at El Manati may be an insignia of power and kingship.
The ballgame can only be explained as a cross cultural phenomenon, because it
transcended all linguistic barriers in Mesoamerica.
Quoting Maya archaeologist Stephan de Borhegyi...
" the ballgame, and cultural diffusion may be in order"
"While human decapitation was a widespread custom throughout both the
Old and New Worlds as early as the Paleolithic period, its association with
ancient team games seems to have occurred only in central and eastern
Asia, Mesoamerica, and South America (for ballgames in Southeast Asia,
see Loffler, 1955). The use of severed human heads in the polo games of
Tibet, China, and Mongolia goes back at least as far as the Chou Dynasty
(approximately 1100 B.C. -250 B.C.) and possibly to Shang times (about
1750 B.C. -1100 B.C.). By the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.), the polo
game in China had become more refined and human heads were apparently
replaced by balls. However, the custom of using "trophy heads" in the game
must have survived in modern form in marginal areas, as evidence by the
fact that the present day Tajik tribesmen of Afghanistan still use the head of
a goat as a ball during the game (Abercombie, 1968). While more studies
are needed along this line, it is tempting to suggest that the custom of using
human heads in competitive ballgames be added to the growing Pre-Classic
inventory of "trans-Pacific contacts". (S.F. de Borhegyi 1980, p.25)



Anthropologist Dennis Tedlock who translated the Popol Vuh into english has identified
five episodes involving decapitation and self decapitation in the Popol Vuh. In one episode
the legendary Hero Twins decapitate themselves in the underworld in order to come back
to life from. Tedlock mentions that based on evidence discovered by Stephan de Borhegyi,
he does not rule out the presence of an Amanita muscaria mushroom cult in the Popol Vuh
(Tedlock,1985: 250).
Indus Valley Civilization and Mesoamerican wheeled animal toys
The discovery of pre-Columbian wheeled toys, also called chariots (A.D. 300-900) in
Mexico has caused some scholars to re-examine the notion that the principle of the wheel
was never known in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus. Researchers have
already noted the similarities of wheeled clay toys dug up in Mexico with wheeled clay
toys from Mesopotamia, Syria, China, and India. The question remains, of whether the
invention of the wheel, or wheeled toys could have been made independently in both the
Old Word and the New World.

Irwin,1963; 131-135, and for documentation of wheeled animal figurines in the Old World

Quoting Maya Archaeologist Michael D. Coe
"I do not exactly remember when I first met Gordon Wasson, but it must
have been in the early 1970's. He was already a legendary figure to me, for I
had heard much of him from the equally legendary and decidedly colorful
Steve Borhegyi, director of the Milwaukee Public Museum before his
untimely death. Steve, who claimed to be a Hungarian count and dressed
like a Mississippi riverboat gambler, was a remarkable fine and imaginative
archaeologist who had supplied much of the Mesoamerican data for Gordon
and Valentina Wasson's Mushrooms, Russia and History, particularly on the
enigmatic "mushroom stones" of the Guatemala highlands. His
collaboration with the Wassons proved even to the most skeptical that there
had been a sort of ritual among the highland Maya during the Late
Formative period involving hallucinogenic mushrooms" (from the book;
The Sacred Mushroom Seeker: tributes to R. Gordon Wasson, 1990 p.43)
In the groundbreaking book published by Gordon Wasson and his wife, Valentina Pavlovna
Wasson, titled Mushrooms, Russia and History (1957), the Wassons reported on the ritual
consumption of Amanita muscaria mushrooms among Siberian and northern Asian
peoples, suggesting the antiquity of an ancient mushroom cult to Stone Age times.
The Wassons postulated the existence of a belief system, shared by both continents, that
was so ancient that its most basic elements may have been carried to the New World with
the first human settlers. The origin of this Pan American belief system, he believed, was
early man's discovery of the mind-altering effects of various hallucinatory substances
found in nature, among them the Amanita muscaria mushroom. The Wassons surmised that
our own remote ancestors worshiped and venerated a divine mushroom god perhaps 6000
years ago (Furst, 1972, reissued 1990, p.187).
Above are paleolithic petroglyphs from the Chukotka region of Northeastern Siberia
depicting sea vessels that likely skirted the coast of the Pacific ocean, and mushroom
headed figures.
It's generally excepted that before the Pleistocene Ice Age, early humans migrated to the
Americas through the Bering Strait region where Siberia is only a hundred miles or so
from Alaska. Controversy continues as to how early the migrations began, and whether
these early migrants used boats or walked across a land bridge that later flooded. We know
that Asiatic traits filtered through Siberia into the American Arctic throughout the
prehistoric period and have continued to do so among the modern Eskimo (Miguel
Covarrubias 1954, p.150).



Above is a late 3rd-early 2nd millennium BCE, stamp seal from the Bactria Margiana
Archaeological Complex, located in Central Asia. The seal has been described as a
figure holding snakes, when in reality, I believe this figure represents a shaman with
god eye and horns, attributes that are common in the depiction of shamans in ancient
art, and that the so called snakes surrounding the shaman are merely encoded
mushrooms, encoded to portray divine ecstasy and the mushroom as the medium.

Above is a terracotta horse-shaped vessel from Azerbaijan (Maku) 8th -7th century BCE. Central Asia, that encodes the Fleur de lis symbol (Archaeology Museum, Tehran, Iran).



It is reasonable to believe that the redemptive power and divinity of hallucinatory
mushrooms could have spread from one culture to another. I believe that the mushroom
cult as well as the Fleur de lis symbol migrates from the Old World to Mesoamerica
sometime around 1000 to 600 BCE. with the rise of the ancient Olmecs.
Above is an albite-and-jadeite figurine (Olmec culture, 1500-400 BCE.) said to be
from Tabasco, Mexico crowned with a symbol similar in shape and meaning to the
Old World Fleur de lis.
The rise of the ancient Olmec, the first complex civilization in the New World has puzzled
archaeologists for some time. Archaeologists contend that Olmec culture appears to come
from out of nowhere in full bloom at the site of San Lorenzo, in Chiapas, Mexico. Carbon
14 dates place Olmec civilization at San Lorenzo at 1200 B.C.E. (M. D. Coe, 1970, p.21).
The Olmec appear on the scene having already developed a highly evolved system of
writing, where no earlier or simpler forms have been found. Renowned Maya archaeologist
Sylvanus G. Morley, also noted that there was the lack of known direct antecedents of
Maya culture in the Maya region (Morley 1946, p.46). Morley noted writing as a perfect
example, that even in its earliest known forms, it was already a highly evolved system, that
no earlier, simpler forms of writing out of which it might have evolved are known
anywhere (Stephen C. Jett 1971, p.46).
The earliest evidence of a mushroom-based religious cult in the New World, appears to
date to approximately the same time period, around 1000-400 BC, and the beginnings in
Mesoamerica of Olmec culture. This sophisticated culture, with its distinctive art style and
mythology, pyramids and megalithic stone sculpture adorned with the images of gods and
rulers, appeared quite suddenly in full blossom, first along the Pacific coast of Guatemala
and Mexico, and shortly thereafter in what is now the state of Veracruz, Mexico.
The discovery of numerous toad bones in Olmec burials at San Lorenzo suggests that the
ancient Olmec may have used mind-altering substances, such as hallucinogenic toad toxin,
in various ritual practices (Coe, 1994:69; Furst, 1990: 28; Grube, 2001:294). It was
reported by Thomas Gage that the highland Pokmam Maya added toads to their fermented
beverages to strengthen the results (Sharer/Morley, 1983 p.484) Mushroom-shaped stones,
many bearing toad images carved on their base, have been found throughout Mesoamerica,
in the areas of Chiapas, Mexico, Highland Guatemala, and along the Pacific slope as far
south as El Salvador (de Borhegyi, 1957, 1961, 1963, 1965a, 1965b).
Above is toad receptacle and effigy mushroom stone from Highland Guatemala.



Gordon Wasson was the first to call attention to the pervasiveness of the toad and it's
association with the term toadstool, with the intoxicating or poisonous Amanita muscaria
mushrooms in Europe. The Amanita muscaria mushroom is considered a poisonous and
deadly mushroom, however human deaths from eating the mushroom are rare. Maya art
historian,Tatiana Proskouriakoff demonstrated that the upended toad in Maya iconography
is the symbol of rebirth (Coe, 1993:196).
Ethno-Mycologist R. Gordon Wasson...
"In the association of these ideas we strike a vein that must go back to the
remotest times in Eurasia, to the Stone Age: the link between the toad, the
female sex organs, and the mushroom, exemplified in the Mayan languages
and the mushroom stones of the Maya Highlands. Man must have brought
this association across the Bering Strait (or the land bridge that replaced it
in the ice ages) as part of his intellectual luggage.”
Above is a Type C mushroom stone, depicting a mushroom (toadstool), emerging from the
mouth of an upended toad. Mushroom stones bearing toad images carved on their base
have been found throughout Chiapas, Mexico, the Guatemala highlands, and along the
Pacific slope as far south as El Salvador (Borhegyi, 1957, 1961, 1963, 1965a, 1965b). The
late Maya art historian Tatiana Proskouriakoff demonstrated that in Mayan hieroglyphs the
upended toad represents the symbol of rebirth (Coe, 1993:196).
Quoting from ethno-archaeologist Peter T. Furst:
"It is tempting to suggest that the Olmecs might have been instrumental in
the spread of mushroom cults throughout Mesoamerica, as they seem to
have been of other significant aspects of early Mexican civilization......" It is
in fact a common phenomenon of South American shamanism (reflected
also in Mesoamerica) that shamans are closely identified with the jaguar, to
the point where the jaguar is almost nowhere regarded as simply an animal,
albeit an especially powerful one, but as supernatural, frequently as the
avatar of living or deceased shamans, containing their souls and doing good
or evil in accordance with the disposition of their human form" (Furst
1976, pp. 48, 79)."
There are many striking similarities in the art of the Old World, and that of the New World.
Surprisingly, as I discovered, the ancient symbol that we have come to recognize as the
Fleur de lis appears in the art of Mesoamerica at approximately the same time in history as
the rise of the ancient Olmecs. Perhaps not so surprisingly, the emblem of the Fleur de Lis
in Olmec art and iconography carries the same symbolism of "Lord", and divine



immortality as in the Old World, linked to a Trinity of gods, and Tree of Life, and a
forbidden fruit.
Above is an Olmec influenced Zapotec urn from (Tomb 7) Monte Alban, in Oaxaca
Mexico. The urn portrays a ruler or deity with facial features that appear
remarkably similar to those found in the cultures of Asia. The ruler or deity
portrayed on the urn is depicted with the familiar "Olmec snarl" symbolism of a
snarling jaguar, and crowned with a symbol of rulership and divinity that I propose
represents a New World version of the Old World Fleur de lis emblem. (photograph of Zapotec urn from http://roadslesstraveled.us/monte-alban/)
The earliest evidence of writing in Mesoamerica appears on a stelae at the ancient Zapotec
ceremonial site of Monte Alban. New evidence would suggest that the ceremonial center at
Monte Alban, was Olmec influenced, and begins to develop under Olmec influence about
700-800 B.C. Radiocarbon dates by Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus, of the oldest
Zapotec palisade, range between 1680 and 1410 B.C.E. (Charles C.Mann 2006, p.237).
The stelae with inscriptions officially known as the danzante with glyphs (or Monument 3
at San Jose Mogote), was carved sometime around 600 B.C. (Josephy 1991, p.159).
Spanish chronicler Pedro Perez de Zamora, in his "Relacion de Teticpac", Papeles de
Nueva Espana 1580, reported the use of sacred mushrooms among the Zapotec Indians, in
the Valley of Oaxaca. (Wasson and de Borhegyi 1962, The Hallucinogenic Mushrooms of
Mexico and Psilocybin: A Bibliography, p. 37 1962).
Not enough is really known about the Olmec people, the language which they spoke, what
they may have called themselves, and where this ancient civilization originally came from.
Aztec poems recorded by Spanish scribes, speak of a land called Tamoanchan, which
translated from the Mayan language means "Land of the Serpent". It was said that "this
was a land settled long before the founding of Teotihuacan, where there was a government
for a long time, and it was a paradise of gods, ancestors, and humans".
We know very little about the religious beliefs of the Olmecs and their contemporary
neighbors, other than that they apparently revered the hallucinogenic Amanita muscaria
mushroom, which they portrayed in small stone sculptures known as Mushroom Stones
and also depicted in association with pottery figurines. It is likely that they also practiced
ritual decapitation in connection with an esoteric cult of the human head associated with
trophy heads, and with the Mesoamerican ballgame. As the first complex religion in
Mesoamerica, the Olmec set the tone for future religious developments throughout much
of the New World.
The powerful unitary religion of the Olmec, appears to spread quickly throughout the New
World with certain elements of the belief system that spread as far as the Andean area of
South America. We know this culture by its powerful art style featuring adult and baby
"were-jaguars;" an art style so pervasive that it led the late archaeologist Matthew W.
Stirling in 1955 to call the Olmec the "people of the jaguar." He speculated that the Olmecs
believed that at some time in their mythical past a jaguar had copulated with, and
impregnated, a human female.



(Photo of Olmec whistle by Higinio Gonzalez of Puebla, Mexico) (Photo of Amanita muscaria mushroom from Royalty Free Stock Photos)
The photograph above is of an Olmec whistle, that most likely comes from the San
Lorenzo phase of Olmec culture, 1200-400 B.C.E. These infantile baby-faced
figurines, many of which depict the symbolism of a snarling jaguar, and facial
features that appear remarkably similar to those found in the cultures of Asia, are a
distinctive feature in Olmec art. This figure appears to represent a baby holding on to
a tree or gigantic Amanita muscaria mushroom. According to ethno-mycologist
Gastón Guzmán, one of the effects of the Amanita muscaria mushroom experience is
to see objects as gigantic in size. (Guzman, 2010).
In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, it was reported by natural scientists and travel
writers of the shamanistic use of Amanita muscaria mushrooms among certain tribes in
Siberia, and the curious practice of secondary intoxication with urine suffused with
Amanita muscaria mushrooms (Furst, 1972 ix).
Berthold Laufer an anthropologist and historical geographer with an expertise in East
Asian languages, demonstrated that the word shaman is of Turkish-Tungusian origin in
contrast to earlier beliefs that it came from Sanskrit, and that it was introduced to Siberia
by Buddhist monks.
Siberian shamanism incorporates ecstatic trances brought on by a ritual of dance and the
inducement of hallucinations, most commonly through the consumption of Amanita
muscaria mushrooms. The intention was to open communication directly with the spirit
world, often through a form of animal transformation. In both Siberia and Mesoamerica
the divine mushroom speaks through the voice of the shaman (Wasson 1980, p.52).
To this day Siberian shamans still encode the bright red with white spots, the colors of the
Amanita muscaria mushroom in their ceremonial attire (Tatina the Evensk shaman from
Kamchatka).



The Lukhang murals of ancient India depict scenes that may represent
Amanita muscaria mushroom (Soma?) worship. The Vedas' repeatedly
mention that Soma grows high in the mountains. All the above shamans,
or priests wear clothes I believe are encoded with the colors of the
Amanita muscaria mushroom.
The shaman's goal is to achieve divine ecstasy, the mushroom being the medium to
communicate with the spirit world. The shamans in the Lukhang murals appear to be in
ecstatic trance. It should be noted that the artist's symbolic reference of a rabbit in the
moon, is a similar motif found in Mesoamerican art. Compare the images of the rabbit in
the moon in the Lukhang murals of ancient India, with the Aztec version of the rabbit in
the moon in the pre-Conquest Codex Borgia. Also note that the Lukhang murals also
portrays a shaman sitting next to what looks like a ritual bundle, a common motif often
depicted in pre-Columbian art. The similarities between Asian and American shamanism
are far too numerous to be explained away as mere coincidence (Furst , 1972 p.82).

In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, travel writers and natural scientists described the
ritual use of Amanita muscaria mushrooms among certain tribes in Siberia, and on the curious practice of secondary intoxication with urine suffused with Amanita muscaria
mushrooms (Furst, 1972 ix).
The most famous literary account of urine intoxication suffused with Amanita muscaria
mushrooms was presented by Oliver Goldsmith in 1762, regarding the use of Amanita
muscaria mushrooms in northeastern Asia by the Tungus, Yakuts, Chukchies, Koryaks, and
Kamchadales tribes. Among the Khanty peoples of Western Siberia only the head or cap of
the Amanita muscaria mushroom is eaten. One Amanita muscaria mushroom was a prize
that was traded for with as many as four reindeer. According to Goldsmith "a rich owner of
mushrooms would have a woman chew a couple of the mushrooms into a sausage, which
the male would ingest. Then when he walked outside to relieve himself later, the urine was
saved in a wooden pot and reused. Apparently the active substances are even more potent
in the urine than in the original material. The tradition was called "passing the pot." An
entire village could remain high for a week on one to several mushrooms." (from
Literary accounts of Amanita muscaria mushroom rituals in northeastern Asia,
Goldsmith from http://wikicompany.org/wiki/911:Entheogens)
Ethno-archaeologist Peter Furst...
"It happens that not only Siberian shamans but their reindeer as well were
involved with the sacred mushrooms. Several early writers on Siberian
customs reported that reindeer shared with man a passion for the
inebriating mushroom, and further, that at times the animals urgently
sought out human urine, a peculiarity that greatly facilitated the work of the
herders in rounding them up—and that might just possibly have assisted
their reindeer-hunting ancestors in early efforts at domestication:
. . these animals (reindeer) have frequently eaten that mushroom, which



they like very much. Whereupon they have behaved like drunken animals,
and then have fallen into a deep slumber. When the Koryak encounter an
intoxicated reindeer, they tie his legs until the mushroom has lost its
strength and effect. Then they kill the reindeer. If they kill the animal while
it is drunk or asleep and eat of its flesh, then everybody who has tasted it
becomes intoxicated as if he had eaten the actual fly agaric. (Georg Wilhelm
Steller, 1774, in Wasson, 1968: 239-240)
I found plenty of evidence that the hallucinogenic Amanita muscaria mushroom, like the
Vedic god Soma, was worshiped and venerated as a god in ancient Mesoamerica. (photo on
the left by Mitchell Gomez; mitchellegomez.com) (photo on the right by Thomas
Alexander)
Aztec figurine now in the collection of the National Museum in Mexico City, of the
Aztec god of flowers Xochipilli, whose name in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs,
means "Prince of Flowers." This figurine I believe, clearly holds the Amanita
muscaria mushrooms in each hand.
The Aztec deity Xochipilli, may have been an aspect of a young Lord Quetzalcoatl, and the
patron deity of sacred mushrooms and hallucinogenic plants. Xochipilli was also known as
Macuilxochitl, meaning "five flowers". Note the headdress of Xochipilli which contains
two adornments of five plumes each--a possible reference or code to what scholars call the
"fiveness" of Venus, referring to the five synodic cycles of Venus identified in the Venus
Almanac of the Dresden Codex.
According to Spanish chronicler Fray Diego Duran, (The Aztecs,1964, p.149) it was
written that before Quetzalcoatl departed his beloved Tula, he left orders that his figure be
carved in wood and in stone, to be adored by the common people. “They will remain as a
perpetual memorial to our greatness in the way that we remember Quetzalcoatl”.
I discovered that in the folklore and mythology of ancient Mesoamerica, a bearded gnome
appears to be esoterically linked with the Amanita muscaria mushroom, just as it is
throughout the Old World. According to Stephan de Borhegyi....
"The little red topped mushroom with white polka dots occur frequently in Hungarian
folktales, usually in connection with little dwarfs who live under them" (letter from
Borhegyi to Wasson April 29th, 1953 Wasson archives, Harvard University)

individual sitting under a gigantic Amanita muscaria mushroom. The figurine, which
is 7.5 cm tall, is now in the INAH Regional Museum in Guadalajara, Mexico. One of
the effects of the Amanita muscaria mushroom experience is to see objects as gigantic
in size. According to Gordon Wasson, among the various tribes in Siberia where the
inebriating mushroom Soma has survived, words used for, or to describe the Amanita
muscaria mushroom personify it as "little men." The photo of the Amanita muscaria
mushroom was taken by : © Michael Wood.
The Spanish friars, Dominican friar Diego Durán (1964, 225-6), Fray Bernardino de
Sahagun (1947,:239, 247), and Fray Toribio de Benavente (Motolinía) ,(1858, Vol. I: 23),
who first reported the ceremonial use of psychogenic mushrooms among the Aztecs were
sparing with their words and inevitably condemnatory in their description of mushroom
“intoxication.” They were, in fact, repulsed by the apparent similarities of the mushroom
ceremony to Christian communion.
The Spanish clergy and Conquistadors were understandably horrified at what they
interpreted as a devil-inspired misinterpretation of the Holy Eucharist. In the years that
followed the Spanish Conquest, all aspects of native ceremonial life were banned, temples
and idols were destroyed, and hundreds of their colorfully illustrated books, known as
codices, were burned. Despite these official sanctions, however, some conscientious
historians continued to describe what they had observed, albeit with a heavy dose of
sixteenth century cultural and religious bias.
In 1952, ethno-mycologist Robert Gordon Wasson and his wife, Valentina Pavlovna
Wasson, had learned that archaeologists working at the Maya site of Kaminaljuyu on the
outskirts of Guatemala City had found a tripod stone carving in the shape of a mushroom



bearing the effigy of a jaguar on its base. Sure that it corroborated the existence of a pre
Colombian mushroom cult, (Wasson and Wasson, 1980:75 -178), the Wassons
consulted American Museum of Natural History archaeologist Gordon F. Ekholm, who put
the Wassons in touch with my father, Maya archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi, better
known simply as Borhegyi.
The taller jaguar mushroom stone above on the right was excavated from E-III-3 tomb at Kaminaljuyu.
Stephan F. de Borhegyi, an emigrant from Hungary with a Ph.D. in Classical Archaeology
and Egyptology from the Peter Paszmany University in Budapest, had been invited to
Guatemala in 1948 to study American archaeology by the Carnegie Institution of
Washington. Working under a grant provided by the then Viking Fund of New York
(subsequently the Wenner Gren Foundation) his project was to catalog the extensive
archaeological collections of the Guatemalan National Museum.
While at work on these collections Borhegyi came across a number of small,
unprovenanced carved stone effigy figures that resembled mushrooms to such a degree that
they were called "mushroom stones."
Although the majority of these mushroom stone sculptures were of indeterminate
provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological
investigations as to permit Borhegyi to determine approximate dates and to catalog them
stylistically.
Jaguar effigy mushroom stone excavated from the Pre-Classic Miraflores E-III-3
tomb at Kaminaljuyu.
Quoting Stephan F. de Borhegyi
"My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is
based on the excavations of Kidder and Shook at the Verbena cemetery at
Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave,
discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are



also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the
Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery
association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the
mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom
stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have
circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on
mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons.
Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these Pre-Classic finds
can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following".....(see

Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )
Preclassic mushroom stones from the archaeological site of Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemala
Highlands. Both sculptures depict a mushroom emerging from the back of a crouching
jaguar. Mushroom stones with a double edge or groove on the underside of the cap, have
been dated to the Late Pre-Classic period about 300-100 B.C. by Maya archaeologist
Stephan F. de Borhegyi based on the few mushroom stones that have been excavated in
context at Kaminaljuyu (BORHEGYI, STEPHAN DE: "The enigmatic mushroom stones of
Mesoamérica," M. A. Research Records III. New Orleans, 1959).
In a letter to R. Gordon Wasson, Stephan de Borhegyi writes.....
Dear Gordon,
“I discovered two interesting sentences relating to mushrooms from Indian
Chronicles, written around 1554 by natives. In the Popol Vuh, translated
from the Spanish version by Delia Goetz and Sylvanus Griswold Morley,
University of Oklahoma press, Norman Oklahoma, 1950, page 192. “And
when they found the young of the birds and the deer, they went at once to a
place the blood of the deer and of the birds in the mouth of the stones that
were Tohil, and Avilix. As soon as the blood had been drunk by the gods,
the stones spoke, when the priest and the sacrificers came, when they came
to bring their offerings. And they did the same before their symbols,
burning pericon (?) and holom-ocox (the head of the
mushroom),holom=head, and ocox= mushroom”.
“I think this section definitely indicates that the Quiche used mushrooms in
connection with their religious ceremonies. I even wonder what made the
stones speak “?
“In the annals of the Cakchiquel’s, translated from the Cakchiquel Maya by
Adrian Recinos and Delia Goetz, University of Oklahoma press, Norman,
Oklahoma 1953, pp. 82-83. “At that time, too, they began to worship the



devil. Each seven days, each 13 days, they offered him sacrifices, placing
before him, fresh resin, green branches, and fresh bark of the trees, and
burning before him a small cat, image of the night. They took him also the
mushrooms, which grow at the foot of the trees, and they drew blood from
their ears.”
“The Cakchiquel version therefore also connects mushrooms with
ceremonial offerings to the gods. This mushroom, I think is our anacate, if
it grows at the foot or on the tree”.
(also see Hallucinogenic Mushrooms of Mexico and Psilocybin, A Bibliography: by R. Gordon Wasson
and Stephan de Borhegyi, Harvard University, 1962)
Nine of the ten Preclassic mushroom stones depicted above were found in a cache along
with nine miniature metates at the highland Maya archaeological site of Kaminaljuyu on
the outskirts of Guatemala City. The contents of the cache were dated at 1000-500 B.C.
The tall jaguar mushroom stone on the left was excavated separately at Kaminaljuyu.
The nine miniature mushroom stones in the Nottebohm collection, depicted above, all have
a circular groove around the base of the cap, and are of Early and Late Preclassic period
(1000 B.C.-A.D. 200).



Above is a close up view of the carved relief panel Mahabalipuram India, (full image
below) depicting a dwarf holding what may be an encoded mushroom with a circular
groove around the base of the cap, not an umbrella or parasol ? The word for mushroom in
Sanskrit means parasol "chattra" (letter, Wasson to de Borhegyi 5-7-1953 Harvard
Archives).
Umbrella (parasol) or encoded mushroom ?
Quoting Dr. Carl A. P. Ruck...



"Hence the Soma god [of the Rig Veda] has no name, Soma being a
metaphor of him as the "Pressed One"; and his botanic identity lies hidden
beneath a plethora of metaphors, such as the parasol or wheel with spokes,
both perfectly applicable to a mushroom". (from Sacred Mushrooms of the
Goddess, 2006, p.34)
Above are ceramic figurines that I would argue are all holding a divine mushroom,
and not an umbrella or parasol; all three figurines are from Western Mexico, and
date around 300 BCE–250 CE. (photo on the left, is from American Friends of the

The photo above on the left depicts the deity scholars identify as the Maya Maize
God, known as First-Father, Hun-Nal-Ye. The Maize God sculpture itself is of the
Late Classic period, and is from the Maya ruins of Copan, in Honduras. He makes
what appears to be the same hand gesture commonly depicted in Hindu and Buddhist
art. The Maya artist encodes what looks to me like three stylized mushroom caps, two
as ear plugs associating the sacred mushroom with the number three and the
mythical three hearth stones (or deities) of Maya creation. The photo on the right
represents the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who makes a similar hand gesture. The
Hindu goddess Lakshmi holds in her hands what appear to be stylized mushrooms,



and she wears a headdress with a symbol that looks very similar to a Fleur de lis
emblem.
Stephan de Borhegyi's proposal of an ancient mushroom cult among the Maya met with
limited, highly skeptical acceptance at best, among his archaeological colleagues. Few in
the Mesoamerican archaeological community seriously considered the possibility that the
mushroom sculptures had an esoteric religious significance.
One of the most influential archaeologists of the time, was legendary archaeologist Sir J.
Eric S. Thompson, who was a major doubter of a Maya mushroom cult, ancient or modern.
In a letter to Borhegyi Thompson scoffed at the proposition, arguing that they were more
likely used as stools, though he conceded that they would not have been very
comfortable!
Quoting legendary Archaeologist J. Eric S. Thompson....
"I had heard of the theory that these stones might represent a
narcotic mushroom cult, but I would think it a difficult theory to
prove or disprove... I know of no reference to their use among
the Maya, ancient or modern" (Thompson to de Borhegyi,
March 26,1953, MPM Archives).
Thompson was not unfamiliar with mushroom stones. He had found an anthropomorphic
mushroom stone representing a seated individual with a mushroom cap in the course of a
trial survey of the Southern Maya area. The mushroom looking specimen came from the
Central Highlands of Guatemala. Thompson described the piece as a huge mushroom-like
object that some anthropologists thought to be stone stools. He also excavated and
illustrated several tripod mushroom stones with plain stems at Finca El Baul on the Coastal
piedmont of Guatemala. These he also described as stone seats. (Borhegyi in Wasson,
1962:49)
The ballgame yoke fragment above with footprint was excavated by J. Eric Thompson
along with a tripod mushroom stone from a pit in front of Monument 3 at the Pacific
coastal site of El Baul in Guatemala.
Ethno-mycologist R. Gordon Wasson...
“There is nothing incompatible between the mushroom stones
and the ball game. Those who have mastered the mushrooms
arrive at an extraordinary command of their faculties and
muscular movements: their sense of timing is heightened. I have
already suggested that the players had ingested the mushrooms
before they entered upon the game. If the mushroom stones
were related to the ball game, it remains to be discovered what
role they played”. (Wasson, from Mushrooms Russia & History,
p. 178)
In the years that followed Borhegyi’s death, the existence of entheogenic mushroom
ceremonialism in ancient Mesoamerica, and specifically among the Maya, was denied or



essentially dismissed as inconsequential.
I believe there are several reasons for this lamentable gap in our understanding of
indigenous New World magico-religious origins. One has to be the universal human trait
of selectively “seeing” primarily what is of interest to us, and what we are already disposed
to believe. Another is the well known Western bias against any mind-altering substance
other than alcohol, combined with a great distaste for the widespread experimentation with
psychedelic substances in the 1960s and 1970s that followed Wasson’s re-discovery of
mushroom ceremonialism among the Mazatec Indians of southern Mexico. Fortunately for
future researchers, cultural anthropologist Peter Furst, and a few mycologists, Guzmán,
Lowy, and Schultes and Hoffman, continued to research and publish books and articles on
the significance of hallucinogenic mushrooms in the development of Mesoamerican art
and culture.
Quoting anthropologist Peter Furst...
"The connection between these [mushroom] sculptures and the
historic mushroom cults of Mesoamerica has not always been
accepted. Though many mushroom stones are quite faithful to
nature, they were, until recently, not even universally thought to
represent mushrooms at all, and a few die-hards even now, in
the face of all the evidence, reject this interpretation." (Furst,
1972)
It wasn't as if Borhegyi’s proposal of a mushroom cult wasn't well grounded in substantial,
verifiable evidence. Besides citing his own and others’ archaeological studies, Borhegyi
referred frequently to writings by the early chroniclers who witnessed and recorded what
they saw of native mushroom ceremonies during the early years of the Spanish Conquest.
Their first-hand reports tell us that the Aztecs ate mushrooms or drank a mushroom
beverage in order to induce hallucinatory trances and dreams. During these dreams they
reportedly saw colored visions of jaguars, birds, snakes, and little gnome-like creatures.
(see Hallucinogenic Mushrooms of Mexico and Psilocybin, A Bibliography: by R. Gordon Wasson and
Stephan F. de Borhegyi, Harvard University, 1962)
There are numerous historical reports that link mushroom consumption to such self
sacrificial religious activities as blood letting and penis perforation. In the latter ritual,
blood was drawn from the penis and sprinkled upon the remains (cremated ashes or
exhumed bones and most likely skulls) of deceased ancestors.
The mushroom ritual was probably timed astronomically to the period of inferior
conjunction of the planet Venus. At this time Venus sinks below the horizon and disappears
into the "underworld" for eight days. It then rises before the sun, thereby appearing to
resurrect the sun from the underworld as the Morning Star. For this reason mushroom
induced bloodletting rituals were likely performed in caves, which I suspect was timed to a
ritual calendar linked to the movements of the planet Venus as both a Morning Star and
Evening Star. The mushroom experience, as well as caves and ballcourts were believed to
be entrances or portals into the underworld.
Maya archaeologist David Kelley noted the similarity between the Mesoamerican calendar
and the Hindu lunar mansions. Kelley saw the resemblance between the Mesoamerican
cycle of the Nine Lords of the Night, to the Hindu planetary week of nine days, and noted
the parallel belief of four previous world ages and their cataclysmic destruction (Susan Milbrath, 1999, p.292).
Quoting Maya archaeologist David H. Kelley...
"Much of Aztec religion looks like a modified Hinduism in which one
important change was the deliberate abandonment of religious eroticism"
(Man Across the Sea, 1971, p.62).



In describing the contents of the Kaminaljuyu cache,
Stephan de Borhegyi wrote...
"The cache of nine miniature mushroom stones {depicted above}
demonstrates considerable antiquity for the "mushroom-stone cult," and
suggests a possible association with the nine lords of the night and gods of
the underworld, as well as the possible existence of a nine-day cycle and
nocturnal count in Preclassic times. The association of the miniature
mushroom stones with the miniature metates and manos greatly strengthens
the possibility that at least in some areas in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica
metates were used to grind the sacred hallucinatory mushrooms to prepare
them for ceremonial consumption." (Borhegyi 1961: 498-504)
Borhegyi's studies revealed that mushroom stones first appeared in the Preclassic period in
the highlands of Guatemala and at sites along the Pacific slope. In 1957 he published a
typological breakdown of mushroom stones according to their chronology and distribution
(Wasson and Wasson, 1957) noting that the mushroom stones from the lower
altitudes were of the late type and either plain or tripod. While mushroom stones are absent
from the Classic period, he believed that they may have been re-introduced to Guatemala
and El Salvador in the Post Classic period by the Pipils, another group like the "Tajinized
Nonoalca", or Olmeca-Xicallanca from the Mexican gulf Coast. He postulated that
they may have represented a secondary manifestation of the original idea (Borhegyi to
Wasson, June 14th 1953). Mushroom stones that carry an effigy, like the ones depicted
above of a human (god?), bird, jaguar, toad and other animals,occurred earlier in time and
have been mostly found at the higher elevations of the Guatemala Highlands. This is an
area of woodlands and pine forests where the Amanita muscaria mushroom grows in
abundance. It is more than likely, therefore, that this mushroom was the inspiration or
model for the earliest mushroom stone carvings. The Amanita muscaria mushroom, considered a poisonous mushroom by many (Gerrit J. Keizer 1996, p.156), contains muscarine and ibotenic acid, the toxins or chemicals that cause the powerful psychoactive
effects.
SOMA IN THE AMERICAS



No discussion of the beginnings of mushroom worship in the New World would be
complete without at least a brief mention of possible Old World origins. The prevailing
anthropological view of ancient New World history is that its first human inhabitants came
from Asia but, having arrived and spread throughout the length and breadth of the two
continents, and they developed their own complex cultures totally independent of outside
influence or inspiration. Beginning with Franz Boas, American anthropologists adopted an
essentially isolationist point of view. The peoples of the New World, they argued, were
fully capable of developing civilizations as sophisticated as any found in the Old World.
Suggestions to the contrary were dismissed as, at best, lacking in hard archaeological
evidence, and at worst, fanciful, racist, or demeaning. As a result, Americanists, in general,
have ruled out all considerations of possible trans-oceanic contact as lacking in
legitimacy.
This isolationist point of view was strongly challenged by a number of anthropologists
around the middle of the twentieth century. Among them were Robert Heine-Geldern, and
Gordon F. Ekholm. They argued that numerous Old World-New World contacts may have
occurred, the majority of them by boat.
In the late 1940s Gordon Ekholm boldly proposed that Chinese visitors from the Shang
Dynasty crossed the Pacific and taught the Olmec how to write, build monuments, and
worship a feline god. Ekholm proposed multiple transpacific contacts with the New World
beginning as early as 3000 B.C. He believed that this influence on New World civilization
came from China, or Southeast Asia, and argued that the Chinese, during the Chou and
Han dynasties undertook planned voyages to and from the western hemisphere as early as
700 B.C. Ekholm contends that scholars have underrated the maritime capabilities of the
early Chinese, who not only invented the compass, but used a more seaworthy rudder than
those used in the voyages of Columbus.
Early Chinese texts use the language chhiu, meaning “searching for”, the herb or plant of
immortality, often described as a fungus (source: Frederick R. Dannaway, Entheogenic
Traces in Islamic Mysiticism).
In her book Pale Ink (self-published c. 1958), anthropologist Henriette Mertz noted two
Chinese expeditions to America. Both expeditions are in the Chinese records, one in the
fifth century A.D., and the other, much earlier in the twenty-third century B.C. (Peter
Tompkins 1976 p.352-353). The 5th century Chinese expedition is described by Hwui
Shan a Buddhist monk who reported on the travels of five Buddhist missionaries to a
country far to the east called "Fu-sang", which Mertz and several other historians have
identified as Mexico. According to Mertz, "this 5th century visit to Mexico changed the
entire course of Mexican history" (from Peter Tompkins 1976 p.352-353).
Convincing evidence of pre-Columbian contacts was supplied by Heine-Geldern and
Ekholm and other anthropologists as well as by scholars from different disciplines (Riley,
et al, 1971). In addition to providing examples of probable animal, plant, and technological
exchange between the continents, they argued that most American pre-historians, being
landlubbers, underestimated the ability of ancient seamen to build a craft capable of
navigating the oceans.
These well-reasoned and documented arguments notwithstanding, acceptance by American
anthropologists of the possibility of significant trans-oceanic contacts between the
Americas prior to 1492 CE was not forthcoming. Even with the recent awareness that early



humans used boats to explore their world as early as 50,000 years ago, when they reached
the shores of Australia, this denial has remained as intractably lodged in the minds of New
World archaeologists as the possibility of a New World mushroom-based religion.
In a letter to Gordon Wasson from Carl B. Compton, Director of the Instituto
Interamericano, Denton Texas dated May 27, 1957: Compton writes...
" I can quite understand a reluctance to take part in the current trans
Pacific contact argument. I am personally rather impressed by Heine
Geldern's arguments in favor of it, but would not care to commit myself
irrevocably to such a position." (Wasson Archives, Harvard University)
It is therefore particularly interesting that my study of mushroom symbolism in pre
Columbian art has led me to a number of striking parallels between the visual imagery of
Central and Southeast Asia, and Mesoamerica, and South America, including Easter
Island.
Some of these parallels surely derive from common roots in a Paleolithic shamanic
mushroom cult brought to the New World by the first comers from Asia, as suggested by
R. Gordon Wasson Others, however, appear to be far too sophisticated and complex for
such an explanation.



It may be that these drawings, from petroglyphs found on Easter Island, also symbolize
Venus.
The petroglyph drawing on the right is by Lorenzo Dominguez (1901-1963). When asked
what it meant, the Easter Islanders replied that it represented "Make Make," their creator
god. The petroglyph on the left was found during an expedition to Easter Island led by
Thor Heyerdahl, (cumulus.planetess.com/.../ch18.htg/make.jpg). It appears to me to
represent a twin or dualistic aspect of the symbol in question.
Quoting Gerald Messadie, author of, "The History of the Devil"....
"The equilibrium of the world was maintained through sacrifices and the
ritual offering of Soma, the juice of a plant that could well have been
Amanita muscaria or Amanita phalloida mushrooms. The meaning of that
rite is worthy of reflection: The world exists only on condition that humans
inebriate themselves on certain fixed dates and circumstances, thus
partaking of the nature of gods. This is the basic principle of the Greek
mysteries, and it is also the basis of Judaism's reactive hatred of
drunkenness" (Gerald Messadie, 1997, p.38-39)
Franciscan friar Diego de Landa recorded that the Maya drank intoxicating beverages at
every ritual occasion. Quoting the late Maya archaeologist Sylvanus G. Morley: "The
drunkenness reported by the Spanish was undoubtedly related to an aspect of Maya
ritual not well described in the ethnohistorical documents" (Morley, Sharer, 1983,
p.483).
The drawing above is of a Classic period Teotihuacan III fresco from Teopanzalco,
Mexico entitled "el altar del sol." Encoded in the frieze on both the right and left are
mushrooms, to symbolize the sacred journey of Venus into the underworld as the sacrificial
were-jaguar. The two deities or priests impersonating deities in the scene represent the twin
aspects of the planet Venus as both a Morning Star and Evening Star (note cheek mark).
They appear to be offering their blood in sacrifice at an altar that symbolizes the
underworld Sun God of the present world (note twisted olin symbol in center of sun). The
two priestly characters are dressed as were-jaguars, their outfits decorated with numerous
five-pointed stars which have been identified as Nahuat Venus symbols from highland
Mexico. Teotihuacan's influence over all of Mesoamerica between A.D. 300-700, can be
identified archaeologically by the widespread distribution of Teotihuacan ceramics, which
depict Teotihuacan's patron gods Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc.



The Mexican god Tlaloc can be easily identified by his trademark goggled eyes, feline
fangs, and handlebar mustache. Those who died for Tlaloc or were under his watchful eye,
went directly to his divine paradise called Tlalocan. Also known as "The Master", Tlaloc is
clearly a mushroom inspired god, who shared the same temple as Quetzalcoatl at the great
city of Teotihuacan, and as a Rain and Lightening God, Tlaloc provided the sustenance
needed for everlasting life, (mushrooms) in return for the shedding of human blood on
earth.
Quoting Maya archaeologist Dr. Stephan F. de Borhegyi...
"When one studies Teotihuacan and the far-reaching cultural influences of
this great Mesoamerican tollan, or metropolis, it becomes tempting to
compare it with the impacts of Hellenism on the various Oriental
civilizations that once ruled Anatolia [ancient Turkey], Syria, Persia, India,
Egypt, and North Africa" (S.F. de Borhegyi, 1971 p.81-82)
It must have been a natural step for the ancients to associate this dualistic Venus God,
Quetzalcoatl/Tlaloc, with both life in the upper world and death in the underworld. In his
guise as the Evening Star, Quetzalcoatl/Tlaloc presided over the nightly death of the Sun
God as he sank beneath the horizon into the underworld. (Sharer, 1994:120) Judging by
an abundance of images painted on Maya funerary vases, I believe they thought he was
then ritually decapitated and transformed into a baby jaguar or "were-jaguar." According
to Aztec legend, he was resurrected each morning by Quetzalcoatl as the Morning Star, and
ascended into the heavens on the wings of a harpy eagle. The harpy eagle was thought of
as the jaguar of the day sky being the greatest avian predator of Mesoamerica. The harpy
eagle was most likely the personified form of the katun period (a period of almost 20
years) among the Classic Maya becoming a symbol of the morning sky associated with
human sacrifice and divine resurrection in nourishing the new born sun (Miller and Taube,
1993:82-83).
In the Codex Chimalpopoca, Quetzalcoatl is referred to as a spirit of regeneration and as
the Morning star. A passage from that Codex reads..."Truly with him it began...Truly from
him it flowed out...From Quetzalcoatl all art and knowledge" (Neil Baldwin 1998 p.34).
Venus, the brightest star (actually a planet) in the sky, was visible to early sky watchers
even, at times, during the day. What must have seemed truly fascinating about Venus is
that it appears as both a Morning Star and an Evening Star. As the Morning Star, rising
before dawn, it may have seemed to "resurrect" the Sun from its nightly sojourn through
the Underworld. At night, as the Evening Star, it appears after the Sun's daily "death" and
descent into the underworld. For this reason it became closely associated with death and
resurrection in the Underworld.
Venus also appears to die and rise again from the underworld with great regularity. Every
eight years it can be predicted that Venus will return to the same position in the sky, at the
same time of year in the same phase every eight years" (Milbrath 1999:51). The "fiveness"
of Venus, 5 synodic cycles, comes from the fact that five Venus cycles of 584 days each
equal eight solar years to the day, and that 584 days is the time it takes for Earth and Venus
to line up with respect to the Sun. This day was a period ending day in the sacred 260 day
calendar (almanac) and always ended on the day Ahau or Ajaw. Ahau means Lord.
Ballplayers wore knee pads with the symbol of Ahau, theorizing I guess that the game was
played at the completion of a time period in the sacred calendar, like a katun ending (20 yr.



period) for example which ended on the day Ahau.
The Maya believed that this knowledge was bestowed upon them by the same god who
gave them mushrooms and fire. This god, identified as a feathered serpent and an avatar of
the planet Venus, was believed to have created both the universe and humankind. He
also gave to man the sciences, the calendar and writing, and the knowledge to fix certain
days for feasts and blood sacrifice. Rulers bestowed with this divine knowledge were
believed to be incarnates of this god.
Above is a page from the Codex Vindobonensis, also known as the Codex Vienna.,
believed to be a 14th century Mixtec document, the original of which is now held in the
National Library of Vienna, Austria. The codex is one of the few Prehispanic native
manuscripts which escaped Spanish destruction. It was produced in the Post Classic period
for the priesthood and ruling elite. A thousand years of history is recorded in the Mixtec
Codices, and Quetzalcoatl is cited as the great founder of all the royal dynasties.
It has long been known that page 24 of this Codex concerns the ceremonial role of
mushrooms among the Mixtecs. In 1929 Walter Lehmann noted the resemblance to
mushrooms of the objects portrayed in the hands of many of the characters depicted in this
Codex. Alfonso Caso later provisionally identified what he called "T-shaped" objects in
the manuscript as mushrooms (Wasson 1980, p. 214). Heim later published this page in
color and accepted without hesitation its mushroomic interpretation. In summarizing the
significance of this page, Wasson concluded that it showed "the major place occupied by
mushrooms in the culture of the Mixtecs." Lowy (1980, pp.94-103) added collateral
evidence supporting the validity of these opinions, and extended the base upon which they
rest. More recently, Furst concurred in this opinion after a minute examination and
analysis of the codex.
In the second row from the top, the last figure on the right wearing a bird mask has been
identified as the Wind God, Ehecatl. an avatar of Quetzalcoatl. He is shown bestowing
divine mushrooms to mankind. According to Aztec legend, Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl created
mankind from the bones he stole from the Underworld Death God, whose decapitated head
Quetzalcoatl holds in his hand. Note the tears of gratitude on the individual sitting
immediately opposite Quetzalcoatl. This individual, and those who sit behind Quetzalcoatl
on the left also hold sacred mushrooms and all appear to have fangs. Fangs suggest that,
under the magical influence of the mushroom, they have been transformed in the
Underworld into the underworld jaguar.
In the middle of the page on the right side Quetzalcoatl is depicted gesturing to the god
Tlaloc, (or incense burner venerating the god Tlaloc), directly in front of him, to open the
portal to the underworld. According to Furst who describes this iconography, the scene
depicts the divine establishment of the ritual consumption of sacred mushrooms" (1981,
pp.151-155). He identifies the triangular or V-shaped cleft in the basin of water on the left
as a cosmic passage through which deities, people, animals and plants pass from one
cosmic plane to another.
On the bottom left, two figures stand beside another V--shape portal of Underworld
resurrection. The figure on the left who points to the sky, also has fangs. He appears to be a
human transformed at death into the Underworld Sun god, or mythical "were jaguar". This
gesture probably signifies resurrection from the Underworld. The two-faced deity in front



of him holds what appear to be sacred psilocybin mushrooms similar in shape to the Fleur
de-lis symbol of the Old World.
This two-faced deity is, in all likelihood, the dualistic planet Venus and the god of
Underworld sacrifice and resurrection. Note that the two-faced deity is painted black
(signifying the Underworld) and wears a double-beaked harpy eagle headdress (signifying
the sun's resurrection). The five plumes in the harpy eagle's headdress refer to the five
synodic cycles of Venus. The three mushrooms in his hand refer to the Mesoamerican
trinity: the three hearthstones of creation. ie., the sun, the morning star and the evening
star.
The circle below the feet of the figure on the left is divided into four parts, two of them
dark and two light, each with a footprint. The Fursts, Peter and Jill, have identified this
symbol as representing the north-south axis or sacred center as the place of entry into the
Underworld. This symbol also appears in the scene above in association with a figure
plunging through the V-shaped cleft into the Underworld.
Spanish chronicler Fray Toribio de Benavente (Motolinia) recorded in chapter 24 of the
Memoriales, that the principal gods of Tlaxcala, known as Cholula and Huexotzinco, were
known by three names and that Huexotzinco was also called Quetzalcoatl and Camaxtli.
Motolinía writes that the Holy city of Cholula, where human sacrifices were offered in
honor of Quetzalcoatl, calls into question the legends that describe Quetzalcoatl as
opposing human sacrifice.
The city of Cholula, near Puebla, Mexico in pre-Columbian times was a holy city where
human sacrifices were offered in honor of the god-king Quetzalcoatl. The temple dedicated
in his honor, covered an area of over 500,000 sq. feet making it the largest pyramidal
structure in the world (Hugh Thomas 1993 p.258). A mural at Cholula known as "The
Drinkers", was discovered in 1969 by archaeologist Ponciano Salazar Ortegon while
excavating Building 3-1-A. The mural depicts several individuals in the act of consuming
a very intoxicating, if not hallucinogenic, beverage.
According to Motolinía the Indians of New Spain regarded Quetzalcoatl as one of their
principal gods. They called him the God of air and wind, and built temples to him.
Motolinia goes on to say that "Quetzalcoatl initiated the scarifying of ears and tongue, not,
as was claimed, to serve the Demon, but to perform penance for the sins of evil speech and
hearing. In his Memoriales, (chapter 29), Motolinia describes the great ceremony to
Quetzalcoatl which lasted eight days. Coincidentally, this is the same number of days that,
according to legend, Quetzalcoatl was in the underworld creating humanity by bloodletting
on the bones of his father and the bones of past generations. He then emerged from the
underworld as the Morning star.
.
Recently archaeologists excavating in the lowlands of Guatemala, at the ancient Maya and
Olmec influenced site of Seibal, suggest that around 1000 B.C. a broad cultural shift took
place that now challenges the two prevailing theories of the origin of Mayan civilization.
"The two prevailing theories hold that the Maya either arose independently
in what is now Guatemala, Belize, southern Mexico, and western Honduras;
or that it developed as a result of the influence of the older Olmec culture"
(American Archaeology, summer 2013 by Tamara Stewart).



Above is a drawing of Stela 13, from the Olmec influenced Maya site of
Seibal. Maya archaeologists have suggested that "the Seibal florescience
is based on an intrusion and takeover of Seibal by a group foreign to the
Peten" (Patrick Culbert 1973 p.32). The 3-dot motif depicted on this
monument is I believe, an ancient Old World symbol, referring to divinity
and a Trinity of creator gods, and that the seven-headed serpent motif on
Stela 13, is a motif commonly seen in the ancient art of Hinduism,
Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. The Buddha is often portrayed being
shadowed by a seven headed serpent or “Naga”.

Bearded Buddha sitting under the mushroom of immortality ?
Anthropologist Gunnar Thompson writes that between 500-300 B.C.E., Chinese explorers
sailed down the coast of central America searching for magic mushrooms to take back to
China (D.H. Childress,1992 p.62).
Quoting David Pratt
"By the 3rd century BC, the Chinese were building oceangoing merchant
vessels up to 80 feet long and weighing up to 60 tons. According to the Shih
Chi chronicle, in 219 BC, during the reign of Emperor Shih Huang, a fleet
of ships, led by Captain Tzu Fu, left China for Fu Sang, a far-off land to the
east, also known as the Isle of the Immortals. The purpose was to bring back
the legendary ling chih mushrooms for the ailing emperor. (source
davidpratt.info May 2009)
The Captain never returned home with the mushroom of immortality, and the Chinese
emperor eventually died in the year 207 B.C.



Quoting R. Gordon Wasson...
"Now if, as seems likely, the Chinese once worshiped an hallucinogenic
mushroom and employed it in religious ritual and medicine, and if some of
their sages reached the New World, by accident or design, they could of
course have introduced some of their own advanced pharmacological
knowledge, or at least the idea of sacred mushrooms, to the ancient
Mexicans. The same would apply to early India, whose calendrical system,
like that of China, bears a perplexing resemblance to its pre-Hispanic
Mexican counterpart" (Furst, 1976 p.104).
Similarities in artistic motifs that I would argue indicate a Hindu
Buddhist presence in Mesoamerica, before the arrival of Columbus ?
As the story goes, Buddha becomes enlightened while sitting under the Bodhi tree. The
word bodhi which means enlightenment, is I believe a metaphorical reference to the Tree
of Life or Tree of Knowledge.



Buddha eventually reaches Nurvana or enlightenment, under the bodhi tree but only
after he dies from eating a poisonous mushroom.
The legend of the Buddha is that his conception and birth were miraculous. His mother,
coincidentally named Maya, conceived of him in a dream, and gave birth to him while
standing and grasping a tree.

of Life encoded as the Fleur de lis (from Po Win Daung, Myanmar).



Above is the figurine of Gautama Buddha under what appears to me to
be a Amanita muscaria mushroom.
According to the Rig-Veda, Maya was the goddess, by whom all things are
created by her union with Brahma. In searching for the unknown origin of the
name Maya or Mayan, one should consider the strange coincidence that the
Sanskrit word for the divine power, and enlightenment from the plant god
Soma was called Maya. We are told that the gods themselves were described
as Mayin. Is it just a coincidence that the god Soma, had a son named Budha.
And is it just a coincidence that linguists have identified a number of Sanskrit
words in Quechua, the language of the Inca of Peru (Fox, 2005, p.118).
Above is a female figurine from the Maya ruins of Xelha, in Yucatan Mexico
and now in Cancun’s Maya Museum. In Buddhist art Queen Maya is
portrayed as a beautiful woman in the prime of life. I wonder if this Maya
figurine is one of those "oopart", or "out-of-place-artifacts" that actually
depicts what it looks like, a Chinese woman. In fact I might take this one a
step further, and propose that the female figurine above found in Quintana
Roo Mexico, is a portrait of Buddha's mother, Queen Maya, and that the name
Guatemala, was said to be "the land of the Gautama"., the land where Soma
grows in abundance.
Source: New World Encyclopedia...
In the Rigveda, the term Maya, (maya) is introduced referring to the power
that devas (divine beings) possessed which allowed them to assume various
material forms and to create natural phenomena.
Maya (Sanskrit māyā, from mā "not" and yā "this") In early Vedic
mythology, maya was the power with which the gods created and maintained



the physical universe.
Maya is the power that brings all reality into being as it is perceived by
human consciousness. Therefore, all the particular things contained within this
material world are products of maya.
Soma (Soma), was considered to be the most precious liquid in the universe,
and therefore was an indispensable aspect of all Vedic rituals, used in
sacrifices to all gods, particularly Indra, the warrior god. Supposedly, gods
consumed the beverage in order to sustain their immortality. In this aspect,
Soma is similar to the Greek ambrosia (cognate to amrita) because it was what
the gods drank and what helped make them deities. Indra and Agni (the divine
representation of fire) are portrayed as consuming Soma in copious quantities.
(Excerpt is from New World Encyclopedia)
"We have drunk the Soma and become Immortal; we have
attained the Light, and found the Gods". (Rig Veda, 8.XLVIII.3)
The quest for immortality, was the basis of the ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh.
Above is an image from a Sumerian cylinder seal, 3rd millennium BCE, that depicts a
scene of decapitation in association with the Tree of Life. The grisly scene depicts the
decapitation of the Sumerian deity Humbaba, also known as Huwawa, "Guardian of the
Pine/Cedar Forest". The scene is from the Epic of Gilgamesh, in which god's guardian
deity Humbaba is decapitated by Enkidu and Gilgamesh. I believe that the Sumerian artist
who carved this cylinder seal encodes the secret fruit of immortality, to which Enkidu and
Gilgamesh quest for, as a divine mushroom, encoded in the feet of the deity Humbaba,
"Guardian of the Pine/Cedar Forest".



Fragment showing the Sumerian goddess Nisaba with an inscription of Entemena, ruler of
Lagash ( 2430 BC ).



Above is a Hittite relief carving dated around the 9th-8th century B.C. from Anatolia,
in modern day Turkey. The relief carving depicts a scene of two figures following a
horse drawn cart carrying what I propose is a sarcophagus encoded with three sacred
mushrooms as a symbol of a Trinity and divine resurrection. Its my belief that the
wheel of the cart esoterically alludes or is code for the resurrecting sun or sun disc,
and that the three encoded mushrooms on the rulers sarcophagus esoterically alludes
to a Trinity of gods responsible for the sun and ruler's divine resurrection. It may be
that the two figures on the left following the cart, represent the dualistic aspects of the
planet Venus as both Morning Star and Evening Star, a dualistic star responsible for
the death and underworld resurrection of the Sun God.
The Soma ritual was an integral part of Vedic-Hindu religion where Soma was drunk by
the priesthood during sacrifices. Verses in the Rig Veda refer to Soma as the "single eye",
the eye of the sun, symbolism that can be commonly seen encoded in pre-Columbian art.
The "single eye" motif is a common icon in Mesoamerica, and can be found in the pre
Hispanic codices, as well as in the iconography at the great city of Teotihuacan in the
highlands of Mexico where the god Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, shared
the same temple. The motif of the single eye in the New World may indicate that two very
different cultures came in contact with each other. The single eye motif may have
originated with the Sumerian God Enki who was known as the "Lord of the Sacred Eye" in
ancient Sumerian religion. The ancient Hebrews depicted the sun as an eye, and Hindus
believe that the sun is the "eye of the world" (loka chakshus).



The "single eye" motif was one of the most common symbols in Egyptian art, better
known as the Eye of Horus. The Eye of Horus, was also known as the Wadjet, aka, the
"green one", whose watchful eye protected the pharaoh in the afterlife.
Above is an Egyptian sandstone carving (18th Dynasty 1570-1342 BC), depicting Pharaoh
Akhenaton and wife Queen Nefertiti in profile, with hands raised in the air to venerate

introduced a "new religion" (Soma / Haoma ?) into Egypt, based on the worship of the sun
god Aten. (source of authenticity... http://www.worldwidestore.com/36340c.htm.
Quoting Anthropologist Christian Ratsch...
"The Fly agaric [Amanita muscaria mushroom] has been known since
antiquity. The Egyptians called it "raven's bread," a name which it has
retained in Central and Eastern Europe to the present day. It was said that
Saint Anthony ate this raven's bread before the ancient pagan gods
appeared to him as demons. Among the ancient Germans, the fly agaric was
associated with Wotan/Odin, the god of ecstasy and the discoverer of the
magical runes. According to legend, fly agarics appeared where the foam
from Wotan's horse fell onto the earth. The name raven's bread refers to
Wotan's two all-knowing, all-seeing ravens. According to Graves (1961),
the followers of Dionysos consumed fly agaric during the Dionysian
festivals and mysteries, for it "bestows enormous physical power, erotic
potency, delusional visions, and the gift of prophecy." One author has even
argued that Christianity began as a fly agaric cult (Allegro 1970). There is
also some evidence that the pre-historic "Beaker People" of Stonehenge,
and later the British Celts, used fly agaric in a cultic context (from The
Dictionary of Sacred and Magical Plants).



I found what I would argue is encoded Amanita muscaria mushroom imagery associated
with the Egyptian winged goddess Ma'at.
Hindu Buddhist statues with the Fleur de lis symbol ?
Coincidence or evidence of pre-Columbian contact ?



Anthropologist Dennis Tedlock writes that in the Maya Highlands where the majority of
the mushroom stones have been found, there is a dance drama based on a sacred drink, that
takes place in the town of Rabinal in the department of Baja Verapaz, called the Rabinal
Achí. In the dance a prisoner of war is captured and is granted one last drink, called “the
drink of lords,” before he is ritually decapitated. According to Tedlock there were repeated
efforts by colonial authorities to ban the performances of the Rabinal Achi because it was
considered a dramatization of Maya culture and Maya royalty.
Was the sacred “drink of lords” called Ki’ and “twelve poisons” a mushroom beverage
which, according to Tedlock, brings dreams to the character in the Rabinal Achí?

Above is Maya vase painting K2781, from the Justin Kerr Data Base, drawn by Alexandre
Tokovinine. This and many other Maya vase paintings strongly supports my theory that
visionary mushrooms may have been included in a ritual drink such as the beverage Soma,
and was consumed prior to ritual decapitation. It must have been believed that this
intoxicating beverage would transport the individual to the Underworld in which
underworld decapitation was the portal to rebirth in the underworld and divine
resurrection.
Spanish chronicler Fray Diego Duran ...(Duran, 1971)
“The Indians made sacrifices in the mountains, and under shaded trees, in
the caves and caverns of the dark and gloomy earth. They burned incense,
killed their sons and daughters and sacrificed them and offered them as
victims to their gods; they sacrificed children, ate human flesh, killed
prisoners and captives of war....One thing in all this history: no mention is
made of their drinking wine of any type, or of drunkenness. Only wild
mushrooms are spoken of and they were eaten raw.”
...“It was common to sacrifice men on feast days as it is for us to kill lambs
or cattle in the slaughterhouses.... I am not exaggerating; there were days in
which two thousand, three thousand or eight thousand men were
sacrificed...Their flesh was eaten and a banquet was prepared with it after
the hearts had been offered to the devil.... to make the feasts more solemn
all ate wild mushrooms which make a man lose his senses... the people
became excited, filled with pleasure, and lost their senses to some extent."



Both in the Old World and the New, human sacrifice and the ritual of decapitation was
believed necessary to save mankind from calamity and the cosmos from collapse.Since the
greatest gift one could offer the gods was one’s own life, the purpose of human sacrifice
was to preserve life rather than destroy it. I believe strongly that this concept of life from
death via decapitation was mushroom-inspired. Both Indian and Mesoamerican religious
traditions believed in a three-tiered cosmos with celestial gods traveling back and forth
from the Heavens to the Underworld, and both saw a triadic unity in their gods (Hindu
triad, and Palenque Triad) that was related to such cosmic forces as wind, rain, lightning,
and fire. The early Vedics, Hindus, Buddhists, and Persian Zoroastrians, like the
Mesoamericans, also believed in four great eras or world periods that ended in cataclysm
prior to the present, fifth, and final world.
In the New World beginning around 1500 B.C.E. an ancient people scholars call the
Olmec, appeared suddenly, their art and mythology fully developed and in full bloom, and
they were the first to build pyramids and megalithic stone sculpture adorned with the
images of their gods and rulers. The pioneering achievements of the ancient Olmec in the arts, architecture, and writing give us the first great civilization in the New World.

Above on the left is the Amanita muscaria mushroom, and on the right a Maya figurine
(300-900 C.E.) photographed by Justin Kerr (K656a). The figurine wears a headdress that
I believe was inspired by the Amanita muscaria mushroom. The figurine's contorted face
depicts the "Olmec snarl", a common motif in Olmec art that I believe represents the
mushroom's effect of jaguar transformation and the soul's mythical underworld journey.
The figurine holds in his hands a concave mirror. Mirrors were used by shamans to see
into the past and future and communicate with ancestors and gods. I believe that in many,
if not most cases, this communication was conducted under the influence of visionary
mushrooms.
Olmec magic mirrors are presumably made from hematite-ilmenite, and in 1972
archaeologist Gordon Ekholm succeeded in generating fire from one of the concave
mirrors in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City
(The Olmec & Their Neighbors, 1981 p115).
Magic Mirrors were used by shamans in their rituals to see into the past and future and
communicate with ancestors and gods. I believe that in many, if not most cases, this
communication was conducted under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms. Mirrors
were also a common ritual object in Central Asia, and China, and may have been
introduced into Mesoamerica with the mushroom cult.



Above is a pre-Columbian vessel from Peru, South America that I believe depicts a
priest or shaman holding a mirror in one hand, and an Amanita muscaria mushroom
in the other.

1965,: 73-77; Museum of Primitive Art, 1965.

Quoting R. Gordon Wasson....
“The bemushroomed person is poised in space, a disembodied eye, invisible,
incorporeal, seeing but not being seen....In truth, he is the five senses
disembodied, all of them keyed to the height of sensitivity and awareness, all
of them blending into one another most strangely, until, utterly passive, he
becomes a pure receptor, infinitely delicate, of sensations”. (Wasson,
1972a:198; Borhegyi, 1962)
Above, "hidden In plain sight," the ceramic pre-Columbian mask depicts the
transformation of a human into a "were-jaguar," a half-human, half-jaguar deity first
described and named in 1955 by archaeologist Matthew W. Stirling. The were-jaguar
appears in the art of the ancient Olmecs as early as 1200 B.C. I believe this mask
symbolizes the soul's journey into the underworld where it will undergo ritual decapitation,
jaguar transformation, and spiritual resurrection. An Amanita muscaria mushroom (actual
specimen shown in the photo on the right) is encoded into the head and nose of the human
side, while the left half of the mask depicts the effect of the Amanita mushroom as
resulting in were-jaguar transformation. The were-jaguar eventually came to be worshiped
and venerated throughout Central and South America.

Maya vase K6608 from the Justin Kerr Data Base of Maya vase paintings, depicts three
underworld jaguars which may symbolize the three hearth stones of creation, a "trinity of
gods" in Maya religion known at the archaeological site of Palenque as GI, GII, GIII. The
underworld jaguars all wear sacrificial scarves, symbolic of underworld decapitation that
encodes the colors and spots of the Amanita muscaria mushroom.
The vessel above depicts a fanged deity, holding a sacred beverage in his hands that turns
the "bemushroomed" into a "were jaguar".
The religion of the ancient Olmec was grounded in blood sacrifice, with the need to offer
men, women, and children to their powerful gods. It was believed by all Mesoamericans,
that the greatest gift one could offer the gods was one's own life; a concept of eternal life
from death. It's likely that in Mesoamerica the notion of divine immortality was inspired
by the mushroom ritual. Olmec religion set the tone for all future religious beliefs in the
New World.
Quoting ethno-archaeologist Peter T. Furst:
"It is tempting to suggest that the Olmecs might have been instrumental in
the spread of mushroom cults throughout Mesoamerica, as they seem to
have been of other significant aspects of early Mexican civilization (Furst
1976, p. 79)."
" It is in fact a common phenomenon of South American shamanism
(reflected also in Mesoamerica) that shamans are closely identified with the
jaguar, to the point where the jaguar is almost nowhere regarded as simply
an animal, albeit an especially powerful one, but as supernatural, frequently
as the avatar of living or deceased shamans, containing their souls and
doing good or evil in accordance with the disposition of their human form"
(Furst 1976, p. 48).



Surprisingly, as I discovered, the ancient symbol that we have come to recognize as the
Fleur de lis appears in the art of Mesoamerica at approximately the same time in history as
the rise of the ancient Olmecs. Perhaps not so surprisingly, the emblem of the Fleur de Lis
in Olmec art and iconography carries the same symbolism of divine immortality as in the
Old World, linked to a Trinity of gods, and Tree of Life.
Above, is a Preclassic Olmec (800-500 B.C) relief panel from the south coast of
Guatemala, that depicts a ruler or god-king as a feline deity crowned with a stylized Fleur
de-lis symbol encoded in his jaguar headdress. The feline deity wears a medallion around
his neck, shaped like a capital-T, known as the Ik glyph or symbol, associated in
Mesoamerica with the Wind god Quetzalcoatl, and the Maya Storm god Chac. I should be
noted that the T-shaped Ik glyph is also the same shape as the Aryan Tau cross. In
Mesoamerica this T-shaped symbol is linked to the Sun God and the planet Venus as
Morning Star and Evening Star, and tied to the births of the Maya god GI, (Chac) of the
Palenque Triad, and the Mesoamerican god-king Quetzalcoatl as 9-Wind.
As I will demonstrate throughout, the Ik glyph in Mesoamerica is intimately connected
with a sacred mushroom and a symbol I propose is the Old World Fleur-de-lis.
The first mushroom cult, identified by its powerful artistic expression of the "were-jaguar",
dominated Olmec culture as early as 1500 B.C.E. As early as 850 B.C.E., a were-jaguar
cult begins to appear in South America, identified in the religious art of the ancient Chavin
and Paracas cultures of Peru.
Above is an Olmec jadeite figurine 900-300 B.C.E., that also depicts footprints, and the
familiar "Olmec snarl", symbolism of a journey into the underworld as a jaguar deity. Note
that the jaguar deity is crowned with a trefoil symbol similar in shape and meaning to the
Old World Fleur-de-lis emblem.
While there clearly have been no elephants in the Americas since the extinction of the
mastodon and wooly mammoth thousands of years ago, numerous images resembling
elephants have been noted in Mesoamerican art over the years. A sampling are reproduced
here leading the reader to wonder if the artists who produced the images could possibly
have had any first hand knowledge of elephants.

Above are enigmatic loop-handled ceremonial stone objects found in both the Old World
and in the New World.
The pre-Columbian stone objects above are from El Baul on the Pacific
coast of Guatemala. The loop-handled stone object on the right (b)
formerly known as a "padlock stone" or "sling stone" was later
designated " ball-game handstone" by Maya archaeologist Stephan F. de
Borhegyi in 1961. Borhegyi "christened" the stone objects "ball game
handstones" because of their archaeological association with such well
known Mesoamerican artifacts as palmate stones, stone yokes, and thin
stone heads called hachas, clearly indicates their connection with pre
Columbian ball-game ceremonies or with the game itself (de Borhegyi
1964, Pre-Columbian Ball-game Handstones: Rejoinder to Clune, p.84).
According to Stephan de Borhegyi....



"The opposing teams may have represented the opposing forces (or dualism
?) of sun and rain (costumed as eagles or sun vultures and jaguars
respectively) with the predictable outcome that the team representing rain
and fertility would ultimately triumph. If the ball game were rain-producing
pantomime enacted at the beginning of the rainy season to insure the
growth of crops, it would help to explain its close association with such rain,
wind, and fertility deities as Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Xolotl, Xipe Totec, and
Xochipilli, and its connection with death and rebirth through human
sacrifice by decapitation or other methods. It is even possible that, at least
during the Classic period, the game served primarily as a mechanism for
selecting the proper person (s) for the annual spring and fall sacrifices. All
this, of course, is pure speculation for we have no eyewitness accounts or
written records of the ball game as it was played in Classic or pre-Classic
times" ( from de Borhegyi, Pre-Columbian Ball-game Handstones:
Rejoinder to Clune, 1964 p.86).
In southern India, we find megalithic stone sculptures called kuda-kallu (umbrella stones)
which strongly resemble giant mushrooms, dating approximately 1000 B.C. to 100 B.C.
According to eminent scholar Giorgio Samorina (Integration, vol. 6, pp. 33-40, 1995) the
megalithic kuda-kallu are found in an area where the Amanita muscaria mushroom grows.
These megalithic stone sculptures, when seen from the sky at sites like Kerala in south eastern India, look like large mushroom patches.
India's Kuda-kallu: umbrella-stones or mushroom-stones?
(Photo above of kuda-kallu, or mushroom-shaped megalith from http://www.indianetzone.com /22/mangadu_an_archaeological_site_india.htm)
Bicephalic or two-headed birds are a common theme in Hindu mythology as they are in
Pre-Columbian art. The antiquity of the double headed bird in Hindu mythology may date back as far as 2000 BC. In Mesoamerica two-headed birds and/or two-headed serpents are
linked to both accession and rulership, as well as to the dualistic nature of the planet Venus
(see Codex Vindobonensis page 24). Two-headed birds and two headed feline-looking
serpents commonly represent Quetzalcoatl as both the Morning Star and Evening Star.
Many years ago Eduard Seler linked the jaguar-bird-serpent god associated with Venus
and warfare to the god Quetzalcoatl as the Morning Star (Miller and Taube, 1993
p.104).



The two headed mythological bird of Hindu mythology called the Gandaberunda, above
(also known as the Berunda) is a common motif in Hindu temples, Rameshwara temple
India.
Above is an ancient textile from Peru, South America Paracas culture 800 BCE and 100
BCE., depicting a double-headed bird.



Above is a Classic period Maya stamp depicting a two-headed bird, from highland
Guatemala. (From Galería Guatemala: Sellos Preshipánicos (Guatemala: Editorial Galería
Guatemala, 2011), 45.]http://blogs.uoregon.edu/mesoinstitute/about/curriculum-unit

Many years ago Eduard Seler linked the jaguar-bird-serpent god of Mesoamerica with the
planet Venus and warfare, and to the god Quetzalcoatl as the Morning Star (Miller and
Taube, 1993 p.104).
The first depictions of double-headed birds and serpents in Mesoamerica goes back to
Olmec times, with both deriving from the Olmec Dragon. This mythical creature
represents the principal sky god who may derive zoomorphically from the harpy eagle
(Miller and Taube, 1993 p.126). Images of two-headed birds and serpents are found
throughout Mesoamerica and South America, and are also commonly found in rock art on
remote Easter Island. The antiquity of the double headed bird in Hindu mythology may
date back as far as 2000 BC. Many years ago Eduard Seler linked the jaguar-bird-serpent
god associated with Venus and warfare to the god Quetzalcoatl as the Morning Star
(Miller and Taube, 1993 p.104).
The Aztecs referred to mushrooms as flowers (Wasson, 1980 p.79).
Quoting R. Gordon Wasson...
"The flowers took them to another world where they sang their Aztec poetry to the
music of their Aztec instruments, a world that they called their Tlalocan (or sometimes
their Tamoanchan), a world of strange and wondrous beauty, where they reveled in
sensations beyond imagining".
(Compare the genesis myth the Nasadiya, the Rig Veda's "Hymn of Creation" (X:129) with the, Rig Veda Americanus, Sacred songs of the ancient Mexicans, with a gloss in Nahuatl, edited, with a paraphrase, notes and vocabulary, by Daniel G. Brinton 1890 (Produced by David Starner, Ben Beasley and the PG Online Distributed Proofreading Team Gutenberg E-book online)
Flowers symbolize a state of the soul on its journey to full godhood and Teonanacatal, the
mushroom of the Aztecs, was called "the flower that makes us drunk" (Nicholson 1967,
p.90). Fray Diego Duran writes that war was called xochiyaoyotl, which means "Flowery
War". Death to those who died in battle was called xochimiquiztli, meaning "Flowery
Death" or "Blissful Death" or "Fortunate Death".
There is a Nahua legend in ancient Mexico of a paradise of nine heavens that was
dedicated to their god Quetzalcoatl, called Tamoanchan where there was a sacred tree that
marked the place where the gods were born and where sacred mushrooms and all life
derived (Hugh Thomas 1993, p.474). Aztec legends also relate that the sun, as a
jaguar, descends each night into the underworld to battle the forces of death in order to



return, triumphant, each morning to the sky on the wings of an eagle.
In Chinese mythology, Mount Penglai is the legendary land of immortals, known in
Japanese mythology as Horai.
Quoting ethno-archaeologist Peter T Furst:
"that at the center of the Taoist Island of Paradise stood a giant immortal
pine, amid the most beautiful flowers, and animals that symbolized eternal
life; among these is a fungus of immortality, the legendary Ling Chih,
whose real ancestor may have been the fly-agaric [Amanita muscaria] of
Eurasiatic shamanism".
"the dwellers of this blessed island stayed eternally young by drinking from
the fountain of life at the foot of the enormous, never-decaying pine, which
reminds one of similar references cited by ethno-Mycologist R. Gordon
Wasson, in connection with Soma and the origins of the Tree of Life" (Peter
T. Furst, 1976 page 162).
The Hindu painting above encodes mushroom shaped lily pads beneath the Tree of Life, esoterically alluding to the mushroom of immortality.
Buddhism is named for its reputed founder Gautama also known as Siddharatha Gautama,
who came to be known as the Buddha, an Indian prince of the 6th century B.C. Buddhist
legend holds that during Gautama's lifetime he left footprints in all the lands where his
teachings would be acknowledged.



Footprint of the Buddha, bottom left 1st century, from the ancient kingdom of Gandhara,
in modern-day northern Pakistan and northeastern Afghanistan. The symbol with encoded
Fleur de lis is known as the "Three Jewels" or "Precious Triad" and encodes what I
propose are three Fleur de lis emblems as a symbol of a trinity or triad of creator gods. The
so-called "Wheel of Dharma" or "Wheel of Law" above the three proposed Fleur de lis
symbols, represents the symbol of Buddha and the path to Nirvana in Indian Buddhism.
Note the similarity of the "Wheel of Dharma" and the underneath image of the Amanita
muscaria mushroom cap. (sourse http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_footprint)
Hindu-Buddhist statues with the Fleur de lis symbol ?



Above is a limestone carving 1st century B.C.E. now in the British Museum in London,
titled the enlightenment of the Buddha. Note the footprints under the bodhi tree and
missing Buddha, who has finally reached Nurvana. Note what appears to be two encoded
Amanita muscaria mushrooms underneath the sacred bodhi-tree, that I would propose is an
esoteric symbol of the Buddha's divine resurrection. (from http://www.lessing

Above is the doorway to a 16th-century Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram
India called the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Note that the temple entrance is flanked by
dual serpents, and on each door there is a Fleur de lis symbol.
The Vedic-Hindu gods and goddesses of East Indian philosophy are in many ways very
similar to the pantheon of gods of Mesoamerica, for they too derived much of their
strength from the sacrifices of men. Vedic Hinduism and the religions of Mesoamerica
both believed in a three-tiered cosmos, with celestial gods traveling back and forth from
the heavens to the Underworld, and saw a triadic unity in their gods (Hindu triad, and
Palenque Triad) that was essentially related to cosmic forces such as wind, rain-lightening,
and fire, and the unity of creation, preservation, and destruction creating the cycle of life,
death, and rebirth. In Hindu mythology Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma, make up the Hindu
Trinity of gods.
The Churning of the Milk Ocean, is told in several ancient Hindu texts. At the suggestion
of Vishnu, the gods, and demons churn the primeval ocean in order to obtain Amrita,
which will guarantee them immortality (Kangra painting eighteenth century).



The avatar of the Vedic-Hindu god Vishnu is the sea turtle depicted below as the pivot for
Mt. Mantara acting as the churning stick.
(Above image is from worldviewtherapy.blogspot.com)
According to Vedic,Hindu, and Buddhist literature, the Gods got together at the beginning
of time and churned the ocean to extract a substance which would offer them immortality.
According to Richard J. Williams author of "Soma in Indian Religion" Etheogens as
Religious Sacrament (2009 p.2 Introduction), The Gods agreed to share this mighty elixir,
calling it Amrita, or Amrit which is a Sanskrit word for "nectar", a sacred drink also in
Buddhist mythology that grants their gods immortality.
In both Vedic (Hindu kalpas) and Mesoamerican cosmology (Popol Vuh) there was the
belief in cyclical creations, a multi-tiered heaven and underworld, deities who reside at the
four cardinal directions and its sacred center (see Madrid Codex below). Vishnu is the
preserver and protector of creation in the Hindu Trinity of Gods. Among the ancient Maya
the Turtle has been identified with rebirth, and the shell with divinity. In the creation
mythology of the ancient Maya the first created image was the turtle constellation Ac,
identified as the three stars (hearthstones of creation?) of the belt of Orion (Brennan,1998
p.93).
The carved Turtle God above is from the archaeological site of Topoxte,
located on an island on Lake Yaxha in the Peten Basin of northern



Guatemala. Note the carved hole at the center of the Turtle Gods shell,
that may have been the pivot hole for a churning stick.
Above is a ceramic image of a turtle depicting a face of a deity impersonating or
representing the avatar of a turtle. In Hindu mythology the god Vishnu assumes the avatar
of a sea turtle. Once again the hole at the center of the Turtle Gods shell, may have been
the pivot hole for a churning stick.
A similar creation story can be found in Lenape (later called the Delawares)
mythology in which a turtle once again acts as a central pivot point of the
Lenape universe. The Tree of Life acts as a cosmic pillar of creation.



The drawing above by Jenni Bongard is taken from the Late Postclassic Madrid Codex
page 71, which depicts the three hearth stones of creation, (Maya Trinity?) placed on the
back of the Cosmic turtle. The X-symbol depicted on each of the three stones likely
represents the glyph jal, a verb according to Michael Coe, to create ( see Coe's, Reading
the Maya Glyphs: 2001 p.163).
THE CHURNING OF THE MILK OCEAN, IN MESOAMERICA ?
The drawing above by Daniela Epstein-Koontz, is of a ball court relief panel from the
archaeological site of El Tajin, in Veracruz Mexico. Upon noticing the turtle in this
creation scene I knew right away that this ballcourt scene from El Tajin was a version of
the Hindu/Buddhist myth known as "The Churning of the Milk's Ocean", a creation story
often depicted in Hindu art. As it turns out I wasn't the first researcher to make the
connection. The late great archaeologist and epigrapher David H. Kelley, noted the
similarities years ago, but his work was often suppressed and criticized for his insistence to
carry on his studies of long range cultural contacts via trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic
voyages. Kelley noted the striking similarities between the Late Chow decorative styles of
China of 700-200 B.C.E. and those of the El Tajin culture of Veracruz, Mexico, of A.D.
500-1000 (Stephen C. Jett 1971, p.44) (Heine-Geldern, 1959a).
The art style at El Tajin is reminiscent of the Cotzumulhuapa culture on the Pacific coast of
Guatemala, and there is little doubt that there must have been close contact between the
two regions. Cotzumahlhuapa's imagery also depicts serpents, jaguars, human skulls and
skullracks, and bloody sacrifices performed by were-jaguars (see Lee A. Parsons 1963,
1965a, b, 1966 a,b, 1967).
Although Soma's actual identity has been lost through time, Soma was described as a god,
and as a "heavenly liquor" that was guarded by a Serpent. Note that in the drawing above
by Daniela Epstein-Koontz of the Tajin ballcourt panel, that a dual headed serpent lurks
below at the bottom of the scene, emerging from the ocean's depth. The turtle at the bottom
of the scene, may indeed represents the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu who acts as the
central pivot point, below the churning mechanism which is composed of an intertwined
serpent being pulled at both ends by sky deities (four cardinal directions) who create the
new born Sun (Vishnu ?). Note that the tail of the serpent end directly above the symbol of
the new born Sun just above the turtle in a three-lobed stylized design of the Fleur-de-lis
emblem, esoterically alluding I believe to the trinity of creator gods. The three arrows
penetrating the Sun in the scene alludes to the triad and the Sun's life giving rays of light.
If this ballcourt scene does represent Hindu mythology, and I feel certain that it does, than
the two deities behind the central characters hold containers or ritual buckets in their hands
filled with the Soma beverage.
For documentation of motif of ritual bucket (bag?) held by figures in hieratic scenes in
Mesoamerica see Drucker, Hiezer, & Squier, 1955: 198. For documentation of motif of
ritual bucket (bag?) held by figures in hieratic scenes in the Old World see H. Frankfort,
1955: pl.83.



The photograph above K4880, from the Justin Kerr Data Base, is of a turtle depicting an
incised Venus glyph. The turtle carved from shell, was excavated from a burial in the
Mundo Perdido of Tikal, Guatemala. In Maya creation myths the first manifestation of
creation is a Cosmic Turtle from which First Father is reborn. The turtle artifact above is in
the National Musuem of Guatemala. Museum no. 1875. length 4.5 cm. In Mesoamerican
mythology the planet Venus, (aka Quetzalcoatl) is clearly linked with the creation of the
universe, and an analysis of the Paris Codex (Milbrath, 1999; p.176) Zodiac pages 23-24,
suggests that the turtle is closely linked with the constellation of Orion (see cosmic turtle,
Bonampac murals room II) just like the turtle is in Hindu mythology. According to
Mesoamerican scholars Mary Miller and Karl Taube, (1993:175) there are a number of
Late Classic altars carved in the form of a turtle. One such turtle altar (Itzimte Altar 1),
depicts Maya Kaban curls. Maya scholar Linda Schele has deciphered that the Hero Twins
father, Hun Hunahpu, is reborn (as Sun God?) from the Underworld through the back of a
cosmic earth turtle. Resurrection myths in Mesoamerica are clearly linked to a cosmic
turtle, the ritual ballgame and the belt of Orion.
The Churning of the Milk Ocean myth depicted in a Mural from Tulum?
(drawing by Felipe Davalos G)
Above is a drawing of a Mural from the Maya site of Tulum, Structure 5, in Yucatan
Mexico, which depicts what I believe is a Post Classic Maya version of the Hindu myth,
The Churning of the Milk Ocean. Note the intertwined serpents in the main section of the
scene as well as a serpent swimming below in the primordial sea along with a fish and a
turtle in the lower section. The turtle bears the so-called head of a god scholars have
identified as God N. Once again the turtle acts as the central pivot point, below the
churning mechanism, which is composed of intertwined serpents. The characters above
likely depict the gods from the four cardinal directions representing both life and death,
upper world and underworld. The four deities use hand gestures to churn the Milk ocean,
and together with the serpent and turtle, (both are avatars of the planet Venus), create and
resurrect the reborn sun god. (drawing of Mural 1 from Tulum from Milbrath 1980).
THE CHURNING OF THE MILK OCEANIN THE MADRID CODEX



Above is page 19, from the Madrid Codex, also known as the Maya Tro-Cortesianus
Codex depicts what I believe are elements of the same Hindu inspired myth The Churning
of the Milk Ocean. Note that the deity above the turtle is painted blue, just like the Hindu
god Vishnu is in Hindu art, and that the turtle below once again acts as the pivot point for
the churning stick. The serpent's intertwined body is the mechanism by which the gods
churn the milk's ocean. In the scene above the artist depicts the importances and creative
forces of self sacrifice by substituting a rope for the serpents long body, depicting a blood
letting ritual in which the rope (the serpents body) is being pulled through the penises of
the gods above. The glyphs in the scene marked with the X-symbol, may represent the
Maya word jal, a verb meaning to create ( see Reading the Maya Glyphs: 2001 p.163).
The Vedic god who may have been the inspiration or prototype for the ancient Maya rain
god Chac, depicted in the scene above on the upper right with an elephant, or makara
inspired nose, was the Vedic rain god Indra, a warrior god who according to the Vedas
assumed many of the attributes of the god Soma.
The Churning of the Milk Ocean in the Codex Selden



Depicted above in the Codex Selden, is another scene that I feel represents a
Mesoamericanized version of the Hindu inspired creation myth known as The Churning of
the Milk Ocean. The complex scene on the page is first and foremost divided into three
sections, separating the upper world, from the underworld, and the middle world from
which the tree emerges. The upper world is depicted and framed at the corners of the page
with a sky band depicting disembodied eyes, which represent the soul of the deified
ancestral dead as the stars above. Framing in the bottom portion of the page is a two
headed feline/serpent, depicted with a stylized design of criss-crossing bands which can be
linked to a Maya verb jal, which means create, (Coe; p.163). The dual headed serpent
which frames the bottom of the page also surrounds a body of water that I believe
represents the so-called Milk ocean of Hindu mythology. Emerging from this sea of
creation (note waves) is a tree depicting a single eye, and intertwined serpents, emerging
from a sacred altar platform that depicts a band of stylized step glyphs, symbolizing the
descent and emergence from the underworld. Its worth noting that verses in the Rig Veda
refer to Soma as the "single eye", the eye of the sun, symbolism, that can be clearly seen
in the iconography above. Coiled around the trunk and branches of this sacred tree is a
two-headed serpent, which depicts feline fangs symbolizing the serpents descent into and
out from the underworld. The serpents feline attributes represent the underworld
transformation that takes place prior to the Sun God's resurrection from the underworld.
The central portion of the scene likely symbolize middle earth, from which the Tree of Life
emerges. The codex scene depicts two main characters or deities sitting on opposite sides
of the tree. I believe they symbolize both the God of Life and the God of death. The God
of Life and god of the upper world sits at the left of the tree. He appears to have emerged
from the mouth of the serpent below him at left. Opposite the God of Life, on the other
side of the tree is the God of Death, who has emerged from the mouth of the serpent with
the feline head.
Both deities hold in their hands a ritual sacrament, to be eaten or offered as a gift to the
Tree of Life, from which the Sun God is reborn and immortality is obtained.
At the top of the page we see the newly born Sun God emerge from a V-shaped cleft
depicted in the upper branches of the Tree of Life. To the right of the Sun God in the upper
right hand corner of the page is an icon that is shaped like a drinking vessel that bears a
symbol of five points beneath the vessel that refers to the so-called "fiveness" of Venus,
referring to the planets five sonodic cycles, noted by scholars in the Dresden Codex. I
believe that this symbol is linked to the Soma ritual and the sacred day Ahau, in the Venus
calendar, when Venus is first visible rising from the Underworld as the Morning Star. I
would argue that this Venus resurrection ritual is intimately connected with the Soma
beverage and Soma sacrifices mentioned in the Rig Veda. The symbol to the left of the Sun
God, and opposite the probable Soma vessel located at the left hand corner of the page is
the year sign in the Aztec calendar.
Moving on to the middle portion of the scene, I believe the sequence of events, reads from
right to left, and is as follows. Just to the right of the altar platform from which the Tree of
Life emerges, there is a bleeding turtle just above a body of water I believe refers to the
"Milk Ocean" in Hindu mythology. The bleeding turtle is located just below the deity
identified as the God of Death and the Underworld. The bleeding turtle in this scene
represents the sacrificial victim, whose shell or carapace in this scene will be the sacred
portal linked to immortality and divine resurrection. The turtle's bloody heart can be seen
sitting on top of the altar platform just to the left of the tree, as a sacrificial gift to the Gods
of Life and Death who are responsible at times completion for the death and daily rebirth
and resurrection of the Sun God. Note that the three turtle carapaces depicted in the
primordial sea moving from right to left, under the Tree of Life, is a reference to the three
hearthstones of creation, and that the turtle carapace located on the far left just below
Tlaloc's severed head appears to have a star symbol inside the shell, which likely alludes to
the planet Venus and that the turtle represents Venus as a divine resurrection star.
Just below the Tree of Life, underneath the altar platform is the carapace of the turtle with
the head of a feline emerging, symbolizing the turtle's transformation in the underworld
into the Underworld Jaguar. The sequence of events moves to the left, and then up, with
the empty turtle carapace still in the sea, but just above and to the left of the altar platform
is a stylized severed head, associated with the ritual act of decapitation. The stylized



severed head bears the image of the Mexican Rain and Lightening God Tlaloc, who also
represents the God of the Underworld and thus he represents the god of underworld
decapitation, as the Evening Star aspect of the planet Venus. Tlaloc's severed head in this
scene is stylized to represent a divine star reborn from the Underworld. Tlaloc can be
easily identified in this scene by his trademark goggled eyes, feline fangs, and handlebar
mustache. Those who died for Tlaloc or were under his watchful eye, went directly to his
divine paradise called Tlalocan.
The hallucinogenic mushroom cult, which has survived to this day among certain tribes
like the Zapotec, Chinantec, and Mazatec Indians of Mexico, there is little to no
information regarding the use of sacred mushrooms, among the present day Maya, having
most likely concealed their ritual use from outsiders.
As I have discovered, its quite possible that the Amanita muscaria mushroom cult may still
survive in remote areas of Highland Guatemala, where the Amanita muscaria mushroom
grows in abundance.
In 2009, I was surprised to find that the Maya Indians of the Guatemala Highlands were
selling these tiny Amanita muscaria mushroom toys in the markets like the one depicted
above. Although the seller informed me that the Maya did eat this variety of mushroom, it
is possible she may have been referring to the non-hallucinogenic Amanita caesarea,
commonly sold in markets in Mexico and Guatemala and much appreciated for its delicate



flavor (Guzmán, 2002:3) I bought several of these toy Amanita muscaria mushrooms as
gifts. They all have a quetzal bird sitting in a tree painted on the stem. Although clearly a
child's toy produced for the tourist trade, they bear symbolism of great antiquity. In
Mesoamerican mythology the World tree, with its roots in the underworld and its branches
in the heavens, represents the axis mundi or center of the world. The branches represent
the four cardinal directions. Each of the directions was associated with a different color
while the color green represented the central place. A bird, known as the celestial bird or
Principal Bird Deity, usually sits atop the tree. The trunk, which connects the two planes,
was seen as a portal to the underworld. The Quetzal bird, now the national bird of modern
Guatemala, was considered sacred because of its green plumage. I believe there is now
clear evidence that the Amanita muscaria mushroom is a symbol of equal antiquity. (Photographs by Connor de Borhegyi)
"Soma in the Americas", is a study dedicated to the pioneering efforts of Robert
Gordon Wasson, and my father Dr. Stephan F. de Borhegyi. From the time of their initial
meeting in Guatemala in 1953 until Borhegyi's untimely death in 1969, the two scientists
worked in close cooperation and shared a voluminous correspondence of over 500 letters.
As the result of their collaborative efforts, as well as Wasson's extensive research into
mushroom symbolism in Siberia and Southeast Asia, they surmised that if the mushroom
stones did, indeed, represent a mushroom cult, then the mushroom itself was an
iconographic metaphor, and the mushroom stone effigies would supply the clues necessary
to decipher their meaning.

Stephan F. de Borhegyi, based his theory of a mushroom cult among the ancient Maya on
his identification of a mushroom stone cult that came into existence in the Guatemala
Highlands and Pacific coastal area around 1000 B.C. along with a trophy head cult
associated with human sacrifice and the Mesoamerican ballgame. He supported this theory



with a solid body of archaeological and historical evidence.
The Wassons, published Borhegyi’s article on the subject in their monumental book,
