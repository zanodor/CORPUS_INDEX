Decipherment of Sumerian cylinder seal VA-243
Stuart Harris, July 2018, Knoxville TN
Introduction
Imagine, if you will, the fear that gripped Earth in 9400 BC. Everyone had witnessed monstrous Storm utterly destroy Mother, a planet three times the size of Earth, by flinging one of his many moons directly into her bowels. The resulting explosion spewed pieces of Mother across the universe, incinerated Earth nightly with meteorites, blocked light from the Sun. Nothing remained of the great goddess, and now Storm was circling back, coming from the direction of Aries, surrounded by his spearmen. He demanded every man, woman and child, and especially Champion, the Hand of Mother.
Earth had just acquired a new Moon, a brave champion, the only survivor of seven sons of Mother. Storm had captured Moon when he speared Mother, then accidentally lost Moon to Earth as he sped by. Now he wanted Moon back. People prayed to their new champion to save them, hide Earth from Storm and his deadly spearmen.
The narrator survived the first rain of firestones, and now fears the worst. The scribe compressed this long tale into a tiny cylinder seal through the ingenious use of rebuses. Twenty-three notches on the horns of Aries may represent the number of days in a month.

Summary of Tableau
The tableau shows Saa ‘Storm’ (Nibiru) leading Kuu ‘Moon’ (Nanna) by the hand to Maa ‘Earth’. Moon’s epithet Nanna means ‘Like a bull’, yet of the three figures, only Moon lacks horns, perhaps a new bull. From Äiti ‘Mother’ (Tiamat), Storm brings the only survivor from the destruction of Mother by his spearmen. Nanna, the Hand of Mother, will become Earth’s champion against their common adversary Storm. Depicted above Storm’s shoulder is the Star of Earth, enveloped by debris from the destruction of Mother that blocks the Sun’s rays from reaching Earth. The throne, symbolic of Aset-Nibiru-Isis, occurs on the Egyptian calendar in Senenmut’s Tomb just after 9437 BC, when Aset ascended to prominence among the gods by fatally crippling Mut (Mother). A plow, symbolic of fertility, represents Äiti ‘Mother’, the planet destroyed by Nibiru. On his shoulder, Kuu-Moon carries a statue of an athlete throwing a spear. A ram, Aries, overlooks a forest of broken trees, symbolizing the direction from which Nibiru came.

History of Interpretation
William Hayes Ward’s drawing of Sumerian cylinder seal VA-243, in the Near Eastern Museum of Berlin, emphasizes the construction details of the plow. He wondered about the large number of planets surrounding the sun (Ward, 1910).
Anton Moortgat deciphered three cuneiform text boxes, which made no sense in Akkadian, but reads ‘I bring a pig from beyond the highland of man clan’ in Finnish (Moortgat, 1940).



Introduction
Page 3
Zechariah Sitchin focused on the image of the sun surrounded by eleven planets, which related to how planet Nibiru destroyed Tiamat and terrorized Earth (Sitchin, 1976, The 12th Planet).
Emilio Spedicato recalculated Nibiru’s period as 20 years. He estimated the date when Nibiru lost Moon to Earth as 9450 BC (Spedicato, 2012).
Stuart Harris reversed the image in order to read its script, called Old European, widely used throughout Europe before cuneiform, and amenable to constructing rebuses. The seal details the destruction of Tiamat by Nibiru and the transfer of Moon to Earth soon after 9437 BC.
William Hayes Ward’s drawing
William Hayes Ward’s drawing of VA243 in 1910 recognized the image of a plow and a sacrificial goat. There is both a six-pointed star and an eight-pointed star.
Figure 2: Drawing and explanation of cylinder seal VA243 by Ward, 1910.
Anton Moortgat decipherment
Anton Moortgat (1940), a renowned Akkadian scholar, read the three text boxes as Dubsiga Iliillat, ir-su. These he translated as ‘Dubsiga, Ili-illat, your servant’. In Finnish, which is the language of the seal, TUPI SIKA ILI ILI-LAT IR SU reads Tuopin sikan ylin yli-lat yrön su’u meaning ‘I bring a pig from beyond the highlands of man clan’. There is no pig, so these texts must mean something else.
Zachariah Sitchin’s Nibiru
Zachariah Sitchin (1976) published the decipherment of a host of newly found Sumerian tablets that described titanic battles long ago between fiery planet Nibiru against two adversaries, Tiamat and Earth. Earth barely survived, but Tiamat perished. His descriptions remain fantastic, on a par with the cylinder seal.
At the same time, he interpreted the texts to mean Earth had been invaded by giants riding a moon of Nibiru, kept alive by the heat of Nibiru, a semi-star. There is no need to invoke Nibiru giants were already on Earth, erecting grand structures that defy common logic, such as an immense pyramid in Bosnia faced with cement around 35,000 years ago. Herds of mastodons could supply their larder.



Emilio Spedicato’s hypotheses
Page 4
Emilio Spedicato’s hypotheses
Sitchin interpreted the period of Nibiru as 3600 years, not realizing that Sumerian astronomical numbers were meant to be divided by 180 (Spedicato, 2012). The correct period then becomes 20 years, confirmed by periodic cooling every twenty years in GRIP2 ice core of Greenland, and further confirmed by an Egyptian calendar that measures time in twenty-year intervals with a five-pointed star, their symbol for Aset-Nibiru, the fifth body from the Sun. Given a twenty-year period and sixty-year conjunction, many natural catastrophes trace their origin to Nibiru, such as the sinking of Atlantis and the end of the Younger Dryas (Harris, 2018, forthcoming).
This cylinder seal spectacularly confirms a number of ideas from Emilio Spedicato.
Nibiru was the fifth body from the Sun with a fixed, elliptical orbit of 20 years in the same plane as that of Jupiter, Tiamat and Earth.
Nibiru, Jupiter, Tiamat and Earth were in synchronous orbits of 20, 12, 4 and 1 years due to the gravity of Jupiter.
At each pass, Nibiru would nearly hit the other three, always passing on the Sun side, a stable configuration.
Nibiru transferred Moon from Tiamat to Earth around 9450 BC; thus, Moon was the only survivor of the complete destruction of Tiamat.
The destruction of Tiamat by Nibiru wreaked havoc on Earth by incinerating one face. In the text, the scribe is the only survivor, man or cow, from a hail of burning stones. Drawn on the cylinder seal, debris surrounds the Sun and blocks light from reaching Earth.
Earth already had a satellite, so Moon became the greater satellite, and a great boon to man by illuminating the night sky.
This earlier satellite was Mars, which illuminated Earth with about a tenth of the light of Moon and had a period of 1/3 year, also synchronous with Jupiter. Thus, Mars had a solar climate identical to that of Earth, rotated in the same axial direction as Earth, and may have had an atmosphere that conserved water.
Planets Mercury, Venus and Mars did not yet exist.
Orbits of planets
The orbital periods for the four inner planets were Earth 1 year, Tiamat 4 years, Jupiter 12 years, and Nibiru 20 years. Nibiru approached Earth every 20 years and came very close every 60 years at the equinox, when Earth, Tiamat and Jupiter were in conjunction. Nibiru intersected Tiamat every 20 years, a year after passing Earth.

Language of cylinder seal
Finnish was the language of Old European, documented by Harris over the last several years with numerous translations from around the world. Old European is a Consonant-Vowel syllabary, whose initial values were obtained from a hundred bilingual texts called Owners Marks.
The rules for reading and writing remained constant for thousands of years: ignore final consonant of a syllable; ignore internal D, H, J, T, V; compress double letters into a single letter; compress diphthongs into the first vowel. These rules allow thousands of words to be written with a single syllable. In nearly all instances, the text reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom, as do compound letters made up of several syllables.
To save space, scribes selected words that could be written with just one syllable, so that most written words have only one syllable. Each letter was extremely simple, which allowed multiple letters to be combined into a single image, further reducing space. With few exceptions, only limited rotation was allowed before a letter would change into another.
Numbers in a list generally go to the right of the noun. There is no punctuation, but in this cylinder seal, the scribe collected entire phrases into a single compound letter, which greatly improved clarity.
Reversal of image
Two letters of Old European which cannot be reversed indicate which way to read the text.
Until 700 BC, text read only from left to right or from top to bottom, which means that the entire image must be reversed. For the scribe, this would have made carving easier. Figure 4 shows the reversed image partitioned into self-contained areas. The sequence is not linear because what originally seemed impossible to be text did become text as I discovered a true master at work.
Decipherment depends heavily on reading rebuses. My table of letters covers many geographic areas, and nearly every letter has multiple instances of usage, but no other text displays such an astonishing variety. Perhaps the scribe intended to use every variation in the writer’s toolbox.

Syllabary of cylinder seal
The scribe of VA-243 created this cylinder seal to permanently record the origin of Moon and the destruction of Tiamat by Nibiru. It showcases different techniques for combining letters into a rebus to augment a story. Words are written with an astonishing variety of symbols. For example, the outer text around the Sun contains only dots, anticipating Scandinavian dot writing, while letters on the ram horns and skirts feature slanted lines, anticipating Ogham. The scribe was also a master sculptor, exemplified by the figure carried by Moon of an athlete launching a spear, which anticipates Greek sculpture by three millennia.

10: Statue carried by Moon He now will be the great new champion. Many miserable men will pronounce ‘Peace on Earth’.
11: Mää - Earth Son of Earth’s spearmen ended the brawl. Broken into scrap she became. A fellow of Mother survived, from a great family of seven wizards, a manly champion, Mother’s Hand, to bewail Storm’s fury. Nanna (bull-like) arrived, adversary of Storm, to pronounce peace, to poison painful anguish.
12: Sää-Storm-Nibiru So, I proceeded to tear away scraps from Mother. Into her eye I blew a plume; through her skin it poured, into her womb. The new Hand, the fellow from Mother, I will smite. Having vanquished Mother of Seven, I will stop by Earth to spear the Hand. Spearmen will go to claim the champion, to demand the miserable man I drove away.
13: Kuu-Moon-Nanna Brave Champion, deprived of family on Earth; Great Champion’s mother, toppled by boulders. I have to conceal the Noble One from a plume to prevent a disaster. Seven lands were broken into filaments by Storm. Thunder from the east through the night resounded, Valiant Champion; painful anguish raged through most of the night against the Seven, against Mother.
14: Aries the Ram Bull champion, remnant of the seven, father of heaven and earth, head of men, star of the greatest peace, first sky noble: He demands new mothers and men; he demands any offspring of men; he wants the families remaining. He will finish Earth now, as well as fetch the new champion and poison others. He evicted Mother; he evicted by sword settlement of Earth with great hostility.
15: Skirt of Earth All the men in carts were smashed; now two men watch for Storm. It crushed the cattle as well, who were mangled into a pile of snot. Seven sons of the great wizard were smashed by the heavens. Cart makers mostly carry old men toward the water; yesterday, transporting was halted.
16: Skirt of Storm Sheep evaporated completely; likewise, carts, wizards and old men. Men still are invigorated, still slaving away.
17: Skirt of Moon It disperses the men: chunks, fire sparks and hailstones from the remains of Mother. Hail against the earth desires to kill. High men advise: dusk will bring hailstones.

A relief of moon god Nanna runs to the right, left hand upraised to throw a spear. Its modeling and contrapposto are astounding, not to be equaled until Greek sculpture of the fifth century. Likewise, the depiction of the ram Aries is marvelous. Consider the famous head of Inanna of Sumer from the same period, an arresting portrait. It is no accident that the most expensive sculpture ever sold at the time was a figurine of a lion from Sumer, the Guennol Lioness.

Text 12, Sää-Storm-Nibiru
Storm, the planet Nibiru, describes how he chipped off pieces of Äiti ‘the Mother’ on the first pass. On the second pass, he eviscerated her by blowing a plume into her eye, down to her womb. (A plume was a moon, which Sitchin translated as ‘a wind’.) Next, he will spear the new Hand of Earth, whom he just finished transporting to Earth from the Mother of Seven after the first pass. His spearmen will strike the new moon, claim the champion.

Text 13, Kuu-Moon-Nanna
With a single encounter, Storm destroyed Mother and her seven companions, shredded them into filaments. Somewhat later, thunder resounded through the night from the east as debris struck half of Earth. Now brave champion Moon has to hide noble Earth from Storm to prevent a similar disaster.

Text 14, Aries the Ram
Aries the Ram announces the approach of raging Storm (Nibiru). He blows two horns that contain six titles including Remnant of the Seven, and Father of Heaven and Earth. Storm demands all men, women and children. He has already laid waste to Mother (Tiamat) and many settlements of Earth with his spears (meteorites). Storm plans to kill the remaining people and fetch back Moon.

4.1 The use of entirely slant letters on the two horns of Aries anticipates Ogham, which uses only slant lines. It resembles a method of counting with notched sticks. 4.1 On both horns, 23 prongs may represent the number of days in a month or moon, the person to whom the text addresses. Spedicato estimated 21 days.

Text 15, Skirt of Earth
All the men in carts going to the water were smashed, as were cattle, mangled into a pile of snot. Seven sons of the great shaman were crushed by the strike from heaven. Now two men watch for Storm. Yesterday, transportation to the water stopped.

Notes
15 This astounding section is written almost entirely with slanted letters. The skirt and shoes looked so natural that I had no idea it was writing. Only close examination showed subtle differences between strokes. 15.3 To compose a sentence with three TA’s in a row is amazing.

Sheep evaporated completely, as did carts, wizards and old men. Still, men slave away with energy.

Notes
The narrator / scribe seems to view men as a different group, ones that slave away; perhaps the narrator is a woman, trained to read, write and observe. 16.3.2 and 16.3.4. This unique letter does not appear in other decipherments, a vertical letter. From just this seal, it can’t be I, U, RA, NI, PE, VI, KA or KÄ, which leaves only Y.

English translation
16.1 Sheep evaporated 16.2 completely; likewise, carts, wizards and old men. 16.3 Men still are invigorated, still slaving away.
Text 17, Skirt of Moon
Bombardment from remnants of the destruction of Mother (Tiamat) continue. People disperse to survive. A council of wise men advises that hail will start again at dusk.
During the day, Earth acted as a shield from the expanding sphere of debris, but not at night. This observation may date the subterranean settlements and tunnels on Earth to this period. Half the day they could move about, half they hid underground. Hopi history says they moved in with ant men who lived underground, someplace like Cappadocia in Turkey or the Egyptian tunnels in the Grand Canyon, or the tunnels radiating from Lima. As Earth continued around its orbit, the bombardment would shift to daytime.

Page 101 has a photograph of the seal impression, plus the phonetics and a translation of three text boxes: Dubsiga Ili-illat, ir-su, which he translated as ‘Dubsiga, Iliillat, your servant’. In Finnish, which is the language of the seal, TUPI SIKA ILI ILI-LAT IR SU reads Tuopin sikan ylin yli-lat yrön su’u meaning ‘I bring a pig from beyond the highlands of man clan’.
Sitchin, Zecharia (1976); The 12th Planet; Stein and Day. Includes a detailed photograph of VA243. He analyzes the sun symbol, which he relates to planet Nibiru, the 12th planet, arrived at by counting planets around the sun symbol. The internet is filled with additional interpretations of this symbol. He translated the period of Nibiru as 3600 years, an unfortunate error that has led any number of people to look for a return of Planet X; he should have divided by 180 as required with Sumerian astrological numbers. He created a history of Biblical giants who arrived with Nibiru, described as flaming, sun-like, impossible to live on, but possibly riding on one of its many moons. This history of arriving giants is conflated with the transfer by Nibiru of Tiamat’s Moon to Earth.
