# Index for Jerald Jack Starr – Mesopotamian prostitutes - SumerianShakespeare-com.pdf

According to the British Museum, this statuette was made in "Phoenicia? Cyprus?". It was found in Tharros (Sardinia). It shows the wide extent of Babylonian influence on the portrayal of prostitutes. In Babylonian art, if a woman is cupping her breasts it means she is a prostitute.

Munus-kin, a Sumerian prostitute
7-9 minutes
A clay plaque shows a man and a woman (a prostitute) having sex. The
woman sips beer through a long straw. This was a popular motif
throughout Mesopotamia. There are many different variations on this
theme. The plaques were made in molds for mass production.
It was the Mesopotamian version of pornography.

Munus-kin = woman-work =
prostitute
Yes, munus (woman) is exactly what it looks like, turned on its side.
The signs for man and woman were originally pictographs of their
genitals, which probably saved a lot of gender confusion.
The man is uncircumcised, by the way.

When I was trying to translate Tablet BE 31,28, the story of The Princess

look up the Sumerian word for “prostitute”. I was surprised when I

(the electronic Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary). All the references to
prostitutes (kar-kid)
were listed in the Old Babylonian period, after the end of Sumerian
civilization. I thought,
"Really?" How could the Sumerians not have a word for prostitute? After
all, it is the
"world's oldest profession".
I had assumed munus-kin was the Sumerian word for "prostitute" because
of this sentence:
Enlarge.
r6 lu2-zuh!- ir- ra nu-nus munus-kin du3 [...]
man-rob-plunder-for woman prostitute all
This is line r6 of Tablet BE 31,28, the story of The Princess Wife. It
translates as "All women
are prostitutes (munus-kin) for men who rob and plunder." Within the
context of the story,
it means that all women willingly prostitute themselves to rich and
powerful men
(within and without marriage) in exchange for money.
I was convinced that munus-kin was the Sumerian word for prostitute.
The problem is,
Tablet BE31,28 is dated in the Old Babylonian period. I wondered if there
was an earlier Sumerian citation for the word that hadn’t yet been
discovered, so I kept looking.

One of these women is a prostitute and the other is not. Can you tell which
is which?
The answer is given on the page about Babylonian Prostitutes.
Getting back to the subject at hand...
Munus-kin: “woman-to work”. Like I said, I think this is the Sumerian
word for “prostitute”.
This definition doesn't appear in the ePSD, the ETCSL, or the Sumerian
Lexicon. The only occurrence of the signs on the CDLI is an inscription on
a statue of Gudea (P431884,
lines 54 – 58). These lines describe the people that Gudea exiled from the
city during the
re-dedication of the holy temple of Ningirsu:
The sexually impure persons who inspire fear,
the [...] man, {lu2 si gi4-a, the man who “deflowers” women?}
he with a shriveled(?) penis,
and the woman who had been in labor(?), {munus-kin}
he sent out of the city.
The question mark after “the woman who had been in labor(?)” shows that
the translator
had serious doubts about this interpretation of munus-kin. Rightfully so,

because if Gudea banished all the women who had once been in labor,
then most women would end up
outside the city walls. Plus, Gudea would not banish (and disgrace) all the
mothers who had given birth to the citizens of his kingdom.
Notice how the other people mentioned on the list can be described as
“sexual deviants”.
That means munus-kin also has a sexual connotation. So perhaps woman
work is like
“working girl” in English, a euphemism for a prostitute. KIN also means to
love or to seek.
A “woman to love” and a “woman to seek” both suggest a prostitute. Now
it makes sense
that Gudea banished the prostitutes from the city during the dedication of
a new temple.
He didn't want them plying their trade during this solemn and dignified
occasion.
This kind of hanky-panky would be quite unseemly during the dedication
of a holy temple.
I suggest that munus-kin was the polite euphemism for a prostitute, which
is why it is used
on a royal monument like the Gudea statue.
Munus-kin appears in line r10 of The Great Fatted Jackass where it also
means a prostitute:

r10 lu2 zuh! [ir#] ra munus munus-kin [du3 ...]
man-rob-plunder-for woman prostitute all
This line has the same translation as r6 in the story of The Princess Wife,
"All women are prostitutes for men who rob and plunder." In each story,
this is the only translation of
munus-kin that makes any sense, and it fits perfectly within the context of
both stories.
It also fits perfectly within the Gudea translation. That's a total of three
different citations.
I therefore suggest that munus-kin means "prostitute". It shows that the
Sumerians had a specific word for prostitute.
Actually, they had two.
Kar-kid

The day after I posted this page, a colleague informed me that kar-kid is
often used to mean prostitute. I pointed out that all citations on the ePSD
are dated in the Babylonian period,
after the end of the Sumerian period. He replied, “Not all citations show
up on the ePSD.”
That got me thinking about kar-kid.
I started looking for kar-kid on the CDLI. I found three tablets (CDLI #(s)
010764, 011028,
and 011031) from the Early Dynastic IIIa period of Sumerian history
(2600 - 2500 BC).
They are accounting tablets that record the distribution of rations (wages)
for various workers. They specifically mention “geme2-kar-kid”.
Geme2 (munus-kur) means “a female worker, servant, or slave”. It
designates a profession,
a job title. This leaves no doubt that a kar-kid was indeed a professional
prostitute,
someone who did it for a living.
After I read the transliteration, I looked at a picture of the tablet to see
how the signs were written. When I saw the signs, I said, “Whoa!”
I was expecting to see the signs that are shown above.
What I saw was this:

I wondered if I was looking at the same signs.
Notice that the original version of geme2 is very different than the later
standardized version.
In the archaic form of geme2, the kur sign is written within the interior of
the munus sign, and the horizontal line is moved to the exterior.
The horizontal line would be blotted out by the kur sign, so the line moved
to the outside
to preserve it. This shows it was originally part of the munus sign, thus
maintaining the meaning of the sign. It also shows that the line is
accounted for, and it wasn’t omitted
out of carelessness simply because the scribe forgot to write it (like
forgetting to cross a “T”).
It is difficult to write geme2 this way on a small scale, so after the ED III
period, kur was written beside munus rather than within it.
The other noticeable difference between the two versions of kar-kid is that
the original Sumerian version is written with the sign ak rather than kid.
Ironically, an alternative pronunciation of ak is kid3 (I know it’s
confusing, but that’s just
the way Sumerian is). I have no idea why none of the Sumerian citations
for prostitutes
(kar-kid3 and/or kar-ak) show up on the ePSD.
I personally think that original Sumerian version of prostitute (kar-kid3)

should be denoted as kar-ak, to distinguish it from the later versions, but
that’s just my opinion.
In any case, Sumerian prostitutes have been there all along.
Igi-gun5, a female name.
Munus-kin, kar-ak. This means there has always been two Sumerian
words for prostitute. They've been around for more than 4,000 years.
Which isn’t very surprising when you come to think about it.
After all, it's the world's oldest profession, in the world's oldest
civilization.

Sumerian "known prostitutes"
At first glance, these tablets seem unimportant. They are Sumerian
“administration tablets”
that were used for accounting purposes. As such, the tablets are similar to
thousands
of other Sumerian tablets (a cuneiform tablet is not as rare as most people
think).
Generally, administration tablets are deadly dull to read. It’s like reading
account ledgers.
But these three tablets hold a few surprises.
The tablets record the distribution of rations (wages) to various workers.
Among other commodities, most of the workers receive a standard issue
ration of grain. The grain is measured in 2 large barig units and 4 smaller
ban2 units.
It's a very eclectic group of workers, including one (or more) of the
following occupations: administrator, barber, carpenter, cook (and head
cook), cup-bearer, doctor, farmer, felter,
herald, lamentation singer, land recorder, leather worker, maltster,
merchant, midwife,
musician, official (and high official), priestess, scribe, secretary, household
steward,
stone cutter, servant/slave, and weaver.
There are eight workers who are listed as šubur (see Footnote 1 on a
separate page)
meaning either a servant or a slave.
2 barig and 4 ban (grain units for the) servant/slave
These tablets are important because they have the world’s first written
reference to
prostitutes (seven of them, in fact). Not only is this the first time in known
history that
the word “prostitute” is written, but the tablets actually refer to the

prostitutes by name.
Their names are written down and their profession is listed as “prostitute”.
To use the
modern vernacular, each woman is a “known prostitute”. Now we know
the names of the first professional prostitutes in recorded history.
The name of one prostitute is heavily damaged and cannot be read. This
leaves a total of
six women.
In alphabetic order, the women are: An-ama-gu, An-mu-da, Igi-gun, Nin
gu-gal, Nin-men, and Nin-ni-gi. (2)
The Sumerian word for prostitute is kar-kid3. A professional prostitute is
designated as
geme2-kar-kid3.
Geme2 means “a female worker, servant, or slave”. It denotes a
professional status.
A known Sumerian prostitute:
An-mu-da

The upper corner of this tablet shows the record for An-mu-da receiving
her rations of grain.
Notice that the scribe wrote the signs out of order. He wrote kid3-kar
instead of kar-kid3.
A scribe didn’t always bother to keep the signs in the proper sequence. He
often wrote them
to best fit within the space provided, without worrying too much about the
niceties of
correct spelling. He just threw the signs in a box and expected the reader
to sort them out.
This was a common practice in early Sumerian writing. It’s one of the
many reasons why
the language is so incredibly difficult to translate.
Fortunately, after the ED III period, the Sumerian scribes became more
conscientious about keeping the signs in the correct order.
Five more Sumerian prostitutes:
We have already met An-mu-da. Here are the names of the other five
prostitutes that are
listed on the tablets:

Nin-gu2-gal
On the front of the tablet, Nin-gu-gal receives a standard grain ration of
2barig 4ban units.
On the reverse side, she receives an identical grain ration (!). Did she get
back in line?
Is she “double dipping”? In both instances she is clearly identified as a
prostitute, so it’s
not like she’s fooling anyone. Perhaps there's a mundane explanation for
the extra rations
(back wages?) but there seems to be something else going on here. Did the
scribe who
recorded the transactions let her get extra food? Or did his supervisor let
her do it?
Is the food a gift, or was something expected in return? (3)
Nin-me-en
Two adjacent vowels are pronounced as one, so me-en is pronounced as
“men”.
There’s something very surprising about Nin-men, as we shall soon
discover.
The record of Nin-men’s grain ration occurs sequentially right after the
record for An-mu-da. That means Nin-men and An-mu-da were standing
in line right next to each other while they
waited for their rations.
Nin-ni-gi (4) also written as "Ninigi".

geme2-kar-kid3
2 barig 4 ban (grain units for) Nin-ni-gi
prostitute
This is how the signs look on the tablet. Notice that the signs are written
out of order,
in both her name (Nin-gi-ni) and her profession (kar-kid3-geme2).
The first known prostitute in world history:
All of the women listed above are "known prostitutes", but is it possible to
pick just one
as the absolute first prostitute known to history?
This "honor" belongs to the first woman listed on the tablet that was
written the earliest. Unfortunately, none of the tablets have a date. We
know they belong within the 100 years
of the ED IIIa period, but that's a very wide range.
Fortunately, we do know that all three tablets are contemporary to each
other. They were written within a span of a few years, or most probably
within the same year.
That's because there are many names in common on the three tablets. I
did a quick count
and came up with a partial list of 18 names that match on any two or all
Sumerian "known prostitutes" about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/999701/992901.html
8 of 18 8/18/2020, 4:46 PM



three of the tablets including five ugulas (overseers).
Even so, the fact that the tablets are not dated means we cannot pick out
the world's first prostitute in recorded history. The name of the prostitute
on one tablet is damaged and
cannot be read, so we will have to settle for a two-way tie, with the names
written first on the other two tablets.
They are: An-mu-da and Nin-ni-gi. These are the first prostitutes known
to history,
However, the fact that the tablets are closely contemporary to each other
tells us something very interesting about the seven women: They lived in
the same city, they were in the same profession, and they received rations
from the same facility (either a temple or a government warehouse). This
means all the prostitutes no doubt knew each other. They may have been
friends, perhaps rivals, and some of them probably worked together.
One tablet tell us that An-mu-da and Nin-men were standing in line right
next to each other
Sumerian "known prostitutes" about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/999701/992901.html

while waiting for their gran rations. On another tablet, Nin-ni-gi, Nin-gu
gal, Igi-gun, and
An-ama-gu were all standing in the same line. On a third tablet, An-ama
gu shows up again with two other prostitutes (5).
I believe they all knew each other. As the outcasts of society, prostitutes
are their own
little community. Through their shared experiences (and hardships) they
tend to bond
most closely with each other.
Remember when I said there is something surprising about Nin-men?

The pound sign “#” means that a Sumerian sign is damaged but still
readable. The
exclamation point “!” usually indicates a scribal error, like an incorrect
word or a
miswritten sign.
Occasionally, the exclamation point indicates surprise on the part of the
translator. This is certainly the case here. It’s like he’s saying, “Damn!
Look at that!”
This is because dam is actually the Sumerian word for “spouse”. It means
that Nin-men,
the prostitute, is married! This is shocking enough to begin with, but
there’s more.
The husband is listed as šim-mu2 (pronounced as “Shimu”). It’s not quite
clear if that is
his name or his profession (6). Šim-mu2 is defined as a “perfumer”, so
perhaps Nin-men
married a man who made perfume. Šim-mu2 also occurs in later
Babylonian texts as a
translation of the Akkadian word ašīpu, meaning “an incantation priest,
sorcerer, magician,
or dream interpreter” (all Sumerian signs have multiple meanings).
Now there’s an interesting couple, a prostitute married to a
sorcerer/magician.

11 of 18 8/18/2020, 4:46 PM



However, we must not over romanticize this union. As we will see, Shimu
is no magic man.
I’m inclined to believe that Shimu is the man’s name, not his profession.
Besides that,
I don’t think Shimu was anything glamorous like a sorcerer or a magician,
or even a
perfumer or an incantation priest. It speaks volumes about Shimu’s
character that his wife
is still a prostitute even after their marriage. He kept his wife in
prostitution and he thus
benefited from the money she made by selling her body to strangers. What
kind of man
would do such a thing? This tells us everything we need to know about
Shimu’s character.
Usually, when a prostitute gets married, she becomes an ex-prostitute. For
her, that’s the whole point of the operation. So why is Nin-men still a
prostitute?
And what happened to the money she made by prostituting herself?
Legally, the husband has control over the finances, so Shimu directly
benefited from his
wife’s prostitution.
I suggest that so far as husbands go, Shimu is the lowest of the low.

2 barig units for A-lal3
wife of Šim-mu2
2 barig units for An-ama#-gu10
This tablet tells us that Shimu is also married to a woman named A-lal (!)
And standing
right beside her is An-ama-gu (!!) Their rations were recorded
consecutively. Remember,
An-ama-gu is a known prostitute. This strongly suggests that A-lal is also
a prostitute (!!!).
An-ama-gu
Wow. I bet you didn't see that one coming.
On this tablet, A-lal isn't officially labeled as a prostitute, but this
particular tablet doesn't usually list a person's profession (An-ama-gu isn't
labeled as a prostitute either).
However, A-lal is in the company of a known prostitute and she is wedded
Sumerian "known prostitutes" about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/999701/992901.html
13 of 18 8/18/2020, 4:46 PM



to a man
who married another prostitute. I therefore suggest that if A-lal isn’t
already a prostitute,
she soon will be.
We don’t know for certain which woman Shimu married first. Was it Nin
men or A-lal?
Had one of them died, or been divorced?
It’s also possible that Shimu was married to both women simultaneously.
Polygamy was sometimes practiced in ancient Sumer, so it’s entirely
possible that Shimu was married to both women at the same time.
However, there are a couple of problems with this assumption. First,
there’s a specific word for a secondary wife (usar) but this word isn’t used,
it’s just dam, “a wife”. Second, polygamy (maintaining two or more wives)
is an expensive habit, so it was usually reserved for
rich merchants and members of the nobility. We know that Shimu, with at
least one wife
in prostitution, was neither rich nor noble. Nonetheless, it's still possible
that Shimu is
married to both women at the same time. Remember, these tablet were
probably written
within the same year.
It’s also possible that "Shimu" is actually two different men with the same
name.
But... really? Two different men named Shimu consorting with known
prostitutes?
And marrying them? I’m not buying it. It's the same Shimu, there’s no
question about it.
Shimu
I tried to give Shimu the benefit of the doubt. I thought, “Perhaps after the
death of his
beloved wife A-lal, Shimu married her dearest friend, Nin-men, and they
comforted
each other during their loss.” Or perhaps Shimu was a decent man who
married
“the prostitute with a heart of gold” (Nin-men). Or something like that. I

wanted to believe it.
Then I remembered that Nin-men was still a prostitute after she married
Shimu. There’s
just no getting around that one central fact. Again, this tells us everything
we need to know
about Shimu.
With one, and probably two wives in prostitution, Shimu is a very
unsavory character.
It would be difficult to find another man in history who married an active
prostitute that
continued to practice her profession after her marriage. It would be
doubly difficult to find
a man who married two prostitutes (either consecutively or
simultaneously).
A woman of
Diqdiqqeh
I’m beginning to doubt the validity of these so-called marriages. I'm
thinking they are
sham marriages. Perhaps each marriage was a pretense that the women
willing agreed to,
for their own personal reasons. Maybe Shimu promised to make “honest
women” of them.
If this is what Nin-men thought, she was sorely mistaken, because her

15 of 18 8/18/2020, 4:46 PM



prostitution continued after her marriage. In any case, I believe Shimu
“married” these women (legitimately or not) so he could use them.
Again, what kind of man would do such a thing?
I’ll tell you what kind of man – a pimp. That kind of man.
Shimu had two wives in prostitution, and he lived off their earnings. Even
if both women
were already prostitutes, Shimu kept them that way, even after marriage.
He probably
did it in the usual way, through lies and manipulation, threats and
violence. In my opinion,
Shimu is a predator, preying on the most vulnerable women in society. I
think he was
building his own little harem.
I therefore suggest that Shimu is the first pimp known to history.
I have no proof of it, but that’s what I’m saying.
If you don’t believe me, then just ask yourself, “What kind of man keeps a
wife (or two)
in prostitution?"
Anyway, that’s my opinion. In the meantime, I’ll let the readers make up
their own minds about Shimu, his character and his motives.

Ama-ab (Amab)
prostitute
Besides the three tablets from Shuruppak, this ED IIIb tablet from Girsu is
one of only four administrative tablets listed on the CDLI that mention a
prostitute (CDLI 020349).
The tablets are ED IIIb.
This leads us to the question: Why are these the only tablets that mention
prostitutes?
Obviously, there were plenty of prostitutes in the ED III period (2600
2340 BC), but they
don’t show up on any other tablets. Neither do they show up on the
hundreds of thousands
of administrative tablets during the 340 years remaining in Sumerian
history. "Prostitute"
appears on some lexical and literary tablets in the Babylonian period
(2000 – 1600 BC)
but not on any administrative tablets. There is no mention of prostitutes
receiving rations
along with all the other workers in Sumerian society. Basically, the
prostitutes disappear
from the public record. Why is that?
Here’s my best guess: I think the women resented being labeled as
prostitutes every time they received their rations (whether or not it was
true). I believe that in deference to these women, the administrators
accepted the polite custom of simply labeling them as gemes, “female
workers”. I suggest that many of the "female workers" that are listed on
some other administrative tablets were actually prostitutes.

The Babylonian Woman

This bas-relief is part of a small plaque from Diqdiqqeh, a suburb of the
Sumerian city of Ur.
The plaque is dated ca. 1850 – 1500 BC, during the Old Babylonian

period. It is part of a collection in the British Museum. Leonard Woolley
found it during the 1931 excavation of Ur.
I found it while searching the website UrOnline. The plaque was originally
a full-length nude, but it was broken in half. There are many similar
plaques from Diqdiqqeh. They were made
for mass production. Clay was formed in molds and then fired in a kiln.
Many of the plaques are depictions of naked prostitutes.
Woolley’s drawing of the plaque, from his field notes. See the entire page.
Woolley describes her as a "nude female figure in high relief; missing from
hips down;
slightly rounded back; carefully made; round face; hair arranged in curls
and ringlets;
hands clasped together below breast."

Actual size. Height: 64mm (2.5 inches)
For the sake of reference, I call her The Babylonian Woman. I wanted to
call her
The Woman of Diqdiqqeh, but I haven't the slightest idea how to
pronounce "Diqdiqqeh".
I first planned to use this picture of the statue on a new page about
Babylonian prostitutes.
She’s not really a prostitute, but I wanted to use this image because she is
easily
the most attractive woman that is portrayed on the Diqdiqqeh plaques.
Her face is very realistic. It looks like it was modeled from real life. Her
face has the features
of an actual woman, and not just the generic features of a stereotypical
female.
After I realized this was a portrait of an actual woman, it no longer seemed
appropriate
to include her on the prostitute page (since she wasn't really a prostitute)
so I decided
to place her somewhere else on the website.
There was only one problem.
Unfortunately, the statue is marred by damage to the woman’s breasts. It’s
very unsightly,
and rather disturbing. It ruins the picture.

Normally, I would just find another picture to use, but in this case, I didn’t
have a lot of choices. Many of the female faces from Diqdiqqeh are either
damaged, or ugly, or both.
Not to mention... bizarre.
Enlarge
Many of the faces were crude to begin with, but the ravages of time has
rendered them grotesque. Many of the figures are caricatures,
intentionally or not.
With so little to choose from, I needed to use the picture of The
Babylonian Woman.
I tried to remedy the situation by cropping the picture and making it into a
“head shot”,
a portrait of her face, but then the image lost all meaning.

I also tried to post the picture “as is”, but I couldn’t get used to it. It
bothered me. It just bothered me.
Damage on statues of human beings can sometimes look like wounds on
their bodies.
In this case, it looks like the Babylonian woman had suffered a grievous
injury, like she
had been in a terrible accident. It is painful to look at.
I decided to photographically repair the statue, for the exact same reason
that I restored the face of Eannatum (several years ago).

This is King Eannatum, heroically leading his charging chariots to victory,
but it looks like
he has suffered a hideous facial wound, ghastly to behold. I couldn’t bear
to look at it.
It’s unsettling to see the king in this condition, so I decided to digitally
repair the picture and restore the king to his former glory. I spent many
hours doing it, but for me, it was worth it.
This is how Eannatum the Great is supposed to look. See the entire
picture.
I also did the same thing for Sargon, Ku-Baba, the king on the Standard of
Ur, and the Sumerian Queen of Queens.
I recently finished work on another plaque from Diqdiqqeh:

I wanted to photographically restore The Babylonian Woman to her
former condition,
so people could see her the way she looked before.
I started working on the statue. The first part was the easy part. Within a
minute I had
blotted out all the damage. The hard part was trying to create the contours
of the breasts,
and to make them blend in with the rest of the body. This required the
blending of light and shadows. I didn't have to do a complete restoration,
because for some inexplicable reason, none of the 100+ nudes portrayed
on the Diqdiqqeh plaques have nipples.
The restoration took many hours of painstaking work, and I wasn't too
sure if I could achieve
the desired result. Several times I wondered, “Why am I wasting my time
with this?"
At last, I finally finished. This is how The Babylonian Woman is supposed
to look:

for less than a minute before I covered up the damage. Then I noticed
something odd.
I thought, “Why is the worst damage confined only to the breasts?”
The entire statue is damaged, of course, since it is more than thirty-five
centuries old.
Besides being broken in half, there is cracking, pitting, and erosion across
the entire
surface area. But this damage is minor and it's evenly spread. It’s only in
the breast area
that the damage is localized and severe.
I thought maybe the damage occurred when the statue was buried so long
ago in the
ancient past. Perhaps the breasts, being the “high spots”, were susceptible
to damage
by weight and abrasion while the statue was buried in debris for
thousands of years.
Then I decided, “No, that’s not it.” I had seen a hundred of these statues. I
remembered
that the face and hands are the high spots, not the breasts. Any damage
done by weight
and abrasion would happen to the face and hands. It would be difficult
(but not impossible)
to damage only the breasts without also damaging the face and hands.

Profile of a similar
statue.
When I looked again at the statue of The Babylonian Woman, I was
shocked by what I saw.
This kind of damage isn’t done by weight or abrasion, or by cracking,
pitting, and erosion.
There is no natural cause that could result in this kind of damage. The
breasts were
repeatedly struck, chipped away by a knife or a chisel. Notice the wedge
shaped profile

of the blade.
It seems that the statue of The Babylonian Woman was deliberately and
sexually mutilated.
I didn’t want to believe it. I thought, “If the breasts were deliberately
damaged, it seems
someone would have mentioned it before now.” I went looking for the
original record.
I thought maybe I had missed something in the liner notes.
When I found the original record for the statue, there was no mention of
the damage done
to the breasts. Neither does the damage appear in Leonard Woolley’s
drawing.
I looked again at the statue.
The patina on the damage is the same as the surrounding stone. If it were
done recently,
the damage would be a lighter color. This means the damage was done in
ancient times.
This is probably when the statue was broken in half and then thrown into
the trash.
The statue is terracotta, fired in a kiln. It is very hard, which is why it
lasted for thousands
of years. It would take considerable force to damage this statue. The marks
on the breasts indicate that they were repeatedly struck by a sharp knife.
On the other hand, the marks may indicate “pressure points”. The knife
was pressed hard
against the statue, then twisted to chip away the stone.
Either way, it took a deliberate, focused effort to sexually mutilate this
statue.
It’s very disturbing. One has to wonder about the man who did this. Did he
hate all women,
or just one woman in particular?

All this talk about damage to the breasts has distracted us from the true
meaning and
importance of this statue. It’s not her breasts that are important, it’s her
face, and what’s
most meaningful about this statue is the Babylonian woman herself. These
are the reasons
why I wanted to include her picture in the first place.
The Babylonian woman looks at you with a calm and steady gaze.
Woolley’s description of the statue as being “carefully made” applies
especially to the face.
It isn’t crude or comical like some of the other faces on the Diqdiqqeh
plaques, nor is it
simply a generic portrait of "a woman", like all the other female faces in
Mesopotamian art.
The round face and the plump cheeks, the rounded nose and the small
mouth... Her face
is very distinctive, very individualistic. She isn't beautiful in the classic
sense of the word,
but her face is pretty and appealing. She has her own look going on.
The artist clearly patterned the face on the features of a woman he knew.
Perhaps she was
his wife or his girlfriend, or perhaps she was merely a woman that he
found attractive.

Unlike most nudes portrayed on the Diqdiqqeh plaques, she isn't a
prostitute. She doesn’t perform the lewd gesture of “cupping the breasts”
that is specific to prostitutes, she doesn’t wear a belt, and she doesn’t wear
jewelry (all of this is explained on the page about Babylonian Prostitutes).
This statue is simply a nude, tastefully and artistically done. It expresses
an appreciation
for the beauty of the female body, as so often seen in Greek and Roman
statuary (but not
so much in the ancient Near East). This is another reason why I think the
woman was personally known by the artist. He did not, for prurient
reasons, create this statute to be
a prostitute. He created it to be a realistic portrait of a woman he knew
(and probably loved).
Although the Babylonian woman doesn't look like any other woman in
Mesopotamian art,
I suggest that somewhere in Diqdiqqeh, in the second millennium BC,
there was a woman
who looked just like this:

The Babylonian Woman. She is described on a separate page that I
wrote in
January, 2019. You may want to read that page before proceeding with
this one,
although it isn’t absolutely necessary.
This bas-relief is part of a small plaque from Diqdiqqeh, a suburb in the
city of Ur.
The terracotta plaque was formed in a mold and then fired in a kiln. It is
dated in the
Old Babylonian period (ca. 1850 – 1500 BC). Sir Leonard Woolley found it
during his archaeological expedition in 1931.
Her face is very realistic. It looks like it was modeled from real life. Her
face has the features
of an actual woman, and not just the generic features of a stereotypical
female. With her
rounded face and nose, she is very distinctive, very individualistic. She
doesn’t look like
the hundreds of other women that are portrayed on the Diqdiqqeh
plaques.
The artist clearly patterned the face on the features of a woman he knew.
Yesterday, while I was researching a new page about Babylonian
prostitutes, I came across the statue that is shown below. At first, I
thought it was another casting from the same mold. Then I realized that
the angle of the arms is different.

I suggest this is another portrait of The Babylonian Woman. It is the same
woman, sculpted by the same artist.
Leonard Woolley found this statue in 1928, three years before The
Babylonian Woman
was discovered. Both statues now reside in the British Museum.

See the original record at
UrOline.
This is Father Leon Legrain’s notecard. Click here to enlarge the picture.
Woolley’s notes describe the statue as a “terracotta figurine. Moulded.
Female figure,
full face, nude, hands clasped below breasts. Hair dressed with vertical
lines to forehead,
and heavy back full with horizontal waves. Good model. Broken off at
hips.”
Woolley states that the statue has a “full face” and it’s a “good model”. He
said the statue of The Babylonian Woman has a “round face” and it’s
“carefully made”. It’s like he is talking about the same statue.

In my opinion, this is clearly the same woman. The only difference is the
expression
on her face. On the left, she looks at you with a calm and steady gaze. On
the right,
she gazes at you with a look of bemused self-confidence. The statues
resemble each other.
They don’t resemble anybody else.
I had earlier written that the artist created the statue of The Babylonian
Woman “to be a realistic portrait of a woman he knew (and probably
loved). Perhaps she was his wife or his girlfriend...”

For that reason, I call this statue The Babylonian Wife, to distinguish her
from
The Babylonian Woman. It’s two different statues of the same person.
dam = spouse = wife
The artist created two “carefully modeled” statues of the same woman.
That has to
mean something. It seems to me there’s a love story here. It’s a story about
a man,
a young artist, who loved his wife.
I always thought she was based on a real woman. So, in conclusion, I will
close with the
same words that I used to end the page about The Babylonian Woman:
Somewhere in Diqdiqqeh, in the second millennium BC, there was a
woman who looked
just like this:

A brief description of Babylonian prostitutes in history, art, and
literature:

food to the poor man. Lugalbanda in the mountain cave: c.1.8.2.1, lines

1) Cupping the breasts:
There are many examples of nude or semi-nude women cupping their
breasts in this
provocative "come hither" pose. See another example. They are commonly
labeled
simply as "women", but they are actually prostitutes − every single one of
them.
Cupping their breasts is not just one of many suggestive poses performed
by the women.
Basically, it is the only suggestive pose, so this gesture clearly has a
symbolic meaning.
In Babylonian art, it is the hallmark of a prostitute. Simply put, if a woman
is performing
this gesture, she is a prostitute.
Coincidentally, I recently saw a movie where a modern prostitute did the
exact same thing
on the streets of New York City. She advertised her services to a
prospective client
by cupping her breasts. Apparently, some things haven't changed too
much in the

world’s oldest profession.
In a case of art imitating life (or vice versa) ...
This woman is fully clothed, but she is also cupping her breasts This is
how you could recognize a Babylonian prostitute on a city street. She wore
clothes in public, of course;
she didn't parade around in the nude. Cupping her breasts in her hands
was a signal to a prospective client that she was a prostitute, ready and
available. The signal may have been subtle when the authorities were
around, or not so subtle when the coast was clear.
In ancient Mesopotamia, prostitution wasn’t a criminal offense like it is in
America today. Nonetheless, there has always been a prejudice against
prostitutes. The authorities
always placed restrictions on how, when, and where a prostitute could
practice her trade.
Even a benign king like Gudea banished all prostitutes from the city
during the dedication
of a new temple (see Munus-kin on this website). According to the laws of
Tiglath-pileser (Middle Assyrian period, ca. 1400-1000 BC), if a prostitute
was caught in public

wearing the veil of a married woman, she was flogged fifty times with a
stave, and then
hot tar was poured on her head.
2) Jewelry:
The pearls of a prostitute are placed around your neck, and you are
likely to snatch a man from the tavern. A hymn to Inanna as Ninegala
(Inanna D): c.4.07.4, lines 109 -115.
Women who are portrayed nude except for jewelry are prostitutes. The
jewelry was part of the identifying “insignia” of a prostitute. Many of the
women wore several beaded necklaces. Presumably, the more jewelry, the
more desirable the prostitute, like a “high class call girl”,
as opposed to a lower-class streetwalker. The jewelry may also be part of
how she
conducted her business. At this stage in history there was no such thing as
Babylonian Prostitutes about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/999701/1072501.html

“money”.
There was no paper currency or metal coins, so perhaps the beads were
how she was paid (the beads were a kind of portable wealth). It has also
been suggested the necklaces were made of distinctive seashells that
clearly identified the woman as a prostitute.
In addition to the necklace, many prostitutes also wore bracelets (as
shown above) and anklets.
3) The belt:
See a similar statue. It looks the same, but it’s actually
different.
This broad belt was made of cloth or leather.
For some reason, a Babylonian prostitute often wore a belt, sometimes
several. Many of the belts seem to be made of beads. Other belts are finer
in appearance, suggesting they were made of thin chains of gold or silver.

5) Tavern scenes:
Surprisingly, brothels were not the main centers of prostitution in ancient
Babylonia.
Most prostitution occurred in the temples of Inanna (also surprising) and
in taverns.
I was able to find only one reference to a brothel in Babylonian writing. It
is The Cursing of Agade, which describes a bloody curse laid upon the city
by the gods because of the impiety of its king (Naram-Sin):
May your cattle slaughterer slaughter his wife, may your sheep butcher
butcher his child! May your prostitute hang herself at the entrance to her
brothel! May your pregnant (?) priestesses and cult prostitutes abort (?)
their children! The Cursing of Agade: c.2.1.5,
lines 222 - 244.
Even so, the translation of eš2-dam as “brothel” is somewhat problematic.
It is also defined as “a tavern”.
Of the eight literary works on the ETCSL that mention prostitutes, six of
them also mention taverns and inns.

There are many examples of a man and a woman having sex while the
woman drinks beer
from a long straw (it’s a double entendre, in case you haven’t figured that
out already).
I suggest the pot of beer indicates that the action is taking place in a
tavern.
I further suggest that the woman is a prostitute. The graphic nature of the
scene implies
that the man isn’t making love to his wife or girlfriend, he is having sex
with a prostitute.

10 of 31 8/18/2020, 4:49 PM



All similar examples (and there are many of them, it’s a common motif)
are depictions
of men consorting with prostitutes in taverns.
All except this one:
This cylinder seal impression is described on a separate page. See In
Flagrante Delicto.
When I sit in the alehouse, I am a woman, and I am an exuberant young
man. When I am present at a place of quarrelling, I am a woman, a
figurine brought to life. When I sit by the gate of the tavern, I am a
prostitute familiar with the penis; the friend of a man,
the girlfriend of a woman. A šir-namšub to Inanna (Inanna I): c.4.07.9,
lines 16 - 22
The close association of taverns and prostitution makes Ku-Baba’s rise to
power seem
all the more remarkable. Ku-Baba was the “female tavern keeper” who
became the
queen of Kish. See Queen Ku-Baba on this website.

A Babylonian prostitute reduced to the bare essentials. We know she is a
prostitute, and not just a regular woman, because she is nude and wearing
multiple belts.
7) Anatomical features (or the lack thereof):
Even a crude rendition, like the one shown above, highlights an unusual
feature on many depictions of Babylonian prostitutes:

Belly markings. Many of the prostitutes have mysterious lines on their
abdomens.
Some of the lines look like they could be jewelry, but other lines are not
attached anywhere.
They do not hang from the neck like a necklace and they do not go all
around the waist
like a belt.

As shown in a group photo, some of the prostitutes have the belly
markings
and some of them do not. The meaning of the markings isn’t known.
In many cases (as shown above and below) the size of the vagina is
intentionally exaggerated.

15 of 31 8/18/2020, 4:49 PM



Note the artistic attention to detail. This anatomical feature is seen on
many portrayals of Babylonian prostitutes.
On the other hand, in more than 100 depictions of Diqdiqqeh prostitutes,
none of them have nipples. Not a single one. It seems odd that the artists
had no qualms about showing the
“you-know-what” but they somehow felt bashful about showing a nipple.
It’s very strange.
There must have been a very good reason for this widely accepted artistic
convention,
but I don’t know what it is.
Temple prostitutes
As previously mentioned, the temples of Inanna (also called Ishtar) were
the centers of

Some modern writers have expressed doubts that temple prostitutes
actually existed, but there is simply too much evidence (in history, art, and

there isn't any evidence for it.
The quintessential Inanna, the winged goddess of lust and war, is shown
here with weapons bristling behind her while she is “showing some leg”.
She wears a helmet with many horns, indicating that she is a major
goddess (the more horns, the higher the rank).

Inanna herself is often portrayed as a prostitute. Here she is shown nude,
wearing only a necklace and two bracelets, just like the other prostitutes
shown on this page. Although crude, the picture is very graphic, which is
perhaps none too surprising. Several works of Babylonian literature make
repeated references to Inanna’s genitals.

Inanna is also shown cupping her breasts like a common prostitute.
I suggest the above two pictures, by themselves, are enough to prove the
existence of
sacred prostitution in ancient Babylonia. If the goddess herself is
portrayed as a prostitute,
then it shouldn't be too surprising that prostitutes served in her temple.
It’s odd that a major goddess is graphically portrayed as a common
prostitute. In any other religion, it would be considered blasphemous. For
instance, Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, is never shown in graphic
and demeaning ways. It seems that the Babylonian artists would be
apprehensive about portraying a goddess in this pornographic manner,
especially Inanna. She could be violent, even psychotic. She was a very
scary woman.
It wasn’t just the artists who portrayed Inanna as a prostitute, it was the
writers as well. "Inanna the prostitute" was a common motif.
The passage quoted earlier about “the pearls of a prostitute” refers to
Inanna herself:
[...] then, my lady, like the nameless poor, you wear only a single
garment. The pearls of a prostitute are placed around your neck, and
you are likely to snatch a man from the tavern.

prostitutes. Some of the statues are merely “nudes”, artistic works that
express an appreciation for the beauty
of the female body:
These women are not prostitutes. They do not perform the specific gesture

cupping their breasts and they do not wear jewelry or a belt.

This translation of “male prostitute” (saĝ-ur-saĝ, pronounced sang-ur
sang) is misleading.
The Sumerian Lexicon has it defined as “a eunuch”.
Tightening their hairgrips for her, male prostitutes parade before her,
holy Inanna.
Their locks of hair at the back are adorned for her with colored rags;
they parade
before her, holy Inanna. Clothed in the leather of divinity, they parade
before her,
holy Inanna. A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan (Iddin-Dagan
A): c.2.5.3.1,
lines 49 – 58.
Sounds kinky, doesn’t it? But there’s something wrong with this picture.
“Male prostitutes” gives the impression the men are homosexuals, so one
has to wonder,
“Why would Inanna, the female goddess of lust, have any use for
homosexual men?”
A quick look at the transliteration reveals the answer: Each “male
prostitute” is actually
a saĝ-ur-saĝ, a eunuch, which makes a lot more sense. Eunuchs were the
only men who
could be completely trusted to serve in a temple of women. Apparently
some eunuchs
achieved a very high status in the performance of their duty, since saĝ-ur
saĝ is also
defined as a “royal attendant, a powerful servant”, just like the eunuchs in
ancient China.
(Note: The high-priestess in the temple was not a prostitute, since a high
priestess was always a highborn noblewoman. The other priestesses in the
temple were ladies of the
lesser nobility. The temple prostitutes themselves were either commoners
or slaves.)

You should not buy a prostitute: she is a mouth that bites. [...] You should

The Instructions of Šuruppag: c.5.6.1, lines 154 - 164.
This passage underscores a tragic feature of Babylonian prostitution that
is often
overlooked. It began thousands of years before the Babylonian period.
It harkens back to the very beginning of Mesopotamia civilization, to the
Sumerian era,
when the signs for “prostitute” were first written down.
Kar-kid means “prostitute”. Geme2 is a professional designation, meaning
Babylonian Prostitutes about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/999701/1072501.html
24 of 31 8/18/2020, 4:49 PM



“a female worker, servant, or slave”. Geme2 is composed of two signs,
munus, “woman”, and kur, “mountain/eastern/foreign country.” A
"female worker or servant” is a native-born woman.
A “female slave” is literally “a foreign woman from the eastern
mountains”.
Enlarge.
Babylonia was composed of the regions formerly known as Sumer and
Akkad (and beyond).
To the east were the lands of Elam and Gutium, in the Zagros Mountains
(modern-day Iran).
Geme2-kar-kid implies that many Babylonian prostitutes were slaves
from Elam and Gutium.
As indicated by the quote, “you should bring down a foreign slave from the
mountains”,
a slave woman from the Zagros Mountains was available for purchase. She
may have been
sold into slavery by her own family, who were destitute and possibly facing
starvation.
More likely, she was captured by neighboring tribesmen, who then sold
her to the
Babylonians for a profit.

25 of 31 8/18/2020, 4:49 PM



The most likely explanation is that she was captured by the Babylonians
themselves.
Since the beginning of recorded history, the Sumerians and Akkadians
were often at war
with the Gutian and Elamite tribes. Now it was the Babylonians’ turn to
fight against
the tribesmen. The men and women that were captured in these battles
were the primary source of slaves for the Babylonians (although
sometimes it was the other way around,
when the tribesmen made hit-and-run raids into Babylonian territory).
Prostitution is a hard life for a woman, even under the best of
circumstances. For a slave,
it's the worst of all possible worlds. Not for nothing it is called “a fate
worse than death”.
For the woman, the day of her capture was the beginning of her worst
nightmare. She saw
her village burned to the ground. She witnessed her friends and family
members being
brutally murdered by the rampaging soldiers. She may have been raped by
the soldiers.
Then she was tied up with ropes and force-marched into a hostile foreign
country,
herded into slavery along with the rest of the miserable survivors.

Now began the rest of her unhappy life. If she was “lucky”, she became a
concubine for a
nobleman or a rich merchant, where she only had to deal with the
unwanted attentions
of just one man (or perhaps a few). The next best option was probably to
be a
temple prostitute, where she was afforded some protection, some
"respectability”,
and the company of other women who shared the same fate (misery is
easier to bear
when it is shared with others). The worst option was to be a prostitute in a
tavern or brothel,
where she had to satisfy the desires of many drunken men.
In any case, the captive woman had no rights or status, and little hope of
freedom.
She had no expectation of a normal life. None of her dreams would ever be
fulfilled,
the dreams that most women take for granted, and she had no husband or
children

to love her and to take care of her in her old age.
Sometimes a prostitute slave was eventually given her freedom − when
she was older
and no longer attractive. Then she was turned out on the streets to fend
for herself
so her master didn't have to take care of her when she was old.
“Freelance” Babylonian prostitutes
Of course, not all Babylonian prostitutes were slaves. Some of them were
free-born women who became destitute, and they turned to prostitution as
a temporary solution. For them, unlike for the slaves, there was always
some hope of a better life.

A Babylonian prostitute.
You may be wondering, why do so many of these plaques show
prostitutes?
The plaques pictured on this page were the Babylonian version of
pornography. Remember,
the Babylonians didn’t have paper to draw on. They didn’t have cotton, so
there was no
canvas for painting. If there were any paintings done on wood, they
haven’t survived
the millennia. The plaques were formed in molds and then fired in a kiln,
which is why they
lasted for thousands of years. Many of them portray prostitutes because
this was the
usual form of sex for most young men

A young man and woman in bed. The woman is not cupping her breasts
and she isn’t
wearing jewelry or a belt, so perhaps she isn’t a prostitute.
Then again, maybe she is. I suggest that even if a woman is not clearly
identified as a prostitute (with the cupping of the breasts, the belt, jewelry,
etc.), if she is engaged in sex , she is a prostitute.
In ancient times, a young man didn’t have a lot of opportunities for
premarital sex.
The young women that he knew were under strict parental authority. Plus,
the women
were worried about getting pregnant. Unlike today, they didn’t have access
to birth control
or abortion. In addition, they were concerned about their reputation. They
didn’t want to be
“that kind of girl”, because they were saving themselves for marriage. A
woman with a reputation for promiscuity had very few prospects for
Babylonian Prostitutes about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/999701/1072501.html

finding a husband. Men didn’t want to marry a woman who couldn’t be
trusted to remain faithful after marriage. Once married, a woman still had
the same fears of pregnancy, and she certainly didn’t want to get caught by
her husband. As a result, there weren’t a lot of young women who were
“sleeping around”.
In ancient Babylonia, there was really no such thing as “casual sex”, so if a
man wanted
to get laid, he had only one real option: prostitutes. By all accounts, the
prostitutes
were cheap (“food for the poor man”) and plentiful.
That is why there are so many depictions of prostitutes in Babylonian art.
If an artist
wanted to portray the usual sexual experience, he didn’t think in terms of
“Sex and
the Single Girl”. He didn’t think in terms of married women. He thought
only in terms
of prostitutes.
Sure, this plaque may show a married couple making love, but it probably
shows a man
having sex with a prostitute, and it thus reflects the sexual mores of
Babylonian society.

she is

translator of
ancient inscriptions) during the early expeditions at Ur (1924 – 1926).
There has been a lot of discussion and speculation about Babylonian
temple prostitutes,
but everyone naturally assumed there weren't any pictures of them.
Ironically, this portrait of a temple prostitute was discovered almost 100
years ago,
and it's not the only one.
Before proceeding, first it is necessary to give some background
information:
“Sacred” prostitute
In Babylonia, the temples of Inanna were the centers of “sacred
prostitution”. Inanna was
the goddess of lust and war. It may be difficult for a modern reader to
comprehend, but prostitutes were actually employed in her temple to
serve the goddess by servicing men.
Presumably, any fees that were collected were used for the maintenance of
the temple.
The first time the western world heard of this peculiar institution was
from Herodotus,
the Greek historian (ca. 484 – 425 BC). In The Histories, he writes:
“Every woman born in the country must once in her life go and sit down in
the precinct
of Venus [Inanna, also known as Ishtar], and there consort with a
stranger.... A woman
who has once taken her seat is not allowed to return home till one of the
strangers
throws a silver coin into her lap, and takes her with him beyond the holy
ground....
The silver coin maybe of any size....
The woman goes with the first man who throws her money, and rejects no
one.
When she has gone with him, and so satisfied the goddess, she returns
home,
and from that time forth no gift however great will prevail with her. Such
Babylonian Temple Prostitutes about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/999701/1064401.html
4 of 18 8/18/2020, 4:51 PM



of the women....
who are ugly have to stay a long time before they can fulfil the law. Some
have waited
three or four years in the precinct.”
The story is, of course, ridiculous. It’s absurd to think that all the fathers
and mothers
of Babylonia consented to the prostitution of their beloved daughters.
Herodotus related
this story to emphasize the superiority of the Greeks compared to the
decadent Orientals
and to justify the war between the Greeks and the Babylonians.
The implausibility of the story has prompted some modern scholars to
doubt the existence of temple prostitutes. However, although it didn't
involve all Babylonian women, there is ample evidence in Babylonian art
and literature that confirms the practice of sacred prostitution
(see Babylonian Prostitutes).
There is plenty of archaeological evidence as well.

These women are identifiable as prostitutes because they are semi-nude,
wearing jewelry,
and they are cupping their breasts. They are identifiable specifically as
temple prostitutes
because of the uniformity of their apparel, their jewelry, and their
hairstyle.
They are not goddesses.
These statues were found in Susa, which is an Elamite city. They are from
a later period
(1500 - 1100 BC, allegedly). I suggest they are Babylonian, either stolen
from Babylon
as plunder and booty, or taken to Elam by the Babylonians themselves
during periods of
Babylonian occupation.
The statues are not Elamite. If they were, it would imply that the Elamites
also practiced
temple prostitution, but there is absolutely no evidence of this. The
Elamites had a
different religion. On the other hand, the Babylonians had several temples
in Elam.

cheating on him. As I will later explain, there is something very unusual
about this picture.
In flagrante delicto is a legal term, borrowed from Medieval Latin, which
translates as
“in blazing offense”. It basically means “caught in the act”, and it usually
applies to a
sexual situation.
The image is from the Achaemenid period (6th - 4th century BC), so
needless to say,
this is history’s first illustration of in flagrante delicto.
Although it was the first illustration, it certainly wasn’t the last.
In flagrante delicto throughout the ages:

What is so unusual about the Babylonian version of In
Flagrante Delicto?
As previously mentioned, there are many similar scenes in Babylonian art.
They were the Babylonian version of pornography. All of them are
terracotta plaques that were formed
in a mold and then fired in a kiln.

In Flagrante Delicto is different. It was formed by a cylinder seal. (Note:
In this display,
the stone is upside down.)
Cylinder seals with a sexual theme are rare, but they have been around
since the beginning. Leonard Woolley found several in the city of Ur, as
described in Leon Legrain’s book,
Ur Excavations III: Archaic Seal-Impressions. See some examples. Legrain
calls them
"marital scenes". I suggest these seals were not made for identification
purposes, but were created by the seal-engravers as "practice seals"
(during training) or as "novelty items".
A cylinder seal and the impression it makes when rolled across wet clay.
Generally,
a cylinder seal was used for identification. It was the official “signature” of

the owner
(at a time in history when most people didn’t know how to write their
name). Seals
were used to “sign” important documents. See an example of a Sumerian
document
with a seal impression.
Cylinder seals were owned by noblemen, rich merchants, and high
ranking officials.
The owner was often pictured on the seal itself. So it’s inconceivable that a
man would use
the bawdy In Flagrante Delicto as his personal identifier, especially since
it implies that he is either a cuckold or an adulterer (depending on which
man he is in the picture).
I think it’s safe to say that In Flagrante Delicto, unlike thousands of other
cylinder seals, wasn’t used for personal identification. It was only used to
reproduce the erotic image
multiple times. Even so, a cylinder seal is not a practical choice for the
production
of pornography. A cylinder seal is expensive, it’s too small, and it lacks
sufficient detail.
The manufacture of a cylinder seal was a very difficult process. The
engraver had to
carve the hard stone using only simple tools. The images (and lettering, if
present)
had to be carved in both spatial and photographic reverse, so they were
raised
from the surface and facing in the proper direction. For instance, as shown
above,
for the woman to face left, she was engraved facing right (a mirror image).
Counterintuitively, the images that were raised higher on the surface had
to be carved
deeper into the stone. Plus, it was difficult to ensure that the picture fit
precisely on the
round circumference of the cylinder. By necessity, the engraver had to be a
talented artist
and a skilled craftsman. It also it took a long time to create a seal. As a

result, “pictorial” cylinder seals (like the one shown above) were very
expensive, to pay for the many hours of skilled labor. (Other seals with
simple abstract designs were less expensive.)
Left: A clay plaque showing the goddess Inanna. Right: The mold that
was used to form it.
By comparison, the creation of a mold was relatively simple. First, the
image was easily modeled in soft clay, rather than hard stone, and there
was no need to worry about photographic and spatial reverse. Then it was
fired in a kiln to harden it. Afterwards,
the image was covered in clay to form a mold. Then the mold was fired.
The mold was
later used to make countless reproductions.
Ease of manufacture and reduced costs are not the only benefits of a mold
compared to a cylinder seal. There are two other advantages:
First, a mold can be more highly detailed and more three-dimensional
than a cylinder seal.
It can be sculpted in “high relief”, like the Inanna plaque shown above. As
a result, it can produce erotic scenes that are much more realistic.

Second, a mold is usually much larger than a cylinder seal. Cylinders seals
are very small.
It looks larger in the other photographs, but this is the approximate size of
In Flagrante Delicto. Notice how small it is.

For comparison, this is another seal impression. The size is shown relative
to a penny.
Sure, an expensive cylinder seal can make multiple copies of a
pornographic image,
but it isn’t well suited for this purpose, so why was it used?
Here’s what I think:
This seal wasn’t commissioned by a paying customer. It’s difficult to
believe that a client
told a seal engraver, “Imagine there’s a man and woman having sex while
the woman is
drinking beer. You know what I mean? Then the husband shows up!

cylinder seal with this scene. I’ll pay you good money for it.”
I think this cylinder seal was created by the engraver himself, not for
identification purposes,
but for his own amusement. Expense was not an issue because he made it
himself.
His only cost was the nominal price of the stone (yellow marble).
Even so, he didn’t spend a lot of time on it. He did not attempt to sculpt
the curves and
contours of the human figures, making them three-dimensional, like the
other seals
shown on this page. The people on this cylinder seal are very sketchy. They
are drawn
with a few simple lines, and everything is carved to the same shallow
depth.
The engraver wasn’t trying to portray a realistic scene of graphic
pornography. He had a different purpose in mind.
The left half of the picture is similar to many Babylonian plaques.

It’s the right half of the picture that makes it unique. This story is all about
the husband.
Here is the husband. He is very animated.
With one leg up and his hands raised, he may be in a posture of shock and
agitation,
as if he is saying, “Oh my god! What are you doing?!”
On the other hand, he may be running into the room with his arms
outstretched, ready to throttle his wife and her lover.
Either way, it is meant to be comical.

This isn’t pornography, like the other Babylonian plaques. It is a cartoon.
It isn’t meant
to be lewd and lascivious. It is meant to be funny.
A cartoon is defined as “a simple drawing showing the features of its
subjects in a
humorously exaggerated way, especially a satirical one.”
I personally think the seal is Babylonian, and the people portrayed on it
are Elamites,
but that is just my opinion. I think the Babylonian is making fun of the
Elamites.
I’m tempted to say this is the first cartoon in all of history, but the Greeks
probably had
something similar that I don’t know about. In any case, this is possibly the
first cartoon
in Mesopotamian history. It is probably the first sexual cartoon, and it is
most certainly
the first cartoon about in flagrante delicto.
