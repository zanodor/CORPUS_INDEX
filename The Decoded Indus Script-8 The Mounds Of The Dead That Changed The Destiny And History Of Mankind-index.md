The Decoded Indus Script-8
The Mounds Of The Dead That Changed
The Destiny And History Of Mankind
Abstract
According to the prevalent history of Bharata varsha as told by western scholars the Indus valley civilisation belonged to the
Dravida/Munda people and the vedic people(Aryans) reached India around 1900 BCE only . But in reality the Indus civilisation is vedic and the vedic people were in the Indus Valley at least from 8000BCE as seen from excavations and genetic studies.
If an unknown script can explain the known myth and known history of a nation,what more proof is required to show that the script belongs to the same people.The script of Egypt explains
their myth and history.The script of Sumer,Akkad or Elam does the same.So it is natural for the Indus script to denote the myth
and history of the Hindu/Sindhu / Sarasvati/ vindu/vipra/sura/ bhuusura/bhudeva/bharata/kuru/pancala/Somaka people.Hence in this article we shall try to understand a bit of Indian history through the Indus script.We shall presently see a few evidences pointing to the existence of the Aryans in the Indus Valley several millennia prior to the so called Aryan
arrival in the Indus valley.
In the last article we have looked into the writing of the
Harappans in the early Ravi/Kot Diji phases and concluded
that they are the same vedic people of the mature
Harappan phase.



We have also compared an inscribed Ravi sherd showing
presence of the Pancalas/ Bharatas in the Indus valley
before 3300BCE and a Taxila coin showing their presence
in Taxila around 200 BCE confirming the continuity of the
vedic civilisation in the Indus Valley from the early
Harappan days.We have also seen how an indus seal
portray the story of Ahalya described in later literature.
In this article we are exploring the universal idea of the mount of the dead Concept In The Worship Of The Sun God Pancala-Bharata-Somaka-Moksha-Kosala-KurukshetraDharmakshetra concept-in the solar worship as was practised in the IVC and elsewhere. What are the linquistic and ritual logics employed in the practice? Religions are dependent on rituals and rituals are dependent on languages.Hinduism depends on Bharata/pitR/ deva/rava/veda/Sanskrit/Jinakshetra/pan-caala language.Budhism depends on the Paali/vaaNi /heli language.Judaism depends on Hebrew/bruuhi language.Christianity depends on Greek/Latin Lnaguage.Islam depends on Arabic languge.All the religions of the world were dependent on words formulated by the priests of those religions as linquistics played a key role in formulating the belief and ritual tenets of their followers.All these religions and the languages owe a great deal to one religion and langage which was the religion of Gobekli Tepe and its language which is the pitR/Bharata /deva/veda language.The Bharatas of Pancala Ruled The known Ancient World By Using The Mound Of The Dead Concept In The Worship Of The Sun God.

Ancestors are acknowledged and highly honoured in India among the Hindus. In fact traditionally the Brahmans follow the most elaborate system of ancestor veneration by observing the Vishnu-pitR-gotra-kula-agrahaara relationships.When a person



dies, the family observes a thirteen-day mourning period, called sraddha(sira/sura-asta;srashta is pitR). On every anniversary,
they observe the ritual of Tarpan/sravaNa ( ,∏, , , ,

During these rituals, the family prepares the food items which the deceased
liked and offers it to the deceased. They offer this food to
crows(khaga/droNa; khaga-bird,sun;sol-soul) as well on
certain days as it is believed that the soul comes in the
form of a bird to taste it. They are also obliged to offer śrāddha, a small feast of specific preparations, to eligible
Brahmins. Narayana Bali is performed to satisfy the unsatisfied desires of the ancestor's souls which are trapped in this world. The unsatisfied souls of ancestors cause problems in the
household . Narayan Bali Pooja is nothing but offerings to Lord Vishnu(pitR).

is su-Nr/suura-ma(king).Hence these signs are made on the body of agni(Brahmin) to indicate that they are agni,who is covered with ash/bhasma(bha-jina/jana).

Since bhadra/the bull indicate full/dasa(ten),spearing the bull can indicate a full(bull)-kanta(soma-moon;PuurNamaasa)
oblation/sacrifice .Ka-aNDa(king’s phallus) enters pattamahishi in the asvamedha/mAtANDa sacrifice also.
Each year, on the particular date when the person had died, the family members repeat this ritual.
Apart from this, there is also a fortnight-long duration each year
called pitR paksha ("fortnight of ancestors"), when the family remembers all its ancestors and offers "Tarpan" to them. This
period falls just before the Navaratri or Dasra/Durga puja
falling in the month of Asvina.Mahalaya marks the end of the fortnight-long Tarpan to the ancestors. The life philosophy of the vedic people is very simple.It shows you where to take refuge.For putra(children) the refuge is PitR(father,parents).For praja/nara the refuge is Bharata(bhadra/Narayana-king,government;potR/hotRpriest,agni,Vishnu).For life the refuge is niryana/nirvana/svarga(sva-agra) death itself. The practice of ancestor worship in Punjab is called Jathera
(JaDha-dead body or jyeshtha which means the
elder;satra;sarpa satra-svar/sarva/visva/visnu/pitR satra), in Haryana ancestor worship of the village deity is called dhok



(from dahak -fire, meaning fire worship). The paliya memorial
stones are associated with ancestral worship in western
India.

The Romans, like many Mediterranean societies, regarded the bodies of the dead as polluting. During Rome's Classical period, the body was most often cremated, and the ashes placed in a tomb outside the city walls. Much of the month of
February was devoted to purifications, propitiation, and veneration of the dead, especially at the nine-day festival of
the Parentalia during which a family honored its ancestors.
The Parentalia drew to a close on February 21 with the Feralia, a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the Manes, the potentially malevolent spirits of the dead who required propitiation. One of the most common inscriptional phrases on
Latin epitaphs is Dis Manibus, abbreviated D.M, "for the Manes gods(Asvins)", which appears even on some Christian tombstones. The Caristia on February 22 was a celebration of the family line as it continued into the present.

A noble Roman family displayed ancestral images in the
tablinium(cf.dolmen) of their home. Caristia (Christ is its continuation.Christians observe the all soul’s day on November 2nd .Early christens often
assembled in cemeteries for their japa/sava/sabha rituals).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caristia In ancient Rome, the Caristia,or the Cara Cognatio, was an official but privately observed holiday on February 22, that celebrated love of family with banqueting and gifts. Families gathered to dine together and offer food and incense to the Lares as their household gods. It was a day of reconciliation when disagreements were to be set aside.
The Caristia was one of several days in February that honored family or ancestors. It followed the Parentalia, nine days of remembrance which began on February 13 and concluded with



the Feralia on February 21, or the Caristia on the next day. For
the Parentalia, families visited the tombs of their ancestors
and shared cake and wine(cf.the eucharist.The church is a
family) both in the form of offerings and as a meal among themselves. The Feralia was a more somber occasion, a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the Manes, the spirits of the dead who required propitiation. The Caristia was a recognition of the family line as it continued into the present and among the living.
Göbekli Tepe
Let us begin with Go(sky,sun,ray,cow,star;kha-well,pot,sun)bekli (agni/vahni/vahana/bahula)-Tepe/piiTha/pada.It shows sunrise/rising sun,especially at the equinox.This pot is held by
Gudea (Surya/udaya/go-udaya/udayagiri).

Location: Ören(AruNa/Varuna/paNa/giri/srii→Go-sun,hill)cik(sikha/saala/bahula/sikhi→Pancala/Kusika), Sanliurfa Province,Turkey.There is very close relation for this sanctuary



with the Indus valley civilisation sites.The site was founded in the tenth millennium BCE or earlier and abandoned in the eighth millennium BCE.It belongs to the perods of Pre-pottery Neolithic A to B.

, ", is an archaeological site inancient Anatolia region of Turkey,near the city of Sanliurfa. The tell has a height of 15 m (49 ft) and is about 300 m (980 ft) in diameter, approximately 760 m (2,490 ft) above sea level.
In 1996, Klaus Schmidt of the German Archeological Institute, who had previously been working at Nevali Cori, began excavating Gobekli Tepe in collaboration with the Sanliurfa
Museum, and soon unearthed the first of the huge T-shaped
pillars. He continued the excavations from1996 until his death in 2014.
Schmidt believed that the site was a sanctuary where people from a wide region periodically congregated for worshipping the dead(sava-sun,corpse), not a settlement.

The tell includes two phases of ritual use (cf.god on the mound; mount Kailas, Mount Horeb,mount Sinai,mount Tabor,mount
Golgotha etc.) dating back to the 10th–8th millennium BCE. During the first phase, belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic
A (PPNA), circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars ,
were erected – the world's oldest known megaliths. More than
200 pillars(ten make dasaraja ;dasam-10;dasmalord;dasra-asvina-adhvara;masta-head;matsaPisces;mastaba-pyramid;aasanda-vishnu,aasandi-seat) in
about 20 circles are currently known(hence 20 Dasarajas
performed here). Each pillar has a height of up to 6 m
(20 ft=5*4=Caturaha/Pancala/nakshatra , , , ) and weighs up to 20 tons. In the second phase, belonging to thePre-Pottery Neolithic B(PPNB), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime. The site was abandoned after the PPNB. Younger structures date to classical times.
Each pillar being a bhadra/patra/vi it is

Gobekli Tepe belonged to Leo/Deo/Anatolia(sunrise) sign as the vernal equinox was in the constellation of Leo.It is
at present in Pisces and closing in on Aquarius,the seventh sign of Leo/the sury vansa races.The opening
up of Gobekli Tepe/Indus valley indicate the forthcoming change of the ages,with a new age of the vedic people dawning on the horizon of Human civilisations.

The Sun's apparent vernal equinox position has continuously shifted along the ecliptic by about 1 degree every 72 years due to precessional wobbling by interactions with the Sun and
Moon.The earth’s pole describes a 47 degree circle through the sky every 25920 years. Consequently, all the
thirteen zodiac constellations will house the vernal equinox
point during this 25920 year cycle. According to astronomer
Jean Meeus, the vernal equinox point crossed the AriesPisces border in 68 BCE. In AD 2597, the vernal equinox
will move into Aquarius the Water Bearer.But astronomers
will continue to refer to the vernal equinox as the "First Point of



Aries as the first point of Aries is the spring equinox corresponding to dawn(usha/aja)/east and not any fixed stars.

cycle as mysterious — for national events in general and
those of the Āryan Hindu nation especially — as it is
important. The names of the five cycles or Yugas are:
Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idvatsara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara.
According to Hindu tradition, the Rigvedic hymns were collected by Paila under the guidance of Vyāsa(Yadava/ yajna/Yaska), who compiled the Rigveda Samhita as we see it today. As per the Śatapatha Brāhmana, the number of
syllables in the Rigveda is 432,000, equalling the number
of muhurtas (1 day = 30 muhurtas) in forty years. This statement shows the connection (bandha) the Vedic books maintain in the astronomical, the physiological, and the spiritual fields through continuous observations made for thousands of years. There are cycles within greater cycles, which are all contained in the one Kalpa(Mal.pakal-day;bha-sun;kal-stone,to
count)/ kalabha(bindu/vishnu)/ varsha(svar/sun) , of 4,320,000 years.Samvarta is pralaya(death). In the 1,326 places in the New Testament, where the word “God” is mentioned, nothing signifies that in God
are included more beings than God. On the contrary in 17 places God is called the only God. The places where the Father is so called amount to 320. In 105 places God is addressed with high-sounding titles. In 90 places all prayers and thanks are addressed to the Father; 300 times in the New Testament is the Son declared to be
inferior to the Father; 85 times is Jesus called the “Son of Man”; 70 times is he called a man. In not one single place in the Bible is it said that God holds within him three different Beings or Persons, and yet is one Being or
Person. — Dr. Karl von Bergen’s Lectures in Sweden. Blavatsky on the Secret Cycles v. 17.11, www.philaletheians.co.uk, 13 July 2017



secret doctrine’s third proposition series
cycles and avataras(vatsaras).
In the end of the Yuga ,Kalki-Avatāra is expected — the
Avatāra whose name and characteristics are secret,who will come forth from Śambhala(stambha/vatsara), the “City of
Gods,” which is in the West for some nations, in the East for others, in the North or South for yet others. And this is the reason why,from the Indian Rishi to Virgil,and from Zoroaster down to the latest Sibyl,all have, since the beginning of the Fifth Race, prophesied, sung, and promised the cyclic return of the
Virgin — Virgo,the constellation — and the birth of a divine
child who should bring back to our earth the Golden Age.
As Colebrooke found out, it is the cycle of the Vedas, recorded in the Jyotisha, one of the Vedāngas, a treatise on Astronomy, which is the basis of calculation for all other cycles, larger or smaller; and the Vedas were written in characters, archaic
though they be, long after those natural observations, made by the aid of their gigantic mathematical and astronomical instruments, had been recorded by the men of the
Third Race,who had received their instruction from the
Dhyāni-Chohans. Thomas Maurice speaks truly when he observes that all such . . .Circular stone monuments were
intended as durable symbols of astronomical cycles by a race who, not having,or [for political reasons] forbidding the use of letters, had no other permanent method of instructing their disciples,or handing down their
knowledge to posterity.
He errs only in the last idea. It was to conceal their knowledge from profane posterity,leaving it as an heirloom only to the Initiates, that such monuments, at once rock observatories
and astronomical treatises, were cut out.
It is no news that as the Hindus divided the earth into seven zones, so the more western peoples — Chaldæans,
Phoenicians, and even the Jews, who got their learn
ing either directly or indirectly from the Brāhmans — made
all their secret and sacred numerations by 6 and 12, though using the number 7 whenever this would not



lend itself to handling. Thus the numerical base of
6,the exoteric figure given by Āryabhatta, was made good use
of. From the first secret cycle of 600 — the Naros,
transformed successively into 60,000 and 60 and 6, and,with other noughts added into other secret cycles — down to the
smallest, an Archaeologist and Mathematician can easily find
it repeated in every country, known to every nation. Hence the globe was divided into 60 degrees, which, multiplied by 60,
became 3,600, the “great year.”Hence also the hour with its 60 minutes of 60 seconds each. The Asiatic people count a cycle of 60 years also, after which comes the lucky seventh decad, and the Chinese have their small cycle of 60 days,the Jews of 6 days, the Greeks 6 centuries — the Naros again. The Babylonians had a great year of 3,600,being the Naros multiplied by 6.The Tatar cycle called Van was 180 years, or three sixties; this multiplied by 12 times 12=144, makes 25,920 years, the exact period of revolution of the heavens.India is the birthplace of arithmetic and mathematics; as “Our Figures,” in Chips
from a German Workshop, Vol.II,by Prof. MaxMüller, shows beyond a doubt.
The cycle of 6 (666-Bible,6666-Rg veda) was devised from
the cakra (sa/a-1-god,kara-v-5;the hand of god!)/shadka
base.Sagara(samudra;sa-agra→end) is pralaya. 6,666 cakra being shadka/Sakra(Indra,king) 6666 martas/dharmas/Indras died in the Dasarajna war.6666/365.25=18.25.The Mahabharata kurukshetra war was finished in 18 days! 6+6+6+6 =24 horas is the time lapse from one udaya to the next udaya(yudha/yudhi-war).Each hora is a suura(warrior).
Suurasena/Pancala is the day.Its southern half is ruled by
Drupada(Vishnu) and the northern half is ruled by DroNa(mRta/north/Dharma).

gazelles(Rsya/eNa/vanastha/sarabha , ) and donkeys(garddabha/rasabha;naada/saalamRgas indicate Saalgraama/Pancaala);

culture of Anatolia and the Near East, the deceased were
deliberately exposed in order to be excarnated by vultures

other carrion birds. (The head of the deceased was sometimes removed and preserved — possibly a sign of ancestor worshipPancaala-pitR-patri) .This form of sky burial, is still practiced by Tibetan Buddhists and by Zoroastrians in Iran and India.Hence the Vedic –Pancala-Bharata-Anatolians built Gobekli Tepe.

Mrigasiirsha(animals) also mean the month of
Margasiirsha and Abhijit(tvisha/dvija) as the first star of the
vernal equinox when the vedic astrological observations
began around 20000 BCE(cf.Blavatsky on the secret
cycles-page11).There were three asterisms from
Muula(suura-the sun) to Abhijit/Satabhisha.
Hymn 5.3 of the Rigveda states: You at your birth
are Varuna(Solstice), O Agni. When you are kindled, you
are Mitra. In you, O son of strength, all gods are centered.
You are Indra to the mortal who brings oblation. You are
Aryaman, when you are regarded as having the mysterious
names of maidens, O Self-sustainer.
The number of nakshatras reflects the number of days in a sidereal month (modern value: 27.32 days), the width of a nakshatra traversed by the Moon in about one day. Each



nakshatra is further subdivided into four quarters (or padas). These play a role in popular Hindu astrology, where
each pada is associated with a syllable, conventionally
chosen as the first syllable of the given name of a child
born when the Moon was in the corresponding pada
The nakshatras of traditional bhartiya (Indian) astronomy are
based on a list of 28 asterisms found in
the Atharvaveda (AVŚ 19.7) and also in
the shatapadhaBrahmana (II.1.2). The first astronomical text that lists them is the Vedanga Jyotisha.
In classical Hindu scriptures (Mahabharata,Harivansa), the creation of the nakshatras is attributed to Daksha. They are personified as daughters of the deity and as wives of Chandra, the Moon god, or alternatively the daughters of Kasyapa, the brother of Daksha.
Each of the nakshatras is governed as 'lord' by one of the nine graham in the following sequence: Ketu (South Lunar Node), Sukra (Venus), Surya (Sun), Chandra (Moon), Mangala (Mars), Rahu (North Lunar Node), Brihaspati (Jupiter), Sani (Saturn) and Budha (Mercury). This cycle repeats itself three times to cover all 27 nakshatras. The lord of each nakshatra determines the planetary period known as the dasa, which is considered of major importance in forecasting the life path of the individual in Hindu astrology.
In Vedic Sanskrit, the term nákṣatra may refer to any heavenly
body, or to "the stars" collectively. The classical concept of a
"lunar mansion" is first found in the Atharvaveda, and becomes the primary meaning of the term in Classical Sanskrit.
Interestingly enough, the term "nakshatra" has a different meaning as demonstrated in the Surya Siddhanta, which is an ancient text on astronomy. In the early chapters, the author Mayasura or Mayan, describes various time units. He writes that a "prana" is a duration of 4 seconds. He then continues with a discussion of a number of time units with progressively



long durations made up of the shorter time units all composed of a number of pranas. Amongst those time units are something he calls "nakshatra". For example: 15 pranas are in a minute;
900 pranas in an hour; 21600 pranas in a day; 583,200 pranas in a nakshatra (month). According to Mayan, a nakshatra is a time unit with a duration of 27 days.
In Hindu astronomy, there was an older tradition of 28 Nakshatras which were used as celestial markers in the heavens. When these were mapped into equal divisions of the ecliptic, a division of 27 portions was adopted since that resulted in a cleaner definition of each portion (i.e. segment)
subtending 13° 20' (as opposed to 12° 51 3/7’ in the case of 28 segments). In the process, the Nakshatra Abhijit was left out without a portion. The Surya Siddhantha concisely specifies the coordinates of the twenty seven Nakshatras
The following list of nakshatras gives the corresponding regions of sky, following Basham.

the patriarchs of Judaism were buried in caves,Christ was

their lower half.Loincloths(ankika-dress,anki-agni-fire;patrabhadra-bharata-vastra-ushtra; netra-Indra;cela-siira-salasalagrama-Pancala) are shown on some pillars. The horizontal stone slab on the top is similar to a human head(sira/sila/surasun,scholar;ud-sila/ashTi/yashti;usra-uttarauttarayana;vasishta). Whether they were intended to denote surrogate worshippers, venerated ancestors(pitRs/gods), or supernatural anthropomorphic beings is not known(Bhadrapareta-preta-praata-bharata-dawn,agni).
A sort of a totem pole from Göbekli Tepe, Layer II, 8800-8000 BC - Şanlıurfa (Urfa) Museum
The site belongs to the earliest Neolithic (PPNA), but no traces of domesticated plants or animals have been found. The inhabitants are assumed to have been hunters and gatherers who lived in villages for at least part of the year. The elevated location may have served as a ritual center by 11,000 BCE or even earlier, towards the end of the Pleistocene.
Around the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE Göbekli Tepe lost its importance. Schmidt considered Göbekli Tepe a central location for a cult of the dead and that the carved animals
are there to protect the dead. He
assumed shamanic practices at the centre and suggested that



the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors.
In 2017, discovery of human crania with incisions were reported, interpreted as providing evidence for a new form of
Neolithic skull cult(cf.Golgotha-place of the
skull,Matthew.27.33),like the kapalins (a sect of saivites.
Brahma asked Siva to become a wandering ascetic and beg for food in a skull. Thus Siva became Kapalin and his
worshippers do the same.Ka-p-ala(kaala/kaahala) , ,

The imposing stratigraphy of Göbekli Tepe attests to many
centuries of activity, beginning as early as
the Epipaleolithic period. Structures identified with the succeeding period (PPNA), have been dated to the 10th



millennium BCE. Remains of smaller buildings identified as Pre-Pottery Neolithic B(PPNB) and dating from the 9th millennium BCE have also been unearthed.

Part of the excavated site
Dholavira (DroNa-pura/Indraprastha/suurapura;suura =

) in Bha -chau Taluk of Kutch District,near Radhan(Indra/DroNa)-pur in the state of Gujarat . It is also
known asKotada(Shadka/Cakra/Daksha/Taksha/KoTara
Indra/Durga/Kosala/kutara/fort) timba(sibira-fort/panca/
vasna/ Vishnu/stamba cf.Takshasila-Sikshasala,DroNa/
Bharadvaja was teacher of the Kurus). It is one of the five
largest Harappan sites and most prominent archaeological
sites in India belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization. It is also



considered as having been the grandest of cities of its
time(Indraprastha was said to be more grandiose than
Hastinapura) .The site was occupied from c.2650 BCE, but declined slowly after about 2100 BCE. It was briefly abandoned (Yajnasaala/Yajnasena change) and then reoccupied until c.1450 BCE.
Estimated to be older than the port-city of Lothal,the city of
Dholavira has a rectangular(catura/satra) shape and
organization. The acropolis and the middle town(Madhyama/Brahmasthana) had been furnished with their own defence-work, gateways, built-up areas, street system, wells, and large open spaces. The towering "castle" is defended by double ramparts. Next to this stands a place called the 'bailey' where important officials lived. The most striking feature of
the city is that all of its buildings, at least in their present
state of preservation, are built of stone(sila/jina), whereas
most other Harappan sites, including Harappa itself and Mohenjo-daro, are almost exclusively built of brick. A huge
circular , structure on the site is believed to be a
grave or memorial, although it contained no skeletons or
other human remains. The structure consists of ten radial
mud-brick walls(cf.the ten pillars of Gobekli Tepe;the Ten
commandments;Dasaraja;ten mudras of the board
) built in the shape of a spoked wheel. A soft sandstone sculpture of a male with phallus erectus but head
and feet below ankle truncated was found in the passageway



of the eastern gate(cf.Gobekli Tepe -DroNa/Indra is
Bhardvaaja). Many funerary structures(mound of the
dead;cita-city-funeral pyre→mound of the
dead→Pancala→Yajnasena→nagara→nakshatra →city) have been found.
Seven hemispherical constructions (cf.Gobekli Tepe
) were found at Dholavira(saptasva/divasa/ sapta/ tapasa-sun), of which two were excavated in detail, which were
constructed over large rock cut chambers. Having a circular
plan, these were big hemispherical elevated mud brick constructions. One of the excavated structures was designed in
the form of a spoked wheel(Pancala/Daksha/dasa/bharata).
The other was also designed in same fashion, but as a wheel
without spokes . Although they contained burial goods of pottery, no skeletons were found except for one grave, where a skeleton and a copper mirror were found. These hemispherical structures bear similarity to early Buddhist
stupas/viharas(with mortal remains of Buddha to make
mArtANDa/Pancala). The Archaeological Survey of India, which conducted the excavation, hinted that the design of the
spoked wheel and unspoked wheel(Ring is king/agni/full/bull/ra/sa/aja/raja/aksha/akshara/daksha/
namaa/bhadra/bharata/laksha/lakshmana/cakra/sekhara/Sa kra/Indra/mitra/droNa/mudra-round seal etc.) also remind one of the Sararata-chakra-citi and Sapradhi-rata-chakra-citi



mentioned in the Satapatha Brahmana and Sulba
sutras.Ratha yatras were temple
festivals designed to take the god(king,eponym) around
the city which he represented(cf. Jagannath, Balabhadra,
Subhadra and Sudarshana on the ratha of Puri-pura-sura
sun,scholar,brahamana).
One seated male figure made of stone(cf.Stone pillars of
Gobekli Tepe;Priest king of Mohenjodaro) has been found,
similar to two stone sculptures found at Harappa. Phallus-like
symbols of stone(Martanda/Pancala/pitR , cf.Gobekli) also found.
It is suggested that a coastal route existed linking Lothal and
Dholavira to Sutkagan Dor on the Makran coast.The link probably extended to Ancient Anatolia as similar people like the Greeks/Romans had contacts with India till the first centuries of the Christian era and the invasions of the Turks in the 11th-12th Centuries and the establishment of Turkish rule in India.

Scorpion King
Scorpion II (Ancient Egyptian: possibly Selk or Weha), or King Scorpion, refers to the second of two kings or chieftains of that name during the Protodynastic Period of UpperEgypt.

King Scorpion's name and title are of great dispute in modern Egyptology. His name is often introduced by a six- or seven
leafed, golden rosette or flower(cf.Kunda-flower for DroNa
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orna115-Rosetten.png; basileus, "king";padma-lotus,padmanabha-vishnu etc.)sign. This emblem can be found on numerous objects from



dynasty 0 and dynasty 1; it vanishes until the end of the 3rd dynasty, when it re-appears under high-ranked
officials, such as Khabawsokar and A'a-akhty (both dated
to the end of 3rd dynasty). Its precise meaning has been intensely discussed; the most common interpretation is that of an emblem meaning 'nomarch' or 'high
lord(soma/moksha/somaka/DroNa'. During the protodynastic
and early dynastic eras, it was evidently used as a designation for kings(kunda-Vishnu/pitR/paNa/Neb/ bhaama;pa-5,Na/making makes the kunda/panca/vishnu flower); in much later periods, it was bestowed on high-ranked officials and princes, especially on those who served as priests for the goddess Seshat(cf.Daksha/ Dakshina/Sastha). Thus, the golden rosette became an official emblem of Seshat. Most
linguists and Egyptologists read it Neb (for 'lord') or Nesw (for 'king'), and they are convinced that the golden rosette was
some kind of forerunner to the later serekh(cakra
/Sakra/sukra , , , , )
Since it is unclear what actual meaning was reserved for
the serekh animal of Scorpion II, scholars usually refer to him as 'King Scorpion II'.The tail of the scorpion is
vaara/bhaara(Vishnu,lion,tola -weight;cf.dol∏/dhola/ DroNa

Historical figure
Several Egyptologists consider Scorpion as the same person as Narmer .They say that the artistic style seen on the macehead of Scorpion II shows conspicuous similarities to that on the famous Narmer macehead. At the time of Scorpion II, Egypt was divided into several minor kingdoms that were fighting each other. It is conjectured that Narmer simply conquered the realms of Ka and Scorpion II, thus unifying the whole of Egypt for the first time.

A serekh(sikhara-sukra-taala-saala-siira-suura-garja-garta

of heraldic crest used in ancient Egypt.
A serekh(cakra/kiriiTa/garta/siirsha/harta) is a royal crest of
the Eguptian Pharaoh. Its use could be seen early as the Gerze(serekh) culture (ca. 3400 BC.). The hieroglyphs
forming the king's name were placed in a rectangular box(
sala,cf. , ) atop the serekh(cf. ) , which
represented the royal courtyard(pancala). The falcon



(garuda-Horus- ) of the god Horus, or the Set
(sesha/desa/dasa) animal, topped the serekh, showing the celestial patron of the named king.

Atum



https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/ 1b/Atum.svg/220px-Atum.svg.png
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atum
Atum (cf.Ved.atma-sun,soul,self;Bibl.Adam) or Atem or Tem, is an important deity in Egyptian mythology.
His wife Iusaas (Ved.ushas-dawn) is a primal goddess in Ancient Egyptian religion. She is called as "the grandmother of
all of the deities". Usha(Aja/iisa) is the mother/grandmother of the sun gods.
In the Heliopolitan creation myth, Atum was considered to be the first god, having created himself, sitting on a mound (benben;mound/tree or identified with the mound itself-agasun,hill,tree,snake;akasa-sky→aga-asa/seat;svar-sky,sun), from the primordial waters (Nu). Early myths state
that Atum created the god Shu and goddess Tefnut by



spitting them out of his mouth.The Brahmins too are considered
to be born from the mouth/face(mukha→sukha) of Brahma as per the Purusha sukta in RV.10.
atma(sun,soul,self)→Atum→damana(Vishnu/Bharata)→
tan-aya(putra-son)→sol→soul.
Some historians claim that the ancient Egyptian society was a "death cult" because of its elaborate tombs and mummification rituals.Even if predynastic Egypt anthropomorphic figures denoting pitR/bharata/Vishnu/Narayana/niryana were kept in the graves to protect the deceased.PitR protect their children.
Vishnu gives light and heat and remove obstacles.PitR worship
is the result of the child in the human mind.PitR/narayana is Vishnu.
Tombs were houses in the afterlife and so they were carefully constructed and decorated, just as homes for the living were. Mummification was a way to preserve the corpse so the ka
(soul; ) of the deceased could return to receive offerings of the things s/he enjoyed while alive. If mummification was not
affordable, a "ka-statue" in the likeness of the deceased was
carved for this purpose(cf.Gobekli Tepe pillars). The
Blessed Dead were collectively called the akhu, or "shining ones" (singular: akh cf.kha-sun,sky;aga-sun). They were
described as "shining as gold in the belly of Nut" (soma-sky). One of the earliest religious texts discovered, is the Papyrus of
Ani which is also called The Book of the Dead,shows the
mound of the dead principle guiding the Egyptian religion
as else where.The Pyramid Texts were actually written as
guides to help the deceased successfully become akh(aga
sol-soul) navigating through the duat(dosha-night).
Those who became lost in the duat became the unfortunate and sometimes dangerous mutu, the Restless Dead.Some ka
were eaten by Ammit(croc .See the fish flowing in the



river with Enki.The fish is ka-soul → → .Ammit is atma-sun,soul.Nakra-croc is naraka-underworld,nagara-city
necropolis,mahira-sun). Besides being eaten by Ammit, the worst fate a ka could suffer after physical death was to be forgotten. For this reason, ancestor veneration in ancient Egypt was an important rite of remembrance in order to
keep the ka "alive" in this life as well as in the next. Royals,
nobles and the wealthy made contracts with their local priests to perform prayers and give offerings at their tombs. Some tomb inscriptions even invited passers-by to speak aloud the names of the deceased within (which also helped to perpetuate their memory), and to offer water, prayers or other things if they so desired. In the private homes of the less wealthy, niches were carved into the walls for the purpose of housing images of
familial akhu and to serve as altars of veneration.

Çatalhöyük
Çatalhöyük at the time of the first excavations
Location: Küçükköy, Konya Province, Turkey
Founded: Approximately 7500 BC
Abandoned: Approximately 5700 BC



Periods: Neolithic to Chalcolithic

The eastern settlement forms a mound which would have risen about 20 m (66 ft) above the plain at the time of the latest Neolithic occupation. The prehistoric mound settlements were abandoned before the Bronze Age. A channel of the Çarşamba River(Sarasamba/Sarasvati) once flowed between the two mounds, and the settlement was built on alluvial clay which may have been favourable for early agriculture.
A striking feature of Çatalhöyük are its female figurines. Mellaart, the original excavator, argued that these well-formed, carefully made figurines, carved and molded from marble, blue and brown limestone, schist, calcite, basalt, alabaster, and clay, represented a female deity. Although a male deity existed as well, "statues of a female deity far outnumber those of the male deity, who moreover, does not appear to be represented at all after Level VI". To date, eighteen levels have been identified.



These artfully-hewn figurines were found primarily in areas Mellaart believed to be shrines. The stately goddess seated on a throne flanked by two female lions (illustration) was found in a grain bin, which Mellaart suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply. In later cultures, similar depictions are seen of Cybele, a mountain goddess.
Mother gives milk.Sun gives milk(light).River /sky gives water.

Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)
The Al-Masalla obelisk, the largest surviving monument from Heliopolis
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Ob elisk-SesostrisI-Heliopolis.JPG/200px-Obelisk-SesostrisIHeliopolis.JPG
Compare the obelisk with the stone pillars of Gobekli Tepe,the Stone Henge of England etc.
Heliopolis(Helio-sun,nagara-city,naga/mahira
sun;cf.Mehrgarh) was a major city of ancient Egypt.It was one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt, occupied since the Predynastic Period. It was the capital of the 13th or Heliopolite Nome of Lower Egypt and a major religious center. It is now located in Ayn Shams, a northeastern suburb of Cairo.
The major surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the obelisk of the
Temple of Ra-Atum erected by Senusret I of Dynasty XII. The 21 m (69 ft) high red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons (240,000 lbs).Compare with the Gobakli Tepe/Stone henge



pillars denoting the sun/jina(heli/Helios) by sila.
Heliopolis is the latinized form of the Ptolemaic
Greek name Hēlioúpolis -Ἡλιούπολις cf. Hastinapura-Indra/Indu-ra/sindura-bindu-vishnu-prastha, meaning "City of the Sun". Helios, the personified and deified form of the sun, was identified by the Greeks with the native Egyptian gods Ra and Atum, whose principal cult was located in the city.
Its native name was I
͗
wnw ("The Pillars-pitRs ,
"cf.paNa/bhavana/ bhanu/ sthaNu-sun,god,pillar,cf.Gobekli Tepe), whose exact pronunciation is uncertain because ancient Egyptian recorded only consonantal values. Its
traditional Egyptological transcription is Iunu but it appears
in biblical Hebrew as Ôn ( אן ) and Āwen ( און ), leading some scholars to reconstruct its pronunciation as *Āwanu. Variant
transcriptions include Awnu and Annu(cf.Anna-sun/Anno
year).
The city also appears in the Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts as the "House of Ra(cf.ra-agni;ra-vi→sun)".
It was principally notable as the cult center of the sun god Atum(atma/asma(raja-sma/harit-asma/haritasva/shaman)/jina/sila/sma/bhasma/soma/sthanu-siva,pillar), who came to be identified with Ra and then Horus. The primary temple of the city was known as the Great House (Ancient Egyptian: Pr Ꜥ ꜣ t or Per Aat, *Par ʻĀʼat cf.pra-stha/pra
asaada) or House of Atum (Pr I
͗
tmw or Per Atum, *Par
ʼAtāma; Hebrew: פתם , Pithom). Its priests maintained that Atum or Ra was the first being, rising self-created from the primeval waters. A decline in the importance of Ra's cult during Dynasty V led to the development of the Ennead, a grouping of nine major Egyptian gods which placed the others in subordinate status to Ra–Atum. The high priests of Ra are not as well documented as those of other deities, although the high priests of Dynasty VI (c. 2345 – c. 2181 BC) have been discovered and



excavated. During the Amarna Period of Dynasty XVIII, Pharaoh Akhenaten introduced a kind of monotheistic worship of Aten, the deified solar disc. As part of his construction projects, he built a Heliopolitan temple named
"Elevating Aten" (Wṯs I͗ tn or Wetjes Atum), whose stones can still be seen in some of the gates of Cairo's medieval city wall. The cult of the Mnevis(ma-Vishnu) bull, another embodiment of the Sun, had its altar here as well. Their personal formal
burial ground was situated north(DroNa) of the city.

Stonehenge
The Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England, consisting of a ring of standing stones, with each standing stone around 13 feet high, 7 feet wide and weighing around 25 tons(cf.Gobekli Tepe). The stones are set close to several hundred burial mounds making it a mound of the dead/mArtANDa/Narayana/niryana/nirvana site.
Archeologists believe it was constructed from 3100 BC to 2000 BC. Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon. Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings. Deposits containing human bone date from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were first dug, and continued for at least another five hundred years.
The name Stonehenge is said to come from Old
English words stān (cf.sthaNu-Siva,pillar,spear,permanent
, ;sadana-satra-house,carama-death,Dolmen etc.Stambha is pillar;skambha is god.The Harappan/Christian

or hen(c)en meaning "hang" or "gallows" or "instrument of torture" etc.But consider Pancaala/savana/japana may also be

Beersheba (Parvata/prabhata/Vrishabha/Mount Sinai).For the Hebrews it is well of the oath, or well of seven, a well dug by
Abraham, and so named because he and Abi(avi/ravi ) melech here entered into a compact ( Genesis 21:31 ). On reopening it, Isaac(Visakha/Kasi) gave it the same name (



Genesis 26:31-33 ). It was a favourite place of abode of both of these patriarchs ( Genesis 21:33-22:1 Genesis ).
Beersheba, also spelled Beer-Sheva, is the largest city in the Negev desert of southern Israel. It is also called the "Capital of the Negev". Beersheba is iisaana(iisa-ayana;northeast; miina;angle of siva/sava/ zava/tapa/ japa/sabha/diva)/ prabhata(dawn)/parvata(hill,udayagiri-hill of sunrise,udayasriirising sun)/vrishabha/viirabhadra/paanapatra/waterjar.Brahmins begin their japa/sava in the early morning when the sun is in

Mohenjo-daro
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro
. Mohenjo-daro (Sindhi for Mound of the Dead
Men;Narayana/niryana/naara-yaana); is an archaeological
site in the province of Sindh,Pakistan. Built around 2500 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley civilization, and one of the world's earliest major cities,



contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, ,Mesopotamia,Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined.
It is a mount of the dead site.
Mohenjo-daro, the modern name for the site, has been
variously interpreted as "Mound of the Dead Men" in Sindhi,
and as "Mound of Mohan" (where Mohan is Krishna or Sohan). Mohenjo-daro may have been a point of diffusion for the eventual worldwide domestication of chickens.

The ancient site at Kot Diji was the forerunner of the Indus Civilisation. The occupation of this site is attested



already at 3300 BCE. The remains consist of two parts; the citadel area on high ground (about 12 m), and outer area. The Pakistan Department of Archaeology excavated at Kot Diji in 1955 and 1957.
Kot Diji Fort, means "Fort of the Daughter".Bhadra(Durga/Menaka/Draupati/Parvati-grija)
is fort. Located in the province of Sindh,at the foot of the Rohri (putri-girija-daughter)Hills Pakistan, it is on the east bank of the Indus opposite Mohenjo-daro.
Early Harappan towns (4000–3000 BCE)
The development of the farming communities in different parts of Baluchistan and Lower Sindh later led to urbanization. The
earliest fortified town to date found is at Rehman Dheri, dated 4000 BCE in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa close to River Zhob Valley. Other fortified towns found to date are at
Amri(3600–3300 BCEcf. amri-vana-paNa) and Kot Diji in Sindh and at Kalibangan (3000 BCE.cf. Go-bekli→kalibangan→Kot-diji) in India at the Hakra River.
Kot Diji culture (3300–2600 BCE)
The site covers 2.6 ha. The earliest occupation of this site is termed 'Kot Dijian', which is early formative Harappan.
At the earliest layer, Kot Diji I (2605 BC), copper and bronze were not used. The houses and fortifications were made from unbaked mud-bricks. Later, bronze was used, but only for personal ornaments. Also, use of the potters wheel was already in evidence.
The Early Harappan phase construction consists of two clearly
defined areas. There is a citadel on high ground for the



elites separated by a defensive wall with bastions at regular intervals. This area measures about 500 ft x 350 ft. The Outer area, or the city proper, consisted of houses of mud bricks on
stone foundations.
Pottery found from this site has designs with horizontal and
wavy lines, or loops and simple triangular patterns. Other
objects found are pots, pans, storage jars, toy carts, balls, bangles, beads, terracotta figurines of mother goddess and animals, bronze arrowheads, and well-fashioned stone
implements. A particularly interesting find at Kot Diji is a toy
cart, which shows that the potter’s wheel permitted the use
of wheels for bullock carts.
Early Indus script may have appeared at Kot Diji on pottery
and on a sealing. The use of inscribed seals and the standardization of weights may have occurred during the Kot Diji period.
Late Kot-Diji type pots were found as far as Burzahom in Jammu and Kashmir.
Massive burning
There are obvious signs of massive burning of over the entire site, including both the lower habitation area and the high mound (the fortified town), which were also observed at other Early Harappan sites: Period III at Gumla, Period II
at Amri, Period ID at Nausharo. Some of the meanings of the
vedic term Bharata is fire,actor,priest,king etc. The priests are actors in the sacrificial stage or Yajnasaala.Pancala is Yajnasena/Yajanadhaana/agnadhaana.At the end of a sacrifice the paNa-saala is given to agni/the saala is burned down.Rajadhaanas are considered as Yajanasaalas that are to be burned down.Hence the burning and rebuilding.

Lothal is one of the southernmost cities of the ancient Indus valley civilisation, located in the Bhaal(bhaara-Vishnu,palaking;viira-agni,vaara-tail) region of the modern state of Gujarat(kusa-raja;kusa-water,house) and first inhabited c. 3700 BCE,on the mouth of the Sarasvati(Indus.Indus had since then shifted westward due to earth quakes but now has again started to shift to the east-to the Indian side). It was discovered in 1954, and was excavated from 13 February 1955 to 19 May 1960 by the ASI. According
to the ASI, Lothal had the world's earliest known dock.



Lu/R-sthala/saya.Lu-gal /netra/mitra/Indra/DroNa/Rudra.
Lothal was a thriving trade centre in ancient times, with its trade of beads,gems and valuable ornaments reaching the far corners of West Asia and Africa. The techniques and tools they pioneered for bead-making and in metallurgy have stood the test of time for over 4000 years.
Lo(La-Indra)-thal , /Ratha-aala/DroNa/Indrais situated near the village of Saragwala (Egy.Serekh/Cakra/Sakra/

district near Bhavnagar(Bhaga nagar), Rajkot and Dholaka
(cf.Dholavira→Lothal pura→nutana-new Pura). The nearest
cities are Dholka and Bagodara (bhaga/paNa/vrika/siira/suura/saala/taala/dhaana/naatha/maas
a/mesha/medha ) . Resuming excavation in 1961, archaeologists unearthed trenches sunk on the northern, eastern and western flanks of the mound, bringing to light the
inlet channels and nullah ("ravine", or "gully") connecting the
dock with the river. The findings consist of a mound, a township, a marketplace, and the dock.
The meaning of Lothal (a combination of Loth and (s) thal) in Gujarati to be "the mound of the dead" is not unusual, as
the name of the city of Mohenjo-daro in Sindhi means the
same. People in villages neighbouring to Lothal had known of
the presence of an ancient town and human remains. As
recently as 1850, boats could sail up to the mound. In 1942,
timber was shipped from Broach to Saragwala via the
mound.



Speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city,
Lothal(sthala/sadana/satra;moksha-ala;Mohen
satra;vrindavana;gokula;lu-gal) was not a large settlement at
all, and its "dock" was perhaps an irrigation tank. However, the ASI and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from Sindh to Saurashtra in Gujarat. Lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern India. It is essentially a single culture site—the Harappan culture in all its variances is evidenced. An indigenous micaceous Red Ware culture also existed, which is believed to be autochthonous and pre-Harappan. Two subperiods of Harappan culture are distinguished: the same period (between 2400 and 1900 BCE) is identical to the exuberant culture of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
The meaning of Lothal (a combination of Loth and (s) thal) in Gujarati to be "the mound of the
dead(mArtANDda/Narayana/niryana/nirvana/naara-yaana"
is not unusual, as the name of the city of Mohenjo
daro in Sindhi means the same.Mounds of the dead.Stone

bhadra/Bharata/Peter.
Lothal artists introduced a new form of realistic painting. Paintings depict animals in their natural surroundings. On one large vessel, the artist depicts birds(khaga/
paNa/sura/jina) with fish(saala/dhaana) in their beaks,
resting in a tree(paNa/vana/druma/droNa/Indra), while a foxlike animal(saalamriga) stands below. This scene bears resemblance to the story of The fox and the crow in the Panchatantra. On a miniature jar, the story of the thirsty crow and deer is depicted – of how the deer could not drink



from the narrow-mouth of the jar, while the crow succeeded by dropping stones in the jar. A complete set of terra-cotta gamesmen, has been found in Lothal—animal figures, pyramids with ivory handles and castle-like objects (similar to
the chess set of Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt;cf.Scorpion king). The bust of a male with slit eyes, sharp nose and square-cut beard is reminiscent of Sumerian figures, especially
stone sculptures from Mari(Lothal is Lu-gal/Narmer.Animal
figures with wheels and a movable head may have been utilised as toys or ratha in sacrifices.
A massive flood (c. 1900 BCE cf.flood of Dvaraka) completely
destroyed the flagging township in a single stroke.
Archaeological analysis shows that the basin and dock were sealed with silt and debris, and the buildings razed to the ground. The flood affected the entire region of Saurashtra, Sindh and south Gujarat, and affected the upper reaches of the Indus and Sutlej, where scores of villages and townships were washed away. The population fled to inner regions.

Religion and disposal of the dead

ramayana;cf.Catalhoyuk twin goddess , , , ,
, , , , .Twin burial ensured the
pitR/Vishnu/putra/bharata/pareta/praata worship/Drupada
vandana possible.
The people of Lothal worshipped a fire god, speculated to be
the horned deity depicted on seals, which is also evidenced
by the presence of private and public fire-altars where
religious ceremonies were apparently conducted. Archaeologists have discovered gold pendants, charred ashes
of terra-cotta cakes and pottery, bovine remains, beads and
other signs that may indicate the practice of the Gavamayana sacrifice/Narayana bali, associated with the ancient Vedic religion. Animal worship is also evidenced, but not the worship of the Mother Goddess that is evidenced in other Harappan cities—experts consider this a sign of the existence of diversity in religious traditions. However, it is believed that a sea
goddess, perhaps cognate with the general Indus-era Mother Goddess, was worshipped. Today, the local villagers likewise worship a sea goddess, Vanuvati Sikotarimata, suggesting a connection with the ancient port's traditions and historical past
as an access to the sea. But the archaeologists also
discovered that the practice had been given up by
2000 BCE (determined by the difference in burial times of the
carbon-dated remains). It is suggested that the practice
occurred only on occasion. It is also considered that given
the small number of graves discovered—only 17 in an estimated population of 15,000—the citizens of Lothal also practised cremation of the dead. Post-cremation burials



have been noted in other Indus sites like Harappa, Mehi and Damb-Bhuti.

Mastaba→ , matsa(fish)bha→somaka→moksha;praata/prabhaata/pareta/preta/dead.
This shows worship of dawn or suuryanamaskaara.It is a mound of the dead/Narayana/niryana/mArtANDa. Mastaba is the Arabic word for "stone bench(cf.Gobekli Tepe,Stone henge)".,
Example of a mastaba
A mastaba or pr-djt (meaning "house for eternity" or "eternal house" in Ancient Egyptian;cf prastha/praasaada like
Indraprastha) is a type of ancient Egyptian tomb (mound of
the dead) in the form of a flat-roofed, rectangular structure with inward sloping sides, constructed out of mud-bricks (from the Nile River). These edifices were used for the burial of many eminent Egyptians during Egypt's Early Dynastic Period and Old Kingdom. In the Old Kingdom epoch, local
kings began to be buried in pyramids instead of in
mastabas, although non-royal use of mastabas continued for over a thousand years. Egyptologists call these tombs mastaba, which is the



Pyramid

The word 'pyramid' comes from the Greek word 'pyramis' which means 'wheat cake' from the pointy-topped cake shape of the Pyramid. The ancient Egyptian word for the pyramids was mR/'Mer'(nR-king/mR-death)/pimar/pR (pura-house)/pira(pyre/cita/citi/city)/pramiita(dead).
It is the mount of the dead/mArtANDa/Narayana/niryana.It is
Sinai,Golgotha,Mohenjodaro,Lothal etc.
Pyramids have been built by civilizations in many parts of the world for pitR/Vishnu worship. The largest pyramid by volume is the Great Pyramid of Cholula, in the Mexican state of Puebla. For thousands of years, the largest manmade structures on Earth were pyramids—first the Red Pyramid in the Dashur Necropolis and then the Great Pyramid of Khufu(tallest pyramind), both in Egypt.



The Mesopotamians built the earliest pyramidal structures,
called zig(kesa/ka)-gurats(garta/garuda). In ancient times,
these were brightly painted in gold/bronze. Hence vedic

The Enigma Of Indraprastha
Indraprastha ("Plain of Indra/Maghavan" or "City of Indra") is mentioned in the Mahabharata as a city of the Kuru Kingdom. It was the home/capital of the kingdom led by the Pandavas. The The location of Indraprastha is uncertain but Purana Qila in present-day New Delhi is frequently cited and has been noted as such in texts as old as the 14th-century CE. Under the Pali form of its name, Indapatta, it is also mentioned in Buddhist texts as the capital of the Kuru Mahajanapada. The city is sometimes also knownas Khandavaprastha(Pandava

the name of a forest(vana/paNa) region on the banks of the Yamuna(Kha/Kalinda/madhya-ma;hence khavasana/panca/bhasma/ Vishnu-prastha) river which (according to the Mahabharata) had been cleared to build the city.

The term Pura occurs approx. 30 times in the Rigveda. It is often translated as city,castle,or fortress.



In the Rig veda, there are also puras made of metal (purās ayasīs in 10.101.8). In Aitareya Brahamana, there is copper/bronze, silver, and golden pur.All these indicate
the painted palaces or the sun in different times of the day.

Mount Sinai
Sinai is jina/sila/miina indicating dawn/praata/pareta/pitR.
It is from Miina/Sinai that Judea((surya/udaya)/ Israel/Indran/usra-el is born.Moses(Heb.moza-sunrise) met
god mount Sinai along with his brother Aaron (Aruna/arunodaya).Aaron built the golden calf which is the
golden rising sun .The adityas(arka→12→dvadasa→Divodasa) being 12,Pisces being the twelfth sign,Israel has twelve tribes(varga-tribe,arka-sun).It being praata/prabhata/ Vrishabha/ viirabhadra /mArtANDa/Narayana/mritaasana/asma/sma/aNDa/bha-sma it lead
to the death of 3000(srii/tri/3/ ) men of Israel(cf.6666 men dying in the Dasarajna).This made mount Sinai a mound of the dead.Silaptra/jinapitR/Bharadvaaja was made by the two
stone slabs of ten commandments of the god who
wrote(Thut/Thot;Ved.Toda).On Mount Golgotha,this role was taken up by the INRI inscription.On mount Sinai,the Narayana(king god-writer) is Egyptian. On Mount Golgotha,the god who wrote through Pilate(the Roman governor) is obviously Roman.
Exodus 32:28
27He said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Every man of you put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his
neighbor.'" 28 So the sons of Levi did as Moses
instructed, and about three thousand men of the
people fell that day.29Then Moses said, "Dedicate yourselves today to the LORD-- for every man has been against his son and against his brother-- in order that He may bestow a
blessing upon you today." Three thousand pillars are three∏

mahishi(principal queen) with bhadra(bull) or bharata or
pareta (mahisha-anointed king,mahishi-king’s

Mount Olympus
Mount Olym-pus(nabhas/aruNa/varuNa/nripa/Narayana

God of the sky, lightning, thunder, law, order, and justice.He is Jupiter/Iisa/Siva/Soma/Rudra.His seat is the preta/sava/zava/ praata mountain/Sinai/Miina itself.His abode is mount Olympus.
His symbols are Thunderbolt(Vajra/Varsha), eagle(Garuda), bull(R-shabha/Beersheeba/praata), and oak(vana/paNa). His consort is Hera(arka/hara/kaala).
Zeus
Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Indra,Jupiter, Perkunas, Perun,Thor,Odin etc.



He was respected as the Father(The concept of "sky father" may also be taken to include Sun gods with similar characteristics. The concept is complementary to an "earth mother".
"Sky Father" is a direct translation of the Vedic Dyaus pita, etymologically descended from the same Proto-Indo-European deity name as the Greek Zeus Pater and Roman Jupiter, all of which are reflexes of the same Proto-Indo-European deity's name, *Dyēus Ph2tḗr (Pisces-northeast ruled by Jupiter gives birth to the sun/son gods).
(pitR/patri /Kasyapa/garuda/khaga) who was chief of the gods. "Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence." Zeus is the only deity in the Olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent Indo-European etymology. The earliest attested forms of the name are the Mycenaean
Greek , di-we and , di-wo, written in the Linear B syllabic script.

Mount Golgotha/Calvari
Calvary, or Golgotha was, according to the Gospels, a site immediately outside Jerusalem's walls where Jesus was crucified. Matthew's and Mark's gospels translate the term to
mean "place of skull" (Κρανίου Τόπος Kraníou Tópos-Gobekli Tepe), in Latin rendered Calvariæ Locus, from which the English word Calvary is derived.
The recorded form Γολγοθα is conjectured to be a simplified
pronunciation of an Aramaic golgolta, corresponding to Hebrew gulgōleṯ( גֻּלְ גֹּ לֶ ת ) "skull".
English Calvary is the anglicized form of the Latin gloss from
the Vulgate (Calvariæ), to refer to Golgotha in Luke 23:33, where the Greek text gives Κρανίον rather than the explicit Κρανίου Τόπος of Matthew and Mark. The church fathers offer different interpretations for the name associating it with the site where the skull of Adam was buried(Origenes) or from a topographic feature resembling a cranium ,or it being a place of execution where the skulls of the people remained.
While the Gospels merely identify Calvary as a "place"
(τόπος), Christian tradition has described the location as a "mountain" or "hill".
The location itself is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels. Matthew 27:33: "And when they were come unto a place
called Golgotha [Γολγοθᾶ], that is to say, a place of a skull [Κρανίου Τόπος]" (KJV)
Mark 15:22: "And they bring him unto the place Golgotha [Γολγοθᾶ], which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull [Κρανίου Τόπος]" (KJV)
Luke 23:33: "And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary [Κρανίον;kaala-varya/kaalindi;kaalapuri-south],



there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left." (KJV)
John 19:17: "And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull [Κρανίου Τόπον], which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha [Γολγοθα]." (KJV)
Where is Golgotha or Calvari? Why Latin writers had to translate a place name given in Greek? The answer lies in the statement of the god regarding where he is going and why he is going there as given in John 14:1-3.
1.Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe in Me as well. 2 In My Father’s house(cf. the Greek Zeus Pater and Roman Jupiter) are many rooms.If it were not so,would I have told you that I amgoing there to prepare a place for you? 3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am.
So Golgotha/Calvari is the Father’s house with many rooms.The Father is pitR/Bharata/Vishnu/Peter/priest.
It is devalaya/divalaya.Being svarga/Dvaraka it has many
dvaras/doors/rooms.This house has other names like
Vrindavana,Gokula,Kalapuri etc.The dead sarasvats/
brahamans are said to enter Vrindavana.
Now, Golgotha→Go-kula(akasa-sky)-asta(house)/
desa(place).Gokula is go(sky,sun,star)-kuTa(parvata-hill).
Hence there are seven kulaparvatas also.
It is the top of the head/top of the sky.It is here that
pitR/Vishnu/bha-sma , , , , , , ,



, , /bindu rests.It is the house of the heavenly
Father.It is from there that the first step of the cross begins.
Diva/dyu marks the day-pakal-kalpa-kapala-khapaala/ khandava/Somapa/somaka position of the sun.
South is considered as the direction of ma(king,water, Yama,Vishnu,brahama,siva)/Yama/Kaala.
It is kaalapuri (city of kaala-time;Vishnu,Narayana,niryana). Hence the dead are buried with their feet placed in South
making them Bhrigus,so that the souls destination north after death is ensured.In the northern Ayana(nri-ayana/Narayana) the head is up.In the southern Ayana the head is down(Peter).
Kalapuri→Calvari.Thus both are the same.It is the House of the Father/Pater/Bharata with many rooms and it has the shape of a skull/hill ! The dead Christ is mArtANDa/pitR/patri/ king(INRI)/Narayana sun.To make him mrita
Anda/atma(mArtANDa) , he is crucified
naked(nagna/agna/naaga/raja) .The living god is
Bharata/Peter/potR/hotR. The King’s seat is
soma(sky)/dom/tomb.King’s- dom is agnishtoma / nakshatra/Yajnasaala/Yajnasena/ Pancala/Somaka/ Rajadhaana etc.
The three crosses on Mount Calvari are the three points of the
trident/trisuula/naama .Srii is three.

Mount Golgotha owes its credits to Mount Olympus,the mount with the Mytikas( a nose, hence the mount is the head or skull/hill) peak where the Greek Gods reside (cf.Kailasa of Siva in the Himalayas).
The aim of the church fathers was to extend Pax
Romana(Caesar- Jesus-Zeus) to the ends of the world by founding a religion on Golgotha-the mound of the dead.
Rome as a world empire collapsed but Rome as the church
has become the eternal empire as told by Jesus to Pilate
“You are right in saying I am a king..My kingdom is not of this world...My kingdom is from another place...”
John.18.36-37.

Ancient Middle Eastern stone structures
revealed by Google Earth
In the 1920s, Royal Air Force pilots flying from Cairo to Baghdad noticed in the lava fields of Syria, eastern Jordan and Saudi Arabia thousands of elaborate stone wheels, measuring up to 70 metres wide and visible only from the sky.

Arka/bhadra/bharata/pitR/sila/jina.
The structures, included wheels, rings(kings, nri/mri,cashaala,Pancala cf.Dholavira), pendants and cairns.
Wheels(bhadra-praata-preta-pareta-pramiita-pyramid-dead) are large circular enclosures, with thick walls, and internal partitions of equal thickness that resemble the spokes of a wheel; while rings are small versions that can be internally divided or not.
Most numerous are the pendants, consisting of a head(bhadra) and a tail(vaara;bhadra has a vaara to indicate Pancala/viirabhadra, bhadraasana and paretaasana.cf.Lo51.Narayna is niryana.Mokshapravesa is
vrindavana pravesa at death , , L051a ).
In the Jeddah sample no kites(patra,pareta, Egyptian ka cf bhadra-patra-ka-K whence the unicorn bull and winged bulls is ka-sa,ksha-narasimha,gaja-elephant), which number in the hundreds in Jordan, were found.
No one knows what they were for. The kites' , ,

"There are three wheels(cf. ) at Wisad which are really bizarre.

Lothal/Lugal/dhola/loca/suura/suurasena/somaka/pancaala+viir a/pura →droNa/soma-pura=rajkuuTa=rajkoT=Rajkot is the centre of the Sau-rashtra region of Gujarat; Sau=Kau=Go/saura/suura-stara/staala/saala/sena
located on the banks of the Aji(Indra) and Nyari(ma-ayana) rivers.
Dvārakā
Dvaraka(Helioplois/svarga/moksha/divakara/dinakara/dingir/Oly mpus/Golgotha/dolmen),or Dvāravatī ("the gated city]", is the setting for many chapters in Harivamsa. The city is described as near the sea, in modern era Gujarat.Dvaraka along with Mathura,Ayodhya, Kasi,Kanchi,Avantika(Ujjain) and Puri form



the sapta Tirtha (pilgrimage;siirsha-rajadhaana) sites for spiritual liberation.
In the Mahabharata, it was also called Kusasthali(Gujarat;uksha/usha/aja-sthala), a fort of the Yadavas(Vasava/Udaya). This city is described as the capital of the Anarta(Amrita-sun-divakara-Dvaraka-sura-puramahira-nagara) Kingdom. According to the Harivansa the city
was located in the region of the Sindhu Kingdom(Mohenjodaro).
In the Mausala(samudra) Parva of the Mahabharata, Arjuna witnessed the submergence of Dvaraka in the sea.He saw the city becoming a mound of the dead.Pura is sura(sun).Nagara(city) is naga(sun,sky).The sea rushed into the city.In a matter of minutes there was no trace of the city.Dvaraka was just a name,just a memory. Everyday at sunset-Arjuna sees it-Samudra is Sindhu/Varuna/west/bindu/vishnu.Hence it is a naama.
The Mahabharata’s main esoteric solar worship themes
included in the historical anecdotes( as in the Bible also) are Krishna(srii/hari-jina;dhishana-intellect) becoming the king of Dwaraka(svarga-sky;divakara-sun;the king on the throne is the sun in the sky),DroNa(Bharadvaja/Pancala/mrita)’s elevation as the teacher of the Bharatas(Puru/Kuru),Drupada (prabhata/ tripat/ Vishnu/Pancala) bandhana(vandana),Krishna(Guru/Harijina)’s delivery of the Bhagavat giita in the Dharma(Indra)
kshetra(prastha/Dholavira)/ Pancala/Gandhara/Takshasila ,the Kurukshetra(gurukshetra-Miina)-yudha(war,udaya-rise) where Bhiimasena(Suurasena/Krishna) kills(hana-killer,nagasun,gama-going,gana-group) Duryodhana(suryodaya-sunrise)
and the destruction of Dwaraka by the sea(divakra disappearing in the west).A brahmana’s ritual life of
suryanamaskara to sandhyavandana is the guiding principle
enshrined in the Mahabharata.
