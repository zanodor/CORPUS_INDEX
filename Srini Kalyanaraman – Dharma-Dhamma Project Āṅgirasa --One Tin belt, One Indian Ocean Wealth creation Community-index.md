Dharma-Dhamma Project Āṅgirasa -- One Tin belt, One Indian Ocean Wealth creation Community
Dharma-Dhamma Project Āṅgirasa
Dharma-Dhamma Project Āṅgirasa is a tribute to the R̥ gveda R̥ ṣi who gave the vision of a Commonwealth of Nations governed by Śreṇi dharma-dhamma of shared wealth-creation for the benefit of humanity. Many R̥ ca-s of the R̥ gveda credit Angirasa as seers, mantra-draṣṭā.
Analogous to the Fabricius Google Arts & Culture Lab (in collaboration with Macquarie University, Sydney Australia; UBISOFT; psycle; and Akademie der wissenschaften, Berlin, Germany-- https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/fabricius/en/about -- the DharmaDhamma Project Āṅgirasa is a tribute to Āṅgirasa R̥ ṣi of R̥ gveda times who unleashed an industrial scale revolution in harnessing material resources for the benefit of humanity.
Dharma-Dhamma Project Āṅgirasa starts with the following initiatives:
1. To further archaeometallurgical, multi-disciplinary researches to identify the sources of Tin ore which led to the Bronze Age Revolution in Asia;
2. To document and disseminate though social media apps, to reach out to every mobile phone user of the globe, the hieroglyphs/hypertexts of Indus Script Corpora to firm up the reading of the ancient writing system and meanings of expressions related to industrial, organizational and technological advances;
3. To share experiences of the civilizational story, cultural advances made in the nations of Indian Ocean Rim;
4. To work with nations of Indian Ocean Rim to identify new areas for cooperation and shared wealth creation activities and increased employment opportunities of youth.
At least 2 millennia before the Silk Road, an Indian Ocean Community created the wealth of nations documented on over 8000 inscriptions of Indus Script Corpora.
To complement the One Belt One Road initiative of PRC, Bhāratam leads Dharma-Dhamma Project Āṅgirasa to promote accelerated shared economic development of Indian Ocean Community of Nations, re-living the six millennia-old Tin Route from Hanoi to Haifa. This is documented in Indus Script Cipher.

"Rennel made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches—Punarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatoya_River

Karatoyā (करतोया), called sadānīrā of Ṛgveda times takes Sarasvati Civilization contact area into Brahmaputra river valley. Thus the wealth of the nation during the Tin-Bronze revolution creating the richest nation on the globe is a pan-Bhāratīya phenomenon of ca. 4th millennium BCE.
Varāha-purāṇa
Karatoyā (करतोया).—Name of a river originating from Ṛkṣa, a holy mountain
(kulaparvata) in Bhārata, according to the Varāhapurāṇa chapter 85. There are settlements (janapada) where Āryas and Mlecchas dwell who drink water from these rivers.



11
Bhārata is a region south of Hemādri, once ruled over by Bharata (son of Ṛṣabha), whose ancestral lineage can be traced back to Svāyambhuva Manu, who was created by Brahmā, who was in turn created by Nārāyaṇa, the unknowable all-pervasive primordial being.
Puranic Encyclopedia
Karatoyā (करतोया).—A holy river. This river worships Varuṇa sitting in his court. (Śloka 22,
Chapter 9, Sabhā Parva). If one stays on the shores of this river and observes fasting for three days one would get the benefit of performing an Aśvamedha yāga. (Chapter 85, Vana Parva). Karatoyā (करतोया) refers to the name of a River or Tīrtha (pilgrim’s destination) mentioned in the Mahābhārata (cf. III.83.3, VI.10.34).
The Kavyamimamsa of Rajasekhara
Karatoyā (करतोया) is the name a locality mentioned in Rājaśekhara’s 10th-century
Kāvyamīmāṃsā.—A sacred river, which is flowing through the districts of Rangpur, Dinājpur and Bogrā in Bengal. It is joining the river Brahmaputra near the Gangetic delta. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.
Shabda-Sagara Sanskrit-English Dictionary
Karatoyā (करतोया).—f.(-yā) The Karatoya river, a river in the north-east of Bengal. E. kara the hand, and toya water: at the wedding of Siva and Parvati, the water which had been poured into the hand of the former, constituted, upon its being thrown on the ground, the source of this river. Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Karatoyā (करतोया):
[=kara-toyā] [from kara] f. Name of a river in the north-east of Bengal (said to have,
originated from the water poured into the hand of Śiva at his marriage with Pārvati, and thrown by him on the ground), [Mahābhārata; Viṣṇu-purāṇa]
The rivers which flow through the Pūrvadeśa are:
1. Śoṇa,
2. Lauhitya, 3. Gaṅgā, 4. Karatoyā and 5. Kapiśā
(Kāvyamīmāṃsā: Pp- 93 ‘śoṇalauhitya nadau | gaṅgākaratoyākapiśādyāśca nadyaḥ’ |)
I saw the following holy rivers:—Gaṅgā, Śatadrū, Yamunā, Kauśikī, Carmaṇvatī, Vetravatī,
Candrabhāgā, Sarasvatī, Vipāśā, Vitastā, Sindhu, Godāvarī,Vasvokasāra, Nalinī, Payoṣṇī, Na rmadā, Aparṇā, Tuṅgabhadrā, Karatoyā, Mahānadī, Suvarṇā, Kṛṣṇā, Śibirā the great river, Vaitaraṇī, Kāverī, Śoṇa, Bhīmarathī, Viśālā, Śiprā and Vetravatī. These and other rivers I saw while wandering through your belly entirely, the belly of a noble soul. I saw the sky beautified by the moon and sun. It was shining with its own refulgence similar to that of fire and sun. O boy, I saw the earth too, rendered splendid by the forests. There the brahmins performed various sacrifices. The Kṣatriyas were engaged in the activities of pleasing and humouring the people of all castes. The Vaiśyas performed the agricultural operations. O Puruṣottama, all these and many other things were seen.] (Source: Chapter 53

Vaisampayana said,—'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, the trio Krishna, Arjuna and Bhima, all possessed of great energy, set out for Magadha attired in the garb of Snataka Brahmanas of resplendent bodies, and blessed by the agreeable speeches of friends and relatives. Possessed of superior energy and of bodies already like the Sun, the Moon, and the Fire, inflamed with wrath at the sad lot of their relative kings, those bodies of theirs became much more blazing. And the people, beholding Krishna and Arjuna, both of whom had never before been vanquished in battle, with Bhima in the van, all ready to achieve the same task, regarded Jarasandha as already slain. For the illustrious pair (Krishna and Arjuna) were masters that directed every operation (in the universe), as also all acts relating to the morality, wealth, and pleasure of every being.
Having set out from the country of the Kurus, they passed through Kuru-jangala and arrived at the charming lake of lotuses. Passing over the hills of Kalakuta, they then went on crossing the Gandaki, the Sadanira (Karatoya), and the Sarkaravarta and the other rivers taking their rise in the same mountains.
They then crossed the delightful Sarayu and saw the country of Eastern Kosala. Passing over that country they went to Mithila and then crossing the Mala and Charamanvati, the three heroes crossed the Ganges and the Sone and went on towards the east. At last those heroes of unfaded glory arrived at Magadha in the heart of (the country of) Kushamva. Reaching then the hills of Goratha, they saw the city of Magadha that was always filled with kine and wealth and water and rendered handsome with the innumerable trees standing there.'"

Karatoya Mahatmya refers to the sacredness of this river. Rivers Kosi and Mahananda joined the Karatoya and "formed a sort of ethnic boundary between people living south of it and the Kochs and Kiratas living north of the river." (Majumdar, Dr. R.C., History of Ancient Bengal, First published 1971, Reprint 2005, p. 4, Tulshi Prakashani, Kolkata.)
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa provides a detailed account of the movement of people (Videgha Māthava, Gotama Rahugaṇa) from River Sarasvati to River Sadānīra. The location of
this river is central to the history of Pre-Mauryan era Bhāratam Janam (RV 3.53.12). The region of these people has been identified in this monograph and relates to the ironwork of the Bronze Age Sarasvati Civilization. It is possible that both Brahmautra and Ganga river systems were waterways which provided for maritime transport of tin ore from the Himalayan riverbasins (Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong) which contain the richest and largest tin belt of the globe (as the rivers ground down graniterocks to create the cassiterite -- tin ore -- deposit accumulations as placer deposits). Sources of tin were critical to unleash the Tin-Bronze Industrial Revolution of ca. 4th millennium BCE.

Videha (हवदेह) is the name of a country pertaining to the Oḍramāgadhī local usage (pravṛtti) according to the Nāṭyaśāstra chapter 14. These pravṛttis provide information regarding costumes, languages, and manners in different countries of the world. It is mentioned that this local usage (adopted by these countries) depends on the verbal style (bhāratī) and the graceful style (kaiśikī). The capital of Videha was Mithila, identified with the modern town of Janakpur in Southern Nepal.

Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (I.iv.1) ascribes the kingdom to Māthava the Videgha, and gives as its boundaries Kausiki in the east, the Ganges to the south, the Sadarura in the west, and the Himalaya in the north. In the centre of Videha was Pabbatarattha, in which was the city Dhammakonda, the residence of Dhaniya. (SNA.i.26).

14. Māthava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvatī. (Or, according to Sāyaṇa, he was then in the Sarasvatī, plunged into the river in order to quench the heat produced by Agni.) He (Agni) thence went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama Rāhūgaṇa and the Videgha Māthava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sadānīrā,' flows from the northern (Himālaya) mountain: that one he did not burn over. That one the Brāhmans did not cross in former times, thinking, 'it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaiśvānara.'
15. Now-a-days, however, there are many Brāhmans to the east of it. At that time it (the land east of the Sadānīrā) was very uncultivated, very marshy, because it had not been tasted by Agni Vaiśvānara.
[quote] Videgha Māthava ( videgha māthava , हवदेघ माथव) is a leader of an IndoAryan speaking tribe mentioned in the Vedic text Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa who, with the help of the fire god Agni, would lead his tribe eastward through the Ganges plain in northern India . have led. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa reports that Māthava's tribe initially lived on the Sarasvati , in western India. Māthava is said to have been accompanied by Gautama Rahugana on his trek to Videha and led his people to the then thickly vegetated Ganges plain in the east. The fire god Agni burned a path through the jungle, over which Māthava followed. He dried up all the rivers that the god encountered in his path, but the broad Sadānīrā (today's Gandak, which forms the border between the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar ) proved an impregnable horde. This, moreover, was the boundary of the area considered suitable as a residence for the Brahmin priests. The east was still unclean, since the fire god had not yet burned the land and thus ritually cleansed it. Therefore the god ordered Māthava to carry him across the river. On the other side, he burned away the vegetation so that the tribe could settle there. In later times, the Sadānīrā formed the boundary between the kingdoms of Koshala and Videha . The latter was named after the legendary chieftain who was considered to be the founder. [unquote]

There are several of Bharatas such as ĀdiBharata, Vṛddha-Bharata, Jaḍa Bharata and Bharata, the son of Duṣyanta.
Jaḍabharatākhyāna (जडिरताख्यान ) is in Viṣṇupurāṇa. Jaḍabharata (जडिरत) is the
disciple of Anādi: a teacher to whom the Kāpālika doctrine was revealed, mentioned in the Śābaratantra. The Śābara-tantra is an early tantra of the Kāpālika sect containing important information about the evolution of the Nātha sect. It also lists the twelve
original Kāpālika teachers and their disciples (eg., Jaḍabharata). Several of these names appear in the Nātha lists of eighty-four Siddhas and nine Nāthas. [Jābāla-upaniṣad; Bhāgavata-purāṇa v, 9 f.]

Story of Jaḍabharata (जडभरत) Second Section Viṣṇupurāṇa
Many years ago there used to live a king named Bharata. He was the son of Rishabha and used to live in a place known as Shalagrama. He thought of Vishnu all the time, even in his dreams and he had given up all thought of violence.
Once Bharata had gone to bathe in a river. A deer had also come to drink water there. While the deer was drinking water, there was the terrible roar of a lion. The deer gave a frightened leap and gave an untimely birth. The baby fell into the river. The mother deer died as a result of the leap. But Bharata rescued the baby deer from the water and brought it home to his ashrama (hermitage). Every day, the king fed the baby and slowly, the deer grew bigger. It wandered around the hermitage. Sometimes it even wandered out, but returned quickly as it was frightened of tigers. Asit grew older, the deer would leave the ashrama in the mornings and return in the evenings.
Bharata grew attached to the deer and forgot everything else. He had given up his kingdom, his sons, and his friends and forgotten them all. But he could not forget the deer. If the deer was late in returning to the ashrama, he would worry that it might have been eaten up by a wolf or a tiger or a lion. He would be happy only when the deer returned. And because Bharata thought about the deer so much, he forgot to think of Vishnu.
Many years passed. Bharata died watching the deer and thinking of it. Since he thought of the deer while dying, he was born as a deer in his next life. The only difference was that he was born as a jatismara deer, that is, a deer that remembered the incidents of its past life. As a deer, Bharata left his mother and came again to Shalagrama because he remembered his old place. He lived on dry leaves and dry grass and eventually died. He



31
was reborn as a jatismara brahmana. In this life he was truly learned, well versed in all the shastras.
Since he had attained the supreme knowledge, he saw no point in reading the Vedas or in doing work. He kept to himself and spoke little, only when he had to. His body was dirty, his clothes were filthy and he never cleaned his teeth. Because of this, people treated him badly. But since interaction with people was an obstacle to attaining supreme knowledge. Bharata kept up this pretence of beigh slightly mad. He moved so little that he came to known as Jababharata. He ate whatever was available to him. And when his father died, his brothers, nephews and friends, gave him only dirty food to eat. Since he was strong and stout, they used him in their farming work.
The sage Kapila had an ashrama on the banks of the river Ikshumati. One day, the King of Soubira wanted to go there on a planaquin to learn words of wisdom from the sage. The servant of the king looked for palanquin-bearers who would carry the palanquin free of charge and found Bharata. So Bharata bore the palanquin along with the other bearers. But he walked slowly while the other bearers walked fast. The result was that the palanquin did not move smoothly. When scolded, the other bearers naturally blamed Bharata for this difficulty.
“What is wrong?” Asked the king of Bharata, “Haven’t you borne the planquin only for a little while? How is it that you are tired? Can’t you bear a little burden? You look quite strong to me.”
Bharata’s answer was this. “Who am I and who are you? What you have seen is only my body and your body. I am not my body and nor are your your body. Our atmans or souls are what we really are. My atman is not strong or tired, nor is it carrying your palanquin upon its shoulders.”
Having said this, Bharata was quiet again. But the king got down from the palanquin and fell at his feet. He wanted to know who Bharata really was, for such words of wisdom do not come from an ordinary man. Bharata then told him the truth about the atman, which is never destroyed and takes up different bodies from one life to another. This is the jivatman. In additon, there is the paramatman, which I s Vishnu and is everywhere. There is no difference between the jivatman and the parmatman and the person who has realized this is truly wise. To think that the jivatman is different from the parmatman is to suffer from maya or illusion.
Bharata also told the king a story. Many years ago Brahma had a son known as Ribhu. Ribhu was very learned and his disciple was Nidagha, the son of Pulastya. The teacher and the pupil used to live in the banks of the river Devika, near a city known as Viranagara, but Ribhu realized that Nidagha was still not ready for the supreme knowledge. So he sent the pupil to live in the city, although he continued to live in the forest.
One day, Ribhu decided to pay Nidagha a visit to see how the disciple was getting on. After Ribhu had washed his hands and feet, Nidagha offered him food. “Please eat,” he said.
“What have you got to eat?” asked Ribhu. “Is it clean food?”



32
“I have rice and cerals and fruit and sweets.” Replied Nidagha.
“That is unclean food,” said the teacher. “Make me rice pudding, curds and wine.”
Nidagha asked his wife to prepare the desired food. The food was prepared and Ribhu had his fill.
“Are you content now?” asked Nidagha . “Where are you going and why did you come here?”
Ribhu replied as follows. “Those who are hungry become content on eating food. I was
not hungry, so the question of my being content after eating does not arise. Why ask me a silly question? The body feels hungry, I do not. I am not the body. You asked me where I was going and why did I come here. These are meaningless questions. My atman is everywhere, it cannot go or come. I am not really what you see. Nor are you what I see. I did not care at all about what you gave me to eat. I said all that just to see what you would say. Since all food is made of the same elements, it all tastes alike. Learn this, for this is true knowledge.”
Threreupon, Nidagha bowed down before Ribhu and said that his illusions have now been destroyed.
After one thousand years had passed, Ribhu came again to Nidagha. And he found that Nidagha now lived outside the city, eating grass and straw. He didn’t mix with other
people and had become frail and thin. Ribhu again gave him a lesson on true knowledge, which does not distinguish between all things and paramatman.
And Bharata said that this was the knowledge that the king should learn. The sky sometimes looks blue and sometimes white, but it is the same sky. These who suffer from illusions look upon different atmans separately. But they are truly all part of the same atman. There is nothing in the world except this atman and all of us are parts of the same atman.
This is the end of the second section of the Vishnu Purana.

In addition to the previously mentioned paramahaṃsas are these famous
wandering sannyāsīs (parivrajakas), Samvartaka, Aruṛinandana, Audṃlaka, Śvetaketu, Durvāsṃ, ṇbhu, Nidṃgha, Jaḍa Bharata, Dattṃtreya, Raivata, and so on. They are all paramahaṃsas; none of them wear the outward signs of varṇāśrama the śikhā and sacred thread of a brāhmaṇa. They are not mad but behave like madmen. The paramahaṃsa, saying the mantra bhū-svāhā (I offer you to the earth) leaves aside all external paraphernalia of the renounced order, including

the tridanḍa, staff, the waterpot, the begging bowl made from a gourd, the belt made of straw, the purifying cup for water, the tuft of hair, the sacred thread, and dedicates himself solely to following the order of the bona fide guru and the inner direction of the Paramātmā. (Jābālopanisad 6.1)
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1. by Julius Eggeling | 1882 | Kanda I, adhyaya 4, brahmana 1 1. He recites after uttering (the syllable) 'Hiṅ!' Sacrifice, they say, is not (performed) without the Sāman; and neither is the Sāman chanted without 'Hiṅ' having been uttered. By his uttering 'Hiṅ!' the peculiar nature (rūpam) of the word 'Hiṅ' is produced (in the sacrifice); and by the sacred syllable (om) it assumes the nature of the Sāman. By uttering 'Om! Om[1]!' this his entire sacrifice becomes endowed with the Sāman.
2. And (another reason) why he utters 'Hiṅ!' is this. The word 'Hiṅ' means breath, for the word Hiṅ' does indeed mean breath: he cannot therefore pronounce the word 'Hiṅ,' when he closes his nostrils. The ṛc (verse) he recites with his voice. Now, voice and breath are a
pair, so that a productive union of the sāmidhenīs is thereby effected at the outset: for this reason he recites, after uttering 'Hiṅ!'
3. He utters the word 'Hiṅ' in a low voice. Were he, on the contrary, to pronounce 'Hiṅ' aloud, he would make 'voice' of both the one and the other: for this reason he utters the word 'Hiṅ' in a low voice.
4. He recites with 'ā (hither)!' and 'pra (forth or thither)[2]!' He thereby joins
a gāyatrī verse directed hitherward to one directed away from here: the one which tends from hence carries the sacrifice to the gods, and the one which tends hitherward pleases the men. For this reason he recites with 'ā' and 'pra.'
5. And (another reason) why he recites with 'ā' and 'pra,' is this. 'Pra (forth)' clearly means
out-breathing, and 'ā (hither)' means in-breathing: hence he thereby obtains out-breathing and in-breathing (for the sacrificer). For this reason he recites with 'ā' and 'pra.'
6. Yet (other reasons) why he recites with 'hither (ā)' and 'thither (pra),' are these. 'Thither' the seed is cast, and 'hither' birth takes place. 'Thither' the cattle disperse (for grazing), 'hither' they return. Indeed, everything here (moves) 'hither' and 'thither:' for this reason he recites with 'ā' and 'pra.'
7. He recites[3], 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!'-hereby , then, the 'thither' is (realised). And (in the second verse), 'Come hither, Agni, to expand[4]!'--by this, on the other hand, the 'hither' is (realised).
8. Now, in reference to this point, some people say, 'Both these (texts) surely result in a "thither[5]."' This, however, is beyond the ordinary understanding: the text, 'forth go your viands, heavenward!' is clearly (directed) away from (the sacrificer); and the text, 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' is (directed) towards (him).
9. He recites (the first kindling verse), 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!' this, then, tends in a forward direction. 'Viands' (vāja)[6] he says, because viands mean food: hence food is obtained (for the sacrificer) by this recitation. 'Heavenward' he says, because those that tend heavenward are the half-moons:



34
it is, therefore, the half-moons which he obtains by this recitation. 'In havis rich' he further says, because those that are rich in havis (milk, butter) are the cattle; it is cattle, therefore, that he thereby obtains through the recitation.
10. 'With buttered (spoon)--' he adds. Now Māthava, the (king of) Videgha[7], carried Agni Vaiśvānara in his mouth. The Ṛṣi Gotama Rāhūgaṇa was his family priest. When
addressed (by the latter), he made no answer to him, fearing lest Agni might fall from his mouth.
11. He (the priest) began to invoke the latter with verses of the Rig-veda, 'We kindle thee at the sacrifice, O wise Agni, thee the radiant, the mighty caller to the sacrificial feast (Rig-veda V, 26, 3)!--O Videgha!'
12. He (the king) did not answer. (The priest went on), 'Upwards, O Agni, dart thy brilliant, shining rays, thy flames, thy beams (Rig-veda VIII, 44, 16)!--O Videgha-a-a!'
13. Still he did not answer. (The priest continued), 'Thee, O butter-sprinkled one, we invoke! (Rig-veda V, 26, 2);' so much he uttered, when at the very mentioning of butter, Agni Vaiśvānara flashed forth from the (king's) mouth: he was unable to hold him back; he issued from his mouth, and fell down on this earth.
14. Māthava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvatī[8]. He (Agni) thence
went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama Rāhūgaṇa and the Videgha Māthava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried up) all these
rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sadānīrā,' flows from the northern (Himālaya) mountain: that one he did not burn over. That one the Brāhmans did not cross in former times, thinking, 'it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaiśvānara.'
15. Now-a-days, however, there are many Brāhmans to the east of it. At that time it (the land east of the Sadānīrā) was very uncultivated, very marshy, because it had not been tasted by Agni Vaiśvānara.
16. Now-a-days, however, it is very cultivated, for the Brāhmans have caused (Agni) to
taste it through sacrifices. Even in late summer that (river), as it were, rages along[9]: so cold is it, not having been burnt over by Agni Vaiśvānara.
17. Māthava, the Videgha, then said (to Agni), 'Where am I to abide?' 'To the east of this (river) be thy abode!' said he. Even now this (river) forms the boundary of
the Kosalas and Videhas; for these are the Māthavas (or descendants of Māthava).
18. Gotama Rāhūgaṇa then said (to Māthava), 'Why didst thou not answer when addressed by us?' He replied, 'Agni Vaiśvānara was in my mouth; I did not reply, lest he should escape from my mouth.'
19. 'How then did this happen?'--'At the moment when thou didst utter the words, "(Thee), O butter-sprinkled one, we invoke!" just then, at the mention of butter, Agni
Vaiśvānara flashed forth from my mouth; I was unable to hold him back, he issued from my mouth.'
20. That (word) in the sāmidhenīs, therefore, which contains butter (ghṛta) is especially suitable for kindling (sam-indh); and by it he accordingly kindles him (Agni, the fire) and bestows vigour on this (sacrificer).



35
21. Now that (word) is ghṛtācyā, 'with the buttered (spoon).'--'He nears[10] the gods,
wishful of bliss.' Wishful of bliss, truly, is the sacrificer, since he wishes to approach the gods, to go to[11]
the gods: therefore he says, 'he nears the gods, wishful of bliss.' This (verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined (vague); and undefined, doubtless, is the 'All;' he thus commences (this holy work) with the All.
22. [He recites the second sāmidhenī]: 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!'--'To expand' he says, because at the beginning these worlds were well-nigh contiguous to one another: at that time one could touch the sky thus[12].
23. The gods desired, 'How could these worlds of ours become farther apart from one another? How could there be more space for us?' They breathed through them (the worlds) with these three syllables (forming the word) 'vītaye[13],' and these worlds became far apart from one another; and there was then ampler space for the gods: ample space, therefore, he will have for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse) containing (the word) 'vītaye.'
24. He proceeds, 'Invoked for the giver of oblations!' 'The giver of oblations[14],' of course, is the sacrificer: hence 'invoked for the sacrificer' is what he thereby means to
say.--'As Hotṛ on the barhis sit!' Agni, indeed, is the Hotṛ, and the barhis (the covering of sacrificial grass on the altar) is this world: hence he thereby establishes Agni (the fire) in this world, as this fire is established (or, beneficial, hita) in this world. This (verse), then, is recited with reference to this world (the earth): through it this world is conquered by him for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse).
25. [He recites the third sāmidhenī]: 'With samidhs thee, O Aṅgiras!'--with samidhs (kindling-sticks), indeed, the Aṅgiras kindled him. 'O Aṅgiras!' he says, for Agni is indeed Aṅgiras[15].--'With butter we exhilarate!' This (viz. ghṛtena, 'with butter') is a word which is especially suitable for the kindling of Agni: by it he kindles him, and bestows vigour on this (sacrificer).
26. 'Shine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!' he adds; for brilliantly he shines, when kindled; and 'O youngest!' he says, because he is really the youngest Agni[16]: therefore he says, 'O youngest!' This (verse) is recited with reference to yonder world, to wit, the aërial world; hence this (verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined, for undefined is yonder world: that world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this verse.
27. [He recites the fourth sāmidhenī]: 'Agni, do thou obtain for us that (region) wide and glorious!' For wide, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods (dwell), and glorious is that (region) wherein the gods (dwell). When he says, 'Do thou obtain for us[17],' he means to say, 'make us go to it!'
28. 'That great and mighty one, O God!' For great, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods (dwell), and mighty[18] is that wherein the gods (dwell). This (verse), then, is recited with reference to yonder world: that heavenly world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse).
29. He recites (the fifth sāmidhenī): 'Praiseworthy he, adorable,' for worthy of praise he is, and worthy of adoration;--'visible through the veil of gloom,' for when kindled he is



36
seen right through the gloom;--'Agni, the mighty one (bull), is lit,' for he is indeed lit up, the mighty one.
[He recites the sixth sāmidhenī]: 'The mighty Agni is lit up,' for he is indeed lit up.
30. 'Yea[19], as a horse that bears the gods,' for having become a horse he does indeed carry the sacrifice to the gods: the (word) 'na' which occurs in this verse has the meaning of 'om' (verily); hence he says, 'Yea, as a horse that bears to the gods.'
31. 'With offerings him they glorify,' for with offerings men indeed glorify him; therefore he says, 'with offerings him they glorify.'
32. [He recites the seventh sāmidhenī): 'O mighty one[20]! we mighty men do kindle thee, the mighty one!' for they indeed kindle him;--'O Agni, thee that brightly shines!' for he indeed shone brightly when he was kindled.
33. He recites this tristich which contains the word (vṛṣan), 'mighty.' All these kindling verses, it is true, are addressed to Agni; Indra, however, is the deity of sacrifice, Indra is the mighty (hero); hence these his (the sacrificer's) kindling verses thereby become possessed of Indra: this is the reason why he recites the tristich containing the word 'mighty.'
34. He recites [the eighth sāmidhenī]: 'Agni we choose as messenger!' Now the gods and
the Asuras, both of them sprang from Prajāpati, were contending for superiority. When they were thus contending, the gāyatrī stood between them. That gāyatrī was the same as this earth, and this earth indeed lay between them[21]. Now both of them knew that whichever she would side with, they would be victorious and the others would be defeated. Both parties then invited her secretly to come to them. Agni acted as messenger for the gods; and an Asura-Rakṣas, named
Saharakṣas[22], for the Asuras. She then followed Agni: he therefore recites, 'Agni we choose for messenger,' because he was the messenger of the gods.--'As Hotṛ the allknowing, him!'
35. Here now some people recite, 'He who is the Hotṛ of the all-knowing[23];' lest (in saying 'for Hotṛ, the all-knowing, him') one should say to oneself 'enough (i.e. have done)!' This, however, he should not do; for by (doing) so they do at the sacrifice what is human; and what is human, is inauspicious at a sacrifice. Therefore, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice, he should recite, just as it is recited by the Ṛk, 'for
Hotṛ, the all-knowing, him!' [He continues], 'Performing well this sacrifice!' for he, Agni, is indeed a good performer of the sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'performing well this sacrifice.' She (gāyatrī, or the earth) sided with the gods, and the gods thereupon were victorious and the Asuras were defeated: and verily he for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse), is himself victorious and his adversaries are defeated.
36. He therefore recites this, the eighth sāmidhenī). This, indeed, is peculiarly a gāyatrī verse, since it is of eight syllables that the gāyatrī (metre) consists: for this reason he recites the eighth (sāmidhenī).
37. Here now some people place the two (dhāyyās) additional kindling verses before (the eighth sāmidhenī), arguing, 'The two dhāyyās[24] mean food: this edible food we place in front (or, in the mouth, mukhataḥ).' But let him not do this: for with him who inserts the



37
additional verses before (the eighth), the latter (the eighth) is clearly out of its place[25], since in that case it (and the succeeding verse) become the tenth and eleventh verses. With him, on the other hand, for whom they recite this as the eighth (kindling verse), it is indeed in its proper place: let him therefore insert the two additional verses after (the ninth).
38. [He recites the ninth kindling verse]: 'He who is kindled at the cult'--the cult (adhvara), doubtless, is the sacrifice: 'he who is kindled at the sacrifice' he thereby says;-'Agni, the bright, the laudable,' for he is both bright and laudable;--'the flaming-locked, him we adore!' for when he is kindled, his locks, as it were, flame. Previously to (the beginning of the tenth verse), 'O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit!' let him (the Adhvaryu) put on all the kindling-sticks with the exception of the one stick (which is to be put on at the after-offerings[26]); for it is now that the Hotṛ completes (the kindling); and what then is left of the kindling-sticks, other than the one stick, that is left (unused altogether); and what is left (unused) of the sacrifice, that is left for his (the sacrificer's) spiteful enemy: let him, therefore, previously to this (verse), put on all the samidhs, save one.
39. [He continues]: 'Adore, good worshipper, the gods!' worship (adhvara) doubtless means sacrifice: 'adore the gods, good sacrificer,' he thereby says;--'Oblation-bearer, sure, art thou!' for he, Agni, is indeed the bearer of oblations: for this reason he says 'oblationbearer, sure, art thou.' [He recites the last sāmidhenī]: 'Make offerings! do reverence!
Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds, for your oblation-bearer choose!' by this (verse) he urges them on: 'make offerings and worship! do this for (the accomplishment) of whatever desire you kindled him!' this is what he thereby means to say. 'Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds,' he says, because cult means sacrifice: hence he thereby says, 'him, Agni, whilst the sacrifice proceeds;'--'for your oblation-bearer choose!' for he, Agni, is indeed the oblation-bearer, and for this reason he says 'for your oblation-bearer choose (him)!'
40. This tristich, containing (the word) 'cult (adhvara),' he thus recites. For once when the gods were engaged in sacrificing, their rivals, the Asuras, wished to injure (dhurv, dhvar) them; but, though desirous of injuring them, they were unable to injure them and were foiled: for this reason the sacrifice is called adhvara ('not damaged, uninterrupted'); and for whomsoever, that knows this, they recite this tristich containing (the word) adhvara ('cult, sacrifice'), his rival, though desirous of injuring him, is foiled; and he, (the sacrificer), moreover, gains as much as one gains by offering a Soma-sacrifice[27].

The particles pra and ā were apparently used in phrases wishing one a safe journey and return (cf. Ait. Br. 3, 26, with Haug's note). The first sāmidhenī begins, 'prá vo vā ́gā abhídyavaḥ' (forth go your viands, heavenward); and the second 'ágna ā ́ yāhi vītáye'
(come hither, Agni, to the feast!). It is from these verses that the above symbolical explanation is derived. Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 7, 3 [prācīnaṃ reto dhīyate-pratīcīḥ prajā jāyante].

[3]: The following is a connected translation (as literal as possible, if not elegant) of the
eleven sāmidhenīs, or kindling verses, in the same octosyllabic metre as the original. The
first and eleventh verses are recited three times; and when at the end of each verse the
Hotṛ pronounces the syllable oṃ, the Adhvaryu throws a stick (samidh) into the fire,--up to the eighth verse, at the end of which the tenth stick is thrown in. At the end of the ninth verse five of the remaining six sticks are thrown into the fire. The throwing of the first stick is accompanied by the sacrificer pronouncing the dedicatory formula (tyāga), 'For Agni this, not for me!' [4]: See further on, par. 22 seq. [5]:
Inasmuch as Agni, whilst coming to the sacrifice, goes away from the gods. Sāy.
[6]:
In the Taitt. S. II, 5, 7, 3-4 also vāja is in the first place rendered by 'food,' while afterwards it is identified with the months (i.e. the coursers? gamanaśīla, Sāy.); as
abhidyavaḥ (in the sense of 'shining in both directions,' i.e. in the form of the waxing and waning moon, Sāy.) is referred to the half-moons. [7]: To this important legend attention was first drawn by Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 170 seq. (cf. also Ind. Streifen, I, p. 13; J. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, II, p. 402). It was pointed out by Weber that this legend distinguishes three successive stages of the eastward migration of the Brāhmanical Hindus. In the first place the settlements of the Āryans had already
been extended from the Pañjab (where they were settled in the times of the hymns of the Rig-veda) as far as the Sarasvatī. They thence pushed forward, led by the Videgha Māthava and his priest, according to our legend, as far east as the river Sadānīrā (that is, 'she that is always filled with water'), which, according to Sāyaṇa, is another name for the Karatoyā (the modern Kurattee, on which Bograh lies), which formed the eastern boundary of the Videhas; or more probably the Gaṇḍakī (the modern Gunduck, a noble river which falls into the Ganges opposite Patna, and) which formed the boundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas (cf. par. 17). It would appear from our legend, that for some time the Aryans did not venture to cross this river; but at the time of the author the country to the east of it had long been occupied by them. Sāyaṇa takes the hero of the legend to be Videgha, the Mādhava or son of Madhu; but Videgha, an older form of Videha, is more probably intended here (as Weber takes it) for the name of that people and country (corresponding to the modern Tirhut). The Agni Vaiśvānara (or Agni who is common to all men) of our legend Professor Weber considers a personification of Brāhmanical worship and civilisation and the destructive effects of their extension.

Or, according to Sāyaṇa, he was then in the Sarasvatī, plunged into the river in order to quench the heat produced by Agni. [9]: That is to say, it is not affected by the heat of the summer, as the other rivers, but rushes along as rapidly and as well-filled as ever. [10]:
Jigāti is taken by Sāyaṇa in the sense of 'he sings, praises.' Our author, on the other hand, seems to interpret it by 'he conquers (ji);' see, however, next note. [11]:
The text has, 'Sa hi devān jigīṣati sa hi devān jigāṃsati.' The Kāṇva recension has the same reading, except that it omits 'hi' p. 107 in both cases. Instead of jigāṃsati, however,



39
some MSS., as well as Sāyaṇa, read jighāṃsati ('he wishes to conquer, or beat, the gods'), probably an old corruption, easily accounted for by the circumstance that jigiṣati is the
regular desiderative of ji, 'to conquer,' though it also occurs in some passages as the
desiderative of gā, 'to go.' Sāyaṇa, however, though he reads jighāṃsati, here allows to
the root han (with Naigh. 2, 14) the meaning of 'to go.' Cf. Weber, Omina and Portenta, p. 406, note 4. [12]:
Viz. by stretching the arms upwards. Sāyaṇa. [13]: That is, vi-itaye, 'for going asunder,' a fanciful analysis of the word vīti; the correct rendering is 'for the meal or food,' 'for the feast.' [14]:
Havyadāti, the correct meaning of the word is 'the giving of oblations.'
[15]:
Rig-veda I, 31, 1, he is called the first of the Aṅgiras.
[16]:
The fire which has just been kindled is frequently called the youngest (yaviṣṭha). Sāyaṇa
takes it as 'the ever young.' See also the legend regarding the three Agnis who preceded the present Agni in the office of divine Hotṛ, I, 2, 3, 1; 3, 3, 13.

Vivāsasi, Sāyaṇa explains it by prakāsaya, 'illuminate it;' but cf. Sāyaṇa on Rig-veda VI, 16, asmān accha abhigamaya, 'make it (dhanam) come to us.' [18]: Suvīrya is taken by our author as an adjective, co-ordinate with the others; but it is evidently a noun ('abundance of heroes' or 'manliness, manly power,' St. Petersburg Dictionary) qualified by the adjectives. [19]: Na is taken by our author as a particle of asseveration; though in reality it is a particle of comparison. In later Sanskrit na is only used as particle of negation. [20]: Vṛṣan, 'the male, the vigorous one, the bull;' cf. Max Müller, Translation of Rig-veda Sanhitā, I, p. 121 seq. [21]: 'On the top of Mount Meru lies the city of Amarāvatī, wherein the gods dwell; and beneath Meru lies Irāvatī, the city of the Asuras: between these two lies the earth.' Sāyaṇa. [22]: Cf. the corresponding passage in Taitt. S. II, 5, 11, 8, where Daivya is given as the name of the messenger of the Asuras. [23]:
That is to say, instead of 'Hotāraṃ viśvavedasam,' they recite 'Hotā yo viśvavedasaḥ;' for the reason that Hotāram (accusative of hotṛ) might be understood to be 'hotā aram,' aram, 'enough,' being a particle implying a prohibition. Our author, however, promptly sets his face against this application of human reasoning to an inspired text. [24]: Whenever thirteen kindling verses are recited instead of eleven (or counting the repetitions of the first and last verses, seventeen instead of fifteen), the two verses Rigveda III, 27, 5 and 6 are inserted according to our author after the ninth, and according to others before the eighth, sāmidhenī. They are called dhāyyā, probably derived from dhā,



40
'to put, add,' whilst those ritualists whose practice is here rejected apparently connect the word with the root dhā (dhe), 'to suck.'
[25]:
According to Sāyaṇa, because it no longer occupies the eighth place for which it is specially appropriate on account of its being, according to our author, 'peculiarly a gāyatrī (eight-syllabled) verse.' This reasoning is far from satisfactory, since the two dhāyyās (Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6) are also gāyatrī verses. [26]: See I, 8, 2, 3. [27]: Saumya adhvara is the common designation of the solemn Soma-sacrifice; hence, our author argues, the word adhvara is here used for sacrifice (yajña) with a view to insure to this offering the efficacy of a Soma-sacrifice.
