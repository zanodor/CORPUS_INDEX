# Index for Jerald Jack Starr – Rebuttal of Andrea Sinclair's rant - SumerianShakespeare-com.pdf

Idiot
36-45 minutes
On April 20, 2018, Andrea Sinclair posted a blog page that she described
as a “scathing review” of my website, specifically my two pages where I
explained the Sumerian context of the Gebel el-Arak knife and the
Hierakonpolis painting. By “scathing” Andrea Sinclair means “insult and
ridicule”. This is her idea of academic debate. At first, I tried to ignore Ms.
Sinclair because her writing is so silly and so riddled with errors that I
thought no one would take it seriously. Then I noticed that the BANEA
Facebook (British Association of Near Eastern Archaeology) stopped
posting my pages after Andrea Sinclair’s snarky comments. I realized that
some people are foolish enough to listen to her. The Sumerian context of
the
Gebel el-Arak knife and the Hierakonpolis painting is much too important
to let Ms. Sinclair
have the last word, so here is my reply to her ranting and raving (by her
own admission
she calls it a rant).
I urge the reader to read my pages about the Gebel el-Arak knife and the
Hierakonpolis painting before proceeding with this one. Make up your
own mind about them before listening to Andrea Sinclair’s sneering
“commentary”.
Andrea Sinclair’s blog is called:
Artistic licence or why i trust no one
It’s an ironic title, as you will soon discover.

Where academic research into iconography and art history finds its
expression. Otherwise being an outlet for various rants about
misrepresenting and rewriting of ancient Near Eastern text and image
in modern western scholarship and media.

The following serves as an illustration of the pitfalls of writing beyond
your knowledge base and also for talking to people who are experts in
another area if you can’t be bothered doing the required amount of study
yourself.
As we shall soon see, Andrea Sinclair did not study at all.
And incidentally, that free access to books online is pretty much useless
when this only provides outdated research. It is possibly also a
recommendation not to write and drink at the same time. But this is
more of a guideline.
Your drunken tirade, Andrea Sinclair, proves that you should follow your
own advice.
For some reason the amateur history blog Sumerian Shakespeare who
writes up ancient Mesopotamian topics took it upon themselves to
critique objects from Predynastic Egypt in two of their posts. In the past
I had assumed this blog was an adequate if unimaginative introduction
to Mesopotamian culture for keen learners, but with the added bonus of

nice pictures that are credited. I have since altered this stance. Now I
find their blog shallowly researched, outdated, a bit racist, pseudo
archaeological nonsense that is effectively dressed up to look like
‘educated’ critique.
Racist? Really? I suggest those who bandy about unfounded charges of
“racism” are the
worst racists of all.
We will soon see the shallowness of Andrea Sinclair’s own research. It's an
inch deep.
The Hierakonpolis painting and the Gebel el Arak knife
The overall premise of both blog articles by Sumerian Shakespeare is
that while the Sumerians could not have settled Egypt and founded the
Egyptian state (an outdated theory from the early 20th century) they
could have mounted rustling expeditions ... have a think about that ... a
rustling expedition ... or two.
There is only one rustling expedition, not two. On the Hierakonpolis
painting, animals
are being lassoed, corrals are broken open, herds are scattered, and
captured animals
are trussed up with ropes to make them easy to transport.
This glorious theory is supported by the fact that the two examples that
they cite are contemporary and from the same region, Abydos ... Well ...
no ... there is no evidence for where the knife came from. It was
purchased from a Cairo dealer by George Benedité for the Louvre
collection, and is only reputedly from Gebel el Arak near Abydos.
On the page about the Hierakonpolis painting, I stated,” The provenance
of the knife wasn't known. It was allegedly from Gebel el-Arak, 60 miles
north of Hierakonpolis. There aren't
any major archaeological sites in Gebel el-Arak, so the curators made an
educated guess
and assumed that the knife was probably from nearby Abydos.” You would
know that,
Andrea Sinclair, if you weren’t such a shallow reader. Don’t try to correct

me on one of
the few examples where we actually agree.
Although I acknowledged that the knife was reputedly from Abydos, I
went on to suggest that the knife is really from Tomb 100 in
Hierakonpolis.
In addition, the painting and knife are not contemporary. The knife is
dated to Naqada IIIA (c. 3350-3150 BCE), Tomb 100 at Hierakopolis is
earlier and dated to Naqada IIC
(c. 3500 BCE). They are, at best, a hundred years apart, or likely more.
The tomb and the knife are exactly contemporary. They belonged to the
same man.
Remember what Andrea Sinclair says about the dating of the artifacts. I
will refer to it later.

The critique of the Gebel el Arak knife (Aug 2016)
The knife is a flint blade with a carved ivory handle that has always
attracted plenty of commentary, so this choice is rather predictable. The
post itself is basically introduced with the assertion that the writer
decided to study the knife, because upon finding it in a web search of
Sumerian images they were sure it was Sumerian, not Egyptian. So like

all good critical thinkers (from 1899) they set out to prove their theory
was correct.
As is to be expected, a great deal of waffle about this object revolves
around the master of animals figure between two lions that is on one side
of the knife. However, the writer immediately recognises him as the
Sumerian shepherd king from Uruk in southern Mesopotamia. Here we
have a glorious example of early 20th century Biblical terminology being
imposed on this early Mesopotamian motif, which is usually called a
‘priest-king’.
I never referred to him as a “priest-king”. I refer to him as a “king”, and
only as a king.
He wears a shepherd’s hat, the crown of a Sumerian king. On the page
about
The Kings of Uruk, I explained the difference between a Sumerian priest, a
priest-king,
and a king. I am the only in the world who has done so. Andrea Sinclair
would know this
if she had actually read my website. To summarize, “For the sake of
reference, the ruler of Uruk is a priest when he is shown nude, he is a
priest-king when he wears the ceremonial netted skirt of Inanna, and he is
a king when he wears a regular skirt.” The Uruk king on the Gebel el-Arak
knife is wearing a regular skirt (typical of Uruk at this stage of history), in
case Andrea Sinclair didn’t notice. I don’t know where she got the idea
that a “priest-king”
is an example of “early 20th century Biblical terminology”.
‘For a hundred years there has been a lot of scholarly debate about the
identity of this man, none of which is correct’... Cocky arse.
Now that’s mature.
So, Andrea Sinclair, that’s how you want to play it? Okay. You want
attitude? I’ll show you attitude.

The Gebel el Arak knife handle. Image Wikipedia.
Once the writer has exhausted all the generic comparisons to 4th and 3rd
millennium Sumerian glyptic to justify their claims, they arbitrarily
switch sides of the knife and deal with the battle scene on the opposing
side. This incidentally ignores the desert hunt imagery on the previous
side.
Actually, I went to great length to explain the animal imagery on the Gebel
el-Arak knife.
Ms. Sinclair would know this if she wasn’t just skimming the article. To
summarize,
so even a beetle-brow like Andrea Sinclair can understand it, “The
continuous presence
of animals in the iconography of the Uruk king is meant to establish his
identity as a shepherd, as the guardian and protector of his flock, the
people [...] This is why animals
are often in the presence of the Uruk king.”
By the way, there are boats on a river, so this is no “desert hunt”.
And apparently on viewing the new scene, the penis sheaths worn by all
combatants made them quite uncomfortable:
‘All of the soldiers wear penis sheathes. It’s beyond me why any man
would wear this
ridiculous contraption, especially in combat – but there it is. I have to

admit, I was very
disappointed to see the Sumerians thus attired. I always assumed that
the Sumerians,
even at their most primitive, were more civilized than that.’
Andrea Sinclair loves penis sheathes. She is obsessed with them. The
doctor said it was the worst case of “penis sheath envy” that he had ever
seen.
Then there is a lot of time wasted on describing the fighters – where the
dominant figures
with no hair are designated as Sumerians versus their opponents, the
long haired Egyptians. Let us just ignore that the fighting figures are
equal in size and are all dressed in those penis sheaths. Then some
considerable time is spent identifying the boats, basically still intended to
prove that the boats on the lower part of the handle are all Sumerian, not
Egyptian.
These are the Egyptian boats:
On the other hand...

This is one of the Sumerian boats (they are in the middle register of the
handle,
not the lower one, as Andrea Sinclair mistakenly claims):
These Sumerian boats are very distinctive. No other boats in history look
quite the same.
The artist who created the Gebel el-Arak knife included the Sumerian
boats to show this is
a foreign invasion by the Sumerians, and not just a civil war between
neighboring Egyptian
tribes in the region. The Sumerian boats prove there is a Sumerian context
to the knife.
To conclude the piece the writer backflips their entire argument and says
that the knife cannot be Sumerian [...]
I never said the knife is Sumerian. At the beginning of the article I clearly
said, “... the
Gebel el-Arak knife is not Sumerian.” Do you even know how to read,
Andrea Sinclair?
Are you dyslexic?
[...] because a real battle between Egypt and the ‘marines’ of a Sumerian
shepherd king is not possible. They instead state that the artist copied
details from Sumerian seals and artefacts, but did not understand all

their iconography so drew what they knew. Which rather insanely
explains away all the Predynastic Egyptian features of the knife.
Clearly, the Gebel el-Arak knife has both Egyptian and Sumerian features.
It is the key to understanding the narrative of events that is portrayed on
the knife. Andrea Sinclair doesn’t see this, which is why she doesn’t have
the slightest idea what she is talking about.
Notice that Andrea Sinclair doesn’t offer her own interpretation of the
events that are depicted on the Gebel el-Arak knife. Nor does she explain
why it includes a portrait of a Sumerian king.
Then they end on their awkwardness with penises again. ‘That is why he
[the artist] shows them wearing penis sheathes like the Egyptians. (I was
relieved to know that my beloved Sumerians never wore these ridiculous
accoutrements.)’
Andrea Sinclair doesn’t like it when someone criticizes Egyptian penis
sheathes. She doesn’t like it at all.

But it did not stop there and in February of this year Sumerian
Shakespeare produced a sequel:
The critique of the Hierakonpolis tomb painting (Feb 2018)
With this piece a lot of time was again wasted by the writer in self
satisfied waffle about their own ability to reinterpret ancient art, but

when conclusions come they are odd and based on this person's intuitive
perceptions of a modern painting of an ancient painting. Admittedly
these conclusions are entirely consistent with the previous ramble.
If Andrea Sinclair wants to claim that the watercolor is not an accurate
depiction of the
tomb mural, she needs to show some proof.
The images they use are incidentally a watercolour and a line drawing
from the original excavation report in around 1900-2. Their only other
literary source appears to be an article from 1962. But they clearly
ignored most of its content, as that article assumes the imagery is
Predynastic Egyptian.
Above, Andrea Sinclair states, ”Tomb 100 at Hierakopolis [sic] is earlier
and dated to
Naqada IIC (c. 3500 BCE).” Predynastic dates from 3100 BC all the way
back to the
Neolithic Age (4500 BC). The Naqada IIC period is Predynastic! Good
grief, Andrea Sinclair.
You have just flunked Egyptology 101.
The haphazard narrative style is, like before, quite confusing and
contradictory, as though they were just writing out their thought
processes (at 2 am in the morning).
All of which applies to Andrea Sinclair’s writing, which is just shy of
coherence. Again,
Andrea Sinclair, don’t drink when you are trying to write a scholarly
paper, not at 2 am,
or at any other time. And don’t do drugs.
Anyway, some highlights:
The writer claims that all the red figures in the painting are Sumerians,
and the white figures are Egyptians ... this assumption is based on
schematic figures and goes against the Egyptian convention for the
colour of people, red-brown was for Egyptian men, light colouring were
used to depict Egyptian women. Although, I am not confident to push
that convention into the Predynastic. However, the easiest way to find
differentiation is to look at costume and hair. They do not do this, and all

figures in the drawing are, by the way, red-brown to dark brown.
The Sumerian (right) is colored red. The Egyptian is drawn in red but
colored white.
I did look at the costumes. This is how I identified Lord Hierakon (right).
Andrea Sinclair seems to suggest that he is a woman.
The costumes is also how I identified the two looters who plundered the
lord’s wardrobe.
The costumes match the standard of the captured lord.
Notice that Andrea Sinclair doesn’t offer her own explanation for the
costumes.

There’s no point in looking at the hair because all of the men on the
Hierakonpolis painting
are shown bald. Apparently, Andrea Sinclair failed to notice this obvious
fact.

1902.
There is some fairly predictable use of the media worthy cliché about
experts being baffled for 100 years ... yes, that’s us ...
No, not you, Andrea Sinclair. You are not an expert, not by any stretch of
the imagination.
[The experts were] baffled by the image of goats encircling a wheel like
enclosure.
Andrea Sinclair is still baffled by the enclosure.
The writer calls this symbol a ‘carousel’ in what can only be a ludicrously
subjective manner [...]
I said it looks like a carousel. Then in the next sentence I said, “I finally
realized that it is actually a corral. The animals are standing in it.”

So, I distinctly said it is a corral. In the very next sentence I even said,
“This is an important
clue to the painting. You cannot understand the Hierakonpolis mural until
you understand
the meaning of this corral” (italics added). Then I mentioned the corral
six more times
on the page! It’s one of the central themes on the article!
This is further evidence that Andrea Sinclair should not read or write
when she is drunk.
She cannot understand a simple sentence! I used to score standardized
tests for a living,
and I can honestly say that any 4th grader scores higher in Reading
Comprehension than
Ms. Sinclair does.

trying to control nature well after everybody else had moved on like

control wild animals at a later date in history, then she will need to offer
some proof.
Regardless, the circular design that is called a carousel is probably an

animal trap. Traps or hides for wild animals were a common motif of
control in Egyptian funerary art, early and later.
If this is a trap, Andrea Sinclair needs to describe the mechanism that was
used to
spring the trap. And where’s the funeral?
Apparently this trying to tame nature is why the master of animals was
so compelling to the Egyptians ... was it? ... oh oh ... wrong culture right
there.
The Egyptians obviously knew about the Sumerian Master of Animals.
That is why he appears on both the Gebel el-Arak knife and the
Hierakonpolis painting.
The Sumerian Master of Animals
Hierakonpolis was the home of the world's first zoo. The king kept wild
animals (including elephants and a hippopotamus) to show his total
control over the natural world. This supernatural power demonstrated his
divine right to rule. That was why the Sumerian
Master of Animals was such a compelling figure for the ancient Egyptians.
While the writer assumes control of wild nature was a compelling motif,
they appear unaware that the Egyptians made a distinction between
domesticated animals and the desert dwellers.
Actually, I spent a great deal of time explaining the difference between
wild animals and domesticated animals. Andrea Sinclair must have

missed this part when she was
bouncing off the walls in a drunken stupor.
Symbolically speaking they were the difference between social order and
chaos.
Animals never meant the difference between social order and chaos. Not
in any culture,
ever. Instead, the god-like power to control nature demonstrates the king’s
divine right
to rule.
However, in ignorance of this, instead the writer states that the wild
antelopes are all livestock ... Egyptian livestock that is ripe for rustling ...
so they are thinking quite subjectively and a fan of cowboy movies.
According to Sumerian Shakespeare the entire painting is about warfare
brought about through a spot of livestock theft ... They argue the
painting illustrates the invasion of Egypt by a Sumerian expedition.
It really is a Sumerian expedition. The red Master of Animals is
quintessentially Sumerian,
the red invaders are his men, and they arrive in Egypt by boat.

1902.
The flotilla of boats that dominate the composition are Sumerian boats
and the red skinned Sumerians in long white skirts are the captains of
the ships. On the largest boat Sumerian warriors are surrounding and
capturing an Egyptian leader who is in a pavilion. Short pause as they
talk about lord Hierakon and I wonder vaguely who he is? Apparently
the captive leader on this boat can’t be him ... oh it is his tomb ... gotcha
Andrea Sinclair did not consider the man for whom the tomb was built. If
she had thought about it for one minute, she might have gained some
insight into the events that are
portrayed on the painting.
... because he wouldn’t put a record of his own public embarrassment in
his tomb. Therefore it must be a neighbour who was attacked by the
Sumerians ... seriously? ... although another part of me is like, Lord
Hierakon, eh ... sounds sinister ... wait, I’m thinking of the vampire lord.
Okay, now you’re just being silly, Andrea Sinclair. “Hierakon means
"falcon”, polis means “city”. Hierakonpolis is the City of the Falcon”, as
explained in the opening sentences
of my page. How can you write about Hierakonpolis if you don’t know
what it means?
Then the writer heads off at a tangent and compares this imagery to the
battle scene from the Gebel el Arak knife and gives some scintillating
commentary on that. Apparently on the knife the Egyptians were also
overwhelmed in an attack, by that shepherd king and his marines ...
The Egyptians are momentarily overwhelmed in the battles depicted on
both the Gebel
el-Arak knife and the Hierakonpolis painting. No other battle scene in the
ancient world
shows the heroes losing the battle, even for a little while. This reinforces
my claim that
the Gebel el-Arak knife and the Hierakonpolis painting belonged to the
same man.

Then we return to the Hierakonpolis painting and the scene of a man
facing two lions that is in the upper left part of the painting, and without
any pause for breath the writer says that this small scheme shows the
lion pals of the Sumerians, because the lions are totally chilled and not
hostile ... muahaha ... therefore they must be pets!
As the (il)logical extension of this idea, the armed male figure is therefore
siccing (not my term) his lions on the antelopes!
Andrea Sinclair makes the stupid, careless mistake of saying the armed
man shown above is siccing his lions on the antelopes.

17 of 30 8/18/2020, 5:28 PM



Actually, this is the man who is siccing a lion on the animals, and they are
ibexes, not antelopes.
So there it is, in a nutshell.
The second piece claims that on the Hierakonpolis tomb painting the
Sumerians are rustling the Egyptian herds of domestic antelope with
their highly trained pet lions.
The Sumerian Master of Animals is the controller of animals. It’s who he
is, what he does.
‘That's it boys, saddle up the boats, we need to travel a few weeks with
our trusty pet lions and rustle us some ibex in Egypt.’ ... (me btw)
Andrea Sinclair thinks that being cutesy is an acceptable substitute for
scholarly debate.
After this bombshell, Sumerian Shakespeare puts some time into
explaining with maps how the Sumerians might have travelled in boats
all the way to Hierakonpolis (in inland Upper Egypt) ... just to rustle
some livestock ... I might add. Then they backflip again by saying it
couldn’t happen and the Egyptians just thought they were Sumerians
... eh?

18 of 30 8/18/2020, 5:28 PM



Andrea Sinclair is easily confused. I made it quite clear that both battle
scenes are “hypothetical”. They show what would happen if the Sumerians
attacked Egypt.
Basically the writer of these pieces can’t make up their mind whether the
Sumerians could invade Egypt or not, and repeatedly contradict
themselves. After all, if it is too far to settle, invade, or whatever, it is
also technically too far for spot rustling raids. And how did they go with
all those pet lions and antelopes on the long boat trip home?
Did anybody get back alive?
I never said the Sumerians brought the lions with them. For the record,
the lions are
Egyptian. The irony is the Sumerian Master of Animals turned the
Egyptians’ own lions
against them. He could control the Egyptian lions just as easily as the
Sumerian lions.
After all, it’s not like the lions spoke different languages.
Andrea Sinclair doesn’t offer her own explanation for the symbiotic
relation between the Sumerians and the lions. No one can pretend to
understand the narrative of the Hierakonpolis painting without explaining
what is happening with the lions.
Andrea Sinclair makes the same mistake as previous scholars (I use this
term loosely
in reference to Andrea Sinclair) by assuming that the painting is just a

“catalog of themes
and motifs”, a variety of unrelated images without any overall coherent
meaning.
It is actually a highly complex and cohesive narrative. She doesn’t give the
artist
proper credit for his work because she doesn’t understand the artistic
mind, even though
she purports to be an artist. Andrea Sinclair’s idea of art is to make
lifeless, unimaginative copies of other people’s work.
Finally, to conclude both articles Sumerian Shakespeare ties it all
seamlessly together with the pithy conclusion that these Sumerian
rustling events on the Hierakonpolis painting and on the Gebel el Arak
knife were so traumatic for the Predynastic Egyptian rulers that they
caused political collaboration between tribal groups which resulted in
state formation in Egypt ...
The threat of foreign invasion always provides a compelling reason for
national unity.
Now I really need a lie down.
Yes, sleep it off, Andrea Sinclair, and take an Alka-Selzer. You’ll be
hungover when you
wake up.
Conclusions
Basically this was a farce from go to woah. So lets get three points clear:
1) Interconnections: In the 4th millennium Egypt did have long
distance contact with the Near East and there is no question that early
Egypt valued raw materials from much further east. Even in the
Predynastic they valued lapis lazuli highly, which will have come from
northern Afghanistan to Egypt via overland or maritime trade routes.
This relationship was most likely over land via Sinai, the Levant and
Syria. In the 4th millennium Egypt had a cultural presence in the
southern Levant.
But the evidence favours connections to Susa in Iran, not necessarily
Uruk period Sumer in Mesopotamia.

The Egyptians had connections to Iran but not Sumer? Sumer and Iran
are neighboring countries. Susa is within walking distance of Sumer!
Andrea Sinclair should try looking at
a map.
And this long distance trade does not prove direct contact with any of the
intermediate cultures, but it infers the existence of trade routes and
movement of objects and people in both directions. It also infers they
could have seen each other’s visual idiom, particularly administrative
sealings. However, we have absolutely no archaeological evidence of
intercontinental wars or invasions.
Andrea Sinclair disagreed with me when I said the exact same thing.
2) The Hierakonpolis painting and the Gebel el Arak knife
Idiot about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/1049201.html
21 of 30 8/18/2020, 5:28 PM



Early ancient Egyptian iconography was complex and does not always
mirror the imagery they produced in the pharaonic period. However,
some important themes about power survived into the Bronze Age and
dominated state rhetoric, and they were formed in the Naqada period,
when both the knife and painting were made.
The most important of these were the use of battle, prisoner taking and
hunting scenes to show dominance over the forces of disorder. The forces
of disorder were always wild (not domestic) desert animals and human
enemies. These motifs were used in the Naqada period and the painting
and knife examples discussed here have them. Visual propaganda
representing the ruling powers conquering chaos was common to
Egyptian royal monuments and for high status tombs.
A battle scene doesn’t show a ruler conquering “disorder”, it shows him
conquering
his enemies.
Boating scenes were also dominant in both early and later Egyptian
funerary art. They painted these scenes of funerary barques and cult
festivals in rich tombs and temples. In the Naqada period they were also
de rigueur on funerary and cult vases ... usually with specific details like
pavilions, standards and palm fronds on the prows. Just like those that
are present on the knife and in the tomb painting. The flotilla of boats in
the Hierakonpolis painting is thought by experts to show a funerary or
ritual procession.

not palm fronds. The palm fronds on the six boats are “standards”,
insignia to show
that all the boats belong in the invasion fleet. Plus, six funeral boats in one
painting?
In the middle of a battle? Also, Andrea Sinclair doesn’t bother to explain
why there is
only one person on all six boats (it’s because all of the Sumerians are on
the shore,
attacking the Egyptians).
With three female figures on the largest boat who could be gods or cult
personnel.
They are not on the boat. They are standing on land behind the boat.
The posture and dress of the figures have parallels with the depiction of
female ritual figures at that time.
They are not female, and they are not ritual figures. Three of them are
shown carrying weapons. Is Andrea Sinclair suggesting they are Egyptian
Amazon warriors?

The boats on the painting and the knife are also pretty consistent with
Predynastic boat imagery, but I understand that the writer got around
that awkward issue by saying the Egyptian artists drew what they knew.
Many of the boats on the Gebel el-Arak knife are unmistakably Sumerian.
Finally, the master of animals on each of these examples is the main
argument for foreign influences or presence on the painting and the
knife, (high prowed boats being another), because the master of animals
was not a feature of pharaonic Egyptian iconography.
The Egyptians obviously knew about the Sumerian Master of Animals.
That is why he is unmistakably shown on both the Gebel el-Arak knife and
the Hierakonpolis painting.
Didn’t Andrea Sinclair just say people “could have seen each other’s visual
idiom,
particularly administrative sealings”? I explained why the Master of
Animals “was not
a feature of pharaonic Egyptian iconography”. It’s because he became the
symbol of
a foreign civilization.
But in the mid 4th millennium it was not an overly dominant motif in
Sumer either. It comes properly into vogue in Mesopotamia in the early
3rd millennium. In the 4th millennium it was a motif from Susa in Iran.
The Gebel el-Arak knife and the Hierakonpolis painting clearly show that
the Sumerian
Master of Animals was “in vogue” in the mid 4th millennium. Andrea
Sinclair will need to
show some proof to support her absurd claim that the iconic Sumerian
Master of Animals
originated in Iran. The shepherd kings of Sumer had been around since
the very beginning of Sumerian civilization (see The Kings of Uruk). A
shepherd is all about controlling animals,
yet Andrea Sinclair claims that the Sumerians needed to borrow the
Master of Animals
from the Iranians. It just goes to show that Andrea Sinclair knows nothing
about the Sumerians. Earlier, she complained about people who write
beyond their knowledge base

and experts in one area who don’t do the required amount of studying. It
sounds like
she is talking about herself.
Andrea Sinclair obviously didn’t spend more than five minutes trying to
discern a coherent
meaning for these two artifacts. She just spouts off random ideas as they
occur to her.
She’s just “shooting from the lip”, as it were. Listening to Andrea Sinclair
is like listening to
a drunken “know it all” in a bar. You can almost smell the beer on her
breath. She just
rambles on and on without saying anything at all.
In America, if someone is arrested for a DUI (Driving Under the
Influence), a breathalyzer is
affixed to their car that keeps the doors locked until the driver passes a
sobriety test.
Andrea Sinclair should have a breathalyzer installed on her computer.
3) Writing style: The language employed in this blog is problematic at
best. The choice of words has a distinctly black and white/primitive
versus civilised tone which contaminates both entire pieces. Nothing is
impartial about their writing.
Unlike Andrea Sinclair’s measured tone of judicious impartiality.
The writer employs an array of loaded modern American film-media
language to gleeful effect, such as ‘rustling’, `bad guys’, ‘homeland
defence’, ‘action hero’, ‘marines’, ‘soldiers’ and ‘seaborne invasion’. By
doing this they manipulate the perception of the reader in very
inappropriate directions.
“Bad guys”, and “action hero” are the only two movie terms in Andrea
Sinclair’s list. Compare this to Andrea Sinclair’s use of “film-media
language”: cowboy movies, vampire lord, cocky arse, “That's it boys,
saddle up the boats”[?], btw, oh oh, gotcha, totally chilled, seriously?, I
really need to lie down, eh?, muahaha, and “it was all just a dream”.
You’re a hypocrite, Andrea Sinclair.
Notice how Andrea Sinclair uses sarcasm and ridicule to make statements

that she
cannot support with facts. She sounds like a sophomoric Millennial who
adopts a
snotty tone of voice in a desperate attempt to be “cool”.
If you don’t want to read the originals, I will cut it down to essentials:
Andrea Sinclair couldn’t be bothered to study the originals, so why should
you?
The Egyptians were the bad guys and they wore creepy penis thingys.
This is further evidence that Andrea Sinclair doesn’t know how to read a
simple sentence.
I distinctly said the Sumerians were the bad guys, not the Egyptians.
... ‘For the record, the Sumerians never wore this ridiculous apparatus. It
was much too
primitive and barbaric for the Sumerians. In my opinion, it proves that
the Sumerians were
far more civilized than the Egyptians during this period of history.
There, I said it.
Someone had to say it.’
Yes, Andrea Sinclair, penis sheathes really are creepy and barbaric. That is
why
penis sheathes were discarded after the Egyptians became more civilized.
As for you, Andrea Sinclair: If you think penis sheathes are so great,
then picture your father in one.
.....
To sum up, as I said at the beginning, I would generally recommend
reading more widely before deciding it was a good idea to produce such
incoherent, longwinded and culturally ignorant trash, and then, to
publish them on the internet. However, it did give us a
running gag around the house for about 24 hours. A good hearty laugh
about rustling antelopes with your trusty pet lions is never a bad thing...
(edit) turns out we are still getting the odd laugh out of it.

It goes to show that everyone in Andrea Sinclair’s household is just as
ignorant as she is. Obviously, they didn’t actually read my pages. If they
had, they would have corrected Andrea Sinclair and saved her some
embarrassment. They could have prevented her from making a complete
fool of herself. They should have sat on her, if necessary, to keep her from
publishing her drunken tirade.
So, to close ... a word or two of advice. An uninformed opinion is pretty
much valueless to humanity, whether you are talking about history,
archaeology, politics or dental procedures ... Don’t publish it ... Another
basic rule of thumb for coherent historical reasoning is, if a reading
resource is more than 60 years old it is best to avoid relying on it.
I used the article published in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (Dec.
1962, by the authors Humphrey Case and Joan Crowfoot Payne) because it
is the most comprehensive treatment of the subject. I also studied more
recent sources, but they offered no new information (and apparently they
did little to edify Andrea Sinclair).
Equally, scrolling through pop history sites on the internet at 2am in the
morning is not a basis for sound research. These pieces of writing are
living proof of the pitfalls of these methods.
Andrea Sinclair
Idiot.
I truly believe that Andrea Sinclair’s drunken tirade is literally the worst
excuse for a scholarly paper that has ever been written. I mean it. It's the
worst “scholarly” paper that has ever been published in the entire history
of Western Civilization.
To use her own words, it is a shallowly researched, outdated, pseudo
intellectual bit of nonsense that is effectively dressed up to look like
‘educated’ critique. It is quite confusing
and wildly contradictory. It is rambling, incoherent, longwinded, and
culturally ignorant trash.
It is an uninformed opinion that is pretty much valueless to humanity.
I challenge the reader to name one single part of the preceding paragraph
that isn’t true.

Ms. Sinclair’s lack of insight and her numerous errors are bad enough, but
her snide tone
and her liberal use of unwarranted sarcasm means she comes across as
being both a smartass and a dumbass at the same time.
Here’s a tip for you, Andrea Sinclair: Before you adopt a snarky tone of
voice, make sure you have the facts on your side. Otherwise you’ll end up
looking like an obnoxious fool.
Andrea Sinclair is disgrace to Egyptology, a discredit to the University of
Melbourne, and an embarrassment to scholars everywhere.

In other words, Andrea Sinclair, you got nothing, absolutely nothing. You
can list all the references you want, they obviously didn’t do you a bit of
good. You have zero insight into understanding these artifacts. Zero.
For 100 years, scholars were unable to piece together a narrative of events
portrayed on the Hierakonpolis mural and the Gebel el-Arak knife,
because they did not know the context
of the stories. Within the context of a Sumerian invasion, everything about
the artifacts
makes sense. Without this context, nothing does.
I stand by my work. I’ll put it up against Andrea Sinclair’s drivel any day of
the year.
I’ve got an idea, Andrea Sinclair. Instead of using sarcasm and ridicule, if
you want to refute my findings, why don’t you try using facts? If you want
to discredit my interpretation of the events, try coming up with your own
interpretation. If (and only if) you can precisely describe everything that
is happening on both the Hierakonpolis painting and the Gebel el-Arak
knife,
as I do, then you can talk.
In the meantime, Andrea Sinclair, either put up or shut up.
