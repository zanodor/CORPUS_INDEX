Size / Distances
If the companion acted like a planet orbiting our sun, and the orbit
periodicity was close to the precession periodicity, then standard
calculations would put our binary counterpart somewhere between
848.5 AU and 1515 AU depending on its mass and eccentricity. For
detailed calculations under this scenario, please download the PDF

However, there are other possibilities, including the possibility that
the solar system itself is moving much faster than any of the planets
and therefore our companion star may be a nearby visible star.
While the solar system speed is difficult to measure (the question is
always “compared to what?”), astrophysicist Reg Cahill of Australia
has suggested that the solar system is moving in excess of 430km/s,
relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and this opens
the possibility that our solar system might be orbiting anyone of a
number of local stars, but more than likely one of the larger masses
that lies not too far inclined to the plane of the solar system. Such a
scenario might seem improbable given our current understanding of
gravity and visible star distances, however there are compelling
theories, such as MOND theory, and there is unusual evidentiary
information, such as the data from Voyager 1 and 2 or the anomalous
acceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft that make this
scenario attractive to investigation.



In addition to the odd behavior of distant satellites the most distant
dwarf planets also display the signature of a potential companion
star in their strange orbits. Mike Brown, Professor of Planetary
Astronomy at Caltech, and the discoverer of Sedna, said simply:
“Sedna shouldnʼt be there. ...Thereʼs no way to put Sedna where it is.
It never comes close enough to be affected by the Sun, but it never
goes far enough away from the Sun to be affected by other stars.”

Other astronomers, including John Matese, Emeritus Professor of
Physics at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and physicist
Daniel P. Whitmire, of the same institution, and Richard Muller of the
University of California Berkeley, have come to similar conclusions
(based mostly on comet data), albeit without correlating orbit
periodicity to the precession observable. Given such research we
urge the scientific community to keep an open mind on possible
forces that might be affecting the sunʼs motion, and in turn the
earthʼs orientation.
