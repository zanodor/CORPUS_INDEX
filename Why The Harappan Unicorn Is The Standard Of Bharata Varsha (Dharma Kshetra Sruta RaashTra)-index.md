Why The Harappan Unicorn
Is The Standard Of Bharata Varsha
( Dharma Kshetra/Sruta RaashTra)?
How The Jaina And Buddha Dharmas Testify To This Fact?
Abstract
Perhaps no other world language has as many words to denote
agni as Vedic Bharata(Sanskrit) has. No other religious text has as
many hymns praising agni as god as the Rg veda has.Vedic
sacrificial fire altars are seen in IVC especially along the
Gaggar(Garga-bull)-Hakra bed.The Harappan unicorn is the
symbol of Bharata Varsha/ DhRtaraashTra/ agnishToma sacrifice.
Ra(agni)-satra(saya-house,yaja-sacrifice) is rashTra(raajya/
desa/darsa/ dasra/ sarat/varsha , ).This paper opens up the
impact of Harappan vedic fire worship upon the historical Jaina
and Buddha religions to show the cultural continuity of Bharata
Varsha from IVC to the present.

Silver coin of a "King VRshNi" (of the Audumbaras according to Cunningham.Audumbara>Kuru/Rg/Dig-ambara.
Audumbaras
The Audumbras (Hindi;ओदुम्बर ;uru/Kuru/Puru-mahaa
great,nRpa-deva-raaja-king>mahaaraaja> viraaja> samraaja>
cakravartin>sarvabhauma> Mahadeva) or Audumbatiras were a
north Indian tribal nation east of the Punjab, in the Western



Himalaya region. They were the most important tribe of
the Himachal, and lived in the lower hills
between Sirmaur, Chamba and Yamuna.
They issued coinage from the 1st century BCE, when they
seemingly gained independence from the Indo-Greeks. The silver
coins of the Kunindas, the Vemakas and the Audumbaras closely
follow the coins of Apollodotus II in their characteristics (weight,
size and material). Their coins are found in the area
of Pathānkot, Gurdāspur District. Their favorite deities were
Mahā(agna/naga)deva or Siva, and also Kārtikeya, standing
with a spear in right hand cf. , (matsya>ma-astya>na
astya>na-satya>dasma>dasra>satra>yatna>madya>kasya), .
They appear in the Ganapatha of Panini of 5th Century B.C. K K
Das Gupta has attempted to show that they existed even in
Brahmana period. They were enterprising people having
prosperous trade and commerce(cf.Harappan trade with
Dilmun,Sumer etc.).
Their capital was Kotesvara(suurya-iisvara) or
Kachhesvara(cf.Garuda/aksha/saka-iisvara ). Kotesvara
was a celebrated place of pilgrimage on the western shore of
Kachh, close to Indus and to the great ocean. It is on the bank
of Kori(suurya) branch of Indus. There was a temple of Shiva
in the middle of city. The meaning of Kotesvara is 10 million
Ishvara.
Kachh is also called Rann of Kachh. The word Rann is evidently a
corruption of Irana(nR>Iisvara>king cf.Irinjalakkuda/
Ernakulam in Kerala,indicate nR KuTa/pura), which means a
salt land (Amarkosha). From the coins of 200 B.C. – 48 A.D. it



appears that for some time Audumbara were under Indo
Greek and after that under Kusanas. The Prakrit legends
Aduinvarisa – ‘of the Audumvara(cf.Bharata Varsha )’ appears
on the copper coins and pieces of Audumbara tribe in Punjab. The
word Audumvara refers either the people connected to the Fig
tree, Audumvara or where the tree was grown in abundance.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udumbara_(Buddhism)#/media/File:Ficus_racemosa_fr uctescence.jpg
Buddhist texts
The symbolism of unseen flowers of the uḍumbara can be found
in texts such as Theravada Buddhism's Uraga , ,



(Guru/ Kuru/ Varaha) Sutta (Sn 1.1, v. 5) and Mahayana
Buddhism's Lotus Sutra.
Sanskrit literature
According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, Vedic sacrifices used uḍumbara
wood for many different ritual purposes such as sacrificial
post, ladle, and amulets (Macdonell and Keith, Vedic Index,
s.v. uḍumbara)."
It is mentioned as the name for the Ficus racemosa in
the Atharvaveda, Taittiriya Samhita, Aitareya
Brahmana, Shatapatha Brahmana and the Mahabharata. In the
Hindu medical text, Sushruta Samhita, uḍumbara is a name given
to a type of leprosy with coppery spots. In other texts, it is a
measure that equals "two tolas"(cf.testament to the uses of
the padas/akshas for religious and vedic metrological
purposes).
Pali literature
In the Pali literature, the uḍumbara tree and its flowers are used
concretely (as the tree beneath which a former Buddha gained
enlightenment), metaphorically (as representative of a caste) and
symbolically (evoking the insubstantiality of things and self).



Location of the Audumbaras relative to other groups:
the Kunindas, the Vemakas, the Vrishnis, the Yaudheyas,
the Pauravas and the Arjunayanas.

Parsva/bhasvara. Obviously the first Jina is Kuru



Jina/sura/rusha. Varddhamaana is varsha/Bharata/desa
naama/maana which is Bharata varsha.Hence the first Jina is
Bharata/Paarsva/Paarthiva.
Bharatas were the Vedic tribe mentioned in Rgveda. The name
Bharata denote varsha/vaasa/vesha/desa/veda and the vedic
people who lived in the IVC, as mentioned in the Rgveda.The
nation of the Bharatas was called Bharata Varsha/Aryavarta/
Brahmavarta/ Kuru Varsha/Pancaala etc..
Agni, (Sanskrit: “Fire”) is the vedic fire-god , second only to
Indra in the Vedic texts of ancient IVC. He denote the fire of the
sun, of lightning, of the domestic and the sacrificial hearths,the
king,the priest , yajna etc.
Agni (Jina/Bharata , ; Pali; Aggi) appears in Jaina and
Buddhist texts, as both a god as well as a the element of fire. In
Pali literature, he is also called Aggi-Bhagavā, Jātaveda, and
Vessānara.
The meaning in RV 2.7.1 , 2.7.5 and 3.33.12 of the
word Bhaarata is not literally “descendant of Bharata”or the “Son of Bharata.”
The priests of the yajna who kindle Agni, are called Bharatas. The synonyms for priests are :
भरत ाः । कु रवाः । व घताः । वृक्तबर्हिषाः । यतुस्रचाः । मरुताः । सब धाः ।
देवयवाः इत्यष्ट वृत्विङ् न म र्न ।
“BharatAh(cf.RV.9.97.1); kuravah; vAghatah; vRktabarhishah; yatasrucah; marutah; sabAdhah; devayavah”
Since the priests kindle Agni, he is considered as their child. So,
Agni is the son of the priests, Bharatas (भरत ाः ). Hence, he is



called BhArata (भ रताः ) .The mantras of the Rg/gira/guru/kuru/hari veda were designed to praise agni in its various forms according to vedic dharma.

Agni(ashTa) is the chief god among the group known as Vasus and is the Principal god of the Vedas along with Indra.
His parents
were Dharma(Bharata/veda) and Vasubhārya (Daughter-oflight).He was also born from the mouth(mukha>sukha>nu
kha>su-kha;kha-sun,sky) of Brahma , (varaha-na/ma). His sister is Medhā (intelligence) and his wife is Svāhā (Invocation-at-offering). He had three sons named Pāvaka (Purifier), Pāvana (Purifying) and Śuci (Pure cf.pu-fire).
Agni is also called Soma . Agni is the consumer and Soma is the consumed. Agni is related to Indra who dwells in the atmospheric region as the thunder-bolt (lightning) and Vishnu in the Sun. Vishnu also abides in all beings as the inner digestive fire Vaiśvānara and Kaama -the fire of sex/procreation.
Temple walls in South India are painted with red and white stripes to denote agni and soma.
Agni was given the lordship of the southeast direction to denote
the noon sun of the day.
The Nāsadīya ( ná ásat, or "not the non-existent") Sūkta , also
known as the Hymn of Creation, is the 129th hymn of the 10th
mandala of the Rgveda (10:129). It is concerned
with cosmology and the origin of the universe.

There was no air then, nor the space beyond it. What covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping?
Was there then cosmic fluid, in depths
unfathomed?
2. Then there was neither death nor immortality

nor was there then the torch of night and day.
The One breathed windlessly and self-sustaining. There was that One then, and there was no other.
3. At first there was only darkness wrapped in
darkness.
All this was only unillumined cosmic water.
That One which came to be, enclosed in nothing, arose at last, born of the power of knowledge.
4. In the beginning desire descended on it
that was the primal seed, born of the mind.
The sages who have searched their hearts with wisdom
know that which is, is kin to that which is not.
5. And they have stretched their cord across the
void,
and know what was above, and what below. Seminal powers made fertile mighty forces.
Below was strength, and over it was impulse.
6. But, after all, who knows, and who can say
Whence it all came, and how creation happened? the gods themselves are later than creation,
so who knows truly whence it has arisen?
7. Whence all creation had its origin,
the creator, whether he fashioned it or whether he
did not, the creator, who surveys it all from highest heaven,
he knows — or maybe even he does no

Rig Veda 1.164.46 says that Indra, Agni, Mitra, Varuna, etc.
are the names of Brahman(prahna sun).
The name Bhārata or Bhārata-varṣa (Bharata-varsha) is said to be
derived from the name of either Dushyanta's son Bharata or
Rshabha's son Bharata. Several Puranas state that it is derived
from the name of Bharata, the son of Rshabha.

Bharatas is found in the Rg veda and the Adi Parva of the
Mahabharata, where he is mentioned as the son of Dushyanta
and Sakuntala.
Bharat is the name given to India. It originates from the Sanskrit word "Bharata" which stands for 'Agni' . Aryavarta was the name for the IVC region of India.

Bharatas were Kusikas !
" This Devarata(cf.devaraaja-Indra), is your master (man) ;
follow him, ye Kusikas ! (The Mahabhisheka or Grand lnauguration/Anointing Ceremony of Indra.The Elevation of Indra to the Royalty over the Gods. His Throne-seat.By Brihat Mantras he Ascended it. The Gods Proclaim Him as King by mentioning all his Titles) Now follows the Great Inauguration {mahabhisheka) of Indra. The gods, headed by Prajapati, said to one another (pointing with their hands to Indra) : " This one is among the gods the most vigorous, most strong, most valiant, most perfect, who



carries out best any work (to be done). Let us install him (to the kingship over us)." They all consented to perform just this ceremony (mahabhisheka) on Indra. They brought for him that
throne-seat, which is Rg(hari/puru/kuru/Unicorn , )formed. They made the Brihat and Rathantara verses its two
fore-legs , ,
,,
the Vairupa and Vairaja verses its hind-legs, the Sakvara and Raivata (verses) its top boards, the Naudhasa and Kaleya its side-boards. The Rg verses were made the threads of the texture(kali varsha/vatsara/ vastra/ushTra/vishTara , ) which went lengthwise, the Samans were the threads which went cross ways, the Yajus verses the intervals in the texture. They made fthe goddess of Glory its covering, and the goddess of fortune its pillow, Savitar and BRhaspati were holding its two fore-legs, Vayu and Pusan the two hind-legs, Mitra and Varuna the two top-boards(pillows), the Asvins the two side-boards(armrests).

Indra then ascended the throne-seat, addressing it thus : " May the Vasus(cf.ashTavasus-4 couples in the cart) ascend thee with the Gayatri metre, with the Trivrit Stoma, with
the Rathantara Sama. After them I then ascend for obtaining universal sovereignty(sarva damana). May the Rudras(rushara/vatsara) ascend thee with the Trishtubh metre,the
fifteen-fold Stoma, and the Brihat Sama. After them then I ascend for obtaining increase of enjoyment. May the Adityas ascend thee with the Jagati metre, the seventeen- fold Stoma, and the Vairupa Sama. After them I ascend for obtaining independent rule. May the Visve Devah ascend thee with the Anushtubh metre, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and the Vairaja Sama. After them I ascend for obtaining distinguished rule. May the divine Sadhyas and Aptyas ascend thee with the Pankti metre, the Trinava (twenty-seven- fold cf.praNavaaum;praNaya-love) Stoma, and the Sakvara Sama. After
them I ascend for obtaining royal power. May the divine Maruts and Angiras ascend thee with the Atichandas metre; the thirty-three-fold(cf.dvi-ravi-srii) Stoma, and the Raivata
Saama. After them, then, I ascend for obtaining the fulfilment of the highest desires for becoming a great king,for supreme mastership, independence, and a long residence. By these words, one should ascend the throne-seat. After Indra had seated himself on this throne-seat, the Visve Devah said to him, " Indra cannot achieve any feat if he is not everywhere publicly proclaimed as hero ; but if he be thus proclaimed, he can do so." They then consented to do so, and consequently, turning towards Indra, cried aloud (calling him by all his titles.)



The gods bestowed on him (Indra,sovereign), by proclaiming him as "samrat(universal ruler;somraja,samvtsara, varsha, raashTra)," universal rule ; by proclaiming him as "bhokta(enjoyer of pleasures)," they made him father (of pleasures) ; by proclaiming him as " svaraj (independent ruler)," they granted him independence of rule ; by proclaiming him as "virat(distinguished king)," they conferred on him royal distinction; by proclaiming him " rajan(king)," rajapitR (they made him father of kings) ; by calling him " prameshTha(one who has attained the highest desires)," they granted him fulfilment of the highest desires. The king is inaugurated as the father/bhartR/somapa/pater/

this: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil.'" The eucharist , is the body of the son/sun of god given as food. (The gods then continued proclaiming his heroic virtues in the following manner) : " The Kshatra(saka-ratha/sahasra/saghasra;kshetra ) is born ; the Kshatriya is born ; the supreme master of the whole creation is born ; the devourer of the (hostile) tribes is born ; the destroyer of the hostile castles is born ;the slayer of the Asuras is born ; the protector of the Brahma is born ;the protector of the religion is born."
Heroic deeds of the kings were praised and if not real ones were there,those were fabricated and praised!

4 Closely was Gayatri conjoined with Agni , , , and closely Savitar combined with Usnih. Brilliant with Ukthas, Soma joined Anushtup: Brhaspati's voice by BRhati was aided. 5 Viraj adhered to Varuna and Mitra: here Trishtup day by day was Indra's portion. Jagati entered all the Gods together: so by this knowledge men were raised to Rshis. 6 So by this knowledge men were raised to Rshis, when ancient sacrifice sprang up, our Fathers. With the mind's eye I think that I behold them who first performed this sacrificial worship. 7 They who were versed in ritual and metre(cf.maana/chandas/gaana), in hymns and rules, were

Jainism-Tiirthankaras

Tiirthankara(sruta-karaNa/marga) , its own group of 24
(cf.Horas of day/pakshas of year) Tiirthankaras (Sanskrit:
“Ford-maker”) also called Jina (“Victor”;sura-sun,jna-scholar ,
, ), in Jainism, a saviour who has succeeded in crossing
over life’s stream of rebirths and has made a path for others to
follow. Mahavira (6th century BCE cf.maha/naga,viira/ravi/agni)
was the last Tirthankara to appear. According to tradition,
his predecessor, Parsvanatha(Rshabha/prabhata,naatha/raja),
lived about 250 years earlier., the first of whom—if it is an age of
descending purity—are giants, but they decrease in stature and
appear after shorter intervals of time as the age proceeds.



In art the Tiirthankara is represented either standing stiffly in the pose known as kayotsarga(“dismissing the body”

Triratna
Buddhism and Jainism



Triratna, (Sanskrit: “Three Jewels”) Pali Ti-ratana, also
called Threefold Refuge, in Buddhism the
Triratna comprises the Buddha, the dharma (doctrine, or
teaching), and the sangha (the monastic order, or
community). One becomes a Buddhist by saying the words “I go
to the Buddha for refuge, I go to the Doctrine for refuge, I go to the
Order for refuge.”
In Jainism the three jewels (also referred to as ratnatraya) are
understood as samyagdarshana (“right
faith”), samyagjnana (“right knowledge”),
and samyakcharitra (“right conduct”). One of the three cannot
exist exclusive of the others, and all are required for spiritual
liberation. The Triratna is symbolized frequently in art as a
trident , , .The continuity in the use of the vedic
Bharata symbols from IVC by the later Jina and Buddha
religions shows that the IVC symbols were meant for vedic
religious use as still used in modern Hinduism .
Svetambara/Digambara
Svetambara (Sanskrit: “White-robed,” or “White-clad” , ,
;su-veda>sveta) is one of the two main sects of Jainism, a religion of India. The monks and nuns of the Svetambara sect
wear white garments (cf.white robes of VasishThas/Christian priests). This is in contrast to the practice followed by the parallel sect, the Digambara (“Sky-clad”;Rgambara/nRpa), which does not admit women into the ascetic order and whose monks are always nude(nagna/najina/jna/agna/hari/dig/Rg).Both sects denote allegiance to the vedic dharma.

Parshvanatha
Credits:Statue-Parshvanatha.jpg (1600×1200) (britannica.com)
Parshvanatha(PRthu-agni) was the first Tiirthankara ,said to have
lived about 250 years before Mahaviira, the last Tiirthankara,
who, died in 527 BCE.
Parshvanatha is often associated with serpents. In sculpture and
painting he is always identified by a canopy of snake hoods over
his head(cf.Vishnu , , , ).
Arishtanemi
Jaina saint
Arishtanemi(cf.kaalacakra/Kaalanemi/Dasaraaja/Dasaratha/Cak

(cf.2+2>4>turiiya>tuurya>suurya ) of the
24 Tiirthankaras (“Ford-maker,” i.e., saviour;srutakaraNa)
of Jainism, a traditional religion of India.
He is believed to have been the contemporary and cousin of
the Hindu god KRshNa (kaala/syaama/ samaya).
Legend holds that on his wedding day, Arishtanemi heard the



cries of animals being slaughtered for the marriage feast and
immediately renounced the world. Arishtanemi (“the rim –nemiof whose wheel is unhurt arishta” cf.arishTa>sruta>citra>s
RshTi>d-RshTi , , cf. wheel of black jewels). In paintings
of the Svetambara sect, Arishtanemi always appears black (in
paintings of the Digambara sect, he is blue ). His symbol is the
conch , m311a (cf.Pancajanya of
KRshNa/kaala/syaama/samaya/tanaya/syena/yajna
, , ).
mahāpuruṣa
Indian religion
Mahāpuruṣa, (Sanskrit: “great man”, cf.mahaa
waterbuffaloe,purusha-man) also called Śalākāpuruṣa
(salaka>salka>kalasa>cakra>sakra , , , , , ,
), in Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist belief, an individual of
extraordinary destiny, distinguished by certain physical traits or
marks (lakṣanas). Such men are born to become either universal
rulers (cakravartins , , ) or great spiritual leaders
(such as Buddhas or the Jaina spiritual leaders, the Tiirthankaras).
Jainism honours 54(turiiya-suurya-4;saka-agna-aksha-garuda
5;5+4>nava>rava-sun) “great souls” (also called śalākāpuruṣas).
They include the 24 Tiirthankaras (“Ford-Makers”),
12 cakravartins (“world conquerors”), 9 Vāsudevas
(counterparts of the Hindu god KRshNa), and 9 Baladevas
(counterparts of the Hindu god Balarāma).

Siddha(siirsha/siras/tiirtha)
Vajrayāna siddha, in Jainism, is one who has achieved perfection. By right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct a



siddha has freed himself from the cycle of rebirths and resides in a state of perpetual bliss in the siddha-śīlā, at the top of the universe. The siddha and the other ascetics constitute the pañca-parameṣṭhin, the five
chief divinities of the Jainas. Their figures are represented on a silver or brass tray called a siddha-cakra (saint-wheel), to which great sanctity and magical power are attributed. In the twiceyearly ceremony known as oḷī, the images are washed and anointed, and offerings of rice, sweetmeats, and fruit are made. In the Digambara sect the saint-wheel is called navapada (“nine
dignities,” or “nine virtues”) and consists of the pañca
parameṣṭhin plus the Jina (saviour) image, temple, scriptures,
and dharma-cakra (sacred wheel of the law).

Pali chakkavatti, the world ruler, derived from Sanskrit cakra,
“wheel/sa-arka(god-sun),” and vartin, “one who turns.”
Buddhist and Jain sources distinguish three types
of secular Cakravartin: cakravala cakravartin, a king who rules
over all four of the continents posited by ancient Indian
cosmography (i.e., a universal monarch); dvipa cakravartin, a
ruler who governs only one of those continents and is, therefore,
less powerful than the first; and pradesha cakravartin, a
monarch who leads the people of only a part of a continent, the
equivalent of a local king. The first reference to a secular king who
achieved the status of a Cakravala chakravartin appears in texts
and monuments from the Mauryan dynasty that praise the
exploits of King Ashoka (3rd century BCE). In Buddhism,
the Cakravartin was considered to be the secular counterpart of a
Buddha (“enlightened one”).

Ficus religiosa
The sacred fig is considered to have a religious significance in the
three major religions of India, Hinduism, Buddhism and
Jainism. Jainism is similar to Buddhism. It was founded
by Vardhamana Jnatiputra or Nataputta Mahavira (599-527 BC),
called Jina (Spiritual Conqueror), a contemporary of Buddha.
Ficus religiosa or sacred fig is a species of fig native to the Indian
subcontinent and Indochina that belongs to Moraceae, the fig or
mulberry family. It is also known as the Bodhi tree (pu-dhi>
Pushya> pu-saya>ra-saya>rajya/Soma/ Noon; pu>ra> agni),
Pippala(cf.vipra-scholar,Brahmana,jina) tree, Peepul
tree, Peepal tree, Pipal tree, or Asvattha tree (in India and
Nepal). Hindu and Jain ascetics consider the species to be sacred
and often meditate under it. This is the tree under which Gautama
Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.
F. religiosa has a very long lifespan, living for over 3,000 years.
Some trees have been reported to be more than 2,000 years old,
like the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, a peepal tree in the ancient city
of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka which is estimated to be more than
2,250 years old and is regarded as the "Oldest historical tree in
the world with religious importance".

The earliest known record of Ficus religiosa in human culture is
the use of peepal leaf motifs in the pottery of the Helmand culture,
found at Mundigak site, in Kandahar, Afghanistan, dating back to
third millenium BCE.
The peepal tree is considered sacred by the followers of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. In the Bhagavad
Gita(ch.10), KRshNa says, "I am the Peepal tree , ,
, , , , , , ,among the trees, Narada among the Deva Rshi (Divine sages), BhRgu among the SapthaMaharshis, Citraratha among the Gandharvas, And sage Kapila among the Siddhas."
Buddhism
Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment (Bodhi cf.buddhi
intelligence;druu-tree,sruu-veda,vRksha-tree,prakaasa-light)
while meditating underneath a Ficus religiosa. The site is in
present-day Bodh Gaya in Bihar, India. A branch of the original



tree was rooted in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka in 288 BCE and is
known as Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi; it is the oldest living human
planted tree in the world.
In Theravada(Drupada , >sru-pada>srii pada>sriimad>
guru pada>prabhaata) Buddhist Southeast Asia, the tree's
massive trunk is often the site of Buddhist or animist shrines.
Hinduism
Sadhus (Hindu ascetics) still meditate beneath sacred fig trees,
and Hindus do pradakshina (circumambulation, or meditative
pacing) around the sacred fig tree as a mark of worship. Usually
seven(asva-sapta-saptasva) pradakshinas are done around the
tree in the morning time chanting "vriksha rajaya namah",
meaning "salutation to the king of trees". It is claimed that the 27
stars (constellations) constituting 12 houses (rasis) and 9 planets
are specifically represented precisely by 27 trees—one for each
star. The Bodhi Tree is said to represent Pushya (Western star
name γ, δ and θ Cancri in the Cancer constellation).
Plaksa(vRksha/prakaasa/pa-raksha/u-Rg-sa) is a possible
Sanskrit term for Ficus religiosa. However, according
to Macdonell and Keith (1912), it denotes the wavy-leaved fig tree
(Ficus infectoria) instead. In Hindu texts, the Plaksa tree is
associated with the source of the Sarasvati River. The Skanda
Purana states that the Sarasvati originating from the water



pot of Brahma , flows from Plaksa on the Himalayas.
According to Vamana Purana 32.1-4, the Sarasvati was rising from
the Plaksa tree (Pipal tree). Plaksa Pra-sravana denotes the
place where the Sarasvati appears. In the Rigveda Sutras, Plaksa
Pra-sravana refers to the source of the Sarasvati.

Bharata, Bhārata, Bharatā, Bharaṭa
1) Bharata (भरत) refers to an “actor” and represents a member of a theatrical part according to the Nāṭyaśāstra chapter 35. Accordingly, “as he alone conducts as the
leader the performance of a play by acting in many roles and playing many instruments
and by providing many accessories, he is called Bharata”.
Note: The term “Bharata” seems to have originally meant those who sang ballads connected with the heroic exploits of the Bharata race. The term ‘Bharthari’ meaning
singers on the exploits of Bhartṛhari a prince who renounced the world and attained
spiritual eminence, is analogous to Bharata. The Bharata ballads were the nucleus of the
Mahābhārata according to the hypothesis of Winternitz, such ballads gave rise to drama.
See in this connexion the author’s Contributions to the History of Hindu Drama,
Calcutta, 1957, pp. 15ff.



2) Bhārata (भ रत) refers to one of the four “ways of using weapons” (releasing missiles); it is a Sanskrit technical defined in the Nāṭyaśāstra chapter 11. These ‘ways’ are known
as nyāya and arise out of the various cārīs (‘dance-steps’).
(Instructions of Bhārata): “Putting forward the shield with the left hand and taking the
weapon the actor should walk about on the stage. Stretching the hand forward fully and
then drawing it back he should move the shield at his back from side to side and flourish the weapon around his head, and it should also be turned round [about the wrist] near
the cheek. And again the hands holding the weapon and the shield should be flourished
gracefully around the head”.
Purana and Itihasa (epic history)

1) Bharata (भरत):—Son of Daśaratha (son of Aja) . He was an incarnation who
appeared to his father in the form of a son. (see Bhāgavata Purāṇa 9.10.2)
2) Bharata (भरत):—Son of Duṣmanta (son of Rebhi). After performing a sacrifice called
the marut-stoma, he was granted a son by the Maruts (demigods). He was named
Bharadvāja. (see Bhāgavata Purāṇa 9.20.24)
Source: Wisdom Library: Varāha-purāṇa
1) Bharata (भरत).—Son of Ṛṣabha, who was the son of Nābhi, according to the Varāhapurāṇa chapter 74. Nābhi was a son of Medhātithi, a grandson of Svāyambhuva Manu, who was created by Brahmā, who was in turn created by
Nārāyaṇa, the unknowable all-pervasive primordial being. Bharata obtained from
Ṛṣabha the region called Bhārata (which lies south of Hemādri). Bharata had a son
named Sumati who inherited his kingdom when Bharata retired to the forest.
2) Bhārata (भ रत) is the name of a region situated on the southern side of mount Meru,
according to the Varāhapurāṇa chapter 75. Meru is one of the seven mountains located
in Jambūdvīpa, which is ruled over by Āgnīdhra, a grandson of Svāyambhuva Manu, who was created by Brahmā, who was in turn created by Nārāyaṇa, the unknowable all
pervasive primordial being.
Bhārata is divided in nine regions:
Indra,
Kaseru,
Tāmravarṇa,
Gabhasti,



Nāgadvīpa,
Saumya,
Gandharva,
Vāruṇa,
Bhārata.
Each is surrounded by an ocean (sāgara) and is one thousand yojanas in extent.
There are also seven major mountains (kulaparvata) found in Bhārata:
Mahendra,
Malaya,
Sahya,
Śuktimān,
Ṛkṣa,
Vindhya,
Pāriyātra.
The Varāhapurāṇa is categorised as a Mahāpurāṇa, and was originally composed of
24,000 metrical verses, possibly originating from before the 10th century. It is
composed of two parts and Sūta is the main narrator.

4) Bharata (भरत).—A sage and the famous author of Nāṭyaśāstra. He was a critic who lived around the year 400 B.C. His book on Nāṭyaśāstra (Histrionics) is world famous. Kālidāsa in the second act of his drama, Vikramorvaśīya states that this Bharata used to coach the devas in the art of acting. Nāṭyaśāstra is a book comprising thirtyseven
chapters dealing with the art of dance and music. He has written in detail about the four
Alaṃkāras, Upamā, Dīpaka, Rūpaka and Yamaka and also about the ten requisites of a Kāvya. He has not forgotten to write about the defects and demerits of Kāvya also. Commentaries on Nāṭyaśāstra have been written by lions in the profession: Mitragupta, Harṣavardhana, Śaṅkuka, Udbhaṭa, Bhaṭṭanāyaka and Abhinavagupta. Of these 'Abhinavabhāratī' the commentary written by Abhinavagupta is the only one freely
available now.
5) Bharata (भरत).—The Mahābhārata speaks about a few other Bharatas who were sons of Agni. Śamyu is a son of Agni known as Bharata. This Bharata has got another name, Ūrjja. (Śloka 6, Chapter 219, Vana Parva, Mahābhārata). There is an Agni of name Bharata with a son named Bhārata. When this Agni is propitiated one gets healthy and strong and so this Agni is called Puṣṭimān also. (Śloka 7, Chapter 219, Vana Parva,
Mahābhārata). There is another Bharata son of an Agni called Adbhuta. It is this Agni
that burns dead bodies. As this Agni lives permanently in Agniṣṭoma Yajñas; it gets the
name of Niyata also. (Śloka 6, Chapter 222, Vana Parva, Mahābhārata).
6) Bhārata (भ रत).—(MAHĀBHĀRATA). An epic written by Vyāsa. General
information. The Mahābhārata is an epic. Bharata(agni) is acclaimed as the first
emperor of Bhārata. The theme of this great epic is the fight between the two lines of
princes belonging to the dynasty of Bharata. That is why the book is called
Mahābhārata. The great size of the volume and the greatness of the wisdom contained therein have contributed much to its getting the name, Mahābhārata. Once the devas put the Mahābhārata in one pan of a balance and the Vedas in the other pan. Then the devas were convinced that the Mahābhārata weighed more than all the Vedas put together. (Ślokas 269-271, Chapter 1, Ādi Parva, Mahābhārata).* This book contains over a lakh of verses. There is no subject on earth which is not dealt with in the Mahābhārata. None of the world’s epics is so big as Mahābhārata. In size the Mahābhārata is double that of Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey put together. The following poem about it is worth
mentioning now:
7) Bhārata (भ रत).—(Bhāratavarṣa. India).
The purāṇas describe the Earth to be constituted of seven continents: Jambūdvīpa, Plakṣadvīpa, Śālmalīdvīpa, Kuśadvīpa, Krauñcadvīpa, Śākadvīpa and Puṣkaradvīpa. Of these India is Jambūdvīpa.

Bharata (भरत) refers to one of the four sons of Daśaratha who is the grandson of Raghu,
according to the Vaṃśānucarita section of the 10th century Saurapurāṇa: one of the
various Upapurāṇas depicting Śaivism.—Accordingly, [...] Raghu was the son of
Dīrghabāhu. The son of Raghu was very famous from whom Daśaratha was born. Daśaratha had four sons who were religious and famous in the world. They were Rāma, Bharata, Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna. All of them were devoted to Lord Mahādeva. [...] When Rāma was about to be consecrated, his step mother Kaikeyī asked for two boons to Daśaratha to grant which he promised earlier. As a result Bharata became the king, Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa were sent to the forest along with Sītā.



The Purana (पुर ण, purāṇas) refers to Sanskrit literature preserving ancient India’s vast
cultural history, including historical legends, religious ceremonies, various arts and
sciences. The eighteen mahapuranas total over 400,000 shlokas (metrical couplets) and

Vaishnava (वैष्णव , vaiṣṇava) or vaishnavism (vaiṣṇavism) represents a tradition of
Hinduism worshipping Vishnu as the supreme Lord. Similar to the Shaktism and
Shaivism traditions, Vaishnavism also developed as an individual movement, famous for
its exposition of the dashavatara (‘ten avatars of Vishnu’).
Shaivism (Shaiva philosophy)
Source: Wisdom Library: Śaivism
Bhārata (भ रत) refers to one of the seven regions (navakhaṇḍa) situated
within Jambūdvīpa, according to Parākhyatantra 5.61. It is also known as Bhāratakhaṇḍa. Jambūdvīpa is one of the seven continents situated within the world of
the earth (pṛthivī). These continents are located above the seven pātālas and may contain even more sub-continents within them, are round in shape, and are encircled
within seven concentric oceans.
According to the Parākhyatantra, “to the south of that is the landmass Bhārata, like the
landmass Hari. Here the suffering was borne (bhṛta) by Bharata because of his sons,who
followed bad paths”.
In the middle of these nine regions (e.g., Bhārata) is situated the golden mountain
named Meru which rises above the surface of the earth by 84,000 yojanas while it
penetrates the circle of the earth to a depth of sixteen yojanas.
The Parākhyatantra is an old Śaiva-siddhānta tantra dating from before the 10th
century.

Bharata (भरत) or Bharatāgama refers to one of upāgamas (supplementary scriptures) of
the Prodgītāgama which is one of the twenty-eight Siddhāntāgama: a classification of
the Śaiva division of Śaivāgamas. The Śaivāgamas represent the wisdom that has come down from lord Śiva, received by Pārvatī and accepted by Viṣṇu. The purpose of revealing upāgamas (e.g., Bharata Āgama) is to explain more elaborately than that of mūlāgamas (e.g., Prodgīta-āgama) and to include any new idea if not dealt in mūlāgamas.
Shaiva (शैव, śaiva) or Shaivism (śaivism) represents a tradition of Hinduism worshiping

Kavya (poetry)
Source: Wisdom Library: Kathāsaritsāgara



Bharata (भरत) is the younger brother of Rāma, both sons of Daśaratha, the king of Ayodhyā, according to in the Kathāsaritsāgara, chapter 51. Accordingly, “... long ago king Daśaratha, the sovereign of Ayodhyā, had a son named Rāma, the elder brother of
Bharata, Śatrughna and Lakṣmaṇa. He was a partial incarnation of Viṣṇu for the
overthrow of Rāvaṇa, and he had a wife named Sītā, the daughter of Janaka, the lady of
his life. As fate would have it, his father handed over the kingdom to Bharata, and sent
Rāma to the forest with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa”.
The story of Bharata was narrated by the Vidyādharī Kāñcanaprabhā to Naravāhanadatta while in a Svayambhū temple of Śiva, in order to demonstrate that “people who possess firmness endure for a long time mutual separation to which no termination is assigned”, in other words, that “heroic souls endure separation for so long a time”.
The Kathāsaritsāgara (‘ocean of streams of story’), mentioning Bharata, is a famous
Sanskrit epic story revolving around prince Naravāhanadatta and his quest to become
the emperor of the vidyādharas (celestial beings). The work is said to have been an
adaptation of Guṇāḍhya’s Bṛhatkathā consisting of 100,000 verses, which in turn is part
of a larger work containing 700,000 verses.

composer of NS, which is a treatise on Dramaturgy. His also the one of the eighteen

Kavya (क व्य , kavya) refers to Sanskrit poetry, a popular ancient Indian tradition of
literature. There have been many Sanskrit poets over the ages, hailing from ancient
India and beyond. This topic includes mahakavya, or ‘epic poetry’ and natya, or
‘dramatic poetry’.
Nirukta (Sanskrit etymology)
Source: Shodhganga: The significance of the mūla-beras (nirukta)
Bharata is commonly explained as an acronym composed of the first letters
of bhāva, rāga, and tāla; and the suffix nāṭyam in Tamil means dance. The two terms,
“nāṭya” and “bharata” were combined to make the term Bharatanatyam. This classical
dance tradition found a new form and structure in Tamilnadu in the 16th and 17th



centuries. Bhagavati is of the opinion that the word bharata generally refers to a class of
dancers. Siva, the lord of dance, taught abhinaya to one of his disciples, Tandu, who
taught this art to sage Bharata.

Bhārata (भ रत) refers to the land of India, according to Tantric texts such as the
Kubjikāmata-tantra, the earliest popular and most authoritative Tantra of the Kubjikā cult.—Accordingly, “[...] The Virgin (goddess) (kumārikā) established her fame in the land of Bhārata (in this way) and so the meritorious and holy Region of the Virgin (kaumārikākhaṇḍa) came into being”.
Note: The Svacchandabhairavatantra also refers to the Land of Bhārata i.e. India as that
of the Virgin, although it is not associated with her Yoni. According to the cosmology of
the Svacchandabhairavatantra (cf. Tantrāloka chapter eight) there are eight continents.



Each of them lies beyond one of eight mountain chains that surround mount Meru in the
centre. Bhārata is to the south of the Himalayan chain, which is itself south of Meru and
is shaped like a bow. It differs from the other continents because the beings who inhabit
most of it can only experience pleasure and pain (bhoga) and not produce Karma.
Bhārata is divided into nine islands, separated from one another by seas. The island closest to the Himalayas is called Kumārikā. This is India. Of all the parts of the continent of Bhārata, this is where Karma is created and destroyed.

General definition (in Hinduism) Source: Apam Napat: Indian Mythology



1) Bharata was one of the most illustrious kings of the Chandra dynasty, which was also
referred to as the Bharata dynasty from his time. He was the son of Dushyanta and
Shakuntala. He showed an aptitude for war from an early age and even defeated his father when he was still a boy. That story is told here. He had many sons but he did not
find any of them worthy of succeeding him. Therefore, he performed a great Yagna and
a son named Bhumanyu was born to him. Bhumanyu was the successor to Bharata.
2) Bharata is the son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya and his second queen Kaikeyi. His
father wanted to crown Rama, his eldest son (by his first wife Kausalya), but Kaikeyi
intervened and got him to make Bharata his heir-apparent. Rama was also sent on an
exile for fourteen years to the forest, accompanied by his wife Sita and his brother
Laxmana. Dasharatha died of grief.
3) Bharata was a King of the Solar dynasty, the son of Dhruvasandhi and an ancestor of
Rama. His son is Asita.

1) In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Bharata was the second brother of the main protagonist
Rama, and the son of Dasaratha and Kaikeyi. Dasaratha was the emperor of Ayodhya and belonged to the Suryavansha or Solar Dynasty. It is said that after Rama, he was the
symbol of dharma and idealism. A few commentators, however, deem Bharata to be
even greater than Rama himself in virtue. He is considered to be born in the aspect of
the Sudarshana Chakra, the most famous of Vishnu's Panchayudhas.

the twin rivers Gaṅgā and Sindhu.

1) Bharata (भरत) and Brāhmī were born as twins from Sunandā (one of Ṛṣabha’s wifes), according to chapter 1.2 [ādīśvara-caritra] of Hemacandra’s 11th century Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra (“lives of the 63 illustrious persons”): a Sanskrit epic poem
narrating the history and legends of sixty-three important persons in Jainism.
Accordingly, “[...] when a little less than six pūrvas had passed after the wedding, while the Lord enjoyed himself with them, the Jīvas of Bāhu and Pīṭha fell from Sarvārthasiddhi and entered Sumaṅgalā’s womb as twins. Likewise the jīvas of Subāhu and Mahāpīṭha fell from Sarvārthasiddhi and entered Sunandā’s womb. [...] Sumaṅgalā bore children, Bharata and Brāhmī, as the east bears the sun and (morning) twilight lighting up the quarter of the sky”.
2) Bharata (भरत) (or Bhāratakṣetra, Bhāratavarṣa) refers to one of the seven zones of
Jambūdvīpa which is situated in the “middle world” (madhyaloka), according to chapter
2.2.
Accordingly:—“Now, there are 7 zones here in Jambūdvīpa: Bhārata, Haimavata,
Harivarṣa, Videha, Ramyaka, Hairaṇyavata, and Airāvata from south to north. Making



the division between these there are 7 mountain-ranges, bounding the zones: Himavat,
Mahāhimavat, Niṣadha, Nīla, Rukmin, and Śikharin with equal diameter at the base and top. [...] In the zone named Bhārata there are the great rivers, Gaṅgā and Sindhu; [...] The first of each pair flows to the east and the second to the west. [...]”.
Source: Encyclopedia of Jainism: Tattvartha Sutra 3: The Lower and middle worlds
Bharata (भरत) or Bhāratavarṣa refers to a region of Jambūdvīpa: the first continent of
the Madhya-loka (middle-word), according to the 2nd-century Tattvārthasūtra 3.10. It
is named after supreme lord (cakravarti) Bharata. The Bharata region is surrounded by
Himavāna Mount in the north, and an ocean in the south, east and west directions. Bhāratakṣetra is divided in six subcontinents by the Vijayārdha Mountain range in the
middle and the rivers Ganga and Sindhu flowing from north to south. The mountain
chain Himavana separates the Bharata and Haimavata regions. Gaṅga and Sindhu rivers
divide Bharata-kṣetra.
Bharata, Airāvata and Videha except Uttarakuru and Devakuru are the regions of
labour i.e. where spiritual effort is possible also. There are 15 regions of labour in
the Two-and-half continents (dhāi-dvīpa) namely; five in Bharata, five in Airāvata
and five in Videha regions. The region where the inhabitants engage themselves in the
six activities /occupations are called region of labour. The Human beings living in the
regions of labour are called inhabitants of the region of labour (karmabhūmija).
Jambūdvīpa (containing the Bharata region) is in the centre of all continents and oceans; all continents and oceans are concentric circles with Jambūdvīpa in the centre. Like the navel is in the centre of the body, Jambūdvīpa is in the centre of all continents and oceans. Sumeru Mount is in the centre of Jambūdvīpa. It is also called Mount Sudarśana.
Jainism is an Indian religion of Dharma whose doctrine revolves around harmlessness
(ahimsa) towards every living being. The two major branches (Digambara and
Svetambara) of Jainism stimulate self-control (or, shramana, ‘self-reliance’) and
spiritual development through a path of peace for the soul to progess to the ultimate
goal.

In Hinduism
Vastushastra (architecture)
Source: Wisdom Library: Vāstu-śāstra
Fire (अनि, agni) is one of the five primary elements (pañcabhūta) forming the basic components of the world, according to Vāstu-śāstra literature. It is because of the
presence and balance of these five elements that our planet thrives with life.



Vastushastra (व ुस्तश स्त्र , vāstuśāstra) refers to the ancient Indian science (shastra) of
architecture (vastu), dealing with topics such architecture, sculpture, town-building,
fort building and various other constructions. Vastu also deals with the philosophy of
the architectural relation with the cosmic universe.
Shilpashastra (iconography)

Agni.—This is represented in two varieties according as it is used as a weapon of war or
employed for the purpose of making offerings.
Source: Shodhganga: The significance of the mūla-beras (śilpa)
1) Agni (अनि) refers to one of the several “attributes” (āyudha) or “accessories” of a
detiy commonly seen depicted in Hindu iconography, defined according to texts dealing
with śilpa (arts and crafs), known as śilpaśāstras.—Agni is represented in two varieties,
according to whether it is used as a weapon of war or employed for the purpose of
making offerings. Agni also represents “containment”, referring to one of the attributes of Lord Śiva.
2) Agni (अनि) also refers to one of the Aṣṭadikpālaka (“eight guardians of the
direction”).—The hand poses for the eight dikpālas (guardians of directions) are
described in the Abhinayadarpaṇa and they are followed in the dance performance. In
images, Agni is found with four hands where the upper hands hold a torch



in kartarīmukha-hastas and the lower hands hold a porringer in kuvi-patāka-hasta. In
dance, Agni is depicted with the right hand in tripatāka-hasta and the left hand
in kāṅgula-hasta. The tripatāka-hasta depicts as if holding the torch and the kāṅgulahasta depicts as if holding the porringer.
Shilpashastra (नशल्पश स्त्र , śilpaśāstra) represents the ancient Indian science (shastra) of
creative arts (shilpa) such as sculpture, iconography and painting. Closely related to
Vastushastra (architecture), they often share the same literature.
Ayurveda (science of life)
Source: Wisdom Library: Āyurveda and botany
Agni (अनि, “heat”) is the invariable agent in the process of pāka (digestion,
transformation). It is a Sanskrit technical from Āyurveda (Indian medicine) used
throughout literature such as the Suśrutasaṃhitā or the Carakasaṃhitā. According to
the texts, Agni is responsible for the digestion and metabolism of the human body.
When Agni is unsettled, it can be the cause for a wide range of complications.



There are thirteen commonly used Agnis:
Jāṭharāgni (‘gastric fire’) cf.VRkodara/Bhiima.
The seven Dhātvāgni:
Rasāgni,
Raktāgni,
Māṃsāgni,
Medāgni,
Asthyāgni,
Majjāgni,
Śukrāgni.
The five Bhūtāgni:
Ākāśāgni,
Vāyvagni,
Tejogni,
Jalāgni,
Pārthivāgni.
There are three kinds of vitiated Agni:
Viṣamāgni,
Tīkṣnāgni
and Mandāgni.
Mandāgni is the most common cause of most of the diseases, but all three abnormalities
of Agni are responsible for producing the various types of diseases
Source: Google Books: Ayurveda for health & Well-Being
In Ayurveda, Agni is a technical concept of energetics that has its origins in Tejas (fire),
one of the primordial pentads. Proper functioning of Agni is responsible for health and
its primary indication is appetite or hunger.
Agni is the biological fire which is converting. It governs digestion and metabolism.
Ingested substances are converted by Agni into an easier form for assimilation,



absoprtion, nourishment and storage in the body. Anything you see, hear, smell, feel by
touch etc. is converted by Agni into an impression and stored in the memory. Agni
metabolizes and extracts nourishment from the environment. Formation of the Doshas, Dhatus and Malas is also a prdouct of Agni. Agni creates cells, tissues and information.
Agni processes residues for elimination.
There are thirteen types of Agni functioning in the body.
Food digestive force, Jathara-agni.
Five elemental Agnis, Bhuta-agni,
Seven tissue Agnis, Dhatu-agni.

Agni (अनि) is the invariable agent in the process of pāka (digestion, transformation).
They are thirteen in number—jāṭharāgni (gastric fire) one, bhūtāgni five
and dhātvāgni seven. Of them the gastric fire known as Vaiśvānara (present in all living
beings) is the most important one which digests the four types of food and transforms it
into rasa and mala.

1) Agni (अनि) refers to “digestion”, as mentioned in verse 5.37-39 of the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā (Sūtrasthāna) by Vāgbhaṭa.—Accordingly, “[...] [ghee is]
recommended for wit, memory, intellect, digestion [viz., agni], strength, longevity,
sperm, eyes, [...]: ghee [viz., ghṛta] (is) possessed of a thousand powers (and), by its
(many) ways of application, productive of a thousand effects”.
2) Agni (अनि) refers to “fire” (i.e., cauterization), as mentioned in verse 5.37-39.Accordingly, “[...] [ghee is] recommended for [...] (and) those exhausted from pulmonary
rupture, pulmonary consumption, erysipelas, scalpel, and fire [viz., agni]; dispersive of
wind, choler, poison, frenzy, desiccation, unbeautifulness, and fever, [...]: ghee
[viz., ghṛta] (is) possessed of a thousand powers (and), by its (many) ways of
application, productive of a thousand effects”.

‘Agni’ itself is present in the body in the form of Pitta. When it is normal, it performs the
functions like maintenance of normal digestion, normal vision, normal body
temperature, normal complexion, valor, happiness and nutrition. When it is abnormal,
all these functions also will be abnormal (Carakasaṃhitā Sūtrasthāna 12/11). Other
functions of endocrine system are described under the functions of ‘Pitta’.

Agni (अनि) refers to the medicinal plant known as “Plumbago indica Linn.” and is dealt
with in the 15th-century Yogasārasaṅgraha (Yogasara-saṅgraha) by Vāsudeva: an
unpublished Keralite work representing an Ayurvedic compendium of medicinal
recipes. The Yogasārasaṃgraha [mentioning agni] deals with entire recipes in the route of administration, and thus deals with the knowledge of pharmacy (bhaiṣajya-kalpanā)
which is a branch of pharmacology (dravyaguṇa).
Source: gurumukhi.ru: Ayurveda glossary of terms
Agni (अनि):—1. Fire, the phenomenon of combustion manifested in light, flame, and
heat 2. One of the five basic elements (Paṅcamahābhūtas) that make up all matter in the
universe. 3. All factors responsible for digestion and metabolism / transformation. This
is of three classes: Jaṭharāgni, Bhūtāgni and Dhātvagni. 4. Physiologically, the intensity
of Agni is influenced by Doṣas and is of four types: Viṣama (irregular, due to the
dominance of Vāta), Tīkṣṇa (intense, due to the dominance of Pitta), Manda (depressed
due to the dominance of Kapha) and Sama (normal, due to the balanced state of all three Doṣas).
Āyurveda (आयुवेद, ayurveda) is a branch of Indian science dealing with medicine,
herbalism, taxology, anatomy, surgery, alchemy and related topics. Traditional practice
of Āyurveda in ancient India dates back to at least the first millenium BC. Literature is
commonly written in Sanskrit using various poetic metres.

Agni (अनि) refers to a deity that was once worshipped in ancient Kashmir (Kaśmīra)
according to the Nīlamatapurāṇa.—Agni is referred to mostly as the sacrificial fire but
his image erected by Aṅgiras is also mentioned once. As Agni’s association with goat is
known from the Vedas, the Epics and the Purāṇas, it would not be unreasonable to
suppose that Chāgaleśvara of the Nīlamata stands for Agni.

Agni (अनि) refers to one of the eight guardians of the quarters, according to
the Śivapurāṇa 2.2.22. Accordingly as Śiva said to Sitā:—“[...] the different parts of the
mountain Meru seem to be echoing the pleasing sweet sounds of bees etc. which cause
the incitement of love of the guardians of the quarters viz. Indra, Kubera, Yama, Varuṇa,
Agni, Nirṛti, Marut (Wind) and the Supreme lord (Īśa). Heaven, the abode of the Devas is
stationed on the summits of the Meru wherein the cities of the guardians of the quarters
are also situated. They are brilliant. Beautiful celestial damsels, Rambhā, Śacī, Menakā and others heighten their glory”.

Śāradātilaka-tantra III-V). The worship of these 53 gods happens after assigning them to
one of the 64 compartment while constructing a Balimaṇḍapa. Vāstu is the name of a
prodigious demon, who was killed by 53 gods (e.g., Agni).

Agni (अनि, “fire”) forms a major part of preliminary rites before Dīkṣā: an important ritual of Śāktism described in the Śāradātilaka-tantra, chapters III-V.—Fire is kindled
the next day with appropriate rites. There are eighteen purificatory rites of the kuṇḍas,



which are duly performed. The fire is placed in the yoni of the kuṇḍa and is consecrated.
The various tongues (jihvās) of fire are assigned to the various limbs of the body of the worshipper. The eight forms of fire, viz. Jātaveda, Saptajihvā, Havyavāhana, Aśvodaraja, Vaiśvānara, Kaumāratejas, Viśvamukha and Devamukha are assigned to the body of the
worshipper.
Shakta (श क्त , śākta) or Shaktism (śāktism) represents a tradition of Hinduism where

Agni (अनि) refers to:—The god of fire; son of Brahmā; the divine personification of fire
sacrifice; regarded as the mouthpiece of the demigods and their messenger to mankind.
(cf. Glossary page from Śrī Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta).
Vaishnava (वैष्णव , vaiṣṇava) or vaishnavism (vaiṣṇavism) represents a tradition of
Hinduism worshipping Vishnu as the supreme Lord. Similar to the Shaktism and
Shaivism traditions, Vaishnavism also developed as an individual movement, famous for
its exposition of the dashavatara (‘ten avatars of Vishnu’).
Jyotisha (astronomy and astrology)
Source: Wisdom Library: Brihat Samhita by Varahamihira



Agni (अनि) is the lord over the new and full moon periods of the sixth six months,
according to the Bṛhatsaṃhitā (chapter 5), an encyclopedic Sanskrit work written by
Varāhamihira mainly focusing on the science of ancient Indian astronomy (Jyotiṣa).Accordingly, “[...] Commencing from the time of creation, ... Varuṇa is the lord over the
new and full moon periods of the fifth six months; Agni over those of the sixth six
months and Yama over those of the seventh six months; [...] If Varuṇa should be the
lord, princes will suffer; the rest will be happy and crops will flourish. If Agni should be
the lord, there will be good crops, and there will also be health, freedom from fear and
abundance of water. If Yama should be the lord, there will be drought, famine, and total
blight of crops; in the next parva mankind will be afflicted with misery, hunger, death
and drought”.
Jyotisha (ज्योनतर् , jyotiṣa or jyotish) refers to ‘astronomy’ or “Vedic astrology” and
represents the fifth of the six Vedangas (additional sciences to be studied along with the
Vedas). Jyotisha concerns itself with the study and prediction of the movements of
celestial bodies, in order to calculate the auspicious time for rituals and ceremonies.
Shaivism (Shaiva philosophy)
Source: Brill: Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions
Agni (अनि) refers to “fire”, according to the Mattavilāsaprahasana.—Accordingly, as the
Kāpālika cries out: “My darling, look. This pub resembles the Vedic sacrificial ground.
For its signpost resembles the sacrificial pillar; in this case alcohol is the Soma,
drunkards are the sacrificial priests, the wine glasses are the special cups for drinking
Soma, the roasted meat and other appetizers are the fire oblations, the drunken
babblings are the sacrificial formulae, the songs are the Sāman-hymns, the pitchers are



the sacrificial ladles, thirst (tarṣa) is the fire (agni) and the owner of the pub is the
patron of the sacrifice”
Shaiva (शैव, śaiva) or Shaivism (śaivism) represents a tradition of Hinduism worshiping
Shiva as the supreme being. Closely related to Shaktism, Shaiva literature includes a
range of scriptures, including Tantras, while the root of this tradition may be traced
back to the ancient Vedas.

Agni (अनि, “fire”):—Agni is one of the most important Vedic gods representing divine
illumination. He is the protector of men and their homes. According to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Agṇi is the firstborn son of Brahmā, but in the human world, he is the son of Dharma and Vasubhārya.
As an element, Agni represents the earthly or common fire, either visible or potential
(that is, hidden in fuel). This is one of his five natural forms.
Source: Wisdom Library: Āraṇyaka
Agni (अनि, “fire”) refers to one of the devatāpañcaka (fivefold divinities), defined in the
Taittirīya-āraṇyaka 7.7.1. The devatāpañcaka, and other such fivefold divisions, are
associated with the elemental aspect (adhibhūta) of the three-fold division of reality
(adhibhūta, adhidaiva and adhyātma) which attempts to explain the phenomenal nature of the universe. Adhibhūta denotes all that belongs to the material or elemental
creation.
The Taittirīya-āraṇyaka is associated with the Kṛṣṇa-yajurveda and dates from at least
the 6th century BCE. It is composed of 10 chapters and discusses vedic rituals and
sacrifices (such as the mahāyajña) but also includes the Taittirīya-upaniṣad and the Mahānārāyaṇa-upaniṣad.
Source: Apam Napat: Indian Mythology
Agni is the God of Fire. He is said to be the son of Dyaus (Heaven) or of Heaven and
Earth [R.V.1.160]. Indra is said to be his twin brother. The later Puranas say that he is the son of Aditi and Kashyapa. The very first hymn of the Rg Veda is addressed to
him. It invokes his blessings upon mankind, extolling his virtues as the divine priest, the lord of sacrifice. Next to Indra, he is the most important Deva. Around 200 hymns are
addressed to him in the RgVeda.
There are many descriptions in the Rg Veda of his various births, forms and abodes. He
is produced daily from the two kindling sticks (aranis), which are his parents. As soon
as he is born, he devours his parents. Since great force is required to kindle him, he is
called 'son of strength'. Being produced every morning, he is forever young. No
sacrificer is older than him, for he conducted the first sacrifice. Being created in the
aerial waters, he is the embryo of the waters. Indeed as 'son-of-waters' (अप ां िप द् ), he is
a separate deity. He was born in the highest heaven, and was brought down from
heaven by Matarisvan, the Indian Prometheus. The Sun [R.V.7.63] is also regarded as a
form of Agni.
Agni is central to the sacrifice and is called the priest. He is called the domestic priest
(purohita), invoking priest (hotr), officiating priest (Adhvaryus) and playing priest
(Brahmana). Just as Indra is chief among warriors, Agni is the chief of priests.

Agni was the most important god of the Ṛg-veda, the mediator between humans and gods and the protector of men and their homes. Esoterically he represents divine
illumination. The science of fire is the key to all knowledge. The discovery of fire led to
the creation of laws, rules and discipline — civilization stems from the correct use of
fire. He is shown having 3 faces — representing the 3 Vedic fires Āhavanīya, Dakṣiṇā and Gārhapatya Agni.
His standard (symbol) is smoke (Dhūma- ketu) and he rides on a ram (Chāga) one of the

The sthāvara is a type of empirical (saṃsārī) soul, or sentient (jīva). The state of empirical souls due to the rise of ‘stationery-body-making karma’/ sthāvara-nāmakarma, having only one type of sense
organ namely body and which cannot move around freely are called with stationery
bodies (sthāvara), eg., jala.

These are the living beings that have fire as their body. How many types of fire are
there? There are four types of fire namely fire, fire-bodied, life in fire body and life
tending towards a fire body.

[Agni is the God of Fire, the Ignis of the Latins and Ogni of the Slavonians. He is one of
the most prominent deities of the Ṛgveda. He, as an immortal, has taken up his abode
among mortals as their guest; he is the domestic priest, the successful accomplisher and
protector of all ceremonies; he is also the religious leader and preceptor of the gods, a
swift messenger employed to announce to the immortals the hymns and to convey to them the oblations of their worshippers, and to bring them down from the sky to the
place of sacrifice. He is sometimes regarded as the mouth and the tongue through which
both gods and men participate in the sacrifices. He is the lord, protector and leader of
people, monarch of men, the lord of the house, friendly to mankind, and like a father,
mother, brother &c. He is represented as being produced by the attrition of two pieces
of fuel which are regarded as husband and wife. Sometimes he is considered to have been brought down from heaven or generated by Indra between two clouds or stones,
created by Dyau, or fashioned by the gods collectively. In some passages he is
represented as having a triple existence, which may mean his threefold manifestations
as the sun in heaven, lightning in the atmosphere, and as ordinary fire on the earth,
although the three appearances are also elsewhere otherwise explained. His epithets
are numberless and for the most part descriptive of his physical characteristics : िूमके तु,
हुतभुज् , शुनि, रोनहत श्व , सप्तनजह्व , तोमरिर, ृर्घत न्न , नित्रभ िु , ऊार्ध्शोनिस् , शोन ेिष्कश , हररके श,
नहरण्यदन्त , अयोदांष्ट् र (dhūmaketu, hutabhuj, śuci, rohitāśva, saptajihva, tomaradhara, ghṛtānna, citrabhānu, ūrdhvaśocis, śociṣkeśa, harikeśa, hiraṇyadanta, ayodaṃṣṭra) &c.
In a celebrated passage he is said to have 4 horns, 3 feet, 2 heads, and 7 hands. The
highest divine functions are ascribed to Agni. He is said to have spread out the two
worlds and produced them, to have supported heaven, formed the mundane regions
and luminaries of heaven, to have begotten Mitra and caused the sun to ascend the sky. He is the head and summit of the sky, the centre of the earth. Earth, Heaven and all
beings obey his commands. He knows and sees all worlds or creatures and witnesses all
their actions. The worshippers of Agni prosper, they are wealthy and live long. He is the
protector of that man who takes care to bring him fuel. He gives him riches and no one
can overcome him who sacrifices to this god. He confers, and is the guardian of,
immortality. He is like a water-trough in a desert and all blessing issue from him. He is therefore constantly supplicated for all kinds of boons, riches, food, deliverance from
enemies and demons, poverty, reproach, childlessness, hunger &c. Agni is also
associated with Indra in different hymns and the two gods are said to be twin brothers.
Such is the Vedic conception of Agni; but in the course of mythological personifications
he appears as the eldest son of Brahmā and is called Abhimānī [Viṣṇu Purāṇa]. His wife
was Svāhā; by her, he had 3 sons Pāvaka, Pavamāna and Śuchi; and these had forty
five sons; altogether 49 persons who are considered identical with the 49 fires. He is
also represented as a son of Aṅgiras, as a king of the Pitṛs or Manes, as a Marut and as a
grandson of Śāṇḍila, and also as a star. The Harivaṃśa describes him as clothed in black,
having smoke for his standard and head-piece and carrying a flaming javelin. He is
borne in a chariot drawn by red horses and the 7 winds are the wheels of his car. He is



accompanied by a ram and sometimes he is represented as riding on that animal. Agni
was appointed by Brahamā as the sovereign of the quarter between the south and east, whence the direction is still known as Āgneyī. The Mahābhārata represents Agni as
having exhausted his vigour and become dull by devouring many oblations at the
several sacrifices made by king Śvetaki, but he recruited his strength by devouring the
whole Khāṇḍava forest; for the story see the word ख ण्डव (khāṇḍava)].

the KRshNa(kaala/syaama/ samaya/tanaya/
dhanya/syena/yajna) Yajurveda. The immediate purpose of the
Agnicayana(Sruta satra /DhRta raashTra cf.sruta
ear-veda-varsha-kara-arka , , -karNa-srava-sruu
sarpa-svar) is to build up for the sacrificer an immortal body



that is permanently beyond the reach of the transitory nature of
life, suffering and death that, according to this rite, characterizes
man's mortal existence.
The ritual emerged from predecessor rituals of IVC, which were
incorporated as building blocks, around the 10th century BCE,
and was likely continuously practiced until the late Vedic period,
or the 6th century BCE.
