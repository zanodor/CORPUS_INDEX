# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Meluhha visual language is Indus Script.pdf

Meluhha visual language is Indus Script
-- Cipher is defined as ‘disguised way of writing a code’
-- Picture as a disguise signifies a Meluhha word; the disguise
unravels ‘a similar sounding word’ called homonym in linguistics
-- Visual language is deployed on figurines, sculptures, tablets, seals,
potsherds, copper tablets, even on metal equipment
-- M-295 Bas-relief tablet shows interlocked bodies of tigers. This picture signifies Meluhha word चाळाcāḷā ’interlocked bodies’, cāli ’interlocked’. Similar
sounding word is: ಶಾಲಿಕ śālika. a village of artificers. This is how, the Script
Cipher presents pictorially disguised meaning – village of artificers.

Script as an accounting system for wealth-trade categories
-- Expanded venn diagram -- Set Theory in Mathematics is used to demonstrate a Venn Diagram intersection for Indus Script cipher as an intersection between a hieroglyph set signifying pictures and a set of Meluhha words signifying wealth-creation activities of artificers
Venn diagram, in mathematics, illustrating the intersection of two sets.
The intersection creates the Indus Script Corpora.
This set of three graphemes explains the form and function of the script. Kana ‘spine’ rebus: kana ‘wealth’; karana ‘rim of jar’ rebus: karana ‘messenger, dispatch’; karada ‘currycomb’ rebus: karada ‘daybook’. Thus, the entire corpora are documenting 1. wealth ledgersand 2. trade accounting cargo manifests.
H-1997 tablet adds another Sign 65 and other graphemes, cartouche with 24 pellets, leafless tree, two bisons, to the central set. Sign 65 reads ayo ‘fish’ rebus: ayas ‘alloy metal’ + lid. musa ‘lid’ rebus: muhã ‘furnace produce’ Other graphemes signify: goldsmithy, gem-setting, metalcasting
