# Index for Tom van Bakel – Bulls, lions and sheep form cuneiform signs on Ancient Near East cylinder seals.pdf

Bulls, lions and sheep from cuneiform signs
on Ancient Near East cylinder seals
I have known for a long time that the animal figures on the cylinder seals form signs such as X- and V-signs, but to my utter surprise I discovered that these animals can also form the cuneiform sign ‘dawn’. This was extremely important because all Holy Weddings took place in the morning, moreover, when rising the sun god Utu married Aya, the goddess of the dawn.
Number 1
I think that in this imprint there are five different signs hidden that together make up a story. But first of all I have to tell you that to me the animals represented gods, which was not unusual at the time:
Enki and the world order: c.1.1.3
He filled the E-kur, the house of Enlil, with possessions. Enlil was delighted with Enki and Nibru was glad. He demarcated borders and fixed boundaries. For the Anuna gods, Enki situated dwellings in cities and disposed agricultural land into fields. Enki (the god of the earth) placed in charge of the whole of heaven and earth the hero, the bull who comes out of the ?ašur forest bellowing truculently, the youth Utu (the sun god), the bull standing triumphantly, audaciously, majestically, the father of the Great City (an expression for the underworld), the great herald in the east of holy An, the judge who searches out verdicts for the gods, with a lapis-lazuli beard, rising from the horizon into the holy heavens -- Utu, the son born by Ningal
In addition, it was not uncommon for kings to call themselves a lion or a calf who had been engendered by a breed-bull and who were born from a cow:
A praise poem of Šulgi (Šulgi C): c.2.4.2.03 I am the king, a wild bull of acknowledged strength, a lion with wide-open jaws! I am Šulgi, a wild bull of acknowledged strength, a lion with wide-open jaws! I am a great storm let loose from heaven, sending its splendour far and wide! I am good stock, with brindled body, engendered by a breedbull! I am a king born from a cow, resting amid butter and milk! I am the calf of a thick-necked white cow, reared in the cow-pen!
It is therefore self-evident that animal figures appear on the ancient seals.
To clarify the meaning of the above imprint, I start this essay with a divine bull that is fertilizing the hills.



Number 2
In the front side of this Syrian stamp a special star sign indicates that the bull with an erected phallus represents Ashur. Like Enlil he copulate with the great hills and there was a roar like a bull’s:
The debate between Winter and Summer: c.5.3.3
‘He copulated with the great hills, he gave the mountain its share. He filled its womb with Summer and Winter, the plenitude and life of the Land. As Enlil copulated with the earth, there was a roar like a bull's. The hill spent the day at that place and at night she opened her loins. She bore Summer and Winter as smoothly as fine oil.’
Number 2
The copulation of a god sure will be fruitful and the result of this intercourse is depicted on the back of this stamp as this V-sign symbolizes a womb which suggests childbirth. It has nine radiant stripes which might indicate nine months of pregnancy.
We essentially see here what is repeated in thousands of other seals: a god begets a child and about nine months later a goddess gives birth to this very child.



Number 3
This story is also told in this imprint but now by human figures.
On the left two male persons, probably a god and a king, approach a naked goddess. The two XE signs in between them mean ‘barley’ and ‘grain’, but they also can be translated as ‘seed’. This means that these two signs suggest that the two human figures inseminate the goddess and conceive a child.
XE The Sumerian sign (Jaritz #669) reads še (for *ši), 'barley', and 'grain, seed'.
http://reocities.com/proto-language/ProtoLanguage-Monosyllables.htm.
On the right this goddess, who is called Ama-dug-bad (mother spreading her knees)’, gives birth to the child.
So, according to this imprint the seal owner has two fathers and one mother. This may be similar to what we read in a praise poem in which Lipit-Eštar writes that he is a son of Enlil (the god of the wind) and that his father is Išme-Dagan. He does not write anything about his human mother, but he only mentions mother Ninlil, the divine spouse of Ninlil.
A praise poem of Lipit-Ectar (Lipit-Ectar B)
1-14. Lipit-Eštar, proud king, enthroned prince, most seemly offshoot of kingship, who walks like Utu, brilliant light of the Land, lofty in nobility, riding on the great divine powers; who settles the people in the four quarters; favoured by Enlil, beloved by Ninlil, trustworthy youth with shining eyes, worthy of the throne-dais, whose seemly head is adorned with the tiara, the good headdress, who holds in his hand the sceptre over the black-headed, prince Lipit-Eštar, son of Enlil, wise shepherd, who leads the people to let them relax ...... in pleasant shade, lord, great bison, beloved by An! Your trust is put in Mother Ninlil; Lipit-Eštar, you exert great power. 51-56. Among joyful songs of the heart, in an auspicious regnal year, the prince, the powerful prince surpassing in greatness and majesty, your father Išme-Dagan, king of the Land, made the foundations of his throne firm for you. On the orders of An and Enlil, he silenced the loud (?) strife of the foreign countries.
Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL).



Number 4
Here we see a scorpion, a few symbols and the same Ama-dug-bad, who is about to give birth to a child. On this imprint the conceiving is suggested by the cross next to her.
This cross symbolizes among others: ‘male’, ‘father’ and ‘virile’:
pap [RELATION] (86x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pap first and foremost, pre-eminent; father; male, virile; brother Akk. abu; ahu; ašar?du; zikaru
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
The point is that when we assume that this imprint shows a story, then the cross indicates that a virile male conceives a child and becomes a father, and that Ama-dug-bath gives birth to this very child and becomes a mother.
Number 5 a
In this print of a basic seal, a cross suggests that a virile male conceives a child, but here an oval, instead of Ama-dug-bath, suggests that this child is given birth by his mother.
Number 5 b
The oval is Vesica Piscis configuration which symbolizes a vulva in the first place.



Number 6
The same story is symbolized on this imprint:
o The cross, this time formed of leaves or vulvas, symbolizes ‘male’ and ‘virility’, o And the diamond, with a stripe through it, symbolizes a vulva.
Together they made clear that the owner of the seal was conceived and born.
https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces71507.html
Diamonds have been known as so-called ‘token’. As you see they have different meanings, but when associated with a cross they will surely have meant ‘womb’.
A bulla (Medieval Latin for ‘a round seal’, from Classical Latin bulla, ‘bubble, blob’; plural bullae) is an inscribed clay or soft metal (such as lead or tin) or bitumen or wax token used in commercial and legal documentation as a form of authentication and for tamper-proofing whatever is attached to it (or, in the historical form, contained in it).
During the period 8,000–7,500 BCE, the Sumerian agriculturalists needed a way to keep records of their animals and goods. Small clay tokens were formed and shaped by the palms to represent certain animals and goods. Clay tokens allowed for agriculturalists to keep track of animals and food that had been traded, stored, and/or sold. Because grain production became such a major part of life, they needed to store their extra grain in shared facilities and account for their food. This clay token system went unchanged for about 4,000 years until the tokens started to become more elaborate in appearance. The tokens were similar in size, material, and color but the markings had more of a variety of shapes. As the growth of goods being produced grew and the exchanging of goods became more common, changes to tokens were made to keep up with the growth. Transactions for trading needed to be accounted for efficiently, so the clay tokens were placed in a clay ball (bulla), which helped with dishonesty and kept all the tokens together. In order to account for the tokens, the bulla would have to be crushed to reveal their content. Seals were impressed into the opening of the bullae to prevent tampering. Each party had its own unique seal to identify them. Seals would not only identify individuals, but it would also identify their office. Sometimes, the token was impressed onto the wet bulla before it dried so that the owner could remember what exactly was in the bulla without having to break it.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulla_(seal)



Number 11
Once it was known that the two signs suggested the same story over and over again, they could be varied endlessly: apparently these signs were not yet generally standardized. Some of the vulva symbols that are depicted on the cylinder seals have also been used in other cultures.
Number 9
‘Six symbolic abstract representations of external female genitals (i.e. ‘yonic’ symbols) which have been used in various historical/cultural contexts:
1) Upper left: A schematized drawing of the pubic triangle; among other things, this is the earliest archaic form of the ancient Sumerian cuneiform sign MUNUS (meaning ‘woman’)
2) Upper right: A composite version of Hindu Yoni symbols. It combines features of various versions of Indian Yoni symbols (such as the one seen in Image: Lingam.jpg)
3) Lower left: One form of the pointed oval encountered in many contexts as a representation or symbol of the vulva (including as part of medieval Sheela-na-gig figures).
4) Center: Oval within oval (another variation of the preceding).
5) Lower center: Quasi-original form of an Egyptian hieroglyph used in the spellings of the ancient Egyptian words for ‘woman’ and ‘vulva’.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vulva_symbols.svg



Number 8
This imprint also shows what is repeated in thousands of seals:
o The cross suggests that a virile man conceives a child o And the vulva indicates that this child is born afterwards.
We see here that the cross and the vulva gradually merge into each other.
I suppose that these two signs are related to deities, and I now speculate, that they are related to An, the god of heaven, and to Ki, the goddess of the earth. The cross has four arms and the diamond has four sides. In the Sumerian texts number four is mentioned several times, for instance the world in divided in four quarters:
A hymn to Nanna (Nanna O): c.4.13.15
In the four quarters of the world the black-headed people raise their eyes to you, the first-born son of Enlil. Nanna, youthful Suen, as you move the Anuna gods stand in attendance. In the four quarters of the world the black-headed people raise their eyes to you, the first-born son of Enlil.
And heaven has four corners:
The Keš temple hymn: c.4.80.2
The four corners of heaven became green for Enlil like a garden. Keš was positioned there for him with head uplifted, and as Keš lifted its head among all the lands, Enlil spoke in praise of Keš.
This means that number four, among others, is related to heaven as well as to earth, so these cross/womb seals might originally mean that Heaven (An) and Earth (Ki) create children.
Nevertheless, the cuneiform sign for quarter (of the universe) is a bit different:
anubda [QUARTER] (1748x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. an-ub-da; ub-da ’a cosmographic or geographic term; quarter (of the universe)’ Akk. kibrat arbatu
[1] an-ub-da (an ub-da)
[2] ub-da



Number 10 a
Once again, the cross symbolizes ‘male’ and ‘virile’, and the diamond symbolizes ‘heart’, and ‘womb’.
The diamonds also look like the token ki, which among others means ‘earth’:
https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces71507.html
ki [PLACE] (32379x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium, unknown) wr. ki ’place; ground, earth, land; toward; underworld; land, country; lower, down below’ Akk. ašru; er?etu; m?tu; qaqqaru; šaplû
[1] ki (gu14)
http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sumerian.htm
This brings another association: the four arms of the cross and the four sides of the diamond may also indicate that the seal belongs to a king who is called: ‘King of the four quarters’:
Ur-Namma the canal-digger (Ur-Namma D): c.2.4.1.4
King of the four quarters, you who make Enlil content, Ur-Namma, provider of Nibru, supporter of Urim, with you (?) the people pass the time joyously at (?) moonlight over the Land of Urim.
By the way, diamonds also mean: ’to mix (up); process and alloy’:
hi [MIX] (2735x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. hi ’to mix (up); process (skin; wool, in the latter possibly a stage between combing and spinning); alloy’ Akk. balālu
[1] hi
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
It is clear that they have a few different meanings, but together with the X-sign the diamonds may symbolize a womb that suggests childbirth:



Number 10
Again, a typical cross and a vulva show that a child is conceived and born.
Here the four arms of the cross are made of ladders, and these ladders may mean ‘to blow, to light up, shine, to rise’:
Proto-cuneiform signs by Ashur Cherry
This means that these kar signs may indicate Enlil, the god of the wind, in the first place:
kar [BLOW] (52x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. kar2-kar2; kar2 ‘to blow; to light up, shine; to rise’ Akk. napāhu See aga kar[defeat], igi kar[examine], ni karkar[circle], šu kar[denigrate].
[1] kar2-kar2
[2] kar2
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
So, here the ladders may suggest that Enlil engenders the owner of the seal and then his spouse Ninlil gives birth to him:
An adab to Bau for Išme-Dagan (Išme-Dagan B): c.2.5.4.02
Supreme lady, whose divine powers are untouchable, daughter of An, omniscient great lady, young woman, Mother Bau, you have looked favourably on the young man of handsome form, prince IšmeDagan, the son of Enlil; you have determined for him a good fate once and for all.



Number 12
Here the gods are clearly identified by circles: the circle in the centre of the cross represents number 10 which is related to Iškur/Adad. The two circles represent number 20 related to the sun god Utu and the three circles represent 30 related to the moon god Suen.
This imprint may state that Iškur/Adad creates a child at new moon (so when the sun and the moon conjunct). The womb may indicate that this child is born afterwards.
Drill holes represent numbers: one drill hole represents number 10; two drill holes represent number 20 and three drill holes number 30. Numbers on their turn are related to deities: number 10 to the storm god Iškur/Adad, number 20 to the sun god Utu/Shamash and number 30 to the moon god Nanna/Suen:
‘The first hint that a cryptographic number system was applied to the Great Gods came with the discovery that the names of the gods Suen, Shamash, and Ishtar were sometimes substituted in the texts by the numbers 30, 20, and 15, respectively. The highest unit of the Sumerian sexagesimal system - 60 - was assigned to Anu; Enlil ‘was’ 50; Enki, 40; and Adad, 10. The number 10 and its six multiples within the prime number 60 were thus assigned to male deities, and it would appear plausible that the numbers ending with 5 were assigned to the female deities. From this, the following cryptographic table emerges:’
Male: 60 - Anu, 50 -Enlil, 40 - Ea/Enki, 30 - Nanna/Suen, 20 - Utu/Shamash, 10 Iškur/Adad Female: 55 - Antu, 4.5 - Ninlil, 35 - Ninki, 25 -Ningal, 15 - Inanna/Ishtar, 5 Ninhursag
http://www.rulit.net/books/the-12th-planet-read-299421-25.html



Number 7
From mathematical crosses and diamonds we are taking a big step towards animals, because this imprint depicts the same story, but this time the cross is formed by two lions and the diamond is formed by two sheep with a vertical mark through them. These four animals depict the usual engender story, but they add to it that the owner of the seal is conceived in Leo and born in Aries.
The sheep also indicate Anu, the god of heaven, as he is the presiding deity of the ‘Month of the Sancuary’, i.e. of Aries.

2 Araḫ Āru

3 Araḫ Simanu Suen BI(KAŠ)

This means that the two sheep indicate that An is the creating deity, and thus Uraš, another name of the goddess of earth, must be the divine mother:
A praise poem of ’Šulgi (’Šulgi c.2.4.2.16
‘I, the lady ...... holy temple of residence ....... My mother, Uraš, the lady of the gods and my father, An, the king of the gods ...... the woman, the good cow in the great sheepfold. They give me enduring kingship. They have placed the people in their entirety in my hands.’



Number 13
On this imprint two sheep and a spike form an inverted triangle which symbolizes the cuneiform sign ‘female genitals’ or ‘vulva’:
mug [Genitals] wr. mug2 ’female genitals, vulva’ Akk. bi???ru; ?ru
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
This sign suggests that a begotten child is born in Aries during the harvest of barley.
Number 14
Now we can easily see that in this imprint the cross, formed by lions, suggests that the seal owner is conceived in Leo, and the vulva, formed by sheep, suggests that the same owner is born in Aries.
Number 15
And here we see that two bulls form a vulva suggesting that the seal owner, Ukinulmas, son of Naramsin, is born in Taurus and the two lions suggest that he is conceived in Leo.



Number 16
In this imprint two lions form a cross suggesting that the seal owner is conceived in Leo.
This kind of seals were made between 2700 and 2300 B.C. and in these centuries the sun passed through the constellation Leo in June. In the Ancient Near East this was a special month as it was customary to get married in June, which was a custom in ancient Rome too:
In Rome June is known for the large number of marriages that occur over the course of the month. According to one etymology, June is named after Juno. Juno was the goddess of marriage and a married couple's household, so some consider it good luck to be married in this month.
Published: http://en.wikipedia.org/
When a child was conceived on the wedding night in the constellation Leo it was believed that the seed came from a lion (so from Leo), as we can read in a poem of Šulgi:
An adab to Enlil for Šulgi (Šulgi G): c.2.4.2.07
Enlil gave him a good name: 'A lion's seed, who provides the E-kur generously, the beloved one of Ninlil; the one granted authority in the E-kur; the king of Urim, the one with shining heart, the shepherd, the protective genius of the Land'.
Number 16
On the right two sheep and a spike form an inverted triangle which symbolizes a womb. Once again, when we assume that this imprint shows a story, then this cross suggests that a virile male conceives a child in Leo and becomes a father, and the vulva suggests that a mother gives birth to this child in Aries when barley is harvested.



Number 17
On this seal a new aspect has been added to the image: the naked youth, who forms the vulva symbol together with the two sheep, is the child conceived in Leo and born in Aries.
The scorpion may represent Iskhara, a scorpion goddess, she is related to Ishtar:
The evidence that the scorpion is Iskhara is drawn from an astrological omen tablet. In Thompson, ‘Reports of the Magicians’, p. 76), we read: ‘ Anu {D. P. muT) Akrahi {D. P. ilu) Iskhara ina la'ah iirrisha,’ etc., ‘when in the flaming Ught of Scorpio Iskhara,’ etc. Here Scorpio and Iskhara are identified. See also Jensen (‘ Kosmologie,’ pp. 72, 73) for ‘ {Mul) Girtah-Iskhara tamtim,’ where Girtab, Sumerian for Akrabu, scorpion, is equated with Iskhara, a goddess resembling Venus. The scorpion is frequently depicted on the stones and Iskhara is frequently mentioned. She is a goddess of the Kassite pantheon of whom very little is known. She is related to Ishtar and is called ‘Goddess of the Holy Mound,’ that is, of the sea (Sayce, ‘Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia,’ p. 374).
Published: The Seal Cylinders of Western Asia by Hayes Ward
Like Ishtar/Inanna she may become the spouse of the young man (see below).



Number 22
In this imprint, two lions form a cross symbolizing the marriage of Suen to Ningal. Together they conceive their children Utu and Inanna.
Here the sun god Utu is the human figure with his arms stretching wide:
Inanna and Ebi?: c.1.3.2
My lady, on your acquiring the stature of heaven, maiden Inanna, on your becoming as magnificent as the earth, on your coming forth like Utu the king and stretching your arms wide, on your walking in heaven and wearing fearsome terror, on your wearing daylight and brilliance on earth, on your walking in the mountain ranges and bringing forth beaming rays, on your bathing the girin plants of the mountains (in light), on your giving birth to the bright mountain, the mountain, the holy place, on your ......, on your being strong with the mace like a joyful lord, like an enthusiastic (?) lord, on your exulting in such battle like a destructive weapon -- the black-headed people ring out in song and all the lands sing their song sweetly.
Number 22
So, the two lions form an X-sign symbolizing the engendering of the two children in Leo.
Number 22
And the vulva symbol, , is formed by the two lions and the human figure standing in the middle. This vulva obviously suggests the birth of the children.
So, here the two lions form a cross as well as a vulva.



Number 18 a
The same happens here: the two meandering lines, a so-called ‘braid pattern’, form crosses as well as vulvas, flowing into each other.
Number 18 b
Just like the ‘copulating snakes’, used many times, form crosses and vulvas.
Number 18 c
And in this print we see a so-called ‘diamond pattern’ in which two lines form crosses and diamonds.
By the way, the diamond pattern looks like the Bala or buluĝ sign, which, among others’ means ‘to grow’:
Proto-cuneiform signs by Ashur Cherry
buluĝ [GROW] (56x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. buluĝ3; buluĝ5; bu-lu-ug; buluĝ ‘to grow up, rear, make grow; novice; foster child’ Akk. rabû; tarbûtu See ni buluĝ[boast].
[1] buluĝ3 (bulug3)
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
This concept is of course extremely appropriate for the growth of the foetus in the belly of the mother.



Number 22
Suen and Ningal are the parents of Inanna and on this imprint she is indicated by XE sign which means, among others, ‘barley’.
XE The Sumerian sign (Jaritz #669) reads še (for *ši), 'barley', and 'grain, seed'.
http://reocities.com/proto-language/ProtoLanguage-Monosyllables.htm.
She can be indicated by this cereal because in a song she is called ‘a shock of two-row barley’:
A song of Inanna and Dumuzid (Dumuzid-Inanna R): c.4.08.18
Maiden, glossy mane, lovely beauty, Inanna, glossy mane, lovely beauty! Maiden, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer, Inanna, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer! Maiden, colourful as a pile of grain, fit for the king, Inanna, colourful as a pile of grain, fit for Dumuzid! Maiden, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness, Inanna, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness!



Number 22
The sun god Utu is the man with his arms stretching wide. He is also indicated by the square with a cross inside, which means ‘red’ or ‘blood’:
Proto-cuneiform signs by Ashur Cherry
dara [RED] (43x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dara4 ’(to be) red; (to be) brown; blood’ Akk. d?mu
[1] dara4
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
In the morning the sun god is red because he fights with darkness of the night and from his face drips blood:
Enmerkar and the lord of Aratta: c.1.8.2.3
‘Repeat this to your master, to the lord of Kulaba, a lion lying on its paws in E-ana, a bull bellowing within it, within his ?ipar, fruitful as a flourishing meš tree. The mountain range is a warrior, ...... high, like Utu going to his abode at twilight, like one from whose face blood drips; or like Nanna, who is majestic in the high heavens, like him whose countenance shines with radiance, who ...... is like the woods in the mountains.’
He is a warrior, his terror radiates in battle. And the spear of Nergal (another name of the sun god) reaches into the blood of the Land:
A praise poem of Šulgi (Šulgi X): c.2.4.2.24
‘As if you were Utu, your terror radiates in battle. As if you were Nergal, your battle-mace drools with gore and your spear reaches into the blood of the Land. You are the great door of the city, you are the great wall of the Land. You are a net piled up (?) over heaven and earth, you are a cosmic bond laid for Sumer. May ...... proclaim your glory in abundance! May the words of Enlil, which are so enormous, provide a shelter over your head! May the loving heart, Inanna, never abandon you!’



Number 22
But there is another sign hidden in this imprint: the two sheep together with the two horizontal lines form the cuneiform sign ‘zal’.
Number 22
Conversely, we see that the sign resembles the cuneiform sign ‘zal’: , which, among other things, means ‘to get up early’ and ‘shine’:
zal [PASS] (2798x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. zal ’to get up early; to finish, come to an end; to dissolve, melt, disintegrate, break down, collapse; to quake; to pass time’ Akk. naharmumu; naharmu?u; qatû; râbu See ud zal[pass].
[1] zal
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
zal [SHINE] (2x: Old Babylonian) wr. zal ’shine’
[1] zal
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html



Number 22
So, the person in the middle is Utu. Once again, he is indicated in two ways: by stretching his arms wide and by the square with a cross inside which means ‘red’ and ‘blood’.
Number 22
Conversely, we see that the sun god is standing in the middle of the ‘zal’ sign.
The Sumerian word for the sun is ‘ud’, and this is its sign:
ud [sun](29106x: Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ud ’day; heat; a fever; summer; sun’ Akk. immu; ummedu; umšu; šamšu; ?mu See ud šuš[darken], ud zal[pass].
[1] ud (u4)
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
The point is, that the sign ‘ud’ together with the ‘zal’ sign form the cuneiform sign ‘dawn’ sign:
ud zal [PASS] (117x: Old Babylonian) wr. ud zal ’to pass (said of time); to dawn; to do something at daybreak’ Akk. ? (ud[sun] + zal[pass time])
[1] ud zal
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
So, the cuneiform sign ‘dawn’ consists of the signs ‘ud’ and ‘zal’, but on the imprint the ‘ud’ sign is replaced by an image of the sun god himself.



Number 1
Utu
Analysing this imprint I start with the person who is almost standing in the middle. He is Utu and he is depicted as a naked youth because he is referred several times as ‘youthful Utu’, like in the myth of ‘Inanna and An’:
Inanna and An: c.1.3.5
Holy Inanna spoke to her brother the hero, youthful Utu: ‘......, I want to tell you something -- pay attention to my speech. ......, my twin, I want to tell you something -- pay attention to my speech.’
He has a special headdress: in the myth ‘Gilgameš and ?uwawa’ we read that he put on his lapis-lazuli diadem and came forward with head high:
Gilgameš and ?uwawa (Version B): c.1.8.1.5.1 Utu of heaven put on his lapis-lazuli diadem and came forward with head high. In his hand Gilgameš, the lord of Kulaba, held a holy staff before his nose: ‘Utu, I want to set off into the mountains! May you be my helper! I want to set off into the mountains of Cedar-felling! May you be my helper!’



Number 19
Inanna Suen Shamash
This print confirms that the person in the radiant headdress is indeed Utu, for his name is written on it in cuneiform writing. This name indicates that the bearded person on the right is the sun god, but it also indicates that the person in the middle is his wife Inanna. Man and wife are depicted more or less the same and they both have a radiant headdress.
https://www.goldenageproject.org.uk/969.php
This headdress resembles the image of the Phaistos Disk and symbolizes that the sun god is a lord, a prince or a king. Utu god is all: he is mentioned prince as well as lord in a temple hymn:
The temple hymns: c.4.80.1
O Zimbir, dais upon which Utu sits daily, E-nun-ana (House of the prince of heaven), star of heaven, crown given birth by Ningal, house of Utu, your prince, the ...... of the universe, fills heaven and earth. When the lord sleeps, the people sleep; when he rises, the people rise. The bull ...... and the people prostrate themselves.
And he was a king too:
Enmerkar and En-su?gir-ana: c.1.8.2.4
At that time the day was lord, the night was sovereign, and Utu was king.
To complete the story of the above seal: as you can see, Utu is depicted twice; left and right. On the left, between Inanna and Utu, is the moon god Suen, who is depicted as a youth as he is the god of the new moon and thus has just been born again. The special thing is that despite his age he is already the father of the sun god and of Inanna.
These deities indeed are family: Inanna, her mother, her father and her brother are mentioned together in the next verse:
A hymn to Inanna as Ninegala (Inanna D): c.4.07.4
Inanna, you are the lady of the great divine powers. Your mother Ningal ...... great attributes. Your father Suen ...... great holy cows. Your brother, the youth Utu ....... Your spouse Ama-ušumgalana, the shepherd, Lord Dumuzid, ....... Your beloved minister (?) Ninšubur ....... Your beloved sister-in-law ?eštin-ana ....... (3 lines fragmentary or missing)



Number 20
Suen Ningal Aya Utu Inanna Suen Ningal
On this imprint we can recognize Utu again by his special radiant headdress. Here he fights with a lion. Together with this lion, with the sheep and with the two stripes he forms the cuneiform sign ‘dawn’. But first we start with the other signs that are included in this print.
Number 20
On the left we see that a bearded bull man and a lion form an X-sign, symbolizing the conception of two children in Leo.
Number 20
Then we discover that the bearded bull man, the lion and the naked youth form a vulva sign which suggests childbirth.



Number 20
And here we see that the sheep, naked young man and the lion form a sign that resembles the
cuneiform sign ‘zal’ , which means, among other things, ‘to get up early’ and ‘shine’:
Number 20
Together the ‘zal’ sign and the sun god represent the cuneiform sign ‘dawn’ .
Once again, in Sumerian mythology dawn is very important because all festivals start at dawn, all Holly Weddings were celebrated at dawn and the sun god Utu marries Aya, the goddess of dawn.



Number 21
This print shows two small drill holes that represent number 20 which is related to Utu. So, these two drill holes indicate that the warrior next to them is the sun god.
Number 21
Here two bearded bull-men form the X-sign indicating the conceiving of a child.
Number 21
But when we lengthen the diagonal lines, more or less a vulva symbol is created with the person standing in the middle. This vulva obviously suggests the birth of the conceived child.
Number 21
But there is another sign hidden in this imprint: the two lions together with the two horizontal lines form the ‘zal’ sign.



Number 21
This print shows two small drill holes that represent number 20 that is related to Utu. They indicate that the warrior next to them is the sun god. It is obvious that in this imprint the ‘zal’ sign and the sun are united too.
These kind of imprints show something very remarkable: together with the 'zal' sign Utu forms the sign 'dawn' and at the same time the sun god is united with his wife Aya, the goddess of dawn.



Number 23
Ningal Suen Utu Inanna
This imprint two X-signs indicate two Marriages:
1. On the left a Marriage of the moon god Suen and his wife Ningal in Leo. 2. On the right a Marriage of their children: the sun god Utu and his sister Inanna.
On the right we can recognize Utu by his special hair dress or headdress. He forms a cross with his sister Inanna, who has the shape of a cow.
A prayer to Inanna for ?ammu-r?bi (?ammu-r?bi F): c.2.8.2.6
Foremost among the gods, manifest, ...... his destiny! Inanna, without whom An and Enlil cannot make a decision in the Land, proud one among the Anuna gods, ...... self-esteem and ......! Inanna, good wild cow of the great princes, respected among ladies ......, your greatness shines forth to heaven and earth, your divine powers are ...... powers.
This cross symbolizes that they practice a Sacred Marriage too.
Number 23
Utu Inanna Ningal Suen
When we lengthen the diagonal lines, more or less a vulva symbol is created with the killed sheep in the middle. This vulva obviously suggests the birth of Utu and Inanna.
o So, Suen and Ningal, in the shapes of a lion and a sheep, form a cross on the left. They practice a Sacred Marriage and beget their children Utu and Inanna in Leo, of course indicated by the lion. o Nine months later Inanna and Utu are born in Taurus, which of course is indicated by the Inanna cow. o Then Inanna and Utu marry, which is symbolized by the cross on the right.



Number 24
On this imprint we can recognize Utu again by his special radiant headdress. Here he holds a lion.
Number 24
Suen to Ningal
On the left a lion and a cow form a cross which suggests that the moon god Suen and his wife Ningal unite and engender their children Utu and Inanna.
Number 24
Two sheep and the naked youth form a vulva which suggests that Utu and Inanna are being born in Aries.



Number 24
Utu to Aya Utu Utu to Inanna
The other two crosses suggest that on his turn Utu unites with Aya as well as with Inanna.
So this imprint depicts six animals forming three crosses:
o The cross on the left may symbolize the Marriage of Suen to his wife Ningal. During this Marriage they conceive the sun god Utu and his sister Inanna. o The cross in the middle may symbolize the Marriage of Utu to Aya, the goddess of dawn. o And the cross on the right may symbolize the Marriage of Utu to his sister Inanna.
Knowing all this the big question arises: ‘What does this imprint tell us about the owner of the seal?’ The point is, that this owner may have been named after the Utu, like the next two kings:
Ur-Utu (or Lugal-melem) (‘the son of Ur-gigir’)* 25 years
Utu-hengal conflicting dates (427 years / 26 years / 7 years) c. 2055–2048 BC (short) defeats Tirigan and the Gutians, appoints Ur-Namma governor of Ur
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List
And thus he may be engendered by Nanna (another name of the moon god) just like UrNanna:
A praise poem of Ur-Namma (Ur-Namma C): c.2.4.1.3 I am the creature of Nanna! I am the older brother of Gilgameš! I am the son borne by Ninsumun, a princely seed! For me, kingship came down from heaven! Sweet is the praise of me, the shepherd Ur-Namma!
In this praise poem ‘Ninsumun’, (Lady of the wild cows), is the mother of Ur-Nanna instead of Ningal (Great Lady): they may have been similar.
As said before Utu and Inanna are depicted next to each other as they are brother and sister born between Aries and Taurus, but also because they are married.
When Utu is also the name of the human seal owner, then this imprint may suggest that he is the spouse of Inanna just like Išme-Dagan:
A praise poem of Išme-Dagan (Išme-Dagan A + V): c.2.5.4.01
Inanna, the lady of heaven and earth ......, chose me as her beloved spouse. She put attractiveness in my waist-belt (?), looking at me with her life-giving look, as she lifted her radiant forehead to me, to make me step onto the flowery bed.



Number 1
Here four animals form two crosses:
1. On the left a lion and a bearded bull-man form the X-sign indicating the Marriage of Suen and Ningal. 2. On the right a lion and a stag form another X-sign indicating the marriage of Utu and Inanna.
Number 1
The bull-man and stag form a vulva sign which indicates the birth of Utu (the naked young man) and Inanna (the cow between the two lions).
Number 1
The two lions together with the two horizontal lines form the ‘zal’ sign and together with the youth Utu they form the word ‘dawn’. In this way Utu and the dawn goddess Aya are united.

Number 9 Six symbolic abstract representations of external female genitals (i.e. ‘yonic’ symbols) which have been used in various historical/cultural contexts:
1) Upper left: A schematized drawing of the pubic triangle; among other things, this is the earliest archaic form of the ancient Sumerian cuneiform sign MUNUS (meaning ‘woman’); see Image:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg. The later form of this cuneiform sign is no longer pictographic, formed of four wedge shapes: Cuneiform sal.png In other contexts, the upper corners are sometimes rounded. See also the prehistoric depiction at Image:112307-BritishMuseum-Badari.jpg, and the ancient Greek at Image: NAMA Phallus ailé.jpg .
2) Upper right: A composite version of Hindu Yoni symbols. It combines features of various versions of Indian Yoni symbols (such as the one seen in Image: Lingam.jpg), but this particular shape may not itself be an authentic Hindu symbol. (For a somewhat similar symbol in a non-Hindu context, see Image:Vulve stylisée.JPG .)
3) Lower left: One form of the pointed oval encountered in many contexts as a representation or symbol of the vulva (including as part of medieval Sheela-na-gig figures). This particular version is based on a description in the book ‘Blood Brothers of Gor’, using the geometry of the Vesica Piscis configuration (i.e. the overlap between two circles of equal diameter, where the center of each circle is on the circumference of the other). For one variation of this (a pointed oval within a circle), see Image:Dina-gor.svg or Image:Triple-Goddess-Waxing-Full-Waning-Symbol-multicolored.svg .
4) Center: Oval within oval (another variation of the preceding).
5) Lower center: Quasi-original form of an Egyptian hieroglyph used in the spellings of the ancient Egyptian words for ‘woman’ and ‘vulva’ (according to James P. Allen's Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs, where it is assigned the number D280a and described as an abstract representation of the pelvis and vulva). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions, this sign is generally merged with or replaced by hieroglyphs N41
