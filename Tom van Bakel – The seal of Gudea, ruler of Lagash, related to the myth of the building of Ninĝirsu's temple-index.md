# Index for Tom van Bakel – The seal of Gudea, ruler of Lagash, related to the myth of the building of Ninĝirsu's temple.pdf

The seal of Gudea compared to the myth of the building of Ninĝirsu’s temple
Number 1
Ninsumun Gudea Ninĝišzida Ninĝirsu
This is a drawing based on two fragmentary seal impressions found in Lagash, a city state in Southern Mesopotamia. The cuneiform inscription tells us that the original seal belongs to Gudea for it is written: ‘Gudea, ruler (of) Lagash’. The image shows that Ninĝišzida and Ninsumun, his the divine parents, accompany him to Ninĝirsu, an important god of the city. Ninĝirsu (Lord of the city Ĝirsu; cuneiform ĝir2-su) sits on a throne and provide abundance.
But who is Gudea?
‘Gudea (Sumerian: 𒅗𒌤𒀀, Gu3-de2-a) was a ruler (ensi) of the state of Lagash in Southern Mesopotamia, who ruled circa 2080–2060 BC (short chronology) or 2144-2124 BC (middle chronology). He probably did not come from the city, but had married Ninalla, daughter of the ruler Ur-Baba (2164–2144 BC) of Lagash, thus gaining entrance to the royal house of Lagash. He was succeeded by his son Ur-Ningirsu. Gudea ruled at a time when the center of Sumer was ruled by the Gutian dynasty, and when Ishtup-Ilum ruled to the north in Mari. Under Gudea, Lagash had a golden age, and seemed to enjoy a high level of independence from the Gutians’.

And what about Lagash?
‘Lagash ˈleɪɡæʃ/ (cuneiform: 𒉢𒁓𒆷𒆠 LAGAŠKI; Sumerian: Lagaš), or Shirpurla, was an ancient city state located northwest of the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and east of Uruk, about 22 kilometres (14 mi) east of the modern town of Ash Shatrah, Iraq. Lagash (modern AlHiba) was one of the oldest cities of the Ancient Near East. The ancient site of Nina (Tell Zurghul) is around 10 km (6.2 mi) away and marks the southern limit of the state. Nearby Girsu (modern Telloh), about 25 km (16 mi) northwest of Lagash, was the religious center of the Lagash state. Lagash's main temple was the E-ninnu, dedicated to the god Ningirsu. Lagash seems to have incorporated the ancient cities of Girsu, Nina, Uruazagga and Erim’.

The most interesting thing about the drawing is that it can be understood from the texts written on these two cylinders, made after Gudea's death..
‘Cylinder A opens with an introduction which recites an appeal of the city Lagash to the god Enlil and the (priest-)lord Ningirsu, to restore the cult and temple Eninnu, whose neglect had afflicted the land with a drought, a scarcity of water for irrigation purposes.’
The Great Cylinder Inscriptions A & B of Gudea Translated by Ira Maurice Price
After the temple was completed Gudea invited Ninĝirsu and his spouse Bau to take possession of it:
‘Cylinder B records the episodes after the completion of the temple, when the god and his spouse, the goddess Bau, were officially invited to take possession of the temple. The major rite led up to
the hierogamy, or sacred marriage, of the divine couple. This was a fertility rite which guaranteed
the renewal of life in all its forms - human, animals, and plants. When the goddess married her spouse, the sun returned to Sumer, providing abundant crops for the following year.’

‘The major rite led up to the hierogamy, or sacred marriage, of the divine couple. This was a fertility rite which guaranteed the renewal of life in all its forms’:
‘Large bronze plates (?) offered all sorts of food (?). In the good house ...... were cooked in shining
bronze vessels (?). Its pure bowls standing in the great dining hall were troughs in various sizes that never lack water, and the goblets beside them were the Tigris and Euphrates continually
carrying abundance’.

Let's investigate the persons on this drawing more precisely.
On the seal Gudea is depicted as a simple shepherd without crown or sceptre as he is mentioned ‘the true shepherd’ in the cylinder inscription:
‘The true shepherd Gudea is wise, and able too to realize things.’
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
The god with serpents is Ninĝišzida: according to the cylinder inscription he held Gudea by the hand throughout the time:
‘Lugal-kur-dub walked in front of him, Ig-alim directed him and Ninĝišzida, his personal god, held
him by the hand throughout the time.’
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
As the (rising) sun he will lead Gudea to success:
‘The sun which rose for thee over the hosts of mankind is thy god, Ningizzida, as the (rising) sun, he
will lead thee to success.’
The Great Cylinder Inscriptions A & B of Gudea, Cylinder A, 5 Translated by Ira Maurice Price
As the sun and at daytime he always seemed to move along with Gudea. This well-known phenomena still occurs every day: because of its distance, the sun always seems to move along with every one of us, wherever we go.

His friendly protecting genius followed him:
The true shepherd Gudea is wise, and able too to realise things. His friendly guardian went before him and his friendly protecting genius followed him. For his master, Lord Ninĝirsu, Gudea gave numerous gifts to the house of yore, the old house, his dwelling place. He went into the E-ninnu to the lord, and prayed to him:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
The god Ninĝirsu is seated on a throne causing abundance, symbolized by streams of water that fill the bowls:
‘Large bronze plates (?) offered all sorts of food (?). In the good house ...... were cooked in shining
bronze vessels (?). Its pure bowls standing in the great dining hall were troughs in various sizes that never lack water, and the goblets beside them were the Tigris and Euphrates continually
carrying abundance’.
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B)
Earlier he promised this abundance to Gudea when he would set to work on his house and would lay foundations of his temple:
‘When you, true shepherd Gudea, really set to work for me on my house, the foremost house of all
lands, the right arm of Lagaš, the Anzud bird roaring on the horizon, the E-ninnu, my royal house, I
will call up to heaven for humid winds so that plenty comes down to you from heaven and the land
will thrive under your reign in abundance.’
‘Laying the foundations of my temple will bring immediate abundance: the great fields will grow
rich for you, the levees and ditches will be full to the brim for you, the water will rise for you to
heights never reached by the water before. Under you more oil than ever will be poured and more wool than ever will weighed in Sumer.’
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B)

‘Under the cartouche of the legend, a dragon passing to the right: a winged quadruped with anterior lion limbs, posterior hindquarters of a raptor, a scorpion's tail.’
Ninĝišzida is characterized by two dragon heads erected above his shoulders. These heads are similar to the head of the winged dragon
depicted under the cartouche, which means that this winged dragon represents Ninĝišzida too. The two wings symbolized that the sun god Ninĝišzida passed the constellation Corvus, which happened in June/July.
Ninĝišzida is spelled: dnin-g̃iš-zid-da. In Sumer the word for ‘tree’ is ‘gis’ or ‘gish,’ which
also means penis:
‘Because of the Sumerian writing the origin are picture symbols, we find, that gis or gish is a penis
as well as a tree.
The Sumerian word Nin_gish_zi_ da means 'giving life from the penis’ but also ‘giving life from a tree’. Nin_gish_zi_da is equal to ‘Du_mu_zi’, what is known in Hebrew as Tammuz and means ‘son/man who is life’. The Sumerian Zi or Ti means ‘life’. Zi is also the Sumerian ‘Breath of life’ and Nin-ti is the Sumerian ‘she who makes live’, where Nin is often related to a woman, but also to the meaning of ‘giving’ or ‘supporter’. Nin-Tu is the Sumerain ‘birth-giver’.’
See: Beyond the slavery of religions: www.volker-doormann.org/slavery.htm
So Ninĝišzida can be associated with the word penis and a penis of course can be associated with insemination and creation. And thus it is not surprising that Ninĝišzida is the divine father of Gudea:
‘Your god, Lord Ninĝišzida, is the grandson of An; your divine mother is Ninsumun, the bearing mother of good offspring, who loves her offspring; you are a child born by the true cow.
You are a true youth made to rise over the land of Lagaš by Ninĝirsu; your name is established from below to above.
Gudea, nobody ...... what you say. You are ...... a man known to An.
You are a true ruler, for whom the house has determined a good fate. Gudea, son of Ninĝišzida, you will enjoy a long life!’

In June/July, when passing the constellation Corvus, the sun god Ninĝišzida may have created Gudea. Being created in June Gudea may have been born in March, when the sun passed Taurus.
‘His friendly protecting genius’ wears a horned headdress, which suggests that she represents Ninsun or Ninsumun, who is the divine mother of Gudea:
‘Your god, Lord Ninĝišzida, is the grandson of An;
your divine mother is Ninsumun, the bearing mother of good offspring, who loves her offspring; you are a child
born by the true cow’.
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
Ninsun or Ninsumun meant ‘Lady of the wild cows,’ which means that Gudea was born in Taurus. At that time this constellation indicated March.
‘Ninsumun's name was originally read Ninsun. More recently the reading Ninsumun has been proven to be more accurate (Wilcke 1998-2001: 501-2). The name appears to be a genitive construction, meaning ‘Lady of the wild cows’ (Wilcke ibid.).’
http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/ninsumun/
In ‘The Great Cylinder Inscriptions A & B of Gudea,’ on page 36, Price writes that in ‘Die Religion Babyloniens u. Assyriens’ M. Jastrow identifies Ninsun as Ishtar. And according to Kugler the goddess Ishtar is identical to Sirius. He writes that at 3000 BC she lives in the bonds of love with Tammuz from her heliacal setting, about April 1st, to her heliacal rising about June 20th,
‘According to Kugler p. 244 Sternkunde Ishtar-Sirius lives in the bonds of love with Tammuz from
her heliacal setting, about May 1st, to her heliacal rising about July 20th, [calculated at 3000 BC,
from April 1st to June 20th]. This is exactly the period of luxuriant vegetation and of animal pairing.’
Sumerian and Babylonian psalms by Stephen Langdon, ph. D.
If Ninsun is identical to Ishtar as well as to Sirius then in March she is the evening star ‘following’ the sun. And thus Ninsumun alias the ‘friendly protecting genius’ may also ‘follow’ the steps of Gudea:
‘His friendly guardian went before him and his friendly protecting genius followed him’. The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And like the sun Ninsumun also seems to move along with Gudea wherever he goes.

Number 1
Ninsumun Gudea Ninĝišzida Ninĝirsu
Gudea arranged a rich banquet for Lord Ninĝirsu, who entered his new house:
‘For the warrior who entered his new house, for Lord Ninĝirsu, he arranged a rich banquet. He seated An at the place of honour for him, he seated Enlil next to An and Ninmaḫ next to Enlil.’
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And then, rejoicing over the house, the seated Ninĝirsu determined a fate for the temple:
‘Rejoicing over the house, the owner determined a fate for the brickwork of Eninnu: ‘O brickwork of E-ninnu, let there be a good fate determined, brickwork of E-ninnu, let there be a fate determined, let there be a good fate determined! House! Mountain founded by An, built in grandeur!’ ‘House ...... embers (?) ...... embracing heaven. ...... holy .......’
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
He also determines a fate for Gudea, who, as always, is accompanied by Ninsumun and Ninĝišzida:
‘On your behalf, numerous cow-pens will be erected and many sheepfolds renewed!
The people will lie down in safe pastures, enjoying abundance under you.
The eyes of Sumer and all the countries will be directed toward you. An will elevate your house of Anzud for you.
3 lines fragmentary ‘...... grown as tall as Gilgameš. No one shall remove its throne set up there. Your god, Lord Ninĝišzida, is the grandson of An; your divine mother is Ninsumun, the bearing mother of good offspring, who loves her offspring; you are a child born by the true cow.
You are a true youth made to rise over the land of Lagaš by Ninĝirsu; your name is established from below to above.
Gudea, nobody ...... what you say. You are ...... a man known to An. You are a true ruler, for whom the house has determined a good fate. Gudea, son of Ninĝišzida, you will enjoy a long life!’

Number 3
Gudea Ninĝišzida Anuna Ninĝirsu Anuna
The initiation of the temple was a highlight in the life of Gudea. It is depicted on the cylinder seal and this damaged stela may also show that the seated Ninĝirsu, rejoicing over the house, causes abundance and determines a fate for the temple and for Gudea, who is accompanied by Ninĝišzida. Two Anuna gods, standing next to Ninĝirsu, may pray to him on behalf of Gudea:
‘He went to the Anuna gods and prayed to them: ‘O all you Anuna gods, admired by the land of
Lagaš, protectors of all the countries, whose command, a massive breach in a dam, carries away any who try to stop it. The worthy young man on whom you have looked will enjoy a long life. I, the shepherd, built the house, and now I will let my master enter his house. O Anuna gods, may you
pray on my behalf!’

Number 4
‘Gudea, ruler of Lagash, Lugal-me, scribe, your servant.’
This drawing may depict the induct of the scribe Lugal-me: during a ceremony the sun god Utu, may decree that this Lugal-me will be the servant of Gudea, ruler of Lagash. In the Ancient Near East scribes were very important persons, for instance: they regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings:
‘Its king, the shepherd Naram-Suen, rose as the daylight on the holy throne of Agade. Its city wall like a mountain, reached the heavens. It was like the Tigris going to the sea as holy Inana opened the portals of its city-gates and made Sumer bring its own possessions upstream by boats. The highland Martu, people ignorant of agriculture, brought spirited cattle and kids for her. The Meluḫans, the people of the black land, brought exotic wares up to her. Elam and Subir loaded themselves with
goods for her as if they were pack asses. All the governors, the temple administrators, and the
accountants of the Guedina regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings. What a
weariness all these caused at Agade's city gates! Holy Inana could hardly receive all these offerings. As if she were a citizen there, she could not restrain (?) the desire (?) to prepare the ground for a temple.’

Number 5
‘Gudea, ruler of Lagash; Abba, scribe, your servant.’
And this drawing may depict the induct of scribe Abba: during a ceremony a goddess (Nisaba the goddess of writing?), may decree that this Abba will be the servant of Gudea, ruler of Lagash. Again, a scribe was an important man: his status was of a man who had five son:
Gilgameš, Enkidu and the nether world
‘Did you see him who had one son?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He weeps bitterly at the wooden peg which was driven into his wall.’ ‘Did you see him who had two sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He sits on a couple of bricks, eating bread.’ ‘Did you see him who had three sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He drinks water from a saddle water-skin.’ ‘Did you see him who had four sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘His heart rejoices like a man who has
four asses to yoke.’ ‘Did you see him who had five sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘Like a good scribe he is indefatigable, he enters the palace easily.’ ‘Did you see him who had six sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He is a cheerful as a ploughman.’ ‘Did you see him who had seven sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘As a companion of the gods, he sits on a throne and listens to judgments.’

‘Gudea, ruler of Lagash; Abba the scribe, your servant.’
And this drawing may also depict the induct of a scribe who also is called Abba: during a ceremony a goddess (Nisaba again?), may decree that this Abba will be the servant of Gudea, ruler of Lagash. Scribes are wise because of the tablets of Nisaba. And Nisaba comes forth like the sun for him:
‘May your exceeding wisdom, given by the tablets of Nisaba, never cease on the clay in the tablet house. In this tablet house, like a shrine fashioning everything, may it never come to an end. May Nisaba, the shining ...... lady, give wisdom to the junior scribe who puts his hand to the clay and writes this on it. May she show generosity. In the place of writing may she come forth like the sun for him.’

King Šulgi writes that he is a knowledgeable scribe of Nisaba:
‘I am a knowledgeable scribe of Nisaba; I have perfected my wisdom just as my heroism and my strength . Reliable words can reach (?) me. I cherish righteousness but do not tolerate wickedness. I hate anyone who speaks wickedly.’
A praise poem of Šulgi (Šulgi A): c.2.4.2.01
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
Once again, writing appears to be important to him:
‘When I was small, I was at the academy, where I learned the scribal art from the tablets of Sumer and Akkad. None of the nobles could write on clay as I could. There where people regularly went for tutelage in the scribal art, I qualified fully in subtraction, addition, reckoning and accounting. The fair Nanibgal, Nisaba,
provided me amply with knowledge and comprehension. I am an experienced scribe who does not neglect a
thing.’

Number 7
Ninsumun Lu-Dumuzi Gudea Lu-Dumuzi, son of Mani, cupbearer of god Gudea
This drawing of a damaged cylinder seal may depict the inauguration of Lu-Dumuzi as a cupbearer of the deified Gudea. On the seal Lu-Dumuzi obviously is vanished: originally he may have been standing between Ninsumun and the seated god. This god looks like a statue of Gudea.
Number 8
4’The seal is dated to Shu-Sin in the Ur III period, so after the death of Gudea, when he was
worshiped as a god. The sign diĝir appears before his name in the upper right corner, indicating
divinity. The sign was not used before Gudea's name during his lifetime. He was worshiped as a god only after his death.’
See: http://sumerianshakespeare.com/44701.html
So after his death, and being a god Gudea decrees a fate for Lu-Dumuzi, who has to serve him.

‘Gudea, ruler of Lagash: Ur-Sharurra, son of Ur-Suena, servant.’
This drawing of a cylinder seal may depict the inauguration of UrSharurra as a servant of the deified Gudea. Once again, the seated god looks like the above statue of Gudea.
‘This is a cylinder seal impression of Ur-Sharura, a functionary in the temple of Gudea. It is dated to Shu-Sin in the Ur III period, after the death of Gudea, when he was worshiped as a god. The sign diĝir appears before his name in the upper right corner, indicating divinity. The sign was not used before Gudea's name during his lifetime. He was worshiped as a god only after his death.’
See: http://sumerianshakespeare.com/44701.html
So after his death, when he was a god, Gudea decreed a fate for Ur-Sharurra, who had to serve him.

Number 10
‘Gimil-Sin, strong hero, king of Ur, king of the four regions: Galu-annatu, scribe, son of Khesh[ag], thy servant.’
And this drawing may depict that during a ceremony Gimil-Sin, who looks like the statue of Gudea, may decree that the scribe Galu-annatu will be his servant. Scribes also have the task to glorify the king:
‘Lipit-Eštar, Enlil's son, you have made every mouth speak of your righteousness. The tablets will forever speak your praise in the e-dub-baa. May the scribes ...... and glorify you greatly! May eulogies of you never cease in the e-dub-ba-a! Perfect shepherd, youthful son of Enlil, Lipit-Eštar, be praised!’

Published: Art of the First Cities: The Third Millennium B.C. from the Mediterranean to the Indus, By Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)
On a cubic seat whose ornamentation has almost entirely disappeared, a god (Enki?), Wearing the tulle of the hulticorne and dressed in kaunakes, sits in profile to the left. With his left hand, brought back to his waist, he holds by the neck a vase from which flow two waves rising above his shoulders; One falls backwards into a similar vessel placed on the ground; The other is going to throw himself into one of the two waves which spring forth on the right and left of a sacred plant with three stems, of a third vase which the god holds in front in his right hand. The footstool of his throne is formed by two vases, the undulating waters of which slip below the siege, spread out in four waves, which merge with those which spring from the vessel placed behind. The ishakku, shaved head and clad in fringed shawl, raises his right hand to the height of his face; His left hand, open in profile and his wrist held by his personal boss, the god Ningizida, who presents it to the god. Ningizida is characterized by two dragon heads erected above his shoulders; He is dressed in kaunakes and wearing the multicorne tiara; Her long hair is raised in a large bun; His free hand is not raised, as might be expected, but is placed under the body of the vessel which the god of the abyss holds by the neck and seems to bear it. Behind the scene, near the ishakku, a goddess wearing the tiara with horns and dressed in Shawl with vertical stripes, makes the gesture of adoration. Legend: ‘Gudea, ruler of Lagash.’ Under the cartouche of the legend, a dragon passing to the right: a winged quadruped with anterior lion limbs, posterior hindquarters of a raptor, a scorpion's tail; Its flat head, with its forked tongue, is crowned with the hat with two horns and double egret, stylization of the divine tiara, and on the side it is adorned.
