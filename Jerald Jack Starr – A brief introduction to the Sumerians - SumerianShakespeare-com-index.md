A brief introduction to the Sumerians
18-23 minutes
The original "Stairway to Heaven". The grand staircase of the great
ziggurat at Ur. The temple was dedicated to Nanna, the moon god.
The Sumerians were the most extraordinary people who ever lived on the
face of the earth. They seemed to come from out of nowhere, and they
single-handedly invented civilization when most of the rest of the world
was still living in the Stone Age. What’s more, they did it
thousands of years before anyone else. In regard to the Sumerians, you
will need to revise your concept of ancient in comparison to the "ancient"
Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. The Sumerian civilization was already
ancient when it ended in 2004 B.C., twenty centuries before Julius Caesar,
sixteen centuries before Socrates, and seven centuries before
Tutankhamen.
At the dawn of history, the Egyptians were the only people with a
civilization comparable to that of the Sumerians (although the Sumerian
civilization was much older). There has been some debate on whether they

created their civilizations independently or if they cooperated
with each other. The historic record seems to indicate that they built their
civilizations independently. There is no mention of the Egyptians in the
Sumerian archives, or vice-versa, and there is no direct evidence they had
a noticeable influence on one another, except for their propensity to build
giant pyramids and ziggurats. Though on a modern map they seem
to be quite close, they never had any direct contact with each other.
Back then, the world
was a much larger place. The only contact between the two great
civilizations was through
intermediary traders. (See the page on The Gebel el-Arak Knife.)
Statuettes from the Ubaid period, the prehistoric era of the Sumerians.
This kind of statue, along with the Sumerians' sudden rise to civilization,
has caused some people to speculate that the Sumerians were assisted by
aliens from outer space.
What’s so remarkable about the Sumerians’ invention of civilization is
they did it with so few natural resources. Like the Egyptians, the
Sumerians did not have a lot of timber; so it’s somewhat surprising that
the world’s first civilizations should arise where there isn't a plentiful
supply of wood, which could be used for fuel, the construction of houses,
and for many of the utilitarian items needed in daily life. Unlike the

Egyptians, however, the Sumerians did not have a lot of stone
(imagine Egyptian civilization without its endless supply of stone). Neither
did the Sumerians have much mineral wealth. The only thing they had in
abundance was mud, but with that mud they built a great civilization. For
with that mud they built towering ziggurats, and on that mud they
invented writing.
Examples of Sumerian technological inventions include the wheel, copper,
bronze, the arch, sailboats, lunar calendars, sundials, saws, chisels,
hammers, rivets, sickles, hoes, glue (bitumen), swords and scabbards,
harnesses, armor, musical instruments (the lyre and harp), chariots, the
kiln, sun-dried and kiln-fired bricks (mixed with straw to give them
greater strength), the pottery wheel, printing, plows, metal cooking pots,
and (last but not least) beer. There are probably numerous other items
that the Sumerians invented for which they haven’t received proper credit.
Basically anything that the Sumerians used, which had not already
been invented in the Stone Age, they had to invent for themselves.
They also invented civilization in the literal sense of the word.
“Civilization” is derived from the Roman word civitas, meaning “city”. The
first large cities in the world were Sumerian.
Artist reconstruction of the city of Ur, by Balage Balogh. A Sumerian
tablet, written with a kind of worldly discontent, speaks of "the city, where
the tumult of man is." In one of the first cities of the world, someone was
already complaining about the hustle and bustle of city life.

The Sumerians also invented the more fundamental aspects of civilization:
writing, arithmetic, geometry, monumental architecture, irrigation
systems and large scale farming (mono-crops), sewage systems, schools,
dictionaries, literature, realistic human portraiture, business accounting,
the division of labor, and professional armies.
The Sumerian achievements in mathematics are particularly impressive
considering the fact that they used the cumbersome sexagesimal number
system, based on the number 60, rather than the simpler decimal system
(base 10) that we use today. Sumerian mathematics is why we still divide a
circle into 360 degrees. The above tablet, from Shuruppak, is dated in
the 27th century B.C. It is the oldest known mathematical text. It's a table
of computations showing the areas of six rectangles where the length is 60
times greater than the width. The tablet didn't have a practical purpose.
It's an example of mathematics for its own sake.
Inscription carved in stone: "Ur-Namma, the king of Ur, he who built

the temple of Nanna" refers to the great ziggurat at Ur. When this
inscription was written, Ur-Namma was just the king of Ur. He had not yet
become the king of Sumer and Akkad.
The necessity of having to irrigate large tracts of non-arable land seems to
be what first compelled the Sumerians to invent their modern society.
This required a division of labor under the direction of a central authority
(government). It also necessitated a means to pay
for the project (taxation, i.e., “donations” of grain, sheep, cattle, dry goods,
etc.) and a method to record these payments, which required the invention
of writing. The land had to be allotted to different citizens, the water rights
managed, and the surplus food distributed to the people.
Once a large labor force was mobilized, construction on
a monumental scale soon followed (such as palaces, great temples, and
city walls), along with the manufacture of the other
necessities of civilization (tools, clothing, weapons, luxury goods, artistic
works, and so on). The early administrative systems were centered at the
temples, each ruled by a high priest. Later, when the city-states became
more powerful and competitive, the government was controlled by a king
(lugal, meaning “man-great”) who could also command large armies.
The Sumerians’ single-handed invention of civilization, their remarkable
achievements in science, and their lasting influence on the modern world,
is all the more extraordinary
when you consider the fact that Sumer, even at its widest extent, was
smaller than the
state of Connecticut.
Sumerian civilization lasted for 2,000 years, which is almost twice as long
as the Romans.
Sumerian kings modeled themselves on the ideal of a shepherd. The
"shepherd kings"
were crucial to the success of Sumer. You cannot understand the Sumerian
civilization until you understand the shepherd kings. See The Shepherd
Kings on this website.

ki-en-gi (Sumer)
Technically, it is Sumer, not "Sumeria". Sumeria is a modern literary
word. It’s not known exactly what the Sumerians called themselves.
“Sumer” is a corruption of the Akkadian word Shumeru. The signs for
Sumer are written as ki-en-gi. Ki means “land”, en means “lord”, and gi
means "civilized". Sumer is the “Land of Civilized Lords”.

Gudea, the ruler of Lagash. His crown is a shepherd's hat.
Sumerian civilization arose in the fertile region of Mesopotamia between
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the 5th millennium BC. (the word
Mesopotamia means “between
the rivers”). Because the Sumerians seemed to have appeared so suddenly
on the scene, and because their language is unrelated to other languages of
the region (or to any language in the world, then or now) it was originally
believed that they were foreign invaders who subjugated the indigenous
people already living there. This, however, seems unlikely. It
was very difficult for conquerors to impose their language on a native
people, and it’s doubtful that the Sumerians could last for thousands of
years, through every kind of vicissitude, if they had forced their civilization
on an unwilling population. The Sumerians were probably a nomadic
people who decided to settle in this region and become farmers. No one
knows where they came from. Theories range from India, Caucasia, Iran,
Africa, Turkistan, Tibet (?!), you name it. After years of academic debate,
no definitive conclusion has been reached. However, it seems the
Sumerians were distinct from the Semitic neighbors that surrounded them
(the Akkadians, Elamites (Iranians), Gutians, Hamazi, etc.). It's highly
improbable that the Sumerians were ethnically the same
as their neighbors but spoke a language that is completely different. Not
only was their language different, but their statues and portraits suggest
the Sumerians were Caucasians, who originated from the area around the
Caspian Sea. The Semites, on the other hand, originated from the Arab
Peninsula. Remarkably, the Sumerians were later able to maintain
their ethno-cultural identity during two centuries of Akkadian domination

(2350 – 2150 B.C.) after they were conquered by Sargon the Great. During
that time it would have been so easy for the Sumerians to be assimilated,
to “blend back in”, if they were like their neighbors. Instead, they regained
their independence and began the Neo-Sumerian Revival, the
ultimate expression of Sumerian civilization.
At first there was very little conflict between the Sumerian city-states. As
they became larger and more powerful, their rivalry intensified and they
often resorted to civil war to settle their differences. The wars were fought
for territory and for the control of water rights. The most
famous conflict involved the cities of Umma and Lagash in a contest for
possession of the Guedena, the fertile plain that lay between them. This
conflict lasted for many generations. The many civil wars fought between
the different city-states, too numerous to recount here,
make Sumerian history similar to the history of the rest of the world.

history, see Allmesopotamia.

Not only did the Sumerians have to contend with each other, they also had
to deal with the Akkadians. Akkad was the region located northwest of
Sumer. The histories of Sumer and Akkad are inextricably tied together.
The relationship was sometimes symbiotic, sometimes bloody. They spoke
different languages, but through the centuries developed a kind of
bilingualism, using the same (Sumerian) sign system and
exchanging many "loan words" between them. They shared many cultural
and religious values, and they benefited from their mutual trade. At other
times they were locked in bloody combat, each seeking domination and
control of the other. The “King of Kish”, named for a city in Akkad,
became the traditional title of any king who ruled both Sumer and Akkad.
The title meant "The King of Kings", and it was claimed by many
Sumerians and Akkadians during their long history together. In the words
of The King List, a Babylonian record of the dynasties of the region, “the
kingship was taken” from Kish, then returned to Kish many different
times (the kingship could also be carried to a foreign land after an
invasion). Fortunately, the Sumerians and the Akkadians never waged
“total war” against each other. They never tried to destroy each other in
wars of extermination, or to enslave the populations. Instead, the losing

side simply became a vassal state of the winning side. The losers also had
to pay taxes (tribute) to the victors. Sometimes the Akkadians were in the
ascendency, sometimes the Sumerians. Thus their history continued
for hundreds of years.

from Eannatum's Vulture Stele. Sumerian soldiers were the best soldiers
in Mesopotamia. They had to be,
if Sumer was to survive. The Sumerians invented the modern, professional
army, where the soldiers are identically armed and equipped, as provided
by the state, rather than individual warriors bringing their own weapons
to the battlefield. They attack in a disciplined formation. This isn't the
disorganized mob of individual combatants that is typical of the more
primitive forms of warfare.

north and northeast. The Gutians were nomadic tribesmen from the
Zagros Mountains. They were barbarian warriors who didn't want
to govern an empire; they were far more interested in looting and sacking
cities. The Elamites were a bit more civilized (though still barbarians in
the eyes of the Sumerians) who originated in the area now known as Iran.
They often conquered parts of Sumer and Akkad, and they
would later be instrumental in the final destruction of Sumerian
civilization. The many wars in this region, between the Sumerians,
Akkadians, Gutians, and Elamites, along with the
Hamazi and others, prompted the writer of The King List to ask, “Then
who was the king? Who was not the king?"

Kish.
In 2350 B.C. the Sumerians were conquered by Sargon the Great, the
Akkadian king who went on to conquer all of Mesopotamia. He defeated
the united armies of Sumer in two
pitched battles and captured Lugalzagesi, the Sumerian king who had
united (or conquered)
all of Sumer and earned the title of “King of Kish”. Sargon brought the
captured Lugalzagesi to the city of Nippur in a neck stock. The Akkadians
continued to rule Sumer for the next two centuries. Though Sumer was
now a vassal state, it was not treated with undue severity because
Akkadians and Sumerians shared many of the same cultural and religious
values. For instance, although the Akkadian language became the lingua
franca of Mesopotamia,
it was written with the Sumerian sign system. Nonetheless, the Sumerians
were no longer in control of their own destiny. Two hundred years is a
long time to be a subject nation (about as long as America is old) so it's

somewhat surprising that the Sumerians never lost their core identity,
their sense of self.
Ur-Namma. King of Ur. King of Sumer and
Akkad.
In 2150 B.C. the Akkadian Empire was destroyed by the Gutians, who also
conquered many parts of Sumer. The Sumerians rose up in rebellion
under the leadership of Utu-hengal, the king whose city of Uruk was also
to be destroyed by the Gutians. Thus the Sumerians’ desire
for independence, which had been smoldering beneath the surface for 200
years, was again rekindled. Utu-hengal defeated the Gutians and captured
their king, Tirigan. Utu-hengal died seven years later (under mysterious
circumstances). The Sumerian battle standard was then passed to Ur
Namma, the king of Ur. He went on to gain more victories against the
Gutians. He also united the Sumerian cities into a single nation and he
later reconquered Akkad. So once again the nations were united, except
this time the roles were reversed; now the Sumerians were the rulers and
the Akkadians were the vassals. Like a phoenix, Sumer had risen from the
ashes. Now began the Neo-Sumerian Revival, the apex of Sumerian
civilization.
The most important kings of the Neo-Sumerian Revival were Gudea, Ur
Namma, and his son Shulgi. The histories of Gudea and Ur-Namma are
given elsewhere on this website. Shulgi began his reign with a punitive
expedition against Gutium after his father was killed in combat
in yet another battle with the Gutians. For the next twenty years he
reigned in relative peace. At some point during his reign he stopped
calling himself “The King of Sumer and Akkad”, the title his father had
used, and began to use the appellation of "King of the Four Quarters [of

Heaven]". This was the title used by some Akkadian kings to proclaim
their divinity and their dominion over an earthly empire. It suggests that
Shulgi began to have the same ambitions. The second half of his reign is
marked by several wars with foreign enemies, which necessitated the
building of a defensive wall around the borders. Despite this, he gave the
Sumerian people 47 years of unparalleled prosperity and he also
continued the artistic renaissance that had begun with the reign of Gudea.
Shulgi tablet dedicated to the goddess Inanna.
After the reigns of his successors, Amar-Suen and Shu-Suen, things
started to fall apart. First there was drought, then famine. Amorite
tribesmen from the land of Martu started migrating from the west in
overwhelming numbers. The Gutians were attacking from the north, and
the Elamites were menacing the east. Ibbi-Suen, the last king of Ur
Namma’s dynasty, was besieged on all sides. He appealed for help from
Ishbi-erra, the king of Isin. Ishbi-erra kept promising assistance that
he never delivered. He took twenty talents of silver for desperately
needed grain supplies, then kept the money and the grain for himself. As it
turns out, he had his own designs on the throne of Sumer. Then in the
ultimate betrayal, while Ibbi-Suen was fighting the enemies of Sumer in
the north, Ishbi-erra switched alliances, leaving Ibbi-Suen
outflanked in the south.
The end came quickly, and catastrophically, in 2004 B.C. All the cities of
Sumer were sacked and plundered by the Gutians and the Elamites. Ibbi
Suen, the last of the Sumerian kings, was placed in a neck stock and taken
to the Elamite capital. He was later executed.
At the time, despite the totality of their defeat, the Sumerians probably
didn’t realize that the show was finally over. They had been conquered
several times before, but they had always risen again to their former glory.
This time, there would not be a Sumerian resurrection.

battled for regional supremacy. Eventually the Akkadians gained the
ascendency. The few surviving Sumerians were assimilated into the
Akkadian kingdoms. The Sumerians were no longer a distinct
and independent people. After 1800 B.C., Sumerian ceased to be a spoken
language.

painting are given in the Images section. The painting is typically
Sumerian in its subject matter and appearance (except for the
clothes). The picture shows the continuing influence of Sumerian
civilization two centuries after it was destroyed.
The Akkadians later became known as Babylonians. The Babylonians
considered themselves to be the inheritors of the Sumerian civilization.
They adopted Sumerian history as their own. They worshiped many of the
same gods (though under different names), continued many
Sumerian cultural traditions, and they still used the Sumerian sign system
for the language of religion and the court.
After several hundred years, the Babylonian Empire was destroyed in
history’s endless cycle of the rise and fall of civilizations. With the final
collapse of the Babylonian Empire, all memory of the Sumerians
disappeared. The modern world didn't even know of the Sumerians
until the late 19th century A.D., when archaeological expeditions started
unearthing thousands of Sumerian tablets. At first the tablets were
thought to be Babylonian or Assyrian because no one had ever heard of
the Sumerians. Now, after a century of scholarly research, a portrait of the
Sumerians has finally emerged from the dim shadows of the ancient past.
Their extraordinary civilization has once again been resurrected.
