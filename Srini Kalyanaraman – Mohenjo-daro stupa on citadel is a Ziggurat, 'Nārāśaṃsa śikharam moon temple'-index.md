Is it possible that the Ziggurat of Mohenjo-daro was also a Moon temple like the Ziggurat of Ur dedicated to Naramsit or Nanna? Further archaeological work is needed to confirm this possibility Prima facie, the Mohenjopdaro Ziggurat seems to an extension of the masive burntbrick structures such as the nearby Great Bath.
Giovanni Verardi, retired archaeologist from the Univ. of Naples argues that the massive structure of burnt-bricks, the so-0called stupa may in fact be a construction during the Indus period. If so, this may be a Ziggurat constructed ca. 2500 BCE, a few centuries earlier than the Ziggurat of Ur.
Nārāśaṃsa 'moon divinity' is comparable to Namrasit, 'rising moon divinity' in Sumerian tradition.
nārāśaṃsa 'of a class of Pitṛs or Manes'; namrasit (nanna, moon divinity) also signifies veneration of ancestors. Namrasit at times assumed the character of a god of the dead , as he sank below the horizon during the course of the day. Namrasit thus had the power to enter the realm of the dead.
After the death of Enkidu , Namrasit received a sacrificial gift from Gilgameš :
" 139 On [...] from [...] [...]. 140 he submitted for Namrasit, the adviser of the gods, to the Šamaš : 141 May Namrasit, the adviser of the gods, receive this (gift). 142 In the face of my friend he was so full of joy 143 that he was walking by his side. "

There is another Sumerian moon god named Nanna .The Ziggurat of Ur is a temple of Nanna, moon divinity.
"The Great Ziggurat of Ur (Sumerian: ฀฀฀฀ or “Etemenniguru,” meaning “temple whose foundation creates aura”) is a Sumerian ziggurat – or step pyramid – built in the city of Ur in the 21st Century BCE – or about 4000 years ago. Construction started circa 2050-2030 BC and was completed circa 2030-1980 BCE"

Nanna's parents, Enlil and Ninlil
https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Sin_(mythology)
"Nanna, also called Sîn (or Suen) was a Sumerian god who played a longstanding role in Mesopotamian religion and mythology. He was the god of the moon, the son of the sky god Enlil and the grain goddess Ninlil. His sacred city was Ur, and temples dedicated to him have been found throughout Mesopotamia. The daughters of Mesopotamian kings were often assigned to be his high priestess.The worship of Nanna was associated with the breeding of cattle, which was a key part of the economy of the lower Euphrates valley. Known as Nanna in Sumer, he was named Sîn (contracted from Su-en) in the later civilizations of Babylonia and Assyria, where he had a major temple in Harran. His wife was the reed goddess Ningal ("Great Lady"), who bore him Shamash (Sumerian: Utu, "Sun") and Ishtar (Inanna), the goddess of love and war. In later centuries, he became part of an astral triad consisting of himself and his two great children, representing the positions of sun and morning star (Venus). In art, his symbols are the crescent moon, the bull, and the tripod. In his anthropomorphized form, Sîn had a beard made of lapis lazuli and rode on a winged bull...In Mesopotamian mythology, Nanna was the son of the sky god Enlil and and the grain goddess Ninlil. Nanna's origin myth is a story of his father's passion and his mother's sacrificial love. The virgin Ninlil bathes in the sacred river, where she is seen by the "bright eye" of Enlil, who falls in love with her and seduces (or rapes) her. The assembly of the gods then banishes Enlil to the underworld for this transgression. Ninlil, knowing she is pregnant with the "bright seed of Sîn," follows Enlil to the world of the dead, determined that "my master's seed can go up to the heavens!" Once the moon god is born in the underworld, three additional deities are born to his parents, allowing Nanna/Suen to take his place in the skies to light up the night. Nanna's own best-known offspring were the sun god Shamash and the great goddess of love and war, Inanna, better known today as Ishtar. The moon played a key role in Mesopotamian religious culture. As it moved through its phases, people learned to keep their calendars based on the lunar month. Nanna (or Suen/Sîn) was sometimes pictured as riding his crescent moon-boat as it made its monthly journey through the skies. Some sources indicate that the moon god was called by different names according to various phases of the moon. Sîn was especially associated with the crescent moon, while the older Sumerian name Nanna was

connected either to the full or the new moon. The horns of a bull were also sometimes equated with the moon's crescent...Sîn's status was very formidable, not only in terms of the temples dedicated to him, but also in terms of astrology, which became a prominent feature of later Mesopotamian religion, and even legal matters. For an entire millennium—from 1900 to 900 B.C.E.—Sîn's name is invoked as a witness to international treaties and covenants made by the Babylonian kings. His attribute of wisdom was particularly expressed in the science of astrology, in which the observation of the moon's phases was an important factor. The centralizing tendency in Mesopotamian religion led to his incorporation in the divine triad consisting of Sîn, Shamash, and Ishtar, respectively personifying the moon, the sun, and the planet Venus. In this trinity, the moon held the central position. However, it is likely that Ishtar came to play the more important cultural role as time went on, as she rose to the key position among the Mesopotamian goddesses, while younger deities like Marduk came to predominate on the male side of the pantheon." https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Sin_(mythology)

King Melishipak I (1186–1172 B.C.E.) presents his daughter to Shamash, The crescent moon represents Sîn, while the sun and star represent Shamash and Ishtar.
"In Mesopotamian religion Shamash was the Akkadian name of the sun god, corresponding to Sumerian Utu. In mythology, Shamash was the son of the moon god Sin (known as Nanna in Sumerian), and thus the brother of the goddess Ishtar (Sumerian: Inanna), who represented the great "star" of Venus. In early inscriptions, Shamash’s consort was the goddess Aya, whose role was gradually merged with that of Ishtar. In later Babylonian astral mythology, Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar formed a major triad of divinities, which still today plays an important role in astrological systems, though under different names." https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Shamash

Namrasit ("He is radiant when he rises ") is the Sumerian name of the deity of the rising moon (so he is referred to in a text by Warad-Sin , the Elamite ruler of Larsa ; Ira M. Price, Light out of Ur - The Devotion of Elamite Kings to Sumerian Deities. Journal of the American Oriental Society 51/22, 1931, 165). In the eighth panel of the Gilgamesh epic , Namrasit was nicknamed “Counselor of the Gods”. A šu-ila text from the library of Aššurbanipal calls it "incomparable power, with inexplicable advice". Namrasit at times assumed the character of a god of the dead , as he sank below the horizon during the course of the day. Namrasit thus had the power to enter the realm of the dead.
After the death of Enkidu , Namrasit received a sacrificial gift from Gilgameš :
" 139 On [...] from [...] [...]. 140 he submitted for Namrasit, the adviser of the gods, to the Šamaš : 141 May Namrasit, the adviser of the gods, receive this (gift). 142 In the face of my friend he was so full of joy 143 that he was walking by his side. "

[quote]Nanna (also known as Nannar, Nanna-Suen, Sin, Asimbabbar, Namrasit, Inbu) is the Mesopotamian god of the moon and wisdom. He is one of the oldest gods in the Mesopotamian pantheon and is first mentioned at the very dawn of writing in the region c. 3500 BCE. His cult center was the great temple at Ur, and he is frequently mentioned in hymns and inscriptions from the Ur III Period (2047-1750 BCE) as the chief god of the pantheon with the epithet Enzu, lord of wisdom. His importance is evident in the number of inscriptions which refer to or praise him and the stories in which he features.
He was the son of Enlil and Ninlil and is their first-born after Enlil seduces Ninlil by the riverbank in the myth Enlil and Ninlil. His wife was Ningal (also Nikkal, the 'Great Lady'), a fertility goddess, and their children were Utu-Shamash (the sun god) and, in some stories, his twin sister Inanna/Ishtar (goddess of love and sexuality), Ereshkigal (Queen of the Dead), and Ishkur (also known as Adad, god of storms). An interesting aspect of this family tree is that the moon (Nanna) is the father of the sun (Utu/Shamash). It is thought this belief originated in the early days of a hunter-gatherer social structure when the moon was more important to a community for traveling by night and telling the time of the month; the sun only became more important once the people settled down and began to practice agriculture. The religious belief, then, mirrored the cultural development. Scholar Stephen Bertman writes:
The Mesopotamians thus conceived of day, illuminated by the sun, as emanating from the darkness of night and the lesser light of the moon. As the time of lovemaking, the night and the moon were linked to the goddess of the erotic. As a source of light, the moon was also viewed as humanity's protector against acts of criminality undertaken under the cover of darkness even as the illuminating and all-seeing sun was looked upon as a guardian of justice. (122)
Nanna is represented as a recumbent moon and associated with the bull and lion-dragon. He is further depicted as a seated man with a long beard of lapis lazuli, a crescent moon above him, or riding on the back of a winged bull. In many inscriptions he is represented simply by the number 30, referring to the number of days in a lunar month, and the crescent moon was regarded as his barge in which he sailed through the night sky.
He was an immensely popular god, one of the original Sumerian pantheon. His cult center was at Ur and his most famous high priestess was Enheduanna (2285-2250 BCE), although he also had an important temple at Harran in modern-day Syria where his son was Nusku, god of fire and light. Nanna, Ningal, and Nusku were worshiped as a triad, though this veneration mainly focused on the father and son.



11
Under the reign of Nabonidus (c. 556-539 BCE) the king's mother served as high priestess at Harran while his daughter held the same position at Nanna's temple in Ur. This arrangement consolidated Nabonidus' power in the same way that Sargon of Akkad (2334-2279 BCE) had earlier placed his daughter Enheduanna in her position at Ur. Nanna is repeatedly seen in ancient texts as a god who provides and unifies, and some of the most successful Mesopotamian rulers capitalized on this belief.
Names & Significance Nanna first appears under that name (whose meaning is unknown) c. 3500 BCE. He is already an important deity when he is mentioned as Sin/Suen during the reign of Sargon of Akkad and is referred to as "the illuminator." Even from this early period, he was associated with wisdom and was honored by Sargon's grandson, the great Naram-Sin (2261-2224 BCE), who took his name upon coming to the throne. Naram-Sin, considered the greatest of the Akkadian kings, was among those who understood how to use religious belief to rule most effectively.
NANNA IS REPEATEDLY SEEN IN ANCIENT TEXTS AS A GOD WHO PROVIDES & UNIFIES & SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MESOPOTAMIAN RULERS CAPITALIZED ON THIS BELIEF.
The Akkadians also knew Nanna/Sin by a number of other names, which are actually epithets such as Asimbabbar/Ashgirbabbar (possibly meaning 'embellisher' or 'he who embellishes'), Namrasit ('who shines forth'), and Inbu ('The Fruit,' possibly referring to the moon's changing shape). To the Babylonians, Nanna was the son of Marduk who created him and placed him in the sky. Lunar eclipses were thought to be caused, in some eras, by gods or demons trying to steal the moon's light, and Nanna (or in some stories Marduk) had to fight against them to restore natural order. Bertman comments on how "during the new moon when Nanna/Sin's light was not visible, the god was said to be in the netherworld, where he judged the dead" (123). At one point or another throughout Mesopotamia's long history, Nanna was king of the gods, lord of wisdom, keeper of time, guardian of the future (diviner), holder of secrets, but is always seen as the devoted son of Enlil and a protector and guardian of humanity.
Nanna in Literature Nanna/Sin is referred to at a number of points throughout The Epic of Gilgamesh where he is mentioned as the father of Shamash and Ishtar. Gilgamesh, at one point, even composes a song for Nanna, praising him for changes in life which inspire one to do great deeds. Nanna is similarly praised in other works and, in all, is closely associated with fertility and life. His role as a keeper of time (guardian of the future) is especially interesting as he understands the past as the future. In looking at the past, Nanna was able to clearly see human destiny, collectively and individually, and those who came to him for divination could alter their future for the better by accepting his counsel. In addition to his wisdom and foresight, the god also offered many other gifts to humanity.

Part of Tablet V, the Epic of Gilgamesh
Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (CC BY-NC-SA)
In the poem The Journey of Nanna to Nippur, the god is seen loading his boat at Ur with all good things to present to his father Enlil at the city of Nippur. Nanna fills his ship with trees, plants, and animals, and then makes his way upriver, stopping at five cities along the way where he is greeted and honors each one's god. Arriving at Nippur, he is greeted by Enlil's gatekeeper with joy and brought into his father's presence. Nanna and Enlil feast together, and then Nanna makes a series of requests. He asks for the river to swell with sweet water, for the fields to yield abundant harvest, for success in cultivating honey and making wine, and for a long life to enjoy these gifts in. Enlil grants his requests, and Nanna returns happily to Ur.
The poem is thought to represent the moon's association with fertility. Enlil was the King of the Gods, keeper of the Tablets of Destiny which foretold the fates of gods and mortals, and his decisions were final. His act of generosity in giving these gifts to Nanna meant that, through Nanna, they would be passed on to humanity and could not be revoked.
Nanna is depicted in a similar light in the poem The Herds of Nanna, in which he is praised as the "god of living creatures, leader of the land" and the great father of humanity. Although Enki was the creator god of the Sumerians, Nanna seems to have sometimes taken on this role as his



13
worship spread across Mesopotamia. In the poem, he is again seen as the god who gives great gifts to humanity in abundance.
The work begins with the image of Nanna taking the night sky and illuminating it as the sun does at noon. He is the close confidant of his father Enlil, who "speaks with him day and night," and confers with him on the fate of human beings. Nanna's herds are then tallied and their number written on divine tablets by Nisaba, goddess of writing and scribe of the gods, and Nanna is then praised as the god of abundance who provides, among other gifts, alcoholic drink. Ninkasi was the goddess of beer, but this role is attributed to Nanna in the poem to emphasize his importance, as beer was the most popular drink in Mesopotamia.
Ishtar's Descent into the Underworld Inscription

The god also appears in The Descent of Inanna, where he is listed as one of the deities Ninshubbur is to appeal to if Inanna does not return from the underworld, and in The Curse of Agade, the famous work of the Mesopotamian Naru Literature genre concerning Naram-Sin. In The Curse of Agade, after Naram-Sin has enraged Enlil through his ingratitude, Nanna is among the gods who try to act as mediators to spare humanity (and Naram-Sin specifically) from Enlil's wrath. His role as a protector and defender of humanity did not end with one's death, however, but continued on in the afterlife.
Nanna & Ningal The Queen of the Dead in Mesopotamian mythology was Ereshkigal, older sister of Inanna, who ruled the underworld but, generally, passed no judgment on the dead. The dead, however great or modest their lives, all went to the same dark, dreary realm under the earth when their life was finished, and there they all shared the same fate as they ate dust and drank from puddles. This had been the standard belief among the people of Mesopotamia for millennia, but during the Ur III Period, Nanna was elevated to the role of judge of the dead. Scholar Samuel Noah Kramer writes:
The moon god Nanna decreed the fate of the dead. In the nether world...were to be found "breadeating heroes" and "[beer] drinkers" who satisfy the thirst of the dead with fresh water. We learn, too, that the gods of the nether world can be called upon to utter prayers for the dead, that the personal god of the deceased and his city's god were invoked in his behalf, and that the welfare of the family of the deceased was by no means overlooked in the funerary prayers. (132)
This is quite a departure from the traditional view of the afterlife as "the land of no return" in which the dead were all made equal and lost their interest in the world of their former lives. Nanna became the bridge between the living and the dead through his judgment of their lives and intervention on the part of their families. Even so, as Kramer notes elsewhere, the Sumerians, for the most part, held to the belief that all were equal in the dreary world of the afterlife which was only a poor reflection of mortal existence.
Ningal may also have had a part in the judgment of the dead, or at least as a prompt to good behavior, as a number of artifacts have been found which are known as "eyes of Ningal." These are crafted eye models usually cut from precious or semi-precious stone but also formed from clay. Sometimes these are only eyes and sometimes a figure in which the eyes are enlarged and accentuated with what appears a lemniscate, symbol for infinity (a sideways figure 8). It is unclear what the significance of these eyes was for the ancient Mesopotamians, but it is possible they reminded an owner that the eyes of the gods were on them.
Among the most interesting are a pair carved from onyx and dedicated by the king Nabonidus to Ningal. Even though eye carvings have been found associated with many other deities, these are unique, and those which seem to resemble them are also thought to have been dedicated to Ningal. The eyes could have been protective talismans or, as noted, reminders that the eyes of the Great Lady and her divine husband were always upon the living. Many of these artifacts have been recovered from the ruins of Tell Brak (ancient Nagar) in modern-day Syria, not far to the



15
east of Harran, and were most likely amuletic objects honoring Ningal or talismans reminding one of the protection - and eventual judgment - by Nanna. At Harran, Nushku was regularly invoked in the execution (by fire) of those convicted of practicing the dark arts after Nanna and Ningal had presided over the defendant's trial.
It is not surprising to find Nanna in a position of judgment since he is included in early Sumerian god lists as among the first who decree the fates of humanity. The earliest group consisted of seven deities: Anu, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, Nanna/Sin, Utu/Shamash, and Inanna. All seven of these would change and grow and assume different roles and responsibilities throughout Mesopotamian history, but Nanna remains more or less the same from his inception. As with many Mesopotamian gods, Nanna was incorporated into the Assyrian pantheon and, when the Neo-Assyrian Empire fell in 612 BCE, a great number of these deities lost favor. Nanna continued to be recognized, however, and was still worshiped in the region of Syria as late as the 3rd century CE.[unquote] -- Joshua J. Mark published on 08 February 2017

12. In the second place he offers to Narāśaṃsa.
Now, Narāśaṃsa is the air. Man (nara), namely, means (human) being; and these same beings move about in the air speaking aloud. And when he (man) speaks, they say 'he chants (saṃs);' and therefore Narāśaṃsa is the air[7]. But the triṣṭubh also is the air[8], and for this reason they have placed the triṣṭubh second.
13. Then Agni is the last (to whom offering is made). Agni assuredly is the gāyatrī; and therefore they placed the gāyatrī last. In this way they established the metres in complete and proper order; and hence no confusion here takes place.
14. The Adhvaryu[9] says (to the Hotṛ), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer (yājyā) to the gods!' and the Hotṛ (begins his prayer) at all (the three offerings) with 'The divine . . . .' For the metres assuredly are the gods of the gods, since they are their cattle, and cattle means a home, and a home is a safe resting-place. The after-offerings, doubtless, are the metres: therefore the Adhvaryu says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods!' and at all of them the Hotṛ begins with 'The divine . . .[10].'
15. ['The divine Barhis (or Narāśaṃsa) may accept (the offering)] for abundant obtainment of abundant gift! [Vauṣaṭ!]' For a deity only the vaṣaṭ-call is pronounced, to a deity only offering is made; but here at the after-offerings there is no (proper) deity[11]. When he says 'The divine Barhis,' in this there is neither Agni, nor Indra, nor Soma; when he says 'The divine Narāśaṃsa,' neither is there in this anything whatever (of the nature of a god); and what Agni there is (in the third offering-prayer), he indeed is virtually the gāyatrī.
16. The reason, then, why he offers with the formula 'for abundant obtainment of abundant gift[12],' is that Agni is the obtainer of wealth, and Indra is the recipient of wealth; and Indra and



16
Agni are indeed the (joint) divinity of the metres: and in this way it is for a deity that the vaṣaṭ is pronounced, and to a deity that the offering is made.

And if (his Soma) were to meet with any miṣap when contained in the Nārāśaṃsa (cups), let him perform an oblation with, 'To the Nārāśaṃsa Fathers hail!' for the Nārāśaṃsa (man-praising) Fathers he then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.

Now what he offers in the fire, that he offers unto the gods, thereby the gods exist; and what (Soma) is consumed in the Sadas, that he offers unto men, thereby men exist; and in that the Nārāśaṃsa[16] cups of Soma) stand with the Soma-carts, thereby he offers unto the Fathers, thereby the Fathers exist.
Footnote 16 Nārāśaṃsa, 'pertaining to Narāśaṃsa (man's praise, i.e. Agni, or Soma, or the Fathers),' is the name given to certain remains of Soma-libations (or potations) sacred to the Fathers, which, in the nine Soma-cups, are temporarily deposited under the axle of the southern Soma-cart, till they are drunk by the priests at the end of the libation.

Soma in Vedic Mythology and Ritual (study) by Anjana Chakraborty | 2017 |
Summary: This thesis is called: A study of the evolution of Soma in vedic mythology and ritual. It represents a thorough discussion on the characteristics of Vedic Gods, Soma and Vedic rituals.
As the ritual plays a very important role in Rigveda it is only natural that Soma, the plant, the juice of which is so much used in the ritual is deified as one of the most important of Vedic God Soma. Soma, the Vedic God or Soma ritual is the making of synchronization of myth and ritual.

Soma represents a multifaceted state in the whole extent of the Vedic literature. Soma is the name of a plant from which Soma juice is extracted and offered to the Gods. As the ritual plays a very important role in Rigveda it is only natural that Soma, the plant, the juice of which is so much used in the ritual is deified as one of the most important of Vedic God Soma. Soma, the Vedic God or Soma ritual is the making of synchronization of myth and ritual. Soma has been compared to and equated with many Vedic deities. Indra was the most popular of the Vedic deities and was known to be the ultimate consumer of large amounts of Soma[1]. In the post Vedic mythology, Soma is identified with the Moon. Soma is the lord of all the plants. Soma is also called ‘Rajan’ and appears among the eight Vasus and the eight Lokapalas. Soma is a God of the flowing waters, a God of inspiration. There are a few myths that surround the origin of Soma as a God.
The word Soma comes from the root √su which means to extract or to make ready, prepare. These two meanings of the root give the two faces of Soma. On the side of esistence, extracting the finest quality of the foodstuffs in the process of metabolism and on the side of intelligence, preparing for all possible values of activity in the Soma is that thing which puts those two values together.
Soma played an extremely important role in Vedic rituals. Some of the most famous rituals are the Consecration of the King (Rajasuya), the drink of Power ritual (Vajapeya), varies Fire rituals (Agnishtoma). Soma juice is glorified as a drink of longevity. One of the important images of the Rigveda is Agni (the sacred fire) as the guide leading us to immortality (amrita) through the ritual of Soma. In the ritualistic process Soma ritual is one of the most important one which gradually assumed a cardinal and all important position in the Vedic religion.
Soma is described as a King and a Kshatriya. Soma’s rise to kingship also proves glorification of Soma cult. The Ninth Mandala of the Rigveda, it’s all the one hundred forty four hymns and six hymns from other books are dedicated to the God Soma. The entire Ninth Mandala of Rigveda is

in praise of Soma which is pressed by stones and flows through the woollen strainer into the wooden vats.
The exhilarating power of Soma led to its being regarded as a divine drink bestowing immortal life. Hence it is called amrita, draught of immortality. Soma is immortal and the Gods drank him for immortality[2]. He places his worshipper in the everlasting and imperishable world where there is eternal light and glory, and makes him immortal where king Vaivasvata lives[3]. Soma has medicinal power also. In the Ayurveda, Soma is ‘Osadhiraja’, the king of all the medicine.
Katyayana in Anukramanika states ‘Pavanam Saumvam’. Soma, the divinity had its Indo-Iranian counter representative. In Avesta Yasna IX: 17-20 Hoama is invoked where it is mentioned that an eagle brought Hoama from heaven to a high mountain. The God Soma heals the sick, making the blind to see and the lame to walk.
He is the guardian of men’s bodies and occupies their every limb, bestowing life in this world. The Soma draught is even said to dispel sin from the heart, to destroy falsehood and to promote truth. Soma had a very influential role developing and sustaining the Vedic tradition.
...
Soma is the soul of ritual, a priest among the Gods and apportions to them their share of ritual. Soma is a great fighter. He is a victor, unconquered in fight, born for battle. He is the most heroic of heroes. Soma is a fighter against darkness. He can also afford protection from foes. He drives away goblins and like some other Deities but more frequently, receives the epithet of goblin slayer. Soma is the only God who is called a slayer of the wicked. Being a warrior, Soma is said to have weapons. He is described as armed with a thousand pointed shafts and his bow is swift. The conception of Soma comes to be extended to that of a being of universal dominion, who is lord of the quarters, who performs the great cosmic actions of generating the two worlds, of creating or establishing heaven and earth, of supporting heaven and of placing light in the Sun.
As the Moon, Soma became equated with the God Candra, who originally was the Moon Deity. The Moon was considered the cup which held the drink Soma for the Gods, and one reason that the Moon waxed and waned, it was because the Gods were drinking down all the Soma; as it waxed, the God was recreating himself, only to be consumed again once the cup was again full. As the Vedic age ended and the Brahmans asserted themselves, the power of the Gods no longer came from Soma but instead from rituals made by humans; Soma came more and more to be just a God of the Moon. In later times, the waxing and waning of the
Moon was due to a curse put on Soma. Soma had twenty seven wives (who correspond to the twenty seven stations of the Moon). They were all the daughters of the Daksha. Daksha felt that Soma was paying too much attention to one of his daughters, thereby neglecting the rest. He cursed Soma to die a withering death. But Soma’s wives intervened, and so the death became
only periodic, during half of the month slowly dies away, but is reborn and comes around again to full vigour.

--The core of the Ur ziggurat is made of mud brick covered with baked bricks laid with bitumen, a naturally occurring tar. Each of the baked bricks measured about 11.5 x 11.5 x 2.75 inches and weighed as much as 33 pounds.
"What Woolley found was a massive rectangular pyramidal structure, oriented to true North, 210 by 150 feet, constructed with three levels of terraces, standing originally between 70 and 100 feet high. Three monumental staircases led up to a gate at the first terrace level. Next, a single staircase rose to a second terrace which supported a platform on which a temple and the final and highest terrace stood. The core of the ziggurat is made of mud brick covered with baked bricks laid with bitumen, a naturally occurring tar. Each of the baked bricks measured about 11.5 x 11.5 x 2.75 inches and weighed as much as 33 pounds. The lower portion of the ziggurat, which supported the first terrace, would have used some 720,000 baked bricks. The resources needed to build the Ziggurat at Ur are staggering.":

The Ziggurat of Ur...
[quote]The Great Ziggurat of Ur was a temple of Nanna, the moon deity in Sumerian mythology, and has two stages constructed from brick: in the lower stage the bricks are joined together with bitumen, in the upper stage they are joined with mortar. The temple was built in 2,100 B.C. during the reign of Ur-Nammu and stands 70 feet (21 m) high)....
In addition to excavating the ziggurat completely, the expedition unearthed the entire temple area at Ur and parts of the residential and commercial quarters of the city. The most spectacular discovery was that of the Royal Cemetery, dating from about 2600BC and containing art treasures of gold, silver, bronze, and precious stones. The findings left little doubt that the deaths of the king and queen of Ur were followed by the voluntary death of their courtiers and personal attendants and of the court soldiers and musicians. Within the city itself were discovered thousands of cuneiform tablets comprising administrative and literary documents dating from about 2700 to the 4th century BC. The deepest levels of the city contained traces of a flood, alleged to be the deluge of Sumerian, Babylonian, and Hebrew legend.[unquote]

Mohenjo-daro stupa & Great Bath - Modeled after Ziggurat and Sit Shamshi (Kalyanaraman, 2011) http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/11/mohenjo-daro-stupa-great-bath-modeled.html
Executive Summary: Artisans of Susa and artisans of Mohenjo-daro were worshippers of the ancestors, offering morning prayers with water ablutions. The stupa of Mohenjo-daro should have been built over a ziggurat (memorial for ancestors) used for such water ablutions in the Great Bath situated which is located in front of the ziggurat.

Shamash 'Sun' & Sit Shamshi 'bronze sunrise' derive from + , six passages of the Sun into zodiacal signs to signify six seasons https://tinyurl.com/yxzznprm
Sit Shamshi bronze model evokes the Ur ziggurat tiers. A significant pointer of the metaphor of the temple are four spheres on either side of the ziggurat. The prayer being offered at sun rise is to Shamash. Shamash is the son of the moon god Sin (known as Nanna or Naramsit in Sumerian), and thus the brother of the goddess Ishtar (Sumerian: Inanna). It is suggested that the expression Shamash in ANE as a reference to Sun Divinity is derived from + = Shamash
'Six months'. In this expression, is relatable to the Suryasiddhanta reference ड- - the passage of the sun into zodial signs to signify the six seasons.
