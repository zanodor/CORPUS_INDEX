PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
On October 30, 2000, I received an e-mail from William Hansen, a mythologist
in classical studies at Indiana University. At the time my husband, Deming, and
I were visiting research fellows in the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusi
cology at Indiana University in Bloomington. Professor Hansen told me that an
editor at ABC-CLIO was looking for someone to write a handbook on Chinese
mythology as part of its World Mythology series. He wondered if I could write
this volume. I was pleased to hear the news of this opportunity. I responded to
him swiftly: “Yes, I want to try.” In fact, I had long hoped that someday I could
introduce Chinese mythology to the West. I was encouraged to accept this great
challenge.
I have studied Chinese myths for more than ten years. My PhD dissertation
and my postdoctoral research focused on Nüwa myths. I have been conducting
fieldwork on myths and relevant folk religion in Henan, Hebei, Gansu, and
Shaanxi provinces since 1992, and I currently direct three research projects on
mythology. For these reasons, I am familiar with ancient Chinese myths
recorded in written accounts and living myths transmitted orally in China
today. Additionally, I have learned how most Chinese mythologists think of
myths and what they have accomplished in the field.
Since 1996 I have been teaching mythology to undergraduate and graduate
students at Beijing Normal University. In this setting I have discussed mythol
ogy with students and addressed their questions about Chinese myths. I also fre
quently discussed Chinese mythology with American scholars and students in
classroom and colloquium settings while a research fellow at Indiana Univer
sity. These experiences have given me an understanding of what nonspecialists
are interested in, and what might be the common misunderstandings of and bi
ases toward Chinese myths.
To my knowledge, there are no Chinese mythology books written in En
glish by Chinese mythologists. Although I am aware of several Chinese mythol
ogy texts that were originally written in Chinese and then translated into En
glish, these books are quite limited. Among them, perhaps the most notable is
Dragons and Dynasties: An Introduction to Chinese Mythology (Penguin
Books, 1993), which was written in the 1960s by Chinese mythologist Yuan Ke
(1916–2001). Because this book and others like it were written many years ago,
ix



they do not reflect new achievements in Chinese mythology, especially those
occurring in the past twenty years.
Western scholars have made great contributions to the field of Chinese
mythology from as early as the middle of the nineteenth century. Among nu
merous eminent books and papers, there are some that are exemplary, and thus
cited in this book. Derk Bodde’s article “Myths of Ancient China,” a short but
serious article, discusses many important issues pertaining to ancient Chinese
myth studies. Anne Birrell’s studies of Chinese mythology have been published
in several books and are cited within this volume. Her Chinese Mythology: An
Introduction is a valuable book that provides concise and insightful interpreta
tions and reliable accounts that are translated from primary sources in ancient
Chinese writings into English. Anthony Christie’s book, Chinese Mythology,
presents many primary classical Chinese myths and numerous beautiful illus
trations. Many of the illustrations are rarely seen in mainland China.
In spite of the important contributions that Western scholars have offered,
however, I have found problems with many of the English books on Chinese
mythology written by Western researchers. First, the Chinese myths discussed
in many of these books are usually limited to the ones recorded in ancient Chi
nese writings. They seldom, if at all, mention the myths that are spread orally
among Han people (the majority of the country’s population) and other ethnic
groups in contemporary China.
Second, these books usually view Chinese myths from Western values and
cultural tradition by nature of being written within Western scholarly circles.
For example, these scholars often compare Chinese myths with the classical
mythology of Greece and Rome, using the latter as the criterion for comparison
and analysis. They sometimes ignore how myths are transmitted and function
within Chinese society and culture. Additionally, these scholars often overlook
how native Chinese mythologists view myth and what has been accomplished
in current research and collection.
Third, their entries and sources are less selective, often including legends,
folktales, historical anecdotes, and mythical figures of classical novels. Frequently
the sources used in these books are an indiscriminate mix of different (and often
historicized) classical documents. Two popular books about Chinese myths, for
instance, Myths and Legends of China and A Dictionary of Chinese Mythology,
both written by the English sinologist E. T. C. Werner (1864–1954), found their
sources by mixing heterogeneous texts from ancient classics, mythical novels
written by novelists in sixteenth-century Buddhist sutras, and classical Taoist
texts. Unfortunately, though these two books have been sharply criticized by Chi
nese mythologists and other sinologists, they continue to be reprinted.
Fourth, an additional problem with many texts written by Westerners sim

ply has to do with the difficulty of translating Chinese myths into English.
Sometimes the original meanings of myths are misunderstood or are translated
too literally by Western scholars. For example, in one case, the water god Gong
gong’s name is translated simply and literally as “Common Work.” A similar lit
eral translation might be to interpret Confucius’s name (“Kongzi” in Chinese) as
“Hole Son,” which clearly does not make sense.
For these reasons, it is reasonable to believe that these books provide read
ers more or less with noncomprehensive, confusing, or even misleading knowl
edge about Chinese mythology.
This book is a contribution to the many books written by Western scholars
on Chinese mythology. It has some special characteristics among English-lan
guage books, which include:
1. Native mythologists’ standpoint. This book makes the most of Western
scholars’ achievements in Chinese mythology, but it also pays attention to
how Chinese people and Chinese mythologists perceive Chinese myths,
and what they have done, or are doing, in the field of Chinese myth study,
especially in the past twenty years. For example, this book introduces the
enormous national project San Tao Jicheng, or the Three Collections of
Folk Literature, which formally started in 1984 and is nearly completed.
This book, and current Chinese scholarship on mythology, greatly benefit
from this project. We also try to represent in this book the recent
interpretations some Chinese mythologists and historians make about
“the historicizing of Chinese myths.”
2. A more comprehensive picture of Chinese mythology. This book not only
presents the myths from ancient Chinese documents but also introduces
living myths that are orally transmitted in contemporary China.
Additionally, though this book focuses on the myths of Han Chinese
people, it also details many myths of various ethnic groups living in China
to illustrate the diversity of myths and people within China. The purpose
of this is to give readers an idea of the whole picture of Chinese
mythology, and to explain Han myths in a more interrelated background
of Chinese mythology and culture.
3. Emphasis on the relationship between Chinese myths and their social and
cultural contexts. This book not only illustrates myth as texts, it also pays
much attention to the relationship between Chinese myths and the social,
cultural, and historical contexts in which myths are created, transmitted,
and reshaped. Special consideration is paid to questions that have rarely
been discussed before: How are myths’ existence and transmission
influenced by their social and cultural contexts? How were myths thought
about, recorded, and changed in different periods of Chinese history? How
were myths used and reconstructed as an important cultural resource to
Preface and Acknowledgments xi



serve people’s current needs? And how have myths influenced Chinese
culture and society? Thus, this book does not take myths as isolated
ancient “dead” stories but tries to show their living forces and
interconnections with social and cultural contexts in many ways.
4. More selected entries and sources. This book exhibits myths that are often
discussed by Chinese scholars and known by Han Chinese people. The
types of entries include gods, goddesses, spirits, demigods, places of
importance in mythology (e.g., Kunlun Mountain), important mythical
animals and plants (e.g., Crow of the Sun; Fusang tree), mythological
accessories (e.g., Xirang, the self-growing soil; the elixir of immortality),
and mythical themes (e.g., the Flood). Entries refer to that which most
Chinese mythologists think of as “myths,” excluding legends and tales
about some mythical characters such as the Cowboy and Weaving Maiden
or the Horse-headed Lady; anecdotes about real historical heroes, and
figures of Taoism and Buddhism such as Laozi, Confucius, Guan Yu,
Guanyin, and the Eight Immortals; and the like. The sources of this book
mainly come from ancient written documents, archeological findings, the
national sources collected from the San Tao Jicheng project (some are not
published yet and only can be accessed by Chinese scholars), and also from
contemporary research including the authors’ field research and the
research of other Chinese mythologists.
When dynasties in ancient Chinese history are mentioned, their specific
time period in the text is not indicated except when necessary for understand
ing. In the middle of the Introduction is a chronology of Chinese history that de
tails different eras and dynasties in Chinese history. Additionally, to save space
and avoid unnecessary repetition, information about the author, the commenta
tor, the time an ancient Chinese text was written, and so on is usually provided
only at a particular writing’s first mention. Many of these texts are discussed in
the Introduction or are listed in the Glossary. Furthermore, all translations in
this book are mine or those of my contributors. Regarding sources we cite that
are written by Chinese scholars, we follow the traditional Chinese practice of
placing the person’s family name first, followed by the given name. For example,
my family name is Yang, and my given name is Lihui. In China this would ap
pear as Yang Lihui. This tradition is followed throughout the book, though our
names appear on the cover in the Western order.
To write this book I organized a team of authors. An Deming is an associate
professor of Chinese folklore who works at the Institute of Literature at the Chi
nese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. His research interest is Chinese folk
religion, which are closely connected to Chinese myths. He has conducted field
work on living myths in villages in northwest China. In this book, about one

fourth of the entries are written by him. Jessica Anderson Turner is a PhD candi
date of the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology of Indiana University.
She has visited China multiple times and continues to focus her research there.
As a 2003–2004 Fulbright Fellow she did field research in southern China. Her
current research focuses on revivals of tradition and music in China’s developing
tourism industry. In this book, her work has been to organize and edit our writing.
Writing this book has been a great challenge for Deming and me. Though
both of us have published several books, this is our first written in English. Chi
nese myths and the ancient classics are familiar to us, but it is hard to translate
them properly into a foreign language. Sometimes I spent half a day looking for a
suitable English word in various dictionaries! From time to time we had to aban
don complicated and delicate ideas and tried instead to express ourselves simply
but clearly.
We want to sincerely thank many people for helping us to finish this book.
William Hansen not only recommended us to become involved in this myth se
ries but also gave many helpful suggestions for the basic structure of this book
and the Introduction. Our colleagues and friends, Ma Changyi, Liu Xicheng, Song
Zhaolin, Lü Wei, Liu Zongdi, Bamo Qubumo, Chen Ganglong, Zhang Xia, and
many others, generously provided many supportive ideas or precious photographs
they took in their fieldwork. The editors at ABC-CLIO, Todd Hallman, Bob
Neville, Simon Mason, Vicky Speck, Peter Westwick, Carla Roberts, Michelle
Asakawa, Craig Hunt, and many others have helped us greatly with their inspir
ing suggestions, encouragement, and patience. Deming and I especially show
gratitude to Jessica. What she has done for this book goes far beyond what we
asked. She not only polished our English but also gave us many bright ideas and
useful tips to produce a better English book of Chinese mythology. We also thank
her husband, Steve Turner, who worked with an ancient black-and-white draw
ing of Nüwa and digitally added color, as it is brilliantly shown on the cover of
this book. We are also grateful to Lihui’s mother and Deming’s sister Mingzhu.
They helped us immensely by taking care of our daughter, which enabled us to
spend time to write this book.
Last but not least, we want to especially thank our daughter, An Xin, for her
love and understanding. An Xin came into this world just two months before we
began to write this book. She grows along with our writing. During the past two
years, she often patiently waited until we finished our writing for the day to play
with her. We feel extremely pleased that, at last, we have finished this book and
can now play with her lightheartedly!

INTRODUCTION
WHAT IS A MYTH?
When the word myth is used in everyday conversations, many people think of
those things or phenomena that are untrue, unimaginable, or mysterious. For
example, many people feel that tales of UFO sightings or personal accounts of
UFOs are contemporary myths. Others might say “there are many myths in
Hong Kong cinema. One of them is that audiences only like to see martial arts
films.” Some Chinese people believe that China is creating a myth, a marvelous
story, through its incredible progress in the development of a market-oriented
economy in today’s world. These popular uses of the word myth are quite differ
ent from the definitions of myth used by scholars who study mythology.
In mythology, there are also different definitions of myth. In fact, scholars
have been arguing about the definition for more than 2,000 years. Among the
most common arguments are the ones that myths are stories about gods or re
mote ancestors, myths are sacred stories, myths are stories that explain how the
world and humans came to be in their present forms, and myths encapsulate im
portant information about human thought, feeling, history, and social life.
In China, scholars also have conflicting ideas about the definition of myth.
For example, Yuan Ke (1916–2001), one of the most distinguished modern
mythologists, views the scope of myth in the broadest sense. According to Yuan,
fables such as “A Clam Fights with a Snipe” (wherein a clam that is basking in
the sunlight is pecked at by a snipe; the clam nips the snipe’s bill with its shells,
and they both refuse to give in, at which point a fisherman comes by and catches
them both), “Fox Borrows the Tiger’s Fierceness by Walking in the Latter’s Com
pany,” mysterious legends of historical emperors and officials, the legend of the
White Snake Lady (a white snake transforms into a beautiful lady and marries a
young man but is imprisoned under a magic tower by an officious monk), stories
of Guanyin (known as Avalokitesvara in Buddhism), and mythic novels like Jour
ney to the West (stories about a great, powerful monkey king named Sun

Wukong) all belong to myth.1 Though his argument is quite well-known, most
Chinese mythologists still concentrate their work on studying myth in a more
narrow sense. For instance, Lü Wei, one of the pioneering mythologists in con
temporary China, insists that myths are sacred stories that are told in the form of
narrative and employ symbols, such as images of gods, and try to understand the
cosmos through explaining the origins of the world, humans, and culture. Myths
provide sacred evidence to testify to the validity, rationality, and legitimacy of
cultural and social institutions.2 When examining these arguments about myth
while looking at the actual situations in which Chinese myths are transmitted,
two reminders might be necessary for understanding Chinese mythology.
The first reminder is that a myth is not necessarily sacred. Many scholars
believe that a myth is a sacred narrative, and it is often told in rituals.3 By con
trast, other scholars argue, “it can be misleading to focus on this quality as pri
mary,” stating that myths can also be told for entertainment and have no known
connections with solemn ritual.4 When investigating classical Chinese myths
recorded in ancient writings, one may find that it is often hard to discern
whether the myth tellers believe their myths to be true. Similarly, the attitude a

myth teller in contemporary China has toward his myths can be very compli
cated, too. In her fieldwork on Nüwa myths and beliefs from 1993 to 2003, in
the Henan, Hebei, and Gansu provinces of northern China, Yang Lihui found
that though many people came to Nüwa temples to worship Nüwa, when they
were asked whether they believed the myths about Nüwa, the answers were
quite varied. Most said “yes,” some directly said “no, that’s impossible,” and
others half-believed these stories to be true.5 They told these myths to express
their views and beliefs about gods and ancestors, or to boastfully display their
knowledge about remote history or local places, or just for fun. In those places
that have no relevant temples, myth tellers are more likely to tell myths for en
tertainment or traditional education (many people believe that myths can pro
vide knowledge about their past).
The second reminder about myths in China is that a myth is not necessar
ily told in the form of prose. It may also be chanted in the form of verse. Though
it is well-known that Homer’s epics, in verse form, are a treasure of Greek
mythology, in many cultures myths are usually told in prose. Myth is thus often
mentioned by scholars as one of the three major genres of “prose narratives,”
along with legends and folktales.6 However, in China, some myths are told in
the form of an epic or sung as a song. Among Han people in Sichuan, Hubei,
Henan, and Shaanxi provinces, for example, a myth may be sung in a brief or a
long narrative folk song. It may be sung in wedding ceremonies, funeral rituals,
shamans’ theurgist rites, or during the occasions of a temple fair. Sometimes
several myths are combined together into a long narrative folk song. It may be
sung continually in rituals for days. In some other ethnic groups of China, espe
cially groups in the south such as Miao, Yao, Yi, Naxi, Bai, Zhuang, Achang, and
Lahu, creation epics are common. Since they tell myths, they are sometimes
called “mythic epics” by Chinese folklorists. A famed Miao creation epic, “An
cient Songs of the Miao People” (Miaozu Guge), found in the southeast of
Guizhou Province and usually antiphonally sung by two or more singers (one
asks questions, and the other answers) on traditional festival occasions and in
special ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, describes in detail the
processes of the creation of the sky and the earth, of making and fixing the huge
pillars between sky and earth, the creation of the sun and the moon and the
plants and animals, the marriage of the brother-sister human ancestors and their
repropagation of humans in this world, and the process of the Miao people’s
moving around for a better life, finally finding the place where they live today.7
The myths narrated in this epic are also orally transmitted in prose. Similar sit
uations (a myth can be narrated both in prose and verse) can be found in many
other ethnic groups.8 Therefore, there is no absolute distinction between a myth
told in prose form and one in verse.
Introduction 3



For ordinary readers, the “minimum definition” of myth offered by Stith
Thompson in 1955 may be useful. “Myth,” he writes, “has to do with the gods
and their actions, with creation, and with the general nature of the universe and
of the earth.”9
A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO CHINESE MYTHOLOGY
By Chinese mythology, we mean the body of myths historically recorded and
currently transmitted within the present geographic boundaries of China. It
should include not only myths transmitted by people of the Han ethnic group
but also those by the other fifty-five ethnic groups living in this broad area.
Since almost every ethnic group has its own mythical gods and stories about
their creative actions, there is not a systematic, integrated, and homogeneous
“Chinese mythology” held and transmitted by all the Chinese people. Even
among Han people, there is not an integrated system of myths.
Since it is impossible to include in this single volume all the myths trans
mitted in a total of fifty-six ethnic groups of China, this book will basically in
troduce those well-known myths that are recorded in ancient writings in the
Chinese language and orally transmitted by the Han people (whose predecessor
is historically called the “Huaxia Ethnic Group”), which now make up nearly 92
percent of the country’s population. Some of these myths have been recorded in
ancient writings, and some are still orally transmitted in contemporary China.
At the same time, this book will also introduce some relevant myths or mythic
motifs of other ethnic groups. In doing so, we aim to give readers a general idea
of the whole picture of Chinese mythology with the hope that readers will un
derstand Chinese myths in the broader context of Chinese culture.
Main Sources for the Myths of Ancient China
The earliest written records of ancient myths can be traced back to about 3,000
years ago, though other forms of designs and paintings on shells, bones, and
bronzes probably relating to myth appeared earlier than this. Recently, re
searchers found a bronze vessel named “Suigongxu” (Suigong was a duke of the
Sui State, now belonging to modern Shandong Province; “Xu” is an ancient
bronze vessel that has a cover and two ears; it functions as a food container),
which was dated to the ninth or eighth century BC, the middle of the Western

Zhou dynasty. The inscription on the inside bottom of the vessel consists of 98
Chinese characters, praising the achievements of the mythic hero Yu. It tells the
story that heaven ordered Yu to scatter earth, so Yu went around all the moun
tains, cutting down the trees in the forests and deepening the seas and rivers to
drain all the water on earth into the sea.10 This inscription shows that the tech
nique of recording myth in Chinese characters had become relatively mature
nearly 3,000 years ago. Additionally, it illustrates that at least as late as the mid
dle of the Western Zhou dynasty, the myth about Yu controlling the flood had
already been spread, and it had been historicized into a legend about a great hero
or a great king in the upper class of society.
But these inscriptions recorded myths very simply. Sometimes the mytho
logical stories they illustrate are hard to understand. Therefore, Chinese schol
ars rely primarily on accounts of myths recorded in later ancient writings after
the Western Zhou dynasty to study these myths.
Introduction 5
Map of China. (Digital Wisdom)



In China, there is no sacred canon recording myths, beliefs, or sacred history
like the Bible or the Koran, nor were there any literati, troubadours, or shamans
(sorcerer or sorceress) who collected myths from oral tradition and compiled
them into a systematic and integrated mythology, like the Greek collections at
tributed to Homer and Hesiod. Rather, myths in ancient China were usually
spread in scattered and fragmented forms in various written material. These
sources contain information about archaeology, literature, philosophy, geogra
phy, history, witchcraft, ethnography, religion, folklore, and so on. Many of them
preserve only a few myths, but some of them hold a comparatively large number
of myths and thus become treasures of ancient Chinese myths. Among them,
Shanhaijing (The Classic of Mountains and Seas), Chuci (The Songs of Chu), and
Huainanzi are thought to be the major repositories of Chinese ancient myth.
Shanhaijing
Shanhaijing is an important book in ancient Chinese mythology studies. It is
even noted by some as an encyclopedia of ancient China. It describes various
mountains and seas, products of the mountains such as plants or medicines,
myths, witchcraft, and religion of ancient China. It also records the geography,

history, medicine, customs, and ethnicities in ancient times. The book contains
eighteen chapters and can be divided into two main parts: the Classic of Moun
tains, and the Classic of Seas. The Classic of Mountains has five chapters, and
the Classic of Seas has the remaining thirteen.
There is no widely accepted conclusion as to who wrote Shanhaijing and
when it was written.11 But most scholars believe that Shanhaijing was written
by many different authors in different times. As for dating Shanhaijing, most
think this book was written in the period from the middle of the Warring States
era to the beginning of the Western Han era (ca. fourth century BC to the early
second century BC).12
The focus of Shanhaijing is also quite controversial. Some scholars think
that it is a geographic book, because there are abundant descriptions of various
mountains, seas, rivers, roads, mines, and local products. Other scholars argue
that Shanhaijing is a book about witchcraft, noting numerous descriptions in the
text about gods and shamans’ activities, such as how they went up and down sky
ladders and communicated between gods and humans, how they produced winds
and rains, and how they rescued dead gods with the elixir of immortality. This
book also describes many sacrificial products and rituals, and even many
shamans’ names. Some scholars think Shanhaijing illustrates how primitive
Chinese people in the Central Plain imagined the outside world.13 Some argue
that Shanhaijing, especially the chapters of regions beyond the seas and chapters
of the great wildness, is in fact a description and interpretation of the ancient cal
endar system and calendric rites.14
Shanhaijing is commonly referred to as one of the treasures of Chinese
mythology. Many well-known myths can be found in this book in their early ver
sions, such as myths of Nüwa, Xiwangmu (the Queen Mother of the West), Gun
and Yu, Jingwei, Huang Di and Chiyou, and also myths about the sky ladders, the
pillars holding up the sky, the three-legged crow carrying the suns, and many oth
ers. Most of the time the plots of these myths were recorded only skeletally and
fragmentally. For example, chapter 16 describes, “There are ten gods who named
Nüwa’s gut. Nüwa’s gut turned into spirits. They took different routes and set
tled into the wilderness Liguan.” There is no further explanation about Nüwa,
the gut spirits, and the mythological event.
But sometimes Shanhaijing contains whole stories, written in the concise
and condensed style that is common in most ancient Chinese records. For in
stance, in chapter 17, a text describes the battle between Huang Di, or the Yel
low Emperor, and Chiyou:
Here is Xikun Mountain, where the Gonggong Terrace is located. Archers do not
dare to face it in the north. Here there is a goddess dressed in green. Her name is
Introduction 7



the Huang Di’s Daughter Ba. Chiyou made weapons and attacked Huang Di.
Thus, Huang Di commanded Yinglong (Responding Dragon) to launch an attack
against him in the wilderness of the Central Plain. Yinglong began by storing all
the water. Chiyou asked Feng Bo (the Wind God) and Yu Shi (the Rain Master) to
release a cloudburst. Then Huang Di asked the goddess Ba to descend down from
the heavens and the rain was stopped. This eventually killed Chiyou.
The story recorded in this text is quite concise but complete. Besides this
myth, myths about the divine bird Jingwei filling up the sea, the hero Kuafu pur
suing the sun, and the cultural heroes15 Gun and Yu controlling the flood are
also found in complete forms. For this reason, it is difficult to agree with the ar
gument that the narratives in Chinese myths are weak and that there are only a
few Chinese myths narrating full stories.16
Chuci
Chuci is an ancient poem collection from the end of the Warring States era and
the early Western Han era. It was written mainly by Qu Yuan (ca. 340–278 BC),
who was the earliest celebrated poet in ancient China, as well as several other
poets. Chuci literally means “the Songs of Chu.” Originally it was widely used
to refer to the songs popular in the Chu area (now Hubei and Hunan provinces in
southern China) and sung by the Chu people. Because of this collection, which
was compiled by the Han scholar Liu Xiang, Chuci became a title for a specific
new poem style in the Warring States era represented by Qu Yuan. Its style is
characterized by strong local flavor. It used the Chu dialect, was sung in Chu
rhythm, and recorded many Chu places and local products. Besides these, differ
ing from the folk songs of the Central Plain at that time whose style followed an
orderly four-character poem, the sentences in a song of Chu were of different
lengths. A more obvious characteristic of the Chu song is that in the middle of
every sentence (and sometimes at the end), a syllable is always used as the mood
indicator pronounced as “Xi.” Apart from the folk songs of Chu, Chuci was also
deeply influenced by Chu customs. Chu people believed in witchcraft and liked
to offer sacrifices to gods and ghosts. When they offered sacrifices they often
composed music and songs to amuse the gods. Qu Yuan was born in the Chu
area and deeply influenced by Chu culture. He not only wrote poems by learning
from folk sacrificial songs but also adopted a lot of Chu myths and legends to
compose his poems. Among his poems, “Tianwen” (“Questions of Heaven”)
contains the most myths.
“Tianwen” was said to have been written by Qu Yuan after he was unjustly
exiled from the royal palace of Chu. When he saw paintings of gods and ances

tors on the walls of the ancestral temple of Chu, he wrote this poem on the wall
to express his anger and doubt about reality and the universe. The poem asks
172 questions related to popularly spread myths, legends, and pieces of history.
Among them are many myths, including myths about Gun and Yu restraining
the great flood, Yi shooting down the surplus suns, Gonggong destroying the
mountain that supported the heavens, Kunlun Mountain, Zhulong (literally
meaning “Torch Dragon”), the eight poles supporting the sky, and the toad on
the moon. “Tianwen” sometimes provides rich details about some ancient
myths, such as the Gun myth:
Introduction 9
Qu Yuan (Poems of Chu Yuan, 1638)



When the sparrow hawk and turtle joined together (and offered strategies),
Why did Gun accept their suggestions?
He obeyed everyone’s plea to stop the flood,
Why did the Supreme Divinity kill him?
His corpse was abandoned at Yushan,
Why did it not rot for three years?
...
He was blocked at Yushan and was not allowed to go west,
How did he surmount those lofty and precipitous peaks?
He metamorphosed into a yellow bear after his death,
Why did those shamans revive him?
...
This text contains many details of the Gun myth; some of them cannot be
found in other writings. For instance, it states that when Gun began to try to
control the flood, there appeared the sparrow hawk and turtle and they joined to
gether. Scholars infer that when Gun tried to control the flood, he might have
adopted suggestions and strategies of the sparrow hawk and turtle.17 Other plots
of the Gun myth recorded in this poem also are unique, such as Gun being de
tained at Yushan, or Yu Mountain, after his death and not allowed to go west.
Taking on the image of a yellow bear, he managed to surmount those steep
peaks to find shamans to help him come back to life.
However, since this poem was written in the form of questions, stories in
the poem usually appear in fragments. Therefore, it is almost impossible to un
derstand a full myth from it. Sometimes the questions were written in such a
vague and succinct way that it is difficult really to understand what questions
Qu Yuan was actually asking.18 This shortcoming limits the role that “Tian
wen” plays in Chinese myth studies.
Huainanzi
Huainanzi (ca. 139 BC) is a book written and compiled at the beginning of the
Western Han dynasty by Liu An, the king of Huainan, and many of his aides. Liu
An is said to have enjoyed reading books and playing music. He wanted to ac
complish something beneficial to others and become a legacy. So he gathered
thousands of literary scholars and alchemists to write Huainanzi, which is at
tributed to the Eclectics, a school of thought that combined various philoso
phies and flourished during the pre-Qin period.
Huainanzi preserves many ancient myths, legends, and historical accounts.
The myths that it contains include the following: Nüwa repairs the broken sky;
Yi shoots down the extra nine suns; Chang’e steals the elixir of immortality and
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
10



flees to the moon; Yu controls the
flood; Gongong butts into Mount
Buzhou and destroys the sky pillar
and the cords holding up the earth.
Some of these myths are recorded
only in Huainanzi, and some provide
important contrasts to other ancient
writings. Therefore, many of its
records are often cited in studies of
Chinese myths. Generally speaking,
myths in Huainanzi are usually
complete. Compared to myths
recorded in Shanhaijing and “Tian
wen,” which are usually recorded
fragmentally, myths in Huainanzi
are often written in a more complete
form, with detailed story plots. For
example, the myth of the goddess
Nüwa in Huainanzi states that
in remote antiquity, the four poles
supporting the sky collapsed, and
the land of the nine divisions of an
cient China broke up. The sky could
not completely cover the earth, and
the earth could not totally carry the
world. Fires raged fiercely and did
not go out. Floodwater ran every
where and did not subside. The
fierce beasts devoured kind people,
and violent birds seized the old and
the weak. Nüwa then melted stones of five different colors to patch the sky, cut
the legs off of a huge tortoise and set them up to support the four extremities of
the sky, slaughtered the Black Dragon to save the people, and collected ashes of
reeds to stop the flood. After that the sky got renewed, the four sky pillars were
set up again, the flood was stopped, and the nine divisions became peaceful.
This text narrates a complete event: the setting, the reasons of the goddess
Nüwa’s actions, the process of the solution, and the result. It presents a precious
record of an ancient Nüwa myth and thus is often cited by researchers.

Three Features of the Written Records
When we examine the written records of ancient myths in the Chinese lan
guage, three features seem to be obvious and often are argued by scholars: that
the myths are scattered and fragmented, that they are historicized, and that they
have been rewritten as literature and philosophy.
Scattered and Fragmented. Myths in ancient China are preserved in various
written accounts, usually in a fragmented form. They were not collected and
organized into a single, systematic mythology of China. This phenomenon is
usually taken as evidence of the scarcity and undevelopment of Chinese myths.
Some scholars explain that this is because Chinese people pay more attention to
real life than to the supernatural world. When criticizing the false impression
that China has a deficiency of myths, Yuan Ke pointed out three major reasons
that caused this characteristic. The first reason comes from the lack of gifted
poets like Homer and Hesiod to collect various ancient Chinese myths from oral
tradition and retell them in an eloquent style. The second reason is that in an
cient times, Chinese writings were usually in “unwieldy and ideographic
forms,” not yet sophisticated enough to express the complexities of Chinese
myths. And the third reason is the negative attitude of ancient Chinese scholars
(especially the Confucians) toward the miraculous and marvelous elements in
myths.19 In contrast to the common idea that this characteristic is a disadvan
tage for the records of Chinese myths, Yuan Ke thinks it has some advantages.
Chinese myths have not suffered what Yuan Ke describes as a complete rework
ing by literati and others, like Homer’s and Hesiod’s work, and thus remain in a
more or less “pristine condition.” Additionally, they are “more reliable docu
mentary evidence of a primitive and archaic oral tradition in the world of
myth.”20
Historicized. That early myth records were historicized has been recog
nized by many scholars. Zhong Jingwen and Yang Lihui have examined the his
tory of myth study in ancient China, pointing out that the historicizing, or ra
tionalizing, of myths is prevalent during the 2,000 years of mythology research
before the fall of the Qing dynasty. If a scholar found something strange or in
credible in the ancient texts, these findings would be removed or rationalized.
An anecdote about Confucius (named Kong Qiu in Chinese, but is popularly re
spected as Kongzi or Kongfuzi, 551 BC–479 BC) states that when he was asked
whether Huang Di was really four-faced as it was popularly said (“face” is pro
nounced mian in Chinese), he replied that in fact this meant that Huang Di sent
four officials in four directions to administrate (mian also means “direction”).
Another example comes from Luo Mi, a scholar in the Southern Song dynasty.
When he wrote a book of history, he interpreted the myth of Nüwa repairing the
broken sky as a historical event in which the ancient empress Nüwa put down a
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
12



rebellion made by one of her
dukes. After this rationalization,
ancient scholars would then in
terpret these myths to be ac
counts of the history of China.21
However, recently some Chi
nese scholars have put forward
different ideas. They think that
the historicizing of ancient Chi
nese myths is a presumption or
hypothesis made by Chinese
scholars themselves. When Chi
nese scholars began to build a
modern discipline of Chinese
mythology at the beginning of the
twentieth century, they were
deeply influenced by Western
scholarship and wanted to look
for the subject of mythology in
historical documents. Thus, there
are arguments that these scholars
changed history into myths. In
the view of some scholars today,
there is no such thing as the his
toricizing of myths. Instead, there
was the mythologizing of history.22
Rewritten as Literature and Philosophy. Examples of myth being rewritten as
literature and philosophy can be found in Taoist writings, especially in the book
Zhuangzi. When the famous Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi (or Zhuang Zhou, ca.
369–286 BC; “Zi” is an ancient respectful address for a learned man) adopted an
cient myths into his writings, he decorated them with many descriptions and
filled them with his Taoist ideas. An example of this is the Hundun myth. Hun
dun is a god who has no openings on his body whatsoever. The gods Shu and Hu,
hoping to pay a debt of gratitude to Hundun, tried to chisel openings into Hun
dun’s body. They chiseled one hole each day. After seven days of their work, Hun
dun died. Like many other myths or legends appearing in Zhuangzi, the Hundun
story has clearly been reshaped by Zhuangzi to illustrate his Taoist philosophy.
The two meddling gods Shu and Hu are used to symbolize the artificial order
(time and direction), while Hundun symbolizes the primeval chaos, which is a
natural, unspecified, unified whole. In the story the artificial order destroyed the
Introduction 13
Confucius (Bettman/Corbis)



natural and harmonic whole. In this example, Zhuangzi used a very simple story
to express his idea that one should respect nature and should not insist on doing
something that is not natural. He stressed that politicians should let events take
their own course, and they should not intervene in this natural order without un
derstanding it completely.
Myths Orally Transmitted among Contemporary Han People
Textual analysis of ancient written recordings has long been the traditional
method of Chinese mythologists. Though this method of literary text research is
necessary and beneficial to Chinese mythology, it can be abused and cause mis
leading conclusions about Chinese mythology.23 Today more and more Chinese
mythologists consciously use a synthesis of methods by combining ancient
written texts with material from archeological findings and oral tradition.
Concern for myths collected from oral tradition can be traced back to the
early decades of the twentieth century.24 The first large-scale collection of living
myths in China occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.25 But as noted previously,
the largest collection of living myths from oral tradition in modern China is the
national project San Tao Jicheng, or the Three Collections of Folk Literature.
The San Tao Jicheng Project
Formally begun in 1984 and near completion, San Tao Jicheng aims to be a gen
eral investigation of Chinese oral tradition. Managed by the Ministry of Culture,
the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, and the China Federation of Literary and
Art Circles, the project was carried out by the Society for the Study of Folk Lit
erature and Art, which is now called the Chinese Folk Literature and Art Soci
ety. The project does not aim to collect only myths, though. Rather, it consists
of three collections: stories (including myths, legends, fairy tales, jokes, and
other prose narrative forms), folk songs and rhymes, and proverbs. The partici
pants of this project first collected these stories, folk songs, and proverbs in vil
lages, then chose part of the material and compiled it into a county collection.
These county collections were then compiled into volumes for each province.
As of 1990, over 4 million proverbs, 3 million folk songs and rhymes, and nearly
2 million stories had been collected. More than 2 million people were involved
in this collection project.26
In the process of conducting this research, many orally transmitted myths
have been collected and published. These myths were mainly gathered from the
Han people, but some also spread in the vast areas inhabited by other ethnic

14



groups living in China. For example, as a result of the project, in Huzhou Dis
trict, Zhejiang Province, more than twenty myths, all from Han people, were se
lected for the district’s volume of stories.27 In Sichuan Province, a book titled Se
lected Myths from Sichuan Province was published in 1992. This book contains
more than 120 living myths and various versions that are spread among ten eth
nic groups in contemporary Sichuan Province. Among them, over ninety myths
and versions are collected from the Han, and others are gathered from Tibetan,
Yi, Lisu, Qiang, Tujia, Miao, Hui, Naxi, and Mongol peoples.28

Some Chinese mythologists pay much attention to these living myths col
lected from oral tradition, especially from San Tao Jicheng, to study Chinese
myths. For example, Zhong Jingwen studied the brother-sister marriage myth
using material collected for San Tao Jicheng.29 Zhang Zhenli, using data that he
and his research team collected from Han people in the Central Plain area30 as
well as myths from this area collected in San Tao Jicheng, compared these re
cently collected myths with ancient ones. He conducted this research to dis
cover relationships between classical myths and modern ones in order to under
stand how classical myths in this area changed over time, and how they exist in
contemporary Henan Province.31 Yang Lihui used more than 500 myths about
Nüwa and the brother-sister marriage, mainly from the San Tao Jicheng project
and from her own fieldwork in Han communities in modern Hebei, Henan, and
Gansu provinces, in her book, The Cult of Nüwa: Myths and Beliefs in China.
Stressing a more synthetic approach and the significance of context, she not
only discusses the transformation of Nüwa myths during the past 2,000 years
but also examines the social and cultural contexts in which myths are told
today. She further looks into the functions of Nüwa myths and beliefs and the
reasons why they are of great vitality today. Yang indicates several characteris
tics of the transformation of myths in modern Chinese society, comparing them
to their ancient versions. These characteristics mainly include adhesion and the
combination of various myth types and motifs, localization, secularization, and
the influence of religion.32 These forms of transformation can be found in many
myths that are told orally in contemporary China.
A Myth-telling Performance in Renzu Temple
In 1993, mythologist Yang Lihui did a field study in Huaiyang County, Henan
Province, to investigate how myths continue to be told in situational contexts33
in contemporary Han communities, how classical myths are transformed and in
what ways, and how and why people reconstruct them in their social and cul
tural lives.34 Huaiyang County is located in the eastern part of Henan Province,
32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Zhoukou City. It has an area of 1,469
square kilometers (588 square miles) and a population of 1.24 million. Under its
administration are six towns and fourteen villages.35 Huaiyang is said to be the
legendary capital of the god Fuxi’s mythic kingdom. In the northern part of the
county is the Renzu Temple complex (Temple of the Ancestors of Humans). Ac
cording to a 1936 report, many temples were intact at the Renzu complex at that
time, including several to Fuxi and one to Nüwa. During the Cultural Revolu
tion (1966–1976), many of the temples—including Nüwa’s—were destroyed be
cause they were thought to be “feudal superstitions.” Yet in 1993, the local gov
ernment was planning to reconstruct the Nüwa temple because the government
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
16



now believes that the worship of human ancestors (Fuxi and Nüwa) can be a cul
tural resource and can attract tourists and donations. This has encouraged folk
beliefs and caused a folk-culture revival.
During the lunar cycle from February 2 to March 3, a festival now is held at
the Renzu Temple complex to celebrate Fuxi’s birthday. The festival draws tens
of thousands of pilgrims daily from nearby villages, counties, and provinces.
They come to Renzu for many different purposes: to make supplications to the
ancestors; to thank the ancestors for fulfilling their supplications; and to pray for
children, happiness, health, wealth, going to college, and many other things.
Most of the pilgrims are women. Many of them travel here together in pilgrim
associations usually led by women. Some stay for the full month of the celebra
tion.
It is a genuine festival of local community. Outside the temples, business
stalls extend for miles, selling local snacks, local handicrafts (such as “mud dogs”
and cloth tigers), farm tools, and spiritual statues (Fuxi and Nüwa, Buddha, and
even Chairman Mao Zedong). In the temples, there are more lively and exciting
scenes. Besides the many vendors’ stalls, the area is full of pilgrims: they may
dance danjingtiao (a folk dance meaning “Carrying Pole Dance”), sing songs
praising the ancestors, tell fortunes, and play local operas to please the ancestors.
Among them, some women will bring shoes to Nüwa that they embroidered.
They sacrifice the shoes to Nüwa by displaying them in the Renzu Temple com
plex or burning them with incense, paper money, or paper buildings (intended as
ancestors’ dwellings). By doing these things, they believe the ancestors will re
ceive their tributes and be pleased, and thus will grant them what they hope for.
There are many customs specific to the Renzu Festival. Two that relate to
Nüwa’s myths and beliefs are ninigou and jingge. Ninigou (“mud dog”) is a gen
eral name for toys made of mud. These toys are usually monkeys, swallows, tur
tles, tigers, or a combination of monkeys riding a tiger or a horse. The craftsmen
who make the mud dogs explain their origin with a myth that the ancestors cre
ated humans by mud. The ancestors’ children want to imitate their mythical ac
tivity and thus to remember them. These kinds of festival crafts illustrate how
myths exist in local communities, even as toys, therefore making their place in
nearly every level of society from ritual to play.
Jingge is a type of folk song that usually is sung to express people’s folk be
liefs, but sometimes people use the melodies to make fun and sing about their
ordinary life. During the Renzu Festival, many pilgrims (especially women) will
sing jingge to commemorate and praise the ancestors, simultaneously believing
they can obtain the ancestors’ blessings by doing so. As for the content, many
jingge not only tell the myths of the ancestors but also often end with moral ed
ucation or propagation—for example, this jingge song:
Introduction 17



Remember the beginning of the world is chaos,
Without sky, without earth, without human beings.
Then the deity of sky created the sun, the moon, and the stars,
Then the deity of earth created the grain and grass.
Having the sky and earth, the chaos separated,
Thus appeared Renzu, the brother and sister.
They climbed to the high mountain Kunlun,
To throw the millstone and get married.
They gave birth to hundreds of children,
That’s the origin of Baijiaxing (human beings).
Therefore, though people in this world look different,
In fact they belong to the same family.
How wrong it is to struggle for wealth and fame,
Because you can’t bring them with you when you go into the grave.
I urge you to be a good person,
Because a good person can be blessed by the Renzu in earth.
A widespread myth at this festival is that of the brother-sister marriage.
When Yang and her colleagues met a fifty-year-old woman (an illiterate peasant)
who was selling local snacks in the Renzu Temple complex, they asked her if
she knew something about the source of the Renzu Temple. She related a legend
of why the Renzu Temple was reconstructed during the Ming dynasty. After
that, when she was asked why people worshiped the ancestors, she told the
brother-sister marriage myth: Once upon a time, there were a brother and his
sister. Every day, when they went to school, they fed a stone turtle. One day
when they fed the turtle, the turtle told them there would be a great flood. Only
the two of them survived the deluge by hiding in the belly of the turtle. They
wanted to marry each other in order to re-create human beings. Wondering
whether this was proper, they decided to divine by throwing the two pieces of a
millstone from two different mountains. The two pieces landed on top of one
another, so they got married.
While this myth was being told to Yang, several others surrounded them,
listening while the woman spoke. Upon hearing that the ancestors married, an
older woman suddenly interrupted, “How can a brother marry his sister?! The
two pieces of the millstone did not fall on top of each other, so they did not get
married. That’s why today brothers and sisters can’t marry each other.” The
younger myth teller looked embarrassed and hesitated to continue. With en
couragement from Yang and her colleagues, she concluded the story quickly and
roughly: after the marriage, the brother and sister decided to create humans by
molding mud. They placed the mud-humans outside to let them dry. But there

18



came a rain. So they hurried to sweep the mud-humans back into their cave.
During the process, some people lost their arms, some lost their legs, and some
were blinded. That is why today there are some disabled people in this world.
Later Yang and her group caught up with the older lady and asked her to tell
what she knew of the brother-sister myth. She told the same tale but in a more
detailed and vivid narrative style: the brother and sister threw the two pieces of
millstone from different mountains, and the two pieces separated. Therefore,
the brother and sister did not get married. Then, they decided to create humans
by molding mud. And when the rain came, some were disabled.
Afterward, she ended: “You literate people know human beings originated
from monkeys. Why? Because when humans were created by the ancestors, they
actually looked like monkeys, because they had fur on their skin. But they grad
ually changed, gradually changed, and then became human. Their children be
came more and more handsome and beautiful.”
This is a myth-telling event, a moment of transmission and transformation
of the myth. Many factors are interplaying in this dynamic process, including
Introduction 19

ethics, evolutionism, and belief. They interweave and shape the conduct of the
myth-telling performance. This event also shows how a myth is recontextual
ized and transformed by a creative person. The older lady illustrated her creativ
ity by changing the myth to solve problems of incest and evolutionism that
exist in the brother-sister marriage myth. Therefore, she made it more reason
able to the modern moral system and scientific notion. While displaying to the
folklorists and others her creative competence of myth telling and her authority
in traditional knowledge, she also expressed her views and beliefs about ances
tors, ethics, science, and human history.
Myths in Other Ethnic Groups
The Richness of Myth in China’s Ethnic Minorities
Many Western readers think China is a single-ethnic country and that Chinese
mythology is equally unified, integrated, and homogenous. In addition, because
the Han people make up the majority of the population in China, when some
Western scholars introduce Chinese myths they usually discuss only the myths
of the Han people. But in fact, China has 56 ethnic groups including the Han.
Since China boasts many ethnic groups, and almost every ethnic group has its
own body of myths, myths spread in the modern geographic boundaries of China
are rich not only in amount but also in types, themes, and motifs. For example,
there are more than ten myth types explaining the origins of humans:
1. Humans were made by gods. Among this type, there are many subtypes,
such as: (1) Gods created humans from mud. This subtype can be found in
Han, Kazak, and many other ethnic groups. (2) Humans were made from
carvings on wood. This type of myth can be found in Manchu, Lahu, and
others. (3) Humans were made by combining many plants together. A myth
told among the Tujia people states that the goddess Yiluo created humans,
using bamboo as their bones, lotus leaf as the liver, cowpea as their gut,
radish as their flesh, and a gourd as their head. Then she poked seven
apertures into the head (two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and one mouth)
and blew air into them, and after that the human was alive. (4) Gods
created humans by cutting a rein into pieces and then scattering them
everywhere; these pieces transformed into human beings. This type of
myth can be found in the Baima Tibetan ethnic group in Sichuan Province.
2. Humans were sown from seeds. A myth told by the Zou people in Taiwan
states that a god sowed the seed of humans into the earth, and later
humans grew.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
20



3. Humans were spat out from the mouths of gods and goddesses. Among
the Uighur people, it is popularly said that a goddess inhaled the dust and
air of the universe and then spat out the sun, the moon, the earth, stars,
and humans.
4. Humans were made from sound. A myth spread among the Miao people
in Yunnan Province that after a huge flood, only a mother and her son
were left. A god turned the mother into a girl to marry the son. When the
son realized that the girl he married was none other than his mother, he
ran into the wilderness and shouted. His mother followed him and also
shouted. Where their voices sounded, there emerged humans.
5. Humans came from the shadows of deities. Humans were made by a god
and a goddess projecting their shadows onto the earth. This type of myth
can be found among the Miao people and other groups.
6. Humans were created by two gods touching their knees together. This
myth, told by Yamei people in Taiwan, states that the first human couple
was created this way.
7. Humans were transformed from animals. Among the Yao people in
Guangxi Province, a popular myth explains that the great goddess
Miluotuo carried a beehive home and refined the bees several times a day.
After nine months, the bees were transformed into humans.
8. Humans were transformed from plants. A creation myth of the De’ang
ethnic people in Yunnan Province describes that 102 tea leaves went
around and around in the air for 30,000 years and then metamorphosed
into fifty-one young men and fifty-one girls.
Besides these types of myths, there are many other types, themes, and mo
tifs concerning the origin of humans in various ethnic groups, such as a human
emerging from a cave, coming out from a huge stone or a gourd, being procreated
by animals or plants, being born after a man married a goddess or an animal,
being procreated by the sun, or being made from a corpse of a divine creature.36
Flood Myths
Most types and themes of Chinese myths are not confined to only one or two
ethnic groups but are common to several ethnic groups. Flood myths have been
documented among forty-three ethnic groups in China. These myths have dif
ferent formal characteristics in different ethnic groups. Based on his study of
over 400 versions of flood myths, Chen Jianxian, a modern Chinese mythologist,
divided the flood myths in China into four principal subtypes:37
1. The sibling ancestors received miraculous omens or instructions from
gods.
Introduction 21



The main plot of this type states that a kind brother and his sister receive a
prophecy from a god or goddess that there will be a destructive flood. Usually
they are told to watch for omens of the flood (the eyes of a stone tortoise or a
stone lion will turn red, a mortar will produce water, etc.). Because of the in
struction or warning, the siblings survive the flood by hiding in the stomach of
the stone tortoise or the stone lion. In order to re-create human beings, the sib
lings have to marry each other, but before that, they divine to decide whether
they should do so (if they throw two pieces of millstone separately from two
mountains but the two pieces still touch when they reach the bottom, or if they
create fires on two different mountains but the smoke twists together). After
their marriage, the sister gives birth to humans, or the two create humans by
molding mud. Chen found that although this type of flood myth is spread in Bai,
Manchu, and Hui ethnic groups, it mainly occurs in myths of the Han people.
Therefore, he presumes that this type originated from Han people and was trans
mitted primarily by Hans.
2. The Thunder God’s revenge induced the flood.
This subtype states that two brothers, the Thunder God and the ancestor of
humans (his name differs in different texts), often quarreled with each other. One
day, the human ancestor caught the Thunder God. But when he went out, his
two young children (a brother and his sister; their names differ in different texts)
set the god free. Before the Thunder God went back to heaven, he sent the sib
lings one of his teeth (or sometimes a seed of a gourd or pumpkin) and told them
there would be a huge flood and they should do what they were told. When the
flood came, all humans were destroyed except the brother and sister, who hid in a
big gourd that grew from the seed sent by the Thunder God. In order to re-create
humans, the siblings divined (their methods are various, and some are similar to
the methods mentioned in the first subtype above) and then married. The sister
later gave birth to a gourd. They cut the gourd into pieces, and the pieces turned
into humans. Alternately, they opened the gourd and from it came the ancestors
of many ethnic groups. This type of myth can be found in fifteen ethnic groups
Miao, Yao, Buyi, Dong, Gelao, Hani, Han, Maonan, Mulao, Qiang, She, Shui,
Tujia, Zhuang, and Li—but has been mainly transmitted by Miao people. Chen
presumes that this type might have begun in Miao regions, especially in south
east Guizhou Province, after which it was diffused to other ethnic peoples in dif
ferent regions.
3. The only surviving man sought the Heavenly Maiden.
This subtype states that the human ancestor plowed fields with his siblings.
Every morning after they tilled, they saw that the plowed field had become un
cultivated during the night. They found that a wild boar had done this. When his

22



siblings sought to beat or kill the boar, the human ancestor stopped them. As a
reward, he received a prophecy from a god (disguised as the wild boar) that there
would be a flood. He survived the flood by hiding inside a skin-covered drum (or
a wooden box). He went to heaven and wanted to marry a heavenly maiden. He
passed many tests and finally married the girl. They gave birth to three sons, and
they became the ancestors of the Tibetan, Naxi, and Bai peoples. This type can
be found among Yi, Naxi, Tibetan, Pumi, De’ang, Dulong, Lahu, and Mongol
peoples but mainly is spread in the Yi and Naxi groups.
4. The brother and sister plowed the wilderness.
This subtype is a combination of the three types above. A myth of this type
collected from Gelao people in western Guizhou Province in southwest China
states that two brothers plowed a wild field with their sister. Every morning
they saw that the plowed field had become uncultivated during the night. They
Introduction 23
Among some Han, Miao, Yao, and Tujia ethnic people, the brother-sister couple ancestors are usually worshipped as Nuogong and Nuomu, the god and goddess who originated the ritual of Nuo to drive away devils. (Yang Lihui, Rethinking on the Source Area of the Cult of Nüwa, Beijing Shifan Daxue Chubanshe, 1999)



found that an old man, who in fact was a god, had done this. The god told them
that there would be a flood and instructed the elder brother (who was unkind) to
take refuge in a stone boat, and the kind young brother and sister to hide in a
huge gourd. As a result, the younger brother and the sister were the only sur
vivors of the flood. They divined to learn whether they should marry to re-create
humans (by the similar ways mentioned above). After the verification, they got
married and later gave birth to a son. The son married a heavenly maiden and
they became the ancestors of humans. This type is spread mainly among Yi and
Miao peoples; therefore, Chen has deduced that it may have been formed from a
mix of the different types of flood myths of the Yi and Miao peoples.
Among his conclusions, Chen writes that flood myths in China are quite
rich not only in amount but also in their forms and types. These subtypes show
different social lives and cultural characteristics of different ethnic groups, re
flect ethnic identity, and illustrate the cultural communication and fusion be
tween ethnic groups in China.38 Though his classification and denomination of
the subtypes need further analysis,39 Chen’s research provides a good example of
how a type of myth is spread in many ethnic groups in China, how these myths
relate to or differ from each other in different ethnic groups, and how they are
transformed to fit into different ethnic cultures and social life.
Contexts of Myth Telling in Ethnic Minorities
Similar to the contexts of myth telling among the Han people, myths in other
ethnic groups also are told on common occasions and in rituals. In the Maonan
and Li ethnic groups in southern China, for example, myths are told like other
ordinary spoken arts and are not necessarily told in rituals or special occasions.
Anyone can tell myths, and there is no strict method for myth tellers to learn
the art of telling myths.40 Nevertheless, in her inspirational book about living
myths in Chinese ethnic minorities, Meng Huiying, a folklorist who specializes
in the oral tradition and folk belief of Chinese ethnic minorities, points out that
the typical living myths rely on rituals and other special occasions when myths
are told in heightened performances. Meng divided the rituals in which myths
are told into four types according to their different functions: rituals offering sac
rifices to heaven or ancestors, funeral rites, weddings, and rituals for daily activ
ities such as rites of passage, praying for children, and building a new house. Ex
amples for the first type of ritual come from the Naxi and Achang peoples. When
people in the Naxi ethnic group offer sacrifices to the sky, according to tradition
they will invite a dongba (shaman) to preside over the ritual. In the ritual, the
dongba will chant classic texts (jing), which tell about the origin of their ethnic
group and how this world was created by their ancestor, Renli’en. The Achang
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
24



people divide their ancestors’ souls into two types: dajiagui (literally meaning
“big family ghost”) and xiaojiagui (“little family ghost”). When offering sacri
fices to dajiagui, the shaman will chant a creation epic that lasts one day and
one night. The epic is “Zhepama and Zhemima.” Zhepama and Zhemima were
the first human couple in Achang mythology and belief. The epic describes how
the sky and earth were created by these two ancestors, and how they created hu
mans and cultural artifacts in this world. By chanting the creation epic in this
ritual, people ask for blessings from their divine ancestors. At the same time,
this epic reminds everyone in the community that they are children of the same
ancestors. Thus, the mythic epic can be used to maintain the tradition and bring
together the members of this ethnic community.41
In some ethnic groups, myths are told as part of funeral rites. In the Achang
ethnic group, for example, a person is believed to have three souls. After a person
dies, one soul will be sent into the grave and one soul will be sent to the ances
tors. The third soul will remain in the home to be worshiped. The Achang people
believe that only a shaman can properly arrange the three souls. After someone
dies, the family will invite all members of the community to attend a funeral and
will request that a shaman come and chant the classic texts. Before the shaman
arranges for the souls, he will chant for an entire day. The first part of what he
chants is the creation epic “Zhepama and Zhemima.” Through telling the story
of the first couple and how they created this world and humans, the ritual in
structs the souls and audience who they are and who their ancestors are. The sec
ond part of this ritual is a chant of the history of the nomadic movement of the
ancestors, which aims to tell the soul how to travel to meet the ancestors. So the
creation epic chanted in funeral rites functions to direct the dead soul toward the
ancestors and remind the living that death is not terrible but is a way to leave
this world and live in another land with the divine ancestors. In this way the cre
ation epic consoles the dead and the living, and builds a bridge to communicate
between the dead and the living.42
A third ritual in which myths appear is the wedding. Lan Ke reported how
creation myths were told in a wedding ceremony in 1974 in a Jingpo village in
Yunnan Province of southwest China. The ceremony continued from morning
to night with feasting, music, and dance. When evening came, the singing and
dancing stopped, and guests went into the host’s bamboo house. In the center of
the house, people gathered and sat around a fire pit; then in a very solemn at
mosphere, the jaiwa (shaman) chanted an epic named “Munau Jaiwa.”43 The
main content of this epic is the creation myths and flood myths. It tells that in
remote antiquity a flood destroyed the world. Only a girl and her young brother
survived by hiding in a wooden drum. They were married following the sugges
Introduction 25



tions of the Mountain God. Then they gave birth to a baby that could not eat or
sleep and cried all day. The Mountain God cut the baby into eight parts. Four of
the parts became four men, and the others became four women. Later they be
came the ancestors of some ethnic groups. Among them, the fourth one became
the ancestor of the Jingpo people, and he then made a rule that from then on
Jingpo people should not marry a sibling or a person with the same family name,
and they should choose husbands and wives from certain other clans. This kind
of myth told in rituals serves to confirm traditional history and remind people of
the rules for marriage.44
Other instances in which myths appear include rituals such as praying for
children, rituals when building a new house, rites of passage, and offering sacri
fices to gods. For example, before the middle of the twentieth century, Wa peo
ple in Yunnan Province hunted for human heads to offer to a great god, Muyiji,
who created the sky and earth, and to Xi’aobu (Corn God). Every March and
April before the sowing of crops, people of the same clan went out to hunt for

heads. The heads they found would be placed on altars, and the shaman would
lead the clan in worshiping them, chanting the creation myth Sigangli: In the re
mote past the great god and human ancestor Muyiji ordered one god to create
the earth and another to create the sky, the sun, and the moon. Muyiji created
animals, plants, and humans. He put humans into a stone cave and led a small
bird to peck the stone cave until it opened. The first human to come out was of
the Wa people, followed by Han, Lahu, Dai, and Dan. Gradually the Wa people
learned to settle down, to speak, and to build houses. They asked for seeds from
Muyiji, and Muyiji ordered Xi’aobu to be the corn god. But when the Wa people
planted the seeds they did not sprout, and when the harvesttime came, a flood
destroyed the village. And then Muyiji told the Wa that they should offer human
heads as sacrifices to the gods, and after they did this it would always rain dur
ing planting and growing, and there would be no flood during harvest. Later the
Wa moved to where they live today in Yunnan Province, and their custom of
using heads to offer sacrifices to Muyiji and the corn god was transmitted over
time.45
Myth Tellers in Ethnic Minorities
Myth tellers play significant roles in maintaining myth traditions. By obtaining
relevant knowledge and telling myths to others, they pass on myths from gener
ation to generation and spread myths to many places. Myth tellers endow mean
ing and life to myths. When discussing myth tellers, scholars usually emphasize
the importance of professional shamans. This is true to some degree, but there
are others as well. Three kinds of myth tellers in ethnic groups are discussed
here: shamans, storytellers or singers, and common persons. It should be noted
that these three kinds of myth tellers can be found among the Han people, too.
Shamans. Shamans play an extremely important part in preserving and
transmitting traditional knowledge. Myth telling is often part of the work that a
shaman does. In many places, shamans are known as the individuals who know
the most about myths. In the postscript of his book Mythological Stories of the
Manchu People, Fu Yingren, a Manchu folklore collector and formerly a shaman
himself in Heilongjiang Province of northeast China, introduces the sources of
the myths and sacred stories about gods that he gathered, and also the impor
tance of the shaman in transmitting knowledge about gods. He writes that years
ago, when shamanism was still popular, shamans were not allowed to tell others
at will their knowledge about gods’ origins and achievements. This could only
be done when a shaman was very old, and he/she then told these sacred stories
to his/her favorite students. When the old shaman taught these stories, he/she
and the students had to burn incense, wash their hands, and gargle. The students
Introduction 27



had to kneel down to listen. During the era of the Republic of China, this strict
rule gradually was broken, and Manchu myths were learned by more and more
people. Fu himself became a shaman when he was fifteen years old, but he did
not succeed at this. Afterward he was able to inquire into many myths and
mythological stories because of his former shaman status. Eventually he knew
so much about these stories that even older shamans often learned from him.
The stories he compiled into his book were all told by shamans who were his
relatives.46
A talented Yi folklorist, Bamo Qubumo, has written about the learning ex
perience and performance development of a skilled epic performer of Nuosu
people, a subgroup of the Yi ethnic people in southeast China’s Sichuan
Province. Qumo Yynuo was born into a professional Bimo (shaman) family in
1977. He began to learn to perform rituals from his father when he was seven
years old. When he was fourteen he achieved expert status and began to be a
master of ceremonies by himself. At age fifteen he formally began to study the
kenre (a kind of verbal dueling) tradition. He attended many ceremonies where
he chanted epics in the kenre form, and gradually he became a famous and
skilled epic performer. Among his knowledge about Yi epics, the Hnewo epic
tradition is significant. Hnewo can be chanted at weddings, funerals, and during
soul-sending ceremonies in the specific narrative form of kenre. It has two
forms, female and male. The male parts are all about heaven, and the female
parts are all about the earth. There are twelve acts in the female part, which are
used especially in wedding ceremonies. There are seven acts in the male part,
generally used in funerals and in ceremonies one or two years after a funeral to
send the ghost away to the ancestors. The male part tells how the gods were
summoned by the god of heaven and how they created the sky and the earth;
how one of the gods called the sun and moon, and they appeared; and how the
hero Zhyge Alu shot down the surplus suns and moons. The female part ex
plains why the gods in heaven wanted to create humans, how the snow on earth
came into being, and how it changed. With his extensive knowledge of Yi cul
ture, Qumo has achieved a wide reputation. He not only inherits the shaman
tradition but inherits the epic tradition as well.47
Storytellers and Singers. Talented singers or storytellers can also be impor
tant bearers of mythological tradition. When the Dong people in southern China
offer sacrifices to their ancestors, they gather together to sing songs and dance to
entertain the gods. The ritual can be presided over by a shaman or sometimes by
a middle-aged singer. People who attend will be divided into groups according to
gender. They join hands and make two circles, one inside the other. One circle is
male, the other female. In these circles they will sing and dance. Several people

will lead the singing and others will follow. The content of the songs includes
the creation myths of the Dong people.48
In Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province, in northeast China, there are many
Manchu people. In the 1980s, researchers collected 115 stories from a distin
guished female Manchu storyteller named Li Chengming (1914–). Among the
forty-six stories that were published, there are five myths. These myths explain
how humans were created by the first brother-and-sister couple after the cosmos
was destroyed; why humans lost the paradise of harvesting endless grains be
cause they took these grains for granted; how the sun and the moon were cre
ated, and why people could not look at the sun directly with their eyes; how the
divine maiden Hailun repaired the broken sky; and how the ancestor of the
Manchu people was born after his mother consumed a hawthorn fruit and
miraculously became pregnant. Li’s repertoire of stories came mainly from her
father and grandfather. As an ordinary Chinese farmer, she often told stories to
her neighbors and children during the slow seasons in farming, occasions of

working with other people, or during the relaxed long winter nights on her
warm kang (a brick bed that is warmed by a fire built underneath, popular in
northern China).49 The two collectors of her stories state that in these contexts,
the storytellers in Xiuyan County transmit the wealth of stories they inherit
from previous generations.50
Common People as Bearers of Mythological Tradition. Ordinary people also
bear some traditional mythical knowledge though they are not specifically con
nected to professional or highlighted myth-telling activities. Since their posses
sions of myth are usually fragmented and scarce and they are often reluctant to
tell myths in their daily lives, these people can be called “passive bearers of
myth tradition.”51 When Yang Lihui asked some ordinary pilgrims in the Renzu
Temple complex whether they knew any stories about Fuxi and Nüwa, most of
them could not relate the full myth but did know that humans were created by
the ancestors in the remote past. In another small village in Gansu Province,
northwest China, when Yang asked several old men and women chatting beside
a country road about the flood myth, two of them knew only that there was in
deed a flood in remote antiquity that destroyed almost the whole world. And
then they sighed deeply about the complicated development of this world and
the hardship of their lives. So, though these common people are passive bearers
of myth tradition, they also use mythological material to create their own ways
to express their views and attitudes about history, the world, and their lives.
MYTHS WITHIN CHINESE HISTORY AND SOCIETY
Myths are neither static nor separate from society. Rather, their existence and
transmission are deeply influenced by their social and cultural contexts. In this
section, myths in the Chinese language will be put into the context of Chinese
history and society. The purpose of this is to illustrate how Chinese myths have
continually been transmitted and shaped during the past thousands of years. This
section will pay special attention to these questions: How were myths thought
about, recorded, and changed in different periods of Chinese history? Who was in
volved in this? Why did people record myths? And how were myths used and re
constructed as an important cultural resource to serve people’s needs?
It may be important to remind readers that the examples used in this sec
tion are chosen from the authors’ standpoint. Others may select different exam
ples and find different aspects of Chinese history and society to relate to myths.
Additionally, since information in written documents about how common Chi
nese people thought about and told myths in ancient China is limited, the de

counts but also of silk paintings, funerary stone carvings, cliff paintings, inscrip

The Pre–Qin Dynasty Period (before 256 BC)
Many Chinese scholars believe that the emergence of myth is intimately related
to the beginning of clan societies. They deduce that Chinese myths might have
been created at least 10,000 years ago with the advent of clan societies, flourish
ing when clan societies were well developed in the middle to late Neolithic era.
This hypothesis has been partially confirmed by archeological data. In 1930, for
example, Shandingdong Man, dating to about 18,000 years ago, was found at
Zhoukoudian, in the Fangshan district of Beijing. Many Chinese archeologists
think that Shandingdong Man shows that the social organization of the people
had already changed from primitive society to a clan community. Some believe
that Shandingdong people had a belief in the existence of the soul. Some schol
ars even assume that Shandingdong Man might have known some basic and
simple myths to accompany those beliefs.52
In the middle to late Neolithic era of 3,500–7,000 years ago, prehistoric people
within the modern boundaries of China had some complicated ideas related to
myths. The patterns and decorations molded or carved on stone, jade, bone, wood,
and pottery tell mythical stories. Comparing these relics with ancient writings,
we may get an idea about the myths of that time. In Hemudu village in Yuyao
County, Zhejiang Province, a bone dagger was found in 1973 that dated back to
7,000 years ago. On the handle of the dagger was a carved pattern depicting two
symmetrical birds carrying the sun.53 This motif of a bird carrying the sun can
also be widely found on pottery in many cultural relics from modern Gansu,
Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces. Classified as the Miaodigou Type of Yang
shao Culture (a Neolithic culture of central China), these relics are usually dated
to 6,000 years ago. In these relics the bird carrying the sun is sometimes depicted
with three legs. This same motif can be found in myths recorded in ancient writ
ings, such as Shanhaijing, Huainanzi, and Lunheng (Critical Essays, written by
Wang Chong, 27–ca. 100 CE). According to these texts, there was a crow settling
on the sun (some versions say there were ten crows settling on ten suns). The
crow functions as the spirit of the sun or, variously, the one who carries the sun
across the sky. Sometimes the bird is said to be three-legged. According to an ac
count in Shanhaijing (chapter 14), there was a huge tree named Fusang (Leaning
Mulberry) in the eastern Tang Valley. In its branches rested the ten suns. As soon
as one sun came back from its journey crossing the sky, another sun started forth.
Each of the ten suns was carried by a crow. An earlier text, “Tianwen,” ambigu
ously mentions the crow of the sun in the story of Yi, asking: “Why did Yi shoot
down the suns? Why did the crows shed their feathers?” Wang Yi (ca. second cen
tury CE), the commentator of “Tianwen,” cited a paragraph from Huainanzi to ex
plain these questions, stating that at the time of Yao (a demigod of the three sage
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
32



kings), the ten suns rose together and burned up the woods and grass. Yao then or
dered the hero Yi to shoot down the ten suns in the sky, and Yi shot down nine of
them. The nine crows settling on these suns died, and their feathers fell out. In
later versions, the crow of the sun is sometimes said to be three-legged. So it can
be concluded to some degree that in the middle to late Neolithic era, the mythical
motif of a bird carrying the sun or a bird settling on the sun (the number may be
interpreted as plural) is already quite developed. Those written myths are not just
single occurrences of such mythical ideas. Instead, they receive support from arti
facts found by archaeologists. It may be further assumed that the designs carved
on bone or other materials were telling the sun myth in another way, not in spo
ken language, but in drawings and engravings.
During the Zhou dynasty (1046 BC–256 BC), written records about ancient
myths in the Chinese language became more and more visible. An obvious rea
son for this is the mature writing system of the Zhou. From these records and
comments on myths, we can see that Zhou culture and society had an impact on
people’s views about myth, and thus influenced the transmission and transfor
mation of ancient myths.
The first example demonstrating this relates to the rationalism during the
Eastern Zhou dynasty (770 BC–256 BC) and Confucius’s historicizing interpreta
tion of the Kui myth. Chinese intellectuals began to rationalize and historicize
myths at a very early time.54 During the Eastern Zhou dynasty this became
more popular.55 Many intellectuals doubted the reality and authenticity of
myths (such as the great poet Qu Yuan), and some of them further interpreted
myths by rationalizing or historicizing them. A typical example is Confucius’s
historicizing interpretation of the Kui myth. Kui is a one-legged mythical mon
ster. According to Shanhaijing (chapter 14), Kui was said to be a divine beast
who lived on Mount Liubo (liubo literally means “flowing wave”) in the East
Sea. It looked like an ox but was gray, hornless, and one-legged. Whenever it
came out or dived into the sea, a storm would follow. Its light was like the sun
light and moonlight, and its sound was like thunder. Later it was caught and
killed by Huang Di, who made a drum by using its hide as the cover. When
struck with the bone of the Thunder God, the drum made a great sound that
could be heard over five hundred miles away. Huang Di used the drum to show
his power to the whole world. In some versions, this drum made of Kui’s skin
played an important role in the battle between Huang Di and Chiyou, the god of
war and the inventor of military weapons. Huang Di beat the drum many times
during the war. The sound it made was so great that it prevented Chiyou from
flying away; thus Chiyou was caught and beheaded by Huang Di.
But Confucius cunningly demythologized the Kui myth and rationalized it
as real history. According to a story in Lüshi Chunqiu (Annals of Master Lü,
Introduction 33



third century BC), a king of the Lu state felt strange about Kui’s image, so he
asked the erudite Confucius whether Kui was in fact one-legged, which is pro
nounced yi zu in Chinese. Confucius replied that the meaning of yi zu is actu
ally “one is enough.” In Chinese, the word yi means “one,” and the word zu can
be understood as both “foot” and “enough.” So, yi zu can be interpreted as both
“one leg” and “one is enough.” Confucius used the term zu as a pun to create a
fabled lesson from the Kui myth. He described Kui as an accomplished and tal
ented official who contributed much to society. He explained that Kui was the
master of music for the sage king Shun, and he adjusted musical tuning and har
monized music. People became convinced that Kui was indeed a model official.
Therefore, Confucius explained, if an emperor had an excellent official like Kui,
one was enough. In this way, Confucius skillfully dissolved this myth and ra
tionalized the Kui story. He cunningly turned Kui, the one-legged mythical
monster, into a virtuous and talented historical official.
Using similar methods, Confucius also rationalized myths that “Huang Di
lived for three hundred years” and “Huang Di had four faces.” These anecdotes

were frequently cited in later years by many Confucianists. His rational attitude
provides an exemplary model for pragmatically dealing with myth and legend.
As the founder and representative of Confucianism, Confucius was not in
terested in the supernatural realm, though he did not obviously argue against the
existence of gods and ghosts. He paid attention to what he considered real in life
instead of oddities, violence, disorder, and spirits. Derk Bodde asserts that Confu
cius’s attitude toward myth relates to Confucianism. The Confucianists were,
more than any other school of thought, “historically minded,” and “always in
tensely interested in the search for historical precedents which would confirm
their own social and political doctrines; on the other hand, their strong human
ism tended to make them either indifferent toward supernatural matters, or to
seek to explain them in purely rationalistic terms.”56 Zhong Jingwen and Yang
Lihui argue that on a wider scale, rationalism was quite common throughout
world mythology in certain periods of time. Its emergence also has to do with the
development of rational intellect.57 Some scholars find that the rationalism often
used by Chinese scholars in ancient times is just the opposite of euhemerism in
Greek studies. Coming from a novel written by a Greek writer, Euhemerus (late
fourth century BC), the term euhemerism refers to the modification of human
hero kings to gods. In contrast, Chinese scholars regularly eliminated the super
natural or marvelous elements in a myth that seemed to them improbable, and
then interpreted myths as real history, and the gods as humans.
Another example from the Eastern Zhou dynasty illustrates the political
struggle, the integration of ethnic groups, and the systematization of a pantheon
of gods during that period. During the Spring and Autumn period (770 BC–476 BC,
the first era of the Eastern Zhou), there were many clans living within the
boundaries of modern China. Besides the four main ethnic groups of Xia, Shang,
Ji, and Jiang, who lived in the Central Plain and formed the primary part of the
Huaxia people (the predecessor of the Han people), there were more than one
hundred small states and ethnic groups around the areas that now belong to
Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. These ethnic
groups all have their own divine ancestors and myths about their ancestors’
miraculous birth and marvelous achievements. For example, Shang people be
lieve that the founder of the Shang, Qi, came from a swallow that was sent down
by heaven, whereas Zhou people confirm that their founder, Qi (different from
the Shang’s Qi), was born after his mother, Jiang Yuan, stepped into a huge foot
print and became pregnant.
However, the situation began to change considerably during the Warring
States era (475 BC–256 BC, the latter era of the Eastern Zhou). At that time, these
states began to fight and integrate with each other. During the early part of the
Introduction 35



Warring States era, there were just over ten states remaining. Among them, the
most powerful were the seven states of Qin, Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, and Wei.
They struggled to annex other states and expand their land and power. In order
to facilitate the amalgamation, to break up the substantial divide between states
and ethnic groups, the formerly scattered and independent divine ancestors were
connected and re-created into a new pantheon of gods. According to the brilliant
historian Gu Jiegang’s (1893–1980) research, the divine ancestor of the Chu peo
ple was originally Zhurong, but at this time he was changed to Zhuanxu; the an
cestor of the Qin was originally born by Nüxiu after she consumed an egg
dropped by a swallow, but then he also became the offspring of Zhuanxu. The
northern ethnic group Hun (Xiongnu) and the south Yue were originally unre
lated to each other and to Huaxia, but then they all became descendants of Yu,
who was also said to be a progeny of Zhuanxu in late tradition. Since there were
many unrelated gods and ancestors from different ethnic groups now in a new
pantheon, scholars in the Warring States era rearranged their relationship to
solve the problem: they changed their synchronic relationship to a diachronic
one. The two adversary peoples, Shang and Zhou, were suddenly depicted as a
brotherhood; the mothers of their founders were supposed to be the wives of the
supreme god Di Ku.58 Moreover, later both Zhuanxu and Di Ku became descen
dants of Huang Di. In this way, these states and ethnic groups were all attributed
to the same lineage, and the amalgamation (especially the bigger states annexing
the smaller ones) was thus proved reasonable.59
The Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 CE)
Historians consider the Qin and Han dynasties as the first Chinese empire.
Though the Qin dynasty is famous in later years for the Great Wall and the Ter
racotta Warriors (thousands of life-size pottery warriors, horses, and weapons
that were unearthed in the 1970s), it was quickly overthrown by the Han dy
nasty in 206 BC, only fifteen years after it unified the country. The Han dynasty
not only boasted a much longer vitality (426 years) but also was very influential
in Chinese society and culture long after it ended. Even today, the majority of
Chinese people are called “Han,” the Chinese language is called “the Han Lan
guage,” and the Chinese writing system is called “Han Characters.”
Written myth texts in the Han dynasty enjoy an important significance in
Chinese mythology. Scholars often use the myths that appeared in Han record
ings when they investigate myths in early times of ancient China. Myths in Han
recordings usually are more complete and detailed, whereas recordings before

the Qin dynasty (primarily the Zhou dynasty) tend to be fragmented and were
frequently historicized. Even so, Han writers adopted many living myths from
popular tradition into their writings, so they sometimes provided new myth ver
sions. For this reason, although Han writings appeared later than the myths
written before the Qin, it does not necessarily mean that myths in Han texts
emerged later than those of earlier texts. They might have been popular in ear
lier times and only were recorded in later years by Han writers.
In the first general history book of China, Shiji (Historical Records), written
by exemplary historian Sima Qian (ca. 145–ca. 86 BC), a number of myths, to
gether with various legends, folktales, and popular customs, are described.
Among them are myths of the Five August Emperors (names differ in different
texts; in this book, they are Huang Di, Zhuanxu, Di Ku, Yao, and Shun), the re
mote ancestors of Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Chu peoples. These myths came from
earlier written literature, but sometimes they also took their sources from popu
lar living tradition. For instance, the myth of the Shang founder Qi says that
Jiandi is a daughter of the Yousong clan and is the second concubine of Di Ku.
One day, when she went out to bathe with Di Ku, she saw a swallow dropping
an egg. She picked it up and swallowed it. Then she inexplicably became preg
nant, and later gave birth to Qi. Compared to the earlier two texts appearing in
Shijing (The Classic of Poetry, compiled in or before 500 BC) and “Tianwen,” the
story in Shiji is more complete and contains several details that cannot be found
in the former two texts. Besides this, Shiji provides a different version of the
miraculous birth story of Houji, Zhou’s founder. Guo Biheng deduces in his dis
sertation that Sima Qian might have adopted these myth versions from living
oral tradition.60
When discussing the reason why Sima Qian used abundant material from
living popular tradition to write a historical book, Guo Biheng notes the lack of
written sources in the early ages of the Western Han. After Qinshihuang (the
First Emperor) of Qin unified China, he and his assistants felt that those earlier
classic writings of philosophy and of histories of other sizeable states were sub
versive to their rule. To eliminate these potential dangers, in 213 BC they burned
all books except for the ones on agriculture, medicine, and divination, as well as
the ones collected by the Qin government. But soon after that, in 209 BC, when
the leading rebel, Xiang Yu, overthrew the Qin, he burned the Qin palace and
those books stored by the Qin government. These two fires destroyed almost all
of the books written before this time. For this reason, in the Western Han dy
nasty, intellectuals were busy rewriting classics of earlier times by recalling
them from memory, or by finding new sources from living tradition. This was
the case when Sima Qian began to write his historical book. Finding the earlier
Introduction 37



historical accounts severely defi
cient, he had to rely on the living
popular custom and oral tradition to
supplement the shortcoming.61
What’s more, he spent several years
visiting places that now belong to
Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang,
Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan
provinces. He collected abundant
historical materials, among them
rich folk literature.
But Sima Qian did not accept
all the myths he received from oral
tradition and writings. Instead, he
selected what he wanted and re
worked them into his book. The
history in his book begins with the
story of the five emperors (appar
ently he did not take the Three Di
vine Sovereigns as the start because
their achievements are more im
plausible). When he dealt with hun
dreds of stories about Huang Di, he cast away those versions too vulgar and
spectacular for him, and he selected what he felt to be “elegant.” According to
myths about the battle between Huang Di and Chiyou, when Chiyou attacked
Huang Di, Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack against him in
the wilderness. Yinglong began by storing all of the water. Chiyou asked the
wind god and rain master to release a cloudburst. Then Huang Di asked the god
dess of drought to descend from the heavens, and the rain was stopped. Eventu
ally Huang Di killed Chiyou. Other stories state that Chiyou was able to soar
into the sky and overcome the dangerous and difficult obstructions. But Huang
Di made a drum from the hide of Kui and beat it many times. The sound it made
was so great that it prevented Chiyou from flying away. So Chiyou was caught
and killed by Huang Di. Another version states that Chiyou led many ferocious
mythical animals to attack Huang Di at the Zhuolu plain. So Huang Di ordered
his subjects to blow horns sounding like dragons to threaten them. Sima Qian
did not put all of these myth versions into his own rendition of the Huang Di
story. About this fierce battle, he says only that Chiyou was a duke under the
administration of Huang Di. He did not obey Huang Di and later rebelled against

38
Sima Qian (Instructional Resources Corporation)



him. Thus Huang Di called up an army of other dukes and fought with Chiyou.
Chiyou was killed at last, and Huang Di was respected by the dukes as “the Son
of Heaven.” Obviously, Sima Qian abandoned these “mysterious” or “absurd”
myths about this battle between gods. Furthermore, he historicized stories that
he felt were relevant, as most ancient scholars did in their works.
Toward the late Han dynasty, the predominantly Confucian thought in the
Western Han became weakened within society. The “Five Elements” (metal,
wood, water, fire, and earth, which were thought to be the basic substances of
the world and were sometimes used to explain the origin of all things in the
world, or a person’s fate) and divination, combined with pseudoscientific reason
ing, became extremely popular. Many people believed in mystical prophecy and
superstition. In this social context, a philosopher named Wang Chong (27–ca.
100 CE) wrote the book Lunheng (Critical Essays), criticizing this kind of social
phenomenon. He argued that superstitions and mystical prophecies were un
true. His evidence mainly came from real-life experiences. In his book he cited
plenty of myths, such as that Nüwa repaired the broken sky, Yi shot down the
ten suns, Cangjie invented Chinese characters, Jiandi devoured a swallow egg
and gave birth to Qi, Jiang Yuan stepped into a huge footprint and gave birth to
Houji, Gonggong butted into a pillar of the sky, and many others. Wang Chong’s
purpose was not to record living myths, though, but to use his experiences to
demonstrate that these “popular sayings” or superstitions were unfounded. For
example, he argued that the myth that Nüwa repaired the broken sky was non
sense. He reasoned that the heavens could not be made of stone and that as a
human, Nüwa could not reach it to repair the sky with melted stones. He
recorded myths in order to criticize them using the argument of common sense.
His ideas represent the belief that myths are false knowledge, which is opposite
to the idea that myths are historical. His ideas found many supporters in later
times as others criticized myth as superstition in other periods of history, even
today.
After Han through the Qing Dynasty (220–1911 CE)
Many Chinese people feel that all of Chinese history is a series of dynastic cir
cles, because almost every dynasty repeats a similar story: a heroic founding, an
arduous establishment, a prosperous period, a long decline, revolt and rebellion,
collapse, and replacement by a new dynasty. Writing about the Han dynasty in
the book China: Tradition and Transformation, sinologist John K. Fairbank
shares this impression, and he thus comments that “as a result, the tremendous
Introduction 39



growth and development of Chinese civilization has been all but hidden behind
this apparent circular motion in human affairs, and the later history is made
into a series of more or less successful attempts to repeat the story of the Earlier
Han.”62
Even so, every dynasty has its own characteristics and problems. After the
Han dynasty, China continued to develop and change. During the 1,700 years
since the end of the Han dynasty, China has experienced many dynastic changes
and cultural expansions, such as the Southern and Northern dynasties
(420–589), a period when many ethnic cultures integrated on a large scale; the
Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) dynasties, in which Chinese culture flour
ished; and the Yuan (1206–1368) and Qing (1616–1911) dynasties, when China
was taken under the rule of “Barbarians,” the Mongols and Manchu. In the Qing
dynasty, traditional China reached its peak.63
Though this period is not as prolific as the pre-Qin through Han dynasties,
there are still some remarkable commentaries on classical myths found in docu
ments and literature. These writings about myths are also directly related to the
societies in which they existed. Two examples will illustrate this. The first re
lates to the strong interest in mysteries in the Wei (220–265) and Jin (265–420)
dynasties and Gan Bao’s (ca. fourth century) Soushenji (In Search of the Super
natural). The second relates to nationalism in the late Qing dynasty and com
ments and uses of the ancestors’ miraculous birth myth.
Orthodox Confucianism was discredited by the end of the Eastern Han.
During the Wei and Jin dynasties the general interest of philosophy shifted from
Confucianism to Taoism and metaphysical philosophy and scriptures. Literati
and scholars engaged in highly sophisticated discussions. The Buddhists also
used discussion to defend their theories. Taoism had been prevalent during the
Han dynasty; now, in a time of political, social, and economic instability, intel
lectuals became more interested in searching for an essential view of the uni
verse. In their “pure conversations” (qingtan), literati and scholars tried to find
out the “Great Mystery” of the world; hence the philosophical streams of the Jin
period are called “The School of Mysteries” (Xuanxue). In correspondence to
their strong interests in mystery, many literati and scholars were fond of talking
about strange and miraculous phenomena: stories about gods, immortals,
ghosts, and their powers. They even collected some of these mysteries and com
piled them into books. Such works include Zhang Hua’s Bowuzhi (A Treatise on
Research into Nature), Guo Pu’s commentary on Shanhaijing, Gan Bao’s
Soushenji, Ge Hong’s Shenxianzhuan (Bibliographies of Immortals), and Wang
Jia’s Shiyiji (Researches into Lost Records), along with many others. Among
them, Gan Bao’s Soushenji is one of the most representative.

Gan Bao was a historian and a member of the literati during the Eastern Jin
dynasty (317–420). Influenced by the prevailing interest in mystery, he liked to
probe into the occult arts (generally including divination, astrology, and geo
mancy). Two anecdotes explain Gan Bao’s motivation for writing Soushenji. One
says that his father’s servant-girl was buried with his father when he died, but
after more than ten years, when the grave was opened, the servant-girl was alive
and said the dead man often fetched food for her. Another story depicts that his
elder brother died and several days later was revived. He said he had seen some
gods and ghosts. These stories touched Gan Bao. He then examined ancient writ
ings to seek other stories about strange and marvelous things. To enrich his com
pilation, he interviewed many elderly people and widely collected myths, leg
ends, and stories from oral tradition. His purpose was to prove that strange and
mystical things could happen, and that gods and ghosts really exist. The original
book he wrote was lost before the Southern Song dynasty. The version that exists
today was compiled by a Ming scholar named Hu Yingling.
In this book, Gan Bao recorded many myths. Some Chinese mythologists be
lieve that Soushenji is the second-best book to preserve ancient myths (the one
considered to be the best is Shanhaijing).64 The myths recorded in this text in
clude those of Shennong, Chisongzi (the rain master of Shennong), Feng Bo, Yu
Shi, Zhuanxu’s three sons, the sage king Shun, Xiwangmu, Chang’e, Panhu, and
King Fuyu. Most records of these myths are sketchy in detail, though some are
very thorough, such as the Panhu myth (wherein a dog married a girl and they be
came ancestors of some southern ethnic peoples). Sometimes it even provides
different versions of the same story type. In chapter 20, for example, a kind old
woman was said to have received a divine prophecy as a reward for her benevo
lence. She was told that her city would soon be sunk when the eyes of a stone
tortoise turned red. The old lady went to see the tortoise every day. When a child
learned what this lady was doing, he sneakily rubbed red color onto the tortoise’s
eyes. The old woman went out of the city, led by a dragon. Soon afterwards the
city sunk and became a lake. A similar story can be found in chapter 13. These
accounts provide valuable sources for mythology and folk narrative research.
In 1644 the Manchu people, who originally lived in the northeast area of
modern China, successfully broke through the Great Wall and became the new
rulers of China. The Manchu dynasty developed traditional China to its height
in the eighteen century but declined in the nineteenth century. In 1912, with
the last emperor’s abdication, the Qing dynasty ended, marking the end of an
cient Chinese empires.
In the late Qing dynasty, China faced a string of crises: the central govern
ment’s corruption and disability, oppression of the rulers from another ethnic
Introduction 41



group, imperialist invasion, relinquishing of territory and compensation to other
countries, the Boxer Movement, and new ideas about China’s modernization. In
tellectuals commonly considered these crises the Qing government’s fault.
Some suggested the government should reform, and others hoped the Manchu
rulers would be overthrown and a new state would be established. Nationalism
increased dramatically. In this atmosphere, many radical nationalists wanted to
distinguish the differences among ethnic groups and tried to summon people to
resist the domination of the Manchu. Their leader, Sun Yatsen (1866–1925),
called on people to dispel “the barbarians” from central China and recover Han
conventions. To serve their strong political purposes, many revolutionary schol
ars discussed myths about the origins of clans. In his book Huangshi (History of
the Yellow), Huang Jie examined ancient writings of the myths of clan origins,
arguing that the ancestors of all ethnic groups except Han came from nonhu
mans. For example, he suggested that the people from southern ethnic groups
descended from a dog, and the Tubo, an ancient ethnic group, also descended
from a dog. Tujue, another group, came from a female wolf. The Gaoche ethnic
group came from a male wolf, and the Dangxiang and Qiang came from a mon
key. Huang Jie wrote that these people who came from the marriage between
man and animal were so shameful that the sun and the moon would lose their
light. Through his research, he strove to show the excellence of Han Chinese in
race and culture. By this means Huang wanted to propagate the idea that Han
people should resist being ruled by the Manchu government. He suggested that
all Han should unite together to fight for this cause.65 Another scholar, Chen
Qubing, utilized the clan origin myth of Manchu to criticize Manchu people in
his book Qing Mishi (The Secret History of Qing). The Manchu origin myth
states that two or three girls were bathing in a lake when a magpie carrying a red
hawthorn fruit in its mouth passed by, dropping the fruit. One of the girls caught
the fruit and ate it. She then became pregnant. Later she gave birth to a boy and
named him Aixinjueluo. Soon after, he became the ancestor of the Manchu peo
ple. Chen compared this story to the similar origin myth of the Shang people,
the Han predecessors. Chen concluded that it was disgraceful that the Manchu
people only knew their mother but not their father, and they did not know the
difference between man and animal since their ancestors came from a bird. He
wrote that the myth showed that Manchu people wanted to deceive others to
believe that they came from a divine origin. However, Chen states, the similar
miraculous events in the Shang myth were not amazing in the beginning, but
were later distorted by other writers. In this way, Chen tried to make the Shang
myth sound reasonable and the Manchu myth sound absurd. His deeper goal
was to demonstrate the superiority of the Han and the inferiority of the

Manchu. These radical nationalists used myth as a significant cultural resource
to serve their political purpose of overthrowing the Manchu dynasty.
Republic of China (1912–1949)
Beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century, China suffered a series of
failures and setbacks during conflicts with other foreign powers. As a result,
China was forced to open itself to the world and became a semicolonial country.
Even after the fall of the Manchu dynasty and the establishment of the Republic
of China, China was still often oppressed and bullied by other foreign forces.
Stimulated and shamed by these failures, at the end of the nineteenth century
and the early part of the twentieth century, many patriotic intellectuals began to
search for the reasons why China was so easily defeated by those “barbarians,”
and tried to uncover the “foul diseases” in Chinese politics, ethics, thought, and
scholarship. They attributed one of the main reasons to Chinese traditional cul
ture—a shackle, in their view, that suppressed humanity, creativity, and democ
racy. They intensely criticized traditional culture, primarily written culture cre
ated and carried by ancient nobles and intellectuals, and they hoped to build a
new national, scientific, and democratic culture to educate Chinese people and,
furthermore, to reconstruct a unified, independent, strong, and modernized
China. In 1915 a group of professors at Peking University started a New Culture
Movement to fight against Confucianism (which stressed obedience and hierar
chy in social relationships), old literature, and the inflexible classical written
language. These scholars were advocates for a new culture of antiimperialism
and antifeudalism and a new body of literature written in vernacular Chinese.
This movement culminated in the May Fourth Movement of 1919 and lasted to
the 1920s. They built this new culture mainly by exploring the values of native
folk culture and learning from Western and Japanese culture and scientific tech
nology. Therefore, there arose an enthusiasm among intellectuals for studying
Chinese folklore as well as foreign scholarship. Folk songs and stories were
widely collected and researched, and Western concepts (such as democracy,
equality, and liberty) and various social and philosophical thoughts and theories
then current in the Western world and Japan (such as Marxism, realism, utilitar
ianism, pragmatism, and individualism) were introduced to China.
In this circumstance, myth received much academic attention. In fact, Chi
nese mythology as a subject in a modern sense is commonly thought to formally
have begun in 1902, when the word shenhua (myth) was translated from Japanese
into Chinese for the first time. Later, during the New Culture Movement, with
Introduction 43



opened eyes and much knowledge about Western and Japanese scholarship, many
scholars began to study Chinese myths and compare them with myths of India,
Greece, and northern Europe. The most popular foreign theory they applied was
from the English Anthropological School, mainly from E. B. Tylor (1832–1917), J.
G. Frazer (1854–1941), and especially Andrew Lang (1844–1913).66 Maodun (whose
real name is Shen Yanbin, 1896–1981), one of the forerunners of modern Chinese
mythologists, began to be interested in myth in 1918. At that time he read some
English books about the myths and legends of Greece, Rome, India, and Egypt, and
some theoretical books about the Anthropological School. From 1925 to 1930 he
utilized its theory to discuss myths with regard to meaning, classification, origin,
and preservation. He also compared
Chinese myths to those of Greece
and northern Europe. From today’s
viewpoint, many of his explanations
seem superficial, merely mechanical
applications of the anthropological
school theory. However, he is the
first Chinese mythologist to system
atically study ancient Chinese
myths by using Western mythologi
cal theory.
In 1937 the Japanese army in
vaded China, and the War of Resis
tance against Japan (1937–1945)
broke out. To avoid the war, the
central government and many insti
tutes and universities in northern
China were compelled to move to
the south. The formerly isolated
border area now became the cul
tural center. Scholars and students
from different disciplines swarmed
there. Because of the absence of ref
erence books in the border area,
many scholars had to pay attention
to rich ethnic cultures and living
oral tradition. This produced a new
stage of Chinese myth study. Many
scholars of literature, sociology, an

thropology, linguistics, and history investigated living myths, rituals, and beliefs
of the ethnic minorities and then compared them to the versions recorded in an
cient Chinese writings. Myth was thus probed by putting it into living social
and cultural contexts. Functions and social roles of myths were emphasized. Ad
ditionally, many scholars in this period studied myth from multiple points of
view of different disciplines. A representative scholar of this period is Wen
Yiduo (1899–1946), a professor at Qinghua University. His study of myth began
in the middle of the 1930s and flourished during the War of Resistance against
Japan. He wrote several influential articles discussing myths about Jiang Yuan,
Fuxi and Nüwa, dragons, immortals, and others. When examining the Fuxi
myth, he analyzed various sources not only from classical written documents
but also from orally told myths (from Miao, Yao, and other ethnic peoples) and
from archeological relics. He examined the intrinsic relationship between myth
and social life from multiple points of view. In an article, he listed forty-nine
brother-sister marriage myth versions collected by other ethnographers from
Miao, Yao, and other ethnic peoples to demonstrate that Fuxi and Nüwa were in
fact gourds. Therefore, the gourd, according to his research, was actually the
common ancestor of humans in primitive thought. Though some of his conclu
sions need more support, his approach of studying myth from multiple points of
view still inspires today’s mythological study.
The People’s Republic of China (1949–Present)
In 1949 the Gongchantang (CCP, or Chinese Communist Party) defeated the
Kuomintang (KMT, or National People’s Party), the party in power during the
Republic of China, and became the new government of the People’s Republic of
China (PRC). Having experienced large-scale development and demolishment
(especially in “the Great Leap Forward” of 1958–1959 and “the Cultural Revolu
tion” of 1966–1976) during the time of Mao Zedong (the highest leader of the
CCP, from the 1930s to 1976), with the beginning of Deng Xiaoping’s leadership
in 1978 China quickened its pace toward an open, strong, and modernized coun
try. Mao’s extreme policy of encouraging “class struggle” was replaced by Deng’s
policy of developing the economy and improving productivity. China’s current
leadership has continued these policies, securing for China a more important
and active role in the global political and economic realms.
These considerable social and political changes have also deeply influenced
myth. Corresponding to these changes, myths in the PRC have gone through two
stages. The first stage is from 1949 to 1976, when myths were deeply impacted by
Introduction 45



political ideology, especially in the
period of the Cultural Revolution.
The second stage is from 1978
through the present, when myths
have been comparatively released
from strong political influences and
have been revived and recon
structed.
1949–1976
During this first period, attitudes to
ward myth seemed contradictory.
On one hand, myths were perceived
to be created by common laborers,
showing the positive efforts of
human beings to try to explain and
control the world. Mao Zedong, for
example, often cited and rewrote
myths in his articles or poems. He
especially enjoyed using myths re
lated to rebel gods or demigods, such
as the myth of Gonggong fighting
against Zhuanxu to be the Supreme
Divinity and butting Mount Buzhou
in his failure. In using this story,
Mao, as an outstanding revolution
ist, showed his praise of the rebel
lion against the established order.
On the other hand, however, myths were also thought to be negative and passive.
This is mainly because myths were usually connected with folk belief, which was
considered superstitious and harmful since it encouraged people to obey nature
and gods. During the Cultural Revolution, especially in the Po Si Jiu (Destroy the
Four Old Things) Campaign, which started in 1966, all “old thoughts, old cul
ture, old customs, and old habits” were called on to be eliminated since these
were perceived as belonging to the exploiting class and as being backward and
improper for the development of socialism. Among the “olds” to be abolished,
folk belief stood in obvious violation. In a short period of time, temples, statues
of gods, and stories about gods were all considered to be old superstition and thus
were destroyed. In the Renzu Temple complex in Henan Province, for instance,
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
46
Mao Zedong (Bettman/Corbis)



several statues including Nüwa’s were demolished along with Fuxi’s mausoleum,
and Fuxi was dishonored by his statue being paraded through the streets. The
temple fair was banned. People were prevented from openly telling myths and
visiting the temple for worship, though some of them occasionally went in se
cret.67 During this time, telling myths became taboo. Even in 1993, when Yang
Lihui did field research at Renzu, some myth tellers were still hesitant to tell
myths about Fuxi and Nüwa. When asked by acquaintances what they were
doing, some myth tellers laughed at themselves and disclaimed that they were
“telling old superstitions.” The answer was obviously a strategy: through ac
tively admitting their own backwardness, the myth tellers hoped to protect
themselves from political pressure.
1978–Today
Since 1978, China has become more open. The central government has focused its
attention on developing the national economy, and it has become more tolerant of
folk tradition. Folk beliefs and myths that had been suppressed as feudal supersti
tion have received more space to exist in society. Since the 1980s, especially since
the mid-1990s, many local governments have used folk traditions (including
myth) as cultural resources to build local identity and to develop the local econ
omy through the marketing of these ideas to locals and tourists. This strategy is
vividly described in the phrase “Culture builds the stage, and economy plays the
opera.” In many cases the central government, local governments, local commu
nities, and tourists all come together to revive folk traditions. For example, the
Renzu Festival in Huaiyang County was banned during the Cultural Revolution,
but in 1993 the temple fair had not only been restored but the local government
and local community were also planning to rebuild the statues that had been de
stroyed, including Nüwa’s. In Hou village, Hongdong County, Shanxi Province,
the destroyed Nüwa temple was rebuilt in 1999. The process of revival has in
volved many interplaying factors. It is supported by the local government, which
hopes to propagate and develop the local economy by promoting a unique local
culture. The temple was designed by local folk intellectuals who hope to restore
the old tradition. Many villagers have engaged in the act of rebuilding the temple,
hoping to get both economic benefits and the goddess’s blessing.68 With the re
building of these Nüwa temples, related Nüwa myths have been told again. Peo
ple use relevant myths to validate their special relationship with Nüwa and to
find meaning for their current activities. They also use myths to create a local
identity. All in all, they utilize myths to serve their modern life.
In summary, the discussion in this section illustrates that myths are an or
ganic part of the whole social and cultural system and are intimately connected
Introduction 47



with other social and cultural phenomena, such as belief, politics, economy, eth
nic identity, morals, and science. Which myths are chosen to be written down,
why myths are retold or reconstructed, how myths are evaluated and studied,
and whether myths are praised or oppressed are often related to certain social,
historical, and cultural contexts. From the relationships among myth, history,
and society one can get an idea of how Chinese society and culture have contin
ually changed and developed, and how these changes and developments deeply
influence the transmission and transformation of living myths within these
contexts.
INFLUENCE OF MYTH ON CHINESE CULTURE AND SOCIETY
The influence of Chinese history and society on myths is only one side of the
picture. On the other side, those myths that have been handed down for thou

sands of years and contain Chinese people’s philosophy, art, beliefs, customs,
and value systems also have a great influence on Chinese society and culture.
Influence of Myth on Belief
Myths tell stories about gods. Their rise is intimately related to people’s beliefs.
In China, those gods who play the main roles in myths are also usually the ones
worshiped as the central part of belief systems. In She County, Hebei Province,
in northern China, for example, there is a large Nüwa palace said to have been
built during the Ming dynasty. On every lunar March 15 to 18, there is a Nüwa
palace festival. A lot of people from nearby cities and villages visit the palace to
worship Nüwa. Nüwa myths are actively transmitted during this occasion, to
gether with some belief legends that are told to prove Nüwa’s power and effi
cacy. One legend states that a daughter-in-law had great filial piety toward her
father-in-law. She was so considerate of him that every night in the winter she
warmed the quilt for him to sleep with. Rumors about a sexual relationship
spread in the community. This young woman felt she was seriously misunder
stood, so, one year when she went to worship Nüwa during the temple fair, she
jumped from the top of the temple into a large incense pot to test her innocence.
She received divine protection from Nüwa, and not even a hair on her head was
hurt. Thus, her innocence was confirmed for everyone to see. Another popular
legend states that Nüwa protected a high Communist leader by delivering a
thick fog when he was chased by Japanese invaders in the 1940s. The fog helped
hide him, and he escaped from his pursuers. Such legends illustrate belief in
Nüwa’s protection and provide strong support for the preservation and transmis
sion of Nüwa myths. Additionally, the fact that Nüwa myths are regularly re
peated during the temple fair serves to strengthen and broaden beliefs in
Nüwa.69
Similar to this situation occurring among Han people, many gods worshiped
by other ethnic groups also exist in myths. Myths often form the basic parts of be
liefs. For example, among Naxi people in Yongning County, Yunnan Province, a
great goddess named Heidi Ganmu is an important presence in myths as well as in
beliefs. She is believed to be the goddess who takes charge of population growth
and decline, controls the growth of crops, and rules the health and production of
livestock. Every lunar July 25, people offer sacrifices to this goddess. Another god
dess, Zihong Jiemei, is popularly said to be a goddess in heaven who later married
a man surviving a great flood, so she is considered to be the ancestress of humans
and is given sacrifices every October. In the Achang ethnic group in Yunnan
Introduction 49



Province, a myth mentions that a brother and sister married and created the sky
and heaven, and then produced humans. For this reason, they are worshiped as
two great gods and as the ancestors of the Achang people.
Influence of Myth on Literature and Art
Chinese myths have long been thought to be the root of Chinese literature and
art. Myths have had a great impact on writers. During the history of Chinese lit
erature, many eminent poets and writers, including Qu Yuan, Tao Yuanming
(365–427 CE), Li Bai (701–762), Li He (790–816), Wu Cheng’en (ca. 1500–ca. 1582),
Cao Xueqin (ca. 1715–1763), Lu Xun (1881–1936), and Guo Moruo (1892–1978),
were all more or less nourished by Chinese myths. Some of them directly took
myths as their writing material, and some further absorbed from myths stylistic
techniques such as exaggeration, fantasy, and fiction. By doing this, these literary
figures developed a strong romantic writing style in Chinese literature, which is
thought to originate from myths.

Myths were not fixed when they were woven into literature and art. In
stead, they were always rewritten and reconstructed by different writers for dif
ferent goals and needs. This revives old myths with new meanings in new con
texts. A popular animated TV series, The Legend of Nezha, provides a typical
example.
Until recently, animated cartoon films and TV series in China came mostly
from Japan and the United States (particularly Disney films). These programs
charmed numerous Chinese children and made them much addicted to these
cartoons. Adults in China began to worry about this and to call for Chinese
made animated movies and TV programs. In 2003 The Legend of Nezha was pro
duced and achieved great success. The series tells the story of how Nezha, a
naïve child with many shortcomings, is trained through a series of struggles
with many evils, and finally becomes a virtuous hero who weeds out evil and
helps people live in peace. Produced by CCTV (China Central Television), this
program aims to make a high-quality show full of Chinese tradition and values
while using the modern animation styles that children love to watch. The pro
ducers hope to make a nationally recognized art form to give Chinese children
an education about traditional Chinese stories and morals. The series combines

Changyi, The Classic of Mountains and Seas: Ancient Illustrations with Annotations, Shandong Huabao Chubanshe, 2001)



the traditional stories about Nezha with many other myths or legends. Several
famous Chinese mythological figures, such as Nüwa, Gonggong, Jingwei, and
Kuafu, were adapted. Their myths were changed for the purpose of propagating
values and morals for today’s Chinese children to learn and follow. The myth
that Kuafu pursued the sun is widely known and is used in the Nezha series. In
ancient records, the reason Kuafu pursued the sun is not very clear. Sometimes
it is said that he wanted to compete with the sun in a race to see who could run
the fastest. Before Kuafu reaches the sun, he dies of thirst. However, in the
Nezha series, Kuafu is said to be a leader of a Titan group and the representative
of justice and self-devotion. The evil goddess Shiji Niangniang tied up the crow
of the sun, the spirit of the sun, to a huge mountain so that the bird could not sit
down and the normal order of the universe was disturbed. To save people from
the disaster, Nezha asked for help from Kuafu, who at last defeated the wicked
spirit of the mountain. After this, in despair because of the evil power, the sun
bird wanted to fly to the far northern pole to sink itself into the dead sea, never
to rise again. To stop it from doing so and to rescue humans from eternal dark
ness, Kuafu chased the sun. He finally stopped the crow but was so tired that he
died. He was metamorphosed into a forest and continued to help people. Thus
the classical Kuafu myth has been rewritten for this TV series, retold in the con
text of speedy globalization in contemporary China, for the current purpose of
instructing children about Chinese heritage and spirit. In addition to its enter
tainment function, the Kuafu myth serves to help children to build values of jus
tice and the belief that justice will overcome evil in the end.
Influence of Myth on Daily Life
As a traditional genre that was primarily created in the ancient past and has
been transmitted for thousands of years, myth has deeply influenced people’s or
dinary lives throughout history. It often helps to shape people’s attitudes toward
the world, provides evidence and reasons for their behaviors, and supplies mean
ings and models for their current lives.
In some ethnic Chinese groups dog meat is thought to be a delicious and nu
tritious food. However, the Yao and She people usually are forbidden to eat it.
The origin of this custom is traced back to the Panhu myth. Panhu was a dog of
the divine sovereign, Di Ku. When Di Ku got into trouble during an invasion,
Panhu brought the enemy general’s head to Di Ku and thus helped him to win
the war. As a reward, Panhu received the emperor’s daughter as his wife. The
dog then carried the princess to the mountains of southern China, where they
had many children. Therefore, Panhu is worshiped as the ancestor of the Yao
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
52



and She ethnic groups. According to an ethnography written in 1980–1981 about
the Yao people of a village on Yao Mountain, Guangxi Province, Yao people wor
ship Panhu as their first ancestor and their protector. They honor him with the
title “King Pan.” As a result of this belief, Yao people cannot offend a dog in
their daily activities, and would not dare to eat dog meat. One of the ethnog
raphers mentions a story that has spread among villagers: a young man in the vil
lage told people that he had eaten dog
meat, and when his father heard this, as
a punishment, he fiercely knocked his
son’s head with his tobacco pipe. In the
Sanjiang and Baise districts, if any one
of the Yao people was found to have
eaten dog meat by mistake, he would be
made to butcher a pig and take a bath in
the pig’s blood, then offer the pig as a
sacrifice to King Pan.70 A similar taboo
against eating dog meat is prevalent
among the She people.71
In some other ethnic groups in the
south, such as the Miao, Zhuang, Tujia,
Buyi, Shui, Tibetan, Hani, and Gelao,
dogs do not have the benefit of the high
status of a remote ancestor, but they are
still commonly respected. This is at
tributed to the belief about the dog’s
contribution in helping humans obtain
the first precious grain seeds. A Tibetan
myth collected in Sichuan Province
states that in remote antiquity, grain
grew tall and produced plentiful seeds.
Humans lived easily and were rich. But
they did not treasure grain; instead,
some of them even used cakes as toilet
paper. The God of Heaven was very an
noyed at learning this, so he went down
to the earth to get back all the grain.
While doing so, a dog ran to him. It
grasped the bottom of the god’s trousers
and cried. The god was touched. He left
a small portion of seeds from each of

the different grains for the dog. Since the grains we have today were left on the
earth because of the dog, humans today should give part of their food to dogs.72 In
some other ethnic groups, people say that it was a dog that stole the grain seeds
from heaven and brought them to earth, which enables people today to make
their living by growing grains. A Miao myth states that in the ancient past, dogs
had nine tails. When a dog went to heaven to steal grain seeds, it was discovered
by the divine guards. In the process of escaping from the guards and running back
to the earth, eight of its tails were cut off. Fortunately, the dog brought back
some grain seeds that were stuck to its surviving tail. Because of this, when Miao
people celebrate the harvest festival, they feed their dogs first. In the Gelao and
Zhuang ethnicities, this type of myth also serves as an etiological myth to de
scribe the shape of a ripe grain plant. Grain plants are bushy, curled, and bent,
looking just like a dog’s tail.
Influence of Myth on the Chinese Spirit
Chinese scholars maintain that the rich body of Chinese myths is one of the
sources of Chinese civilization; myths impact Chinese people’s spirits in many
ways. Many myths in the Chinese language stress that strong effort is an essen
tial quality of the human spirit; when facing difficulty or calamity, one must
rely on his own ability and make every effort to change a bad situation rather
than passively obeying fate or God’s will. This theme can be found in the myths
that Gun and his son Yu restrained the flood, Nüwa melted five-colored stone
and repaired the broken sky, Yi shot down the extra nine suns when the world
was almost burned out, and others.
Flood is a worldwide mythical theme. It can be widely found in the myths
told by people of East and Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, the Indian Islands,
New Guinea, Polynesia, Micronesia, the Americas, and many other places. In
Chinese mythology it also appears quite often and shapes many types of stories.
Among the flood myths, the Gun-Yu myth is one of the most popular. The cul
ture hero Gun stole Xirang, the growing-soil, from the Supreme Divinity in
order to stop the flood. But he failed in his mission and was killed. His son Yu
was miraculously born from the belly of his corpse and continued to fight the
flood until he succeeded. The Gun-Yu myth stresses how the flood is eventually
controlled by great efforts from two generations.
Compared to the flood story in the Bible or other Western flood myths, the
Chinese flood myth is distinctive in some ways. The basic difference, as some
scholars have suggested, is that in the Chinese version what is emphasized is the
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
54



conquest of the flood and the origin
of civilization, rather than the flood
that occurred to punish human sin.73
This characteristic is strongly re
flected in the Gun-Yu myth. The
essence of this myth is not that one
should obey God’s will or the law of
nature, or wait for God’s plan. In
stead, the human spirit is praised for
counting on its own ability and vig
orously making every effort to con
quer the natural disaster. Eventually
the demigod Yu stopped the flood
and changed the dejected world into
a livable place for humankind. He
then became the founder of the first
civilized state, the Xia. His achieve
ments won him a high reputation in
literature, art, and beliefs. Today, he
still is frequently used as an exem
plary model to encourage people to
actively handle difficult situations
and to strive for a better life.
In Chinese mythology, another
trait of the human spirit that is
strongly emphasized in many sto
ries is toughness or unyieldingness. Some stories stress that one should strive
bravely and persistently, no matter how hard a task seems, even if it is impossi
ble to succeed. Myths related to this theme include the small bird Jingwei trying
to fill up the sea, the hero Kuafu chasing the sun, and Xingtian unflaggingly
fighting against the Supreme God after he was beheaded, by using his breasts as
his eyes and his navel as his mouth.
Jingwei was formally Yan Di’s (the Flame Emperor) daughter, named Nü Wa
(different from the great mother and cosmic repairer Nüwa). When Nü Wa was
playing in the Eastern Sea she was drowned and never returned. She metamor
phosed into a bird called Jingwei. Jingwei was determined to fill the sea, and day
after day it carried a pebble or a twig in its mouth and dropped it into the Eastern
Sea. It never questioned whether it was possible to fill up the vast sea with its tiny
efforts. Chinese people feel sympathetic toward Jingwei’s misfortune and admire
Introduction 55

the bird for its bravery, toughness, and patience. This myth has appeared in many
poems, novels, and operas, combining the diverse themes of pathos, courage, and
the refusal to accept defeat. “Jingwei Tries to Fill the Sea” has become an idiom,
which often is used to encourage people to learn from Jingwei’s spirit and to work
bravely and persistently no matter how hard the task.
Similarly, “Kuafu Chased the Sun” is also often used as an idiom. It usually
functions as a positive metaphor of human courage, toughness, and persistence.
Tao Yuanming, a renowned Jin poet, praised Kuafu in one of his poems:
Kuafu cherished a great ambition,
He then competed with the sun in a race.
At the same time they reached Yu Valley, where the sun set down,
It seemed neither of them won.
Because Kuafu possessed such divine power,
How could the water in the rivers be enough for him to drink, even if they
were drunk up?
His remains metamorphosed into the forest of peach trees,
And his merit was achieved after his death.
As in Tao’s poem, the Kuafu myth appears in many Chinese poems, novels,
operas, and cartoon films. Kuafu is usually praised as a tragic but great hero who
bravely challenges the difficult and impossible and intrepidly acts in order to re
alize his dream and ambition.

and the Classic of Regions beyond the Seas were written perhaps in the Warring States
era. He suggests that the Classic of Mountains was mostly written in the Warring States
era but that most of it was supplemented by people in the Qin and Han dynasties. He ar
gues that the last chapter of Regions within the Seas was written in the Qin and Han dy

wonder whether the first question relates to Nüwa, and if it relates to her they still don’t
know what it means.

22. For example, Chang Jincang argues that the mythological heroes, such as Gun,
Yu, and Yi, were heroes in ancient Chinese history. They were mythologized into
demigods during the Warring States era. See his “A Basic Question of Chinese Mythol
ogy: The Historicizing of Myth or the Mythologizing of History?” (in Chinese). Shaanxi
Shifan Daxue Xuebao 29, 3 (2000): 5–13. Another scholar, Liu Zongdi, insists that the
myth about ten suns living on a tree named Fusang in the eastern sea and being carried
by the three-legged crows is actually a historical fact in ancient China. The Fusang tree
was a sundial, and the ten suns around it were actually the motion of the sun. So, he
thinks, the myth was produced later by misinterpreting the real fact of the ancient calen
dar system. See his “Study on Shanhaijing from a New Perspective: Focus on the Rela
tionship between ‘The Classic of Regions beyond the Seas’; ‘The Classic of the Great
Wilderness’ and the Ancient Calendar System and Calendric Rites,” 33–34.
23. In his article, Bodde points out the problems that existed in ancient records of Chi
nese myth, and he criticizes the textual-analysis approach Chinese scholars adopted. Since
myths were recorded in fragments, and the texts were full of homophones and characters
easily confused with one another, Chinese scholars have committed themselves to seeking
new identifications. The identification was based on these arguments: character X of text A
seems to be character Y of text B; character Y seems to be character Z of text C; therefore,
they concluded that character X of text A was equal to character Z of text C. Bodde sug
gested that if this approach is excessively used, “it can lead to quite startling results.” See
“Myths of Ancient China.” In Mythologies in Ancient World, ed. Samuel Noah Kramer.

tual research, and she further suggests the advantages of utilizing orally transmitted myths
as the data. See her The Cult of Nüwa: Myths and Beliefs in China, 225–229.
24. As early as the 1920s, the eminent folklorist Zhong Jingwen gathered myths, leg
ends, and folktales and edited them into volumes. In the 1930s Zhong wrote several arti
cles about the living myths, the myths orally transmitted in modern China. He pointed
out that except for those myths that are recorded in ancient documents, most Chinese
myths are preserved in later literature and in living folk traditions through oral tellings of
myths in various contexts. Studying these living myths will greatly benefit the study of
sociology, folklore, religion, ethnic studies, and cultural anthropology. Instead of relying
on data from ancient written documents, Zhong used the living myths he collected or
that others collected from the oral tradition to study Panhu myths, flood myths, and the
myths of origins of plants. See Essays of Zhong Jingwen’s Studies on Folk Literature (in
Chinese), vol. 2. Shanghai: Shanghai Wenyi Chubanshe, 1985.
25. At that time the new government of the People’s Republic of China organized
many scholars and officials to investigate the society and history of Chinese ethnic
groups in order to understand their cultures, identify their ethnic distinctions, and bene
fit the government’s administration of these areas. The investigation of ethnic groups
was widely carried out throughout the country, with researchers collecting and compil
ing a large amount of data about the cultures and histories of Chinese minorities. These
data include population, language, economy, social organization, political system, folk
custom, trade, communication, and many others. Among them were living myths col
lected from the oral traditions of these people. Unfortunately, these rich collections have
seldom been seriously used to study Chinese myth until recently.

those people who have rich knowledge and are willing to tell myths “creative bearers of
myth tradition,” while those people who preserve less mythological knowledge, can only
tell myths in incomplete forms, and are reluctant to tell myths are “passive bearers of
myth tradition.” For an example of the argument about the active and passive bearers of

A TIMELINE OF THE
MYTHOLOGICAL WORLD
It is impossible to portray a clear chronology of Chinese mythology because
Chinese myths are never worked into an integrated and orderly system. Rather,
myths come from different cultural traditions and appear at different times, and
these myths are scattered throughout diverse sources. Additionally, the relation
ships between mythological events and particular gods are usually unfixed and
sometimes random. However, if we ignore for a moment these confusing facts
and look at the mythological events that happen in these narratives, we can con
struct a linear timeline of the mythological world according to the content of
the myths.
THE EMERGENCE OF GODS
The existence of gods usually is the prerequisite of any other facet of myth. In
myths recorded and told in Chinese, there are numerous gods and spirits who
take charge of various duties, such as arranging all the parts of heaven and earth,
creating water and fire, ordering the directions and seasons, and arranging the
underworld. Tian Di (the Supreme Heaven or the God of Heaven) or Shang Di
(the Supreme God or the Supreme Divinity) sometimes assumes the position as
the highest leader of the random pantheon of the gods. During the Tang or Song
dynasty, the disorderly pantheon became systemized and Yu Di, the Jade Em
peror who came into being when Taoism and beliefs of the Supreme God were
merged together, turned out to be the supreme ruler of the comparatively or
dered pantheon of gods.
Some Chinese myths (including myths in Han and other ethnic groups) do
not explain where the gods and culture heroes come from and how they come
into being: gods already exist when the cosmic creation begins. But some myths
do explain their origins, which are rather diverse. Gods and heroes may be born
by a divine father and mother, come from an egg or other object, be created from
63
2



air or sound, come from another god’s corpse, be made by other deities with
mud, or may be transformed from a monkey. Among these possible birth stories
of gods, the most popular ones in the Chinese language are those of the creator
Pangu coming from an egg and the “Gansheng myths” (in which gan means “re
sponding with or reacting to an outside influence” and sheng means “birth”).
Pangu Was Born from the Cosmic Egg
Pangu often appears as the creator of the world, the first god who was born from
the cosmic egg. In some versions, he is said to be born from the primeval chaotic
formlessness, the contents of which were much like a chicken’s egg. He grew up
in the egg while shaping heaven and earth. Each day heaven rose ten feet higher,
the earth grew ten feet thicker, and Pangu grew ten feet taller. This situation
lasted for 18,000 years. By then heaven was extremely high, the earth was ex
tremely deep, and Pangu was extremely tall. Since he had to twist his body in
this egg, he got his name Pangu (pan means “coil up”; gu means “antiquity”).
The Gansheng Myths
In Chinese mythology, considerable gods, demigods, and heroes are described as
having been born after their mothers experienced a miraculous phenomenon:
they became pregnant without having sexual intercourse with men. Instead,
these women became pregnant because they swallowed an egg, were exposed to
the sunshine in a special way, drank divine water, swallowed mythical pearls,
consumed certain plants (such as red hawthorn or Job’s tears), dreamed of devour
ing the suns, responded to a divine animal (a dragon, for example), touched a
piece of wood, or reacted to the air, and so forth. Chinese scholars classify these
kinds of myths as “Gansheng myths,” in which the gods’ mothers miraculously
became pregnant after they responded to certain outside influences and inci
dents, which may refer to animals, plants, or astronomical phenomena. In myths
in the Chinese language, many important gods, heroes, and divine ancestors
boast such Gansheng myths. For example, Fuxi was said to be born after his
mother trod in a huge footprint in a marshland and then became pregnant; Huang
Di was born after his mother saw a great bolt of lightning one night circling one
of the stars in the Great Bear and then became miraculously pregnant; Shennong
or the Divine Farmer’s mother got pregnant because she was touched by a divine
dragon; the sage king Shun was born after his mother saw a great rainbow; the
great hero Yu was born after his mother consumed Job’s tears (another version
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
64



says he came out from his father’s belly); the founder of the Shang people, Qi, was
miraculously born after his mother ingested a swallow’s egg and became preg
nant; Houji, the founder of the Zhou people, was born after his mother stepped
into a huge footprint in the field. These myths usually function as certifications
of these gods’ sacred origins and their extraordinary powers and capabilities.
THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNIVERSE
Similar to the existence of gods usually being the prerequisite of any other
mythical emergence, the presence of the universe often functions as the founda
tion for human existence and culture’s invention. But sometimes a Chinese
myth may start without mentioning the creation of the universe. Many myths
begin with the universe already in existence. Among the various myths in Chi
nese about the emergence of the universe, the following types and motifs are the
most well-known.
The Cosmos Came from an Egg
This type of myth is told in relation to the creator Pangu. It posits that at the be
ginning of time, heaven and earth were in chaotic formlessness like a chicken’s
egg. Pangu was born within this chaos. After 18,000 years, the egg somehow
opened and unfolded. The limpid and light part of it rose and became heaven,
and the turbid and heavy part of it sank down and became the earth. In some
other versions orally transmitted in contemporary China, the description of the
cosmos emerging from an egg is shown more clearly. A myth version collected
in Zhejiang Province maintains that Pangu could not bear to be confined to the
darkness and stuffiness in the cosmic egg, so he shattered the egg into pieces.
The egg white was light so it became heaven whereas the yolk was heavy so it
became the earth. The broken shell of it was mixed into the white and the yolk.
Two bigger pieces of the shell became the sun and the moon, and the numerous
smaller pieces mixed into the white to become the stars. In contrast, those
pieces mixed into the yolk became stones.
The Universe Came from a Divine Corpse
This type of myth can be found among many ethnic groups. In myths in Chi
nese, the most famous one also connects to Pangu. According to many versions
A Timeline of the Mythological World 65



of the Pangu myth, when Pangu was dying, his body began to transform. His
breath became the winds and clouds, his voice became the thunder, his left eye
became the sun, his right eye became the moon, his four limbs and trunk be
came the four extremes of the earth and the Five Mountains, his blood became
the rivers, his veins became the earth’s arteries, his flesh became fields and soil,
his hair and beard became the stars, his skin and body hair became plants, his
teeth and bones became various metals and rocks, his semen and marrow be
came pearls and jade, his sweat became the rain and the dew, and the various in
sects on his body reacted to the wind and turned into human beings.
Parents of the Suns and the Moons
In myths in the Chinese language, it is well-known that the sun(s) and the
moon(s) are born by their parents. The divine father is commonly said to be Di
Jun, or Emperor Jun, one of the supreme gods in ancient time. The mothers are
Di Jun’s two consorts, Xihe and Changxi. Xihe gives birth to ten suns. The suns
live on the Fusang tree. When one sun finishes its work and comes back home,
another sun will go out in its place. Xihe often bathed the suns in the Gan Gulf
beyond the East Sea. Changxi is the mother of the twelve moons. She bathed the
moons at Mount Riyue (Mount Sun and Moon).
The Separation of Heaven and the Earth
The motif of separating heaven from the earth is quite popular in Chinese
mythology. A cluster of myths affirms that at the very beginning of time,
heaven and the earth were tightly linked with each other, or there was only a
narrow crack between them. Then, by some means they were separated from
each other and remained apart through today. Widely spread by people in the
ethnic groups of Han, Miao, Yao, Yi, Naxi, Buyi, Dulong, Paiwan (in Taiwan),
and others, these myths are quite varied in the ways that they account for the
reasons for separations and the means by which this separation occurred (see the
entry “Li”). Among these various myths, a prominent one in ancient Chinese
writings is the myth that Zhong and Li broke off the connection between
heaven and the earth. Chiyou started a revolt and brought disaster to the com
mon people. Influenced by him, people on the earth gradually became corrupt.
They began to cheat, steal, disobey their faith, and violate the oath between
them and the Supreme Divinity. Many innocent people brought complaints
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
66



against them to the Supreme Divinity. The Supreme Divinity thus ordered two
of his subordinates, the deities Zhong and Li, to cut off the link between heaven
and the earth. From then on, people could never ascend to heaven again, and,
correspondingly, the deities could never descend to the earth either.
THE EMERGENCE OF HUMANS
Numerous mythological types and themes explain the origins of humans in
Chinese mythology. Among them are that humans were made by gods; that
they were sown from seeds; that they were spat out from the mouths of gods
and goddesses; that they were made from sound; that they were created by two
gods touching their knees together; that they came from an animal’s metamor
phosis; that a plant metamorphosed into the first human; that humans came out
of a cave or emerged from a huge stone or a gourd; that they were procreated by

animals or plants; that they were born after a man married a goddess, or after a
man married an animal; that they were created by the sun; and that they were
made from the corpse of a divine creature (see the Introduction to this book for
more detail). Among these myths, the most celebrated in the Chinese language
are as follows.
Humans Were Created by Nüwa Molding Mud
Among the Han people, the most popular story explaining the origin of humans
relates to the goddess Nüwa. It holds that when heaven and the earth had been
created, no humans yet existed. So Nüwa created human beings by molding
them from yellow earth with her hands. The work drained her strength and took
a lot of time, so after she had molded many humans she took a cord and pulled it
through the mud, then lifted the cord and shook it. All of the sludge that fell
down from the cord became men and women. One version of the myth explains
that rich and noble people were those made by Nüwa’s hands whereas poor and
lowly people were those made by Nüwa dragging a cord through the mud.
Humans Were Re-created by the Brother-Sister Couple
Another widely spread type of myth explaining the origin of today’s humans
maintains that they were re-created by a sibling couple after their elder genera
tions were annihilated in a big disaster. In China, this brother-sister marriage
myth can be found in more than forty ethnic groups, including the Han (see the
Introduction). This myth basically states that in remote antiquity, there was a
great disaster (flood, fire mixed with oil, uncommon snow, etc.). All humans in
the world were destroyed except for a brother and his sister. They wanted to
marry each other in order to repopulate the earth but wondered whether this
was proper. They agreed that if certain things happened in a test, they should get
married. The test in some myth versions was to roll two pieces of a millstone
down different sides of a mountain. If the stones touched at the bottom of the
mountain, the siblings should marry. In other versions the brother and sister
each lit a fire from a different place, and if the two lines of smoke joined each
other instead of dispersing, they should marry. Usually these things all hap
pened perfectly, so the two got married. After their marriage, some myths state
that the sister gave birth to normal children. Others state that she gave birth to
an abnormal fetus (such as a spherical piece of flesh, a gourd, a knife stone, and
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
68



so on). In these myths Nüwa opens the abnormal fetus or cuts it into pieces, and
new humans emerge (see the entry “Nüwa”).
THE INVENTION OF CULTURE
China boasts abundant myths about culture heroes and their inventions. These
inventions refer to the ordering of human life; acquisition of a livable environ
ment; acquisition of a food supply for humans; creation of crafts, arts, and wis
dom; establishment of customs and laws; and so on. In an ancient text in Shi Ben
(The Origin of Hereditary Families, ca. third century BC), many such initial in
ventions made by gods, goddesses, and heroes were recorded. This text states that
Fuxi invented the qin (a seven-stringed plucked instrument); Shennong invented
the se (a twenty-five-stringed plucked instrument, similar to the zither); Nüwa
invented the shenghuang (a reed-pipe wind instrument); Zhuanxu ordered Fei
longshi (literally meaning “flying dragon”) to make a large bell, whose sound
could shock people and reach far distances; Zhurong invented the market;
Goumang invented the luo (a net for catching birds); Huang Di asked Xihe to

make the divination for the sun and Changyi to make the divination for the
moon; Linglun invented music; Juyong and Cangjie made Chinese characters;
Shihuang invented drawing; Boyu created cloth; Yinshou invented the mirror;
Chiyou used metal to make weapons; Sorcerer Xian invented divination; Sorcerer
Peng invented medicine; Sorcerer Xian (it is still disputed whether these two Sor
cerers Xian are the same person) made the brass drum; Fengmeng invented shoot
ing; Hai domesticated the cow and invented the oxcart; Xiangtu invented the
horse-drawn carriage; Xizhong invented the cart; Susha first made salt by evapo
ration; Boyi invented the well; Yao invented the game of Go; Gun invented city
walls; Gaotao invented the five chief forms of punishment in ancient China;
Shun made the xiao (a vertical bamboo flute); Kui invented music; Keshou in
vented painting; Kunwu invented pottery; and so forth.
Among these numerous myths about the cultural inventions recorded in
Chinese, the most prominent and characteristic ones are the stories relating to
the inventions of agriculture, fire, Chinese characters, Chinese medicine, and
musical instruments.
Inventing Agriculture
The myths concerning agricultural invention mainly tell how gods of agricul
ture, such as Houji (“Lord Millet” or “Sovereign Millet”), Shennong (the Divine
Farmer), Houtu (the Divine Earth), and Shujun, started the technologies of sow
ing and cultivating, and invented a variety of farm tools. The most famed inven
tions of agriculture are attributed to Shennong. He is said to have first taught
people to sow the five grains (different names are given in different explanations;
they sometimes refer to rice, two kinds of millet, wheat, and beans), to examine
the land, and to cultivate it according to the land’s quality (dry or wet, fertile or
barren, high or low, etc.). He rescued people from consuming plants and worms,
and from drinking from rivers. In some versions he is said to have tasted the
fruits of hundreds of plants and grasses, and recognized their sour or bitter fla
vors. After this process, he then taught people to take the five grains as their
food. Additionally, Shennong is said to have invented numerous important farm
tools such as the axe, hoe, and leisi, a plowlike farm tool used in ancient China.
He cut wood to make the plowshare, and bent a piece of wood to make the han
dle of the plow. In the process of using these tools, he taught people to open up
wastelands and hoe weeds. He also taught people to excavate wells and irrigate
land. He invented the way of storing grain seeds. He also invented the calendar
and Jieqi, which divided the solar year into twenty-four seasonal divisions
(“twenty-four Jieqi”) indicating the change of climate and timing for agricultural

70



activities. Because of his great contributions to agriculture, he was respectfully
addressed as “the Divine Farmer.”
Acquisition of Fire
The most distinguished myth explaining the origin of fire in the mythological
world of Chinese language is the myth about Suirenshi (in which sui literally
means “flint,” ren means “human,” and shi here is a respectful address for an
cient heroes), the producer of fire in remote antiquity. In a popular version he is
said to be inspired by a bird that was pecking a huge tree named Sui, producing a
lot of sparks. Imitating it, Suirenshi used a small branch of wood to drill into the
tree and produced lots of sparks. That started the practice of making and using
fire. From then on, humans began to cook food and thus differed from animals.
Discovery of Chinese Medicine
As one of the great contributions that Chinese people have made to the world,
the theories of Chinese medicine claim that the human body is an integral
whole and that each part of it is intimately connected and interacts with other
parts. Furthermore, the human body is closely connected to nature. Disease is
caused because of the internal imbalance of Yin and Yang (the two opposing
principles in nature; the former represents the feminine and negative principle
whereas the latter represents the masculine and positive) and therefore can be
treated by balancing the two elements in the body through the use of herbal
medicine, acupuncture, and moxibustion, and in other ways. Today many Chi
nese people believe that Chinese medicine can fundamentally put the body into
a healthy and harmonious state whereas Western medicine only cures the super
ficial disease instead of the root cause of that disease.
The most eminent myth about the discovery of Chinese medicine relates
to Shennong’s contribution. Shennong is popularly said to have tasted, or in
some other versions, thrashed with a magic reddish-brown whip, hundreds of
herbs in order to figure out their medicinal characteristics and functions. Then
he completely knew their flavors and properties of coldness, warmness, mild
ness, or toxicity, and thereafter used them to cure people’s diseases. This work
was sometimes dangerous. He once consumed seventy poisonous plants in one
day. Sometimes Shennong is described not only as the primogenitor of Chinese
traditional medicine but also as a general practitioner of medicine. He is de
picted as the first to carefully study the pulse conditions, discern the different
A Timeline of the Mythological World 71



characteristics of medicines, and start the therapies of acupuncture and moxi
bustion. Shennong also wrote a medical book.
Inventing Chinese Characters
Chinese characters form the oldest writing system still most popularly used
today. Compared to the phonetic systems of the West, Chinese characters may
look more complex. There are four main parts of their composition, which are
pictographs, simple ideographs, compound ideographs, and phonetic ideographs.
The pictographic words make up the most basic part of the writing system, and
the characters of the phonetic ideographs form about 90 percent of the system.
Myths explaining the mythological invention of Chinese characters are also
quite famous. It is widely said that a cultural hero named Cangjie invented the
Chinese character. Cangjie had four eyes and had the ability to write when he
was born. He examined the constellations, observed the footprints of birds and
beasts, and studied the signs visible on turtles’ shells and on birds’ feathers, on
mountains and rivers, and on fingers and palms. From these observations he un
derstood that natural phenomena could be differentiated and marked by picto
graphic signs. Relying on these signs, he created Chinese characters. This inven
tion was such a great event that afterward the millet fell down like rain from
heaven, and ghosts cried during the night.
Inventing Musical Instruments
In ancient China, especially in the Confucianism theory, music played an im
portant role in philosophy, education, ethics, and politics. Besides its function as
entertainment, it was also believed to be able to help improve people’s tempera
ment and cultivate their morals. Therefore, music was believed to help achieve
the larger goal of producing a harmonious and civilized society. For this reason,
musical training was usually taken as a necessary part of an intellectual’s ac
complishments. A talented intellectual often received compliments for his mas
tery of the qin, Chinese chess, calligraphy, and painting.
Corresponding with the important role of music in ancient Chinese culture,
abundant myths in Chinese explain the origins of music, various musical instru
ments, and even some sacred melodies or songs composed by gods. Almost
every superior god and goddess is said to have contributed something in this
area. For example, it is said that Nüwa invented the shenghuang and the xiao to
entertain the humans she created. Fuxi made the se and the xun (an egg-shaped
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
72



clay wind instrument with finger holes) and composed the melody of “Jiabian.”
The divine farmer, Shennong, in some myth versions is also depicted to have in
vented important ancient Chinese musical instruments such as the qin and the
se. He made them to help people to be calm, to keep their childlike innocence
instead of being evil. He also composed a piece of music named “Fuchi” or “Xi
amou.” Among these myths about the invention of music, Linglun and his cre
ations are the most famous. Linglun was the governor of music under Huang Di.
He was ordered to establish music. So he went to the west of Daxia Marsh, and
to the north of Ruanyu Mountain, and located a kind of bamboo from the Xiexi
Valley. He made a pipe from it, the sound of which created the base of ancient
Chinese musical modes. He then made twelve bamboo pipes and blew them by
imitating the phoenix’s singing. And that made up the twelve lü (a series of stan
dard bamboo pitch pipes used in ancient music). In this way, he invented the
five notes of the ancient Chinese five-tone scale (gong, shang, jiao, zhi, and yu,
equivalent to 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 in numbered musical notation or do, re, mi, so, and
la in Western solfeggio) and the eight sounds made by eight musical instru
ments, like the xun, sheng (a pipe wind instrument made of gourd), drum, bam
boo pipe, strings, qing (an ancient percussion instrument made from jade or
stone), bell, and zhu (an ancient percussion instrument made from wood). Be
cause of his great contribution to music, Linglun is respected in later tradition
as the God of Music and the divine ancestor of actors. Because of him, musicians
and actors are generally called linglun or lingren (ren means “human”).
COSMIC DISASTERS AND RESTORATIONS
In Chinese mythology, myths about world calamities in the remote past are
quite numerous. They tell how and why the former world or human race was
disturbed or even destroyed during the catastrophes, which usually happened in
the form of deluge, worldwide fire, rare snow, the collapse of the sky pillars,
more than one sun rising in heaven, and so forth. Among some ethnic groups,
the mythological world catastrophes occurred in a series and regularly. After the
disasters, the stories usually continued with renewal of the world and humans.
In myths relayed in Chinese, the most prominent concerning cosmic disasters
and their restorations are myths about Gun and Yu controlling the flood, the
brother-sister couple re-creating humans after the world deluge, Nüwa repairing
the broken sky, and Yi shooting down the surplus nine suns. Since the myth
about the sibling couple who became human ancestors was introduced earlier,
here the other three are presented.
A Timeline of the Mythological World 73



The Flood and Its Control
Flood myths are especially popular in Chinese mythology. Chinese flood myths
usually tell how the flood imperiled the world in ancient times, and therefore
how heroes or heroines tried to stop the flood and save the world from the disas
ter, or how human ancestors tried to re-create humans after the deluge, and how
a new cosmic order was eventually rebuilt and a new civilization appeared.
Some Chinese scholars assert that there are three systems of flood myths in
Chinese mythology (see the entry “the Floods”). Among them, the Gun-Yu
myth is the most popular one, focusing on the theme of flood and the control
ling of it. Most versions of this myth state that in the ancient era, the flood
brought great damage to the world. The water was so fierce that it gushed up
into heaven. Gun wanted to stop the flood. So he stole Xirang, a kind of mythi
cal soil that was able to grow ceaselessly by itself, from the Supreme Divinity
without waiting for his permission. Gun used Xirang to barricade against the
overflowing water. The Supreme Divinity was angry, so he ordered the fire god
Zhurong to kill Gun at the outer edge of Yushan (which literally means “feather
mountain”). Gun’s corpse did not rot for three years. Later, when his belly was
opened with a sword, his son Yu emerged. Yu continued to fight the floodwater.
He deepened the seas and lakes, dredged the rivers, and dug mountains, channel
ing the overflowing water to the east seas. Eventually the demigod Yu stopped
the flood and changed the miserable world into a habitable place for humankind.
He then became the founder of the first civilized state, Xia. According to a wide
spread mythological story, Yu spent thirteen years trying to control the deluge.
During this period, he was so devoted to his task that he did not go to his home
three times when he passed by it. In another story, he had changed into a bear to
dig a mountain when his pregnant wife came to bring him food. She felt embar
rassed when she saw her husband as a bear, so she ran away. Yu ran after her and
she metamorphosed into a stone. When Yu shouted to the stone, “Give back my
son!” the stone opened up and out came Qi (literally meaning “open up”), the
first ruler of Xia.
The Repair of the Broken Sky
Though the notable myth about Nüwa mending the broken sky is sometimes at
tributed to flood myth systems (see the entry “the Floods”), the disaster it de
scribes is actually not only a flood. Rather, it is a cosmic catastrophe. In some ver
sions, this calamity was caused by the collapse of the four poles supporting
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
74



heaven. In other texts, this cosmic disorder was caused by the breakdown of one
of the sky poles, Mount Buzhou (literally means “not full”), in a war between the
gods Gonggong and Zhuanxu (names differ in different texts). Gonggong fought
with Zhuanxu to be the supreme god but failed in the war. He was so angry that
he butted into Mount Buzhou. The collapse of the sky pillar(s) caused great disas
ters. Fires raged fiercely and could not be extinguished. Water flowed without
abating. Ferocious birds and beasts seized and devoured people. At this moment,
the goddess Nüwa melted stones of five different colors to patch heaven, and cut
the legs off of a huge tortoise and set them up to support the four extremities of
heaven. She defeated the fierce Black Dragon to save the people, and collected
ashes of reeds to stop the flood. Her arduous work cleared up the terrible mess
and put the world in order again. In some versions collected in the twentieth cen
tury, Nüwa not only mended the broken sky but also repaired the broken earth
that was damaged in the same disas
ter. Her mythical actions often serve
as an etiology to explain why people
today can see colorful clouds in
heaven (because the goddess mended
heaven with colorful stones), and
why the current western land of
China is high while the east is low
(she used the longer legs of the tor
toise to support the west, using the
shorter legs to support the east).
Shooting Down the Surplus Suns
Another famous cosmic disaster and
its restoration in Chinese mythol
ogy relate to shooting down the sur
plus suns. This type of myth can be
found in many ethnic groups, such
as the Han, Hani, Lahu, Luoba, Lisu,
Naxi, Qiang, Tujia, Miao, Yao,
Dong, Yi, Zhuang, Li, Buyi, Gelao,
Mongol, Hezhe, and others. It usu
ally tells that in ancient ages, there

were several suns appearing in heaven (the number of the suns may be seven, ten,
twelve, or another number). The weather became extremely hot, the earth was
burned, and the crops all died. Humans suffered greatly from the disaster. Then a
hero arrived. He shot down the surplus suns and left only one for the normal use
of this world. In this way, he restored the cosmos to regular order.
In myths in the Chinese language, the hero who shot down the extra suns is
Yi. He is often set in the time of the sage ruler Yao. Many versions of his myths
describe that at the time of Yao, ten suns rose up together in heaven. They
burned crops and dried the grasses and woods, and this resulted in the deaths of
many humans. In addition, ferocious monsters took this opportunity to devour
the remaining humans. So Yi shot down the additional nine suns and left one for
the natural cosmic order. Thus the cosmos was renewed again.
CIRCULAR TIME
A rudimentary look at the mythological events listed above may give one an im
pression that the timeline of Chinese myths is linear. However, a distinguished
mythologist, Wang Xiaoliang, who works at a university in Japan, suggests that
the timeline in some Chinese myths, such as Nüwa repairing the broken sky
and the sibling couple reproducing humans after the flood, is circular. It is differ
ent from the linear timeline in Christian mythology. He names this cluster of
myths “Circularly Returning to the Original Order.” He finds the basic plot
structure to be like this: (1) there was a mythical paradise (the original cosmic
order); (2) the original paradise was broken (because of humans’ rebellion against
gods, wars between gods, or the world deluge); (3) the paradise was reconstructed
(resumed the initial state, or returned to the original order). Wang points out
that the circular timeline in these myths shows the conception that “time is cir
cular,” held by many people in ancient times, including the Chinese. These peo
ple believed that nature and human life all experienced a circular life cycle, just
like the sun rises in the morning, sets down in the evening, and rises up again in
the next morning (Wang 1987, 565–572). This circular conception of time deeply
influenced many famous Chinese classic novels, such as Sanguoyanyi (Ro
mance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong, 1328?–1398?), Shuihuzhuan
(The Water Margin by Shi Nai’an, ca. fourteenth century CE), and Hongloumeng
(Dream of the Red Chamber, written by Cao Xueqin, 1715–1763). In these nov
els, the protagonist(s) all experience an initial order (sacred and orderly time),
then go through disasters and adversities in the secular world (the original order
is destroyed), and, in the end, return back to the original order again (back to the
sacred and orderly time) (Wang 1987, 573–578). Though his argument needs fur

ther discussion, it provides an inspiring perspective to understand the complex
ity of the timeline of Chinese mythology.

DEITIES, THEMES, AND CONCEPTS
BA
Ba is the drought deity, the daughter of Huang Di, the Yellow Emperor. She can
bring severe drought to the world by withholding water and rain. She is also
called Nüba or Hanba (nü means “female” and han means “drought”).
Ba is one of the most ancient goddesses in the written tradition, because her
name and function are mentioned in Shijing (The Classic of Poetry, compiled in
or before 500 BC), though this mention is rather simple and concise.
Ba’s main function is described with more detail in Shanhaijing. She is said
to be the daughter of Huang Di and lived on the Terrace of Gonggong, which is
located on Xikun Mountain in the north. She was bald and dressed in green.
Wherever she lived there always was a drought. When Chiyou attacked Huang
Di, he asked Feng Bo (the Wind God) and Yu Shi (the Rain Master) to release a
storm. But Huang Di asked Ba to descend from heaven and help him. The rain
stopped at once, so Huang Di won the battle and then executed Chiyou. Though
Ba made great contributions in the battle, somehow she could not return to
heaven after the battle. Wherever she stayed there was a drought. Eventually
Shujun, the Cultivation God, complained about this to Huang Di. Later the em
peror instructed Ba to live north of the Red River. But Ba was unwilling to be
confined; she often fled this area and wandered to other places, bringing drought
with her. Therefore, if people wanted to receive rain, they needed to drive her
away. The way they usually did this was to dredge the canals in advance, and
then pray to her, “Goddess, go north to where you should stay!” It is said that it
would rain after Ba was driven away (chapter 17 of Shanhaijing).
The image and character of Ba, as well as the custom of “driving Ba away,”
were also described in Shenyijing (The Classic of Spirits and Strange Things,
which is said to have been written in the Han period, but probably was written
in the Six Dynasties era, 386–589 CE). Ba was reportedly two or three chi (three
chi equals one meter, or 3.3 feet) in height, with two eyes on her head, and she
wore no clothes. She looked like a human and walked fast like the wind. Where
79
3



she appeared, there was a drought. But if she was captured and plunged into ex
crement, the drought would be stopped.
The custom of “driving Ba away” was common in numerous variations be
fore 1949 in some regions of Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, and other provinces. In
the northern part of Henan Province, for instance, Ba was thought to be the
corpse of a newly buried person. If it did not rain for a long time, the anxious
farmers would open the new grave with fresh earth on top, dig the corpse out,
and whip it, because they believed Ba would water the grave during the night.
They called this “beating Drought Ba.” They believed it would rain soon after
this rite. However, in Sichuan Province in southwest China the ritual was quite
different. One man would disguise himself as the Drought Ba and four men
would act as warriors. Ba would escape here and there, and the warriors would
run after “her” while the audience helped them by shouting or beating the
drums. The ritual would last for several hours until Ba was driven away from
this area.

BOYI
Domesticator of beasts and birds, and a capable help to the hero Yu in control
ling the great flood and taming all kinds of animals in the world, Boyi also ap
pears as Yi (different from the hero Yi who shoots down the surplus suns) in dif
ferent myth versions.
As the helper and minister of Yu, Boyi made many glorious contributions to
the king and to ordinary people. One of his most famous deeds is helping Yu to
prevent frequent floods through water control. This skill is often related to his
mythical ability to tame beasts and birds. Boyi could understand the language
and characteristics of animals, which enabled him to domesticate some beasts
and birds and keep them from hurting human beings. Another of his important
deeds is that he invented the digging of wells, one of the most vital facilities in
people’s lives in early times. According to some versions, because of Boyi’s dis
tinguished merits, King Yu abdicated in favor of Boyi, handing the crown over to
him. But Yu’s son, Qi, killed Boyi, took over as the king, and became the first
ruler of Xia, the first civilized state in Chinese history.

BUZHOU, MOUNT
A famous sky pillar, one of the mythical mountains holding up heaven; Mount
Buzhou was damaged by Gonggong in a war and was partially destroyed, hence
its name (bu means “not” or “without,”and zhou means “complete” or “full”).
The concept that heaven is supported by pillars or some other kind of foun
dation is found in many cultures. In China, this cosmological belief is also quite
common among many ethnic groups. The sky holders can be big mountain
peaks, huge trees, turtles’ feet, deities’ or heroes’ bodies or corpses, pillars of gold
or silver, or other supports. The number of the holders may be four, five, eight, or
even twelve, due to variations from different ethnicities, times, and places.
Among these supports holding up heaven, Mount Buzhou is very famous. It
is located at the corner of the great wilderness beyond the northwest seas. To
the north it overlooks Mount Zhubi and Mount Yuechong, and to the east it
overlooks the Youze Marsh, where the river runs underground and its roaring
noise can be heard on the plain. Two yellow beasts guard Mount Buzhou. A
mythical fruit that looks like a peach but has leaves like a jujube, with blossoms
of yellow with calyx red, grows there. If one eats the fruit, one will no longer feel
tired or, in one version of the myth, will not feel hungry any longer.
The most well-known myth about Mount Buzhou is that it was damaged by
the water god Gonggong in his war with Zhuanxu, sometimes called Zhurong or
Shennong (different names are given in different texts). This story was men
tioned as early as in the late Warring States era in “Tianwen,” which, similar to
its other mythological recordings, put a simple and ambiguous question on the
logical connection between Gonggong’s rage and the tilt of the earth toward the
southeast.
A much more detailed story appeared later in Huainanzi and Lunheng. De
tailed accounts also exist in other written works, but with considerable variants.
Huainanzi (chapter 3) states that Gonggong fought with Zhuanxu to be
ruler in remote antiquity. In his fury he bumped against Mount Buzhou and
caused this pillar of heaven to break and snap the cords of the earth. Since then,
heaven tilts toward the northwest, and that is why the sun, moon, and stars con
tinue to this day to move in that direction. The earth also had a piece missing in
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 81



the southeast, and that is why the rivers of China flow toward the ocean in the
east.
The same story was told in Lunheng, but it is connected to the Nüwa myth
of repairing the broken sky. In this version Gonggong butted against Mount
Buzhou in his unsuccessful war with Zhuanxu, thereby causing the pillar of the
sky and the cords of the earth to break. It was then that Nüwa patched up the
sky with melted colorful stones and cut off a turtle’s feet to hold it up. A similar
explanation was given for the variations in the Chinese topography.
In Liezi (which was thought to have been written in the Warring States era
but probably was compiled during the Jin dynasty, 265–420 CE), though the two
stories also are connected, their chronological order is opposite. Nüwa patched
the broken sky first because it was defective, followed by Gonggong’s damage
years later.
Now more and more scholars argue that this story, “Gonggong bumps into
Mount Buzhou,” has no logical connection with the story that “Nüwa repaired
the broken sky.” They are loosely bound together with their development and
change. Similar mergers of separate stories can be commonly found in Chinese
oral tradition, including Chinese mythology.
No matter whom Gonggong fought with, and no matter whether the Gong
gong event happened before Nüwa’s repair or afterward, Mount Buzhou was
damaged by Gonggong, and thereafter a new cosmological order was established.

CANCONG
Cancong was the founder of the ancient Shu kingdom (modern Sichuan Province
in southwest China) in mythical history, the first ancestor of Shu kings, and a
mythological hero who taught the techniques of sericulture (silk production) to
humans in local mythology. In his name, can means “silkworm” and cong
means “cluster,” which illustrates his strong affinity with sericulture.
The Cancong myth is very scattered and faint in Chinese mythological
records, and therefore, we can draw only an outline of this myth from fragmen
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
82



tal texts in some ancient Chinese literature. Cancong appeared as the first an
cestor of Shu kings. His descendants were the kings Baihu and Yufu. During
these three reigns the population was sparse and people did not practice writing,
ritual, and music. Each of these three kings lived for several hundreds of years,
and the people who followed them vanished. Like many other mythological an
cestors and gods, Cancong also had an unusual appearance in that his eyes
bulged in an upright position, which showed his extraordinary powers. He al
ways wore green clothes, thus he was also called “Green God” or “God in Green
Clothes.” Yuan Ke, an important Chinese mythologist, deduced that the origi
nal figure of this god of sericulture is a silkworm, because the color of the silk
worm is green (Yuan 1993, 367).
The most important deed Cancong did, according to the mythological
record, is teaching people how to rear silkworms. According to Xianzhuan Shiyi
(Supplementary Material to “Biographies of Immortals” and to “Biographies of
Holy Immortals,” written in the late Tang dynasty, ca. tenth century CE, now
known only in later writings that quote this work) and Sanjiao Soushen Daquan
(A Compendium of Information on the Gods of the Three Religions, written in
the Yuan dynasty, 1206–1368 CE), Cancong set himself up as king of Shu and
taught people to breed silkworms. He made thousands of golden silkworms and
gave every family one golden silkworm at the beginning of every year. The silk
worms in each family multiplied prolifically, and after some time people would
return the golden silkworms to their king. When Cancong toured the area of his
realm to make an inspection, wherever he stopped, people would gather and
form silkworm markets. Because people received great benefits from Cancong,
they built many temples throughout western China to worship and offer sacri
fices to him.
During the twentieth century, especially in 1986, one of the most famous
primitive tribal ruins of ancient Shu was uncovered at Sanxingdui (Three Stars
Mound), which is located in the northeastern corner of the Sichuan plain. Ar
chaeological studies of the cultural relics found in the many layers of the site re
vealed a significant civilization existing as early as approximately 5,000 to 3,000
years ago, dating from the late Neolithic age to the Shang dynasty. Among the
artifacts were pottery, jade, and gold or bronze figures, such as a gilded wooden
walking stick that symbolizes the power of the king of Shu. Other artifacts in
clude a set of bronze masks displaying characteristics of local mythological fig
ures. These characteristics include high noses, wide mouths, and, most notice
ably, bulging eyes; some even portray the eyeballs sticking out of the mask like
short pillars. Though the origin and race of these Sanxingdui people remain a
mystery, many scholars think the bronze masks with protruding eyes are the
statues of Cancong, the founding god of the Shu tribe.

CANGJIE
Cangjie is the famous culture hero who invented Chinese characters. He is said
to be an official historiographer of Huang Di in mythical history.
The records about Cangjie’s invention can be found in texts of the Warring
States era, and these records are quite detailed in the Han era. These accounts,
like many other mythological recordings, are incomplete and sometimes con
flict with each other. Cangjie is described in these writings as having remarkable
vision and ability. He had four eyes and was able to write when he was born. He
examined the constellations, observed the footprints of birds and beasts, and
studied the signs visible on turtles’ shells, birds’ feathers, mountains and rivers,
and fingers and palms. From these observations he understood that natural phe
nomena could be differentiated and marked by pictographic signs. Relying on
these signs, he created Chinese characters. This invention was such a great
event that afterward millet fell down like rain from heaven, and ghosts cried
during the night. Some scholars interpret that such miraculous phenomena
show the magical power of writing. But Gao You (third century CE), a scholar
who annotated many of the classics, explained that along with the invention of
writing, deceit appeared too. Humans began to neglect farming, their essential
work, and attend to trifle benefits. Heaven knew they would be hungry, so it
rained millet. And the ghosts were afraid that they would be accused by man’s
writing, so they cried.
The Cangjie myth continues to be told in contemporary China. A story col
lected in Shaanxi Province describes the mythic process of how Cangjie invented
the characters. Cangjie was an official of Huang Di whose main duty was to record
things that happened. He used knotted ropes of various sizes and colors to memo
rize different events and experiences. But it eventually became difficult to recall
what each knot meant. Cangjie decided to find an easier way to record human his
tory and thoughts. He visited many thoughtful people for inspiration. Then he
lived in seclusion in a cave and created signs based upon pictographs. The word A

(the sun) was created according to
the round shape of the sun, the word
B (the moon) was created according
to the shape of the crescent, the word
C (human) imitated the profile of a
man, and the word D (claw) imitated
the footprint of birds and beasts. He
called these words zi (characters).
After this invention he began to
teach people everywhere to write
these characters. Since the written
characters he invented were “as
many in number as ten liters of rape
seed,” people could not learn and re
member that large amount. Even
Confucius, the founder of Confu
cianism and one of the greatest edu
cators in ancient China, only learned
70 percent of the original amount.
Cangjie felt very disappointed and
annoyed, so he threw the other 30
percent away to foreign countries.
That was the origin of other charac
ters of foreign languages.
Another modern myth spread
in Sichuan Province associates Cang
jie’s invention with Nüwa, the goddess and creator of humans. Cangjie used E
(meaning “woman”) as a character element and combined other components,
then created some words with negative meanings, such as F (“wicked”) and G
(“demon”), because he looked down on women. The great mother of humans,
Nüwa, was very upset about this. She accused Cangjie of prejudice and asked
him to create some good words with e. At last, Cangjie invented the words h
(“good”) and i (“mother”).
Like most deities of Chinese mythology, Cangjie is part of the popular reli
gion of many people and is respected and worshiped in rituals. During the Song
dynasty he was worshiped as the ancestor who founded the professions of the Xu
Li group of people, petty officials taking charge of documents and paperwork in
government who therefore handled words every day. He was called “King
Cang.” According to Shilin Yanyu (Records of History and Anecdotes, written
by a Song dynasty writer, Ye Mengde, 1077–1148 CE), every autumn, many Xu Li
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 85

in the capital put their money together and held a festival to worship King Cang.
They often drank all day during the festival. Today, one can also find evidence of
similar worship in Shangdong, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and other provinces, such
as Cangjie’s Tombs, Cangjie’s Temples, and Cangjie’s Platforms, where he is said
to have invented the characters. These relics illustrate people’s great respect for
and remembrance of Cangjie. Among them, Cangjie Temple in Baishui County,
Shaanxi Province, is the largest tribute. In local legends, Cangjie is said to have
been born here, created words here, and been buried here after his death. He also
is given the title of respect “The Saint Cang.” Since heaven rained millet after
Cangjie created words, people in Shaanxi Province hold a magnificent festival
every lunar April at the jieqi of Gu Yu (literally means “Grain Rain,” one of the
twenty-four jieqi. In the traditional Chinese calendar, one solar year is divided
into twenty-four terms, called “twenty-four jieqi.” The word jieqi refers to a day
marking one of the twenty-four divisions of one solar year). The festival usually
lasts seven to ten days. People will offer Saint Cang steamed breads with various
patterns and designs, and perform local dramas for his entertainment. They pray
for his blessing. Customs relating to writing and characters are quite popular
here. Paper with words on it is not allowed to be thrown away. Pillows often are
embroidered with characters. Children will worship Saint Cang, instead of Con
fucius, before they become elementary school students. And students often
touch the stone tablet in Cangjie Temple, believing that by doing so their hand
writing will become good.

CHANG’E
Chang’e is the spirit of the moon, one of the most well-known goddesses in Chi
nese mythology. She stole the elixir of immortality from her husband, the great
hero Yi, and flew to the moon.
Chang’e was originally called Heng’e, though later the name Chang’e be
came popularly used. Since the character heng in her name happened to be the
same character used in a certain Han emperor’s name, Heng’e’s name had to be
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
86



According to Chinese tradition, at the Mid-Autumn Festival, many families will hang a painting of Chang’e and make offerings to her. In this painting, Chang’e is standing under the laurel tree with a maidservant holding a feather fan to serve her, while a rabbit is pounding the elixir of immortality. Beijing, 2004. (Courtesy of An Deming)



changed to Chang’e or to a different Chinese heng character due to the taboo of
sharing an imperial Han name. Some scholars believe that Chang’e is originally
the twelve moons’ mother, Changxi, since they both have direct relationships
with the moon and their names could be the same in ancient Chinese phonology
(Yuan 1993, 463; Gu 1979).
Early traces of the Chang’e myth are found in the initial periods of the War
ring States era (fifth century BC). In the divination book of that time, Guizang
(The Storehouse of All Things, now known only through later quotation), which
was written for shamans’ divination, Chang’e was said to have stolen the elixir
of immortality from Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of the West. She reportedly
consumed it, then flew to the moon and became the spirit of the moon. How
ever, the story recorded here was simple and did not mention Yi, Chang’e’s hus
band, at all.
A more complete story about Chang’e appeared in Huainanzi at the begin
ning of the Han dynasty. Yi got the elixir of immortality from Xiwangmu, but
Heng’e stole it from him and consumed it. Then she flew to the moon. Yi was
very disappointed but could not recover the elixir (chapter 6). Gao You, the Han
annotator of many classics, added that Heng’e was Yi’s wife.
In some versions, Chang’e is said to metamorphose into an ugly toad after
she escapes to the moon. This is usually interpreted as a punishment for her be
havior of stealing the precious elixir and forsaking her husband. In Han iconog
raphy a toad often appears in the moon, standing on its hind legs, holding a pes
tle and pounding the elixir of immortality in a mortar. Many scholars think this
toad is none other than Chang’e herself. She has been punished and transformed
into a toad, and has to pound the elixir for all time (Yuan 1993, 235). Li Shangyin
(ca. 813–858 CE), a famous Tang poet, also mentioned that “Chang’e endlessly
pounds the elixir of immortality in a mortar” in one of his poems.
In some other versions, however, the creature pounding the elixir in the
moon is a rabbit. Since it is pure white, it is often called the “Jade Rabbit.” In
some later iconography or literature, Chang’e is often depicted as a beautiful
goddess, holding the jade rabbit in her arms, or the jade rabbit is pounding the
elixir while Chang’e is not working at all.
In fact, the belief that there is a toad or a rabbit in the moon appears quite
early too. This belief also can be found in texts from the Warring States era. And
it is used to explain the shadow on the surface of the bright moon. Wen Yiduo, a
modern Chinese scholar, argued that the earliest mythical creature appearing in
the moon was the toad; then the toad and rabbit appeared together; later only
the rabbit showed in the moon (Wen 1982, 313–338). Nevertheless, it is evident
that the toad and rabbit in the moon (they seem not to have pounded the elixir
in the earliest accounts) were originally independent of the Chang’e myth, and
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
88



they were combined into it during its development process. In Han dynasty
iconography the rabbit can often be seen. Sometimes it is running on the moon,
and sometimes it is pounding the elixir in a mortar in front of Xiwangmu, the
owner of the elixir of immortality, and her husband, Dongwanggong. However,
in as late as the Jin dynasty, the pounding rabbit has somehow changed its host
ess and living place. It moves onto the moon and becomes Chang’e’s companion
and continues its pounding work there.
Chang’e is not the only immortal inhabiting the moon. She has a neighbor
named Wu Gang, though there is no clear evidence showing any direct associa
tion between them. Wu Gang is also a person who does something wrong and
therefore is punished. The theme of “living on the moon as a punishment” is
clearly expressed in his story. According to Youyang Zazu (A Miscellany from
Youyang, by a Tang writer, Duan Chengshi, d. 863 CE), a cassia tree and a toad
were on the moon. The tree was 5,000 feet high. A man named Wu Gang was
chopping at the base of the tree. Since he made a mistake in his quest for im
mortality, he was punished and made to chop the cassia tree. However, when
ever he chopped it, the gash healed itself at once. So he had to do the same futile
work forever. This punishment is comparable to that of Sisyphus, the Greek
mythical hero who is forced to roll a stone up a steep hill, and whenever he
reaches the top, it tumbles down and he has to roll it up again.
After the Six Dynasties era (386–589 CE), Chang’e’s unfortunate destiny
gradually receives more sympathy. Many poems written during this era and dur
ing the Tang dynasty showed, on the one hand, blame of Chang’e for her theft of
the elixir and abandonment of her husband, and, on the other hand, sympathy
for her lonely and dreary life alone on the cold and shadowy moon. In these
poems she often was described as a beautiful goddess, her metamorphosis into
the ugly toad gradually becoming forgotten.
Today, Chang’e symbolically represents women’s beauty, gentleness, ele
gance, and quietness. Depictions of Chang’e as a charming and graceful figure
frequently appear in oral literature, cartoons, paintings, paper-cuts, poems, op
eras, novels, and other creative works. In particular, at the Mid-Autumn Festival
held every fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, Chang’e’s figure commonly
adorns the mooncake boxes along with the bright full moon, the cassia tree, and
the jade rabbit.
The Chang’e myth continues to be popularly transmitted in contemporary
China. Compared to ancient written recordings, the modern Chang’e myth
seems more complex and rational. The myths usually appear as combinations of
many mythical fragments relating to Chang’e, Yi, or Xiwangmu; they try to give
a reasonable cause for Chang’e’s behavior. A common story explains the origin
of the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the ancient past, there was a hero named Yi who
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 89



was excellent at shooting. His wife was Chang’e. One year, the ten suns rose in
the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns
and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the
elixir of immortality. Yi did not want to leave Chang’e and be immortal without
her, so he let Chang’e keep the elixir. But Fengmeng, one of his apprentices,
knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi
went hunting, Fengmeng broke into Yi’s house and forced Chang’e to give the
elixir to him. Chang’e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into
the sky. Since she loved her husband very much and hoped to live nearby, she
chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had
happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang’e liked in
the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activi
ties, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang’e they participated in these
sacrifices with Yi. From then on, holding a memorial ceremony on the fifteenth
of August in the lunar calendar has become a tradition and has spread through
out the country.
Another common version provides different reasons why Chang’e flees to
the moon. After the hero Hou Yi shot down nine of the ten suns, he was pro
nounced king by the thankful people. However, he soon became a conceited and
tyrannical ruler. In order to live long without death, he asked for the elixir from
Xiwangmu. But his wife, Chang’e, stole it on the fifteenth of August because she
did not want the cruel king to live long and hurt more people. She took the
magic potion to prevent her husband from becoming immortal. Hou Yi was so
angry when he discovered that Chang’e took the elixir, he shot at his wife as she
flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang’e fled to the moon and became
the spirit of the moon. Hou Yi died soon because he was overcome with great
anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang’e on every lunar fifteenth of
August to commemorate Chang’e’s action.
In spite of her different motivations and causes for flying into the moon,
Chang’e is described as a kind, smart, and self-sacrificing lady in both of these
versions.
Today during the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, many Han Chinese
families will still offer a sacrifice to the moon by laying out mooncakes (round
pastries stuffed with sweet bean paste or salted egg yolk) and round fruits in
their yards. They wish for their families’ reunion and harmony. Then, they will
eat the cakes and fruits while enjoying the beautiful sight of the bright full
moon. On this occasion parents will often tell the Chang’e myth to their chil
dren. And they may say that when the moon is full, they can see Chang’e, the
cassia tree, and the jade rabbit there in the moon.

CHANGXI
Mother of the twelve moons, Changxi is also one of Di Jun’s wives.
In spite of her high status in mythology, the Changxi myth is quite sparse.
Her accomplishment mainly appears in Shanhaijing, which states that there
was a lady who spent her time bathing the moons. She was Di Jun’s wife, named
Changxi. Changxi gave birth to the twelve moons and was beginning to bathe
them at this time (chapter 16). This text does not mention what the twelve
moons did to occupy themselves. Another two chapters of the same book depict
that a lady named Xihe gave birth to ten suns and bathed them in the Gan Gulf.
The ten suns lived on the Fusang tree. When one sun finished its work and came
back home, another sun would go out instead (chapters 14 and 15). This may
suggest similarities in how the twelve moons worked.
Though the Changxi myth is not very complete, it contains certain motifs,
such as “there is more than one moon in the ancient past,” “the moon is born
from a goddess,” and “bathing (or washing) the moon.” These motifs can be
found in the stories of many ethnic groups in China. The number of the moons
varies—it can be five, seven, nine, ten, twelve, or other numbers. The moons
may be created by gods and may be born from goddesses. In Shanhaijing, the rea
son the moons needed to be bathed is unclear. Some myths that are spread in the
Miao, Buyi, and Yi ethnic groups explain that the sun and the moon needed to be
washed in order to cleanse them of the dust they accumulated during their work
and to make them bright again.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 91



Changxi sometimes is identified as Chang’e, who stole the elixir of immor
tality from her husband, Yi, and flew to the moon to become the spirit of the
moon. Some Chinese scholars believe they are actually the same goddess be
cause they both have direct relationships with the moon and their names could
be the same in ancient Chinese phonology (Yuan 1993, 463; Gu 1979).

CHIYOU
Chiyou was the offspring of Yan Di (the Flame Emperor), the god of war, and the
inventor of military weapons. He rebelled against Huang Di but failed in the war
and was killed. His shackles turned into a maple tree.
Fragmentary versions of the Chiyou myth can be found scattered through
out various ancient texts. In these narratives, Chiyou is depicted as the descen
dent of Yan Di. He invented military weapons such as the spear, dagger-axe,
sword, and halberd. In one version, he had eighty brothers (seventy-one brothers
in another version), each of them with an animal body, bronze head, and iron
forehead, who spoke in a human language. They used sand and stone as their
food. Other versions state that Chiyou took iron and stone as his food and that
he had a human body, horned head, ox hooves, four eyes, six hands, and ears and
temples like swords and spears. The main event of his life story is recorded in
Shanhaijing. Chiyou is said to have made weapons and attacked Huang Di.
Thus, Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack against him in the
wilderness of the central plain. Yinglong began by storing all the water. Chiyou
asked Feng Bo and Yu Shi to release a cloudburst. Then Huang Di asked the
drought goddess Ba to descend from heaven and stop the rain. This eventually
killed Chiyou (chapter 17).
The war between Chiyou and Huang Di is one of the fiercest battles among
gods in Chinese mythology, since both sides were very powerful. There are
many stories that describe the process and circumstances of the war. One story
states that when Chiyou attacked Huang Di, no one was able to stop him be
cause he butted people with his horns. In one version, Chiyou was said to be
able to soar into the sky and surmount the dangerous and difficult obstructions.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
92



But Huang Di made a drum from the hide of Kui, a one-legged mythical beast,
and beat it many times. The sound it made was so great that it prevented
Chiyou from flying away. So Chiyou was caught and killed by Huang Di. An
other version states that Chiyou led many ferocious mythical animals to attack
Huang Di at the Zhuolu plain. So Huang Di ordered his subjects to blow horns
sounding like dragons to threaten them. Another version said that Chiyou could
stir up clouds and mist. When he fought with Huang Di, he made heavy fog for
three days. Huang Di’s army was caught in it and could not figure out their di
rection. Huang Di then invented the compass and guided his army out of the
fog. Thus, Huang Di defeated Chiyou and killed him. When Chiyou was exe
cuted, his head and body were cut off and buried in different places, and his
shackles turned into a maple tree.
Even after his death, Chiyou was still considered a powerful and awful god.
One version of the myth said that many years after Huang Di won the battle and
killed Chiyou, the world became troubled and confused. In order to deter his
people from revolting, Huang Di drew Chiyou’s picture and showed it to them,
after which the world became peaceful again. During the Qin and Han dynasties,
Chiyou was worshiped as the god of war by the army leader and even the First
Emperor of Qin (Shiji, chapter 8).
In addition to myths about Chiyou, he survives in customs and beliefs. Ac
cording to Shuyiji (A Record of Accounts of Marvels, written by Ren Fang in the
Six Dynasties era), there was a kind of drama called “Chiyou’s Game” in Ji
Province. When dancing it, the local people formed into groups of twos or
threes. They wore horns on their heads and butted each other. This custom
probably started the horn-butting game in the Han period. In the villages of
Taiyuan, people did not use ox heads when offering sacrifices to Chiyou, because
Chiyou was ox-headed himself.
Chiyou is worshiped as the remote ancestor of the Miao ethnic group. Beliefs
about him can be found in aspects of Miao’s daily life today. For example, Miao
people worship oxen and maple trees. Oxen are thought to be a symbol of luck
and of heroism, which can bring safety and prosperity. Designs of ox horns are
embroidered on their clothes or carved on their silver decorations. In Miao
mythology, Jiangyang, an ancestor of the Miao people, was born from the egg of a
goddess who was born from a maple tree. In Chenbu, Hunan Province, Miao peo
ple believe that the maple god can expel evils. In Wenshan, Maguan, and other
Miao areas in Yunnan Province, a traditional festival called Trembling the Flower
Mountain is held once every year. It is said that this festival originated from the
Chiyou mythic event. After being defeated by Huang Di, Chiyou led his tribes
back into the thickly forested mountains. In order to call together the scattered
people over the mountains, he planted a long trunk with a colorful red waistband
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 93



on the mountain and asked the young to dance and blow reed pipes around it. On
hearing the sound, people came from all directions. Chiyou gathered them, and
they continued to fight against Huang Di. The custom of dancing and blowing
reed pipes around a flower-wreathed pole lasted for generations and has become a
traditional festival for the Miao people. The colorful cloth tied to the pole was
said to be “Chiyou’s flag.” A song is sung when the pole is planted. The song nar
rates how Chiyou, the Miao ancestor, fought with Huang Di, the Han ancestor,
and how he was defeated and killed in the end, and thus the Miao people had to
flee from the Central Plain toward the southern mountains.

CORDS OF THE EARTH
Cords tied to the earth supposedly prevented it from collapsing. In Chinese
mythology, these cords are commonly called Di Wei (di means “the earth,” and
wei means, basically, “cords.”)
The concept of holder(s) preventing the earth from sinking can be found
among many people. In Chinese mythology, the holder could be a divine creature
such as a turtle, cow, fish, dragon, or snake that supports the earth from under
ground. Versions of this motif include four cords tied up to the four corners of the
square earth, or several pillars (four, five, eight, etc.) holding the earth in place.
In some ancient texts, the earth cords were said to have been broken off dur
ing a war in the remote past. According to Liezi, there were flaws in the sky and
the earth when it was created; therefore, Nüwa melted stones of five different
colors to repair the defective sky, and cut the legs from a huge tortoise and set
them up to support the four extremities of the sky. However, sometime after
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
94



this, Gonggong fought with Zhuanxu to be the Supreme Emperor and failed.
Gonggong was so angry that he butted into Mount Buzhou, one of the sky pil
lars, and damaged it. The cords of the earth were broken off too. Thereafter, the
sky tilted toward the northwest, and that is why the sun, moon, and stars move
in that direction. The earth had a flaw in the southeast, and that is why the
rivers and rains flow in that direction. The same story was told in Lunheng, but
the logical connection between Gonggong’s war and Nüwa’s mending work is
just the opposite. It states that because of Gonggong’s war with Zhuanxu, the
sky pillar Mount Buzhou collapsed and the cords of the earth were snapped.
Therefore, Nüwa smelted colorful stones to patch the sky and cut the legs off a
tortoise to support the four extremities of the sky. It is clear that these two sepa
rate myths gradually became confused and merged into a new syncretic version
(Yang 1997, 46–51; Birrell 1993, 69).
Some scholars claim that Di Wei refers to the four corners of the earth, be
cause wei also has the meaning of “corner” (Yuan 1985, 151).

CROW OF THE SUN
The crow of the sun functions as the spirit of the sun or, in some versions, the
bearer of the sun across the sky. Sometimes it is said to be three-legged, and its
number might be ten, as many as the suns in ancient times.
The belief in a crow settling in the sun (or in each individual sun) or bearing
the sun across the sky appears very early in Chinese texts. According to a text in
Shanhaijing, in the great wilderness there was a huge tree named Fusang (Lean
ing Mulberry) growing on the top of a mountain. Its trunk reached a height of 300
li (about 100 miles). Beside the mountain there was a valley named Tang Valley,
in which another Fusang tree was growing. Here was the place from which the
ten suns rose and set back down. As soon as one sun came back from its journey
crossing the sky, another sun started forth. Each of the ten suns was carried by a
crow. Another earlier text, “Tianwen,” also mentioned the crow of the sun along
with the story of Yi in an ambiguous way, asking: “Why did Yi shoot down the
suns? Why did the crows shed their feathers?” Wang Yi, the Han commentator of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 95



“Tianwen,” cited a paragraph from
Huainanzi to explain these questions,
which stated that at the time of Yao (a
demigod and one of the three sage
kings), the ten suns rose together and
burned up the woods and grass. Yao then
ordered Yi to shoot down the ten suns in
the sky, and Yi shot down nine of them.
The nine crows settling in these suns
died, and their feathers fell out. It seems
that the crows in the suns, which func
tion as the suns’ spirits, are in some de
gree different from those who are bear
ers of the suns, whose main function is
to carry each sun across the sky while
they are on duty.
In some versions, especially in some
texts during and after the Han dynasty,
the crow of the sun is sometimes said to
be three-legged. For example, both Huai
nanzi and Lunheng mention that there
was a three-legged crow in the sun (the
texts could also be interpreted with a plu
ral reading that there were three-legged crows in the suns). Another version
recorded during the Six Dynasties era stated that two sorts of mythical grasses of
immortality grew in the northeast and southwest: one was named Di Ri (di means
“ground,” ri means “sun”), and the other was named Chun Sheng (chun means
“spring,” sheng means “grow”). The three-legged crow liked eating these grasses
very much. It descended from heaven to the earth several times in order to eat
them. But Xihe, the mother of the ten suns, did not like it to do so. She wanted to
control the crow, so she covered its eyes with her hands to stop it from flying
down.

DI JUN
Di Jun, or Emperor Jun, is one of the supreme gods in ancient time. He is a com
panion to Xihe, mother of the suns, and a companion to Changxi, mother of the
moons. Many of his descendants are famous culture heroes or demigods.
Scholars presumed that Di Jun was the supreme god of the Yin people in
east China. In ancient times, Di Jun was as great to the Yin people as Huang Di
was to the Xia people from west China. However, the Di Jun myth can be found
in no other documents save for five chapters of Shanhaijing. According to Chi
nese mythologists such as Yuan Ke, this is because Di Jun gradually faded in
popularity as a deity since the kingdom of Yin collapsed. Fewer people contin
ued to tell the Di Jun myth during the Warring States era and the early Han pe
riod, the time when Shanhaijing was compiled (Yuan 1993, 179–181).
One of Di Jun’s famous deeds is that he made friends with the phoenix. In
the Great Wilderness lived a flock of five-colored birds. They were dancing in
pairs. The god Di Jun desired to go down to the earth and make friends with
them. These birds looked after his two altars on the earth. This story is recorded
in chapter 14 in Shanhaijing; according to a text in chapter 16, the five-colored
bird is a type of phoenix.
In a story from chapter 18, Di Jun is described as the god who bestowed spe
cial power on the archer Yi. He gave Yi a red bow and arrows with white feath
ers, placing Yi on the earth to help all the countries there. Therefore Yi started
his work of saving people from hardship.
A text in chapter 17 concerns Di Jun’s bamboo forest. Beyond the northeast
seas, in the Great Wilderness around the river, there was a mountain named
Mount Fuyu. Beside the mountain there was a mound. It was about 300 li (about
100 miles) in circumference. To the south of the mound lay Di Ku’s bamboo for
est. The bamboo here was so large that just one knot of it could be used to make
a boat.
The most spectacular stories associated with Di Jun are about his two con
sorts, Xihe and Changxi. An account in Shanhaijing (chapter 15) relates that be
yond the east sea and next to the Gan Gulf was the kingdom of Xihe. A lady
named Xihe married Di Jun and gave birth to the ten suns. She spends her time
bathing the suns in the Gan Gulf.
Changxi is depicted in chapter 16 in the same book. In the Great Wilderness
there was a mountain called Mount Riyue (Mount Sun and Moon). It was in the
key position of the heavens. At this mountain there was a lady, Changxi, who
also was Di Jun’s wife. Changxi had given birth to twelve moons. In the text,
Changxi was just beginning to bathe them.
Many of Di Jun’s descendants founded their own kingdoms down on the
earth. These offspring, such as people in the countries of Zhongrong, Siyou,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 97



Baimin, Heichi, and Sanshen, are also described in Shanhaijing (chapters 14 and
15). They all were extraordinary people who possessed special powers, especially
the power to control the four beasts: tiger, panther, bear, and brown bear. This
power was partly inherited from their divine ancestor, Di Jun.
Among Di Jun’s descendants were many skillful craftsmen who invented fun
damental items for human beings. Texts in Shanhaijing (chapter 18) also state
that Di Jun fathered Yanlong, who invented the lute and the zither; Di Jun had
eight sons who created songs and dance; and that Di Jun fathered Sanshen, and
Sanshen fathered Yijun (also called Qiaorui), who created all sorts of crafts for the
people on the earth. In addition, Di Jun sired Yuhao, who fathered Yinliang, who
fathered Fanyu, who first invented the boat; Fanyu in turn sired Xizhong, and
Xizhong fathered Jiguang, the first person to make a chariot with wood.
Di Jun’s most famous and divine son is Houji. Houji brought varieties of
grain to people and taught them cultivating and harvesting. He later became
the ancestor of the Zhou people. Houji’s younger brother, Taixi, fathered Shujun
(in another version, Shujun was said to be Houji’s grandson). Shujun invented
the technique of plowing and took the place of his father and Houji to sow
grains.

DI KU
Di Ku, or Emperor Ku, also called Gaoxin, is a grandson of Huang Di and one of
the Five August Emperors in the mythical history of China. During his reign he
oversaw the composition of many Chinese traditional songs and the invention
of several musical instruments. By his order, his two sons who fought every day
became star gods. He is also known as the father of Houji, ancestor of the Zhou
people, and the father of Qi, ancestor of the Shang people. In some accounts he is
identified as the father of Yao, one of the three sage kings.
In the mythical history of China, Di Ku is given a very high status. He was
identified as one of the Five August Emperors, as well as one of the earliest
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
98



rulers of the country (various names are given in different contexts). However,
the Di Ku myth is quite sparse in written recordings. In texts compiled in the
early to mid-Han dynasty, such as Shiji and Dadai Liji (The Elder Dai’s Record
of Ritual, ca. first century BC), fragments of Di Ku’s mythical deeds are recorded.
When he was born, Di Ku showed a divine ability: he could utter his name,
“Jun.” When he grew up and became the emperor, Di Ku would ride a dragon in
the spring and summer, and a horse in the fall and winter.
In a story recorded in Lüshi Chunqiu (Annals of Master Lü, third century
BC), Di Ku was associated with the invention of several traditional musical in
struments and songs. Following Di Ku’s order, Xianhei composed music for
these songs, and Yourui invented musical instruments such as the small drum,
drum, bell, chime, reed pipe, pipe, clay ocarina, and flute. When those tasks
were complete, Di Ku ordered them to perform. Meanwhile, he commanded a
phoenix to dance.
Several other stories related to Di Ku feature his descendants. One of these
stories tells of Di Ku’s two sons who became star gods. Ebo and Shichen were
sons of Di Ku. At first they both lived at Kuanglin, but they could not bear each
other and often fought. Di Ku was so displeased with this that he moved Ebo to
Shangqiu and assigned him to be in charge of the Chen star. He moved Shichen
to Daxia and assigned him to be in charge of the Shen star. From then on Ebo
was worshiped by the Shang people, and Shichen was worshiped by the Tang
(Yao) people. That is why the Chen star is also called the Shang star. The Shen
star is equivalent to stars in Orion, and the Chen star is the same as those in
Antares. They never appear in the sky at the same time. This phenomenon is
often depicted in literature as an image to symbolize good friends who are sepa
rated by distance or persons who are on bad terms. For instance, Du Fu (712–770
CE), the famous poet of the Tang dynasty, wrote in his poem, “It is almost as
hard for friends to meet as for the Shen and Shang (Chen) stars.”
In a story recorded in Shiben (The Origin of Hereditary Families, ca. third
century BC), Di Ku’s four consorts are mentioned. These four ladies were Jiang
Yuan, Jiandi, Qingdu, and Changyi. Jiang Yuan gave birth to Houji, the god of
grain and ancestor of the Zhou people. Jiandi gave birth to Qi, ancestor of the
Shang people. Qingdu bore Di Yao (Emperor Yao), the first of the three sage kings
in ancient China. Changyi bore Di Zhi (Emperor Zhi), who inherited Di Ku’s
crown but resigned and handed over the crown to his brother Yao after nine
years.
Another version about Di Ku’s companions is from Shiyiji (Researches into
Lost Records, ca. fourth century). It tells of another of Di Ku’s consorts, a lady
from Zoutu who gave birth to eight sons. Each of them was born after she
dreamed that she swallowed the sun. People called these sons “the Eight Gods.”
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 99



As a famous god and sovereign, Di Ku is also linked with the Panhu myth,
the ancestral myth of the Miao, Yao, She, and Li ethnic people in south China.
Worried about an imminent invasion, Di Ku issued an imperial decree that if
anyone in the world could bring back the enemy general’s head, he would be re
warded with the emperor’s daughter as a wife, along with many other rewards.
Panhu, a mythical dog in the royal palace, accomplished the mission and re
ceived the princess as his wife. They thus became ancestors of several ethnic
groups in south China.
Some scholars presume that Di Ku also is identified as Di Jun, another
mythical sovereign in ancient China. The reasons for this conclusion include
the evidence that Di Ku took the same name of “Jun” as Di Jun; they both had a
son named Houji; Di Ku’s wife, Changyi, and Di Jun’s wife, Changxi, actually
are the same name; and so on. However, in the scattered myth texts and in the
mythological history, Di Ku and Di Jun are usually treated as different gods.

DRAGON
One of the most important mythical creatures in Chinese mythology, the
dragon is the controller of the rain, the river, the sea, and all other kinds of
water; symbol of divine power and energy; great helper of heroes; and bearer of
gods or demigods. In the imperial era it was identified as the symbol of imperial
power.
The figure of the dragon appeared within the modern boundaries of China at
least 6,000 years ago. In 1987, at the Xishuipo Cemetery Ruins in Puyang
County, Henan Province, figures of a dragon and a tiger were unearthed in a
tomb. Both of them were made from numerous shells. The dragon measured
1.78 meters (nearly 6 feet) in length and 0.67 meter (2.2 feet) in height. Dating
back to over 6,400 years, it is presently the earliest image of a dragon uncovered
in Chinese archeology. Thus, it is widely known by the title “the First Dragon of
China.” In another archeological project a jade coiled dragon was uncovered that
dates to around 5,000 years ago. This dragon was discovered in the Hongshan
Culture relics (which are mainly located in the area between modern Inner
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
100



Mongolia, Liaoning Province, and Hebei Province). It is about 26 centimeters
(10.4 inches) long and coiled like the letter C. The figure has a snake’s body, a
boar’s head, a tight-lipped snout, and two bulging eyes.
In Chinese mythology and belief, the dragon often appears as a most power
ful and divine creature. People believe that the dragon can fly in the sky and
make clouds with its breath; wherever it appears there will be clouds. Among its
many miraculous abilities, the power of controlling rain and the river is the

most well-known. In people’s imaginations, dragons usually live in water and
are the controllers of rain. If there is a drought in any area, by praying to a
dragon, residents hope to get rain.
In Chinese scholarship, there are mainly two hypotheses concerning the es
sential characteristics of the dragon. One hypothesis aims to find a real proto
type of the dragon. This hypothesis often identifies the dragon with a crocodile,
tornado, or lightning, or even the river. Another hypothesis states that the
dragon is a joint image of different animals; scholars work to discover each of
these components by studying ancient texts. This hypothesis links the dragon
with the fanciful images of the snake, lizard, deer, and horse, and states that the
dragon is a combination of totems that originally belonged to several main tribes
that integrated with each other in ancient China. These hypotheses are only two
of the many ideas about the origins of the dragon. However, although people
have been probing into facts and stories about the dragon for hundreds of years,
the dragon has yet elluded final interpretations.
Although the dragon is a mythological creature, there are abundant detailed
descriptions about its figure in classical documents and in oral tradition. Some
versions state that there are several varieties of dragons. The dragons that have
scales are called Jiao Long (long means “dragon” in Chinese), those that have
horns are called Qiu Long, and those that do not have horns are called Chi Long.
In many texts, the dragon’s figure is depicted in a very detailed way. Some say
that dragons had hang-scales one chi (one third of one meter) in diameter below
their jaw. Some say that dragons appear with a horse’s head and snake’s tail. And
in another version a dragon appears with a deer’s horns, an ox’s ears, a camel’s
head, a rabbit’s eyes, a snake’s neck, a clam’s abdomen, a fish’s scales, a tiger’s
paws, and an eagle’s claws. Some documents note that dragons have a body part
on their heads shaped like overlapping hills. This part is called Chimu. Without
it dragons cannot fly into the sky. It is also said that below a dragon’s jaw grows
the most valuable pearl.
Another famous attribute regarding the dragon is that dragons may give
birth to nine varieties of offspring that are quite different from the dragon’s
species. Each kind of offspring has a specific name, and they are very dissimilar
in appearance, nature, and ability. However, though this belief is well-known,
there are no conclusive findings about the names of the dragon’s nine varieties
of offspring. According to the semantic features in traditional Chinese language,
some scholars assert that in early history the Chinese word for “nine” did not
mean a certain amount. It was just a word that generally referred to “many” or
“a lot.” In later times, people considered it to be an exact figure and tried to give
names to the nine varying offspring of the dragon. Therefore, several stories
about these nine offspring appeared. One of the most popular versions identifies

the dragon’s offspring and their abilities. Because of these abilities, they were
used, and continue to be used, as decorations, and thus show people’s belief in
these mythical creatures. The nine offspring are the following: Bixi, which is
good at bearing heavy things, and thus its figure is often sculpted as the founda
tion of stone monuments; Chiwen, keen on looking long distances so that its fig
ure is often painted or sculpted on eaves; Taotie, which is good at drinking water,
thus its figure is usually carved on bridges to prevent flood; Yazi, which is fond of
fighting, thus its figure is often used to decorate the handles of knives and
swords; Bi’an, which hates criminals and therefore its figure often ornaments the
gates of prisons; Suanni, keen on smoke and fire so that its figure often appears
on the lid of incense burners; Baxia, which likes water very much so that its fig
ure is usually carved on the guardrails of bridges; Jiaotu, which dislikes others to
enter its house, thus its figure often appears on the gates of houses; and Pulao,
which likes music and roaring, therefore its figure often decorates bells.
The dragon myths are widely spread in China, not only among Han people
but also in many other ethnic groups.

In the book Shanhaijing, numerous gods or demigods are associated with
dragons. Most of these divine creatures are described as having a dragon’s or
snake’s appearance. Some of them had a dragon’s trunk and a human head, such
as Pangu, Fuxi, Nüwa, Huang Di, Yan Di, the Thunder God living in the Thun
der Marsh, and gods living in areas from Tianyu Mountain to Nanyu Mountain,
from Chanhu Mountain to Qi Mountain, and from Guanling Mountain to Dunti
Mountain. Some of them had a bird’s head and a dragon’s trunk, such as the gods
living in the area from Gui Mountain to Qiwu Mountain, and from Zhaoyao
Mountain to Qiwei Mountain.
One of the most famous dragons in Chinese mythology is Ying Long, or Re
sponding Dragon. It was he who helped Huang Di overcome Chiyou. He is also
said to be the god of rain. In many places people pray to him in order to receive
rain. Another famous dragon recorded in Shanhaijing is Zhulong or Zhuyin,
Torch Dragon or Torch Shadow. He is a deity who composed the universe with
his body.
There are many stories in Shanhaijing that connect heroes with dragons to
explain their miraculous births. In this cluster of myths, the hero’s mother had
an experience of copulating with a divine dragon before she got pregnant and
then gave birth to her hero son. These heroes, including Huang Di, Shennong,
Yao, and Shun, all inherited the dragon’s powers and did many great deeds while
they were growing up.
In Houhanshu (The History of the Eastern Han Dynasty, compiled by Fan
Ye, 398–445 CE) there is a dragon myth told by the Ailaoyi people, an ethnic
group of the Han dynasty. It states in detail that Ailaoyi people in southwest
China are descendants of a divine dragon. According to this story, in the begin
ning there was a woman named Shayi who lived in the area of Lao Mountain.
One day when she was fishing, she was touched by a tree trunk floating in the
water. She then became pregnant and gave birth to ten sons. Thereafter the
trunk changed into a dragon. The dragon came out of the water and asked Shayi,
“Where are the sons you bore for me?” Seeing the dragon, all the sons were
scared and ran away except for the youngest one, who sat with his back against
the dragon. And then the dragon licked the boy on his back. In Shayi’s own lan
guage, “sitting” was pronounced jiu, and “back” was pronounced long. So the
youngest son was named Jiu Long. He had received the dragon father’s caresses
and was very smart. When Jiu Long grew older, he was elected king by his broth
ers. These ten brothers married ten sisters who were born in another family
nearby. All had their children tattooed with patterns of a dragon on their bodies.
This became a convention of their descendants, the Ailaoyi people.
Dragons also appeared as bearers of gods or demigods in many myths. In
Shanhaijing, these kinds of stories are recorded in several sections. For example,
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
104



chapter 6 of that book depicts the god Zhurong with an animal’s trunk and a
human head, and states that he often rode on two dragons. In chapters 7 and 16,
two recordings about Qi (the hero Yu’s son, the first king of the Xia dynasty)
mention that Qi also had two dragons as bearers. Similar depictions can be
found in stories of Huang Di, Zhuanxu, Yuqiang, and Rushou, sporadically ap
pearing in Hanfeizi, Dadai Liji, Liji, and Shanhaijing.
Not all dragons played beneficial roles for human beings. Some dragons were
bad and harmful and often brought disasters to people. One famous example is the
black dragon killed by the goddess Nüwa. The black dragon caused a deluge, and
this flood could not be stopped until the goddess defeated and killed the dragon.
Some renowned stories tell of dragons’ rearing. Several such stories are
recorded in Zuozhuan (Chronicle of Zuo, once attributed to Zuo Qiuming, an an
cient historian who lived in the last stage of the Spring and Autumn era, but
probably compiled in the Warring States period). One is about a dragon raiser. In
ancient times there were people who raised and trained dragons. A famous one
was Dongfu, descendent of Yangshu’an. He loved dragons and could understand a
dragon’s will and interests, and for this reason he raised dragons very well. Many
dragons went to him to be tamed and fed. With these dragons Dongfu served King
Shun, one of the three sage kings. The king therefore bestowed on him Dong and
Huanlong (“Dragon Raiser”) as his family name. Another story associated with
dragon rearing is of Kongjia, the fourteenth king of the Xia dynasty. Because of
his obedience to the god of heaven, Kongjia was given two pairs of dragons to
ride; each pair included one male and one female. But Kongjia could not take care
of them without a dragon raiser. Then a person named Liulei, who had learned
the skill of raising dragons from Huanlong, served Kongjia. Kongjia praised him
and granted him the surname Yulong (“Dragon Trainer”). One day a female
dragon died. Liulei stealthily chopped its meat and cooked it for the king to eat.
Kongjia was so pleased with the meat that soon after, he asked Liulei to cook the
same meal for him again. This scared Liulei—where and how could he get more
dragon meat? He had to escape from the palace.
Many versions of dragon myths orally transmitted in ethnic groups in con
temporary China have more complicated plots. A story told by the Miao people,
an ethnic group in southwest China, mentions that it was a divine dragon that
created human beings. Long ago there were no human beings in the world, but
there was a divine dragon that lived in a cave. One day, many monkeys came to
the cave to play. The divine dragon blew to those monkeys, and the monkeys all
transformed into human beings. As a result the dragon received high respect and
worship from Miao people.
Another ethnic group in southwest China, the Bai, say that it was a dragon
that gave birth to a couple that later became the ancestors of human beings. In
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 105



remote antiquity, the earth consisted of five separate parts. The east was occupied
by birds. The south was occupied by beasts. The west was occupied by insects,
and the north had fishes and shrimp. In the center part lived a female monkey
who had three heads and six arms. The kings of birds, beasts, insects, and fishes
and shrimp were, respectively, the phoenix, the tiger, the bee, and the giant turtle.
They often visited the monkey and had intercourse with her. Long afterward, the
monkey became pregnant. After 9,900 years, the monkey produced ninety-nine
eggs. However, all the eggs except the biggest one were stolen by the kings of the
other four areas. Under the monkey’s cautious care, the biggest egg hatched a
python. Conforming to his monkey mother’s request, the python departed to look
for those eggs stolen by the kings. He defeated and devoured those birds, beasts,
insects, and fishes and shrimp that tried to hinder him along the way. Therefore
his appearance changed completely. He became a strange winged creature that had
a bull’s head, deer’s horns, pig’s mouth, hawk’s paws, and snake’s trunk. He had
become a divine dragon that could fly up to the sky and control the wind and rain.
The four kings were so scared by the dragon that they returned all the eggs to him.
The dragon broke the eggs one by one. Each time he broke an egg, a creature ap
peared. But all of these creatures ran away from the dragon. The only ones who
stayed with the dragon were hatched from the last two eggs; they were a man and
a woman. It was they who bore human beings in later time.
Besides these rich myth texts, there are numerous dragon stories that be
long to the genre of folktale or legend. These kinds of stories are extremely wide
spread in China. Their motifs and plots are also diverse. One of the most famous
dragon tales is about Ye Gao and the dragons. Ye Gao loved dragons very much.
He decorated his whole house with dragon’s figures. Because of this display of
admiration, a dragon was impressed and came down from heaven to visit Ye
Gao. At the glance of a real dragon, Ye Gao was terrified and quickly ran away.
This story is often used as a fable of “Yegong Hao Long” (literally meaning “Lord
Ye loves dragon”) to mock the one who claims to love something but is actually
afraid of it.
In a lot of areas, especially in the east, northeast, and central parts of China,
among Han people there are plentiful stories about Short-Tailed Old Li. Short
Tailed Old Li is a famous dragon god who is said to have had a short tail. The ex
planations for why his tail was short are various. One popular version states that
his father cut off part of his tail. Short-Tailed Old Li was born into a poor family
in Shandong Province as a black dragon. When he was first born and started to
suck his mother’s breasts, she immediately fainted. Then his father came back
from the field. Seeing the strange and ugly newborn baby, the man, already tired
of the family burden, became very angry. He hit the baby with a spade and cut
off part of the baby Li’s tail. The dragon was hurt so severely that he broke the

roof of the house and flew away in a cloud of sparks. He never went home again.
Many texts state that the place that he flew to was northeast China, where he
settled in the Black Dragon River and became the god of that river. He took his
mother’s family name, Li, so he was called Short-Tailed Old Li. After his mother
died, every May 13 of the lunar calendar, the day his mother died, Short-Tailed
Old Li flew back to pay respect at his mother’s grave. Whenever he came back, it
would rain. Therefore people worshiped him as a rain god. They often pray to
him for rain.
Texts about the dragon’s lineal descendants are also a very important and
large part of dragon tales. Differing from the nine varieties of dragon offspring,
these descendants all inherited the dragon’s nature and power. They are authen
tic dragon sons or daughters. A renowned story recorded in a document from the
Tang dynasty tells of a dragon king’s daughter and her ill-fated marriage. A
scholar named Liu Yi failed in the examination to become an official. When he
was on the journey home, he met a pretty lady who was tending sheep in sadness.
She was the daughter of the Dragon King of Dongting Lake and had been married
to the son of the Dragon King of the Jing River. But in the years after she got mar
ried, her husband treated her badly. Eventually she was banished by her parents
in-law to a desolate place to herd sheep. In obedience to the dragon girl’s request
and instructions, Liu Yi visited the dragon palace in Dongting Lake and delivered
the girl’s letter to her family. The dragon girl’s uncle, the Dragon King of the
Qiantang River, was angry at hearing of his niece’s treatment. He flew to the Jing
River, defeated the son of the Dragon King of the Jing River, and devoured him.
Then the dragon girl was rescued and brought home. The Dragon King of the
Qiantang River intended to marry the girl to Liu Yi. Though Liu Yi was fasci
nated by the girl’s beauty and excellence, he refused the Dragon King for ethical
reasons. After he went home with countless rare jewels presented to him at the
dragon palace, Liu Yi was married twice. But each marriage quickly ended with
his wife’s death. A month after he got married for the third time, he learned that
his third wife was actually the dragon girl. They lived together happily, and even
tually both of them became immortals.
As the most powerful divine creature, the dragon’s influence is deeply rooted
in various facets of Chinese culture and society, not only in oral or literate tradi
tions. The dragon is thought to control rain, and whenever there is a drought peo
ple will pray to the dragon for rain. From an ancient era as early as at least the
Shang dynasty (1600 BC–1046 BC) to modern times, in China there have been a
multitude of rituals of praying for rain. Among many of those rituals, the dragon is
often worshiped or given the main role. The ways in which people deal with drag
ons in the ritual differ greatly in different places and eras. According to Chunqiu
Fanlu (Abundant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals), a metaphysical book
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 107



by Dong Zhongshu (former Han, d. 104 BC), as a drought appears, if one makes
several statues of dragons with clay and then asks boys or young men to pace and
dance among these statues, the rain will come. The number of the statues, their
color, and the people who dance in the ritual will be changed according to the
season.
Some local records of the areas in southwest China compiled during the
Qing dynasty describe that in people’s minds a drought can most likely be attrib
uted to the laziness of a dragon. They consequently had specific treatments to
motivate the dragon in order to receive rain. One of those was to throw a tiger’s
bone into the pool where a dragon was thought to live. The dragon would be irri
tated and would fight with the tiger, and this would cause heavy rain. The rea
son for this is that the dragon and the tiger are the most fierce and powerful
creatures, therefore they cannot bear each other. Whenever they see each other,
or even sense a part of the other, they will fight. Another method was to throw
dirty things into a pool. Because the dragon could not bear filth, it would create
rain to clean its pool.
The praying-for-rain ritual is still very popular in many rural areas in con
temporary China, and in the ritual a specific dragon king is usually worshiped as
the main god of rain. In parts of northwest China, for example, every village has
its own local god that is different in name and the powers it has. These kinds of
local gods function as the core being that is worshiped in praying-for-rain rituals,
and many of them are dragon kings.
Though the dragon shows up very early in Chinese history and culture, and
dragon kings have become popular gods in Chinese belief nowadays, the figures of
dragon kings actually did not appear until the Eastern Han dynasty, when Bud
dhism was imported into China. A deity named Naga was linked with the divine
dragon originating in Chinese Buddhism. Because it was thought of as the main
god that took charge of rain, a vital resource for agricultural society, the dragon
king emerging from Chinese Buddhism received positive feedback from people.
Inspired by this, Taoist leaders created their own dragon kings to meet ordinary
people’s needs and hence attract followers. Therefore, many dragon kings emerged
from Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs. People began to believe that in
every sea, river, lake, spring, and even well there must be a dragon king reigning,
and numerous temples for dragon kings were built throughout the country. Each
dragon king was different in power, rank, and ability, but they all were worshiped
as important deities by people in different areas.
The dragon’s figure is also visible in other kinds of customs. The most well
known examples are the customs of the dragon dance and the dragon boat race.
The dragon dance is an activity held primarily at traditional festivals, such as
the Spring Festival, Lantern Festival (on January 15 of the lunar calendar), and
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
108



many kinds of temple fairs. During these holidays, people will prepare for the
dragon dance by constructing a dragon approximately 16 feet long with grass and
cloth or with bamboo strips and paper. Conventionally the dragon dance is per
formed at night, so after shaping a dragon, people will place ornamental candles
inside its trunk. These are called dragon lanterns. In the evening several skilled
performers will hold the dragon lanterns on handles under its trunk with all of
the candles lit, and they will perform the dragon dance in the public square or
along main streets. The scale of a dragon dance festival depends on the size of a
community or temple. This kind of performance was originally held to bring
good weather and good harvests on specific occasions, but nowadays the dragon
dance functions as entertainment. At various celebrations, fairs, and new festi
vals, the dragon dance is performed in a standardized way, and occurs more
often in the daytime rather than its traditional evening performance.
The dragon boat race is often held during the Duanwu Festival on May 5 of
the lunar calendar in river or lake regions in southern China. Sometimes the
race is held among several neighboring villages, and sometimes it is held among
teams throughout a county or even an entire province. The scale of the races
may be very different according to the region they cover, and the dragon boats,
though all carved in the shape of a dragon, also differ in size and quality because
of their owners’ financial resources. In the race, all participating boats will com
pete in a race to determine which boat covers the predetermined distance the
fastest, while the audience stands along the banks and cheers. This forms the
highlight of the Duanwu Festival; accordingly, in many areas in southern China
the festival is called the Dragon Boat Festival.
The origin of the dragon boat race, according to a famous legend, is related
to Qu Yuan, the first great poet in the Warring States era, who drowned himself
in a river on May 5 for the honor of his state and his ambition. When Qu Yuan
threw himself into the Miluo River, people rowed boats on the river to rescue
him. Though Qu Yuan died, this act brought about the custom of the dragon
boat race. However, scholars presume that this custom originated much earlier
than the time of Qu Yuan. It was initially a ritual held to avert evil fortune.
During the imperial era from the Han dynasty to the Qing dynasty, the
dragon was gradually associated with the symbol of the holy imperial power.
Emperors all claimed and tried to testify that they were the sons of heaven as
well as the incarnation of a divine dragon. This greatly strengthened the holy
image and integrity of royalty in the eyes of ordinary people. Meanwhile, the
dragon image that appeared as ornaments on clothes, houses, and many other ar
ticles of everyday use was monopolized by emperors. Commoners who dared to
use the figure of a dragon to ornament any article of everyday use risked execu
tion. This situation did not change until 1911, when the imperial era ended.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 109



Today more and more ordinary Chinese people identify themselves as descen
dants of the dragon. And hence the dragon has become a widely accepted symbol
of cultural and ethnic identity for contemporary Chinese people.

ELIXIR OF IMMORTALITY
Death has been a powerful theme in beliefs, literature, and arts all around the
world. Many Chinese myths explain why humans have to die at a certain time.
Some also note mythical substances that have the magic power of rejecting
death and maintaining life. These mythical substances include special springs,
trees, peaches, grasses, drugs of immortality, and numerous other things. For ex
ample, Shanhaijing mentions the tree of immortality and Chi spring (chi means
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
110



“red”). Guo Pu (276–324 CE), an annotator of Shanhaijing, explained that the
tree of immortality could bring longevity to the one who took a concoction
made from it, and the Chi spring could help one maintain youthfulness. A story
recorded in Bowuzhi (A Treatise on Research into Nature, third to fifth century
CE) states that two officers of Fangfeng, a giant god killed by the god Yu, stabbed
themselves in the heart with their daggers and died. Yu felt sympathetic about
their death, so he pulled out the daggers and revived them with the herb of im
mortality. The two then became the pioneers of the Pierced-Chest People.
Among these mythical substances, the elixir of immortality is the most fa
mous, because it is often linked with some powerful or well-known deities, such
as Xiwangmu (the Queen Mother of the West), Yi, and Chang’e. A popular story
appears in Huainanzi, noting that Yi got the elixir of immortality from Xi
wangmu, but his wife Heng’e stole it from him and consumed it. Then she be
came immortal and flew to the moon. Yi was very disappointed but could not re
gain the elixir.
Xiwangmu is the famous possessor of the precious drug. In Han iconography
a rabbit often pounds the elixir in a mortar in front of her, and sometimes also in
front of her husband, Dongwanggong. Though Chang’e became immortal and
flew to the moon, she was transformed into an ugly toad after she reached the
moon and had to endlessly pound the elixir there. However, later, the pounding
rabbit somehow moved to the moon too and became Chang’e’s companion, con
tinuing its work there.
Xiwangmu does not alone own the elixir of immortality; other deities and
even shamans also have it. In a text in chapter 11 of Shanhaijing, it is written
that east of the Kaiming beast, there were several holy shamans named Peng, Di,
Yang, Lü, Fan, and Xiang. They each held the elixir of immortality and sur
rounded the corpse of the god Zhayu in an attempt to revive him.

FANGFENG
Fangfeng was a god and giant killed by Yu for arriving late to the assembly of the
gods. Yu, the hero who stopped the world flood, assembled all the gods on
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 111



Mount Guiji (located in modern Zhejiang Province), but Fangfeng arrived late.
Yu was very annoyed, so he killed Fangfeng. Since Fangfeng was nearly as tall as
ten meters (33 feet), the executioner had to build a high dike to reach his head.
Another legend also describes Fangfeng as a giant and links him with Confucius.
It states that many years after Fangfeng’s death, one joint of his skeleton was
found but no one except Confucius knew about it. He told Fangfeng’s story and
thought this bone belonged to him. The bone was so huge that it filled an entire
cart. Another Fangfeng myth explains the origin of the Pierced-Chest People.
Two officers of Fangfeng were angry about Yu’s execution of Fangfeng and
wanted to seek revenge for their master. They shot at Yu when he traveled into
Fangfeng’s land. But then there came a large gale, with thunder and heavy rain,
and two dragons ascended to the heavens. The two avengers were so terrified
that they stabbed themselves in the heart with their daggers and died. Yu felt
sympathetic about their death, so he pulled out the daggers and revived them
with the herb of immortality. The two men then became the pioneers of the
Pierced-Chest People.
Fangfeng was also a god in folk belief. An account from Shuyiji recorded the
custom of worshiping Fangfeng in the territory of Wu and Yue (now mainly in
the areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai) during the Six Dynasties era.
Fangfeng’s figure in his temple was often portrayed as having a dragon head, one
eye, ox ears, and two eyebrows that grew together. When the people of Yue held
the sacrifice rite for him, they played a piece of music called “Fangfeng’s ancient
melody,” with bamboo pipes that were three chi long (three chi is equal to one
meter). These pipes sounded like a howl. During the music, three people danced
with their hair draped over their shoulders.
The Fangfeng myth and legend are still told in contemporary China, espe
cially in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. Nearly thirty Fangfeng myths and leg
ends were collected in the late 1980s. Contrary to those unclear and fragmented
ancient stories in which Fangfeng is portrayed only as a faulted and lesser god of
Yu, with his other attributes and functions ambiguous, these modern narratives
show strong affection toward Fangfeng. He is depicted as a great culture hero
who worked very hard to control the flood and save people but was wrongly
killed by Yu. One story collected in 1987 in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province,
explains the origin of the sacrifice rite to Fangfeng and the reason Fangfeng is
called “king.” After Yu controlled the world flood, he held an assembly on
Mount Guiji to celebrate the success. But Fangfeng did not arrive until the as
sembly was ending. Yu was very upset. He thought Fangfeng was too conceited
and defiant, so he decided to execute him as a warning to others. Since Fangfeng
was so tall, Yu had to make a platform so that the executioner could behead
Fangfeng. When Fangfeng was beheaded, the blood that spilled out was white,

not red. This abnormal phenomenon showed that Fangfeng might have been
treated wrongly. Yu thus ordered reporters to investigate the true reason for
Fangfeng’s late arrival at the meeting. They eventually told Yu that when
Fangfeng was rushing to Yu’s assembly, he encountered a local flood. He stopped
to save people from the flood and therefore came to the council very late. Yu felt
regret for having wrongly executed Fangfeng. For compensation, he then con
ferred the honorary title “Fangfeng King” on the dead and ordered a temple built
and sacrifices made to him on every August 25. The custom was maintained for
4,000 years, until the initial period of the People’s Republic of China.

FENG BO
The wind god Feng Bo helped Chiyou in a battle against Huang Di. In one ver
sion he was shot by the archer Yi. Feng means “the wind,” and bo means “the
master” (it is also a respectful title for a male elder). Feng Bo also is known as
Feng Shi (Wind Master).
There are several gods of the wind in Chinese mythology and beliefs, such
as Feng Bo (or Feng Shi), Feilian, Ji Bo (Ji refers to the Ji star), Qiongqi, Yuqiang,
and Feng Yi (Yi means “female elder”). They come from different times or differ
ent regional culture traditions, and some of them gradually become confused in
later recounts. For example, Feilian was a wind god worshiped by the Chu peo
ple in the south during the Eastern Zhou era. It was a divine bird that could
make wind. In later accounts, it is described as having a deer’s body, a sparrow’s
head with horns, a serpent’s tail, and the markings of a panther. Unlike Feilian,
Ji Bo was an ancient wind god worshiped by the central people. Its function was
rooted in the early belief that the Ji star managed the wind. Both Feilian and Ji
Bo were identified as Feng Bo in at least the Han dynasty. Another wind god,
Feng Yi, appeared in texts as late as the Tang dynasty, and he was sometimes
also called Feng Bo. Thereafter he was somehow turned into a female goddess in
later literature and customs.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 113



Feng Bo appeared as early as the Warring States era. In a text from Hanfeizi
(written by Han Fei, ca. 280–233 BC), Feng Bo is depicted as a subordinate god of
Huang Di. When Huang Di assembled the deities and ghosts on Mount Tai, he
was surrounded by many retinues. Elephants and dragons pulled the cart for
him, the divine bird Bifang accompanied him, Chiyou led the way, Feng Bo
cleaned the road, Yu Shi (the Rain Master) created sprinkles of rain along the
way, tigers and wolves ran ahead, and deities and ghosts followed him. However,
later Feng Bo rebelled against Huang Di. When Chiyou attacked Huang Di, he
asked Feng Bo and Yu Shi to help him, so they released a storm. But Huang Di
ordered the drought goddess Ba to descend from heaven, and the rain was
stopped. The defeated Chiyou was killed by Huang Di. The text does not men
tion how Feng Bo and Yu Shi were treated after the battle.
Some other Feng Bo myths link him to the hero Yi. Since Feng Bo was
known to have destroyed men’s houses, Yi shot him in his knees. In another ver
sion, Yi stopped Feng Bo from damaging houses by shooting him at the Qinqiu
Marsh. In one version, Yi killed Feng Bo.
Feng Bo’s appearance varied greatly among different accounts. In a text of
the Yuan dynasty, he was described as having the head of a dog, red hair, the
shape of a ghost, the hips of a panther, and red trousers, and he stood on a cloud
and carried on his back a sack full of wind. In the Qing dynasty, however, he was
often portrayed as an old man with a white beard, and he always carried the
wind sack in his hand and directed the wind coming from the sack in any direc
tion he chose.

FLOODS, THE
Flood is a worldwide mythical theme. It is especially popular in Chinese mythol
ogy, as Derk Bodde described: “Of all the mythical themes of ancient China, the
earliest and by far the most pervasive is that of flood” (Bodde 1961, 398). Chinese
flood myths usually tell about how the flood in ancient times imperiled the world,

and therefore how the heroes or heroines tried to stop the flood and save the world
from the disaster; or how human ancestors tried to re-create human races, and
eventually how a new cosmic order is rebuilt and a new civilization appears.
Generally, there are three systems of flood myths in Chinese mythology (Lu
2002, 18). The first one relates to the theme “controlling the flood,” and it in
cludes many famous classical myths, such as stories of the god Gonggong caus
ing a flood, the goddess Nüwa patching the sky with colorful stones and accu
mulating the reed ashes to stop the flood, the god Gun stealing Xirang (the
self-growing soil) to dam the flood, and Yu channeling the floodwater into the
sea and eventually stopping the flood and making the world fit for cultivation.
All these myths can be found in texts of the Zhou dynasty. Among them, the
Gun-Yu myth is the most representative one in the sense that it intensively
stresses how the flood eventually is controlled by great efforts from two genera
tions. It should be added to Bodde’s conclusion that these flood myths belong
not only to ancient China but are still told in contemporary China as well.
The second system deals with the brother-sister marriage myth, in which a
world flood destroyed all of the human beings except a brother and his sister (fa
ther and daughter or aunt and nephew in some versions). The surviving siblings
had to marry each other to repopulate the human races, because they could not
find other partners. After they got married, they bore normal children or, more
often, abnormal babies such as a spherical piece of flesh, a gourd, a melon, or a
knife-grinding stone. The “abnormal fetuses” somehow turned into humankind
when they were cut into pieces, or when they were opened, humans appeared.
This type of myth often serves as an etiological myth about the origin and char
acter of human races or certain ethnic groups. It can be found in writings as late
as the Six Dynasties, yet it is hard to correspondingly conclude that this type of
myth emerged that late in oral tradition. Today it is still one of the most popular
myths in China and is told in more than forty ethnic groups throughout the
country (Chen 1996).
The third system is more like a local legend than a myth. It usually links
with a local flood that sank a city and destroyed all the people except a single
kind one. The typical plot of this story is like this: A good-hearted person (an old
lady, a dutiful son, etc.) was told by a god that the city she/he lived in would
sink and turn into a lake soon. If she/he found the eyes of a stone lion (some
times a turtle) turning red, she/he should run away at once. So every day she/he
went to see whether the lion’s eyes had turned red. A butcher man felt curious
when he learned what this person was doing. So the next day he deliberately
wiped some blood on the stone lion’s eyes as a joke. When the old lady or dutiful
son saw the red eyes of the lion, she/he rushed up a mountain. While others
were laughing at her/him, the city began to sink, and it soon turned into a lake.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 115



This type of legend also can be found in accounts from the Zhou dynasty,
and it is usually used to describe the mythical birth of a great man or to explain
the origin of a certain lake. For example, Yiyin, the important politician in the
Shang dynasty, was said to be born from a hollow mulberry tree that was trans
formed from his mother. The mother was the sole survivor of the local flood,
but when she turned around to see what had happened to her city—which broke
the divine forbiddance—she was turned into a hollow mulberry tree.
However, this legend later became connected to the brother-sister marriage
myth, and thus the local flood became a worldwide disaster. In Henan Province
in central China, the flood is usually said to be a part of a cosmic disaster, which
is often depicted as “the sky collapsed and the earth sank.” A myth collected in
1982 in Nanyang County says that in the remote past, there were two sibling
students, a brother and his elder sister. There was a temple near their school
with an iron lion standing in front of it. The siblings liked to ride the lion for
fun. One day, a monk told the siblings that they should feed the iron lion every
day with steamed bread. They followed his suggestion. After a period of time,
the monk told them that they should pay attention to the lion’s eyes, and when
the eyes became red, they should get into the lion’s stomach. One day, when the
sister fed the lion again, she found that the lion’s eyes had turned red, so she and
her younger brother got into the lion’s stomach. Then they saw the sky become
dark, and heard the wind blowing fiercely with a loud crash. When it became
bright again, they climbed out and found that the sky had collapsed and all the
other people were dead. They subsisted on the steamed breads in the lion’s
stomach and hoped to find a house in which to live. On a mountain, they found
an old lady (her status was unclear in the story). They asked her what they
should do after the near extinction of all humans. The old lady suggested that
they roll one piece of a millstone down the mountain, and if the piece happened
to cover another piece of the millstone at the foot of the mountain, they should
marry each other. Eventually the two pieces came together, and the siblings got
married. Soon they bore five boys and five girls, and these siblings married each
other too. Thereafter human beings became plentiful and populated this world.
The flood myth is by no means uniquely Chinese, for it is widely found
among other peoples of East and Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, India Islands,
New Guinea, Polynesia, Micronesia, the Americas, and many other places. How
ever, compared to the biblical or other Western flood myths, the Chinese flood
myth is distinctive in some regards. The basic difference, as some scholars have
suggested, is that in the Chinese version what is emphasized is the conquest of
the flood and the origin of civilization rather than the flood that came to punish
human sin (Bodde 1961, 402–403; Lu 2002, 18–21). This characteristic is strongly
illustrated in the Gun-Yu myth. The essence of this myth is not that one should
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
116



obey God’s will and arrangement or the law of nature. Rather, the spirit is praised
for making every effort to conquer the natural disaster, no matter how arduous
the task is, in order to save humans. Eventually the demigod Yu stopped the flood
and changed the miserable world into a habitable place for humankind. He then
became the founder of the first civilized state, Xia. Similarly, the emphasis of the
brother-sister marriage myth is not on the flood itself either. The flood only func
tions as the necessary cause for the sibling incest. The narrative purpose is to ex
plain how humankind was re-created after the cosmic disaster and how a new
world order was rebuilt. In some versions, after the repopulation of human be
ings, the stories also tell how the new descendents get grain seeds or fire, and
thereafter start an agricultural civilization. So, as recent research insists, the mo
tifs of “controlling the flood” and “acquisition of the agricultural civilization”
contained in the Chinese flood myth make it unique (Lu 2002, 18–19).

FUSANG
Fusang (literally meaning “Leaning Mulberry”) is a world-tree in the east where
the ten suns stay, bathe, and rise. It is also known as Fumu (Leaning Tree).
The world-tree is a common mythical motif found in many countries and
among numerous ethnic groups. It is usually described in various mythologies as
a huge divine tree that links earth with heaven and communicates the human
and profane condition to the divine and sacred realm. Among its many parallels
in Europe, Australia, North America, and other areas, Fusang is one of the most
famous Chinese world-trees. According to texts from Shanhaijing, Fusang grew
in the water of the Tang Valley. The tree was very high; its trunk reached 300 li
(100 miles) in height, and its leaves were like the leaves of the mustard plant. The
ten suns stayed on the tree and bathed in the valley. Nine of them stayed on the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 117



lower branches of Fusang while the sun that was going to rise stayed on its top
branch. The ten suns rose from the Fusang tree one by one. As soon as one sun
came back from crossing the sky, another sun went up. Each sun was carried by a
crow. In an account from Huainanzi, the sun is said to rise from the Yang Valley
(the same as the Tang Valley) and be bathed in the Xian Pool. When the sun
swept past Fusang it was called First Dawn. When it climbed up Fusang and was
prepared to begin its journey, it was called Daybreak.
In some later versions, Fusang is described as a large tree in the east. Its top
reached heaven while its trunk curved down and reached the Three Springs of
the earth. However, according to Shizhouji (A Record of Ten Mythic Islets, said
to have been written during the Han dynasty but probably written in the Six Dy
nasties era), Fusang seemed to be not only a kind of tree but also a mythical
place that was located in the middle of the Blue Sea. It was thousands of miles in
circumference with a palace for an immortal built on it. Fusang trees grew here.
Their leaves were like those of the mulberry, and they also produced the same
fruit. The biggest one of them was more than 100,000 feet high and 2,000 wei
wide (one wei is equal to the diameter of a circle created by a person’s arms).
Since the trees grew in pairs, every pair of them shared the same root and their
trunks leaned toward each other; therefore they received the name “Leaning
Mulberry.” Though the trees were extremely large, their fruits were rare, be
cause the trees produced fruit only once every 9,000 years. The fruit was red,
and it tasted very sweet and savory. When the immortals ate the fruit, their bod
ies would turn a golden color, and they were able to fly and float in the air.
Other legends state that there were Heaven Chickens on the Fusang tree.
The chickens nested in the top of the mythical tree and crowed at midnight each
night. Every time they crowed, the crows inside the suns followed them. And
then all the chickens in the world would follow and crow loudly.

FUXI
Fuxi is a culture hero, a human ancestor, and one of the most powerful primeval
gods in Chinese mythology. He also may be called Paoxi or Baoxi in ancient
literature.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
118



In one version of the Fuxi myth, Fuxi was born after his mother trod in a
huge footprint in a marshland and then became pregnant. According to some an
cient written recordings and iconography, he had a human head with a snake’s
body, though he gradually became fully human and in later years was a king
with great dignity. During the Han dynasty Fuxi often became associated with
Nüwa, one of the most powerful and ancient goddesses. Nüwa’s achievements
include creating human beings by molding yellow earth together and patching
the broken sky alone, according to early written sources. Fuxi took the role of
Nüwa’s brother and husband, and Nüwa was his helper and assistant. They
often appeared together in funeral stone bas-reliefs of the Han dynasty, portrayed
with human heads or upper bodies and serpents’ or dragons’ lower bodies, some
times with their tails intertwined. Fuxi holds a pair of compasses or the sun
with a three-footed crow inside it, and Nüwa holds either a carpenter’s square or
the moon with the divine frog inside. These symbols are interpreted as repre
senting the order that Fuxi and Nüwa created subsequently by establishing the
rules of the world and the harmony of the universe between yang and yin, which
are important notions in traditional Chinese philosophy, medicine, and other
systems. Yang represents the male or positive principle in nature while yin rep
resents the feminine or negative principle.

Fuxi and Nüwa. Funeral stone carving of the Han dynasty, Wuliang Shrine, Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province. Both of them were portrayed with human heads and upper bodies and serpents’ lower bodies. Their tails intertwined. Fuxi held a pair of compasses while Nüwa held a carpenter’s square. They were surrounded by other winged divine creatures with serpent bodies. (Yang Lihui, Rethinking on the Source Area of the Cult of Nüwa, Beijing Shifan Daxue Chubanshe, 1999, 71)



During the Han dynasty, Fuxi was confused with another god, Taihao, who
appeared as an independent divinity in pre-Han sources. Tai means “great” or
“supreme,” and hao means “expansive and limitless.” Therefore, Fuxi not only
received the honorary name of Taihao but also took Taihao’s function as the god
who reigns over the east and controls the season of spring. The wood god,
Goumang, became his subordinate.
Most of Fuxi’s myths refer to Fuxi inventing cultural items in remote antiq
uity. He gained the reputation of inventor, and is given credit for many impor
tant innovations. From these inventions he achieved status as one of the great
est culture heroes in China. One of his famous inventions, for example, was the
Eight Trigrams (Ba Gua, the eight possible combinations of three whole or bro
ken lines, used in Chinese divination), which later also became very important
in traditional Chinese philosophy and belief. According to Zhouyi, “Xi Ci
Zhuan” (“Appended Texts” of The Classic of Change, written approximately in
the Qin and early Han eras), Fuxi carefully watched the images in the sky and on
the earth, and he thought about the patterns and colors of birds and beasts as
well as the suitability of the land. The images and patterns included not only
those of his surroundings but also those of his own body. Then he created the
Eight Trigrams in order to communicate the virtue of the divinities and to re
semble the character of everything on the earth.
Fuxi also is well-known for inventing hunting and fishing nets by imitating
the spider’s web. A modern version of the Fuxi myth, collected in Sichuan
Province in the 1960s, provides a vivid description of this inventing process.
After Fuxi and his sister re-created human beings, there were more and more peo
ple in the world. These people survived by hunting wild animals. The more they
hunted, the more they ate. If they killed nothing, then they ate nothing. People
often suffered from hunger. Fuxi felt very worried about this. He tried to solve
this serious problem. One day, he found fish jumping in a river, so he caught sev
eral big fish with his hands. He then told his children to catch and eat fish like
wise. But the ruler of the water, Dragon King, was very upset and horrified that
the humans were eating his fish. He was afraid that this would decrease the pop
ulation of his subjects. Adopting the suggestion of his prime minister, the tor
toise, the Dragon King told Fuxi that he and his children could not catch any fish
unless they could do this without using their hands. Fuxi was baffled for several
days. One day, when he was lying under a tree and thinking about the problem,
he saw a spider weaving its web and catching several insects with it. Fuxi was en
lightened by this. He wove a rattan net and put it into the river, then waited on
the shore. After a moment, he lifted the net. Lots of fish were jumping inside the
net. Fuxi was very pleased because he could catch fish much easier now without
using his hands! Soon he taught his children to follow him. The Dragon King was

120



so angry that his eyes protruded from his head from then on. The prime minister
tortoise wanted to flatter its king with another idea. But when it crept onto the
shoulder of the Dragon King, it was slapped by the king and fell down into an ink
plate. That is the reason why the tortoise is black today.
In addition, Fuxi had many other mythical functions. He established the
marriage rule. This rule required a young man to give his fiancée two deer skins
as an engagement gift. He made some musical instruments, such as the se (a
twenty-five-stringed plucked instrument, somewhat similar to the zither) and
the xun (an egg-shaped clay wind instrument with finger holes), and composed
the melody of “Jia Bian.”
He raised livestock and reined cattle and horses to draw carts and carry
heavy goods. He smelted metal and made numerous material objects and tools.
He taught people to barbecue food and to pound grain with a mortar and pestle.
Fuxi also made cloth and began to rear silkworms. He made coins of copper. He
invented written characters for people to record life instead of remembering
events by making special knots in cords. He also invented the calendar and
laws.
Because he had so many cultural inventions important for human life, he
was respected as the first of the Three Divine Sovereigns, along with Nüwa and
Shennong, or the Divine Farmer (different names are given in different texts). In
a rationalized system of Chinese ancient history, which was primarily formed in
the Han dynasty, he was even respected as the first king of the remote past.
In modern Chinese mythology, however, Fuxi is best known as an ancestor
of humans. He married his sister and re-created human beings after a great flood.
This type of brother-sister marriage myth is widely spread throughout the coun
try, especially in southern and central China. The first couple may only be
called “a brother and his sister” rather than by the names Fuxi and Nüwa, or
they may take different names in different places and ethnic groups. In some
cases they have the title “Fuxi and his sister” or simply “Fuxi and Nüwa.”
Therefore, Fuxi is known in his first marriage as a human creator to many eth
nic groups, including the Han, Miao, Yao, Tujia, Maonan, and Shui.
Fuxi is still worshiped in modern China. Huaiyang County in Henan
Province is said to be the capital of King Taihao Fuxi’s mythical kingdom and
the hometown of Fuxi (Fuxi is said to have been born in Huaiyang). In Huaiyang
there is a big temple complex called the Tomb of Taihao, or, more popularly,
Renzu Temple (Temple of Human Ancestors). The main god worshiped here is
Fuxi. Nüwa is also worshiped here, but her hometown is said to be Xihua, in a
nearby county.
Renzu Temple in Huaiyang has a long history. One of the famous legends
about its reconstruction refers to Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the Ming
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 121



dynasty (whose reign lasted from 1368 to 1398). Zhu was chased by his enemies
before he ascended the throne of the kingdom, so he hid in Renzu Temple and
prayed to Fuxi. He promised Fuxi he would rebuild this rough temple if the an
cestor blessed him and protected him from his chasers. Thousands of spiders
soon appeared and began to weave webs on the temple door. In minutes the door
was covered by cobwebs and looked as if nobody had ever entered the temple.
This fooled Zhu’s enemies, and they left the temple grounds. Zhu was thus res
cued, and he later became the founder of the Ming dynasty. As emperor, Zhu or
dered that the temple be reconstructed similar to the structure of his palace.
That is why the temple complex looks so grand today.
From February 2 to March 3 in the lunar calendar, the monthlong Renzu
Festival is held to celebrate Fuxi’s birthday at the Renzu Temple complex. The
festival draws thousands of pilgrims daily from nearby villages, counties, and
provinces. They come here for many different purposes: to make supplications
to the ancestors; to thank the ancestors for fulfilling their supplications; or to
pray for children, happiness, health, wealth, or countless other things, such as

entrance into college. The pilgrims, especially women, may dance the danjing
tiao (a local dance in which women carry a pole on their shoulders), or sing
jingge (classic songs, a type of folk song) to commemorate and praise the ances
tors. As for the contents, many jingge not only tell the myths of their remote
creators but also often end with a moral or propagation. The following is the text
of a jingge that Yang Lihui recorded in her fieldwork in Huaiyang in 1993:
Remember the beginning of the world is chaos,
Without sky, without earth, without Human beings.
Then, the deity of sky created the sun, the moon, and the stars,
Then, the deity of earth created the grain and grass.
Having the sky and earth, the chaos separated,
Thus appeared Renzu, the brother and sister.
They climbed to the high mountain Kunlun,
To throw the millstone and get married.
They gave birth to hundreds of children,
That’s the origin of Baijiaxing (human beings).
Therefore, though people in this world look different,
Yet in fact they belong to the same family.
How wrong it is struggling for the wealth and fame,
Because you can’t bring them with you when you go into the grave.
I persuade you to be a good person,
Because a good person can be blessed by the Renzu on earth.
There is another interesting custom here, that of ninigou (“mud dog”),
which relates to Fuxi’s mythical deeds. Ninigou refers to all toys made of mud,
including monkeys, swallows, tortoises, and tigers, and it can also be the clay
musical instrument, the xun. Why do people make ninigou? The craftsmen ex
plain that this tradition originated with Fuxi, who first made the clay xun and
created humans from mud. They want to imitate the mythical activities and
thus memorialize their remote ancestors.

GONGGONG
The water god who caused a flood disaster and bumped into Mount Buzhou, giv
ing rise to cosmic disorder, Gonggong is known in some ancient texts as
Kanghui. He is often portrayed as having a man’s head with red hair, and the
body of a serpent.
The Gonggong myth appears in writings of the late Warring States era. One
question raised in the poem “Tianwen” asks, “Why did the earth tilt toward the
southeast during Kanghui’s rage?” This illustrates that the myth about Gong
gong damaging Mount Buzhou was current at that time.
In the Han dynasty and thereafter, the Gonggong myth contains much more
detail. Gonggong is said to have fought with the god Zhuanxu (or Zhurong, Di
Ku, or Shengnong; various names are given in different versions) to be the
Supreme Divinity in remote times, but he failed. In his fury he bumped against
one of the sky pillars, Mount Buzhou, and damaged it. The cords of the earth
also broke during this event. His blunder brought cosmic disruption.
This story is sometimes associated with Nüwa, the great mother of human
beings and the one who repaired the cosmos, but with considerable differences.
According to Lunheng and “Bu Shiji Sanhuang Benji” (“Biographies of the Three
Divine Sovereigns: A Supplement to the Historical Records,” written during the
Tang dynasty), the Gonggong story is followed by that of Nüwa. The recording
in “Bu Shiji Sanhuang Benji” combined various myth versions and tried to form
a coherent ancient history. Gonggong was described as a rebellious nobleman.
He became powerful by using shrewdness and punishment. He ruled with
tyranny instead of benevolence. Toward the end of Nüwa’s reign, Gonggong
fought with Zhurong, the God of Fire, but he failed. He was so angry that he
struck his head against Mount Buzhou and caused this sky pillar to collapse,
snapping the cords of the earth. To repair this damage, Nüwa melted stones of
five different colors to mend the sky. She cut the legs off a huge tortoise and set
them up to support the four corners of the sky. Then she collected ashes of reeds
to stop the flood. Through her effort, Nüwa cleared up the chaos and put the
world in order again. However, in texts from Liezi and Bowuzhi (A Treatise on
Research into Nature, written during the Jin dynasty), the chronological order of
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
124



these two stories is reversed. That is, Nüwa repaired a defect in the cosmos first,
and later Gonggong fought with the god Zhurong and upset the normal estab
lished order. Gonggong’s damage often served as an etiological myth of the cur
rent Chinese topography. Since then, heaven tilts toward the northwest, and
that is why the sun, moon, and stars move in that direction. Earth sinks toward
the southeast, and that is why the rivers of China flow toward the ocean in the
east. The loose connection between these two stories suggests that they might
have been independent of each other in early stages of the myths and were
loosely combined in later development.
Gonggong is not only the destroyer of the sky pillar and cords of the earth
but also plays a chief role in a disastrous flood. A text from Guoyu (Discourses
of the States, from the Spring and Autumn era), for example, states that in an
cient times Gonggong abandoned the right way. He wanted to damage the world
by damming the rivers, reducing the high land, and blocking up the low land.
But the heavens did not give him good fortune, and ordinary people refused to
help him. Disasters and disorders spread everywhere. Therefore Gonggong was
ruined at last. In another version, from Huainanzi (chapter 8), the Gonggong
story is linked with that of the mythical sovereigns Shun and Yu. In Shun’s
time, Gonggong created a flood that swept near the place of Kongsang. At that
time, the mountains Longmeng (meaning “Dragon Gate”) and Lüliang did not
open up and hence blocked the channels. So the flood spread everywhere, and
rivers throughout the land joined together. People had to climb the mountains
and trees to escape from the vast deluge. Then Shun ordered Yu to dredge the
rivers and lakes, open up the waterways, and channel the flood to the east sea.
As a result, the flood ran out and the world became dry, and people became set
tled again.
After his failure, Gonggong came to a sticky end. One version of the myth
states that he was killed by the god Zhuanxu because he created the flood disas
ter. Other versions state that he was killed by Di Ku or Yao because of his tyran
nical and conceited domination. A popular story says that he was banished by
Yu when Yu brought an end to the flood. But other variants state that Gonggong
was exiled to the place of Youzhou by Shun or, in another version, by Yao be
cause Yao wanted to give the throne to Shun but Gonggong opposed this.

GOUMANG
The wood god and the inventor of the luo (a net for catching birds), Goumang is
the descendant of Shaohao, the god who reigns over the western region, but he
somehow assists Fuxi (also called Taihao) to reign over the eastern region and
the spring season. However, in some versions, “Goumang” is a title for the offi
cer of wood, instead of being a special deity.
Goumang often appears with a bird’s body and a human face that is square
shaped, and he wears white and rides upon two dragons. He is said to be the off
spring of the god Shaohao, and his name is Zhong (different from the god Zhong
who separated the heaven from the earth). He assists Fuxi, who takes wood as
the emblem of his reign, to rule the eastern region and the season of spring. Both
Goumang and Fuxi hold compasses in their hands. When Goumang died, he be
came the God of Wood.
A legend about Goumang from Mozi (written mainly by the philosopher Mo
Di, ca. 468–376 BC) suggests that Goumang may also function as the God of Life.
The legend states that Zhengmugong, the Duke Mu of the Zheng state, was a
man of virtue. One time when he was in the temple during the day, there came a
god with a bird’s body and a square face, wearing white. The duke was horrified
and wanted to run away. Then the god said, “Do not be afraid. The Supreme Di
vinity ordered me to add nineteen years to your life as an award for your virtue.
We hope you will make your state prosperous, with descendants flourishing. Do
not lose your state.” The duke kowtowed to the god and asked who he was. The
god answered: “I am Goumang.” In some versions the duke is said to be Qinmu
gong (the Duke Mu of the Qin state).
As noted previously, the name “Goumang” seems sometimes only a title for
the official of wood (Muzheng) instead of a certain deity. A text from Zuozhuan
shows that “Goumang” is the title for the Muzheng (Official of Wood), and this
title was assumed by one of Shaohao’s uncles named Zhong (different from the
deity Zhong who separated heaven from the earth with another deity, Li).

GUN
Gun is a popular culture hero in Chinese mythology. He stole Xirang, the self
growing soil, from the Supreme Divinity in order to stop the flood, but failed in
his mission and was killed by the God of Fire, Zhurong, at Mount Yushan. His
corpse turned into a yellow bear and dove into the pool of Yuyuan. His son Yu
was miraculously born from the belly of his corpse and continued to fight the
flood until he succeeded.
Gun is said to be a descendant of Huang Di. Though there are slim accounts
describing his image, the written character for his name (j, which includes the
radical k, which means “fish”) reveals that his figure might have originally been
a fish. His myth is mainly recorded in the two written classics of Chinese
mythology, Shanhaijing and “Tianwen.” According to a text from Shanhaijing
(chapter 18) and the annotations of it by Guo Pu (276–324 CE) and Yuan Ke
(1916–2001), there was a flood in ancient times. It was so fierce that it gushed up
into the sky. Gun wanted to stop the flood, so he stole Xirang from the Supreme
Divinity without waiting for his permission. Xirang was a kind of mythical soil
that was able to grow ceaselessly by itself. If it was excavated, it would grow
more. Gun used it as a barricade against the overflowing water. The Supreme
Divinity was angry, so he ordered the fire god Zhurong to kill Gun at the out
skirts of Yushan (which literally means “Feather Mountain”). Gun’s corpse was
not tampered with for three years. Then, when his belly was opened with a
sword, his son Yu emerged. The Supreme Divinity then commanded Yu to
spread Xirang to control the floodwater and stabilize the world.
Comparatively, the Gun myth is more detailed in “Tianwen.” Though in
this text the myth is described in question form and hence it inevitably appears
fragmented and sometimes vague, it gives many details of the Gun myth. The
following is a translation of this text.
If Gun was not able to control the flood,
Why did the others recommend him?
They all said: “Don’t worry!
Why not let him try and then see whether he can restrain it?”
When the sparrow hawk and turtle joined together (and offered strategies),
Why did Gun accept their suggestions?
He obeyed everybody’s advice to stop the flood,
Why did the Supreme Divinity kill him?
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 127



His corpse was abandoned at Yushan,
Why did it not rot for three years?
When his belly was opened up, his son Yu emerged,
How could this miraculously happen? . . .
He was imprisoned at Yushan and was not allowed to go west,
How did he surmount those lofty and precipitous peaks?
He metamorphosed to a yellow bear after his death,
How could those magicians revive him?
He told people to plant black millet,
And to grow cattail and reed.
He had done so much for people,
But why was he rejected, and thus considered a notoriety forever?
From this text, we may infer that when Gun tried to control the flood, he
adopted the suggestions of the sparrow hawk and turtle. It could have been they
who suggested that Gun steal Xirang from the Supreme Divinity. After Gun was
executed and gave birth to Yu from the belly of his corpse, he turned into a yel
low bear. Then he managed to climb over the high mountains to the west and
ask the powerful shamans to bring him back to life. In other versions he is said
to have turned into a yellow dragon, a yellow turtle with three legs, or a black
fish. Then he dove into the Yuyuan (which literally means “Feather Pool”).
A legend recorded in the Jin dynasty states that after his failure to control
the flood, Gun committed suicide by sinking into the Yuyuan. He then turned
into a black fish, which often raised its feeler, shook its scales, and lay crosswise
in the waves. People who saw it said it was the spirit of the river. Fishermen
built Gun’s temple on Mount Yushan and offered sacrifices to him throughout
the year. Another version written in the Six Dynasties era states that after Gun
was executed by Yao at Yushan, he metamorphosed into a yellow bear and dove
into the Yuquan (Yu Spring). Thus, when the Guiji people (in modern Zhejiang
Province) make offerings at Yu Temple, they do not give bears as sacrifices.
Other myths about Gun can be found in early sources such as Shujing (Book
of History, ca. tenth century BC) and Lüshi Chunqiu (Annals of Master Lü, third
century BC), but these sources have a tendency to historicize or interpret each
story. In the Shujing Gun was depicted as opinionated and destructive. This
source states that in ancient times, the flood brought great damage to the world.
The water reached the sky, and people suffered from it. So Di, the Supreme Di
vinity, asked the gods of the Four Mountains to suggest someone who might be
able to stop the flood. The four gods recommended Gun. But the Supreme Divin
ity was hesitant to use him because he thought Gun was a conceited man who
would only damage the human species. Since the four gods urged Di to let Gun
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
128



try, the Supreme Divinity finally sent Gun to stop the flood. But nine years later,
Gun still had not succeeded. Another story from Lüshi Chunqiu describes Gun
as a nobleman who competed against Yao for power. The sage king Yao wanted
to give his throne to Shun. Gun felt that this was unfair because he thought he
himself should be one of the Three Dukes. So he rebelled against Yao and Shun.
It is said that when he was angry, he was even more ferocious than a wild ani
mal. In the wilderness, Gun led a group of beasts. If the beasts’ horns were put
together, they could form a big wall. And if Gun raised his tail, it looked like a
flag. In this way he evaded the strengths of Yao and Shun, and Gun wandered in
the wilderness worrying about Shun getting the throne. He was later executed at
Yushan, his belly cut open with a sword produced in Wu.
Besides being a fallen hero who failed at damming up the flood, Gun is said
to be the culture hero who first tamed cattle and invented the plow (lei and si)
and introduced city walls. One interpretation states that he built the inner wall
of the city to protect the ruler and the outer wall to guard the common people.
The Gun story told in contemporary China usually appears as a mixture of
related myths and other mythical themes and motifs; its plot often is compli
cated. Gun often is set in an orderly pantheon that formed late. Furthermore, de
spite his failure and tragic death, Gun often is described in popular literature and
folk belief as a respectful hero who tried to save the world and its people. One
legend collected in the 1980s in central Sichuan Province explains the origin of
the Yellow Dragon Temple located near the headwaters of the Min River. Gun
was the grandson of Tian Di (the Emperor of Heaven). One day, he went to
Lingxiao Palace (lingxiao literally means “reach to the clouds”) to worship his
grandfather. When he passed by the south gate of the palace in the heavens, he
found there was a gap in the Milky Way and the water was flowing down onto
the earth. The world of humans was covered by a flood, and people fled to the
top of the mountains. Gun remembered that his grandfather dug here and
brought home some black mud called Xirang. This created a flaw in the river of
heaven and caused water to overflow into the human world. He knew that only
Xirang could stop the flood. So, when Gun saw his grandfather, he asked him to
put Xirang back where it belonged or scatter it directly onto the earth to stop the
water. But Tian Di did not agree with him. Gun asked again and again, and Tian
Di became impatient and drove him out of the palace. Gun then decided to steal
Xirang and save the humans, but he did not know where to find the special mud
in his grandfather’s palace. His friends, the divine swallow and turtle, told him
that Xirang was in a jade cupboard in Lingxiao Palace. Furthermore, they had a
good idea of how to go about getting the magic mud. The next day, Tian Di went
to the Grand Cold Palace on the moon to watch Chang’e dance. Gun and his two
partners tricked the heavenly guards that protected the mud and made them
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 129



drunk. Then they opened the cupboard and caught Xirang. Xirang was so heavy
that it overloaded the turtle’s shell and created several cracks. Gun and his part
ners flew to the earth and scattered the mud onto the overflowing waters. The
mud quickly began to grow, and soon there appeared mountains and dams. Peo
ple happily came down from the mountaintops and began to rebuild houses, till
the land, and sow seeds.
Tian Di was very angry when he learned of Gun’s theft. He ordered Gun, the
swallow, the turtle, and the palace guards all to be executed. After Gun was
killed at Yushan by the cruel god Zhurong, his corpse did not rot, and his eyes
remained open and his heart kept beating. Zhurong then was ordered to open
Gun’s chest. When he did so, a yellow dragon emerged from Gun’s chest and
flew toward Canglongshan (Mount Hiding Dragon) above the Min River.
Later, Gun’s son Yu grew up and continued to battle the flood. One day,
when he investigated the flooding at the Min River, he was caught by a sudden
storm and his boat was thrown back and forth by huge waves and became
caught in a whirlpool. At this critical moment, the yellow dragon appeared, dove
into the river, and carried the boat out of the whirlpool. The places the dragon
passed were each channeled, and the floodwater was confined. From then on, the
Min River had a stable channel.
Years later, a Yellow Dragon Temple was built near the headwaters of the
Min River for commemorating the meritorious yellow dragon. Every June 16,
people of many nationalities, including Tibetan, Han, and Qiang, come here to
worship the yellow dragon and pray to him for happiness.

HE BO
He Bo is the god of the Yellow River who helped Yu stop the flood by providing
him a map of the rivers’ locations. In some versions he was shot by the hero Yi
because he drowned men.

HOUJI
Houji is an important culture hero who brought varieties of grain to people and
taught them cultivating and harvesting; he was widely known as the God of
Agriculture. He was miraculously born by Jiang Yuan, the first consort of the
god Di Ku, and later became the ancestor of the Zhou people (the Zhou dynasty
dates from the eleventh century BC to 256 BC). In many historicizing biographical
materials he was set in the time of the sage kings Yao and Shun. In his name,
hou means “sovereign” or “lord” and ji means “millet.” Therefore, Houji can be
translated as “Lord Millet” or “Sovereign Millet” in English. He was also called
Qi (“the Abandoned”; this name is different from another Qi, the ancestor of the
Shang people born by Jiandi).
The Houji story appears very early in the first Chinese poetry collection,
Shijing (The Classic of Poetry, also translated as Book of Odes, compiled in or
before 500 BC). The poem “Shengmin” (“Giving Birth to Our People”) highly
praised Houji, the ancestor and founder of the Zhou, and minutely described the
process of his miraculous birth, his supernatural ability to plant, his great bene
fits to people by bringing them grains and teaching them cultivating, and the
sacrifice rite he invented and offered to God to pray for the harvest:
The first birth of [our] people,
Was from Jiang Yuan.
How did she give birth to a person?
She had offered a sacrifice to the Supreme Divinity,
To ward off the misfortune of childlessness.
By chance she stepped into a huge toe-print made by the Supreme Divinity,
and her body was stirred.
She then began to live in a separate room undisturbed.
Jiang Yuan became pregnant, and she behaved even more devoutly and
solemnly.
She gave birth to [a son],
Who was Houji.
When her pregnancy had come to full-term,
Her first-born son was delivered as easy as the birth of a lamb.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 131



His afterbirth didn’t burst,
And there was no injury to him.
It was a result of the Supreme Divinity showing his mythical power.
The Supreme Divinity was satisfied and calm,
Accepting and enjoying her offering and sacrifice,
And she easily brought forth her son.
[Scared by his abnormal conception,] Jiang Yuan abandoned her son on a nar
row lane,
But the sheep and oxen protected him and fed him.
Jiang Yuan then tried to place him in a forest,
But gave up for there happened to be many wood-cutters there.
She then threw him away on the cold ice,
And a bird sheltered and supported him with its wings.
When the bird flew away,
Houji began to wail.
His cry was so long and loud,
That his voice filled all his surroundings.
[He then was taken back home.]
When he just learned to crawl,
He looked intelligent and knowledgeable,
And was able to feed himself.
When he started to plant large beans,
The beans grew vigorously.
The paddy of millet he planted was abundant;
His hemp and wheat grew strong and thick,
His melons and gourds came in great yields.
The husbandry of Houji,
Developed the technique of helping [the crop’s growth].
He cleared away the thick weeds,
And sowed the ground with fine seeds of grain.
The seedlings of crops were ready to burst as soon as they emerged,
And they grew up quickly,
With strong stems and plentiful ears.
Their grains were full,
And Houji had a bumper harvest.
He thus dwelt in Tai as the appointed lord.
The Supreme Divinity bestowed to him fine grains:
The black millet, and the double-kernelled;
The red, and the white.
The black and the double-kernelled millet were planted extensively,
Which made a tremendous harvest.
The red and white millet were planted extensively,
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
132



And there was need for many people to carry it on their shoulders and backs at
the harvest.
Being home, he offered sacrifices to the Supreme Divinity.
And how as to the sacrifices?
Some hull the grain, some take it from the mortar;
Some tread it, some winnow it.
It is rattled as it is washed in the dishes,
And the steam emanates as it is distilled.
We consulted seriously about the rites.
We burn southernwood with the fat;
We sacrifice a ram to the Spirit of the path,
Offering roast and broiled flesh,
We pray for a more wonderful coming year.
The offerings are loaded in the wood stands,
And fill the earthenware stands.
As soon as the fragrance ascends,
The Supreme Divinity will receive all the offerings with pleasure;
They are so fragrant and in their peak season.
Houji created the sacrifice rites,
By which to pray for absolution and fortune.
This has lasted through the present day.
Similar stories can be found in later writings. For example, in the chapter
“The Basic Annals of Zhou” in Shiji, the exemplary historical book written in
the early ages of the Western Han dynasty, the Houji story was narrated, clearly
based on the poem above, but with some historicization. Houji became the sub
ordinate of Yao and Shun. It said that Houji of the Zhou named Qi. His mother,
Jiang Yuan, is the daughter of the Youtai clan. Jiang Yuan is the first consort of
Di Ku. When she went out into a field one day, she saw a huge footprint. She
was very curious and pleased and so she stepped in it. As soon as she did this,
there was a movement in her body as if she had become pregnant. She bore a son
in due time. However, since Jiang Yuan’s motherhood of this child was miracu
lous, she considered the baby to be something inauspicious, so she threw it
away in a narrow alley. When the oxen and sheep passed the alley, they all de
toured to avoid stepping on the baby. Jiang Yuan next attempted to throw it into
a forest, but she happened to meet many people in the forest. Jiang Yuan threw it
again on the ice, but the birds covered and warmed it with their wings. Jiang
Yuan thought Houji must be a god, so she brought the child home and raised it.
Because she wanted to abandon it in the beginning, she named it Qi (“the Aban
doned”). When he was a child, he was very ambitious. He liked to plant hemp
and cereals as a game, and they grew very well. When he grew up, he liked to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 133



sow and cultivate. He conducted research and found the lands fit for grain, and
there he sowed grain seeds. People all followed him. When Yao learned of his ex
traordinary specialty, he chose him to be the Master of Farming. Thus the whole
world received benefits from Houji. Later Shun told him to sow grain in order to
save people from hunger. At the place called Tai, Shun honored him and gave
him the name Houji.
Like many deities in Chinese mythology and belief, Houji also died and was
buried. Even after his death, he was still associated with cereals and plants. Ac
cording to Shanhaijing (chapter 18), Houji was buried in the wilderness of
Duguang, where the Black River went through. Here grew good-tasting beans,
rice, sticky millet, and unsticky millet. There were hundreds of grains that self
seeded here and grew naturally whether it was winter or summer. Here the male
phoenix sang while the female phoenix danced freely. The tree of Lingshou (ling
means “good” or “animated,” and shou means “long life”) bore fruits and flow
ers, and grasses and trees flourished. Here hundreds of beasts lived together, and
grasses would not wither in winter and summer.
Houji enjoys a high status in the traditional pantheon in China, where agri
culture plays a key role in people’s lives and in the national economy. He is wor
shiped not only as the god of agriculture but also as the founding ancestor of
farming. For instance, in Zouping County, Shandong Province, Houji was said to
be the first to teach farmers how to cultivate and harvest crops. He was offered
sacrifices in the temple every July 15 of the lunar calendar. Farmers would hang
some bad grain outside their gates on this date, by which they hoped that Houji
would teach them more about how to make the cereals grow better (Shanman et
al. 1988, 44). In Shanxi Province, especially its southern counties like Jishan,
Wenxi, Wanrong, and Yuncheng, there are many relics linked to the Houji story,
such as the Mountain of King Ji, temples of King Ji or of Ji and Yi (in which both
Houji and Boyi are worshiped), Jiang Yuan’s Mausoleum, and Ice-pool Village.
Houji is believed to have been born there, abandoned there (in the Ice-pool Vil
lage, for instance), and to have taught people cultivating there. Among the
stones on the Mountain of King Ji are some bright jadelike ones. Their shapes
are like types of cereals. Some look like the millets, some like corn, some like
sesame, some like the seeds of pumpkins or watermelons, and so on. These
stones are called “Stones of Cereals.” Local people said they are transformed
from the seeds left by Houji and Jiang Yuan after they taught sowing. They often
serve to testify to Houji’s close relationship with this area and his great contri
butions to humans.
Houji’s descendants continue to make contributions in agriculture, too. In
the same chapter of Shanhaijing, Houji’s grandson, Shujun, is said to be the in
ventor who started to till by using cattle.

HOUTU
Houtu is a shadowy figure in Chinese mythology whose gender is ambiguous.
He functions as the Deity of Earth. In some versions he is said to be the descen
dant of Yan Di, son of Gonggong, grandfather of Kuafu, and the assistant god of
Huang Di. Both Houtu and Huang Di hold cords and reign over the central part
of the world. Houtu also is sometimes described as the ruler of the netherworld.
However, Houtu’s gender is gradually described as female in later writings and
beliefs. In his name, tu means “earth” or “soil,” and hou means “divine sover
eign,” which can equally be used to address males and females.
The name Houtu appears early in Zhou writings such as Guoyu (Discourses
of the States), Zuozhuan (Chronicle of Zuo), Chuci, and the early Han accounts
such as Liji (Record of Ritual) and Huainanzi. However, in these writings
“Houtu” has several meanings and the gender it refers to is ambiguous. Some
times “Houtu” is used as a respectful title for the earth. This usage is similar to
the custom of addressing heaven as Huangtian (“Grand Heaven”). Since the earth
produces plants, fruits, and grains on which humans live, it is often regarded as a
mother figure. Accordingly, Houtu is frequently interpreted as a female (Ma
1990, 37–39; Birrell 1993, 161–162). But sometimes “Houtu” also refers to a cer
tain male god named Houtu. A text from Guoyu, for instance, states that Gong
gong possessed the world, and he had a son named Houtu. Houtu was able to
level and reclaim the ground of the world, so he was worshiped as the God of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 135



Earth. In Wang Yi’s annotations to Chuci, Houtu also functioned as the ruler of
the netherworld, Youdu (which literally means “Dark Capital”). Houtu had a ter
rible assistant named Tubo (“The Master of the Earth”) to guard the gate of
Youdu. In addition to these two meanings of the word, “Houtu” sometimes may
be used as a title for a kind of mythical official who takes charge of affairs on
earth. According to a text from Zuozhuan, the title for the Tuzheng (Official of
Earth) was “Houtu,” namely “She” (the deity of the earth), and this title was as
sumed by Gonggong’s son, named Goulong. In another version from Huainanzi,
Yu became She after he died of exhaustion in his work controlling the great flood.
Gao You wrote that Yu was worshiped as Houtu after his death.
In spite of these variants, Houtu regularly appeared as a female earth deity in
later developments, at least after the Sui dynasty. She often is respectfully ad
dressed as Madame Houtu or God
dess Houtu in folk religion and popu
lar literature. Many temples are
dedicated to her. In Wanrong County,
Shanxi Province, for example, there
is a Houtu temple. According to local
documents, this temple was first
built in the early Han dynasty thanks
to the distinguished Emperor Wu.
Thereafter, from the Han through
the Song dynasties, there were more
than ten emperors who went there to
offer sacrifices to Houtu. In this
place Houtu is popularly called
“Houtu the Sacred Mother,” and she
is portrayed as a graceful and poised
queen wearing a coronet, silk cape,
and skirt with embroidered phoe
nixes on it (in Chinese tradition, the
phoenix is often used as a symbol of
the queen or empress). She is said to
have been born on March 18 of the
lunar calendar, so a temple fair com
memorates her on this day each year.
On April 19, 2003 (lunar March 18),
the local government sponsored a
large Houtu Temple Fair (the official
title that year was “The First Houtu

Tourism Culture Festival”) in order to exploit Houtu as a “Culture Resource” to
propagate the rich local culture, attract more travelers and traders, and therefore
develop the local economy. Houtu functions as more than a Deity of Earth in the
local belief system. Like most mythical gods in Chinese folk belief, Houtu is an
almighty goddess in the pantheon. People offer her sacrifices and pray to her for
harvest, rain, children, health, wealth, safety when boating in the Yellow River,
and the tide when a boat is stranded. In local legends, Houtu often is depicted as a
kind, wise, and powerful goddess. One story says she helped Yu solve his problem
in channeling the flood to the sea. When Yu channeled the Yellow River, he
wrongly opened it toward the west. Because the rocks and stones in the west were
extremely hard, his work progressed very slowly. As he worked, Yu felt worried
because the flood season would soon come. When Houtu the Sacred Mother heard
this news, she drew a map of the Yellow River and thought over possible solu
tions. Then she had an idea. She ordered one of her divine birds to tell Yu that he
should open the channel eastward. Yu took her suggestion and finally succeeded
in directing the floodwater toward the east sea. The place where he wrongly
dredged later received the name “River Wrongly Opened.” At another time,
Houtu visited Yu and was sympathetic about his bad living conditions. She used
her great power and in minutes made a huge cave for Yu and his helpers to live in.
To thank Houtu, Yu suggested naming this cave “the Sacred Mother’s Cave.” But
Houtu was modest; she thought Yu brought more benefits to the world, so she in
sisted the cave be named “King Yu’s Cave.” Furthermore, Houtu learned that Yu
was unable to supply enough food for his workers, so she and her daughter cooked
a large pot of rice gruel every day for the hardworking laborers. No matter how
much the laborers took, the pot of gruel was never emptied. The place where
Houtu and her daughter cooked was later called “Rice Gruel Temple.” In another
story, Houtu is described as a heroine who drove off a harmful ogre. A turtle ogre
that lived in the Fen River in Shanxi Province often took humans as its food. To
eliminate the evil creature, Houtu the Sacred Mother transformed into a man who
chopped firewood on the riverbank. The ogre soon found him and rose up from the
bottom of the river to eat the man. Houtu then showed her true self and repri
manded the ogre for its evil behavior. The ogre knew that it would be punished by
the Sacred Mother, so it fled. But it ran into another deity named Juling and was
kicked by him into the Yellow River. Houtu arrived soon after and affixed it in the
center of the river. The huge turtle shell then turned into a large island, which is
now known as “Chicken-heart-shaped Beach.”

HUANG DI
Huang Di, or the Yellow Emperor, is one of the most renowned legendary figures
in Chinese mythology and culture. He is the son of Shaodian, the half brother of
Yan Di, and the forebear of some ethnic groups and many notable deities. He is
also the most important of the Five August Emperors (names differ in different
texts). He defeated Yan Di, Chiyou, and other deities and became the most pow
erful ruler of the central part of ancient China in mythical history. In later tradi
tion he is highly respected as a common ancestor of all Chinese people. Addi
tionally, he is depicted as a great culture hero by inventing almost all of the
necessary cultural items in ancient times. In some descriptions he functions as
the Thunder God. In his name, huang means “yellow,” and di means “em
peror”; therefore he may be called the Yellow Emperor in some English transla
tions. He is also named Xuanyuan.
Huang Di’s name was already quite popular in written texts during the War
ring States era. From then on, he became more and more prominent in Chinese
myths, legends, beliefs, and political lives, and hence diverse versions of stories
are told about him.
According to a text from Shizi (written in the Warring States era, but now
preserved only in later collections), Huang Di is portrayed as a human being
with four faces. Another version describes his miraculous birth. His mother,
Fubao, saw a great bolt of lightning one night circling one of the stars in the
Great Bear. (In traditional Chinese belief, astronomical phenomena are often
connected with special and momentous events of the world. The eclipse, the
brightness or dimness of the stars, the falling of meteors, and the unusual inter
action between stars and planets are taken as the signs of the birth or death of a
great man, or the prosperity or decline of a dynasty.) It was so bright that it lit up
the area nearby. Then Fubao became pregnant, and after twenty-five months she
gave birth to Huang Di. A text from Dadai Liji (The Elder Dai’s Records of Rit
ual, ca. first century BC) describes that when Huang Di was just born, he was
smart; when he was a baby, he could talk; when he was a child, he was quick;
when he grew up, he was honest and clever; when he was an elder, he was wise.
In some writings, Huang Di was 300 years old when he died.

In writings of the Warring States era
and the Han dynasty, Huang Di often ap
pears as the ruler of the central part of the
world. A text from Huainanzi (chapter 3)
sets Huang Di and the other four divine
emperors in an orderly pantheon distrib
uted in five directions (east, south, west,
north, and center) and five elements (wood,
fire, metal, water, and earth; in traditional
Chinese philosophy, the whole world is
made of these five elements). It says that
the east belongs to wood. Its god is Taihao.
His subordinate is Goumang. Both of them
hold the compasses and control the season
of spring. The south belongs to fire. Its god
is Yan Di. His subordinate is Zhuming.
Both of them hold the beams of steelyards
and control the season of summer. The
center belongs to earth. Its god is Huang
Di. His subordinate is Houtu. Both of them
hold the ropes and control the four direc
tions. The west belongs to metal. Its god is
Shaohao. His subordinate is Rushou. Both
of them hold the carpenter’s squares and
control the season of autumn. The north
belongs to water. Its god is Zhuanxu. His
subordinate is Xuanming. Both of them
hold the sliding weights of steelyards and
control the season of winter.
Being the most powerful ruler of the
center and the other four directions,
Huang Di enjoys high status and distinc
tion. A text from Hanfeizi (written by Han
Fei, ca. 280–233 BC) indicates that when Huang Di assembled the deities and
ghosts on Mount Tai, he was surrounded by many entourages. Elephants and
dragons pulled the cart for him, the divine bird Bifang accompanied him, Chiyou
led the way, Feng Bo cleaned the road, Yu Shi created sprinkles of rain along the
way, tigers and wolves ran ahead, and deities and ghosts followed him.
Some Chinese mythologists argue that there must have been several wars
between Huang Di and the other four divine emperors, and only after Huang Di

defeated all of them could he become the most powerful (Yuan 1996, 105). Ac
cording to a text written in the Three Kingdoms era (which now can only be
seen in later collections), at the beginning of Huang Di’s era he cared about cul
tivating his temperament and loved his people. He did not like war at all. But
the other four emperors boasted about their own directions and colors. (The east
belongs to wood, so its color is therefore green; the south belongs to fire, so its
color is red; the west belongs to metal, with the color white; and the north,
water, has the color black. The center belongs to earth, with the color yellow;
therefore Huang Di is called Yellow Emperor.) They conspired to attack Huang
Di. Huang Di’s soldiers were so concentrated on preparing for the fight that they
did not remove their armor. Huang Di sighed and said, “If the ruler on high is in
danger, his people will suffer from instability; if the ruler loses his kingdom, his
subordinates will have to serve another country. Now I am a ruler on high, but
the four emperors attack me and put my army on constant alert. How can I bear
this situation?” So he went to the fortified walls and commanded the army him
self. In the end, he defeated the four emperors.
Though Huang Di is often depicted in later tradition as a peaceable and
benevolent ruler, he fought with various mythological deities. Thus, he is some
times interpreted as “a warrior-god” (Birrell 1993, 130). The most well-known
wars perhaps are the ones between Huang Di and Yan Di, and between Huang Di
and Chiyou.
Yan Di is the half brother of Huang Di, the god of the south. In a text from
Xinshu (New Documents, written by a Han dynasty writer, Jia Yi, 201–168 BC),
Yan Di is said to have controlled half of the world while Huang Di controlled the
other half. Huang Di ruled his kingdom based on benevolence and love, but Yan
Di did not follow these principles. Thus they fought at the open plain of Zhuolu
(which now belongs to modern Hebei Province). The battle was so fierce and
brutal that the victims’ blood flowed like a stream that could float the pestles.
At last Huang Di killed Yan Di and took his land. The world then became peace
ful. In another version, from Liezi, when Huang Di fought against Yan Di in the
countryside of Banquan, he ordered black bears, grizzly bears, wolves, panthers,
cougars, and tigers to be his vanguards, while the eagles, fighting pheasants, fal
cons, and phoenixes were his banners. Another Huang Di myth states that the
battle between the two brothers lasted for a long time. Huang Di fought against
his brother many times before finally winning the war.
The battle between Huang Di and Chiyou seems much fiercer and larger in
scale. Chiyou is the descendant of Yan Di. In some accounts he is said to have
eighty brothers (seventy-one brothers in another version), each with an animal
body, bronze head, and iron forehead, speaking a human language. They used
sand and stone as their food. Other versions state that Chiyou had a human

140



body, horned head, ox hooves, four eyes, six hands, and ears and temples like
swords and spears. He seems to be a former subordinate of Huang Di (see the
text above from Hanfeizi), but later he somehow became a rebel. According to a
text from Shanhajing (chapter 17), Chiyou made weapons and attacked Huang
Di, so Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack against Chiyou in the
wilderness of the central plain. Yinglong began by storing all of the water.
Chiyou asked Feng Bo and Yu Shi to release a cloudburst. Then Huang Di asked
the drought goddess Ba to descend from heaven, and the rain was stopped. Even
tually Huang Di killed Chiyou.
There are many stories describing the course and circumstances of the war.
One story states that Chiyou was able to soar into the sky and surmount the
dangerous and difficult obstructions. But Huang Di made a drum from the hide
of Kui, a one-legged mythical creature, and beat it many times. The sound it
made was so great that it prevented Chiyou from flying away, and he was caught
and killed by Huang Di. Another version states that Chiyou led many ferocious
mythical animals to attack Huang Di on the Zhuolu plain. In response, Huang
Di ordered his subjects to blow horns sounding like dragons to threaten them.
Another version asserts that Chiyou could stir up clouds and mist. When he
fought with Huang Di, he made heavy fog for three days. Huang Di’s army was
caught in it and could not determine their direction. Huang Di then invented
the compass cart and guided his army out of the fog. Thus, Huang Di defeated
Chiyou and killed him. Some versions maintain that after Huang Di fought
against Chiyou many times and still could not win, he retreated with his army
to Mount Tai. There was a thick fog lasting for three days. In the fog, Huang Di
saw a lady with a woman’s head and a serpent’s body. He kowtowed, bowed
twice, flattened himself against the ground, and did not dare to stand up. The
lady said, “I am Xuan Nü [literally means ‘Dark Lady,’ a Taoist goddess in later
tradition]. What do you want to ask me?” Huang Di answered, “I hope I can get
myriad attacks, myriad wins.” So the goddess taught him the art of war, and he
defeated Chiyou in the end.
In some accounts Huang Di is said to “have fought fifty-five times and then
the whole world obeyed him.” Some Chinese historians believe that Huang Di
is a legendary clan leader in primitive China, the same as Yan Di. During the
process of their clans’ growth and expansion, Huang Di and Yan Di commanded
many battles against other clans. They ultimately became the most powerful
clan leaders in the central plain. Since their clans formed the basic part of the
Huaxia ethnic group, which later made up the main body of Han Chinese,
Huang Di and Yan Di were thus worshiped as the ancient ancestors of the Han
Chinese and, furthermore, of the whole Chinese nation. Today Han Chinese
still identify themselves as “the descendants of Huang Di and Yan Di.”
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 141



Besides these stories about Huang Di’s wars, another big cluster of Huang
Di myths refers to his many cultural inventions. In these myths he is depicted
as the fountainhead of Chinese culture and civilization. He drilled the wood for
fire, and then cooked fresh meat. By following his lead, his people did not suffer
stomach diseases from then on. He hollowed a tree trunk to make a boat and cut
branches to make oars. Therefore people could go to distant places by water. He
tamed cattle and horses to draw carts so that people could use them to carry
heavy goods. Inspired by the erigeron that could endlessly rotate in the wind, he
made the wood cart. And that is why he was also called Xuanyuan (xuan refers
to a high-fronted, curtained carriage used in ancient times, and yuan refers to
the shafts of a cart). He cut trees and used them to build a variety of houses to
protect people from wind and rain. He invented hats, crowns, and clothes. He
cut wood to make pestles, and dug earth to make mortar. He made a caldron to
steam rice. He made coins. He found the way of measuring weight, and invented
the clepsydra as a device for measuring time. He started the football game. After
he met the goddess Xiwangmu, he made twelve mirrors, and used one in each
month. So it was also Huang Di who invented the mirror. He invented coffins
for the dead. After he killed Chiyou, he buried him, and that originated the cus
tom of burial. Various myths and legends continue to attribute many inventions
and discoveries to him, such as music, writing, Chinese medicine, the art of
war, the interpretation of dreams, and astronomy. In other myth versions he is
said to have made the rules for wedding ceremonies, distributed lands and built
the country, and started rituals and markets. All in all, as an ancient writer
noted, “All of the techniques and crafts are started from Xuanyuan” (Shiwu
Jiyuan, The Origin of Items, written in the Song dynasty, chapter 7).
Among his numerous inventions, the compass cart is famed. A legend col
lected in the 1980s in Xinzheng County, Henan Province (said to be Huang Di’s
hometown), explained how Huang Di invented the compass cart. Huang Di was a
chieftain in the central plain, and Yan Di was a chieftain in the east. Admiring the
better life in the central plain, Yan Di commanded his clan to attack Huang Di’s.
Though Yan Di failed in the battle, the winner, Huang Di, wanted to ally with
him. They became sworn brothers, and their clans were united into one large
country. Meanwhile, in the southeast, there was another clan, and its leader was
Chiyou. Chiyou also coveted the prosperity of the central plain, so he ordered his
people to invade the central plain. Huang Di then commanded his army to fight
Chiyou. It was the middle of autumn, and there often was heavy fog. Having diffi
culty discerning the direction, Huang Di’s army was defeated several times.
Therefore, Huang Di spent much time in discovering a means for telling the direc
tions. At length he found that a kind of magnetite could help. He then made a
carved wooden man with a magnetite hand installed on it. No matter where he
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
142



was, the magnetite hand always pointed to the south. Therefore, Huang Di named
it Fang (“Direction”). Later Huang Di built a cart and fixed the carved man on it,
so it could easily be moved around. Huang Di called the whole system Xuanyuan
Fang. Sometime later the name was changed to “compass cart.”
In addition to these inventions directly made by Huang Di himself, many
cultural items were made by his officials, sometimes under his instructions. For
example, according to texts from Shiben, he asked Xihe to make a system for
observing the sun, Changxi to make a system for observing the moon, Yuqu to
create methods to observe the stars, Linglun to make music, Danao to compile
the Heavenly Stems and the Earthly Branches (the Ten Heavenly Stems and
Twelve Earthly Branches are used in combination to designate years, months,
days, and hours), Lishou to formulate arithmetic, Rongcheng to create the cal
endar, and Juyong and Cangjie to create writing. In other texts, his officers also
invented the mortar and pestle, boats, bows and arrows, crowns, cloth, shoes,
drums, mirrors, domesticated cattle, and other things. Even one of his four
wives, Leizu, is a famous culture heroine. She started sericulture, the cultiva
tion of silkworms and production of silk, and therefore she was worshiped as
“the Sericulture Goddess” after she died (one myth version holds that she died
while on an inspection tour with Huang Di, so Huang Di honored her as the
Road Goddess).
Huang Di has a grand family. Another wife of his, Momu, is also well
known. Though she seems not to have made any special discoveries or cre
ations, she still wins much respect. She was unsightly in appearance, but of
great virtues, so Huang Di married her and let her supervise his other concu
bines. Today some Chinese women without good looks still call themselves
“Momu,” implying that they have virtue inside.
Huang Di has many distinguished descendants, such as Gun and Yu, the
great heroes who controlled the flood; Zhuanxu, the mythical emperor; Zhong
and Li, the heroes separating heaven from earth; Shujun, the Cultivation God;
and Yuqiang, the Sea God. Huang Di also is said to have originated some ancient
ethnic groups, such as Huantou, Miaomin, and Quanrong.
Huang Di has some relationship with Taoism. During the Warring States
era, he was adopted into the Taoist philosophy and respected as a great ancient
saint who advocated silence and inaction and encouraged the worship of nature.
Later he became a god in the Taoist pantheon. Likewise, there are stories that
depict Huang Di as an immortal. Some popular legends describe how Huang Di
“ascended to heaven” at the end of his secular life. According to the historicized
descriptions of Huang Di’s life history in Shiji, Huang Di gathered copper at
Mount Shoushan. He used it to make a big ding (a tripod caldron). When the
ding had been made, a dragon with a long beard descended from heaven to meet
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 143



him. Huang Di rode on it, and more than seventy of his officials and concubines
followed him. Since there were too many lower subordinates to ride on the
dragon, they grabbed on to the dragon’s beard and were dragged along under
neath. They were so heavy that they pulled the beard out before the dragon
could ascend to heaven. Huang Di’s bow also fell. With Huang Di ascending to
heaven, people on the ground held his bow and the dragon’s beard and cried.
From then on, the place was called Ding Hu (hu means “beard”), and the bow
was called Wuhao (meaning “cry”). Some other sources suggest that Huang Di
chose his death date himself. When the day came, he said goodbye to his offi
cials. After he died, he was buried at Mount Qiao (now in Huangling County,
Shaanxi Province, in northwest China). But the mountain soon collapsed, and
his coffin was found empty except for his sword and shoes.
Today Huang Di’s myths and legends are still told in China. In Xinzheng
County, for example, nearly twenty Huang Di myths and legends were collected
from local oral tradition in the 1980s and were published in 1990. They tell vari
ous stories about Huang Di’s divine birth and marriage, his wars with Yan Di
and Chiyou, his wonderful reign over the mythical kingdom, and his ascension
to heaven. One legend explains why the local crab has ten legs rather than the
normal eight: Huang Di’s officials found a huge stone cave for their industrious
emperor to spend his summer. It was very cool inside, and there was a pond in
front of it. Huang Di was satisfied with living in the cave except that there were
groups of mosquitoes, fleas, scorpions, and mice disturbing him. He said uncon
sciously to his subordinates, “If only these disturbances could be exterminated.”
The crab living in the pond heard this and it cleared these pests away. When
Huang Di found that it was the crab in the pond that had helped him, he re
warded it with two more legs. Thereafter, only the crab in the local pond has ten
legs.
As the prominent hero and common ancestor of Han Chinese people,
Huang Di receives great respect in Chinese history. During the Late Imperial
era, he was respected as one of the common ancient ancestors of everyone in the
Chinese nation (Zhonghua Minzu) in the process of constructing a modern na
tion. He no longer belonged only to the Han. All of the non-Han ethnic groups,
whether Mongolian or Qiang, were also the offspring of Huang Di. Now the col
lective memory of “the descendants of Huang Di and Yan Di” is widely held by
Chinese all over the world. Huang Di has become a cultural symbol that is often
used to reinforce the unified identity of Chinese people and to solidify group at
tachments among the fifty-six ethnic groups in China.
On April 5, the Tomb-sweeping Day of 2003, a large sacrificial ritual offer
ing to Huang Di was held at the Xuanyuan Temple in Huangling County,
Shaanxi Province. Among the people who attended the ceremony were many

important officials of the Communist Party and representatives of overseas Chi
nese from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao (Aomen), Canada, Australia, and South
east Asia. They came together to worship “the Common Ancestor of the Chi
nese People” and “the Founder of Human Civilization.”

HUNDUN
Hundun is an obscure mythical figure in Chinese mythology. The word hundun
is used in Chinese language as both a noun and an adjective that literally refers
to the primeval chaos as well as a person who is ignorant or muddleheaded.
Mythical stories about Hundun may personify these two aspects of his name.
Ancient recordings about Hundun are often quite different from or even
contradictory to each other, which perhaps suggests that they come from differ
ent narrative traditions. Therefore, it is almost impossible to find a consistent
character and function of Hundun.
Perhaps the most often cited Hundun myth appears in Zhuangzi. It portrays
Hundun as the god of the central region who has not a single aperture. Shu (lit
erally meaning “fast”) was the god of the south sea while Hu (“swift”) was the
god of the north sea. They often met each other at the central region reigned by
Hundun. Hundun treated them very well, so Shu and Hu hoped to pay a debt of
gratitude to him. They presumed that everyone had seven apertures in his head
(two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and one mouth) with which to see, hear, eat,
and breathe, but Hundun had none; therefore, if they could make seven aper
tures in Hundun’s head, they could repay him for his kindness. They tried to
chisel openings in Hundun’s body. They chiseled one hole each day. However,
after seven days of their work, Hundun died.
Like many other myths or legends appearing in this classic, the Hundun
story has clearly been reshaped by Zhuang Zhou to illustrate his Taoist philoso
phy. The two meddling gods Shu and Hu are used to symbolize the artificial
order (time and direction), whereas Hundun symbolizes the primeval chaos that
is a natural, unspecified, unified whole. In the story the artificial order destroyed
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
146



the natural and harmonic whole. Zhuang thus expresses his idea that one should
respect nature and not insist on doing something that is not natural; politicians
should let things take their own course and should not construct uninformed in
terventionist policies.
However, contrary to his depiction as a kind and innocent god of the central
region in Zhuangzi, Hundun is at times described as a bad and ferocious deity in
other writings. In an account from Zuozhuan, Hundun was said to be Dihong
shi’s unintelligent son (according to some commentators, Dihongshi is in fact
Huang Di, the ruler of the central part of the world), one of the “Four Evil Ones”
(Si Xiong), who was later exiled by the sage king Shun. He concealed justice and
did not take righteous actions. He liked to treat people cruelly and do harm to
them secretly. He made close friends with those evil beings who acted and spoke
against justice and virtue. Because he was so muddled and incompetent, he was
called Hundun.
Some scholars believe that a minor deity, Dijiang, who appeared in Shanhai
jing is in fact Hundun (Yuan 1993, 66; Birrell 1993, 98–100). According to a text
from Shanhaijing, Dijiang lived in a western mountain called Tianshan (“Sky
Mountain”). His shape was like a yellow bag, and his color was as red as the
cinnabar flame. He had six feet and four wings but no head and face. He knew
how to sing and dance. Though Dijiang and Hundun have similar appearances of
featureless heads, it remains difficult to conclude that Dijiang can be identified
as Hundun himself, because they share few functions and behaviors.
Another account relating to Hundun appears in a later book, Shenyijing (The
Classic of Spirits and Strange Things, once said to have been written by a Han
writer, Dongfang Shuo, 154–93 BC, but probably compiled later by an anonymous
author). It clearly combines the two contradictory narrative traditions about
Hundun in Zuozhuan and Shanhaijing. It states that there was an animal on the
west side of Kunlun Mountain. It looked like a dog with long hair and four feet,
or like a brown bear without claws. It had two eyes but could not see. It had two
ears but could not hear. It had a stomach yet was without the five internal or
gans. It had intestines, but they were so straight that food would go immediately
through his body. When the creature found someone of virtue, it would run and
butt him; but when it found someone of evil, it would lean on him. When doing
nothing, it often bit its own tail, turning around and around, looking up at the
sky and laughing. It is also called Hundun.

JIANDI
Jiandi is the ancestress of the Shang people and the second wife of Di Ku. She in
gested a swallow’s egg and miraculously gave birth to Qi, the founder of the
Shang people.
Most gods or goddesses and heroes or heroines in Chinese mythology have
miraculous birth stories. Huang Di, for example, was conceived after his mother
saw a great bolt of lightning circling one of the stars in the Great Bear, Houji was
conceived after his mother stepped into a huge footprint, Yu was born from the
belly of his father’s corpse, and there are numerous other stories of miraculous
births. The mythical births show the deities’ sacred origins, testify to their un
usual abilities, and promise their significant achievements.
Myths about Jiandi’s miraculous conception and the birth of Qi can be
found in some ancient classics. Poems in Shijing (Eulogy of Shang, for example)
mention that the founder of the Shang people comes from a swallow. The fa
mous Zhou poet Qu Yuan clearly names Jiandi in his well-known poem “Tian
wen.” He asks, “Jiandi stayed on the terrace, why did Di Ku go there and seduce
her? The swallow sent two eggs to her, why did she devour them?” Wang Yi, the
Han commentator of this poem, explains these questions with the story that
when Jiandi was serving Di Ku on the terrace, a swallow passing by dropped its
egg. Jiandi was pleased and devoured it. Then she gave birth to Qi.
In another version that appears in Shiji, Jiandi is said to be a daughter of
the Yousong clan and the second concubine of Di Ku. One day when she went
out to take a bath with Di Ku, she saw a swallow dropping an egg. She picked it
up and swallowed it. Then she inexplicably became pregnant, and later gave
birth to Qi.
In addition to Jiandi’s main mythological function as the ancestress of the
Shang people, a text in Lüshi Chunqiu illustrates another role Jiandi played as a
culture heroine: In the Yousong clan there were two beautiful girls (according to
some accounts, one was Jiandi and the other was named Jianci). They lived in a
terrace nine stories high. Each meal they ate had to be accompanied by drum

148



music. One day the Supreme Divinity (Di) sent a swallow to visit them. The
swallow sweetly sang, repeating “Yiyi.” The two girls loved it so much that they
tried to catch the swallow. Finally they covered it with a jade basket. When they
lifted up the basket after a while, the swallow flew away immediately toward
the north, leaving two eggs behind. The girls were so disappointed that they
composed a song, singing “Swallow, swallow, you flew away,” which is credited
with being the origin of northern music. This story does not mention Jiandi’s ex
traordinary conception. But Gao You, the Han commentator of Lüshi Chunqiu,
wrote that the Supreme Divinity was in fact the God of Heaven; it was he who
ordered the swallow to lay two eggs for the girls of the Yousong clan to swallow
so that one would give birth to Qi.
A Han dynasty book, Lienüzhuan (Biographies of Exemplary Women, writ
ten by Liu Xiang, 79–8 BC), rationalized and demythologized the Jiandi myth and
set Jiandi as an exemplary mother of female virtues who could educate women
to obey Confucian ethical rules. The story of Jiandi is set in the time of the sage
king Yao. She was the elder sister of the Yousong clan. One day Jiandi and her
sisters went out to take a bath in a river of Xuanqiu when they saw a swallow
passing by and dropping a colorful egg. They all competed with each other to
catch it, and Jiandi won. Protecting it from being seized by her sisters, she put
the egg into her mouth, but swallowed it by accident. Then she became preg
nant and later gave birth to Qi. Jiandi was good at managing the ways of the
world, and she was quite knowledgeable and benevolent. When Qi grew up, she
taught him the rules of truth and order, and eventually helped him to succeed.
Thus she was respected by honorable men as a model mother who had the
virtues of benevolence, reason, and subservience.
Jiandi has some correlation with the ancient custom of worshiping Gaomei,
the Supreme Matchmaker. Gaomei was originally and probably a divine stone
that was believed to have the magic power of bestowing children to people.
Later it became anthropomorphized in some places as a great mother or ances
tress like Nüwa, Jiandi, or Jiang Yuan, and its main function became matching
people and bestowing children. According to recordings from Shijing and Liji
(Record of Ritual, the early Han accounts), as well as some of their Han com
mentators’ annotations, Jiandi reinforced the custom of worshiping Gaomei.
They said that every spring when swallows flew back from the south, people
would go to the countryside to offer sacrifices to Gaomei and pray for children.
The emperor would also lead all of his consorts there, and they usually offered a
pig, a sheep, and a bull as the sacrifices. By displaying bows and arrows in front
of the statue of Gaomei, they hoped that they could bear intelligent sons. Once
when Jiandi went to worship Gaomei with her husband, Di Ku, she caught a
falling swallow egg and ate it. Afterwards she became pregnant and gave birth to

the founder Qi. Her mythical experience was interpreted as the effectiveness of
Gaomei’s sacred power, so the emperors later built a temple to worship Gaomei.
However, according to a text cited by Taiping Yulan (An Imperial Reading
of Texts Compiled in the Taiping Era [977–984 CE], compiled by Li Fang, 925–996
CE, chapter 529), the Gaomei custom originated from the Jiandi story. It states
that in 296 CE, the divine Gaomei stone that rested on the sacrificial altar was
broken into two pieces. The emperor and many officials wondered why a stone
was put on the altar and whether they should salvage it. Then a knowledgeable
consultant explained that at the time of Di Ku, Jiandi swallowed an egg and then
gave birth to a great son. Thereafter, ordinary people put an egg-shaped stone on
the altar to pray for children. The old broken stone thus was buried, and a new
one was installed.
There are some Chinese scholars who argue that the role of Gaomei was ac
tually assumed by the ancestress Jiandi in ancient times. For example, Jiandi
was in fact the Gaomei worshiped by the Shang people, and Nüwa and Jiang
Yuan were the Gaomei worshiped by the Xia and Zhou people (Wen 1982). Thus,
rather than believing in a Gaomei stone, people searched for Gaomei magic
power from these special goddesses.

JIANG YUAN
Ancestress of the Zhou people, the first consort of Di Ku, and the mother of
Houji, Jiang Yuan stepped into a huge footprint in a field and miraculously gave
birth to Houji, the God of Agriculture and the founder of the Zhou people.
The Jiang Yuan myth appears very early in the first Chinese poetry collection,
Shijing. The poem “Shengmin” (“Giving Birth to Our People”) highly praised her
and her son Houji. It describes in detail her miraculous conception and bearing of
Houji:
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
150



The first birth of [our] people,
Was from Jiang Yuan.
How did she give birth to a person?
She had offered a sacrifice to the Supreme Divinity,
To ward off the misfortune of childlessness.
By chance she stepped into a huge toe-print made by the Supreme Divinity,
and her body was stirred.
She then began to live in a separate room undisturbed.
Jiang Yuan became pregnant, and she behaved even more devoutly and
solemnly.
She gave birth to [a son],
Who was Houji.
When her pregnancy had come to full-term,
Her first-born son was delivered as easy as the birth of a lamb.
His afterbirth didn’t burst,
And there was no injury to him.
It was a result of the Supreme Divinity showing his mythical power.
The Supreme Divinity was satisfied and calm,
Accepting and enjoying her offering and sacrifice,
And she easily brought forth her son.
[Scared by his abnormal conception,] Jiang Yuan abandoned her son on a nar
row lane,
But the sheep and oxen protected him and fed him.
Jiang Yuan then tried to place him in a forest,
But gave up for there happened to be many wood-cutters there.
She then threw him away on the cold ice,
And a bird sheltered and supported him with its wings.
When the bird flew away,
Houji began to wail.
His cry was so long and loud,
That his voice filled all his surroundings.
...
Another version of the Jiang Yuan myth is given in the exemplary historical
book Shiji (“The Basic Annals of Zhou” chapter), in which Jiang Yuan is said to be
the daughter of the Youtai clan and the first consort of Di Ku. One day when she
went into a field, she saw a huge footprint. She was very curious and pleased and
so she trod in it. As soon as she did this, there was a movement in her body as if
she had become pregnant. She bore a son in due time. However, since Jiang Yuan
was miraculously pregnant, she considered the baby to be something inauspi
cious, so she abandoned it in a narrow alley. When the oxen and sheep passed the
alley, they all detoured to avoid stepping on the baby. Jiang Yuan attempted to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 151



throw it into a forest, but she happened to meet many people in the forest. Jiang
Yuan threw it away again on the ice, but the birds covered and warmed it with
their wings. Jiang Yuan thought Houji must be a god, so she brought the child
home and raised it. Because she wanted to abandon it in the beginning, she named
it Qi (“the Abandoned”), who later became the founder of the Zhou people and the
god of agriculture.
Though Jiang Yuan was the receiver of a miraculous conception and wanted
to abandon her baby in the beginning, she is portrayed as an ideal woman and an
exemplary mother in some historicized writings. A story recorded in Lienüzhuan,
for instance, presents Jiang Yuan as a model mother who has the female virtues
praised by Confucians, such as chastity and constancy. Being set in the time of the
emperor Yao, in the story she is said to be the daughter of the Marquis Tai. When
she stepped in the huge footprint and became pregnant, she felt very strange and
disgusted about the coming baby. She divined and offered sacrifices to the gods in
order to abort the fetus. However, her son was born anyway. No matter where she
threw him, he received protection and survived. She realized the baby must be
something unusual, so she brought it back home. She was a pure and quiet
woman with concentrated attention, and she was good at cultivating. So when
Houji grew up, she taught him to sow and cultivate. Because of the education she
gave him, Houji became a famed minister of agriculture in administration of Yao
and Shun. Therefore she was respected by men of honor as a virtuous mother who
was pure, chaste, and successful in civilizing her son.
Jiang Yuan is also worshiped in folk belief as a goddess. An article written
by a scholar named Cui Yingke in the 1920s introduced the rituals and legends
about Jiang Yuan in his hometown in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province. There
was a Jiang Yuan mausoleum in this area, popularly called “Goddess Jiang’s
Temple.” On every lunar March 1, a temple fair would be held there to offer sac
rifices to Jiang Yuan. Local operas would be performed for her for three days.
During the fair, people often polished coins on the stone tablet in front of the
mausoleum, by which they believed that the coins would become powerful and
thus could keep their holders (especially children) healthy and safe. Stories
orally transmitted in that area clearly show that the Jiang Yuan myth may have
become localized and demythologized in later times. In the stories, Jiang Yuan is
usually portrayed as a miserable farm girl who suffered a lot from her miracu
lous conception and finally became respected because of her notable son. One
legend says that when Goddess Jiang was still a young girl, one snowy day in
winter she went to the threshing ground to fetch some firewood. The snow was
so heavy that she could hardly walk. Then she found two lines of huge foot
prints along the road where she should go, and she stepped in them. Because the
footprints were made by a god, she got pregnant by stepping in them. When she
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
152



was ready to give birth and was going to be brought to bed in her home, her
mother made her ride a mule and go to the field to give birth since she felt
shamed by her daughter’s pregnancy. When the baby was ready to appear, the
mule also happened to be ready to give birth. Worried that this might disturb her
own childbirth, Goddess Jiang used a gold needle to block the mule’s birth canal.
From then on the mule could no longer bear offspring. When the baby came out,
she threw it into a pool. It was in June, but the pool water suddenly iced up.
While the baby lay on the ice, birds flew over to cover and warm him. Since that
time, the pool would ice up every June; the village where the pool was located
was named “Ice-pool Village.” Meanwhile, Jiang’s sister-in-law sent a pot of
dough drop soup to the field, but the pot was broken halfway there, and the soup
flowed down a local hillside, so it later was called “the Hillside of Dough Drop
Soup.” Believing that Jiang’s miraculous conception would bring misfortune to
the village, some of her neighbors chased after her and tried to beat her. Goddess
Jiang ran away. When they had almost caught her, there suddenly came a gale
that blew for three days. When the gale stopped, the people found that Goddess
Jiang had disappeared and that a mausoleum appeared in her place. They called
the building “Jiang Yuan’s Mausoleum.”
Another legend states that Goddess Jiang’s son loved to cultivate every
where and was respected as “Ji the Highness.” He often asked his mother about
his father, to which Goddess Jiang replied, “You have no father.” He felt very
upset. When the local operas were sung for the goddess in her temple during the
fair, the statue of Ji the Highness would always be carried down the Mountain of
King Ji to visit his mother. When they met each other, the statue of the son
would always be arranged to turn his back to his mother, which was said to be
because he still felt upset about being born without a father.

JINGWEI
Jingwei is a mythical bird that metamorphosed from Yan Di’s daughter and in
domitably tried to fill up the sea with pebbles.
Yan Di, the Flame Emperor, had a young daughter named Nü Wa (different
from the great mother and cosmic repairer Nüwa; nü means “female,” wa
means “child”). Nü Wa was playing in the eastern sea but was fatally drowned
and never returned. She turned into a bird called Jingwei. Jingwei lived on Fajiu
Mountain, located in the north. It looked like a crow but had a colorful head,
white beak, and red claws. Its name is derived from the sound of its call, which
sounds like “jingwei.” It always carried a pebble or a twig in its mouth and
dropped it into the eastern sea, where Nü Wa lost her young life. Jingwei tried
unyieldingly to fill up the vast sea with its tiny efforts, never stopping.
In one version Jingwei was said to have mated with a sea swallow. Their fe
male children looked much like Jingwei, and the male children looked much

like the sea swallow. Because Jingwei was drowned in the eastern sea in its pre
existence, it swore not to drink the water of the eastern sea. Thus it was also
called Oath Bird. And since it had not yet received revenge for its grudge and re
sentment, Jingwei was also called Grudge Bird. Jingwei persistently tried to fill
up the sea in spite of the great difficulty and impossibility, so it was also called
Resolve Bird. Since Jingwei was formerly the emperor’s daughter, it was some
times called Emperor’s Daughter Bird.
The myth of Jingwei is well-known to most Han Chinese people. Many feel
sympathetic to Jingwei’s misfortune and admire the bird for its bravery, tough
ness, and unyieldingness. This myth continues to appear in many poems, nov
els, and dramas, combining the diverse themes of pathos, courage, and the re
fusal to accept defeat. “Jingwei Tries to Fill the Sea” has become an idiom that
encourages people to learn from Jingwei’s spirit and to work bravely and persis
tently, no matter how hard the task seems.

KUAFU
Kuafu is the grandson of Houtu and the mythical hero who chased the sun to
compete with it in a race but died of thirst in the end. His stick then trans
formed into a forest of peach trees.
“Chasing the sun” is a striking motif in Chinese mythology, especially in
Han Chinese myths. Besides the Kuafu myth, there is another type of myth con
taining this motif. Being well-known by the common name of “Erlang Carried
Mountains and Chased the Sun,” the myth usually tells how a hero named Er
lang (literally meaning “the second son”) carried mountains on a shoulder pole
and chased the superfluous suns; eventually he caught them and pressed them
down under the mountains. The story is often used to explain the character of
the sun’s circulation (why it rises every morning and rests during the night, for
instance) and the origins of some local mountains or hot springs.
Comparatively, the myth “Kuafu Chased the Sun” is much more popular,
and it boasts a rather long recorded history. The earliest and most comprehen
sive recordings of his myth can be found in Shanhaijing, a major repository of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 155



ancient Chinese mythic narratives. A text from that book (chapter 17) states
that there was a mountain called Chengdu Zaitian in the great wilderness. A god
named Kuafu lived in it. There were two yellow snakes circling his ears and an
other two yellow snakes in his hands. He was the grandson of Houtu. Kuafu
overvalued his own strength, so he wanted to chase the sun’s shadow and catch
the sun at Yugu (Yu Valley). He felt very thirsty halfway there, so he decided to
drink from the river. Since the river water was not enough for him, he then de
cided to go to the great marsh. But he died of thirst on his way. Another text
from the same book (chapter 8) states that Kuafu competed with the sun in a
race. He entered into the aureole of the sun. Being very thirsty, he went to drink
in the Yellow River and the Wei River, but they were not enough for him. Then
he decided to go northward to the great marsh. He died of thirst before he arrived
there. His walking stick transformed into a forest of peach trees. Another ver
sion appearing in Liezi adds that after Kuafu died of thirst in his race with the
sun, he abandoned his walking stick. Nourished by the fat from his corpse, the
stick turned into a peach tree forest, which extended for thousands of miles.
Some other myth versions portray Kuafu as a divine animal who looked like
a big monkey with spotted arms and a panther’s tail. He was good at casting and
often threw stones at people. Others say that Kuafu died of execution instead of
thirst. He was killed by Yinglong, the executioner who also killed Chiyou.
Scholars have interpreted that the reason for his execution was that both Chiyou
and Kuafu were the descendants of Yan Di (Kuafu’s grandfather, Houtu, was said
to be the descendant of Yan Di too), so they both fought against Huang Di to
seek revenge for the defeated Yan Di. They failed in the battle and were executed
by Huang Di’s subordinate, Yinglong (Yuan 1996, 144–150).
Among these many myth versions, “Kuafu Chased the Sun” is the most in
fluential one. It sometimes even serves as an etiological myth to explain many
local landforms. According to some ancient documents, for instance, there were
three mountains in the east of Chenzhou Prefecture (now part of Hunan
Province), standing like three legs of a tripod caldron thousands of feet high.
They were said to be the legs of the caldron used by Kuafu when he competed
with the sun in a race and cooked there along the way. In Anding County (now
in Gansu Province), there was a knoll named “Mound of Shaking Shoes,” which
was said to be formed by the sand and earth shaken out of Kuafu’s shoes. When
Kuafu was chasing the sun, he took off his shoes and shook them there to pour
out the sand and earth bothering him. In Taizhou Prefecture (now part of Zhe
jiang Province), there was a huge footprint on Mount Fufu, which was said to be
made by Kuafu while he was chasing the sun.
A modern fieldwork report from Lingbao County in Henan Province shows
that the myth of “Kuafu Chased the Sun” is still told in contemporary China,
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
156



and Kuafu is worshiped as a supreme god in the local pantheon (Zhang Zhenli
and Cheng 1987, 270–283). Several traces of the Kuafu myth were found in Ling
bao County, such as “Mount Kuafu,” “Kuafu Valley,” and “Kuafu Barrack” (it is
said that there were barracks there in ancient times). A Qing stone tablet (1837
CE) in Kuafu Valley was found during the fieldwork, and the epigraph inscribed
on it explained why the mountain was named Mount Kuafu: Kuafu was a man
who lived at the shore of the east sea. He was good at walking and running very
fast. He was familiar with the sunrise, but wondered how it set, so he took a
stick and chased the sun. When he ran to this mountain, he was so thirsty that
he died there. Therefore, the mountain was called “Mount Kuafu.”
A modern Kuafu myth collected in the village of Kuafu Barrack states that
Kuafu died of anger rather than thirst. Kuafu wondered how the sun set, so he
decided to chase the sun to have a look. When he ran to this mount, he felt very
thirsty. He drank some water and took a nap. When he awoke, he saw that the
sun was just about to set. Realizing that he could not catch up with the sun, he
was extremely angry and at last died of anger. Because he was buried there, the
valley got the name “Kuafu Valley,” and the mountain was called “Mount
Kuafu.” Other versions say that after Kuafu died, his stick turned into a forest of
peach trees. To commemorate him, later generations planted more peach trees
there. A rule was established that these peach trees must not be chopped down.
For Kuafu’s sake, the peach trees in that area flourished, and the forest extended
for hundreds of miles.
Kuafu was worshiped as the god of Mount Kuafu. Until the 1960s, in every
lunar October (some versions say February), villagers in Kuafu Valley would
offer sacrifices and perform local operas for him. The fair usually lasted for three
to five days. The villagers were proud that they were the descendants of Kuafu,
and they believed he would protect them.
“Kuafu Chased the Sun” has long been used as an idiom. Though it may oc
casionally be used to criticize those people who overrate their own ability and act
blindly against reality, it is often used as a positive metaphor for man’s courage,
toughness, persistence, and unyieldingness. Tao Yuanming (365–427 CE), a
renowned Jin poet, highly praised Kuafu in one of his poems:
Kuafu cherished a great ambition,
He then competed with the sun in a race.
At the same time they reached Yü Valley, where the sun set down,
It seemed neither of them won.
Because Kuafu possessed such divine power,
How could the water in the rivers be enough for him to drink, even if they
were drunk up?
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 157



His remains metamorphosed into the forest of peach trees,
And his merit was achieved after his death.
The Kuafu myth appears in many other Chinese poems, novels, operas, and
cartoon films. Kuafu is usually depicted as a tragic but great hero who bravely
challenges the difficult and impossible, and he intrepidly acts in order to realize
his dream and ambition.

KUI
Kui is the one-legged mythical monster killed by Huang Di. Its hide was used to
make a drum for defeating Chiyou.
Descriptions about Kui in ancient writings vary greatly. Among them, the
most well-known Kui myth appears in Shanhaijing. In that book (chapter 14), Kui
was said to be a divine beast who lived on Mount Liubo (liubo literally means
“flowing wave”) in the east sea. It looked like an ox but was gray, hornless, and
one-legged. Whenever it came out or dived into the sea, a storm would follow. Its
light was like the sunlight and moonlight, and its sound was like the thunder.
Later it was caught by Huang Di, who made a drum by using its hide as the cover.
When struck with the bone of the Thunder God, the drum made a great sound
that could be heard over five hundred miles away. Huang Di used the drum to
show his power to the whole world. In some versions, this drum made by Kui’s
skin played an important role in the battle between Huang Di and Chiyou.
Chiyou was the offspring of Yan Di. He was the god of war and the inventor
of military weapons. He had eighty brothers (seventy-one brothers in another
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
158



version), each of them with an animal body, bronze head, and iron forehead, who
spoke human language. Chiyou was said to be able to soar into the sky and sur
mount the dangerous and difficult obstructions. When he rebelled against
Huang Di, Huang Di had a difficult time defeating him. But eventually Huang
Di caught Kui and made a drum from its hide. He thus beat it many times dur
ing war. The sound it made was so great that it prevented Chiyou from flying
away and escaping him during their great battle. So Chiyou was caught in the
end and was beheaded by Huang Di.
Other versions depict Kui as a one-legged horned dragon. Its scales shone
like the sun and moon. If it happened to be seen, it would bring a drought to the
place where it was seen. Sometimes Kui was said to look like a monkey with a
man’s face, and had the ability to talk. Kui was also described as a drum-shaped
animal with one leg. It was the spirit of the mountain. If one called its name,
then it could help one to catch the tiger and panther.
In written texts in which scholars have rationalized to explain history, Kui
is said to be a humanized master of music under the administrations of the sage
kings Yao and Shun. According to a text from Shangshu (Ancient History, which
may also be called Shujing, The Classic of History, traditionally said to have
been compiled by Confucius, 551–479 BC, but later mixed with some other
texts), Shun appointed Kui to be his official of music and to educate his descen
dants. Kui answered that if he beat and stroked a stone, all animals would follow
his melody and dance. Another recording from Lüshi Chunqiu (Annals of Mas
ter Lü, third century BC) clearly illustrated Kui’s role as a culture hero who in
vented music. Being the master of music of Yao, Kui (originally written as
“Zhi,” but many commentators thought he was in fact Kui) invented song by
imitating the sound he heard in the mountain forest and gully. He made a drum
by stretching a beast’s hide over an earthen jar. He beat and stroked stone, trying
to imitate the sound made by the Supreme Divinity’s jade chime stone. The
melody he invented was so pleasant and tuneful that all the animals began to
dance along with it.
Another popular story related with Kui is that its one-legged character was
cunningly interpreted by Confucius as a lesson in life that “one is enough.”
Confucius used the term zu as a pun to create a fabled lesson from the Kui
myth. In the Chinese language, zu can be used as both a noun meaning “foot”
and an adjective meaning “enough.” So, yi zu can mean either “one leg” or “one
is enough” (in which yi means “one”). When Confucius was asked whether Kui
was really one-legged (yi zu), he replied that Kui was indeed yi zu: one is enough.
Confucius described Kui as an accomplished and talented official who con
tributed much to society. He explained that Kui was the master of music for the
sage king Shun, and he adjusted the tune and harmonized the music. Since
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 159



music was highly revered during this time as contributing to the education and
governance of society, Kui’s work helped to bring order to the world, and people
became convinced that Kui was indeed a model official. Therefore, Confucius
explained, if an emperor had an excellent official like Kui, one was enough. In
this way, Confucius skillfully dissolved this myth and rationalized the Kui
story. He turned Kui, the one-legged mythical monster, into a virtuous and tal
ented historical official.

KUNLUN MOUNTAIN
One of the most remarkable mythical mountains in Chinese mythology, Kunlun
Mountain is the earthly residence of the Supreme Divinity, a paradise of deities
and immortals, one of the pillars of the sky that prevents heaven from collaps
ing, and a sky ladder that links the earth to heaven.
Descriptions about the mystery, grandeur, or magnificence of Kunlun
Mountain in ancient writings are indeed abundant. The renowned Zhou dynasty
poet Qu Yuan sketchily depicted it in his inquisitive poem “Tianwen.” Among
those various descriptions, one of the earliest and most comprehensive depic
tions comes from Shanhaijing. In a text from that volume (chapter 11), Kunlun
was said to be a huge mountain located in the northwest. It was the earthly resi
dence of the Supreme Divinity and the dwelling of other gods. It was 800 li (400
kilometers, or 248 miles) square and 80,000 feet high. On the summit were nine
wells, nine gates, and magic grain. The balustrades of the wells were made of
jade. The gates were all guarded by the divine beast Kaiming (“Enlightened”),
which looked like a big tiger with nine heads and human faces. The magic grain,
named Muhe (literally meaning “Tree Grain”), was forty feet tall and five spans
wide. To the west of Kunlun Mountain were phoenixes that wore snakes on
their bodies and stepped on snakes. To the north of the mountain were the Pearl
Tree, the Jade Tree, the Tree of Immortality, Tree Grain, the Sweet Spring, and
Shirou (meaning “Seeing Flesh”). Shirou was a substance shaped like a cow’s
liver with two eyes. It could never be completely consumed. Every time it was
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
160



eaten, it would regenerate. To the east of Kunlun Mountain were six shamans
who surrounded Yayu’s corpse and rescued him with the elixir of immortality.
Yayu was a deity with a human face and snake body who was killed by the
deities Erfu and Wei; the six shamans were ordered to revive him. To the south
of the mountain were a six-headed bird, a hornless dragon, snakes, panthers, and
others. Kunlun was a place where the deities dwelled. It was so rocky and steep
that only the benevolent and talented hero Yi could ascend the mountain.
Another text from Shanhaijing (chapter 2) also sets Kunlun Mountain in the
west as the earthly capital city of the Supreme Divinity, which is rich in odd an
imals and plants. It was ruled by the deity Luwu, who had a man’s face, tiger’s
body and paws, and nine tails. He was also the ruler of the nine parts of heaven
and the seasons of the Supreme Divinity’s garden.
A magic beast named Tulou lived on Kunlun Mountain. It looked like a
sheep with four horns, and it ate human beings. There was a bird named
Qinyuan, shaped like a bee but as big as a mandarin duck. If it stung other birds
and beasts, they would die; and if it stung trees, the trees would wither. Another
magic bird, Chunniao, resembled a phoenix and took charge of the Supreme Di
vinity’s clothes and utensils. The Shatang Tree was waterproof; one who con
sumed its wood would float in water instead of sinking. Also found on the moun
tain, the Pincao Grass could make one who consumed it forget his troubles and
always be happy. Kunlun Mountain was said to be the source of four rivers: the
Yellow River, Red River (Chishui), Yang River, and Black River (Heishui).
In various pictures drawn in Yubenji (written in the Warring States era, cited
by Shiji), Huainanzi, Shiyiji, and other writings, Kunlun appears as a pillar of the
sky (in one version a pillar of the earth) located at the center of the world. This
was the paradise of the deities and immortals, the place where the sun and the
moon hid in turn while the other one glared out of the blue sky, and a huge di
vine mountain that contained numerous marvelous and wonderful items.
Among them were the Sweet Spring and Emerald Lake (Yaochi); colorful clouds
and waters; Tree Grain; the Pearl Tree, the Jade Tree, and the Tree of Immortal
ity; Cinnabar River (Dan Shui), whose water prevented its drinker from death;
and Weak River (Ruoshui), whose water was so weak that it could not even float
a feather. Some versions state that Kunlun Mountain was composed of three
tiers. The lowest one was called Fantong, the middle one was Xuanpu (literally
meaning “the Suspending Garden”), and the highest one was Zengcheng (literally
meaning “the Increased City”), which was also named the “Palace of Heaven”
and was the residence of the Supreme Divinity (Tai Di). Others say that even
Zengcheng was nine stories tall. According to a text from Huainanzi (chapter 4),
however, the first tier of Kunlun Mountain was Liangfeng (Cool Wind Mountain).
Anyone who climbed it would receive immortality. The second tier was called
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 161



Xuanpu. Persons who climbed this tier would acquire spiritual power and could
control the wind and rain. And if one climbed further, one would arrive at
heaven, the residence of the Supreme Divinity, and thereafter one would become
a spirit. Here Kunlun Mountain functioned not only as a pillar of the sky but also
as a sky ladder that connected the earth with heaven. In some later traditions,
Kunlun was rebuilt into a Taoist paradise for immortals. An account appearing in
Shiyiji depicts Kunlun as a mountain that was even higher than the sun and
moon. It had nine tiers that were separated from each other by 5,000 kilometers
(3,100 miles). The clouds surrounded them and the wind blew from the four di
rections. Immortals often went there to play by riding on dragons and cranes.
Though Kunlun is quite famous, it became much better known because of
its association with an important goddess in Chinese mythology, Xiwangmu, or
the Queen Mother of the West. Some sources suggest that Kunlun Mountain is
also the residence of the goddess (other versions say that she presides over the
Jade Mountain, which is very close to Kunlun). A text from Shanhaijing (chapter
16) states that Kunlun Mountain was located south of the west sea, on the shore
of the Liusha (meaning “Flowing Sand”), behind the Red River, and in front of
the Black River. A spirit dwelled in the mountain. It was human-headed with a
tiger’s body and white spotted tail. The Weak River circled the bottom of the
mountain, and a flaming mountain surrounded it. A deity named Xiwangmu in
habited a cave there. She (or he; the text makes this unclear) wore a Sheng crown
and had tiger’s teeth and a panther’s tail. Other versions say that Kunlun Moun
tain was surrounded by the Weak River and that only deities and immortals
could arrive there by riding on dragons. Three green divine birds flew in and out,
fetching food for Xiwangmu. Xiwangmu is popularly known as the keeper of the
elixir of immortality and the magic peaches; both of them have the power to
keep one’s vitality and prevent death. In the Yi myth, the hero Yi is said to have
received the elixir of immortality from Xiwangmu. Since the text in Shanhai
jing (chapter 11, mentioned above) says that only the benevolent and talented
hero Yi could ascend the mountain, it might be deduced that Yi scrambled up
Kunlun Mountain and asked Xiwangmu for the precious elixir. But, unfortu
nately, the elixir of immortality was eventually stolen by Yi’s wife Chang’e, and
Chang’e then flew to the moon and became the spirit of the moon.
Kunlun is a divine space where some important mythological events hap
pened. Besides the Yi and Xiwangmu myths, a Tang dynasty account from Du
yizhi (A Treatise on Strange Beings and Things, by Tang dynasty writer Li Rong,
ca. 846–874 CE) states that the great mother Nüwa married her brother on this
mountain and they became the first ancestors of the world. At the very begin
ning of the world, there were no other people except for Nüwa and her elder
brother. They lived on the mythical Kunlun Mountain. They wanted to become

162



husband and wife so that they might have children and populate the earth, but
felt shamed by this because of their blood relationship. They prayed to heaven
from the top of the mountain: “If Thou wouldst send us two forth as man and
wife, then make this smoke gather. If not, then make the smoke disperse.” The
smoke gathered immediately, so they married. However, Nüwa still felt very
shy and ashamed so she weaved grass into a fan to cover her face. That is why
brides often hold fans during their wedding ceremonies.
Kunlun still plays a significant role in later traditions, including legends,
tales, novels, and operas. In the popular legend of Lady White Snake, for instance,
Kunlun appeared as a paradise where the grass of immortality and numerous other
precious plants grow. It was presided over by an immortal named Nanji Xianweng
(meaning the “Immortal Grandfather of South Pole”). A white crane guarded
those treasured plants. The legend states that the special creature, the White
Snake, had magic power and transformed into a beautiful lady and married a man
named Xu Xian. A green snake changed into her maidservant. When Xu Xian was
horrified to death when he unexpectedly saw the original figure of his wife, Lady
White Snake flew to Kunlun Mountain and tried to steal the grass of immortality
to revive her husband. Her true love moved the Immortal Grandfather, so she was
granted her wish. Upon returning home, she boiled the grass and poured the juice
into her husband’s mouth. After a little while, Xu Xian awakened.
A distinguished Chinese historian, Gu Jiegang, argues that the classical Chi
nese myth system can be divided into two branches: one is the Kunlun myth
system, the other one is the Penglai myth system (Gu 1979). Based on Gu’s
analysis, another mythologist, Wang Xiaolian, maintains that there are two sys
tems of Chinese mythical paradises. One is the East Paradise, which is made up
of those immortals; alchemists; Penglai, the paradise floating on or under the
sea; and Guixu (“Returning Mountain”) located under the sea and containing
five divine mountains. The other is the West Paradise, which is made up of
deities; shamans; Kunlun, the earthly residence of the Supreme Divinity; and
the head stream of the Yellow River. The two traditions of the paradises are
transmitted separately, and they gradually became confused during the late War
ring States era (Wang 1987, 529–563).

LEIZU
The first wife of Huang Di, the grandmother of Zhuanxu. She started sericul
ture, the cultivation of silkworms and production of silk, and was worshiped as
the Sericulture Goddess after she died.
As the famed cradle of sericulture in the world, China boasts various myths
and legends about the origin of silkworms and silk production. One myth is
about Cancong, the founder of the ancient Shu kingdom (now in modern
Sichuan Province, southwestern China), and his contribution in teaching the
techniques of sericulture to humans in local mythology. Another well-known
legend about the silkworm’s origin is the “Horse-headed Lady” story, which ex
plains that the silkworm (its head looks like a horse’s head) is transformed from
a girl wrapped in a horsehide: A father went away with the army while his
daughter and horse stayed at home. After a period of time the daughter missed
her father very much. One day she joked with the horse that if it brought her fa
ther back home, she would marry it. The horse then ran away, located the army,
and brought her father back. Upon learning what had happened, the father was
shocked, and he killed the horse to prevent it from marrying his daughter. Its
hide was exposed to the sun in the yard. When the daughter played in the yard
one day, the horsehide suddenly flew over, wrapped her up, and flew away. The
father searched for his daughter in the horsehide for several days, and then found
she had changed into a silkworm on a mulberry tree. Later the daughter was
worshiped as the goddess of sericulture, and people offered sacrifices to her to
pray for a good silk harvest. Her figure was a young woman cloaking a horse
hide. She was popularly known as the Horse-headed Lady.
Among the variety of sericulture myths and legends, the Leizu myth is a
popular one. According to a text from Shiji (chapter 1), the exemplary historical
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
164



book written in the first century BC, Huang Di married a girl from the Xiling
clan. Her name was Leizu. As the first wife of Huang Di, she gave birth to two
sons, and one of them later fathered Zhuanxu, one of the Five August Emperors
in the mythical history of China. In many other ancient writings, Leizu was
commonly said to have started sericulture, so she was worshiped as Xiancan,
the ancestress of sericulture. One myth version holds that she died on an inspec
tion tour with Huang Di, so Huang Di honored her as the Road Goddess.
The Leizu story continues to be told in contemporary China. For example, a
myth collected in the 1980s in Xinzheng County, Henan Province (said to be
Huang Di’s home), portrays Leizu as a guilty maidservant of Xiwangmu, the
Queen Mother of the West. Without getting the goddess’s permission, she ate
some fruits of a mulberry tree that originally belonged to heaven. She thus was
able to vomit silk. In addition, she fed some colorful moths the mulberry leaves,
and they changed into the silkworms and were able to produce silk, too. Her ac
tions broke the rule of heaven, so she was punished and ousted from heaven to
the earth, where she became an ordinary farm girl. But she brought some silk
worms and mulberry tree seeds with her. After she met Huang Di and married
him, she taught people of his clan all the techniques of raising the silkworm,
reeling the silk, and weaving the silk. Because of her contribution, people
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 165
The Leizu temple at Xinzheng County, Henan Province, 2004. (Courtesy of Dai Gaizhen)



began to wear clothes. For this reason, she was worshiped as the ancestress of
sericulture.
Another myth collected in the same period in Dujiangyan City, Sichuan
Province, gives more details about Leizu’s inventions. This myth states that at
the time of Xuanyuan (another name of Huang Di), Leizu, who was Xuanyuan’s
wife, took charge of food and clothing in the clan. When Xuanyuan led men to
hunt wild animals outside, Leizu led women at home in peeling off the animals’
hides for clothes and boiling their flesh for food. The animal-skin clothes were
uncomfortable for wearing because they were hard, rough, and not ventilated.
One day Leizu went out with Xuanyuan to hunt wild pigs. She found herself
coming to a place where she had never been. There were lots of mulberry trees,
and the silkworms were eating the tree leaves. She found some cocoons there
and investigated them. The silk threads that came out of those cocoons were so
light, soft, and tough! Leizu was excited when she realized that she could make
cloth from the silk. She then picked many cocoons and took them back home.
She ordered women to reel the silk from the cocoons. Because the silk thread
from each cocoon was very long and there were many women reeling at the
same time, the silk threads were often tangled with each other. Leizu had no
idea of how to solve this problem.
Later, when she saw Xuanyuan turning a waterwheel, she had an idea. She
had a small wooden spinning wheel made with a handle fixed on it. When she
turned the handle and reeled the silk, the threads orderly rolled onto the wheel.
From then on, the silk threads were never tangled.
Then Leizu began to weave. At first, she tried to imitate the spider’s weav
ing but failed, because the silk was not as sticky as the spider’s thread. One day
when she went out to fish, she saw a big fish swimming back and forth freely be
tween the reeds. She then thought that she could weave by using a shuttle
shaped like a fish to weave back and forth between the silk threads. Her method
proved effective. She quickly wove a piece of fabric and formerly named it
“silk.” She then taught all the women of her clan the skill of weaving. Quickly
she faced another puzzle. Since many people now were in the mulberry field
gathering the cocoons, the cocoons became rare. To solve this problem, Leizu
brought some silkworms home and let them lay eggs there. She fed them mul
berry leaves that she picked up from the field and brought back. Because it was
so inconvenient to get more leaves, the silkworms soon died of hunger. Leizu
then asked Xuanyuan to dig up some of the wild mulberry trees and plant them
nearer to her home. A year later, mulberry trees were growing everywhere. Leizu
then began to show people how to plant the mulberry tree, how to raise the silk
worm, and how to reel and weave the silk. In the end, all the women in the
world learned these techniques.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology

Because of her great contribution to human life, Leizu won considerable re
spect. She is popularly worshiped by sericulturists as the Sericulture Goddess. In
Yuan’an County, Hubei Province, there is a Leizu temple (also named the Tem
ple of the Sericulture Goddess). Since Leizu is said to have been born on March
15 in this county, a temple fair is held on every lunar March 15. During the fair,
people play operas in front of the temple and pray for Leizu’s blessing and pro
tection of their silk productions. In Yanting County, Sichuan Province, there is a
Leizu mausoleum. Leizu is said to have been born there in Leizu Village. On
March 31, 2003, a large sacrificial ceremony was held in Mianyang City (to
which Yanting County belongs) to commemorate Leizu. Hosted by the local
government, the ceremony’s purpose was “commemorating Leizu, the Mother
of Huaxia [Han Chinese], and developing our Chinese virtues.” More than
10,000 people from Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces attended the ceremony.

LI
The Governor of Fire and the offspring of Zhuanxu, Li cut off the connection be
tween the sky and the earth with another deity, Zhong.
The motif of separating heaven from the earth is worldwide. In China, many
myths tell how at the very beginning, the sky and the earth were tightly linked
with each other or that there was only a narrow crack between them. Then, by
some means, they were separated from each other and remain apart through today.
Widely spread in ethnic groups such as the Han, Miao, Yao, Yi, Naxi, Buyi, Du
long, and Paiwan (in Taiwan), these myths are quite varied in the reasons for the
separation and the means by which this separation occurred. Some state that the
earth was separated from the heavens to punish human sins or to eradicate incon
veniences in human life (for instance, humans could not walk upright because
there was too little space, and they could not lift the pestle to pound rice freely).
Others state that the separation was caused by a deity’s action, such as lifting the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 167



sky up and pressing the earth down, setting up a pillar or pillars between them,
cutting off their contact with an axe, or using a broom to sweep the sky up high
and the earth down low. In some myths the separation was caused by animals. For
example, ants bite the sky tower and make it collapse, the ox and wolf cause the
separation, or a crab is to blame. One popular myth version asserts that the sky
was lifted up by a woman pounding rice using mortar and pestle. She disliked the
close connection between the sky and earth and the inconvenience caused by this
(it was hard for her to lift the pestle and pound the rice), so she poked the sky with
her pestle. The sky felt so much pain that it rose very high to where it is today. An
other well-known myth version holds that the separation was caused by a mistake
made by a dung beetle. At the very beginning of the world, the Supreme Divinity
in the sky asked a dung beetle to send a message to human beings on the earth that
they should have one meal every three days. But the dung beetle wrongly told peo
ple that they should have three meals a day. People ate much food from then on,
and thus they excreted more. The world was soon full of dirty excrement. The
Supreme Divinity was shocked when he smelled a foul odor emanating from the
earth. Therefore he decided to raise the sky far away from the earth. He punished
the dung beetle by making it clean up the excrement on the earth forever.
Among these various myths, a prominent one in ancient Chinese writings
is the myth that Zhong and Li broke off the connection between the sky and the
earth. The earliest record of this myth can be found in the most ancient Chinese
history book, Shangshu. A text from this book states that Chiyou started a re
volt and brought disaster to the common people. Influenced by him, people on
the earth gradually were corrupted. They began to cheat, steal, and rob. How
ever, the Miao people did not obey Chiyou, so he designated five brutal punish
ments to deal with them. Then, little by little, the Miao people also became cor
rupt. They began to cheat each other within their own group, mistreat people
from other groups, disobey their faith, and violate the oath between them and
the Supreme Divinity. Many innocent people brought complaints against them
to the Supreme Divinity. The Supreme Divinity thus ordered two of his subordi
nates, the deities Zhong and Li, to cut off the link between the sky and the
earth. From then on, the Miao people could never ascend to the sky again, but at
the same time, the deities could never descend to the earth.
The same story also appeared in another notable ancient historical book,
Guoyu, but here the story was much historicized and demythologized. A king of
the Chu state asked one of his officials, “According to Shangshu, Zhong and Li
broke off the way between the sky and the earth. Why? If not so, could people
then ascend to the sky?” The official rationally interpreted that this was not the
case. He interpreted that in remote antiquity, human beings did not intermingle
with the gods. There were five special officials to take charge of sacrificial affairs.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
168



They clearly directed people to offer sacrifices to gods, and directed the gods in
sending their blessings back to people. But at the end of Shaohao’s time, human
beings began to intermingle with the gods. People lost their awe for the gods, and
they offered sacrifices erratically. The gods did not consistently bestow their
blessings on humans, either. Famine and calamity occurred frequently. To solve
this problem, Zhuanxu ordered Zhong, the Governor of the South, to administer
heaven, which belonged to the gods; meanwhile Li, the Governor of Fire, was
charged to control the earth, which belonged to humans. Since then, the gods and
human beings do not intermingle with each other. And that was interpreted as the
real meaning of “cutting off the connection between the sky and the earth.”
Another Li myth version recorded in Shanhaijing (chapter 16) asserts that Li
was one of the grandsons of Zhuanxu. It says that in the great wilderness, there
was a “Sun and Moon Mountain,” which was the hinge of heaven. Its main peak
was Mount Wuju Tianmen (Tianmen means “the gate of heaven”), where the
sun and the moon set. There was a deity named Xu on it. He had a human face,
no arms, and two feet crossing his neck. Zhuanxu fathered Laotong, and Laotong
fathered Zhong and Li. The Supreme Divinity ordered Zhong to lift up the sky,
and told Li to press down the earth. After Li went down to the earth, he fathered
Ye (according to some analysts, Ye is in fact Xu), who stayed at the west pole of
the earth and directed the movements of the sun, the moon, and the stars.

LINGLUN
Linglun is the culture hero who invented music and many musical instruments.
In written texts that have been heavily historicized, he was said to be the Gover
nor of Music of Huang Di.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 169



There are numerous myths explaining how music and musical instruments
were invented in the remote past. Among them, Linglun and his inventions are
the most famous. In ancient writings such as Shiben (The Origin of Hereditary
Families, ca. third century BC), Lüshi Chunqiu (Annals of Master Lü, third cen
tury BC), and Fengsu Tongyi (Popular Customs and Traditions, second century
CE), Linglun was often said to be the Governor of Music under Huang Di, or
dered by Huang Di to establish music. So he went to the west of Daxia Marsh,
and to the north of Ruanyu Mountain, and located a kind of bamboo from the
Xiexi Valley. He made a pipe from it, and its sound made the base of ancient
Chinese musical modes. He then made twelve bamboo pipes and blew them by
imitating the phoenix’s singing. And that made up the twelve lü (a series of stan
dard bamboo pitch pipes used in ancient music). In this way, he invented the
five notes of the ancient Chinese five-tone scale (gong, shang, jiao, zhi, and yu,
equivalent to 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 in the numbered musical notation, or do, re, mi,
so, and la in the Western solfeggio), and the eight sounds made by eight musical
instruments—the xun (an egg-shaped, holed, clay wind instrument), sheng (a
pipe wind instrument made of gourd), drum, bamboo pipe, strings, qing (ancient
percussion instrument made from jade or stone), bell, and zhu (ancient percus
sion instrument made from wood).
Because of his great contribution to music, Linglun is respected in later tra
dition as the God of Music and the divine ancestor of actors. To this day, musi
cians and actors are generally called Linglun or Lingren (ren means “human”).

NÜWA
Nüwa is the Great Mother of humans, a culture heroine, and one of the most
important and powerful primeval goddesses in Chinese mythology. She repaired
the broken sky and created human beings by molding them from yellow earth.
In other versions she married her brother and propagated humans.
Nüwa’s name appears as early as the late Warring States era in two ancient
pieces of Chinese literature, Shanhaijing and “Tianwen” in Chuci. In the former
record, Nüwa’s gut turned into ten spirits, and each took different routes and
settled into the wilderness. Her mythic action was even more vague and enig

matic in the latter recording, in which there was a question raised about her cre
ation: “Who shaped the body of Nüwa?” This was interpreted by many scholars
as “Nüwa has created humans, but who created her?” These written interpreta
tions of the story that Nüwa’s insides turned into spirits imply that Nüwa was
the creator of humans.
Nüwa’s mythical role and achievements are clearer in records from the Han
dynasty. According to Huainanzi, Nüwa repaired the broken sky. The four poles
supporting the sky collapsed at some point in remote antiquity. The record in
Huainanzi does not explain why this disaster occurred. In other texts, this cos
mic disorder was said to be caused by a war between the gods Gonggong and
Zhuanxu. Gonggong lost in the war, and he was so angry that he butted into
Mount Buzhou (literally meaning “Not Full”), one of the four pillars supporting
the sky. This version of the myth explaining how the sky fell states that only
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 171
Nüwa creates humans. A folk paper-cutting made by Miao ethnic people. (From Yang Lihui, Rethinking on the Source Area of the Cult of Nüwa, Beijing Shifan Daxue Chubanshe, 1999, 23)



one pillar fell, not all four pillars, as stated in Huainanzi. Because this story con
flicts with the description in Huainanzi, some scholars are suspicious of their
logical connection and argue that they may be two separate myths.
The collapse of the sky caused great cosmic chaos. Fires raged fiercely and
could not be extinguished. Water overran everywhere and did not ebb away. The
violent birds and fierce beasts seized and devoured people. At this crucial mo
ment, Nüwa melted stones of five different colors to patch the sky, and cut the
legs off a huge tortoise and set them up to support the four extremities of the
sky. Then she defeated the ferocious Black Dragon to save the people, and col
lected ashes of reeds to stop the flood. Her arduous work cleared up the chaos
and put the world in order again. In some versions collected in the twentieth
century, Nüwa not only mended the broken sky but also repaired the broken
earth that was damaged in the same disaster. Her mythical actions serve as an
etiology to explain why people today can see colorful clouds in the sky, and why
the western land of China is high while the east is low: Nüwa used colorful
stones to patch the sky, and she used the longer legs of the tortoise to support
the west, and the shorter legs to support the east.
Another ancient writing, Fengsu Tongyi (Popular Customs and Traditions,
second century CE), records another well-known myth relating to Nüwa. Nüwa
created human beings by molding them from yellow earth with her hands, since
the sky and the earth had been created but no humans yet existed. The work
drained her strength and took a lot of time, so she took a cord and pulled it
through the mud, then she lifted the cord and shook it. All of the sludge that fell
down from the cord became men and women. Thus, rich and noble people were
those made by Nüwa’s hands, while poor and lowly people were those made by
Nüwa dragging a cord through the mud.
A different explanation of the origin of humans, which appears comprehen
sively in Duyizhi (A Treatise on Strange Beings and Things, by Tang dynasty
writer Li Rong, ca. 846–874 CE), involves Nüwa’s brother-sister marriage. At the
very beginning of the world, there were no other people except for Nüwa and her
older brother. They lived on the mythical mountain Kunlun. They wanted to be
come husband and wife so that they might have children and populate the earth,
but they felt shamed by this because of their blood relationship. They prayed to
heaven from the top of the mountain: “If Thou wouldst send us two forth as man
and wife, then make this smoke gather. If not, then make the smoke disperse.”
The smoke gathered immediately, so they got married. However, Nüwa still felt
very shy and ashamed, so she weaved grass into a fan to cover her face (which ex
plains why brides often hold fans during their wedding ceremonies).
Today, Nüwa’s myths are still orally spread in modern China. Compared to
those myths mentioned above that come from classical texts, most of her mod
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
172



ern myths are the same type while differing in their details and explanations. For
example, myths relating to Nüwa’s brother-sister marriage today are widely
spread with many versions in different ethnic groups, such as the Miao, Yao,
Tujia, and Shui. In these versions Nüwa and her brother, often Fuxi, divined to
decide whether they should marry to re-create human beings, usually after a
great flood. They both agreed if certain things happened, they should get married.
First, they rolled two pieces of a millstone down different sides of a mountain,
and if the two pieces were recovered, they should marry. Then, they each lit a fire
from different places. If the two lines of smoke joined each other instead of dis
persing, they should marry. Other trials included one person taking a thread
while the other took a needle, and if the needle could be threaded from a long dis
tance, they should marry. If the broken shell of a tortoise could be restored, they
should marry. The sister ran around a mountain and her brother ran after her. If
he caught her, they should marry. Of course, these things all happened perfectly,
so the two were married. A popular ending of this type of myth often serves to
explain the origin of the Chinese Baijiaxing (literally “100 family names,” mean
ing the main surnames of Chinese). After their marriage, Nüwa gave birth to a
spherical piece of flesh. The couple felt so strange about this that they cut the
flesh into small pieces and scattered these pieces in the woods. When the pieces
touched different species of trees, they turned into human beings. Those people
who touched the Li tree (plum tree) took Li as their surname, those people who
touched the Tao tree (peach tree) took Tao as their surname, and so on. In cen
tral China, including Henan and Hebei provinces, this myth type often ends
with an explanation of the origin of disabled people. After Nüwa and Fuxi were
married, they created men and women by molding them in clay. Then they dried
the wet models in the sun. While they were drying, it began to rain. So they hur
riedly swept the models with a broom into a dustpan and carried them into the
cave. During this process, some models lost their legs or arms and some were
hurt in the eyes and ears. That is why there are both healthy people and disabled
people today in this world.
Whereas these contemporary myths are similar to those in ancient record
ings, there are other new types of Nüwa myths that are not found in classical lit
erature. In one version collected in Sichuan Province in the 1980s, Nüwa was
said to help Shennong, the Divine Farmer, to solve a difficulty of his. The Divine
Farmer sowed grain at the beginning of his many seeding works, but it grew into
chaff. He did not know what to do. Nüwa squeezed out some of her milk into
the empty shell at noon. The chaff began to grow grain from then on, and it al
ways flowers at noon. In another myth collected in the same province, Nüwa
later became a member of a systematic pantheon of gods and saved her children
for the second time. The supreme god Yu Di (the Jade Emperor) ordered the God
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 173



of Plague to extinguish humans on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. As the
creator of humankind, Great Mother Nüwa wanted to stop him from doing this.
Accepting the Bodhisattva Guanyin’s suggestion, Nüwa told every family in the
world to hang some mugwort wormwoods outside their doors. When the God of
Plagues went down from heaven to the earth, he saw wild grass everywhere. He
thought there were no people living there, so he went back without killing any
one. From then on, people hang mugwort wormwoods outside their doors on
May 5 according to the lunar calendar, which forms the main custom in the Du
anwu Festival.
Besides these divine deeds, Nüwa also was the first go-between, or Supreme
Matchmaker. She encouraged males and females to marry each other in order to
have children. Because of marriage between men and women there was no more
need for Nüwa to create humans from mud. Nüwa also invented some musical
instruments, such as the shenghuang (a reed-pipe wind instrument) and xiao (a
vertical bamboo flute), to entertain the children she created.
Nüwa was depicted in early Chinese literature as having a lady’s head and a
serpent’s body. In most grave paintings of the Han dynasty, she often appeared
with her brother, Fuxi. Both had human heads and serpent bodies, with their
tails often weaving together. She gradually became an elegant and graceful god
dess in later developments.
Corresponding with her noble status in mythology, Nüwa also takes a high
position in Chinese beliefs. She was respected in some ancient literature as one
of the Three Divine Sovereigns. The other two sovereigns usually are Fuxi and
Shennong (different names are given in different texts). In the dynasties of Song,
Ming, and Qing, she was offered sacrifices by the feudal governments.
Today, Nüwa is still an important goddess in some regions. In Shexian
County, Hebei Province, there is a large temple called Wa Huang Gong (The
Palace of Empress Nüwa). Nüwa is said to have patched the broken sky and cre
ated humans here in this county. Every year from February 15 to March 18 in
the lunar calendar, people gather here to worship Nüwa, their “great-grand
mother.” Most of the pilgrims come from local counties of Hebei Province;
some may even come from Henan and Shanxi provinces. March 15 is said to be
Nüwa’s birthday. From the late afternoon of March 14 until the early morning of
March 15, the pilgrims sit in the yard and inside the palace, which is locally
called zuoye (sitting during the night). Some sing sacred songs for Nüwa. Some
dance for her. By accompanying their great-grandmother during her birthday,
they believe they will get Nüwa’s blessing and all they hope for children, health,
safety, and happiness.
In Huaiyang County, Henan Province, there is a temple complex called the
Tomb of Tai Hao, popularly called Renzu Temple (Temple of Human Ancestors).
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
174



From lunar February 2 to March 3, the monthlong Renzu Festival at the Renzu
Temple complex is held to celebrate Fuxi’s birthday. Although Fuxi is the main
god worshiped during the festival, Nüwa is also worshiped. Some female pil
grims make embroidered shoes and bring them to Nüwa. They call the shoes
Nüwa’s Shoes. They sacrifice the shoes to Nüwa by displaying them in Renzu
Temple or burning them with incense, paper money, or paper buildings (in
tended as ancestors’ dwellings). Women often dance danjingtiao (wherein a pole
is carried over one’s shoulder) for their ancestors. This local folk dance is some
times called danhualan (“carrying flower baskets on shoulder”). It is usually
danced by women and passed on matrilineally.
There is a local legend explaining the origin of this dance and the reason
why only women can dance it. After Nüwa repaired the broken sky, she mistak
enly reincarnated (transmigrated) into a black dog. Her daughter missed her very
much, but she did not know where her mother was. So she made two flower bas
kets and put them on her shoulder, and then she traveled and danced in many
places to look for her mother. At last, she found her mother Nüwa and rescued
her. Therefore, women imitate Nüwa’s daughter and dance the danjingtiao to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 175

worship and give sacrifice to Nüwa. The one who dances well is considered to
have true filial piety and thus can receive more blessings from Nüwa.

PANGU
In Chinese mythology, Pangu (pan means “coil up,” and gu means “antiquity”)
is the creator of the world, the first divine human who was miraculously born
within the cosmos egg. It is he who separates heaven and earth, and when he
dies, his body transforms into the universe.
Though Pangu created the world, his myth did not appear in ancient Chi
nese literature until as late as the Three Kingdoms era. According to Sanwu Liji
(Historical Records of the Three Sovereign Divinities and the Five Gods, third
century CE), Pangu was born in chaos and grew up while shaping the heaven and
the earth. At the very beginning, heaven and earth were in chaotic formlessness
like a chicken’s egg. Within this chaos Pangu was born. After 18,000 years, the
egg somehow opened and unfolded. The limpid and light part of it rose and then
became heaven, while the turbid and heavy part of it sank down and became the
earth. Pangu lived inside heaven and earth. One day he transformed many times
and became more divine than heaven and more sacred than earth. Each day
heaven rose ten feet higher, the earth grew ten feet thicker, and Pangu grew ten
feet taller. This situation lasted for another 18,000 years. By then heaven was ex
tremely high, the earth was extremely deep, and Pangu was extremely tall. Then
there appeared the Three Sovereigns, who were the earliest divine lords in Chi
nese mythical history.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
176



In other variants orally transmit
ted in contemporary China, Pangu cre
ated heaven and earth by stretching
himself and shattering the egg’s shell
into pieces while he was confined in
the egg-shaped chaos. The egg white is
light, so it became heaven, and the
yolk is heavy, so it became earth.
Some versions even relate that Pangu
cut the connection between heaven
and the earth with an adze and chisel.
In order to keep heaven and earth from
merging again after he separated them,
Pangu himself served as a huge pillar
by standing between them.
Another great deed of Pangu is
that his body transformed into the
universe after his death. This was first
recorded in Wuyun Linianji (A Chroni
cle of the Five Circles of Time, third
century CE), a book compiled during
the Three Kingdoms era. When Pangu
was dying, his body began to trans
form: his breath became the winds and
clouds, his voice became the thunder, his left eye became the sun, his right eye
became the moon, his four limbs and trunk became the four extremes of the
earth and the Five Mountains, his blood became the rivers, his veins became the
earth’s arteries, his flesh became fields and soil, his hair and beard became the
stars, his skin and body hair became plants, his teeth and bones became various
metals and rocks, his semen and marrow became pearls and jade, his sweat be
came the rain and the dew, and the various insects on his body reacted to the
wind and turned into human beings.
The Pangu myth is widespread. Besides being known to Han people, his
myth is also well-known to the Miao, Yao, Lisu, Gelao, Bai, Buyi, Zhuang, and
many other ethnic groups. Today people continue to tell the Pangu myth, and its
details vary. In some versions Pangu’s two main deeds are combined and system
atized, and the stories are much more elaborate than those recorded in ancient
literature. Moreover, many myths tell about other divine actions of Pangu. One
popular version associates Pangu with the brother-sister marriage myth type.
Pangu and his sister survived a great flood that destroyed all other people, so
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 177
Pangu, the creator of the world and the first divine human who was miraculously born within the cosmos egg. (From Wang Qi and Wang Erbin, comps., Sancaituhui, Jinchang Baohanlou Kanben, 1609. Preserved in the Library of Literature Institute, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)



they married each other in order to re create human beings. They subsequently
bore a lot of children and then were worshiped as parents of human beings.
A myth told by people in Henan Province in central China describes Pangu
as the protector of humankind and the manager of the world. This myth states
that the world was still in dimness after Pangu created humans. Pangu was wor
ried about it and had been thinking of a solution for a long time. One day he was
attracted to a gleam of light from the east. Along the light beam he found two
beautiful sisters. One had fair skin, and the other appeared to glow. The fair one
was the elder; her name was Moon, and her sister’s name was Sun. Their clothes
were made of brilliant golden and silver silk, which lit the whole place where
they stayed. Pangu invited them to light the world by standing on the top of a
high mountain. The two sisters agreed. Then Pangu suggested to them that they
each appear in turn by daytime and nighttime. Sun was afraid of the darkness
and did not go out during the night. She also was ashamed to show herself in
front of people during the daytime, so her elder sister, Moon, gave her a handful
of golden needles. She told Sun that with the needles she could prick the eyes of
those who dared to stare at her. From then on, the two sisters gave light to the
world day and night.
In another myth spread throughout Gansu Province in northwestern China,
Pangu is associated with the mythical cause of earthquakes. In order to separate
heaven and earth, Pangu asked a god to lift heaven and tried to find another
spirit to hold up the earth. Since the earth was very heavy, Pangu molded an ox
with clay and his own saliva. He blew on the clay ox and it came alive. Then
this divine ox was made to carry the earth. Additionally, Pangu molded a clay
rooster as a supervisor to keep the ox from falling asleep so as to keep the earth
from sinking. After thousands of years of supporting the earth on its back, the ox
felt so tired that it wished to take a nap. But the rooster insisted on fulfilling
Pangu’s instruction and did not allow it. The ox was so annoyed that it shook its
head and body three times. As a result, the earth on the back of the ox shook as
well. That is the origin of earthquakes.
Pangu’s appearance is first depicted in Wuyun Linianji. He is described as
having a dragon’s head and a serpent’s trunk. In some versions collected today,
Pangu is described as a giant with a cat’s head, a serpent’s trunk, and a tiger’s
paw. In these myths his extraordinary figure corresponds to his super power.
However, in portraits and temple statues, Pangu usually appears as a manlike
giant with a horn. A myth told by people in Henan Province gives an explana
tion for the horn on Pangu’s head. In Pangu’s time, all people were horned. They
used the horn as a weapon in hunting. Moreover, the horn had the very impor
tant function of providing a signal at one’s time of death. When a person was
dying, his horn would get soft and loose. Usually people worked very hard at
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
178



hunting, but a person who felt his horn become soft and loose would cease
working to wait for death. During a later period, there were so many people
whose horns got soft and loose that few people were working. This annoyed the
God of Heaven. He sent divine troops and took back the horn of humankind.
From then on, ordinary people had no horns, and they became much more in
dustrious than ever before. However, the divine Pangu kept his own horn and
mythical powers.
As creator of the universe, Pangu receives a high status in Chinese beliefs.
Several temples were built for him in Henan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang
provinces, and in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Many of them were
founded before Tang or Song times. In these regions, Pangu continues to be wor
shiped by people today. For instance, in the Tongbai Mountains region of Henan
Province, there is a large Pangu temple on the top of Mount Pangu, which is said
to be the former residence of Pangu. During special occasions and ordinary ones,
people of this vicinity often go to the temple to worship Pangu, the great god.
Every March 3 of the lunar calendar there is a huge temple fair. Pilgrims from
rural areas in Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Hubei, Anhui, and Shandong
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 179

provinces gather here to pay religious homage and offer sacrifices to the god
Pangu. These activities actually will last seven or eight days, from March 1 to
March 7 or 8. It is said that the number of pilgrims may amount to nearly
100,000. During the fair, besides visiting the temple, people will perform dramas
for Pangu for several days and nights. Many people believe that every time dra
mas are performed, it will rain. They explain that this is because Pangu wants to
wash off the garbage many people leave at the fair. This explanation can be con
joined with another of Pangu’s mythical powers that people of this vicinity be
lieve in, that Pangu has a special power to create rain three times each year. Ac
cording to popular Chinese belief, it is only the supreme god, the Jade Emperor,
who has the right to send rain. Those gods who create rain without the Jade Em
peror’s permission will receive a severe penalty. However, some gods who take
charge in affairs that are vital to human beings, or who have made great contri
butions to gods or humankind, will be given special permission by the Supreme
God to create rain several times a year. By praying to these gods in times of
drought, people may receive rain. Pangu himself belongs to this special group of
gods for his great deeds. That is why drought seldom occurs in the Tongbai
Mountains region where Pangu is worshiped. Similar beliefs can also be seen in
Yudu County, Jiangxi Province. It is said that Yudu used to suffer from heavy
droughts each year. However, since a Pangu temple was built, this area has al
ways received favorable weather.
Based on the fact that the Pangu myth was not recorded in literature until as
late as the Three Kingdoms era, some Chinese scholars believe that the Pangu
myth migrated from non-Han Chinese culture. One of the hypotheses links the
Pangu myth to the Panhu myth, the ancestral myth of the Miao, Yao, She, and
Li ethnic groups in southern China. Panhu was a dog of Di Ku, a mythical Chi
nese sovereign. When Di Ku got into trouble during an invasion, it was Panhu
that brought the enemy general’s head to Di Ku and thus helped him to win the
war. As a reward that had been previously promised by its imperial master,
Panhu received the emperor’s daughter as his wife. The dog then carried the
princess to mountains in southern China, where they created children who be
came the ancestors of the Miao, Yao, She, and Li ethnic groups. However, except
for the phonetic similarity between “Pangu” and “Panhu,” the two types of
myths are actually quite different in theme. Another important assumption sup
poses that the Pangu myth originated in India. In the Rig Veda and Aitareya
Upanishad, as well as several other texts of the Sutra, stories similar to Pangu’s
two great deeds are recorded. Nevertheless, many Chinese scholars insist that
the Pangu myth is of Han Chinese origin. A deity recorded in two texts in Shan
haijing is thought to be the prototype of the Pangu figure. This deity is called
Zhulong (“Torch Dragon”) or Zhuyin (“Torch Shadow”). He was a god with a
Handbook of Chinese Mythology

human face and a serpent’s trunk, and his body was a thousand miles in length.
When his eyes opened there was daylight, and when they closed it became night;
his hard breath made winter and his hot exhalation made summer. His appear
ance and abilities are almost the same as Pangu’s. Hence, it is argued that Pangu
possibly evolved from this god. Shanhaijing was compiled much earlier than the
time when the Panhu myth was first recorded, and also earlier than the time
when Indian tradition had an impact on Chinese culture. Some scholars have
suggested that instead of looking for the non-Han Chinese origin of the Pangu
myth, the myth actually could be traced to its pure Han Chinese root. Moreover,
modern Chinese mythologists also have found that the two fundamental
themes contained in the Pangu myth, the theme of the universe starting from an
egg-shaped chaos and the theme of a dying deity’s body transforming into the
universe, correspond with cardinal concepts in ancient Chinese mythology and
cosmology. These ideas, such as the notion that the universe started from chaos
and that there are correspondences between humans and the universe, can be
found as early as the Zhou dynasty. This is thought to provide additional sup
port for Pangu’s Han Chinese origin.

PILLARS OF THE SKY
The pillars of the sky are huge pillars that support the sky, keeping it from col
lapsing or swinging into the earth. They are sometimes used to separate the sky
from the earth.
The motif of “supporting the sky” is worldwide. In China, the motif of sky
pillars is also widely spread in many myths. It can be found in Han, Naxi, Yi,
Miao, Yao, Bai, Luoba, and other ethnic groups. The number of the sky pillars
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 181



may be different in various stories. It may be four, five, eight, or sometimes
twelve. The main functions of the sky pillars are to support the sky so that it
doesn’t fall down, to keep it from swinging out of place, and to separate the
heaven from the earth. The pillars may be huge mountains, trees, stone pillars,
turtle feet, tiger bones, a deity’s body or human’s body, a deity’s corpse, or pillars
made of gold and silver, jade, pearl, iron, and the like.
Corresponding with pillars of the sky, there are also pillars of the earth,
which function to protect the earth from collapsing or swinging. They some
times appear together with the sky pillars in some myths.
One of the earliest recordings about the sky pillars appears in “Tianwen,”
the written treasure of Chinese mythology. In it, the distinguished poet Qu
Yuan expressed his doubt about the sky pillar myth: “Where are the eight sky
pillars? Why is there a gap in the southeast?” “Why did the earth tilt toward the
southeast during the rage of Kanghui [another name for Gonggong]?” This illus
trates that myths about eight sky pillars, and one of them being ruined by the
deity Gonggong, were current in the late Warring States era.
During the Han dynasty and thereafter, myths about sky pillars were very
detailed. One known myth states that in remote antiquity, the four poles of the
sky collapsed, and this caused great cosmic chaos. Fires raged fiercely and could
not be put out. Rivers overran their banks and did not decline. Violent birds and
fierce beasts seized and devoured people. At this moment, the goddess Nüwa
melted stones of five different colors to patch the sky, and she cut the legs off a
huge tortoise and set them up to support the four extremities of the sky. Then
she defeated the ferocious Black Dragon to save the people and collected the
ashes of reeds to stop the flood. Her arduous work cleared up the chaos and put
the world in order again.
Another popular myth holds that one of the sky pillars was Mount Buzhou,
but it was damaged by the water god Gonggong in his contest with another
deity, Zhuanxu (or Zhurong, Di Ku, or Shengnong; various names are given in
different versions), to be the Supreme Sovereign.
These two myths are sometimes associated with each other, but with con
siderable differences. According to Lunheng (Critical Essays, written by Wang
Chong, ca. 27–100 CE) and “Bu Shiji Sanhuang Benji” (“Biographies of the Three
Divine Sovereigns: A Supplement to the Historical Records,” Tang dynasty), the
Gonggong story is followed by that of Nüwa. The recording in “Bu Shiji San
huang Benji” combined various myth versions and tried to form a coherent an
cient history, thus: toward the end of Nüwa’s reign, Gonggong fought with
Zhurong, the God of Fire, but failed. He was so angry that he struck his head
against Mount Buzhou and caused this sky pillar to collapse, which snapped the
cords holding up the earth. To repair this damage, Nüwa melted stones of five
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
182



different colors to mend the sky, and cut the legs off a huge tortoise and set
them up to support the four corners of the sky (somehow she reestablished four
sky columns instead of one). Then she collected ashes of reeds to stop the flood.
Through her effort, Nüwa cleared up the chaos and put the world in order again.
However, in texts from Liezi (which was said to have been written in the War
ring States era but probably was gathered from some original texts and rewritten
in the Jin dynasty, 265–420 CE) and Bowuzhi (A Treatise on Research into Na
ture, Jin dynasty), the chronological order of these two stories is reversed. That
is, Nüwa repaired the broken sky first and supported it with four sky columns,
then later Gonggong ruined one of the columns and destroyed the normal estab
lished order. Gonggong’s damage often served as an etiological myth about the
current Chinese topography. Since then, the sky tilts toward the northwest, and
that is why the sun, moon, and stars move in that direction. Earth sinks toward
the southeast, and that is why the rivers of China flow toward the ocean in the
east. The loose connection between these two stories suggests that they might
have been independent of each other in early stages of the myths and were
loosely combined later.
The sky pillars myths are quite rich among other ethnic groups. A myth col
lected in the 1990s from the Yi people in Xinping County, Yunnan Province,
says that at the very beginning, the sky had not been separated from the earth,
and the gods lived together with humans. Because the living space was limited,
the gods and humans worked together and made four gold pillars. They used the
pillars to sever the sky from the earth, and then the gods lived on high in
heaven, and humans lived below on earth. And this formed the basic order of the
universe.
A famed Miao creation epic, “Ancient Songs of Miao People” (“Miaozu
Guge”), vividly describes in detail the reason for setting up the twelve pillars of
sky and earth, the process of making and fixing them, the divine persons who
made them, and the places where they are set. This epic is usually sung by two
or more singers (one asks questions, and the others answer) on the occasions of
traditional festivals and special ceremonies such as weddings or funerals. One
version of the epic, which was collected from Guizhou Province and was trans
lated from the Miao language into Chinese and published in the 1990s, goes,
In remote antiquity, what kind of pillar supported the sky?
What kind of pillar supported the earth
So that the sky and the earth would not collapse?
In remote antiquity, the sky was supported by the Wubei Tree,
And the earth was supported by the Wormwood Tree,
So that the sky became round,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 183



And it would not collapse. . . .
A man named Jinsong’ang,
He was very clever.
He had nine arms and nine hands,
Nine legs and nine knees.
He could ascend up to heaven,
And he could descend down to the earth.
He ascended up to the sky and jostled it,
He jostled the outside and inside of the sky,
He jostled the east and the west of the sky,
He looked carefully at the sky,
And he looked carefully at the earth,
The sky was still unstable;
The earth was still unstable. . . .
Fufang was smart,
Fufang had great strength,
He pulled out the Wubei Tree,
He pulled out the Wormwood Tree.
He used the silver pillars to support the sky,
And the gold pillars to support the earth.
The sky then became stable,
The earth then became stable. . . .
The steelyard was smart,
It was the go-between.
It borrowed silver from Grandfather Bao,
It borrowed ten thousand ba [one ba equals the amount held in one palm] of
silver,
To make a silver pillar,
A silver pillar to support the sky.
It borrowed millions of liang [one liang equals 0.05 kilogram] of gold,
To make a gold pillar,
A gold pillar to support the sky. . . .
There were Grandpa Bao and Grandpa Xiong,
There were Grandpa Qi and Grandpa Dang,
The four grandpas,
The four to make the pillars. . . .
The first hit they hammered like a bird flying,
The second hit they hammered like the snow flying in the air,
The hammer hit swiftly like a whirlwind.
The third hit caused the level ground to sink,
The level ground sank into a deep hollow. . . .
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
184



They used up the ten thousand ba of silver,
They had been working for twelve days and nights,
And they made twelve pillars. . . .
Fufang was smart,
Fufang set up the pillars.
The pillars supported the sky straightly,
The pillars supported the earth straightly. . . .
The first pillar was set up at Taigong,
The second pillar was set up at Fangxi,
The third pillar was set up at Wengyang,
The fourth pillar was set up at Deyen,
The fifth pillar was set up at Xennin,
The sixth pillar was set up at Paijiu,
The seventh pillar was set up at Paile,
The eighth pillar was set up at the sea.
Then there were four pillars left,
They were all cut off two meters,
Then one was used to support the east,
The second one was used to support the west,
The third one was used to support the left,
And the fourth one was used to support the right.
When the twelve pillars were all set up,
The sky became round,
The earth became stable. . . .
Another version of this epic mentions the change of the sky columns. After
the twelve pillars were erected, a drought arrived on the earth. Because the pil
lars were all the same height, the rain could not fall down. To solve the problem,
the four grandfathers cut about one meter (about 3.3 feet) off the gold pillars in
the east; meanwhile, they extended the pillars in the west by one half of a meter.
In this way, the sky tilted toward the east and the rain began to fall onto the
earth, and the land was not dry anymore.

QI
The founder of the Shang people and the son of Di Ku, Qi was miraculously born
by Jiandi after she ingested a swallow’s egg and became pregnant.
The most well-known Qi myth is perhaps his birth story. Like most heroes
and gods in Chinese mythology, Qi’s birth was miraculous. According to a text
in Shiji, Qi’s mother was Jiandi, who was a daughter of the Yousong clan and the
second concubine of Di Ku. One day Jiandi went out to take a bath with Di Ku
and another person and she saw a swallow dropping an egg. She picked it up and
swallowed it. Then she inexplicably became pregnant and later gave birth to Qi.
When Qi grew up, he helped Yu restrain the great flood. As a reward, he was be
stowed the fief of Shang by the sage king Shun. Later he and his state became
very powerful and prosperous.
Another version recorded in Shiyiji (chapter 2) is more mystical. It says that
at the beginning of the Shang dynasty, a divine woman named Jiandi traveled in
the field. She found a black bird dropping its only egg. There were two colorful
words written on it, “eight hundred.” Jiandi picked it up, covered it with a red
silk belt, and protected it under a jade basket. During that night, she dreamed
that a mother goddess told her, “You possess this egg, and thus you will give
birth to a great son. He will inherit the emblem of Metal” (according to the the
ory of five elements, the Shang dynasty belongs to metal, jin). Jiandi then held
the egg to her bosom. After one year, she became pregnant. After fourteen more
months, she gave birth to Qi, the founder of the Shang dynasty. As the goddess
predicted, the Shang dynasty lasted for 800 years (in fact, historically, the Shang
dynasty lasted for approximately 600 years).
Other versions say that Qi was so distinctive and extraordinary, like Yu and
Houji, that when he was born, he came out from his mother’s back, or breast, in
stead of her belly.

SHAOHAO
One of the most notable supreme gods in Chinese mythology, Shaohao founded
his capital in the east, but later was known as the god who reigns over the west
and controls the season of autumn. He is also known as Jintianshi (literally mean
ing “Metal Sky”), Zhi, Zhuxuan, and Baidi (“White God”; according to the theory
of five elements and five colors, the west belongs to metal, and its color is white).
Like most gods in Chinese mythology, Shaohao experienced a miraculous
birth, which functions as testimony to his extraordinary and supernatural quali
ties. One version of his birth story states that during the time of Huang Di, a big
star shining like a rainbow fell down to the Hua Islet. A divine lady named
Nüjie caught it in her dream. Then she got pregnant and later gave birth to Shao
hao (Zhuxuan). Another version maintains that he was the son of Jin Xing (the
planet Venus) and a beautiful divine lady named Huang’e. Appearing in the Jin
dynasty book Shiyiji (Researches into Lost Records), the story states that Shao
hao’s mother, Huang’e (literally meaning a beautiful divine woman), lived in a
jade palace and wove at night. Sometimes, during the day, she traveled far away
by a raft to the boundless reach of Qiongsang, which, in that story, was located
on the shore of the west sea. There was a mulberry tree on the shore. It was
8,000 feet in height, and it produced fruit every 10,000 years. If one ate its fruit,
one was able to live even longer than heaven. At that time, there was a hand
some child-god named “the Son of White God” (here Shaohao became the grand
son of White God instead of being the White God himself) who actually was the
spirit of Jin Xing (the planet Venus) descended at Qiongsang. He feasted and
played with Huang’e. They floated on the sea; meanwhile they played fantastic
music and sang songs in response to each other. To discern the wind direction,
they set up a mast in the front of their raft, tied thatched grass to the mast as a
flag, and carved a jade cuckoo bird on the top of the mast, because the cuckoo
bird knew the four seasons. What they did originated the custom of
xiangfeng (whereby people carve a wooden or copper bird and then put it on the
top of their roofs or masts to discern the wind direction). Later Huang’e gave
birth to Shaohao. He was also named Qiongsangshi or Jintianshi (shi here is a re
spectful title for gods and nobles). Since five colorful phoenixes came to his yard
when he was born, he was also called Fengniaoshi (meaning “Phoenix Bird”).
Though the text from Shiyiji asserts that Shaohao was born in the west,
some ancient writings show that he perhaps originated in the east. An account
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 187



recorded in Shizi (which was said to have been written during the Warring States
era but now is known only in later quotations) holds that Shaohao founded his
state at Qiongsang. The five colors of the sun’s light shone and enlightened that
place. Some Chinese scholars deduced that Qiongsang should be a place close to
Qufu, which now belongs to modern Shandong Province, in eastern China (Yuan
1996, 170; Rao 1996, 67). Shaohao Mausoleum was built in Qufu city (according
to local legend, during the Song dynasty) and remains there today, just east of
Qufu city. Another text in Shanhaijing (chapter 14) not only links Shaohao with
the east but connects him to Zhuanxu, one of the supreme gods in ancient
times. Beyond the east sea was a huge valley. That was the state of Shaohao,
where Shaohao nursed Zhuanxu. Some musical instruments once played by
young Zhuanxu and later abandoned could be found there.
As for Shaohao’s state, perhaps the most notable and striking character of it
is that he named all of his officials by using the names of birds. A text recorded
in Zuozhuan (Chronicle of Zuo, Duke Zhao, 17th Year) described that when
Shaohao founded his state, phoenixes appeared. He thus decided to give his sub
ordinates bird names. For example, Fengniaoshi (meaning “Phoenix Bird”) took
charge of the calendar, Xuanniaoshi (“Swallow”) took charge of the equinoxes,
Bozhaoshi (“Butcherbird”) took charge of the summer and winter solstices,
Qingniaoshi (“Green Bird”) took charge of the beginnings of spring and summer,
and Danniaoshi (“Red Bird”) took charge of the beginnings of autumn and win
ter. Besides these five officials, Shaohao named his officers “five Jiu” (five kinds
of doves) to preside over assembling people, while the “five Zhi” (five kinds of
pheasants) would preside over the handicraft industry and “nine Hu birds”
would preside over agriculture. Yuan Ke argues that this story has been heavily
historicized. He writes that the Shaohao story is in fact a myth and that Shaohao
was a divine vulture bird who founded a bird kingdom beyond the east sea,
while all his officials were actually assumed by types of birds (Yuan 1996,
174–175).
However, in later tradition, Shaohao became known as a supreme god who
reigned over the west and controlled the season of autumn. According to a text
in Shanhaijing (chapter 2), the god Shaohao, or White God, lived on a western
mountain named Changliu (“Long Flow”). All the beasts there had spotted tails,
and all the birds had spotted heads. The mountain was rich in jade with veins
running through it. There Shaohao’s function was to observe the condition of
the sunset. Another text from Huainanzi (chapter 3) also sets Shaohao in the
west and, furthermore, puts him alongside four divine emperors in an orderly
pantheon distributed in five directions (east, south, west, north, and center) and
five elements (wood, fire, metal, water, and earth). It states,
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
188



The East belongs to Wood. Its god is Taihao. His subordinate is Goumang. Both
of them hold the compasses and control the season of spring. The South belongs
to Fire. Its god is Yan Di. His subordinate is Zhuming. Both of them hold the
beams of steelyards and control the season of summer. The Center belongs to
Earth. Its god is Huang Di. His subordinate is Houtu. Both of them hold the
ropes and control the four directions. The West belongs to Metal. Its god is
Shaohao. His subordinate is Rushou. Both of them hold the carpenter’s squares
and control the season of autumn. The North belongs to Water. Its god is
Zhuanxu. His subordinate is Xuanming. Both of them hold the sliding weights
of steelyards and control the season of winter.
Some scholars believe that with the branches of the Shaohao clan migrating
from east to west, the Shaohao myth was thus transmitted, diffused, and in
evitably changed in the west. For this reason, Shaohao was transformed from a
god who founded his bird kingdom in the east into a god who reigned over the
west and autumn (Yuan 1996, 177; Yuan 1993, 162; Rao 1996, 67–68).
Shaohao has some famous relatives and subordinates. Besides Zhuanxu,
mentioned above, who is Shaohao’s nephew, there are also Rushou, Qiongqi, and
Ban. Rushou is Shaohao’s minor deity who assisted Shaohao in ruling the west
and autumn. A legend recorded in Guoyu depicted Rushou as a deity with a
human face, tiger’s paws, and white fur, holding a broad axe. He followed the
Supreme Divinity’s order and predicted the extinction of the Guo state. In some
versions, the name “Rushou” refers to a title for the official of metal (Jinzheng)
instead of a certain deity. A text from Zuozhuan (Duke Zhao, 29th Year) states
that Shaohao had four younger brothers (other versions say four sons), named
Zhong, Gai, Xiu, and Xi. They understood the principles of metal, wood, and
water. So Zhong was appointed as Goumang (Official of Wood), Gai was Rushou
(Official of Metal), and Xiu and Xi were Xuanming (Official of Water). They all
did their best to do their duty, so they were helpful in the orderly administration
of Qiongsang.
Qiongqi is Shaohao’s unintelligent son. He is depicted in some ancient writ
ings as an animal shaped like a winged tiger (some versions say a dog or ox). He
was able to fly and understand human language. He ate people. He was so evil
that if he found two people fighting with each other, he would devour the righ
teous one; if he heard of someone faithful and loyal, he would bite the person’s
nose; if he heard of someone disobedient and evil, he would kill beasts to present
to him. So he was taken as one of the Four Evils (Si Xiong) and later was exiled
by the sage king Shun.
Unlike Qiongqi, another son of Shaohao, Ban, has more virtuous achieve
ments. He is said to have invented the bow and arrow.

SHENNONG
A popular culture hero who started agriculture, Chinese medicine, the market,
the Zhaji Sacrificial Rite, and also invented many farm tools and musical instru
ments, Shennong is one of the Three Divine Sovereigns along with Fuxi and
Huang Di (names may differ in different texts; some groups include the goddess
Nüwa). In his name, shen means “divine” or “sacred,” and nong means “farmer.”
Therefore, he can be called the Divine Farmer.
At the end of the Warring States era, Shennong was confused with another
renowned god, Yan Di. An example of this confusion can be found in Shiben
(The Origin of Hereditary Families, ca. third century BC). The two gods were
mixed together to make a new prominent god named Yan Di Shennongshi (shi
here is a respectful form of address for gods). However, this combination is com
paratively loose, and it influences the Shennong myth less than it does the Yan
Di myth. Since the Warring States period, Shennong and Yan Di have continued
to appear separately quite often, and Shennong still usually functions as a
farmer god (though he sometimes is nominally exhibited as Yan Di Shennong
shi), and the content of his myths predominantly refers to the invention of agri
culture and Chinese medicine. During the long developing process of his myth,
he is rarely depicted as having absorbed Yan Di’s main achievements, turning
into a god who reigns over the south and fights with Huang Di. By contrast, Yan
Di gradually takes Shennong’s basic mythological functions as his own. Thus
Yan Di shows up in later tradition not only as the God of the South and Spring,
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
190



the half brother of Huang Di who fought against Huang Di at Banquan, but also
as the God of Agriculture and Medicine by the title Yan Di Shennongshi.
As is widely known, China is a large agricultural country. It boasts a long
history of agriculture and a rich farming culture. For instance, China has several
gods of agriculture, such as Houji, Houtu, Shennong, and Shujun. Among them,
Shennong is the most well-known.
Shennong’s name and merit can be easily found in some ancient writings
from the Spring and Autumn period, such as Zhuangzi, Hanfeizi, and Guanzi
(which was said to have been written by a prominent politician, Guan Zhong, d.
645 BC, and later compiled by a Han scholar, Liu Xiang, ca. 77 BC–6 BC). From
then on, he received much fame and respect. Numerous myths, spreading both
in various written accounts and in oral tradition, describe his miraculous birth,
his unique features, and his great contributions to humans. In these myths,
Shennong is often portrayed as having the head of a dragon or sometimes the
head of an ox. Like most gods in Chinese mythology, Shennong also is the sub
ject of miraculous birth stories. One myth states that Shennong’s mother was
Shaodian’s wife (here we can find elements of the Yan Di myth mixed together
with the Shennong myth). Her name was Andeng (or Nüdeng in other versions).
One day, when she played in Huayang, a divine dragon copulated with her at the
place of Changyang. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Shennong.
Shennong had a human’s face and a dragon’s head. He liked to farm very much,
so he was called the Divine Farmer. Some versions say that when Shennong was
born, nine connecting wells were suddenly and unexpectedly excavated. If one
drew water from one of them, the water in the other eight wells would ripple.
Others say that when Shennong was three days old he could talk; after five days
he could walk; seven days later he had fully grown teeth; and after three years,
he knew everything about sowing and reaping.
The greatest mythical achievements Shennong made are devoted to agricul
ture. He is said to have first taught people to sow grain, and for this reason he was
respectfully addressed as the Divine Farmer. One version of his myth appearing in
Guanzi (chapter 64) holds that Shennong taught people to sow and to grow grain.
By this way he greatly benefited humans throughout the world. Another version
in the same book (chapter 84) maintains that Shennong planted grain to the south
of Mount Qi. From then on, people around the world began to understand the uses
of grain and used grain for subsistence. The whole world was changed by his con
tribution. According to a text from Huainanzi (chapter 19), in prehistoric times
people ate plants and drank from rivers. They gathered fruit from trees and ate
wasps and worms as their meat. They suffered from sickness, poison, and pain.
Hence Shennong taught people to sow the five grains (different names are given in
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 191



different explanations; this some
times refers to rice, two kinds of mil
let, wheat, and beans). He also
taught people to examine the land
and to cultivate it according to the
land’s quality (dry or wet, fertile or
barren, high or low, etc.). Another
story recorded in Xinyu (New Dis
course, written in the early Han dy
nasty) states that in ancient times
people took flesh and blood as their
food and drink, and raw animal fur
as their cloth. When it came to Shen
nong’s time, things began to change.
Shennong felt that it was very hard
for humans to live on reptiles and
beasts. So he went out to look for
better food. He tasted the fruits of
hundreds of plants and grasses and
recognized their sour or bitter fla
vors. After this process, he then
taught people to take the five grains
as their food.
Shennong’s great contributions
to agriculture are also shown in his
many inventions related to farming.
For example, he invented some im
portant farm tools such as the axe,
hoe, and leisi, a plowlike farm tool
used in ancient China. He cut wood
to make the plowshare, and he bent
a piece of wood to make the handle
of the plow. By using these tools, he
taught people to open wastelands and hoe weeds. He also taught people to exca
vate wells and irrigate land. He invented the age-old Chinese way of storing
grain seeds: he dipped the seeds in boiled horse urine to protect the seeds against
being eaten by worms. He invented the calendar and jieqi. (According to the
Chinese lunar calendar, the solar year can be divided into twenty-four seasonal
divisions, referred to as jieqi, which indicate the change of climate and timing

The inscription reads, “Shennongshi taught people to cultivate according to the land’s quality and to sow grains in order to relieve the hungry people.” (Feng Yunpeng and Feng Yunyuan, Research on Stone Carving, 1821)



for agricultural activities. They are of great significance to agriculture and are
still widely used in rural areas in China.)
Another of Shennong’s main contributions, which clearly derives from his
agricultural achievements, is that he created Chinese medicine. He tasted, or as it
is variously said, he thrashed with a reddish-brown whip hundreds of herbs in
order to figure out their medicinal characteristics and functions. Recordings about
this are quite abundant in ancient accounts. The text cited above from Huainanzi
further holds that Shennong tasted the flavors of hundreds of herbs and the sweet
ness or bitterness of the waters from rivers and wells. Then he told people what
they should eat and drink, and what they should avoid. This work was sometimes
dangerous. He once consumed seventy poisonous plants in one day. According to
a text from Soushenji (In Search of the Supernatural, written by Gan Bao, ca. 300
CE, chapter 1), Shennong thrashed hundreds of herbs with a reddish-brown whip.
Then he completely knew their flavors and properties of coldness, warmness,
mildness, and toxicity. Some versions say that Shennong tasted the flavors of
herbs and plants to find out their medicinal qualities, and then used them to cure
diseases. Additionally, he wrote an important ancient medical book, Shennong
Bencao Jing (Classic of Shennong’s Materia Medica, which was attributed to
Shennong but was probably written anonymously around the third century BC; it
was one of the earliest Chinese medical books). Some sources even suggest the
sites where Shennong tasted or thrashed the herbs. A text in Shuyiji (A Record of
Accounts of Marvels, written by Ren Fang, 460?–508? CE, chapter 2) states that the
tripod caldron that Shennong used to taste medicine could be found on the
Shenfugang (literally meaning the “Sacred Cauldron Hill”) of Taiyuan. On Mount
Chengyang, there is a place where Shennong purportedly whipped the herbs. The
spot came to be known as “Shennong Plain,” and the mountain was sometimes
called “Mount Medicinal Herb.” A Taoist temple named Ziyang was built on it.
For years it was popularly said that Shennong distinguished the medicinal herbs
there. Another version even depicts Shennong not only as the primogenitor of
Chinese traditional medicine but as a general practitioner of medicine as well.
This version maintains that Shennong was the first human to carefully study the
pulse conditions, discern the different characteristics of medicines, use the thera
pies of acupuncture and moxibustion, and write a medical book.
Besides these mythical achievements in agriculture and medicine, Shen
nong also gained fame for inventing many other cultural items. For example, he
made the pestle, mortar, bowl, pan, pot, rice steamer, well, and kitchen range.
People could then use these innovations to steep and steam rice.
Shennong is also credited with inventing the Zhaji Sacrificial Rite (later it
was called the Laji Rite), which was held at the end of each year in order to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 193



thank all the gods for enabling the harvest and to pray for another good harvest
in the coming year.
In another development, Shennong asked one of his subordinates to draw
pictures of water routes in order to prevent rivers from blocking up. He began to
measure lands and seas to set up hypsography (the study of elevation and topog
raphy). He also taught people to plant mulberry and hemp trees. People could
then make clothes from cloth and silk. He made the bow and arrow, and the
whole world was shocked by them. Additionally, Shennong invented some of
the most important ancient Chinese musical instruments, such as qin (a seven
stringed plucked instrument) and se (a twenty-five-stringed plucked instru
ment). He made them to help people to be calm, to keep their childlike inno
cence instead of being evil. He also composed a piece of music named “Fuchi” or
“Xiamou.” He created the sixty-four diagrams for divination. He also started a
market for trading—he told all people to come to a certain place at midday with
items that they could exchange for others.
Because of Shennong’s great contributions to humans, he was highly re
spected as one of the Three Divine Sovereigns, along with Fuxi, Nüwa, and
Huang Di. In some ancient writings Shennong was heavily rationalized into a
brilliant and accomplished sage king. “Shennong’s time” even became a symbol
of the ideal dynasty and golden era in mythical ancient Chinese history. This era
was thought to be happy, peaceful, stable, and self-sufficient. According to
Zhuangzi, the Shennong era was so fantastic that when people slept, they were
very quiet; when they were awake, they were happy. They only knew their
mother, and had no idea of their father. They lived alongside elk. They sowed
and then ate; they weaved and then were clothed. They never thought of doing
harm to others, which was the best virtue. Another text from Shangzi (tradition
ally attributed to Shang Yang, ca. 390–338 BC, but probably an essay collection
by Shang Yang and some of his followers) holds that during the time of Shen
nong, men cultivated for food, and women weaved for clothes. Without using
punishment and administration, the society was quite stable. Without using sol
diers and weapons, Shennong rose up as the king.
The Shennong myth is still popularly told throughout contemporary China.
Most Han Chinese know his name and his beneficial deeds of starting farming
and identifying medicine. Countless myths vividly describe the tough and some
times dangerous processes of his inventions. One myth collected in the 1980s in
Ba County, Chongqing City (which formerly belonged to Sichuan Province but
now is a municipality directly under the central government), says that in re
mote antiquity, a big flood brought immense destruction to this world. After
wards, plants and grasses grew overabundantly. Humans had no other food than
tree leaves and weeds. One day Emperor Shennong happened to find some grain
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
194



seeds adhered to a dog’s tail, thus protected from the flood, so he sowed them in
a field. Later on one lovely day, Shennong went out to enjoy the day with his
wife. When they came to the field where the seeds were planted, they found that
the seeds had grown into grain chaffs. Shennong asked his wife to squeeze a lit
tle milk from her breast into the empty shells. The chaffs then grew into grains.
Those chaffs that got more milk grew into plump grains, whereas those that got
less milk grew into wizened grains. After the milk dried in the shells, Shennong
took them as seeds and sowed them widely. Since the grain came into being
from the milk of Shennong’s wife, it is extremely nutritious for humans.
Modern myths are even more varied about the legendary and dangerous
process by which Shennong discovered medicine. A myth collected in the 1970s
in Zhejiang Province asserts that when humans first populated the earth, they
did not know how to cook. They always ate raw animals and plants, so they
often became sick. Shennong wanted to help them. He decided to taste every
thing he saw and identify what people could take as food and what they could
use as drugs to cure their diseases. So he carried two bags along with him. He
put those plants that could function as food into the left bag, and those plants
that could function as medicine into the right bag. Shennong was very uncom
mon because he had a crystal stomach and he could see clearly every thing and
every change in his internal organs. The first plant he tasted was a piece of green
leaf. After he ate it, he found that it cleaned everything up and down in his
stomach. Since it went up and down in his internal organs like it was going on a
tour of inspection, Shennong named it cha (literally meaning “inspection”). Peo
ple later incorrectly called it cha (meaning “tea”; the same phonetic sound, in
this case cha, but with a different character). Shennong put tea into his left bag.
Next he tasted a piece of licorice (Glycyrrhiza). He put it into his right bag. The
third plant he tasted was a small green flower. It was bitter and sour. When it
came into his stomach, Shennong found that it butted everywhere and his knees
became swollen. He hurried to consume some tea and was detoxified. Thus he
found another medicine, the Achyranthes root. In this way, Shennong tasted
hundreds of herbs and was poisoned almost every day, and the tea always helped
him to be detoxified. Day by day, the plants and herbs in his two bags greatly in
creased. There were 47,000 flowers, herbs, roots, or leaves in the left bag, and
398,000 in the right. One day Shennong tasted a yellow flower. As soon as he
swallowed it, he watched his intestine break into pieces. He died before he was
able to take some tea. Later this herb was popularly known as Duanchangcao,
the Intestine-breaking Weed. Because Shennong died for humans, he won great
respect in the world. He is commemorated and popularly worshiped as “the
Medicine King.” Today there are many temples for the Medicine King all over
the country.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 195



Besides those myths that describe the general process of Shennong tasting
herbs, some myth versions further describe how Shennong discovered a special
medicine. A myth collected in the 1980s in the Chengdu area of Sichuan
Province attributes the origin of ginger to Shennong. It says that in the ancient
past, ginger was extremely poisonous. If one touched it, one’s hand would decay;
if one smelled it, one’s nose would rot. All people therefore hated it. Whenever
they found it, they would dig it up and place it in the sun to die. Because of this,
ginger was almost extinct. It fled from here to there, trying to escape being dug
out of the ground. One day ginger fled to a garden. It found many plants flourish
ing, and an old farmer was irrigating the garden. Ginger admired those garden
plants very much, so it asked a white gourd who the old farmer was. The white
gourd said that it was Shennong, and it was he who dug them from the wild and
then planted them in the garden and took watchful care of them. They lived
there happily along with many of their family members. Ginger then com
plained to Shennong of his injustice for not collecting it as well. Shennong asked
ginger its function. When he learned that ginger could do nothing except poison
people, Shennong disliked it too. He wanted to step on ginger and exterminate
it. Ginger was smart. It quickly went into the ground. As it did this, it lost all of
its poison. After half a year, Shennong found a new seedling in the garden. He
tasted a piece of it. It tasted a little hot. He felt pleased that he had found a new
plant that could detoxify and produce heat, and could be used as both food and
medicine. From then on, ginger became a companion to humans, and it was able
to stay with many of its family members in the garden.
Some Shennong myths combine many of his mythical achievements and
mix them into a detailed and complex story. A long folk narrative poem spread
throughout Hubei Province in the Shennongjia area (jia means “ladder”; the
name Shennongjia came from a legend that Shennong set up a rattan ladder and
climbed onto a high mountain to gather herbs; later the rattan ladder turned into
a vast primitive forest, which was called Shennongjia), for instance, mixes many
different sources and includes long life histories of many gods, including Shen
nong. Popularly known by the name of Hei’anzhuan (“Story of the Chaos”) and
transmitted both in written transcriptions (several versions of its handwritten
copies have been found through today) and in oral tradition (it is usually sung
antiphonally by master singers in funeral rituals), this 3,000-line poem highly
rationalizes Shennong as a significant emperor in remote Chinese history. One
written version of it collected in the 1980s states that Emperor Shennong is also
named Yan Di. He was the son of Shaodian and Andeng. Since he grew up on Lie
Mountain, he was also called Lieshanshi. He taught people to cultivate land and
rear silkworms. During his time, people suffered greatly from plagues. To cure
the plagues, Shennong went into mountains and forests to look for medicines.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
196



He tasted hundreds of herbs. He met seventy-two poisonous plants, and he neu
tralized these poisons himself by consuming seventy-two other plants and
herbs. So he gathered these helpful herbs to cure people’s diseases. However,
there were thirty-six or thirty-seven poisonous plants that fled into deep forests.
That is why today poisonous plants are more likely to be found in mountains
and forests while good herbs are found in the plains. After he cured the plagues,
he went on to seek the five grains.
Shennong climbed onto Mount Yangtou,
He looked carefully, he examined carefully,
Then he found a seed of millet.
He left it with the Chinese date tree,
And he went to open up a wasteland.
He planted the seed eight times,
Then it produced fruit.
And from then on humans were able to eat millet.
He sought for the rice seed on Mount Daliang,
The seed was hiding in grasses.
He left it with the willow tree,
And he went to open up a paddy field.
He planted the seed seven times,
Then it produced fruit.
And from then on humans were able to eat rice.
He sought for the adzuki bean seed,
And left it with a plum tree.
He planted it one time.
The adzuki bean was easy to plant and was able to grow in infertile fields.
The soybean was produced on Mount Weishi,
So it was difficult for Shennong to get its seeds.
He left one seed of it with a peach tree,
He planted it five times,
Then it produced fruit,
And later tofu was able to be made south of the Huai River.
Barley and wheat were produced on Mount Zhushi,
Shennong was pleased that he got two seeds of them.
He left them with a peach tree,
And he planted them twelve times,
Then later people were able to eat pastry food.
He sought the sesame seed on Mount Wuzhi,
He left the seed with brambles.

Shennong planted the five grains and they all survived,
Because they were helped by the six species of trees.
Shennong taught people to trade,
Then people received convenience by the way of barter.
Shennong cut wood and made the plough to till,
And that started agriculture. . . .
Shennong established his capital at Chenzhou,
Which was Chouzhou City in Henan Province.
He was on the throne for 140 years,
And he died at Chalin County, Changsha City in Hunan Province.
In this poem, almost all important stories about Shennong are compounded
and combined into an integrated full story. Here Shennong is not only identified
with Yan Di, the son of Shaodian and Andeng (or, alternatively, Nüdeng), but the
last paragraph about him suggests that he is also confused with another famous
god, Fuxi, who founded the capital of his mythical kingdom in ancient Chen
zhou, now the Huaiyang County in Henan Province.
Shennong is a very important god in Chinese beliefs. He is popularly wor
shiped as the God of Agriculture or the Ancestor of Farming, and the God of
Medicine or the Ancestor of Medicine. In ancient China, emperors of the cen
tral government would offer sacrifices to Shennong at the beginning of every
spring. The ritual aimed to show the importance of agriculture in the national
economy and, furthermore, to urge farmers to cultivate more seriously and dili
gently. Shennong is also respected as the divine originator of many professions
and trades, such as farming, medicine, grain trade, pastry making, salt trade,
and even storytelling (he is said to have composed stories and songs to amuse
melancholic persons, at the same time using his herbs to cure their illnesses).
There are numerous temples, mausoleums, and relics for him scattered
throughout China. Many local festivals are held each year to commemorate
him, sometimes by the name of “Yan Di Shennongshi.” Several towns and
cities contend with each other to be his hometown. Shennongjia in Hubei
Province, mentioned earlier, is famous for the legend that Shennong tasted
herbs there; the idea that his rattan ladder for climbing up the mountain trans
formed into a deep forest is also well-known. In the same province, Lishan
Town in Suizhou City boasts itself as the birthplace of Yan Di Shennongshi.
There are several commemorative relics in honor of him there, such as Shen
nong Temple, Shennong Cave, and Shennong’s Nine Wells (which are said to
have appeared suddenly when Shennong was born). In Gaoping County, Shanxi
Province, one can find a Yan Di mausoleum and a Five Grains temple, and even
a Shennong town. According to a local legend, Yan Di Shennongshi tasted herbs

on Mount Yangtou in the town. On every lunar April 8, a big festival is held to
commemorate Yan Di Shennong. In Taiwan, there are 130 temples that mainly
worship Yan Di Shennong (Zhong 1994, 134). There Shennong is variously
called King Yan, God of Five Grains, Shennong the Great Emperor, the Ancestor
of Farming, the Great Emperor of Medicine, God of Earth, and God of the Field.
He is also worshiped as the patron god of farmers, rice traders, doctors of Chi
nese medicine, and others. Since it is popularly said that Shennong was born on
lunar April 26, festivals are usually held on this day in his temples to celebrate
his birthday. On April 25, 1992, for example, in Xianse Temple (Xianse means
“the Ancestor of Farming”), Sanchong City, Taibei County, people carried Shen
nong’s statue on a truck and traveled around the whole city. Others laid sacri
fices outside their gates, burned incense, and set off firecrackers when the
statue on the truck passed by. The next day, the mayor of the city presided over
the formal ritual of offering sacrifices (in accordance with tradition, a pig and a
sheep) to Shennong. Cows and oxen are not offered as a sacrifice because they
plough land and help with farming, so farmers should not slaughter them as
sacrifice.

SHENTU
Shentu always appears with Yulü in myths and beliefs; both are the original
Gate Gods.
The earliest record about Shentu and Yulü can be found in an early text
from Shanhaijing, which cannot be found in today’s edition of Shanhaijing, and
was cited by Lunheng. It describes Shentu and Yulü’s power and how they be
come Gate Gods. Among the great seas, there was Dushuo Mountain. On the
top of that mountain, a huge peach tree grew. Its branches reached 3,000 li
(about 1,000 miles). To the northeast of its branches there was the gate of ghosts
where all ghosts went in and out. Two deities, Shentu and Yulü, stayed above
the gate. They had the responsibility of supervising all of the ghosts. Evil or
harmful ghosts would be bound with reed rope and fed to tigers. Being inspired
by that, the great mythological emperor Huang Di started and promoted a ritual
that was held regularly. He taught people to paint the figures of Shentu, Yulü,
and a tiger on door frames, place a statue made from peach wood beside the gate,
and hang a reed rope on its top. By doing this at a specific time, all evils might be
driven away from people inside the house. From then on the belief in the Gate

Gods (Shentu and Yulü) spread. Similar descriptions can also be seen in Fengsu
Tongyi (Popular Customs and Traditions, second century CE) and several other
documents compiled in and after the Han dynasty. Many of these documents
also mention that the time for doing this custom is the end of each year. These
records suggest that at least in the Han dynasty, belief in the Gate Gods and the
custom of painting Shentu and Yulü’s pictures on door frames before the Chi
nese New Year had become very popular.
In later times this custom was simplified. People only painted the two
deities’ pictures on paper and pasted them on door frames before the Chinese
New Year. The pictures would not be replaced until the next New Year. Today,
in rural areas and in some urban settings, this custom is still common. How
ever, its function has become diverse. Rather than serving to guard the house
and protect the family, Gate Gods pictures are used to express happiness and cel
ebration, to decorate, or to entertain.
After the Tang dynasty, several other mythical or legendary figures were
also identified as Gate Gods. Besides the version about Shentu and Yulü, another
extremely popular version is that the roles of Gate Gods were assumed by Qin
Qiong and Yuchi Gong, two fierce generals in the Tang dynasty. Nowadays ver
sions about deities who assume the role of Gate Gods are numerous. However,
Shentu and Yulü continue to appear as the early Gate Gods in Chinese New
Year pictures in many areas.

SHUJUN
Shujun is a descendent of Di Jun (Emperor Jun); he is also the God of Cultivation
and a skillful craftsman who invented many vital cultural items for humans.
In different versions, Shujun’s name may appear as Yijun or Shangjun. He
was said to be the offspring of Di Jun, the grandson (or nephew in another ver
sion) of Houji. It was he who replaced his father and Houji to sow all sorts of
grains, and he invented the technique of plowing with a cow. As one of the min
isters of Huang Di, he suggested that the divine emperor should relocate Ba, the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 201



drought deity, to the north of the Red River, and hence keep central China safe
from frequent drought disasters. He was thus worshiped by people as the God of
Cultivation. There is also a recording that identifies Shujun as Qiaorui, a fa
mous craftsman who invented many varieties of crafts, such as the boat, bell,
and a plowlike farm tool, for people on earth.

SHUN
A demigod, Shun is the second of the three sage kings and the successor of Yao.
He is also known as Yu Shun (Yu here is different from another demigod and
sage king, Yu) and is sometimes identified as one of the Five August Emperors in
the mythical history of China; he is the emperor who abdicated and gave the
throne to Yu.
In early texts, stories about Shun and his two wives, Ehuang and Nüying,
are recorded often. Both Ehuang and Nüying were King Yao’s daughters. They
were promised to Shun by King Yao. In accounts from various texts, the mar
riages were depicted as a result of Yao valuing Shun’s virtues and abilities. In ad
dition, through this marriage of his daughters, Yao wanted to further test Shun’s
ability in dealing with family affairs, which was thought of as a basic and vital
ability for a person to have to govern a country. Shun proved his exceeding com
petence in managing family affairs. His two wives were virtuous, and their fam
ily got along very well.
As types of mythical figures, Ehuang and Nüying also showed their intelli
gence and divine abilities in helping Shun to overcome many difficulties and to
administer the country. One of the most renowned examples is that they helped
Shun to survive several murders plotted by his father and stepbrother before he
succeeded to gain the crown from Yao. Shun’s father, a blind man, remarried a
pretty woman after Shun’s mother died. He soon had a second son, Xiang, who
grew to be a very arrogant man. The father only loved his second wife and child.
Because he and his second wife wanted to misappropriate Shun’s family posses
sions, and because Xiang coveted Shun’s two wives, he often conspired with
Xiang to kill Shun, especially after Shun married King Yao’s two daughters. One
day the father asked Shun to repair the roof of a barn. Before going out, Shun told
this to his two wives. The wives said, “They are going to kill you. Please take off
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
202



your clothes and put on the coat
with the bird pattern before you go.”
When Shun climbed up to the roof
of the barn, his father took away the
ladder and set the barn on fire. But
Shun flew out of the fire with his
magic coat. Days later, the father
asked Shun to dredge a well. Shun’s
wives told Shun to wear a coat with
a dragon pattern. As soon as Shun
went down into the well, Xiang and
his father blocked the mouth of the
well. However, Shun swam out of
the well with his magic dragon-pat
terned coat. Xiang and his father
also tried to kill Shun by inviting
him to drink. They planned to kill
Shun after he was drunk. Again, the
trap was seen through by Shun’s
wives. They let Shun go after giving
him a bath in water with dissolved
magic medicine. Because of the
magical medicine Shun did not get
drunk throughout the whole day of
drinking.
The topic of Shun surviving his
parents’ and stepbrother’s murder
attempts is familiar in stories orally transmitted in many places, including
Sichuan, Henan, Anhui, and Shanxi provinces. There are a lot of versions of this
story. In each, the trick Shun’s father and stepbrother plotted tends to be differ
ent from that described in others. Most of them do not mention Ehuang’s and
Nüying’s help for Shun in pulling through every trap his father and stepbrother
made. For example, a story collected in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, mentions
several traps Shun’s parents and Xiang made in order to kill Shun. At first they
planned to kill Shun as he was asked to dredge the well. But Shun was rescued
out of the well by the God of the Earth. Then they wanted to burn him as he was
asked to repair the barn roof. But Shun was saved from the fire by the God of
Fire. At last, they invited Shun to dinner and let him sit on a specifically pre
pared chair. The chair was put on a piece of bamboo mat that covered the mouth
of a well. They assumed that Shun would drop down into the well and die as

soon as he sat on that chair. However, when Shun sat on the chair, it was very
steady. Xiang felt so curious that he lifted a corner of the mat and looked into
the well stealthily. Under the mat he found that a dragon was supporting the
mat with its head. This scared Xiang, and afterwards he and the parents never
dared to do harm to Shun again.
Before being found by Yao, Shun was a farmer cultivating in the Li Moun
tains. He was so virtuous and filial, even to his parents and stepbrother who
treated him badly, that many people recommended him to King Yao. Through
further examination of Shun both in virtue and in ability to rule the country,
King Yao recognized that Shun was worthy of receiving the throne. Thus Shun
was given the crown by Yao. When he went back home as a king, he treated his
father as respectfully and cautiously as before. As for his stepbrother Xiang, he
conferred on him the title of duke.
It was said that after Shun took power, his wives contributed numerous
ideas for keeping the country in perfect order. This was one of the main reasons
why Shun became a great king.
In an account from Shanhaijing (chapter 12), another of Shun’s wives is
mentioned. This wife was named Dengbi. She gave birth to two daughters,
Xiaoming (“Night Brilliant”) and Zhuguang (“Torch Light”). They lived in a
large marsh beside the river. Their divine aura was able to illumine a hundred
square li. These two girls’ mythical powers are taken as a reflection of Shun’s di
vine identity.
There is a sad and moving story that describes King Shun and his wives’
faithful love, which can be commonly found in both early records and orally
transmitted versions. King Shun died when he made an inspection trip to the
south. Receiving news of Shun’s death, Ehuang and Nüying were plunged into
deep sorrow. They cried and tore out their hair day after day, and their tears spat
tered onto the bamboo trees, which speckled those trees. From then on a kind of
spotted bamboo tree appeared. They were called Xiangfei’s Bamboo. Xiangfei lit
erally means “Xiang Madams.” According to another account, when Shun’s two
wives hastened to the place where Shun died, they both died from overwhelm
ing sadness and weariness beside the Xiang River. Seeing this, the God of
Heaven was touched, and he decreed that Shun should be the god of Xiang and
his two wives the madams of the river.
In a text told by people in Sichuan Province in southeastern China, Shun is
hailed as the hero who shot down nine of the ten suns rising together in the sky.
As the ten suns, who were the sons of the God of Heaven, often came out to
gether in the sky, plants and grass were burned. This was hard for the people,
who suffered from the heat and drought. When the God of Heaven became aware
of this, he ordered the god Shun to administer those suns. Shun shot down nine

204



of those suns and therefore saved people on the earth. The God of Heaven was so
distressed and angry that he drove out Shun from heaven. Shun thus descended
to the earth. Because of his great merits, King Yao chose him as his successor.
The most popular version of the myth of shooting suns in China is that which
identifies the hero who shot the suns as Yi. In some accounts from early texts,
there is also a version that depicts King Yao as the hero. But the related story of
Shun is seldom found. This version is probably the result of confusing Yao and
Shun, who had a lot of similar merits and a very close relationship.

SKY LADDER
The mythical sky ladder connects heaven and the earth. The ladder enables gods
and humans to travel between heaven and earth.
The motif of the sky ladder exists in many ethnic groups in China, such as
the Han, Buyi, Miao, Yao, Qiang, Naxi, Dulong, and Kazak. The sky ladder can
assume the form of a high mountain or mythical tree, and it is sometimes de
picted as a rainbow, sky rope, sky tower, or cobweb. Some myth versions explain
why humans or sorcerers climbed the sky ladder up to heaven, and why the sky
ladders were finally destroyed and therefore humans lost their ability to ascend
to heaven. A myth collected in Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, states that
in remote antiquity, there was a high mountain that reached the sky. With it,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 205



men on the earth could climb up to the sky, and deities in heaven could descend
to the earth. A young man climbed to heaven by going up the mountain and
married one of the God of Heaven’s daughters. The God of Heaven was very
upset. When his daughter descended to the earth with her husband, he gave her
many gifts, such as grain, pigs, and chickens, and these were the first of such
things in the world. But he also cut the high mountain into two halves. From
then on, humans on earth could no longer climb to heaven. The young couple
became the ancestors of the Qiang people.
In another myth collected from the Yao people in Liannan County, Guang
dong Province, the sky ladder was a tree. It holds that at the very beginning, the
sky was very close to the earth. People on the earth could easily get to heaven by
climbing the tree. One day, a handsome young man went up to heaven by the
tree and fell in love with the Water Goddess. Since the goddess was so devoted
to this new love and thus neglected her duty, a flood destroyed the human race
on earth. With the help of the goddess’s parents, the young couple re-created hu
mans by spreading the seeds of grain and sesame on the earth. The seeds all
changed into men and women. To avoid any further trouble made by humans,
the supreme god (the Jade Emperor in this story) lifted up the sky. Thereafter,
humans could not go up to heaven.
In myths recorded in ancient Chinese writings, sky ladders commonly ap
pear as high mountains and huge trees. The most distinguished sky ladder is
Kunlun Mountain, one of the most remarkable mythical mountains in Chinese
mythology. Kunlun is said to be the earthly residence of the Supreme Divinity,
and the paradise of deities and immortals, one of the pillars of the sky that keeps
heaven from collapsing, and a sky ladder that linked the earth to heaven. A text
from Huainanzi (chapter 4) clearly shows the nature of Kunlun as the sky ladder
and even describes the process of climbing it to heaven. It maintains that the
first tier of Kunlun Mountain was Liangfeng (“Cool Wind Mountain”). Anyone
who climbed it would receive immortality. The second tier was called Xuanpu.
Anyone who climbed this tier would acquire spiritual power and could control
the wind and rain. And if one climbed further, one would arrive at heaven, the
residence of the Supreme Divinity, and thereafter one would become a spirit. In
addition to Kunlun Mountain, many other high mountains serve as sky ladders.
According to a text in Shanhaijing, the treasure of ancient Chinese myths, there
was Zhao Mountain to the east of Mount Hua and Green Water. An immortal
named Bo Gao often went up to heaven and back down by this mountain (chap
ter 18). In another text (chapter 7), Dengbao Mountain acted as a sky ladder by
which many sorcerers traveled. According to yet another text in Shanhaijing
(chapter 16), Ling Mountain was the sky ladder with which ten sorcerers went
up and down the sky. Abundant medicinal herbs grew there.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
206



In some other versions, the sky ladder is a huge tree. The most noted tree
sky ladder in ancient writings is Jianmu (literally meaning “Building Tree”). Ac
cording to an account in Huainanzi (chapter 4), Jianmu grew in the field of
Duguang. With it, the gods went up and down between heaven and earth. At
midday it had no shadow; shouting to it, there was no echo. Some suggest that
perhaps it was the center of the world. In another text in Shanhaijing (chapter
18), Jianmu was an enormous tree with a height of 800 feet. It had no branches
in the middle, only twigs curled on the top and roots twisted and gnarled. Its
fruit was like the seeds of hemp, and its leaves were like those of the Mang tree.
Two sentences in this text are quite vague in meaning. According to Yuan Ke’s
analysis, they state that Taihao once went up to heaven through Jianmu, and it
was made by Huang Di (Yuan 1993, 510–513).
Another well-known ancient myth relating to the sky ladder states that the
Supreme Divinity had the connection between the sky and the earth cut off.
Though it does not clearly mention “sky ladder,” it actually tells a story about
why and how the sky ladder was destroyed. A text from Shangshu states that
Chiyou started a revolt and brought disaster to the common people. Influenced
by him, people on the earth gradually were corrupted. They began to cheat and
steal. However, the Miao people did not obey him at first. Chiyou thus desig
nated five brutal punishments to deal with them. Then, little by little, the Miao
people also became corrupt. They began to cheat each other within their own
group, mistreat people from other groups, disobey their faith, and violate the
oath between them and the Supreme Divinity. Many innocent people brought
complaints against them to the Supreme Divinity. The Supreme Divinity thus
ordered two of his subordinates, the deities Zhong and Li, to cut off the link be
tween heaven and the earth. From then on, the Miao people could never ascend
to heaven again, but at the same time, the deities could no longer descend to the
earth.
In the oral traditions of many ethnic peoples, such as the Han, Miao, Qiang,
Buyi, and Tujia, the tree of the sky ladder is commonly said to be Coriaria Sinica
maxim. A myth told by Yang Lihui’s mother (sixty-five years old at this writing,
and of Han heritage; she heard this story about fifty years before in her hometown
in Shehong County, Sichuan Province) in October 2004 explains why the Coriaria
Sinica maxim tree today becomes so low and curved. In the remote past, the tree
was so high that it reached heaven. One year, twelve suns showed up together in
the sky. The world became so hot that the earth almost burned. At this time, a
hero on the earth climbed to the sky using the tree and smashed the surplus suns
with a stick, leaving only one to serve humankind. Though the world order was
restored to normal again, the God of Heaven worried that humans would ascend
to the sky in the future and intervene with heavenly affairs again, so he cursed,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 207



The Coriaria Sinica maxim tree,
Will no longer grow so high any more.
It will bend down at its waist,
Before it reaches the height of three feet.
Since that time, the tree has grown low and curved, and, as a result, the human
race can never again use it to ascend to heaven.
Some researchers argue that the sky ladder myth depicts a dichotomous
world: humans on the earth and gods in heaven; the people who create and
spread the sky ladder myth and a distant other land. The process of climbing the
sky ladder is, in fact, a process of changing from man to god, from profane to sa
cred (Zhuang 2004).

SUIRENSHI
Suirenshi is a famous Chinese culture hero who invented the technique of mak
ing fire by drilling on wood.
The discovery of fire is a widespread motif in worldwide mythology. In
China, myths related to this motif can be found not only among Han people but
also among many other ethnic groups. The stories might vary among different
people; however, most of them center on a hero who first discovered the use of
fire and invented the method of making fire. For example, a myth told by
Zhuang people in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southwest China
mentions that it was the great god Buluotuo who invented the method of mak
ing fire. In the ancient past, people ate only raw foods because they did not have
the ability to make and use fire. One day Buluotuo saw a large tree that had been
burned when it was struck by lightning. Through his observation of this natural
phenomenon he discovered that he could cook food by using fire, and he taught
this technique to others. People kept the fire going and used it to cook their
food, until one day they lost it when it rained. Buluotuo hacked at the tree with
his divine ax and got a spark, thus inventing a method for making fire.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
208



In a story spread among the
Buyi people in Guizhou Province in
southwest China, the name of the
hero is Leling. He discovered and
taught people the method of making
fire by striking together two pieces
of stone.
In comparison with these two
stories, a myth told by Hani people
in southwest China is much more
solemn and stirring. It tells of a
hero, Azha, who dedicated his life to
getting fire. The only source of fire
at that time was in a lamp between
the eyebrows of a monster. The
young hero suffered through many
hurdles and eventually got the fire
by stealing it. However, as he was
leaving to return home, the monster
found him. In a fight with the mon
ster he swallowed the fire. Azha
killed the monster and returned to
his hometown, and afterward he cut
open his chest and took out the fire.
Hani people hence received warmth
and brightness, but Azha died from
his struggle and his sacrifice.
The most famous fire discovery
myth spread among Han people is
the story of Suirenshi. According to a
text from chapter 869 in Taiping Yulan (An Imperial Reading of Texts Compiled
in the Taiping Era [977–984 CE], compiled by Li Fang, 925–996 CE), Suirenshi was a
sage in ancient times. He traveled to very far places in order to find a way to
change people’s habit of eating raw foods. Once he traveled to the country of
Suiming. In this country there was no distinction among the four seasons and be
tween day and night. People never died here. If somebody did grow tired of living
in this world, he or she would ascend to the heavens. In this place there was a
huge igneous tree named the Sui tree. Its branches spanned an area of thousands of
miles, and its trunk was surrounded by clouds. If one took a branch from this tree
and drilled on it, there would be fire. When the sage passed by the tree, he noticed
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 209
The Fire Driller (Suirenshi) brought fire to humans in Chinese myth. (The Dragon, Image, and Demon, 1886)



a bird like an owl pecking at the tree. Sparks appeared as it was pecking. Enlight
ened by the bird, the sage learned the method of making fire by drilling on a small
branch of the tree. He taught this to humans when he returned, and was thus
called Suirenshi. Literally sui means “the tool of fire making,” ren means “human
being” or “the person,” and shi here is a respectful form of address for gods.
The recordings found in several other early texts have the same plot as the
story of Suirenshi inventing a method for making fire by drilling on wood. How
ever, in some versions orally transmitted among Han people today, the method
of making fire has been changed to striking stones. The following example was
collected in Shangqiu County, Henan Province: In ancient times when Suirenshi
was the emperor, people still ate only raw foods. One day there was a fire in the
forest that killed a lot of animals. When the fire ended, Suirenshi found many
animals’ bodies burned. He picked up a piece of the cooked flesh from one ani
mal’s body and tasted it. It was much more delicious than when eaten raw. He
then directed other people to pick apart and eat the cooked animal flesh. Every
one enjoyed the tasty meat very much. However, the cooked meat was soon
gone. Everyone expected another fire to provide cooked food again.
One day a huge bird flew to Suirenshi. It told him that it would like to carry
Suirenshi to the sun to get fire. When Suirenshi arrived at the sun palace by rid
ing the bird, he told the princess in the palace his desire. The princess bestowed
on him a piece of flint. Then Suirenshi flew back to the earth on the bird’s back.
Because the princess did not tell him how to use the flint, Suirenshi became
angry after waiting a long time for the fire to come out of the flint sponta
neously. He threw away the flint in anger, and it struck a stone. Sparks appeared.
Upon seeing this, Suirenshi got the idea of making fire by striking stones to
gether. He taught this technique to others. From then on, people no longer suf
fered from eating only raw foods. And Suirenshi was thus worshiped as a great
hero by people in later times.

TAIHAO
One of the five gods of the directions, the god of the east and the spring season,
Taihao is often confused with Fuxi in later tradition. He is also known as Dahao.
In his name, tai or da literally means “great” or “supreme,” and hao means “ex
pansive and limitless.”
In an account from Shanhaijing (chapter 18), Taihao is associated with
Jianmu, a known sky ladder. As it is described in the text, Jianmu was an enor
mous tree standing 800 feet in height. Its leaves were green, its trunk was pur
ple, its flowers dark, and its fruit yellow. At the end of this text Taihao is men
tioned, though the meaning is vague. The text states that “Taihao once passed
by this tree.” But today some scholars interpret it to mean that Taihao once
went to and from heaven through Jianmu (Yuan 1993, 510–513).
In early texts, Taihao is identified as one of the five gods distributed to rule
the five directions (east, south, west, north, and center) and the five elements
(wood, fire, metal, water, and earth, which are elements encompassing the
whole world in traditional Chinese philosophy). In different texts the names of
these five gods may vary. According to a version from Huainanzi (chapter 3),
Taihao was the god of the east, associated with the element wood. In this ac
count, Taihao is also described as the god controlling the season of spring to
gether with his subordinate Goumang.
During the Han dynasty, Taihao was gradually identified as another great
god, Fuxi, who appeared as an independent divinity in pre-Han sources. From
then on, “Taihao Fuxishi” became a unique combination that frequently ap
peared either in written texts or in verbal art. In many accounts they each in
herit the merits and powers of the other and merge into one certain god. Fuxi
not only received the honorary name of Taihao but also took Taihao’s function
as the god who reigned over the east and controlled the season of spring. The
wood god, Goumang, became Fuxi’s subordinate too. In Huaiyang County,
Henan Province, for example, there is a big temple complex called the Tomb of
Taihao, or, more popularly, Renzu Temple (Temple of Human Ancestors).
Huaiyang is said to be the capital of King Taihao Fuxi’s mythical kingdom and
the hometown of Fuxi. The main god worshiped here is Taihao Fuxishi. From
February 2 to March 3 according to the lunar calendar, there is a monthlong
temple fair to celebrate Taihao Fuxi’s birthday at the Renzu Temple complex.
The fair draws thousands of pilgrims daily from nearby villages, counties, and
provinces.

TANG VALLEY
The place where the ten suns stay, rise, and bathe, the Tang Valley is also called
Yang Valley in different versions.
Tang Valley is a mythical place closely related to Chinese people’s beliefs
about the ten suns in ancient times. People believed that each of the ten suns
would be on duty one at a time in the sky, and Tang Valley is the place where
they replaced each other and rose in turn. The detailed description of this imagi
native explanation may be found in several parts of Shanhaijing. According to a
text in chapter 14, the Tang Valley was located in the eastern great wilderness,
in which there was a big tree named Fusang (“Leaning Mulberry”). All the ten
suns rose from here in turn. Each of them was carried by a crow. As soon as one
sun came back from its journey crossing the sky, another one started forth.
In chapter 10 of Shanhaijing, Tang Valley is described as a place where the
ten suns stayed and bathed. In the water of the valley there was a large tree. On
the lower branches nine of the ten suns stayed, and on the top branch was the
sun that would rise next.
In an account from Huainanzi, Tang Valley is identified with Yang Valley.
This is explained by most Chinese scholars as occurring because “Tang” and
“Yang” have a similar pronunciation and shape in Chinese characters.

TWELVE MOONS
The mythic motif of “formerly several moons” spread in many ethnic groups in
China, such as the Han, Yi, Miao, Buyi, and Lisu. It states that there were sev
eral moons in remote antiquity. The number of the moons varies from five,
seven, nine, or twelve to even sixty-six among different peoples. In most cases
the motif is combined with a story explaining how the surplus moons were ru
ined and thus only one moon was left in the sky. Sometimes the story also con
tains the motifs of multiple suns and destroying the surplus suns.
A creation epic of the Yi people in Guizhou Province chants that during the
time of creation, the sun father and the moon mother married and then gave
birth to ninety-nine suns and sixty-six moons. The suns rose up together in the
day, and the moons showed up together during the night. The world became so
hot that all of the trees died and the rain was exhausted. A god then shot down
all the surplus suns and moons, leaving only the youngest sun and moon. But,
because they became so sad, they did not rise at all. So another god fixed them in
the sky. This was the beginning of the four seasons.
A myth collected from the Lisu people in Yunnan Province describes that
after the brother and sister ancestors
came out from a gourd that pro
tected them from drowning in the
world flood, they found that nine
suns and seven moons had risen to
gether in the sky. By using a gold
bow and silver arrows they received
from the dragon king, they shot
down the surplus suns and moons.
Then they married each other and
procreated the ancestors of the Ti
betan, Bai, Keqin, Han, Nu, and Lisu
peoples.
In myths in the Chinese lan
guage, the renowned story about the
multiple moons is that of Changxi
and her twelve moon children.
Changxi is said to be one of Di Jun’s
wives. According to a text in Shan
haijing, Changxi gave birth to
twelve moons and was just begin
ning to bathe them at this time

(chapter 16). However, it is quite unclear in this text how the twelve moons
worked during the night, and why they were bathed by their mother.

XIANGLIU
A minister of Gonggong, Xiangliu (or Xiangyou) is a monster with nine human
heads and a snake’s body. He was killed by the hero Yu.
The early detailed text of the Xiangliu myth can be found in Shanhaijing
(chapter 8). It tells the story of Xiangliu’s figure and powers, and gives an account
of his death. Xiangliu was a minister of Gonggong, the water god who died after
failing in a battle against Zhuanxu
to be the Supreme Divinity. He had
nine heads, each with a human face,
and a snake’s body that was black.
With his nine heads Xiangliu ate
foods from nine mountains. The
places he passed by became marshes
and gullies in which no animals
could survive. Afterwards he was
killed by Yu, one of the three sage
kings (commonly known as Yao,
Shun, and Yu). Xiangliu’s blood
stank of rot, and it poisoned the
earth, making it impossible to plant
grains at the place where he died. Yu
wanted to remove the blood. He dug
out the soil three times, but each
time the blood soaked deeper into
the earth. Yu then built a terrace
from the excavated soil for all great
gods, which was located in the area

to the north of Kunlun Mountain and to the east of Rouli. A similar account can
be found in chapter 17 of Shanhaijing; in that text Xiangliu appears as Xiangyou.
Xiangliu’s stories are not often told nowadays in China. However, in some
areas there are still orally transmitted versions of the Xiangliu myth. One exam
ple is a text collected in 1983 from Wan County in Sichuan Province (now part
of Chongqing Municipality), located in southwestern China. It tells the story
that Xiangliu continued to cause floods and other kinds of harm after he was de
feated by Zhurong, so he was killed by the goddess Nüwa. In this story Xiangliu
is depicted as a nine-headed poisonous dragon. He not only caused flooding in
the Sichuan area but also devoured humans and livestock. Being aware of this,
Nüwa fought Xiangliu and finally killed him. The flooding in Sichuan was con
sequently controlled.

XIHE
Xihe is the mother of the ten suns and one of Di Jun’s wives.
The motif of “creation of the sun” is found in many ethnic groups in China.
The sun is sometimes depicted as having been created by gods, sometimes it is
transformed from a divine corpse, and sometimes it is born from its parents. For
example, a myth in the Buyi ethnic group holds that the god Wengga gave birth
to the sky, the earth, day and night, and the sun and the moon. In the Luoba eth
nic group in Tibet, the parents of the sun are the sky and the earth.
In myths in the Chinese language, the sun is commonly said to have been
born by its mother Xihe and father Di Jun. However, similar to the myth of
Changxi, who is the mother of the twelve moons and another wife of Di Jun, the
Xihe myth is quite sparse in Chinese mythology texts in spite of Xihe’s high sta
tus. Her accomplishment can mainly be found in Shanhaijing. A text from that
book (chapter 15) states that beyond the east sea in the Gan River area was the
Xihe kingdom. A lady named Xihe, wife of Di Jun, gave birth to ten suns. She
was bathing the ten suns in the Gan Gulf.
Another text from the same book further describes how the ten suns work.
The ten suns lived on the Fusang tree, which grew in the water of the Tang Valley.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 215



The ten suns stayed in the Fusang tree
and bathed in the water there. Nine of
the suns stayed on the tree’s lower
branches while the one that was going to
rise stayed on its top branch. The ten
suns rose from the Fusang tree one by
one. As soon as one sun returned from
crossing the sky, another sun went up.
Each sun was carried by a crow (chapter
14). In another version in that book,
Xihe is portrayed as the driver who
steered a cart pulled by six dragons and
sent her children out into the sky.
As in the Changxi myth about her
bathing the twelve moons, the reason
Xihe bathed the suns is unclear in these
texts. Some myths spread in the Miao,
Buyi, and Yi ethnic groups explain that
the sun and the moon need to be
washed in order to cleanse them from
the dust they accumulate during their
work to make them bright again. These versions may provide some help in un
derstanding the myths about bathing the suns and the moons told among Han
people.
Xihe is variously said to be the official who takes charge of the seasons and
calendar. Xihe’s gender seems vague in this case.

XINGTIAN
Xingtian is a notable deity who continues to fight against the supreme god even
after he is beheaded. In some early texts he is also said to have served as a minis
ter of Yan Di.
According to Shanhaijing (chapter 7), Xingtian fought with the supreme god
to become the Supreme Divinity, and he lost the battle. The god cut off Xing
tian’s head and buried it on Changyang Mountain. However, Xingtian perse
vered. After he lost his head, he used his nipples as his eyes and his navel as his
mouth and continued to brandish his shield and battle-ax. By doing this, he ex
pressed his fierce spirit that would never submit or give up.
The solemn and stirring spirit reflected in this story has attracted and en
couraged Chinese people for a long time. The hero Xingtian has become a sym
bol for Chinese people to express their will to resist whatever pressures and dif

ficulties they face. Many writers in different eras have composed poetry and
prose to express praise and admiration for Xingtian. One of the more famous ex
amples is a poem written by Tao Yuanming (365–427 CE), a well-known poet in
the Jin dynasty. This poem states that “Xingtian brandished his shield and bat
tle-ax, his fierce spirit will live forever.”
In an account from Lushi, a book of history compiled by Luo Mi, a scholar
in the Southern Song dynasty, another of Xingtian’s great deeds is mentioned.
He was one of the ministers of Yan Di. In accordance with Yan Di’s command,
Xingtian composed music to complement the work of plowing and the harvest.
The Chinese character of xing in this “Xingtian” is different from that in Shan
haijing. However, many scholars argue that they are the same figure.

XIWANGMU
One of the most popular goddesses in Chinese mythology and folk belief, Xi
wangmu was originally a wild beastlike goddess (or god) who became the ruler of
punishment, calamity, and disease, but later changed into a refined queen. She
was the owner of the elixir of immortality and the divine peaches that can
endow longevity on one who eats them. She also was the leader of the goddesses
in the Taoist pantheon. At least as late as during the Ming dynasty she was com
monly referred to as Wangmu Niangniang (wangmu literally means “queen
mother,” and niangniang is a respectful title for a goddess).
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
218



The Xiwangmu myth appears early in the book Shanhaijing, which depicts
Xiwangmu as a wild and fearsome spirit whose gender is quite unclear. Many
Chinese scholars maintain that Xiwangmu’s image in Shanhaijing illustrates
that she possessed both female and male features. One account (chapter 2) de
scribes Xiwangmu as a deity of disaster, disease, and punishment. She dwelled
on the Jade Mountain, which is very close to Kunlun Mountain, the earthly res
idence of the Supreme Divinity and a paradise for deities and immortals. She
looked like a human but had a panther’s tail and tiger’s teeth. She was good at
roaring, and wore a jade sheng on her head. Many Chinese scholars interpret
sheng to be a hair ornament, but some argue that wearing a sheng meant “cut
ting off the animal’s hide and wearing it” (Wang 1996, 303). Sheng can also be in
terpreted as a special part of a loom, which illustrates Xiwangmu’s original con
nection with sericulture (Kominami 1993, 54).
In another text from Shanhaijing (chapter 12), Xiwangmu leans against a
small table, wearing a jade sheng on her head. To the south of her, three green
birds were fetching food for her (in some versions, a single bird—a three-legged
crow—fetched her food). They were all situated north of Kunlun Mountain. An
other text of the same book (chapter 16) states that Kunlun Mountain was lo
cated south of the west sea, on the shore of the Liusha, behind the Red River and
in front of the Black River. The Weak River (whose water was so weak that it
could not float even a feather) circled the bottom of the mountain, and a flaming
mountain surrounded it. A spirit dwelled in the mountain. It was a human
headed creature with a tiger’s body and white spotted tail. Xiwangmu inhabited a
cave there. She wore a sheng and had tiger’s teeth and a panther’s tail.
From the Warring States era to the Han dynasty, Xiwangmu’s image
changed greatly from a wild and ferocious monsterlike deity to a cultivated
queen. In a book named Mutianzizhuan (A Biography of Emperor Mu, tradition
ally said to have been written in the Western Zhou dynasty or the Warring
States period), Xiwangmu became a polite princess when hosting Emperor Mu of
Zhou at a banquet. She not only improvised poems to communicate with Em
peror Mu but also sang elegantly, though, according to her own poems, she still
lived with wild animals and birds. Additionally in this period, her functions in
creased rapidly. She was believed to control various aspects of human life such
as wealth, health, fertility, and calamity, and was described as even more power
ful and pervasive than the description of her in Shanhaijing. She became popu
larly known as the keeper of the elixir of immortality, which has the magic
power of keeping one’s vitality and preventing death. A well-known myth about
the elixir is the story of Yi and Chang’e. In the early Han book Huainanzi, the
hero Yi is said to have asked for the elixir of immortality from Xiwangmu, and
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 219



she gave it to him. But his wife Chang’e stole
it, then flew to the moon and became the
spirit of the moon.
In the Han dynasty, Xiwangmu is popu
larly depicted to have a consort named Dong
wanggong, King Father of the East. There are
quite a few stories about him in ancient docu
ments. According to a text in Shenyijing (The
Classic of Spirits and Strange Things, once
said to have been written by a Han writer,
Dongfang Shuo, 154–93 BC, but seemingly
compiled later by an anonymous author),
there was a bronze pillar on Kunlun Moun
tain. It was so big and high that it reached the
sky. In fact, it was a pillar of the sky. On top
of it there was a huge bird named Xiyou (liter
ally meaning “rare”). Opening its left wing, it
covered Dongwanggong; opening the right
one, it covered Xiwangmu. When Xiwangmu
met Dongwanggong, she had to climb onto its
wing. In another account, Dongwanggong
lived in a big stone house on the East Wild
Mountain. He was about ten feet high, and his
hair was as white as snow. He looked like a
man but had a bird’s face and a tiger’s tail. He
rode a black bear. With a Jade Maiden he often
played the game of throwing chips into a pot.

When he threw chips into the pot, heaven sighed; when he failed, heaven
laughed.
In inscriptions on bronze mirrors from this era, Xiwangmu’s and Dongwang
gong’s names frequently appear together. In most cases, they are described as
long-lived immortals who controlled the secret of immortality. Yet people also
prayed to them for wealth, safety, honor, and children. On funerary stones and
brick bas-reliefs found in Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hunan,
Zhejiang, Sichuan, and many other provinces, Xiwangmu is sometimes shown
alone, and sometimes she is accompanied by Dongwanggong. She is typically
shown as a respectable goddess, sitting on a cloud or a seat made of a dragon and
a tiger. She is often surrounded by Jade Rabbit, a toad, birds, or sometimes a
three-legged crow, a deer, a dragon, a nine-tailed fox, and immortal servants with
wings. The rabbit (sometimes the immortal servants also) usually is pounding
the elixir in a mortar in front of Xiwangmu and Dongwanggong.
During the Wei and Jin dynasties, with the flourishing of Taoism, Xi
wangmu was further immortalized and became a leader of the female immor
tals. She also is widely known as the owner of the divine saucer peach, a fruit
that has the magic power of endowing longevity. In a book written in this pe
riod, Hanwudi Neizhuan, or The Biography of Emperor Wu of Han, Xiwangmu
is depicted as a beautiful and graceful female immortal dressed up in Taoist
style. Thousands of immortals accompanied her, and even her two serving maid
ens were extremely beautiful. She gave four saucer peaches to the emperor (who
reigned from 156 to 87 BC). Since the peaches tasted so good, the emperor kept
the pits, hoping to plant them when he came back to the central land. But Xi
wangmu told him that this kind of peach needed to be harvested for 3,000 years
before yielding ripe peaches. The emperor felt disappointed and gave up. In some
other Taoist books in this period, Xiwangmu is given a more honorable origin
and became the daughter of the highest god in Taoism, Yuanshi Tianzun.
After the Tang and Song dynasties, Xiwangmu becomes more common in
folk tradition. She often appears in a later-formed pantheon (far from orderly and
stable) as the consort of Yu Di, the Jade Emperor, the highest ruler of heaven and
gods. One of their daughters is the famous Weaving Maiden. In legends she is said
to secretly descend to the world and marry a cowboy. Her mother felt quite an
noyed so she pulled out her hairpin and made a line in the air. The line then
turned into the Milky Way that divided the lovers on the two sides of the shore.
From then on, on every lunar July 7, the lovers were allowed to meet each other.
Magpies would fly over to make the bridge for them. In the renowned mythic
novel Xiyouji (Journey to the West, written by Wu Cheng’en, ca. 1500–1582),
which found many of its sources in folk tradition, Xiwangmu is addressed as
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 221



Wangmu Niangniang, the bearer of peaches that gave immortality to whoever ate
them. She often invited other immortals and gods to the Saucer Peach Banquet.
The peaches she used for the banquet were classified into three sorts: the first
one ripened every 3,000 years and could make the person who ate it healthy; the
second one ripened every 6,000 years and could bring the one who ate it a long
life; the third one ripened every 9,000 years and could make the one who ate it as
long-lived as heaven and the earth. In the novel, the Monkey King ate many of
the best peaches and disturbed the banquet because he was not invited.
Today, the wild and ferocious Xiwangmu can hardly be found in Chinese
mythology. Compared to Nüwa, Fuxi, Pangu, and many other ancient gods and
goddesses in mythology, modern myths about Wangmu Niangniang are not rich
in detail. Wangmu Niangniang usually appears in the stories as a minor charac
ter, a divine predictor, an adviser, a helper, an intervener, and so on. Perhaps this
is because her original mythological behaviors are slim and pale in comparison
to the deeds of others.
A myth collected in the 1980s in Gao County, Yibin District, Sichuan
Province, portrays Wangmu Niangniang as the consort of Yu Di and the mother
of the sun and the moon. It states that the sun and the moon were siblings.
Their parents were Yu Di and Wangmu. In the beginning, the sun and the moon
worked together, one shining in the east and west while the other shined in the
south and north. Later, because of the sun’s sexual harassment of his sister the
moon, she confronted him in front of Yu Di. Their father was so angry that he
decided to kill his son. At this time Wangmu arrived. She cried and suggested
that Yu Di not do so. Finally, Yu Di accepted a minor god’s idea and separated
the siblings. From then on, the sun worked in the daytime, and the moon came
out only during the nighttime.
Occasionally Wangmu Niangniang plays a crucial role in a myth. A myth
collected in 1986 in a village of Zhongning County, Ningxia Province, north
west China, attributes the contribution of repairing the broken sky and the
earth to Wangmu Niangniang and Lishan Laomu (who sometimes is identified
as Nüwa). It holds that Wangmu Niangniang was Lishan Laomu’s younger sis
ter. Both of them were good helpers of their elder brother Fuxi. One year, Gong
gong fought Zhurong and destroyed the sky pillar Mount Buzhou. The sky then
tilted toward the northwest, the earth was damaged at the southeast, and flood
water overflowed everywhere. The two sisters felt sympathetic to humans and
decided to repair the damaged sky and earth. They gathered and melted stones
of five different colors to patch the sky at the site of Mount Li (now in Shaanxi
Province). The firelight they made was absorbed by the sun. Thus it could illu
minate the world with sunlight. The fire also melted ice on the earth, so it be

came a hot spring. The sisters cooperated to accomplish the huge project.
Wangmu Niangniang took care of the fire while Lishan Laomu kneaded the
stone paste and made numerous stone cakes. She then stuck them in the bro
ken sky. To prevent the stone cakes from falling down from the sky, Lishan
Laomu cut the legs off a huge tortoise and set them up to support the four ex
tremities of the sky. Wangmu Niangniang then used the ashes to fill in the
flaws on the earth. After their arduous labor, the world was restored again. After
they died, people built a temple at Mount Li to commemorate their tremendous
accomplishment.
Xiwangmu or Wangmu Niangniang has long played an important role in folk
beliefs. In 3 BC, for example, under the disordered social circumstances of the end
of the Western Han, numerous people became involved in a movement of wor
shiping Xiwangmu. They sang and danced to amuse the goddess. Believing that
the goddess would come to the world soon and that only those persons having
Xiwangmu’s special chips would be able to live, swarms of frightened people
traveled around the country and passed the chips (a piece of straw or dried hemp)
to others. The movement lasted several months and spread to twenty-six prefec
tures and shocked the capital. Wang Zijin, a modern Chinese historian, argues
that the movement illustrates the Han people’s strong folk belief in Xiwangmu’s
power of controlling longevity and also the deep fear of her western origin (Wang
1999, 114–122). In contemporary China, Wangmu Niangniang is much more
popular than Nüwa, Fuxi, and Pangu in popular religion. Temples to her can be
found almost all over the area populated by Han people. In Jingchuan County,
Gansu Province, there is a Wangmu palace. The building’s history can be traced
to 1,000 years ago, though the current structure was partially rebuilt in 1992.
Now the gods worshiped in the temple complex include Wangmu Niangniang,
Dongwanggong, the Three Divine Sovereigns, the Five August Emperors, and
even Emperor Mu of Zhou and Emperor Wu of Han. On every lunar March 3 and
July 18, residents from local towns join those from faraway cities such as
Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Xianyang, Xi’an—and even Taiwan—at the palace to wor
ship Wangmu Niangniang, Dongwanggong, and other gods (according to a field
report based on two fieldwork studies in 1999 and 2001, many common pilgrims
do not know the name “Xiwangmu”). They pray to receive rain during drought,
to rid their farms of locusts, to find a wife, to get a child (especially a son), to re
cover from an illness, and to receive a long life, as well as for luck in entering
college, being wealthy, finding a job, regaining what has been lost, and so forth.
Many pilgrims believe that Wangmu Niangniang is very powerful and mighty.
She can protect her pilgrims’ land from locusts when other land next to it is full
of locusts (Zhao 2002, 97–108). On the Tai Mountain in Shandong Province can
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 223



be found a temple complex named Wangmu Pool. Most of it was built during the
Qing dynasty. Every lunar March 3, a Saucer Peach Festival is held to celebrate
Wangmu Niangniang’s birthday. Pilgrims often try to throw coins into the basins
in the center of the pool, believing that they will get the goddess’s blessing if
they get them in. Some of them like to bring spring water back home, believing
the divine water can keep them healthy. According to a report based on two
fieldwork studies done in 2000 and 2001, the sacrifices pilgrims offer to the god
dess include wine, cigarettes, imitation RMB (renminbi, Chinese currency)
usually with a “10 billion” face value—and even imitation U.S. dollars (Zhao
2002, 109–119).

YAN DI
God of the south, summer, and fire, Yan Di is one of the Five August Emperors
(names differ in different texts) who ruled over the five directions and five ele
ments; he is the half brother of Huang Di. He engaged in an extensive war
against Huang Di and lost. In later tradition Yan Di was often confused with
Shennong, the Divine Farmer. Afterward he was further respected jointly with
Huang Di as the common ancestor of all Chinese people. Literally yan means
“flame,” and di means “emperor.”
According to an account from Shiji, Yan Di was the son of Shaodian. He was
born after his mother, Nüdeng, was touched by a divine dragon and became
pregnant. Shaodian was also said to be the father of Huang Di, the Yellow Em
peror. In this explanation, Yan Di and Huang Di were brothers. This relationship
is demonstrated in another account from Xinshu (New Documents, written by a
Han dynasty writer, Jia Yi, 201–168 BC). It states that Yan Di was Huang Di’s half
brother. The same text describes the war between Yan Di and Huang Di. At the
beginning of their time, each of the two brothers controlled half of the world.
Huang Di ruled his kingdom based on benevolence and morality, but Yan Di did
not follow these principles. This finally caused a war between them at the open
plain of Zhuolu (which now belongs to modern Hebei Province). The battle was
fierce and brutal. It ended in the failure of Yan Di. Huang Di then executed Yan
Di and took over his land. The world therefore became peaceful.
The war between Yan Di and his brother is one of the most noteworthy
deeds that Yan Di did; it is also one of the most well-known stories in Chinese
mythology. Versions of this myth can easily be found in both written texts and
oral traditions. However, as for the end of Yan Di, the explanation is quite differ
ent in various accounts. Versions recorded in early texts such as the one cited
above from Xinshu state that Yan Di was killed by Huang Di. But in stories told
by people today, the event is the opposite. For example, a narrative collected in
the 1980s in Xinzheng County, Henan Province, says that after being defeated,
Yan Di accepted Huang Di’s good intentions and became an ally to him. They
became sworn brothers, and their clans were united into one large country. This
version is a good rationalization for the reason both Yan Di and Huang Di have
been identified as common ancestors of Chinese people for a long time.
In early texts, Yan Di is also known as one of the Five August Emperors, gods
that were distributed according to the five directions (east, south, west, north,
and center) and the five elements (wood, fire, metal, water, and earth). Their
names may be different in various stories. According to a popular account, Yan
Di was the god of the south and the element of fire. He and his subordinate
Zhuming managed the beams of steelyards and controlled the season of summer.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 225



As an exalted god, Yan Di had
many distinguished descendents
who are also famous figures in Chi
nese mythology. One example is his
daughter Nü Wa (literally nü means
“female,” and wa means “child”).
She drowned while playing in the
sea. But she was so unyielding to
death that she turned into Jingwei, a
mythical bird, and indomitably
tried to fill up the sea with pebbles.
Another of Yan Di’s daughters, Yao
Ji, is also well-known for her trans
formation after dying. She changed
into a mythical grass that could
make the person who ate it attract
other people, causing them to fall in
love with that person. Besides these
uncommon daughters, the two emi
nent deities Chiyou (the god of war)
and Zhurong (the god of the fire and
of the south in some myth ver
sions) are also said to be Yan Di’s
descendents.
In later tradition, Yan Di was confused with another great god, Shennong,
the Divine Farmer. He takes Shennong’s basic mythological functions as his
own. Therefore, in myths recorded or told by people in later times, Yan Di not
only appears as the God of the South and Summer, the half brother of Huang Di
who fought against Huang Di at Zhuolu, but also as the God of Agriculture and
Medicine, and is given the title “Yan Di Shennong Shi” (shi here is a respectful
form of address for gods.)

YAO
A demigod, Yao was the first of the three sage kings. He is famous for initiating
the system of abdicating and handing over the crown to a worthy person, and he
is the king who ordered the hero Yi to shoot down nine of the ten suns that ap
peared together in the sky (in some versions he is identified as the hero who shot
down those nine suns). He also is known as one of the Five August Emperors in
the mythical history of China.
Yao was said to be one of the sagest sovereigns in the remote antiquity of
Chinese history. In numerous Confucian writings, he is praised as an exemplary
model for emperors in later eras. His virtues include diligence, thrift, and loving
his people. He ruled his country by using his virtues and benevolence to influ
ence people instead of using penalties to punish them. Under his rule, society
went along in perfect order. Because of that, Confucians identified the era of Yao
and several following eras as a golden age in Chinese history. Yao was worshiped
together with his successor, Shun, and later Yu as the three sage kings.
Several texts record stories of Yao, Shun, and Yu. The most renowned is that
Yao abdicated and handed over his power to Shun. From then on a political sys
tem of abdication in favor of a worthy person was started.
In a text from Shiji, Yao is described as a son of Di Ku, a god and one of the
Five August Emperors in mythical history. As a benevolent and wise sovereign,
he had taught people the knowledge of sowing different crops according to differ
ent seasons, ordered Gun and his son Yu to stop the flood successively, and had
defeated Gonggong and put down all kinds of turbulence throughout the coun
try. With his administering, people were living in happiness and safety.
The most mythical stories of Yao recorded in early documents are those
about his birth and about shooting ten suns rising together in the sky. It was said
that Yao was born after his mother copulated with a red dragon. His mother,
named Qingdu, was the daughter of a great god. When she grew up, her body was
often surrounded by yellow clouds. She did not get married until she was twenty
years old. One day, as she was beside a river, with a sudden blast, a red dragon
flew to her and had sex with her. She then became pregnant and gave birth to
Yao after fourteen months.
The myth of shooting down the extra suns that come out together in the
sky is very well-known in China. The most common version of this story tells
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 227



that the hero Yi shot down nine
suns according to Yao’s order. But
there is also an account in early
texts that identifies Yao as the hero
who shot the ten suns, which is not
popular today. Some scholars be
lieve that in early times there were
two versions of the myth of shoot
ing ten suns, and both were popular
among the people. In later times be
cause the one telling of Yi became
dominant, the other one passed into
silence.
Some early records also de
scribe Yao as a culture hero who in
vented the famous Chinese game of
weiqi (or Go, a game played with
black and white pieces on a square
board of 361 intersections formed
by nineteen vertical lines and nine
teen horizontal lines). This is often
related to his eldest son, Danzhu,
who was described as a playboy who
did not inherit any of his father’s
merits. In order to exert a favorable
influence on him, Yao invented the
game of weiqi. He made the board
out of mulberry wood and the
pieces with rhinoceros and elephant
bones, and then taught the art of
weiqi to his son. Danzhu was smart
enough in learning the game. He
even became the best player. How
ever, Danzhu was finally banished to Danshui because he was still a vicious per
son. One version even mentions that he was executed by Yao.
The Yao myth is still told by people in many areas of China today. For ex
ample, a story orally transmitted in Henan Province tells of the conflict between
Yao and Danzhu. In this telling, Danzhu was the only son of King Yao. Differing
from his father, he was a very snippy and vicious person. He lived in extreme ex
travagance and often bullied and oppressed ordinary people. Seeing his son be so

cruel to people, Yao decided to hand over his throne to a virtuous person, Shun,
instead of Danzhu. Danzhu was so angry at hearing this that he decided to mur
der Yao before he gave the crown to Shun. One day he invited Yao to a new
palace where he had prepared a trap to murder his father. According to Danzhu’s
plan, as soon as Yao went into the palace, he would close and lock the gate, and
then have it plugged up with clay. Yao would definitely be killed inside. But Yao
was so wise that he saw through Danzhu’s trick. He ordered Danzhu to lead the
way into the palace. As soon as Danzhu stepped through the gate, Yao closed the
gate and locked it. Eventually Danzhu dug a grave for himself.
A story collected from Shanxi Province in northern China describes one of
Yao’s mythical helpers, a divine goat. When Yao was the king, in the Yangxie
area a goat with a single horn was born among a shepherd’s goats. This goat was
very wise in judging right or wrong. Whenever it saw two persons in a quarrel or
a fight, it would butt the one who was in the wrong. The shepherd was surprised
at this, so he reported this to Gaotao, one of Yao’s ministers. Gaotao then told it
to King Yao, and suggested the king see it himself. When they got to Yangxie and
saw the goat, Gaotao told Yao that the goat was divine and had appeared as an
auspicious sign to the wonderful societies ruled by great sage kings. According
to Gaotao, the goat had only appeared one time before, during Huang Di’s reign.
Yao was moved by the gift from the supreme god. He bought the divine goat, and
it served Yao’s court as a judge of people’s character (faithfulness or treachery,
and innocence or guilt).

YAO GRASS
Yao Grass is a mythical grass that transformed from the body of Yan Di’s daugh
ter Yao Ji after she died. It had special effects on people who ate it, causing them
to be charming and attractive to others.
According to Shanhaijing (chapter 5), Yan Di’s daughter died on Guyao
Mountain. Her body transformed into Yao Grass. Its leaves were very luxuriant,
its flowers were yellow, and its fruits looked like those of the dodder plant. It
had a specific magical power that could make the person who ate it attract other
people and cause people to fall in love with them.
The same chapter of Shanhaijing states that Yao Grass grew at Taishi
Mountain, appearing like the medicinal plant atractylodes with white flowers
and black fruit. Anyone who used it would never be confused. However, this
type of Yao Grass is different from that which Yan Di’s daughter transformed
into.

YI
Yi is Chang’e’s husband, a great divine archer and a famous culture hero who
shoots down nine surplus suns and also wipes out different kinds of monsters. In
later tradition, he is often confused with another archer, Houyi.
Among Yi’s various accomplishments, the most known is that he elimi
nates the nine surplus suns disturbing the cosmic order and returns it to normal.
Though he is the most popular hero related to this mythological achievement,
he finds many counterparts in myths of other ethnic groups in China.
The myth motif of “formerly several suns” is quite popular among the Han,
Hani, Lahu, Luoba, Lisu, Naxi, Qiang, Tujia, Miao, Yao, Dong, Yi, Zhuang, Li,
Buyi, Gelao, Mongol, Hezhe, and many other ethnic groups. It illustrates that
there was more than one sun appearing in the sky in remote antiquity. The
number of the suns may be two, three, seven, nine, ten, or twelve, according to
different versions. Usually, the motif appears with another one of “eliminating
the surplus suns,” and they serve as an etiological myth to explain why there is
only one sun today. It usually tells that in ancient ages, several suns appeared in
the sky. The weather became extremely hot, the earth was burned, and the crops
all died. Humans suffered greatly from the disaster. Then a hero showed up. He
shot down (sometimes biting down or knocking down with a bamboo pole in
different versions) the surplus suns and left only one for the normal use of this
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
230



world. In some cases, these motifs about suns show up symmetrically together
with the ones of “formerly several moons” and “eliminating the surplus
moons.”
In ancient written texts in the Chinese language, the number of the multi
ple suns is usually ten. In some texts of Shanhaijing, the goddess Xihe gave birth
to ten suns and bathed them in the Gan Gulf. The ten suns lived on the Fusang
tree. When one sun finished its work and came back home, another sun would
go out in its place. They were all carried by crows (chapters 14 and 15). Accord
ing to this picture, the ten suns worked in orderly fashion. However, in some
other versions, instead of taking duty one by one in order, the ten suns somehow
rose up together and thus brought great disaster to the world. The hero who
showed up at this time and cleared up the disaster is Yi. The early poem “Tian
wen” clearly mentions Yi’s story by asking: “Why did Yi shoot down the suns?
Why did the crows shed their feathers?” Wang Yi (ca. second century CE), the
commentator of “Tianwen,” cites a paragraph from Huainanzi to explain these
questions, stating that at the time of the sage king Yao, the ten suns rose to
gether and burned up the woods and grass. Yao then ordered the hero Yi to shoot
down the ten suns in the sky, and Yi shot down nine of them. The nine crows
settling on these suns died, and their feathers fell out.
In addition to shooting down the suns, Yi accomplishes other remarkable
deeds, such as wiping out various monsters doing harm to people. A text of
Huainanzi depicts that at the time of Yao, ten suns rose up together in the sky.
They burnt crops and killed the grasses and woods, so that humans could not
find food. Many ferocious monsters, such as Zhayu (a monster with a dragon’s
head and leopard’s body), Zaochi (whose teeth are as sharp as chisels), Jiuying (a
monster with nine heads), Dafeng (an enormous bird), Fengxi (a large wild boar),
and Xiushe (a huge snake), all took advantage of this time to devour humans.
Yao ordered Yi to eliminate the monsters, and Yi complied. People were so
pleased that they respected Yao as their king (“the Son of the Heaven”). After
ward the world became inhabitable and people began to communicate with each
other (chapter 8). In some other myths, Yi also punishes the damaging river god,
He Bo, and the wind god, Feng Bo. He Bo drowned men, so Yi shot him and
blinded his left eye. Feng Bo destroyed people’s houses, so Yi shot him in his
knees. In another version, Yi stopped Feng Bo from damaging houses by shooting
him at the Qinqiu Marsh. Yi is also variously said to have killed Feng Bo.
Another famous Yi myth relates to his wife Chang’e. According to a text in
Huainanzi (chapter 6), Yi asked for the elixir of immortality from Xiwangmu,
the Queen Mother of the West. He got it, but later Chang’e stole it from him and
consumed it. Then she flew to the moon. Yi was very disappointed but could not
recover the elixir. In some versions, Chang’e is said to transform into a toad after
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 231



she escapes to the moon. This is usually interpreted as a punishment for her be
havior of stealing the precious elixir and abandoning her husband.
Like many Chinese gods and spirits, Yi eventually died. A popular story at
tributes Yi’s death to his apprentice Fengmeng. Fengmeng learned the shooting
art from Yi and gradually became an expert. When he realized that Yi was the
only obstacle preventing him from being the best archer in the world, he killed
Yi by surprise. In some versions, he used a big peach tree branch to strike Yi
down. So, from then on, ghosts all fear peach trees, and for this reason the latter
are widely used in rituals. After his death, Yi was worshiped as Zongbu, a god
who takes charge of averting disasters.
In many versions, especially in many living myths today, Yi is often identi
fied as Houyi. Some scholars argue that because the Yi myth became divergent
during its long transmission, Yi is addressed as Houyi sometimes in later tradi
tion and Yi and Houyi are actually the same person (Hu 1994, 1–17). Others be
lieve that the two are originally two separate great archers but are confused in
later traditions (Yuan 1996, 267–272).
The Yi story continues to be popularly transmitted in contemporary China.
Compared to his various accomplishments in ancient written recordings, the
modern Yi myth usually shows more interest in his shooting down the suns and
his wife’s escaping to the moon. A myth collected in the 1980s in Ba County,
Chongqing Municipality, formerly Sichuan Province, states that when humans
just came to this world, there were ten suns in the sky. Sometimes they showed
up together, sometimes they appeared in turn. Because of this, there was no
night in this world, only day. The suns burnt the earth into cracks, and men died
of thirst and hunger. At that time, a man named Houyi appeared. He had great
strength, and he decided to shoot down the suns in the sky. His bow was made
of tiger’s bone, and his arrows were made of dragon’s tendons. Using his magic
bow and arrows, he shot down nine suns in one breath. The last sun was so
scared that it ran away and hid. The world was then cast into a long night. Hu
mans could not live in this environment either, so they asked Houyi not to
shoot the last remaining sun. Though Houyi did not shoot it, the last sun still
did not dare to appear. So people shouted to it: “Come out, please!” But the sun
did not reveal itself. The people in turn sent a magpie, a crow, and a night owl to
shout to the sun as an invitation, but the sun still did not rise. Finally, the cock
sincerely shouted to the sun: “Oh Brother, Brother [pronounced gege in Chi
nese], come out please!” The sun was touched, so it finally rose. From then on,
every morning, the cock shouts to the sun: “Gege, Gege.” Hearing its voice, the
sun gradually shows up and brings brightness to the world.
In another myth collected in the 1980s in Henan Province, the ten suns are
described as the grandsons of the God of Heaven. Every morning they came out
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
232



together to play, which caused serious calamity: the crops withered and rivers
dried up. To banish the disaster, Houyi shot down nine of them. When he was
going to shoot the last one, the sun disappeared. The world became so dark that
nothing could be seen. Then an earthworm told Houyi that the sun was hiding
on the earth, under a lush purslane. But Houyi could not find it because of the
darkness. Later, since humans could not live without the sun, they invited the
sun to rise again. When the sun rose up to the sky, to pay a debt of gratitude to
the purslane for protecting it from being discovered by Houyi, the sun would
never bask the purslane to death. But as soon as the earthworm showed itself, it
would be basked to death.
Another group of Yi myths orally transmitted in contemporary China con
nects Houyi with Chang’e. A version that attributes the origin of the Mid-Autumn
Festival to their love story goes like this: In the remote past, there was a hero
named Yi who was excellent at shooting. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky to
gether and brought great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of them and was
given the elixir of immortality as a reward. Yi did not want to be immortal with
out his wife Chang’e with him, so he did not consume it. One day, on the fifteenth
of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went out hunting, his apprentice, Feng
meng, broke into Yi’s house and forced Chang’e to give the elixir to him. Chang’e
refused to do so. To protect it from being stolen, she swallowed it and flew into the
sky. Since she loved her husband very much and hoped to live nearby, she chose
the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened,
he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang’e liked in the yard and
gave sacrifices to his wife. People were sympathetic to Chang’e, so they partici
pated in these sacrifices with Yi. From then on, on every August 15 in the lunar
calendar, people eat moon cakes and round fruits to commemorate Chang’e.

YINGLONG
A divine winged dragon who helped Huang Di to overcome Chiyou in a battle,
Yinglong is also identified as the god of rain in some texts. Yinglong literally
means “Responding Dragon.”
Several texts about Yinglong are scattered in different sections of Shanhai
jing. According to Jin dynasty scholar Guo Pu (276–324 CE), who wrote a com
mentary on Shanhaijing, Yinglong was a type of dragon who had wings. As a
story in Shanhaijing (chapter 17) illustrates, Yinglong made a great contribution
to Huang Di in winning the battle against Chiyou. When Chiyou started a war
to challenge Huang Di, Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack
against Chiyou in the wilderness of the central plain. Yinglong began by storing
all of the water in order to flood and submerge his rivals. Chiyou responded with
the same tactic. He asked the gods Feng Bo and Yu Shi to release a gale and a
cloudburst in aid of his attacks. Huang Di then asked the drought goddess Ba to
descend down from the heavens and cause a drought. With her help, the rain was
stopped. In this way, through the use of a drought, Huang Di killed Chiyou.
In another version of the myth found in the same chapter of Shanhaijing,
the person who killed Chiyou is said to be Yinglong, and it is written that later
Yinglong also killed Kuafu. Afterwards he moved to the south to settle down.
Because of his arrival in the south and inhabitance there, the south was abun
dant with rain.
In a text from chapter 14 of Shanhaijing, Yinglong is described as a god who
had the power of controlling the rain. He dwelled in the remote south after he
killed Chiyou and Kuafu. Since he could not ascend to the heavens, there was no

longer a deity to release the rain, and drought occurred frequently on the earth.
Whenever and wherever a drought appeared, if the people there made a statue of
Yinglong with clay and held a ritual, it would rain. This myth has shaped a com
plicated praying-for-rain ritual that was practiced in later times.

YOUCHAOSHI
A celebrated culture hero, Youchaoshi was the inventor of the house (or “nest”)
in which people could live. Literally, you means “have,” chao means “nest,”
and shi here is a respectful form of address. Thus, Youchaoshi literally means
“the person who invented the nest.” He is also known as Youchao or Da Chao
(da means “great”).
Records about Youchaoshi in early texts are not very detailed. According to
several similar accounts scattered in different classical documents, Youchaoshi
was a sage who invented the nest for people to live in. In the remote past, the
world was home to many beasts and birds, many more than there were human
beings. People suffered from the animals’ disturbances. Then a wise man in
vented a wooden nest for people to dwell in. People were happy to be safe from
harm by different animals, so they chose the wise man as their king. The man
was called Youchaoshi.
A myth collected in the 1980s in Ba County, Chongqing Municipality,
southwest China, gives a detailed description of the story about Youchaoshi’s in
vention of the house. In ancient times, people had neither clothes to wear nor
houses to live in. When it snowed, many people died from frostbite. A man
named Youchaoshi worried about this. He was determined to figure out an idea
to help people get away from the harmful cold. One day when he napped on the
branch of a tree, he dreamed that he flew up to heaven. With a god’s indication,
he located the god of construction. He asked the god how people could keep
from dying in the winter. Though Youchaoshi repeatedly asked for the god’s
help, the god refused to contribute any ideas, with the excuse that he did not
care about the affairs of the earth. At last the god pushed Youchaoshi down on
his hands, and he dropped down to the earth. As Youchaoshi awoke from this
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 235



dream, he thought of the buildings in heaven and wished they could be made on
the earth. He was so frustrated that he pawed at a huge tree. Immediately a fur
row appeared in the trunk of the tree that was large enough to accommodate
four or five people. Youchaoshi recognized that the god of construction had
transmitted a divine power to him in pushing him down on his hands. He then
set about fashioning many furrows in trees for people to live. Afterwards, the
human population grew larger and larger, whereas large trees became fewer and
fewer. Remembering that the buildings he had seen in heaven were made of
wood, Youchaoshi tried to construct one by putting small trees onto the
branches of large trees. With his efforts, he eventually invented the first house
in the shape of a nest.

YOUDU
Youdu is the capital of the other world that is located below the surface of the
earth. It is also the name of a place where the sun sets.
You in Chinese means “dark,” and du means “capital.” According to Chi
nese people’s beliefs, when human beings die, their souls will go to the under
ground world that is reigned over by the god Houtu. Youdu is the capital of this
world. Because it is a very dark place, it is named Youdu, the Dark Capital.
Another version about Youdu describes it as the place where the sun sets.
When the sun reaches Youdu it sets, and therefore the whole world is in darkness.

YU
Yu is a demigod miraculously born from the belly of Gun’s corpse, a hero fa
mous for controlling the world flood, and the successor of Shun. He is the third
of the three sage kings; the founder of the first civilized state, Xia; and is some

times identified as a descendent of Zhuanxu and Huang Di. His name often ap
pears as Da Yu in verbal art (da literally means “great”).
According to a renowned account recorded in many early texts, Yu was born
from the belly of his father’s corpse. Yu’s father, Gun, was executed by Zhurong
(names vary in different versions) for stealing Xirang, the self-growing soil, from
the Supreme Divinity in order to stop the flood, though Gun failed in his mission.
However, for three years after Gun died, his
corpse was not tampered with. When his
belly was opened with a sword, Yu emerged
out of it.
None of the early records mention how
and by whom the belly of Gun’s corpse was
opened. A reasonable explanation for this
vagueness might be found in a detailed de
scription from a story orally transmitted in
the Huai River valley. It states that after
Gun was executed, his spirit was so un
yielding that he conceived a new life in his
belly. Learning this news, the Supreme Di
vinity sent one of his subordinates to in
spect it. The subordinate found that Gun’s
corpse had vitality as if he was still alive.
He hacked at Gun’s belly with a precious
sword the Supreme Divinity granted him.
Then the baby Yu was born, riding a dragon
from the opened belly.
The greatest deed that Yu performed
was that he stopped the world flood. A ver
sion tells that Yu was commanded by the
Supreme Divinity to spread Xirang to con
trol the floodwaters and stabilize the world.
In another popular version, Yu was recom
mended to King Yao by Shun to fight against
the flood. However it is recounted, being
born of Gun’s indomitable spirit, Yu contin
ued his father’s unfinished work as he grew.
It is said that in dealing with this diffi
cult task, Yu suffered and struggled for thir
teen years. He devoted himself thoroughly to
the mission of stopping the flood, so that he

After retiring, he invented the method of cultivating the quietness in one’s soul.” (Feng Yunpeng and Feng Yunyuan, Research on Stone Carving, 1821)



did not visit his home even once during this long term. According to a famous
story, even when he had three opportunities to pass by his home, he did not go
into his house. This virtue of selflessness and strong-mindedness won him great
respect from people in later times.
As a wise and astute hero, he sought assistance from different mythical
helpers and performed many miracles in battling the flood. Differing from the
method of only barricading against the overflowing water with soil his father
had used, Yu mainly applied a strategy to channel the floodwater into the sea to
gether with building barricades. Evidence for this can be found in an account in
“Tianwen.” It states in a questioning style, “The whirlpool was so deep, how
could Yu fill it in with mud? How did Yinglong (Responding Dragon) drag on the
earth with his tail so that the flood was channeled into the sea?” A similar de
piction may be found in another text from Shiyiji (Researches into Lost Records,
ca. fourth century). It mentions that when Yu was on his mission of stopping the
flood, Yinglong dragged its tail to channel the water in front of him, while a
huge black turtle carrying green mud followed him.
Many stories mention Yu getting help from different gods. One of the popu
lar versions is that he was given a detailed map for controlling flood by He Bo,
the god of the Yellow River (he literally means “river,” and bo means “master”
or “god”). It was said that He Bo used to be a human being named Fengyi (some
times Pingyi or Bingyi; names differ in some versions). He was drowned while
ferrying the Yellow River. The Supreme Divinity had compassion for him, so
that he appointed Fengyi to be the god of the river. When Yu started his mission
of flood control with an investigation of the situation at the Yellow River, a god
with a white human face and a fish trunk emerged from the water. He told Yu
that he was He Bo, and he gave a map of the locations of rivers to Yu. Then he
dove into the river again. With this map, Yu got the big picture concerning the
situation of world flooding and made reasonable methods to deal with it, which
helped him greatly in stopping the flood.
In order to control the flood, Yu defeated and controlled many different
monsters that brought disasters to men. One example is that he executed Xiang
liu, a nine-headed monster that, wherever it passed, turned land into marshes
and gullies in which no animals could survive. Another example is that he con
trolled Wuzhiqi, the monster in the Huai River. When Yu traveled to Tongbai
Mountain on his mission of flood control, several times he encountered gales
and thunder made by the monster Wuzhiqi and its mythical followers, which
prevented him from starting his work here. Yu became angry. He assembled all
the gods and ordered Kui to clear all of the evils. Gods from Tongbai and other
mountains who used to follow Wuzhiqi were scared, so they yielded to Yu. Yu
put some of them into jail and hence enticed Wuzhiqi, spirit of the Huai River,

to appear. It appeared as a monkey with a green trunk, white head, yellow eyes,
and white paws. Its neck reached nearly 100 feet when stretched, and its
strength was as powerful as that of nine elephants. The monster was good at
talking, very smart and quick to act. After failing several times in choosing a
person among his subordinate gods to control the monster, Yu finally found that
Gengchen was the right choice, capable of controlling Wuzhiqi. Gengchen drove
away all kinds of demons that came to disturb his work. He tied Wuzhiqi’s neck
with a thick and sturdy chain, pierced its nose with a golden bell, and kept it at
the foot of Gui Mountain. From then on the Huai River was under control.
Because he could not only defeat and execute demons or gods who dis
obeyed his orders but also govern all the gods, Yu was identified by some schol
ars as the Supreme Divinity. This assumption might be supported by the stories
about his banishing Gonggong, the water god, and killing Fangfeng, a god and
giant who arrived late to his assembly of gods.
Except for his mythical power, Yu is also praised in various texts for his ex
traordinary braveness. For example, an account recorded in different early texts
depicts that Yu, as a human being, once overcame a dragon. One time in his
travels to inspect the south, when Yu was ferried across the Yangzi River, a yel
low dragon suddenly appeared on the boat. All the passengers in the boat were
terrified except for Yu. Yu said to the dragon with a laugh, “On behalf of the
heavens, I’m doing my best to save all the people. For me, I am just temporarily
staying in the world, and will be going back home to die. How could you scare
me?” During his talk, he looked at the dragon as if he was facing a small worm.
The dragon thus fled.
Among the Yu myths, stories about Yu and his wife, a lady from Tushan, are
very rich in detail. It is said that Yu did not marry until he was thirty years old,
when he passed by Tushan on his travels to control the flood. According to an
account from early texts, Yu was afraid that he would transgress the moral rite
of passage that required a man to marry by the age of thirty; he therefore prayed
for an omen to signify his marriage. Immediately after this, a white fox with
nine tails appeared to him. Yu explained this as an omen that he would marry a
girl from the Tushan clan. He thus made his marriage with Tushanshi, the girl
from Tushan (shi here is an address for a married woman).
Some versions tell that on the fifth day after he got married, Yu left his wife
and continued his work of controlling the flood. Nevertheless, a lot of stories
mention that Yu was working with his wife’s help. The most well-known is that
about Yu changing into a bear. When Yu was starting to excavate through a
mountain in order to channel the flood to the sea, he told Tushanshi, “Please
send me food whenever you hear the drum.” Then he went to the mountain and
changed into a bear to cut off the mountains and rocks. While working, he
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 239



stepped on the drum by error. Hearing the drum, Tushanshi brought food to her
husband. Yu was unaware of his wife’s presence, and he continued to work as a
bear. Tushanshi was ashamed of seeing that her husband had changed into a
beast, so she fled. At the foot of the mountain, she began to change into a stone.
This happened right at the time when she was going to give birth to a baby.
When Yu finally found his wife, she had already become a rock. He asked the
transformation of his wife to give him back the baby. The rock then split at the
side facing the north. From the opening Yu’s son, Qi, was born (qi literally
means “open”). Qi later inherited his father’s throne and became the first em
peror of Xia, the first civilized state in China.
By working hard for thirteen years, Yu eventually stopped the flood. As a re
sult, the world became dry, and people became settled again. Because of his great
contribution to the world and because of his virtues, Yu was chosen by King
Shun as the successor to his crown.
In addition to controlling the flood, Yu accomplished many other impressive
deeds that were influential in Chinese mythology and history. The most famous
one is that he had the earth measured. According to an account from Shanhaijing
(chapter 9), Yu ordered his subordinate Shuhai to measure the earth from the ex
treme area of the east to that of the west. He then got the information about the
distance between these two extremes. It was 500,109,800 bu (bu literally means
“pace”; according to one version, one bu is about eight feet). In different texts,
the details about Yu having the earth measured vary. For instance, in a text from
chapter 4 of Huainanzi, Yu is said to have both the distance between the east and
the west and that between the two poles measured, and the figure is different
from that noted in Shanhaijing. However, this work is believed to have greatly
helped Yu in controlling the flood and ruling the country.
Another of Yu’s mythical deeds is that he cast the Nine Cauldrons after suc
ceeding to Shun’s throne. Those cauldrons had the divine function to teach peo
ple to distinguish between faithfulness and treachery, and to keep evils and
demons from harming people, so they were treated as national treasures. In later
tradition, though these cauldrons were scattered and disappeared, they were
identified as the symbol of the supreme imperial power. It was believed that
whoever wanted to be the emperor should possess the Nine Cauldrons.
As a hero who devoted himself to saving people, who made a great contribu
tion to the world, and who showed great spirit in making every effort to com
plete a task no matter how arduous, Yu has been respected not only as a paragon
of sovereigns in later times but also as an exemplary model to encourage people
to actively handle difficult situations and to strive for a better life. Besides being
a major mythological figure, Yu also has had widespread influence in Chinese
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
240



culture and society. For example, in Taoism, the most popular traditional reli
gion in China, there is a renowned ritual dance named the Yu Pace. It is believed
to be a powerful magic dance. In important rituals Taoists will perform it while
imitating being lame. This dance is said to originate from Yu. One version asso
ciates this with Yu’s work of controlling the flood. Because he had been keeping
at this work for so long, he got rheumatism in one leg and became lame. To
commemorate him, people in later times created the ritual dance by imitating
his walk, and named it after Yu. Another version says this dance was created by
Yu himself by imitating a divine bird’s act. When he assembled all the gods, he
often danced with this pace.
Furthermore, in many places all over the country, such as Shandong,
Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces, one can find many
temples to King Yu built in different times. In Hequ County, Shanxi Province,
for instance, there is a King Yu temple, built in the Qing dynasty. Every July 15
according to the lunar calendar, people will hold a grand ritual to worship Yu. In
the evening, there will be a lantern festival. In Shaoxing City, Zhejiang
Province, there is the Tomb of Yu, where Yu is said to be buried (the legendary
location of Yu’s tomb varies from one version to the next). Beside the tomb, an
old King Yu temple has been rebuilt and redecorated many times. Originally this
temple was built in the Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589 CE), but it
was demolished in later times. Repeatedly, the temple was reconstructed after
being destroyed. The temple in existence today was reconstructed in 1934; it is
still maintained and kept in good condition. Both the tomb and the temple
served as the place where sovereigns in different dynasties offered sacrifices to
King Yu. According to early records, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty came
here to worship King Yu. This started a rite for emperors in later times to wor
ship King Yu at the Tomb of Yu in Shaoxing. At present, this place is still attrac
tive to Chinese leaders and a lot of ordinary people.
Another place famous for temples of Yu is Beichuan County in Sichuan
Province. This is one of the places where Yu is said to have been born. In this
county, from the Tang dynasty (618–907) through the present, several temples
and memorials for Yu were built. The most impressive one is the Da Yu Memor
ial. It is an ancient-style building built in 1991 with the support of the local gov
ernment. Inside, pictures about Da Yu’s legendary remains, rubbings of related
inscriptions, books and articles studying Yu, and various artworks are presented.
As the first memorial to Da Yu in China, it can be taken as a typical symbol for
Chinese people nowadays to express their highest respect to the great Yu.

YU SHI
The rain god Yu Shi was one of the great aides of Chiyou in the battle against
Huang Di. In his name yu means “rain” and shi means “master.”
Yu Shi usually appears in Chinese myth and popular religions together with
the wind god Feng Bo. The most famous story about him is from Shanhaijing
(chapter 17). This text tells how Yu Shi and Feng Bo helped Chiyou in his fight
against Huang Di. When Huang Di’s subordinate Yinglong attacked Chiyou by
storing all water, Chiyou asked Feng Bo and Yu Shi to release a storm. Huang Di
sent a request to the drought goddess Ba to descend from heaven and stop the
storm. Because of the subsequent drought caused by Ba, Chiyou lost the battle.
However, Yu Shi and Feng Bo are remembered and written about for the impres
sive powers they showed in the war, and the text in Shanhaijing recounts these
divine powers.
Another account about Yu Shi appears in Hanfeizi. It depicts Yu Shi, Feng
Bo, and even Chiyou as subordinate gods of Huang Di. When Huang Di assem
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
242



bled the deities and ghosts on Mount Tai, he was surrounded by many retinues.
Elephants and dragons pulled the cart for him, the divine bird Bifang accompa
nied him, Chiyou led the way, Feng Bo cleaned the road, Yu Shi created sprin
kles of rain along the way, tigers and wolves ran ahead, and deities and ghosts
followed him. The descriptions in this text are quite contrary to those in the
above text from Shanhaijing that presents these gods as enemies of Huang Di.
Chinese scholars have been trying to find an explanation for this paradox; how
ever, no convincing conclusions have been made.
Among the Han people and some ethnic groups such as the Maonan people
in southwest China, Yu Shi is still active (as is Feng Bo) in popular religion
today. In rituals held to pray for rain, Yu Shi is often worshiped as one of the im
portant gods of rain. However, the Yu Shi in this context holds a higher divine
position than the deity who had a close but subordinate relation to Huang Di in
the battle between Huang Di and Chiyou. This suggests that Yu Shi may be
identified with other deities in different areas and ethnic groups.

YUQIANG
Yuqiang is a descendent of Huang Di. He is the god of the north sea and the god
of wind. He appears as Yujing in some versions.
In several sections of Shanhaijing, Yuqiang’s pedigree, appearance, and
power are described in detail. In a text from chapter 14, Yuqiang is identified as
Yuhao’s son. Yuhao was born by Huang Di, the Yellow Emperor. He lived in the
east sea, and his son Yuqiang lived in the north sea. They both were sea gods.
Two other accounts from Shanhaijing (chapters 8 and 17) depict Yuqiang as a
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 243



god that had a human face and a bird’s body. He pierced his ears with a pair of
dark snakes, and he often stepped on two dark (or red, in a record in chapter 17)
snakes that served as his bearers. This kind of feature corresponds to his mythi
cal power. From his human face and bird’s body, some scholars assume that
Yuqiang was also the wind god. He was actually a god who took charge of affairs
both about the sea and the wind. This may be substantiated by various accounts
in Huainanzi and Lüshi Chunqiu (Annals of Master Lü, third century BC). They
all mention that the northwest wind came from Yuqiang.
In Liezi, another story is recorded that tells how Yuqiang helped the God of
Heaven rearrange the natural order. In the remote area east of the Bohai Sea,
there was a bottomless deep into which all water from every river and other
source flowed. In this deep there stood the five highest mountains. Each moun
tain was 30,000 li (about 10,000 miles) in height and circumference, and the dis
tance between two mountains was 70,000 li (about 23,000 miles). On the top of
these mountains were fantastic scenery and many mythical animals and fruits.
Many gods and demigods lived there. They could fly from one mountain to an
other in one day and night. However, because these mountains did not have
roots, they often floated with the waves and were never still. The gods and
demigods living there worried about this and complained to the God of Heaven.
Yuqiang was in turn asked to deal with the situation. Yuqiang arranged for fif
teen huge sea turtles to carry the mountains on their heads. The turtles were di
vided into three groups. Each group should take a turn in carrying the moun
tains for 60,000 years. From then on the mountains were fixed. It is obvious that
this story has been strongly influenced by the ideas of Taoism; however, it
clearly reflects Yuqiang’s mythical power and important role among all gods.

ZHUANXU
A descendent of Huang Di, Zhuanxu was the God of the North and one of the
Five August Emperors in the mythical history of China. He ordered Zhong and
Li to separate heaven from the earth. He is also known as Gaoyang.
According to a text from Shanhaijing (chapter 18), Zhuanxu was one of
Huang Di’s great-grandsons. He was the son of Hanliu, a grandson of Huang Di
and Leizu. A text from Shiji (chapter 1) states that Zhuanxu is the offspring of
Huang Di and Leizu. However, in that version Zhuanxu is also known as Huang
Di’s grandson. This may be taken as textual evidence of the confusing and con
tradictory elements that often appear in Chinese myths.
In other early texts Zhuanxu’s various mythical powers and great deeds are
mentioned. Some texts depict him as a god who had two dragons as his bearers,
some say that it was he who had arranged the positions of the sun and stars, and
some state that he was the god who defeated Gonggong’s challenge for power
and executed him. Among these, the most well-known versions are the myths
about separating the sky and the earth and those about his identity as the God of
the North.
The myth of separating the sky and the earth can be found in many early
written texts in the Chinese language. The details of the story vary in different
accounts, but they each state that it was Zhuanxu who ordered his subordinates
Zhong and Li to cut off the link between the sky and the earth, which from then
on prevented people from ascending to the sky and also prohibited the deities
from descending to the earth.
A text from Huainanzi (chapter 3) identifies Zhuanxu and another four
gods, Huang Di, Yan Di, Houtu, and Shaohao, as the five great gods correspond
ing to the five basic directions (east, south, west, north, and center) and the five
basic elements (wood, fire, metal, water, and earth). Zhuanxu was the god who
ruled the north, which is associated with water. With the help of his subordinate
Xuanming, he also ruled the sliding weights of steelyards and controlled the sea
son of winter. In the mythical history of China, the five great gods were histori
cized and explained as the Five August Emperors in ancient times. There are
several versions about the names of these divine sovereigns, and Zhuanxu is in
cluded in every version.
After he died, Zhuanxu was said to be buried at Wuyu Mountain with his nine
concubines (Shanhaijing, chapters 8 and 17). He had many offspring, some of
whom were very famous. For example, Zhong and Li, the two deities who sepa
rated the sky and the earth, are introduced as Zhuanxu’s grandsons in some ver
sions. Another example is Pengzu, known as the great-grandson of Zhuanxu in one
text. He is famous in myths and legends for having the longest human life, living

800 years. Zhuanxu also had many offspring who did not inherit their progenitor’s
virtues, such as the three of his sons who died and became pestilent ghosts. One of
them became the ghost who distributes diseases, another became a monster, and
the third became the ghost who scares and harms infants and children.
Nowadays, the Zhuanxu myth is not often told, but Zhuanxu is still wor
shiped in many places as one of the primogenitors of human beings. In Henan,
Hebei, and Shandong provinces there are many different places claiming to be
Zhuanxu’s hometown or the place where his tomb is located. Based on these
kinds of “historical remains,” each of these places has developed local rituals or
customs for Zhuanxu worship. In Neihuang County, Henan Province, for in
stance, there is a place where people believe Zhuanxu was buried; a tomb was
subsequently built for him. Every March 18 in the lunar calendar, a big festival
is held here to celebrate Zhuanxu’s birthday. On this date in 2003, supported and
directed by the local government, the county even had a public worship service
for Zhuanxu. It was said that the number of pilgrims and participants from
mainland China and areas overseas reached 300,000.

ZHULONG
Zhulong is a powerful deity who appears to be part dragon and originates the day
and night, the seasons, and the wind. In his name zhu means “torch” and long
means “dragon.” He appears as Zhuyin (“Torch Shadow”) in other versions.
According to Shanhaijing (chapter 17), Zhulong lived on Zhangwei Moun
tain located north of the Red River, beyond the northwest sea. He was a deity

246



with a human face and a snake’s trunk. His body was completely red and was
1,000 li (about 300 miles) in length. He had vertical eyes in two straight seams.
When his eyes opened there was daylight, and when they closed it became night.
He never ate, slept, or breathed, and he only swallowed the wind and the rain.
This deity could light the darkness to extreme depths under the earth, thus he
was called Zhulong (“Torch Dragon”).
In a similar account from Shanhaijing (chapter 8), Zhulong appears as
Zhuyin. In addition to the features and powers mentioned in the version cited
above, this text describes Zhuyin as a deity who composed the seasons. When he
blew hard it was winter, and when he exhaled hotly it was summer. He neither
drank, ate, nor breathed, but when he did breathe in and out his breath would
make the wind.
The Zhulong myth has interested many scholars, and many different inter
pretations of this myth have been put forward. Among them the most contro
versial hypotheses are those that suggest the myth is a fantastic reflection of ac
tual phenomena that had been seen by ancient people before they composed this
myth. For example, some scholars assume that this myth is in fact a reflection
of a kind of natural spectacle; some argue that it is a description of an active vol
cano; some identify it with the northern polar lights. These perspectives that
trace the origin of a myth based on modern scientific discoveries have stirred

ZHURONG
A descendent of Yan Di (or Huang Di in various texts), Zhurong was the god of
fire and of the south.
According to Shanhaijing (chapter 18), Zhurong was the fifth generation of
Yan Di’s offspring, and he also had many renowned descendants. Yan Di’s wife
Tingyao, a lady from the Red River, gave birth to Yanju; Yanju bore Jiebing; Jiebing
gave birth to Xiqi; and Xiqi bore Zhurong. Zhurong was consigned to the Jiang
River, and he fathered Gonggong, the famous water god. Gonggong in turn fa
thered Shuqi, whose head was square and flat. It was Shuqi who reoccupied his
grandfather’s territory along the Jiang River. Gonggong also sired Houtu, the earth
deity. Houtu bore Shaming, and Shaming begat the twelve months of the year.
However, in another text from the same chapter of Shanhaijing (chapter 16),
Zhurong is identified as the descendent of Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu was an offspring
of Huang Di (Shanhaijing, chapter 18). Therefore, according to this version,
Zhurong was the descendent of Huang Di. The reason for this inconsistency ap
pearing in Shanhaijing, as some scholars explain, is rooted in the argument that
Huang Di and Yan Di originally came from the same clan.
In Shanhaijing (chapter 6) there is a text that describes Zhurong’s appear
ance. He was a deity with a human face and a beast’s body. He rode on two drag
ons, an extraordinary feature that is symbolic of his great powers. As another ac
count from Shanhaijing (chapter 18) states, in accordance with the Supreme
Divinity, Zhurong killed Gun, who stole Xirang from the Supreme Divinity to
prevent the flood.
In texts from Huainanzi and Mozi (written mainly by the philosopher Mo
Di, ca. 468–376 BC), as well as other early documents, Zhurong is depicted as a
god who ruled the south and controlled fire. This identity as the deity of fire and
the south continued and later became more popular in Chinese beliefs. Today
Zhurong has even become an alternate word for fire in many written texts.
Handbook of Chinese Mythology
248



In a version of the Gonggong myth, Zhurong is said to be the god who
fought with Gonggong and defeated him. After his failure, Gonggong became so
angry that he butted into Mount Buzhou and destroyed this sky pillar. There
fore, in some versions of this story, the great goddess Nüwa used colorful stones
to patch the sky, and cut off the tortoise legs to support the heaven. In addition
to Zhurong, Gonggong’s rivals might variously be Di Ku, Zhuanxu, or Shen
nong, very great gods in Chinese mythology. This is a reflection of Zhurong’s
high status in both myth and popular religion.

A very useful book that introduces the most important myths in ancient
China. It provides concise and insightful interpretations and reliable ac
counts that are translated from primary sources in ancient Chinese writings
into English. There is a very comprehensive bibliography arranged in three
parts: classical Chinese texts; Chinese, Japanese, and Western works related
to Chinese mythology; and research works on comparative mythology. In
its foreword, renowned scholar on Chinese mythology Yuan Ke discusses
the main reasons why people are under the false impression that China
lacks a systematic and remarkable mythology.
Bodde, Derk. “Myths of Ancient China.” In Mythologies of the Ancient World,
ed. Samuel Noah Kramer. Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1961, 369–408.
A short but serious work that is still very useful today. Bodde discusses
three problems related to data that scholars of the East and West usually
confront when studying myths of ancient China: those of euhemerization,
of fragmentation and language, and of chronology. He goes on to examine
five examples of creation myths: myths of Pangu, Nüwa, the separation of
heaven and earth, the sun(s), and the flood. In his conclusion, Bodde sum
marizes several features of Chinese mythology.

whole that can be explained by history. Most Han dynasty and other early
authors modified the old traditions in order to make them consistent with
the doctrines of their philosophical school. Karlgren called for a rigorous
and systematic categorization of recordings in order to place them within
their historical and political contexts. He suggested that the texts of classi
cal China should be chronologically separated into those that date back to
pre-Han times (before third century BC) and those that were only fabricated
during the early or late Han period (206 BC–AD 220).

The French sinologist Maspero argues that Chinese scholars always histori
cize Chinese myths by using euhemerism and then interpret myths as real
history, understanding gods as humans. He analyzes three examples from
Shang Shu (Ancient History, also called Shu Jing, The Classic of History,
traditionally said to have been compiled by Confucius, 551–479 BC, but later
mixed with some other texts) that relate to the myths of Xihe, the flood, and
the separation of heaven and earth.
