THE GESTA HUNGARORUM OF ANONYMUS, THE ANONYMOUS
NOTARY OF KING BÉLA
A TRANSLATION
by Martyn Rady
Introduction
The Gesta Hungarorum of the Anonymous Notary of King Béla is the oldest extant
chronicle of the history of the Hungarians. It remains ‘the most famous, the most
obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts.’1
Purporting to be an account of the background, circumstances and immediate
aftermath of the Hungarian conquest of Pannonia in the late ninth century, it was most
probably composed in the early years of the thirteenth century by a chancellery clerk
who had formerly been in the service of King Béla III of Hungary (1172-1196). The
extant version, which survives in a late thirteenth century copy, is apparently
incomplete.2 The sole MS, consisting of 24 folios, was first noted in the library of
Schloss Ambras, outside Innsbruck, in the seventeenth century, from where it was
moved to Vienna in 1665, and much later, in 1928, to Budapest.3 Although details of
the MS were included in two printed seventeenth-century catalogues of the imperial
library, its text was not published until 1746.4 Between then and the end of the
nineteenth century, the MS was re-published more than a dozen times.5 A scholarly
edition, with critical annotation, was first published by Gyula Pauler and László
Fejérpataky in 1900,6 and a revised edition by Emil Jakubovich and Dezső Pais in the
first volume of Imre Szentpétery’s Scriptores Rerum Hungaricarum (2 vols,



2
Budapest, 1937; hereafter, SRH).7 The Latin text has been translated several times into
Hungarian, most notably by Pais,8 as well as into Romanian and German.9 What
follows is the first rendering of the Latin text into English.
There can scarcely be any document from the Middle Ages that carries such
heavy political baggage. The description which the author gives of the presence and
whereabouts of peoples in Central Europe during the ninth century has been
extensively used to buttress historical claims to territories in the twentieth century.
Readings of the Gesta Hungarorum were thus used after 1918 to justify the cession of
Transylvania to Romania as well as, after the Second World War, of Oroszvár to
Czechoslovakia.10 In 1987, the Gesta acquired particular notoriety on account of a
full-page advertisement in The Times, paid for by the Romanian government,
affirming the validity of the chronicler’s account of a Romanian presence in the
Carpathian basin more than a thousand years before.11 Fortunately, modern scholarly
readings of the Gesta Hungarorum are less beset by political partisanship since, in the
post-Schengen world of the EU, only dinosaurs care about who was where first.
Nevertheless, former interpretations of phrases, locations, persons and word-strings,
preserved in an older literature, may yet serve to confuse the unwary, while in remote
academic corners the Jurassic Age is still not quite over.
The author of the Gesta, known historically as the Anonymus (always thus),
pretends to give a historically-grounded account of early Hungarian history that
disregards the songs of minstrels and the yarns of yokels,12 but does in fact nothing of
the sort. Anonymus’s account is essentially a ‘toponymic romance’ that seeks to
explain place-names by reference to imagined events and persons. Although he gets
the names of the earliest Hungarian rulers right, as well as some of the early tribal
chieftains, he has the Hungarians beating Slavonic and Romanian leaders whose



3
names are not attested to anywhere else, as well as fighting the Cumans (who
appeared in Europe only in the late eleventh century) and, more incredibly, the
Romans. His description of power-relations north of the Danube in the late ninth
century is not supported by any other account. It is at best an attempt to project
contemporary conditions backwards.
Clearly, there is a bit of correct history in Anonymus’s work, and at least a few
of his heroes can be ‘cross-checked’ against information given by Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, Liudprand of Cremona and the Annals of St Gall.13 Anonymus also
borrows, extensively in places, from Regino of Prum and his continuator,14 and he
plainly relies in part on diverse written accounts, some of which would later feed into
Simon Kézai’s late thirteenth-century Gesta as well as the ‘royal chronicles’ of the
Angevin and later periods.15 All three, at least, have shaven Cuman heads being sliced
like ripe gourds. Contradictory information given in his sources may also explain the
uncertainties of Anonymus’s first few chapters and of Álmos and Árpád’s ambiguous
relation to the line of Attila. Additionally, Anonymus may have had at his disposal a
‘List of Donations’, enumerating which kindreds and clans had been given land of the
ruler.16 Although we doubt very much that sophisticated ‘beneficiary’ relations
existed in Hungary before 1200, it is noticeable that many chapters conclude with
references to land-grants. The extent to which the author relied upon ‘oral traditions’
cannot, however, be tested.
The identity of Anonymus is, appropriately, uncertain, although valiant
attempts have been made to uncloak him. His style is of a French school, probably
Paris or Orleans. He has some knowledge of Hungarian that he uses to support his
etymologies but he handles terminal vowels and the Hungarian ‘dative’, -nec/nek
ending as if unaware of Hungarian grammar.17 He is possibly the first European writer



4
to call the Black Sea as such, which (along with several other indicators) may suggest
understanding of a Turkic language.18 Anonymus’s knowledge of Hungary would,
likewise, appear patchy. His account of the geography of the regions bordering the
Upper Tisza and Middle Danube is detailed, but elsewhere his descriptions are thin.19
The most that can be said about him is that his name began with a P.20 His friend, N,
is probably, however, a literary fiction.
In what follows, we have not attempted to reconcile Anonymus’s account with
other existing chronicles of early Hungarian history. This has been done already, by
C.A. Macartney, in some extensive works of almost impenetrable scholarship that
have been recently republished.21 Only in a few places, have we indicated the more
substantial textual borrowings. For individual words and phrases, the reader is
directed to speculations in the SRH edition and to the cross-referencing to the
Alexandrine romances and other epic literature undertaken by Győry and, more
recently, by Silagi and Veszprémy.22 Nor have we sought to ‘modernize’ the names of
most persons and places, since this might be taken as evidence of partisanship with a
specific historian or reading. Only where the identities of places and persons are
beyond dispute have we translated them out of the Latin. At the expense of
consistency, we have retained the indeterminacy of U/V capitalization as well as the
terminal ‘u’ vowel found in Old Hungarian proper names. The Latin text followed
here is that provided in the SRH, matched against the original as read in facsimile.23 In
places, where the terminology or nomenclature is of linguistic or historical interest,
we have given the original Latin in parentheses or footnotes. Our translation preserves
the repetitious and breathless quality of the original text.

______________________________________________________
Here begins the Prologue to the Deeds of the Hungarians
P. the said master and notary of the late most glorious Béla, king of Hungary, of fond
memory, to N. his most dear friend, a venerable man and steeped in the knowledge of
letters: Greetings, and the answer to his plea. For when we were studying together at
school and reading with equal enthusiasm the story of Troy that I had prepared in one
volume in my own style, bringing most lovingly together what I had heard from the
books of Dares Phrygius24 and other authors as well as from my masters, you asked
me that, in the same way as I had written on the history of Troy and on the wars of the
Greeks, so to write for you of the genealogy [genealogia] of the kings of Hungary and
of their noblemen: how the seven leading persons, who are called the Hetumoger,25
came down from the Scythian land, what that Scythian land was like and how Duke
Álmos was born and why Álmos, from whom the kings of Hungary trace their origin,
is called the first duke of Hungary, and how many realms and rulers they conquered
and why the people coming forth from the Scythian land are called Hungarians in the
speech of foreigners but Magyars [Mogerii] in their own. I did indeed promise that I
would do so, but hindered by other matters, I might have almost entirely forgotten
your request and my promise, had not your love admonished me in a letter to
discharge the debt. Mindful therefore of your love, and although hindered by the
many and varied affairs of this wearisome world, I am, supported by God’s grace,
ready to do what you have ordered, according to what has been handed down by
various historians, seeing it as best that it be not lost to a future generation in the time
to come. I consider it best that I should write to you truthfully and plainly, so that



6
reading it they may know what took place. And it would be most unworthy and
completely unfitting for the so most noble people of Hungary to hear as if in a dream
of the beginnings of their kind [primordia sue generationis] and of their bravery and
deeds from the false stories of countryfolk and the gabbling song of minstrels.26 May
they not more nobly perceive the truth of matters from the sure explanation of texts
and the straightforward exposition of historical accounts? Hence happy Hungary, to
which many gifts are given, should rejoice all hours in its gift of letters, because it has
the beginning of its line of kings and noblemen, for which kings shall be praise and
honour to the King Eternal and the holy Mary, His mother, through whose grace the
kings of Hungary and noblemen have the kingdom for happy purpose here and ever
after. Amen.
1. Of Scythia
Scythia is then a very great land, called Dentumoger,27 over towards the east, the end
of which reaches westwards to the Black Sea [Nigrum Pontem]. On the far side, it has
a river with great marshes, called the Don [Thanais], where sables can be found in
such extraordinary abundance that not only nobles and ignobles dress in them but also
with which even ox-herds, swine-herds and shepherds adorn their raiment in that land.
Gold and silver abound there and in the rivers of this land precious stones and gems.
On its eastern side, neighbouring Scythia, were the peoples ‘Gog and Magog’,28
whom Alexander the Great walled in.29 Scythia is very marshy in its length and
breadth, and indeed the men who dwell there, commonly called Dentumoger, have
right up to the present day never been subject to the sway of any emperor. The
Scythians are certainly an ancient people and the strength of Scythia lies in the east, as
we said above. And the first king of Scythia was Magog, son of Japhet, and this



7
people were called after him Moger, from whose royal line the most renowned and
mighty King Attila descended, who, in the 451st year of Our Lord’s birth, coming
down from Scythia, entered Pannonia with a mighty force and, putting the Romans to
flight, took the realm and made a royal residence for himself beside the Danube above
the hot springs,30 and he ordered all the old buildings that he found there to be
restored and he built them in a circular and very strong wall that in the Hungarian
language is now called Budavár [Buduuar] and by the Germans Etzelburg
[Ecilburgu].31 What more! We will keep to the story. A long time after, there
descended from the progeny of the same King Magog, Vgek, father of Duke Álmos,
from whom the dukes and kings of Hungary trace their origin, as will be said in what
follows. The Scythians, as we said, are indeed an ancient people, of whom historians
writing of the deeds of the Romans, said as follows:32 That the Scythian people was
most wise and gentle; they did not work the soil nor barely knew any sin among them.
And they did not have homes built by craft but rather tents made of felt. They ate
meat and fish and milk and honey and they had much spice. And their clothes were of
the pelts of sables and other wild beasts. They had gold, silver and gems as common
as stones, which they found in the rivers of this land. They desired no one else’s
goods, for they were all rich, having many animals and sufficient victuals. And there
were no adulterers, for every man kept only to his wife. But, later, this people, worn
out in war, became, as some historians tell, so cruel that they ate in wrath human flesh
and drank the blood of humans. And I believe that you may still know a hardy nation
by its fruits. The Scythian people were never subjugated by any emperor. For the
Scythians made Darius, king of the Persians, flee with the greatest ignominy, and
Darius lost there 80,000 men and so fled in great fear to Persia. Next, the Scythians
slew Cyrus, king of Persia, with 330,000 men. Next, the Scythians put to base flight



8
even Alexander the Great himself, the son of King Philip and Queen Olympias, who
had conquered many kingdoms in war. And the Scythian race was hardy so as to
endure all toil and the Scythians were big in body and bold in war. And they had
nothing in the world that they feared to lose for an injury done to them. And when the
Scythians had a victory, they wished nothing of booty, as do their posterity today, but
sought only praise for it. And except for Darius, Cyrus and Alexander, no people in
the world dared enter their land. The aforesaid Scythian people were indeed hardy in
combat and, on speedy mounts and with helmeted heads, they were better with bows
and arrows than all the other nations of the world, and you will know this to be so
from their offspring. And the Scythian land, as much as it is distant from the tropics,
is as healthy for the generating of families. And although spacious enough, it was still
insufficient to sustain or keep the host of peoples begotten there. On account of this,
the seven leading persons, who are called the Hetumoger, not tolerating the pressures
of space, thought very greatly of a solution. Then these seven leading persons, having
taken counsel together, decided that they should forsake the soil of their birth and take
for themselves such lands as they could inhabit, as will be said in what follows.
2. Why they are called Hungarians
It now remains to say why the people who set forth from the Scythian land are called
Hungarians. The Hungarians are so called from the castle of Ung [Hungu] where the
seven leading persons, having subjugated the Slavs, tarried for a time upon entering
the land of Pannonia. On account of this, all the nations round about called Álmos,
son of Vgek, the duke of Hunguar [Ungvár] and they called his warriors
Hunguarians.33 What more! Passing over these matters, we shall return to our task,
keep to our story, and, as the Holy Spirit commands, finish the work begun.

3. Of Álmos, the first duke
In the 819th year of Our Lord’s birth, Vgek, who, as we said above, being of the
family of King Magog became a long time later the most noble duke of Scythia, took
to wife in Dentumoger the daughter of Duke Eunedubelian, called Emesu, from whom
he sired a son, who was named Álmos. But he is called Álmos from a divine event,
because when she was pregnant a divine vision appeared to his mother in a dream in
the form of a falcon that, as if coming to her, impregnated her and made known to her
that from her womb a torrent would come forth and from her loins glorious kings be
generated, but that they would not increase in their land. Because, therefore, a dream
is called almu in the Hungarian language and his birth was predicted in a dream, so he
was called Álmos. Or he is thus called Álmos, that is holy, because holy kings and
dukes were born of his line.34 What more!
4. Of Duke Álmos
And Duke Álmos, after he was born into the world, brought great joy to Duke Ugek
and his kinsmen and to almost all the leading men of Scythia because his father Vgek
was of the line of King Magog. For Álmos himself was handsome of face, but dark,
and he had dark eyes, but big ones; tall and lean in stature, he had indeed large hands
and wide fingers, and this Álmos was pious, benevolent, generous, tall, wise, a good
soldier, and a giver of cheer to all those who were at that time warriors in the Scythian
realm. And when this Álmos came to full age, as if the gift of the Holy Spirit was in
him, although he was a pagan, he became yet more powerful and wiser than all the
dukes of Scythia and they conducted all the business of the realm at that time with his
counsel and help. And Duke Álmos, when he to came to full age of youth, took a wife



10
in that land, the daughter of a certain most noble duke, from whom he sired a son by
the name of Árpád, whom he took with him into Pannonia, as will be said in the
following.
5. Of the election of Duke Álmos
The Hungarian people, most valiant and most powerful in the tasks of war thus
originated, as we said above, from the Scythian people that is called in its own
language Dentumoger. And their land was so full on account of the host of people
born there that it was insufficient to sustain or keep them, as we said above. On
account of this, the seven leading persons, who right up to the present day are called
the Hetumoger, finding the physical constraints unendurable, having taken counsel
among themselves to quit the soil of their birth, did not cease seeking in battle and
war to occupy lands that they might live in. Then they chose to seek for themselves
the land of Pannonia that they had heard from rumour had been the land of King
Attila, from whose line Duke Álmos, father of Árpád, descended. Then these seven
leading persons realized from their common and true counsel that they could not
complete the journey begun unless they had a duke and ruler among them. Thus by
the free will and common consent of the seven leading persons, they chose as their
duke and ruler Álmos, son of Vgek, and those who descended from his kin, sons of
sons to the last generation, because Duke Álmos was the son of Vgek, and those who
descended from his kin were more outstanding by birth and more powerful in battle.
These seven leading persons were noblemen by birth and strong in war, firm in their
faithfulness. Then they said with equal will to Duke Álmos: From today we choose
you as duke and ruler and where your fortune takes you, there will we follow you.
Then to Duke Álmos the aforesaid men swore an oath, confirmed in pagan manner



11
with their own blood spilled in a single vessel. And, although pagans, they
nevertheless kept true to the oath that they now made among themselves, until they
died.
6. Of their oath
The first part of the oath was thus: That, as long as life remained, they and their
descendants would always have a duke from the line of Duke Álmos. The second part
of the oath was thus: That whatever goods they might acquire by their own efforts,
none of them should be denied a share of them. The third part of the oath was thus:
That those leading men who by their free will had chosen Álmos as their lord, they
and their sons, should never in any way be excluded from the counsel of the duke and
the honour of the realm [honore regni]. The fourth part of the oath was thus: That if
any of their posterity should be unfaithful to the person of the duke and stir up discord
between the duke and his kinsmen, then the blood of the guilty one should be shed,
just as their own blood had been shed in the oath that they had made to Duke Álmos.
The fifth part of the oath was thus: That if any of the posterity of Duke Álmos and of
the other leading men should seek to breach parts of their oath, they should be put
under an everlasting curse. The names of the seven men were these: Álmos, father of
Árpád; Eleud, father of Zobolsu, from whom the Saac kindred descends; Cundu,
father of Curzan; Ound, father of Ete, from whom the Calan and Colsoy kindreds
descend; Tosu, father of Lel; Huba, from whom the Zemera kindred descends; and the
seventh was Tuhutum, father of Horca, whose sons were Gyyla and Zombor, from
whom the Maglout kindred descend, as will be said below.35 What more! We will
keep to our story.



12
7. On their setting forth
In the 884th year of Our Lord’s birth, as is contained in the yearly chronicles,36 the
seven leading persons who are called the Hetumoger set forth from the Scythian land
towards the west. Among them, there set forth from the same region Duke Álmos, son
of Ugek, of the line of King Magog, a man of good repute, their lord and counsellor,
together with his wife and his son, Árpád, and the two sons of his uncle Hulec,
namely Zuard and Cadusa, and with a great and innumerable host of associated
peoples. Advancing for very many days across empty places, they swam across the
river Etyl37 sitting on leather bags [tulbou] in pagan manner and they never came
across a path leading to a city or house. Nor did they consume of the toils of men,38 as
was their custom, but ate meat and fish until they reached Russia [Rusciam] which is
called Suzdal [Susudal]. And their young men hunted almost every day, whence from
that day until now the Hungarians are better at hunting than other peoples. And so
Duke Álmos and all his own came and entered Russia which is called Suzdal.
8. Of Ruthenia
Arriving in the lands of the Russians, they reached the city of Kiev [Kyeu] without
any opposition and, as they passed through the city of Kiev, crossing the river Dnieper
[Deneper], they sought to conquer the realm of the Ruthenes [Rutenorum]. Then the
dukes of the Ruthenes, learning of this, feared greatly because they had heard that
Duke Álmos, son of Vgek, was of the line of King Attila, to whom their forefathers
had every year paid tribute. Nevertheless, the duke of Kiev [Hyeu] and all the leaders,
having gathered and taken counsel among themselves, decided that they should do
battle with Duke Álmos and that they preferred to die in war than to forfeit their own
realms and be subjected against their will to Duke Álmos. Forthwith, the duke of



13
Kiev, despatching envoys, asked the seven dukes of the Cumans, his most faithful
friends, for help. Then these seven dukes, whose names were these— Ed, Edum, Etu,
Bunger, Ousad, father of Ursuur, Boyta, and Ketel, father of Oluptulma
accompanied by no small host of horsemen, came most speedily against Duke Álmos
for the sake of the duke of Kiev’s friendship. And the duke of Kiev with his army
advanced against them and supported by the Cumans began to oppose Duke Álmos
with an armed host. But Duke Álmos, whose help was the Holy Spirit, attired with
arms, his battle-line ordered, went mounted on his horse here and there encouraging
his warriors and, as the attack commenced, he stood before all his men and said: O,
Scythians, my fellow warriors and most brave men, be mindful of the start of your
wanderings when you said that such land as you could inhabit you would take by arms
and war. Do not therefore be troubled by the host of Ruthenes and Cumans, who are
as our dogs. For do not dogs, when they hear the words of their masters, start to
tremble? Because strength does not rest in the numbers of a people but in resolution of
the spirit. Do you not know, as the philosopher says, that a single lion may put to
flight many deer?39 But in short I say to you: who can stand against the warriors of
Scythia? Did not the Scythians put to flight Darius, king of the Persians, and so in fear
and the greatest disgrace he fled to Persia and lost there 80,000 men? And did not the
Scythians destroy Cyrus, king of the Persians, with 330,000 men. And did not the
Scythians put to base flight even Alexander the Great, son of King Philip and Queen
Olympias, who had conquered many kingdoms. So let us fight bravely and
courageously those who are as our dogs and let us fear their host as a swarm of flies.
Hearing this, the warriors of Duke Álmos were much encouraged and they at once
sounded on all sides the trumpets of war, and both lines of foes came together and
they began to fight each other fiercely, and many Ruthenes and Cumans were slain.



14
The aforesaid dukes of the Ruthenes and Cumans, seeing that they were losing the
battle, turned in flight and, hastening to save their lives, entered the city of Kiev. Duke
Álmos and his warriors pursued the Ruthenes and Cumans up to the city of Kiev and
the warriors of Duke Álmos broke the shaven heads of the Cumans as if fresh
gourds.40 The dukes of the Ruthenes and Cumans, having entered the city, seeing the
bravery of the Scythians, stayed there dumbly.
9. Of the peace between the duke and the Ruthenes
With victory won, Duke Álmos and his warriors conquered the lands of the Ruthenes
and, seizing their goods, began in the second week to invest the city of Kiev. And
when they began to place their ladders on the wall, the dukes of the Cumans and
Ruthenes, seeing the bravery of the Scythians, feared greatly. And when they realized
that they could not resist them, the duke of Kiev and the other dukes of the Ruthenes
and of the Cumans who were there, having despatched envoys, asked Duke Álmos
and his leading men to make peace with them. When the envoys came to Duke Álmos
and asked him that their masters be not expelled from their homes, Duke Álmos,
having taken counsel with his men, answered the envoys of the Ruthenes that the
dukes and their chief men should give their sons as hostages, and that they should pay
every year a tribute of 10,000 marks and, in addition, food, clothes and other
necessities. The dukes of the Ruthenes, albeit unwillingly, nevertheless conceded all
these things to Duke Álmos, but they told Duke Álmos that, after leaving the land of
Galicia,41 they should descend westward beyond the Havas [Houos] wood into the
land of Pannonia, that had previously been the land of King Attila, and they
recommended to them the land of Pannonia as being good beyond measure. For they
said that there flowed the most noble spring waters, the Danube and Tisza [Tyscia]



15
and other most noble springs, abounding in good fish, in which land there lived the
Slavs [Sclavi], Bulgarians [Bulgarii] and Vlachs [Blachii], and the shepherds of the
Romans [pastores Romanorum].42 For after the death of King Attila, the Romans said
the land of Pannonia was pastureland because their flocks grazed in the land of
Pannonia. And rightly is the land of Pannonia said to be the pastureland of the
Romans, for now too the Romans graze on the goods of Hungary.43 What more?
10. Of the seven dukes of the Cumans
Duke Álmos and his chief men, taking counsel among themselves, agreed to the
request of the dukes of the Ruthenes and made peace with them. Then the dukes of the
Ruthenes, namely of Kiev and Suzdal, lest they be expelled from their homes, gave
their sons as hostages to Duke Álmos and sent with them 10,000 marks and a
thousand horses with saddles and bridles decorated in Ruthene fashion, and a hundred
Cuman boys and forty camels for carrying loads, numberless pelts of ermine
[ermelinas] and mink [griseas] and many other gifts beyond count. Then the
aforenamed dukes of the Cumans, namely Ed, Edumen, Etu, Bunger, father of Borsu,
Ousad, father of Vrsuuru, Boyta, from whom the kindred of Brucsa descends, and
Ketel, father of Oluptulma, when they saw the kindliness with which Duke Álmos
treated the Ruthenes, prostrated themselves at his feet and of their own will subjected
themselves to Duke Álmos, saying: From today we choose you as our lord and master
until the last generation and where your fortune leads you, there will we follow you.
What they had said in words to Duke Álmos, they moreover confirmed in pagan
manner with a sworn pledge and, in the same way, Duke Álmos and his chief men
bound themselves to them with a sworn pledge. Then these seven dukes of the
Cumans together with their wives and sons and a great host agreed to come to



16
Pannonia. Similarly, many Ruthenes, joining Duke Álmos, came with him to
Pannonia. Their descendants still live today in various places in Hungary.
11. Of the cities of Lodomer and Galicia
Then Duke Álmos and the other leading persons who are called the Hetumoger, and
the dukes of the Cumans with their kinsmen, servants and serving women, set forth
from Kiev and, led by the Kievan Ruthenes, came to the city of Lodomer.44 The duke
of Lodomer and his chief men went forth with divers precious gifts to the borders of
the kingdom to meet Duke Álmos and even opened the city of Lodomer to him. And
Duke Álmos stayed in that place with all his men for three weeks and in the third
week the duke of Lodomer gave to Duke Álmos as hostages his two sons together
with all the sons of his chief servants [iobagionum] and, in addition, he presented both
to the duke and his leading men 2000 marks of silver and a hundred marks of refined
gold, with innumerable furs and cloaks, and 300 horses with saddles and bridles, and
twenty-five camels, and a thousand oxen for carrying loads, and other countless gifts.
And in the fourth week Duke Álmos came with his men to Galicia and there he chose
a place of repose for himself and his men. When the duke of Galicia heard this, he
with all his men went barefoot to Duke Álmos and presented divers gifts for his
pleasure and, having opened the gate of the city of Galicia, he welcomed him as his
lord and he gave as hostage his only son together with the sons of the leading men of
the kingdom and, in addition, he gave ten of the very best steeds and 300 horses with
saddles and bridles, and 3000 marks of silver and 200 marks of gold and the most
noble raiment both for the duke and all his warriors as well. After Duke Álmos had
taken repose in Galicia for a month, the duke of Galicia and his other companions,
whose sons had been given as hostages, told Duke Álmos and his noblemen to



17
descend westwards beyond the Alps [Havas] into the land of Pannonia. For they said
to them that the land there was very good and that there flowed there the most noble
springs, whose names were, as we said above,45 the Danube, Tisza, Vág [Wag], Maros
[Morisius], Körös [Crisius], Temes [Temus] and others, that it had first been the land
of King Attila and that after his death the Roman princes had taken possession of the
land of Pannonia, up to the Danube, where they had gathered their shepherds. But the
great Kean [Keanus magnus], duke of Bulgaria, grandfather of Duke Salan [Salanus],
had taken possession of the land that lies between the Danube and the Tisza, as far as
the borders of the Ruthenes and the Poles, and had made the Slavs and Bulgarians live
there. Duke Morout, whose grandson was called by the Hungarians Menumorout,46
because he had concubines, had taken possession of the land between the Tisza and
Igfon wood, that lies towards Transylvania [ad Erdeuelu], from the Maros river up to
the Szamos [Zomus], and the peoples that are called Cozar47 inhabited that land. A
certain duke called Glad coming from the castle of Vidin [Bundyn] had with the help
of the Cumans taken possession of the land from the Maros [Mors] river up to the
castle of Orsova [Vrscia]. From his line was born Ajtony [Ohtum], who a long time
later, at the time of the holy King Stephen, Csanád [Sunad], son of Doboka [Dobuca]
and nephew of the king, slew in his castle beside the Maros because he was rebellious
to the king in all his doings. To him the aforesaid king gave for his good service the
wife and castle of Ajtony, together with all its appurtenances, as it is the practice of
good lords to reward faithful men, and this castle is now called Csanád.48 What more!
12. How they entered Pannonia
Duke Álmos and his chief men, agreeing to the counsels of the Ruthenes, made a most
lasting peace with them. For the dukes of the Ruthenes, lest they be expelled from



18
their homes, had given, as we said above, their sons as hostages along with countless
gifts. Then the duke of Galicia ordered 2000 archers and 3000 countryfolk
[rusticorum] to go in advance to prepare for them a way through the Havas wood as
far as the border at Ung, and he loaded all their beasts of burden with victuals and
other necessities and gave them innumerable flocks for food. Then the seven leading
persons, who are called the Hetumoger, and the seven dukes of the Cumans, whose
names we said above, together with their kinsmen, servants and serving women set
forth with the counsel and help of the Ruthenes to the land of Pannonia. And so,
coming through the Havas wood, they descended to the districts of Ung. And when
they arrived there, they called the place that they first occupied Munkács [Muncas]
because they had arrived after the greatest toil at the land that they had chosen for
themselves.49 Then they rested there for forty days and they loved the land more than
can be said. The inhabitants of the land, the Slavs, hearing of their arrival, feared
greatly and of their own accord submitted to Duke Álmos because they had heard that
Duke Álmos was descended of the line of King Attila. And although the men were
Duke Salan’s, they still served Duke Álmos with great honour and dread, offering to
their lord, as is fitting, all that was needed to eat. And such fear and dread overtook
the inhabitants of the land that they cringed before the duke and his leading men, like
servants to their own lords, and they extolled to them the fertility of their land and told
how, after the death of King Attila, the great Kean, forbear of Duke Salan and duke of
Bulgaria, setting forth with the aid and counsel of the emperor of the Greeks, had
occupied that land, how the Slavs and had been led from the land of Bulgaria to the
border of the Ruthenes and how Salan, their duke, now held them and theirs and how
much power he had over his neighbours.



19
13. Of the castle of Ung
Then, hearing these things, Duke Álmos and his leading men were especially
gladdened and they rode to the castle of Ung in order to capture it. And as they
encamped around the wall, the count of the castle, Loborc by name, who in their
language was called duca, hastened in flight to castle Zemlum,50 and the warriors of
the duke, pursuing and capturing him next to some river, hanged him by a noose there
and on that day they called the river by his name, Loborc. Then Duke Álmos and his
men, entering Ung castle, made great sacrifices to the immortal gods [diis
inmortalibus] and feasted for four days. And on the fourth day, having had counsel
and taken an oath from all his men, Duke Álmos while yet still living appointed his
son, Árpád, as duke and leader, and he was called Árpád, duke of Hunguaria, and
from Ung [Hungu] all his warriors were called Hunguarians in the language of foreign
nations [linguam alienigenarum], and that name persists throughout the whole world
up to now.51
14. Of Duke Árpád
In the 903rd year of Our Lord’s birth, Duke Árpád, having despatched his armies, took
for himself the whole land that is between the Tisza and the Bodrog, as far as Ugocsa
[Vgosam], together with all its inhabitants, and he besieged the castle of Borsoa and
on the third day of fighting took it; he destroyed its walls, and he ordered the warriors
of Duke Salan whom he found there to be taken in fetters to the castle of Ung. And
while staying there for some days, the duke and his men, seeing the fertility of the
land and the abundance of all beasts and the fullness of the fishes of the Tisza and
Bodrog rivers, loved the land more than can be said. When Duke Salan eventually
heard from those of his men who had taken to flight of all that had happened, he did



20
not dare raise his hand but, having sent his envoys, began to threaten in Bulgarian
fashion, as is their custom, and he greeted Duke Árpád of Hungary mockingly, and he
jokingly called his men Hunguarians, and he began to wonder in many ways who they
were and whence they who dared to do such things had come, and he instructed them
to make good their misdeeds and not to cross in any way the Bodrog river, lest he,
with the help of the Greeks and Bulgarians, repaying in kind to them their own ill
deed, should let scarcely any of them return home to tell that they had escaped. The
envoys of Duke Salan, coming to the castle of Zemlin and having crossed the Bodrog
[Budrug] river, reached Duke Árpád on the second day, and on the third day they
greeted Duke Árpád with the words of their lord and relayed to Duke Árpád his
message. Duke Árpád having heard the embassy of the haughty duke, replied not
haughtily, but humbly, saying: Although my forbear, the most powerful King Attila,
had the land which lies between the Danube and the Tisza as far as the border of the
Bulgarians, which he, your master, has, I nevertheless, not because I fear that I may
be unable to withstand the Greeks and Bulgarians, but rather for the friendship of
Salan, your duke, ask as my right one little place for my flocks, namely the land up to
the River Louiou,52 and in addition I ask your lord to send me of his grace two small
bottles filled with the water of the Danube and one bag of herbs of the sands of Olpar
so that I may test whether the herbs of the sands of Olpar are sweeter than the herbs of
the Scythian, that is Dentumoger, and whether the waters of the Danube are better
than the waters of the Don [Thanaydis]. And having given this message to them, he
enriched them with divers gifts and having won their goodwill he ordered them home.
Then Duke Árpád, having taken counsel, likewise sent his envoys to Duke Salan and
sent to him twelve white horses and twelve camels and twelve Cuman boys and, for
the duchess, twelve most nimble Ruthene girls and twelve ermine pelts and twelve



21
sables and twelve golden cloaks. And in that embassy were sent out of the more noble
persons Oundu, father of Ethe; secondly Ketel, father of Oluptulma; and, thirdly, they
sent the most energetic warrior, Tursol by name, for reconnaissance, to inspect the
quality of the land and, returning speedily, to report to his lord, Duke Árpád.
15. Of the castle of Komárom
The envoys of Duke Árpád, Oundu, father of Ethe, Ketel, father of Oluptulma, and
Turzol, the Cuman warrior, whose line perished with him, coming to the River
Bodrog, swam across at that place where a little river, running by Saturholmu, flows
into the Bodrog. And thus having crossed the Bodrog river, when they rejoicing
crossed the aforesaid little river, then by the swell of the waters and with his horse
blundering, Ketel sank into the water, and with his companions’ help narrowly
escaped death.53 Then that river was jokingly called by Ketel’s companions
Ketelpotaca.54 And afterwards Duke Árpád gave by his grace to Ketel the whole land
with its inhabitants from Satorholmu to the Tulsuoa river, and he gave not just this but
more besides because, after Duke Árpád had conquered the whole land of Pannonia,
he gave to Ketel for his most faithful service a great land beside the Danube where the
Vág river flows. There Oluptulma, Ketel’s son, built a castle that is called Komárom
[Camarum]. For servicing that castle, he gave two parts both for the people he had
brought with him and for those obtained by the duke.55 A long time later, Ketel and
his son, Tulma, were buried there in pagan manner, but his descendants had that land,
which is now called Ketelpotaca, to the times of King Andrew, son of Ladislas the
Bald.56 Nevertheless, King Andrew exchanged that land with the descendants of Ketel
for two reasons: first, because it was suitable to kings for hunting; secondly, because
his wife liked to dwell in those parts because they were closer to her native soil, as she



22
was the daughter of the duke of the Ruthenes and feared the arrival of the emperor of
the Germans, lest he should enter Hungary to avenge the blood of King Peter, as will
be told in what follows.57
16. Of Mount Turzol
Then Ound, Ketel and Turzol, crossing the wood beside the Bodrog river, riding as if
in a race, flying on the fleetest horses, climbed the summit of a high mountain. Turzol,
the most energetic warrior, being in front, reached the top of the mountain first of all
and, from that time till now, they call that mountain Mount Turzol. Then these three
lords, viewing as far as may the human eye the land on all sides from the summit of
the mountain, loved it more than can be said and in that place they made a great
sacrifice [magnum aldamas] in pagan manner, killing the plumpest horse. Turzol,
having taken leave of his companions, as he was a courageous man and faithful in
arms, returned with his warriors to Duke Árpád to report to him the fruits of that land.
And he did so. Ound and Ketel, riding a most speedy course, having gone forth from
Mount Turzol, found on the third day Duke Salan in the castle of Opar [sic] beside the
Tisza, whom they greeted on behalf of Árpád and, on the second day, after entering
his court, they presented the gifts that they had brought with them and relayed to him
the message of Duke Árpád. Duke Salan, having seen the gifts and heard what they
and his own men had to say, was especially happy and he graciously welcomed the
envoys and enriched them with divers gifts and, moreover, agreed to Árpád’s
requests. On the tenth day, Ound and Ketel, having taken leave of Duke Salan,
prepared to go home, and through them Duke Salan mockingly sent to Duke Árpád
along with divers gifts two bottles filled with the water of the Danube and a bag of the
best herbs from the sands of Olpar and, moreover, he granted the land up to the Sajó



23
[Souyoy] river together with its inhabitants. Then Ound and Ketel together with the
envoys of Duke Salan, going quickly to Duke Árpád, presented the gifts that had been
sent and said that the land along with its inhabitants had been granted to Duke Árpád.
On account of this, the greatest joy arose in the court of Duke Árpád and they
celebrated with a great feast for three days. And then, with peace confirmed, he sent
home the peace-bearing envoys of Duke Salan, enriched with divers gifts.
17. Of Szerencs [Zerencze]
Duke Árpád and his noblemen, setting out with great joy from Ung castle pitched
camp beyond Mount Turzol on the plain beside the Tucota river as far as Mount
Szerencs [ad montem Zerenche] and, seeing from the mountains the quality of the
place, they called that place ‘lovely’ which is said in their language zerelmes, because
they loved that place greatly, and from that day until now the place is called Szerencse
from zerelmu. There Duke Árpád and all his leading men, together with his whole
household, putting toil aside and building huts [factis tuguriis], chose for themselves a
place of repose and they stayed there for not a few days while they conquered all the
neighbouring places, namely as far as the Sajó river and the Castle of Salt [Castrum
Salis].58 And there beside the Tocota and within the woods Árpád gave many lands at
various places along with their inhabitants to Edunec and Edumernec.59 Their
descendants have, with the aid of divine grace, been worthy to keep the lands till now.
The aforesaid Turzol obtained through the grace of Duke Árpád a great land at the
bottom of the mountain, where the Bodrog [Brudrug] flows into the Tisza, and in that
place he built an earthen fort, which is now presently called Hymusuduor.
18. Of Borsod



24
And while these things were taking root, then by common counsel and on the advice
of all the inhabitants, Borsu, son of Bunger, was sent with a strong force to the land of
the Poles to view the borders of the kingdom [confinia regni] and to reinforce them
with obstacles as far as Mount Turtur,60 and he built in a suitable place a castle to
defend the kingdom. Having taken leave, Borsu went forth and having by good luck
gathered a throng of countryfolk he built a castle beside the Buldua river that is called
by that people Borsod, because it was small.61 Bors, having taken the sons of the
inhabitants as hostages and putting boundary markers along the mountains of Turtur,
returned to Duke Árpád and there was great joy in the court of the duke at the return
of Borsu. The duke then as a reward [pro beneficio suo] appointed Bors count in that
castle and gave him complete responsibility for that district.
19. Of the Duke of Bihar62
After spending several days, Duke Árpád, having taken the advice of his noblemen,
sent envoys to the castle of Bihar, to Duke Menumorout, asking him, by right of his
forbear, King Attila, to give him the land from the Szamos [Zomus] river to the border
of Nyr, up to the Meszes Gate [ad portam Mezesynam], and he sent him gifts, just as
he had previously sent to Salan, duke of Titel [duci Tytulensy].63 And in that embassy
were sent two of the most energetic warriors: Vsubuu, father of Zoloucu, and Velec,
from whose progeny Turda, the bishop, is descended. For these were the most noble
by birth, like the others that set forth from the Scythian land and who followed Duke
Álmos with a great host of peoples.
20. How they were sent against Bihar [Byhor]



25
The envoys of Duke Árpád, Vsubuu and Veluc, crossed the Tisza river at the harbour
of Lucj [in portu Lucy] and setting forth from there, coming to the castle of Bihar,
they greeted Duke Menumorout and presented to him the gifts that their duke had
sent. Then, relaying to him the message of Duke Árpád, they asked for the land which
we have named earlier. Duke Menumorout received them kindly and, enriched with
divers gifts, he ordered them homewards. Nevertheless, he so replied, saying: Say to
Árpád, duke of Hungary, your lord, that we owe him as a friend to a friend in all the
matters that he needs because a guest is a human being [homo] and lacking in much.
But the land that he seeks of our grace we will in no way surrender while we live. We
are indignant that Duke Salan has given him a very great land either out of affection,
as is said, or out of fear, as is denied. Neither from affection nor from fear will we
grant him land, even as little as he may hold in his fist, even though he says it is his
right. And his words do not disquiet our thoughts when he tells us that he is descended
from the line of King Attila, who is called the scourge of God, who seized this land
with violent grasp from my forbear, for by the grace of my lord the emperor of
Constantinople [Constantinopolitani] no one can snatch it from my hands. And having
said this, he gave them leave to withdraw. Then Vsubuu and Veluc, the envoys of
Duke Árpád, hastened speedily to their lord and, upon arrival, reported to their lord,
Duke Árpád, the message of Menumorout. Upon hearing this, Duke Árpád and his
nobles were moved by anger and they immediately ordered an army to be sent against
him. Then they decided that Tosu, father of Lelu, and Zobolsu, son of Eleud, from
whom the Saak kindred descends, and Tuhutum, father of Horka, grandfather of
Geula and Zumbor, from whom the Moglout kindred descends, should go. Taking
leave of Duke Árpád, they set forth with no small army and swam unopposed across
the Tisza at the harbour of Ladeus [in portu Ladeo]. On the second day, they began to



26
ride along the Tisza towards the Szamos river and they pitched camp at that place
where is now Zobolsu, and at that place almost all the inhabitants of the land
subordinated themselves of their own will and, throwing themselves at their feet, gave
their sons as hostages lest they should suffer any harm. For almost all the peoples
feared them and only a few managed by flight to escape them and, coming to
Menumorout, they announced what they had done. Having heard this, so great a fear
overwhelmed Menumorout that he did not dare raise his hand, because all the
inhabitants feared them more than can be said, because they had heard that Duke
Álmos, father of Árpád, was descended of the line of King Attila, on account of which
none believed they could survive except by the grace of Árpád, son of Duke Álmos,
and his noblemen, on account of which very many of their own accord submitted to
them. Well did God fulfil in Duke Álmos and his son, Árpád, the prophecy that Moses
uttered to the sons of Israel, saying: Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall
tread shall be yours.64 For the places whereon Duke Álmos and his son, Árpád,
together with their noblemen trod that day, their descendants had and have to the
present.
21. Of Zobolsu
Then Zobolsu, a most wise man, looking upon a certain place beside the Tisza, when
he saw the lie of the place, realized it to be very well placed for a castle. With the
common counsel of his companions and having assembled the men of the country
[congregatione facta civium], he built a great rampart and a most strong castle of
earth, which is now called Zobolsu castle. Then of the inhabitants of the land Zobolsu
and his companions appointed to that castle many serving men who are now called
castle-folk [servientes, qui nunc civiles vocantur],65 and having left warriors there



27
under a most noble warrior, Eculsu by name, they prepared to go further. Then
Zobolsu and his companions divided the whole army into two parts, one part to go
along the Szamos river and the other through the districts of Nir. Zobolsu and Thosu,
father of Lelu, went forth with half the army along the banks of the Tisza, conquering
peoples, and they came to that place, towards the Szamos, that is now called
Saruuar.66 And in the same place, in the marshes, Thosu, father of Lelu, having
gathered a host of people, built a great rampart and he constructed a mightily fortified
castle of earth, which was at first named Thosu castle, now called Saruuar, and having
taken the sons of those living there as hostages, they left the castle full of warriors.
Then Thosu, at the bidding of the people subjugated to his lord, Duke Árpád, had built
a market between Nir and the Tisza, to which he assigned his name, so that it is called
even now Thosu market. After Zobolsu and Thosu went forth from there, they reached
Szatmár [Zotmar] castle and besieging the castle over three days of fighting they won
victory. And on the fourth day, entering the castle, they sent those warriors of
Menumorout that they could catch there to the most foul depths of the dungeon,
bound in iron shackles, and they took the sons of those dwelling there as hostages and
left the castle full of warriors, and they began to go to the Meszes Gates.
22. Of Nyr
Tuhutum and his son, Horca, riding through the districts of Nyr, conquered a great
number of people, from the woods of Nyr up to Umusouer. And thus ascending, they
arrived at Zyloc, with none raising a hand against them, because Duke Menumorout
and his men did not dare to fight them but began to defend the Körös river. Then
Tuhutum and his son, Horca, going forth from Ziloc came to the districts of Meszes,
where Zobolsu and Thosu were, and, when they espied each other, they rejoiced with



28
great joy and, having made a feast, each one extolled himself for his victory. Next
morning, Zobolsu, Thosu and Tuhutum, taking counsel, decided that the border of the
realm of Duke Árpád should be at the Meszes Gate. Then the dwellers of the land
built at their command stone gateways and a great barricade of trees along the
boundary of the realm. Then these three aforenamed men sent through faithful
messengers word of all their deeds to Duke Árpád and his leading men. When this
was reported to Duke Árpád and his chief servants [suis yobagyonibus] they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy and made sacrifice [aldumas] in pagan manner and to those
who had brought the joyful news they gave divers gifts. Thus gladdened, Duke Árpád
and his leading men solemnly feasted for a whole week and almost every day they
were intoxicated on account of such glad news. And having heard this, Duke Árpád
and his men set forth from Szerencs [Zeremsu] and they encamped beside the Sajó
river, from the Tisza to the Honrat river.
23. Of the victory of Thosu, Zobulsu and Tuhutum
Thosu, Zobulsu and Tuhutum, when they saw that God had given them a great victory
and that almost all the nations of that land were subjugated to their lord, were then
greatly exalted over the inhabitants of that land, and when they had found a place
where no one was, they stayed there for some days while they reinforced the
boundaries of the kingdom with the strongest impediments.
24. Of the land of Transylvania [Ultrasilvana]67
And while they tarried there some while, Tuhutum, father of Horca, as he was a
shrewd man, when he learned from the inhabitants of the goodness of the land of
Transylvania, where Gelou, a certain Vlach [quidam Blacus], held sway, strove



29
through the grace of Duke Árpád, his lord, to acquire the land of Transylvania for
himself and his posterity. This was later so done, for the posterity of Tuhutum up to
the time of the holy King Stephen held the land of Transylvania and would have held
it longer, had the younger Gyla with his two sons, Biuia and Bucna, wished to be
Christians and not always opposed the holy king, as will be said in the following.68
25. Of the skilfulness of Tuhutum
The aforesaid Tuhutum, a most skilful man, sent a certain shrewd man, father of
Opaforcos Ogmand, to spy out for him the quality and fertility of the land of
Transylvania and what its inhabitants were like, so that he might, if he could, go to
war with them, for Tuhutum wished thereby to acquire a name and land for himself.
As our minstrels [ioculatores] say: They take all the places for themselves and get a
good name.69 What more? When the father of Ogmand, Tuhutum’s scout, circling like
a wolf, viewed, as much as the human gaze may, the goodness and fertility of the land
and its inhabitants, he loved it more than can be said and returned most swiftly to his
lord. When he arrived, he spoke much to his lord of the goodness of that land: that
that land was washed by the best rivers, whose names and merits he listed, that in
their sands they gathered gold and that the gold of that land was the best, and that they
mined there salt and salt crystals [sal et saligenia], and that the inhabitants of that land
were the basest of the whole world, because they were Vlachs [Blasii] and Slavs,
because they had nothing else for arms than bows and arrows and because their duke,
Geleou [sic], was inconstant and did not have around him good warriors who dared
stand against the courage of the Hungarians, because they had suffered many injuries
from the Cumans and Pechenegs [Picenatis].70



30
26. How they went against Gelu [sic]
Then Tuhutum, having heard of the goodness of that land, sent his envoys to Duke
Árpád to ask his permission to go beyond the woods [ultra silvas] to fight Duke
Gelou. Duke Árpád, having taken counsel, commended Tuhutum’s wish and he gave
him permission to go beyond the woods to fight Duke Gelou. When Tuhutum heard
this from an envoy, he readied himself with his warriors and, having left his
companions there, went forth eastwards beyond the woods against Gelou, duke of the
Vlachs. Gelou, duke of Transylvania, hearing of his arrival, gathered his army and
rode speedily towards him in order to stop him at the Meszes Gates, but Tuhutum,
crossing the wood in one day, arrived at the Almás [Almas] river. Then both armies
came upon each other, with the river lying between them. Duke Gelou planned to stop
them there with his archers.
27. Of the death of Gelu
Next morning, before daybreak, Tuhutum divided his army in two and he sent one
part a little way upstream so that, having crossed the river, they might attack while
Gelou’s warriors were still unawares. This was done. And because they had an easy
crossing, both forces arrived on the field at the same time and they fought fiercely, but
the warriors of Duke Gelou were defeated and many of them slain and more captured.
When Gelou, their duke, saw this, he fled for his life along with a few men. As he was
in flight, hastening to his castle beside the Szamos river, Tuhutum’s warriors, boldly
pursuing Duke Gelou, slew him beside the Kapus river [fluvium Copus]. Then the
inhabitants of the land, seeing the death of their lord, giving the right hand of their
own free will chose to themselves as lord Tuhutum, father of Horca, and in that place
which is called Esculeu, they confirmed their pledge with an oath and from that day



31
the place is called Esculeu, because they swore there.71 Tuhutum possessed that land
peacefully and happily from that day, but his posterity possessed it only up to the
times of the holy King Stephen. Tuhutum begat Horca, Horca begat Geula and Zubor,
Geula begat two two daughters, of whom one was called Caroldu and the other
Saroltu and Sarolt was the mother of the holy King Stephen. Zumbor begat the
younger Geula, father of Bua and Bucna, during whose time the holy King Stephen
subjugated to himself the land of Transylvania and led Geula in fetters to Hungary
and held him imprisoned for all the days of his life because he was false in faith and
refused to be a Christian and did many things against the holy King Stephen, even
though he was of the line of his mother.
28. Of Duke Menumorout
Tosu and Zobolsu, with victory won, returned to Duke Árpád, subduing the whole
people from the Szamos river to the Körös, and none dared raise a hand against them.
And Menumourut, their duke, preferred to make ready his escape to Greece than to
proceed against them. And thereafter, having set forth, they descended by a certain
river called Humusouer to the mire of Zerep. And then having set forth they reached
Szeghalom [Zeguholmu], and they wanted to cross the Körös there, in order to fight
against Menumorout, but Menumorout’s warriors came and denied them the crossing.
Then, having set forth, riding for a day, they camped beside the small mountains
[parvos montes], and riding from there along the Turu river they arrived at the Tisza,
and crossing the Tisza river at the harbour of Dorogma [Drugma], they obtained there
by the grace of Duke Árpád a great land for a certain Cuman warrior, Huhot by name,
which his descendants still have.



32
29. Of their return
As they crossed the Tisza river, they sent in advance their messengers to Duke Árpád
to announce the glad news, who, when they came to Duke Árpád, were to announce
the glad news to him that Zobolsu and Tosu [sic] had returned with their army safe
and sound and had crossed the harbour of Dorogma with all their armies. When Duke
Árpád heard that Thosu and Zobolsu had returned with all their armies safe and sound
and had crossed the Tisza river, he made a great feast and gave divers gifts to those
who had brought the glad news. Then when Thosu and Zobolsu sought to enter the
duke’s court, the duke sent in advance all his warriors to meet them and he thus
received them with great joy and, as it is the custom of good lords to prize their
faithful men, he had them eat almost every day at his table and gave them many
gifts.72 They likewise gave to Duke Árpád divers gifts and the sons of the inhabitants
handed to them as hostages.
30. Of Duke Salan
After some days had passed, having taken counsel, Árpád and his noblemen sent
envoys to Duke Salan to announce to him, as if it were good news, the victory of
Thosu and Bulsuu [recte Zobolsu] and to ask from him the land up to the Zogea river.
This was done. Etu and Voyta were sent who, when they had found Duke Salan on the
sands of Olpar, announced the glad news and claimed from him the land up to the
Zogea river. Duke Salan, having heard this, was overtaken by the greatest fear and,
moved by fear, conceded to Duke Árpád the land claimed of him up to the Zogea river
and he gave divers gifts to the envoys. On the seventh day, Etu and Vojta, having
taken leave, returned to their lord, and Duke Árpád received them honourably and,



33
having heard their report, great rejoicing was made in the duke’s court and the duke
gave to his faithful men places and large properties.
31. Of their departure from Szerencs
Next the duke and his leading men [principes] went forth from Szerencse [Zeremsu]
and they crossed the Sajó river at that place where the spring of Honrad flows, and
they camped beside the Heuyou between the Tisza and Emőd [Emeud] and stayed
there for a month. There the duke gave to Bunger [Bungernec], father of Borsu, a
great land from the Tapolca river [fluvio Topulucea] to the Sajó river, which is now
called Miskolc [Miscoucy], and gave him a castle, which is called Győr [Geuru]73,
and his son, Borsu, made that castle together with his own castle, which is called
Borsod, one county [unum comitatum].
32. Of the castle of Vrsuur and the River Eger
Afterwards, Duke Árpád and his noblemen, setting forth from there, came to the
Naragy river and they camped beside the brooks at that place which is now called
Casu, where he gave a great land to Ousadu [Ousadunec], father of Ursuur, and his
son Ursuur built a castle at the head of the river, which is now called Ursuur castle.
Thence Duke Árpád and his men, having gone forth, reached the Eger river and,
having built huts [paratis tuguriis], stayed there some days and the mountain upon
which they made a leafy shade for the duke, they called Zenuholmu and their
encampments were from the Ystoros river to the castle of Purozlou.74 Next, having set
forth, they arrived at the Zogea river and they camped along the banks of the river
from the Tisza to the wood of Matra, and they conquered all the inhabitants of the
land from the Körös [a Grisio] to the Zogeua river and to the wood of Zepus. Then



34
Duke Árpád gave a great land in the wood of Matra to Edu and Edumen [Edunec et
Edumenec], where afterwards, Pota, their nephew, built a castle, of whose line came a
long time later King Samuel, who on account of his piety was called Oba.75
33. Of the castles of Nógrád and Nyitra76
At that time, Duke Árpád, when he saw himself thus exalted and protected by his
warriors, having taken counsel of them, sent many warriors off on campaign to
conquer the people of the castle of Gömör [Gumur] and Nógrád [Nougrad] and,
should fortune favour them, then to ascend to the border of the Bohemians
[Boemorum] as far as the castle of Nyitra [Nitra]. To the warriors going on campaign,
he assigned as chief men and leaders the two sons of his uncle Hulec, Zuard and
Cadusa, and Huba, one of the leading persons.77 Then these three lords, having taken
leave of Duke Árpád, set forth from that place which is called Pásztó [Paztuh], riding
along the Hangony [Hongvn] river and they crossed the river beside the Sajó river.
And they went forth from there through the districts of Gömör castle and they reached
the mountain of Bolhád [Bulhadu] and arriving thence at the districts of Nógrád they
reached the Caliga river. Proceeding from there, they went along the bank of the
Danube and, crossing the Verőce [Wereucca] river, they camped beside the Ipoly
[Ypul] river. And because divine grace was in them, all feared them and they feared
them most greatly because they had heard that Duke Árpád, son of Duke Álmos, was
descended of the line of King Attila. Then all the Slavs, the inhabitants of the land,
who were formerly of Duke Salan, for fear of them subordinated themselves to them
of their own free will, with no one raising a hand. And so with great fear and
trembling, they served them as if they were their lords of old. Then Zuardu, Cadusa
and Huba, from whom the nimble Zemera descend, when they saw the many people



35
subjugated to them without war, made a great feast and to the higher ranking
inhabitants of the land, who had given their sons as hostages, they gave divers gifts
and they brought them with flattering words beneath the rule [sub dominium] of Duke
Árpád without war, and they took them with them on campaign. Taking their sons as
hostages, they sent them with divers gifts to Duke Árpád, on account of which the
duke and his noblemen were especially happy, and they gave many gifts to the
messengers who brought the glad news.
34. Of the Garam river and the castle of Bors78
In the mean time, Zuard and Cadusa, sons of Hulec, and Huba and their entire army
crossed the Ipoly river beside the Danube and the next day, having crossed the Garam
[Gron] river, pitched camp on the plain beside an earthen castle which is called
Uarod. And having captured that castle, they stayed there for three days, awaiting the
arrival of Borsu, son of Bumger [sic], whom Duke Árpád had sent with a great army
to support them. On the fourth day, when Borsu had come to them with a strong force,
all the inhabitants of the land feared them and none dared raise a hand against them.
Then these four lords, having taken counsel among themselves, at the bidding of those
of the inhabitants that were more faithful to them, decided that the third part of the
army should go with the inhabitants of the land to the wood of Zoulon, to make on the
border of the realm strong fortifications both of stone and wood lest at any time the
Bohemians or Poles [Boemy vel Polony] should enter their realm [in regnum eorum]
to rob and plunder. Then, by common counsel, Borsu, son of Buger [sic], was sent out
to that end with his warriors. As they rode along the Garam river, a stag in flight sped
up the tops of the mountains before them, which Borsu, pursuing most speedily, killed
on the peak of the mountains with shots of his arrows. And then Borsu, as he looked



36
round about upon those mountains, thought to build a castle there and having at once
gathered a host of castle-folk [civium],79 he built a very strong castle on the top of one
of the higher mountains, to which he have his own name, so that it is called Borsu
castle. And thence he proceeded with his armies to the wood of Zouolun and he
ordered a very great fortification to be made of stone, which is now called Borssed
Zouolvn castle.
35. Of the city of Nyitra [Nitria]
After Borsu’s departure, Zuard, Cadusa and Huba, having set forth with all their
armies from the castle that is called Warod, encamped beyond the Tursoc wood
beside the Zsitva [Sytua] river. The next day, they sent scouts, men whom they knew
to be courageous, to cross the Nyitra river to see whether they could get across to the
city of Nyitra without a battle. When they had arrived by the swiftest course at the
Turmas brook, where it flows into the brook of Nyitra [Nytre], they saw the
inhabitants of that province, Slavs and Bohemians, standing in their way supported by
the duke of the Bohemians, because after the death of King Attila, the duke of the
Bohemians had taken for himself the land which lies between the Vág [Wag] and the
Garam, from the Danube to the Morava [Moroua] river and made it one duchy
[ducatum], and at that time Zubur was made duke of Nyitra by the grace of the duke
of the Bohemians.
36. Of the scouts sent by the dukes
When those scouts who had been sent by Zuard and Cadusa, saw that the Slavs and
Bohemians were unable to withstand them, they released their arrows three times on
them and they killed some of them with shots of their arrows. When the Slavs and



37
Bohemians whom Zubur had assigned to the defence saw how those who were called
the Hetumoger used such arms, they feared greatly, because such weaponry
[armatura] had never been seen by them, and they immediately told Zubur, their lord,
and the other leaders of the province.80
37. Of the battle of the dukes of Árpád
Then Zubur, having heard this, went supported by the Bohemians to fight them with
an armed host. And when both armies arrived at the Nyitra river, Zuardu, Cadusa and
Huba wished to cross the river, but Zubur, duke of Nyitra, and his warriors fought
them for a very long time and were in no way willing to concede the crossing. And as
they fought lengthily together, the Hungarians killed many of the Bohemians and
Slavs with arrow shots, but for three days the Hungarians were in no way able to
make a crossing on account of the swell of the waters. At last, on the fourth day, the
Bohemians and all the Nyitra Slavs [Nytrienses Sclavi], seeing the courage of the
Hungarians and finding the shots of the arrows unendurable, fell to flight and to save
their lives most speedily shut themselves up in great fear in the city of Nyitra. Zuard,
Cadusa and Huba and the other warriors chased them to the city and some they killed,
some they wounded, and others they captured. Zubur, their duke, who while in flight
sought to fight them, was struck by Cadusa’s lance and, having been captured, was
put in custody; the others, shut up in the city, waited dumbstruck. The next day,
Zuard, Cadusa and Huba with an armed host of armies began bravely to storm the city
of Nyitra in many ways. And God gave them a great victory and they entered the city
fighting and the blood of many foes was shed there by them. Then they, moved by
wrath, taking Zubur, the duke of that province, whom they had captured two days
before, onto a high mountain, hanged him from a noose, whence that mountain is still



38
called Mount Zubur. And on account of that deed, all the men of that country feared
them and all the noblemen gave their sons to them as hostages and all the nations of
that land, as far as the Vág river, subordinated themselves to them. And because the
grace of God went before them, not only did they conquer them but also took all their
castles, the names of which are up until now: Stumtey, Colgoucy, Trusun, Blundus
and Bana;81 and having assigned guards to the castles they went up to the Morava
[Maroa] river, and they fixed and reinforced with obstacles the bounds of the realm of
the Hungarians as far as Borona and Saruuar and, with victory won, they returned to
Duke Árpád, and they took with them all the faithless men of that land bound with
iron fetters. And when Zuard, Cadusa and Huba came safe and sound with all their
captives to Duke Árpád, great rejoicing was made in the court of the duke. Duke
Árpád, upon the counsel and bidding of his nobles, having taken an oath from the
faithless men, gave lands in divers places to the aforesaid faithless men who had been
taken from the districts of Nyitra, lest at any time they be made yet more faithless and,
returning to their homes, do harm to those faithful to him who were living on the
border of Nyitra. And at the same celebration, Duke Árpád made Huba count of
Nyitra and of other castles, and he gave to him his own land beside the Sytuua river as
far as Tursoc wood.
38. Of the army of the Greeks and Bulgarians
In the mean time, Duke Salan, when he learnt of the might and deeds of the
Hungarians, feared lest at any time they, moved by wrath, should expel him from his
realm. Then, having taken counsel of his men, he sent his envoys to the emperor of
the Greeks and the duke of the Bulgarians to give him help in fighting Árpád, duke of
the Hungarians. The emperor of the Greeks and the duke of the Bulgarians sent a



39
great army to Duke Salan. And when they reached Duke Salan, at that place which is
called Tetel, great rejoicing was had in the court of the duke. The next day, Duke
Salan and his nobles, having taken counsel, sent envoys to Duke Árpád, saying that he
should leave their land and start homewards to his native soil. When they reached
Duke Árpád and relayed to him the message of Duke Salan, Duke Árpád and his
nobles angrily replied to Duke Salan through his envoys: The land which lies between
the Danube and Tisza, and the water of the Danube that flows from Ratisbon
[Ratispona] to Greece, we bought with our money when we were new here and we
sent as the price for it twelve white horses etcetera, as above. He, praising the
goodness of his land, sent one bag of herbs of the sands of Olpar and two bottles of
the waters of the Danube, on account of which we order your lord, Duke Salan, to
leave our land and go by the swiftest course to the land of the Bulgarians, whence his
forbear came after the death of our ancestor, King Attila. Should he do otherwise, let
him know that we will fight him at the earliest opportunity. The envoys, hearing this,
having taken leave, hurried downcast to Duke Salan. Duke Árpád and his noblemen,
having set forth with the whole army from the Zogea river encamped beside the
Tetuetlen mountain up to the Tisza, then coming along the banks of the Tisza they
reached the sand of Olpar.
39. Of the departure of Duke Salan against Duke Árpád
Duke Salan set forth from Tetel supported by the Greeks and Bulgarians and, on the
advice of his men, began with a raging mind to ride against Duke Árpád. And both
armies spent the night next to one another, but neither dared rest that whole night but
they spent the night holding their saddled horses with their hands. Next morning,
before daybreak, both sides prepared for battle. Duke Árpád, whose helper was the



40
Lord of All, dressed for war and with his battle-line ordered, besought God tearfully,
and said to comfort his warriors: O Scythians, who by the arrogance of the Bulgarians
are called Hungarians [Hungarii] after the castle of Ung [Hungu], do not for fear of
the Greeks forget your swords and lose your good name. Let us then fight strongly
and valiantly against the Greeks and Bulgarians who are as our women and let us thus
fear the host of the Greeks as a host of women. Having heard this, his warriors were
much comforted, and at once Lelu, son of Tosu, sounded a trumpet and Bulsuu, son of
Bogar [sic], with standard raised, began at the front of the army to close with the
Greeks.82 The armies of the two foes joined in battle and they began to fight each
other fiercely and, when the whole army of Duke Árpád entered the fighting against
the Greeks, very many Greeks and Bulgarians were slain. The aforesaid Duke Salan,
when he saw his men weakening in battle, took to flight and hastened for safety to
Nándorfehérvár [Albam Bulgarie].83 The Greeks and Bulgarians, struck by fear of the
Hungarians, forgot which way they had come and, turning to flight, sought to save
their lives by swimming across the Tisza, thinking it a little river, but such fear and
fright overcame them that for fear of the Hungarians nearly all were killed in the Tisza
river, so that barely any remained to give the bad news to the emperor. And that place
where the Greeks were killed is to this day now called the harbour of the Greeks
[portus Grecorum].
40 Of the victory of Duke Árpád
With victory won, Duke Árpád and his warriors went forth from there to the pool that
is called Curtueltou, and they stayed there beside the wood of Gemelsen for 34 days
and in that place the duke and his noblemen ordered all the legal customs of the realm
and all its laws,84 how they should serve the duke and his leading men and how they



41
should judge any crime done. There the duke gave to his noblemen who had come
with him divers places with all their inhabitants, and the place where all these matters
were ordered the Hungarians called according to their language Scerii, because here
was ordered the whole business of the realm.85 And the duke gave that place to Oundu
[Oundunec], father of Ete, from the Tisza to the pool of Botua and from Curtueltou to
the sand of Olpar. Some time later, Ethe, son of Oundu, having gathered a host of
Slavs, had built between Olpar castle and Beuldu harbour a very strong earthen castle
that the Slavs in their language called Csongrád [Surungrad], which means the black
castle.
41. Of the departure of Árpád
Afterwards, Duke Árpád and his noblemen, having set forth from there, reached Titul
[sic], subjugating the people. Then, having set forth, they reached the harbour of
Slankamen [Zoloncaman] and they put the whole people living between the Tisza and
the Danube under their yoke. Setting forth from there they reached the districts of
Bodrog [Budrug] and they encamped beside the Vajas [Uoyos] river and in those
districts the duke gave a great land with all its inhabitants to Tosu [Tosunec], father of
Lelu, together with his uncle, Culpun, father of Botond. Then Duke Árpád and his
leading men, having taken counsel, decided that they should send over the Danube to
Nándorfehérvár an army after Duke Salan, and as the army’s chief men and leaders
were appointed Lelu, son of Tosu, Bulsuu, son of Bogat, and Botond, son of Culpun.
They, having taken leave of Duke Árpád, rode unopposed across the Danube at that
place where the Zoua river flows into the Danube, and, setting forth from there, they
began to ride against the city of Nándorfehérvár. Then the duke of the Bulgarians, a
blood relation [consanguineus] of Duke Salan, went with a great army to fight against



42
them with the Greeks in support. The next day, both armies were arranged on the
plain beside the bank of the Danube. Lelu, having raised a standard as his sign and
Bulsuu, son Bogat, sounding the trumpets of war, began immediately to fight. The
forces of the two foes engaged one another and they began to fight fiercely and very
many Greeks and Bulgarians were slain and some of them captured. Seeing his men
thus weakening in battle, the duke of Bulgaria fleeing for his life entered the city of
Nándorfehérvár. Then, with victory won, Lelu, Bolsuu and Botond encamped a little
lower beside the Danube, and all the captured Bulgarians and Greeks were led before
them, whom they sent bound with iron to Duke Árpád in Hungary.
42. Of the messengers of the duke of Bulgaria
The next day, the duke of Bulgaria sent his messengers with divers gifts to Lelu,
Bulsu and Bontond [sic], and begging them incline to peace, gave out that he would
no longer adhere to the side of his uncle, Duke Salan, but having been defeated would
faithfully serve Árpád, duke of Hungary, and pay a yearly tribute. They, inclining to
peace and taking in pledge the duke’s own son, left with many good things of
Bulgaria and released the duke unharmed. Then, having set forth, they went to the
Gate of Wazil,86 and setting forth from there they subjugated the land of Rác [Racy]87
and having captured its duke held him for a long time bound with iron. Setting forth
from there, they arrived at the sea and they subjugated by force and persuasion
[potenter et pacifice]88 all the nations of that land to the rule [dominatui] of Árpád,
duke of the Hungarians, and they took the city of Spalato [Spaletensem] and
conquered all Croatia [Crouatiam] and, setting forth from there, they took the sons of
the nobles as hostages and returned to Hungary to Duke Árpád. Of their wars and
brave deeds, if you do not wish to read the present pages of writing, then you may



43
believe the gabbling rhymes of minstrels and the spurious tales of countryfolk who
have not forgotten the brave deeds and wars of the Hungarians even to this day. Some
say that they reached Constantinople and that Botond cut the Golden Gate of
Constantinople with his axe. But as I have found this in no book written by historians,
and have heard it only in the spurious tales of countryfolk, I do not propose so to write
in the present work.
43. Of the castles of Zagreb, Pozsega and Valkó89
Bulsuu, Lelu and Botond, setting forth from here, descended through the wood that is
called Peturgoz and encamped beside the river of Kulpa [Culpe], and having crossed
that river they arrived at the Zoua river and, having crossed the Zoua, they took
Zagreb [Zabrag] castle and, riding from there, they took Pozsega [Posaga] and Valkó
[Vlcou], and setting out from there, crossing the Danube at the harbour of the Greek
[in portu Greci]90 they arrived at the court of Duke Árpád. When Lelu, Bulsu and
Botond and the other warriors had returned to Duke Árpád safe and sound with a great
victory in the second year, great joy was made throughout the duke’s whole court and
they had a great feast and the Hungarians banqueted magnificently together with
various nations. And the neighbouring nations, hearing of their deeds, flocked to Duke
Árpád and, as truly faithful subjects, they served him with great diligence and very
many guests [hospites] were made members of his household [domestici].
44. Of the island of the Danube
After this, Duke Árpád set forth from those parts where now Bodrog [Budrug] castle
is, and he descended along the Danube to the great island.91 And they encamped
beside the island and Duke Árpád and his noblemen entering the island, having seen



44
the fertility and richness of the place and the protection given by the waters of the
Danube, loved that place more than can be said, and they decided that the island
should be ducal [ducalis] and each of the noble persons92 should have there a court
and village. Forthwith, Duke Árpád ordered the assembled craftsmen to make fine
ducal homes and he ordered all his horses, exhausted by long days, brought there to
graze and he appointed as master of his grooms a certain Cuman, a most skilled man
called Sepel and, as Sepel, master of the grooms, remained there, that island is called
to the present day by the name of Csepel [Sepel]. Duke Árpád and his noblemen
stayed there with their servants and serving women peacefully and powerfully
[pacifice et potenter] from the month of April to the month of October and, leaving
their wives there, they decided by common counsel, to leave the island in order to go
beyond the Danube and subjugate the land of Pannonia and make war against the
Carinthians [Carinthinios] and prepare to go to the march of Lombardy [in marciam
Lambardie] and, before doing that, to send an army against Duke Glad, who had rule
[dominium] from the Maros river to Haram [Horom] castle, of whose line a long time
later was descended Ajtony [Ohtum], whom Csanád [Sunad] killed. To this end,
Zuardu, Cadusa and Boyta were sent who, having taken leave, rode out and crossed
the Tisza at Kanizsa [Kenesna] and made a descent along the Seztureg river. And no
enemy appeared before them who dared raise his hand against them, because fear of
them took hold of all the men of that land. Setting out from there, they reached the
districts of Beguey and stayed there two weeks while they conquered all the
inhabitants of that land from the Maros to the Temes river and they received their sons
as hostages. Then, moving the army on, they came to the Temes river and encamped
beside the Ford of Sands [Vadum Arenarum], and when they sought to cross the
Temes’s flow, there came to oppose them Glad, of whose line Ajtony [Othum]



45
descended, the duke of that country, with a great army of horsemen and foot soldiers,
supported by Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs. The next day, because, with the Temes
river lying between them, neither army was at all able to cross over to the other,
Zuardu enjoined his brother, Cadusa, to go lower down with half his army and try to
cross in any way in order to fight the enemy. Forthwith Cadusa, obeying his brother’s
commands, riding with half the army, went very swiftly lower down and, as if God’s
grace was before them, he had an easy crossing. And when one part of the army of the
Hungarians was with Cadusa on the far side and the other half with Zuard on this side,
the Hungarians sounded their trumpets of war and, crossing the river, began to fight
fiercely. And because God with His grace went before the Hungarians, he gave them a
great victory and their enemies fell before them as hay before reapers [sicut manipuli
post messores]. And in that battle two dukes of the Cumans and three princes [kenezy]
of the Bulgarians were slain, and Glad, their duke, escaped in flight but all his army,
melting like wax before flame, was destroyed at the point of the sword. Then Zuard,
Cadusa and Boyta, having won victory, setting forth from there, came to the borders
of the Bulgarians and encamped beside the Ponoucea river. Duke Glad, having fled,
as we said above, for fear of the Hungarians, entered Keve [Keuee] castle and, on the
third day, Zuardu, Cadusa and Boyta, from whom the Brucsa kindred descends,
having arranged their army began to fight against Keve castle. When Glad, their duke,
saw this, he sent to seek peace with them and of his own will delivered up the castle
with divers gifts. Going from there, they took Orsova [Ursoua] castle and for a whole
month lived there. And they sent Boyta with a third of the army and the sons of the
inhabitants placed as hostages back to Duke Árpád and sent, moreover, their envoys
to him so that he might give them leave to go to Greece [in Greciam] that they might
conquer the whole of Macedonia [Macedoniam] from the Danube to the Black Sea



46
[Nigrum Mare]. For the mind of the Hungarians at that time chose nothing other than
to seize lands, conquer nations and practise the work of war. For at that time the
Hungarians rejoiced like the horseleech [sanguisuga]93 at the shedding of human
blood and, had they not done so, they would not have left so many good lands to their
descendants. What more? Boyta and their envoys reached Duke Árpád and they
announced to him what had happened. The duke congratulated their work and gave
Zuard and Cadusa free leave to go to Greece and occupy land for themselves, and he
gave Boyta for his most faithful service a great land beside the Tisza by the name of
Torhus. Then the envoys of Zuard and his brother, Cadusa, having received leave,
returned joyfully to their lords.
45. Of the countrymen [civibus] of the Bulgarians and Macedonians
Some days later, Zuard and Cadusa with their whole army, emblazoned standards
aloft, crossed the water of the Danube and captured Barancs [Borons] castle, after
which they went to the castle of Scereducy.94 Hearing this, the countrymen of the
Bulgarians and Macedonians feared greatly before them. Then all the inhabitants of
that land sent their envoys with many gifts to surrender the land to them and hand
over their sons as hostages. Zuard and Cadusa, inclining to peace and taking their gifts
and hostages, left them in peace, as if they were their own people, and riding beyond
the Wacil Gate [ultra portam Wacil], they took the castle of King Philip, then they
conquered the whole land up to the city of Cleopatra [ad Cleopatram civitatem],95 and
they had in their power the whole land from the city of Durazzo [Durasu] to the land
of Rác [ad terram Rachy]. And Zuardu took to himself a wife in that land and the
people, who are now called Sobamogera, remained after Duke Zuard’s death in



47
Greece and they were thus called soba by the Greeks, that is stupid people, because
with their lord dead they did not take the way home.96
46. Of the harbour of Moger
Some days later, Duke Árpád and all his leading men, going forth from the island by
common counsel, with equal consent and freely willing, encamped beyond Soroksár
[Surcusar] as far as the Rákos [Racus] river. And when they saw that they were
everywhere safe and that no one was able to stop them, they crossed the Danube and
the harbour where they made the crossing they called the Moger harbour because the
seven leading persons, who are called the Hetumoger, sailed across the Danube there.
Having crossed the Danube, they encamped beside the Danube as far as Felhéviz
[Aquas Calidas Superiores]. And hearing this, all the Romans [Romani] living
throughout the land of Pannonia, saved themselves by fleeing. Next day, Duke Árpád
and all his leading men with all the warriors of Hungary entered the city of King
Attila and they saw all the royal palaces, some ruined to the foundations, others not,
and they admired beyond measure the stone buildings and were happier than can be
told that they had deservedly taken without fighting the city of King Attila, of whose
line Duke Árpád descended, and they banqueted every day with great joy in the palace
of King Attila, sitting alongside one another, and they had before them all the
melodies and sweet sounds of zithers and pipes along with all the songs of minstrels.
Dishes and drinks were borne to the duke and his noblemen in golden vessels, to the
serving men [servientibus]97 and countryfolk in silver vessels, because all the good
things of the other neighbouring realms God had put in their hands, and they lived
lavishly and magnificently with all the guests [hospites] that came to them. And to the
guests staying with them, Duke Árpád gave great lands and properties and, when they



48
heard this, many guests thronged to him and gladly stayed with him. Then, on account
of their happiness, Duke Árpád and his men stayed in the city of King Attila for
twenty days and in the presence of the duke all the warriors of Hungary daily made a
very great tournament [turnamentum], mounted on destriers [dextrarios] with shields
and lances, and the other young men played in pagan manner with bows and arrows,
on account of which Duke Árpád was made most happy and he gave to all his
warriors divers gifts both of gold and silver along with other properties, and in that
place he gave to Cundu [Cundunec], father of Curzan, land from the city of King
Attila up to the Hundred Tumuli [ad Centum Montes]98 and to Gyoyg,99 and to his son
he gave a castle to defend his people. Then Curzan ordered that castle to be called by
his own name, and even today that name has not been forgotten.100
47. Of the land of Pannonia
On the twenty-first day, Duke Árpád, having taken counsel, set out from Etzelburg to
conquer the land of Pannonia as far as the Drava [Droua] river, and on the first day he
encamped beside the Danube towards the Hundred Tumuli. Then it was arranged that
the duke should send one part of his army along the Danube to Baranya [Borona]
castle, for which he appointed as the chief men and leaders two of the principal
persons,101 namely Ete, father of Eudu, and Boyta, from whom the Brugsa kindred is
descended, to whom for their most faithful service Duke Árpád gave no small gifts,
and to Eudu [Eudunec], son of Ete, he gave land beside the Danube along with
innumerable people. And there Eudu, having conquered the people of that district,
built a castle that is commonly called Zecuseu, because it was for them a seat and
station.102 And to Boyta he gave in the same way a great land towards Saru with
innumerable people, which is still called Boyta.



49
48. Of Veszprém [Bezprem] city
In the second part of the army was sent Vsubu, father of Zolocu and Eusee, who
sallied against Veszprém city and conquered all the inhabitants of the land up to the
Iron Castle [Castrum Ferreum].103 Then Usubu, the chief man and leader of that army,
with leave of the duke, set forth with standard aloft and encamped beside Pacoztu
mountain. Riding from there, they encamped on the field of Peytu and stayed there for
three days, and on the fourth reached Veszprém castle. Then Usubu and Eusee, having
ordered their army against the Roman warriors who guarded Veszprém castle, began
to fight fiercely. And they fought for a week. On the fourth day of the second week,
when both armies were quite exhausted by the labour of war, Usubuu and Eusuu slew
some warriors of the Romans at the point of the sword and killed others with arrow
shots. The rest of the Romans, seeing the courage of the Hungarians, having quit the
castle fled and, to save their lives, hurried to the land of the Germans
[Theotonicorum], with Usubuu and Eusee pursuing them as far as the border of the
Germans. One day, when the Hungarians and Romans were on the border, the
Romans secretly swam across the river which is on the border between Pannonia and
the Germans, on account of which it is called Loponsu by the Hungarians, because for
fear of the Hungarians the Romans secretly swam across.104
49. Of the Iron Castle
Returning from there, Usubuu, father of Zolouncu, and Eusee, son of Urcun, took the
Iron Castle and received the sons of the inhabitants as hostages. Riding from there
along the Bolotun river,105 they reached Tihany [Thyon] and having conquered the
peoples entered Veszprém castle on the fourteenth day. Then Usubuu and Eusee,



50
having taken counsel, sent to Duke Árpád their messengers with divers gifts and the
sons of the inhabitants that had been placed as hostages, to tell what kind of victory
God had given them and how the Romans, having left Veszprém castle, had secretly
swum before them in flight across the Loponsu river. Their messengers found Duke
Árpád walking about like Harpalyce [arpalice] in Turobag wood,106 and greeted him
with divers gifts on behalf of Usubuu and Eusee and they presented to the duke the
sons of the inhabitants placed as hostages. Having heard this, Duke Árpád was
especially happy and returning again to Etzelburg made a great feast and gave great
gifts to the messengers who had reported the glad news.
50. Of the destruction of Pannonia
Then Duke Árpád and his noblemen leaving Etzelburg with a third of his army
encamped beside the field of the Spring of Salt [Putei Salsi]107 and riding from there
they arrived at Bodoctu mountain. On the eastern side, Duke Árpád gave to Eleudu
[Eleudunec], father of Zobolsu, a great wood that is now called Uertus on account of
the shields of the Germans that were left there.108 At the bottom of that wood, beside
the pool of Ferteu, Sac,109 nephew of Zobolsu, built a long time later a castle. What
more? Thus proceeding, Duke Árpád and his warriors encamped beside St Martin’s
mountain, and they and their beasts drank of the spring of Sabaria, and having seen
the beauty of the land of Pannonia they became exceedingly happy. And from there
they went forth to Raba and Rabucea, and laid waste the peoples and realms of the
Slavs and Pannonians [Pannoniorum] and occupied their territories. And with frequent
assaults they stormed the boundaries of the Carinthians of the Mura [Carinthinorum
Moroanensium], of whom they killed many thousands at the point of the sword,
captured their defences and took their territories and, with God’s help, their posterity



51
keeps it to this present day by force and persuasion [potenter et pacifice]. Then
Usubuu and Eusee, father of Urcun, and their army returned safe and sound with a
great victory to Duke Árpád. For God, Whose mercy went before them, gave over to
Duke Árpád and his warriors their enemies and, by His hands, they reaped the fruits
of other peoples’ toils.110 When they were settled and conquered almost all the
neighbouring realms, they returned to the wood beside the Danube to hunt and, having
sent their warriors home, the duke and his noblemen stayed there in that wood for ten
days, and going from there, they descended to the city of King Attila and to Csepel
island, where the duchess and the other womenfolk of the noblemen were.
And that year, Duke Árpád sired a son, by the name of Zulta, and great joy
was made among the Hungarians, and for very many days the duke and his noblemen
held great banquets, and their young men frolicked before the duke and his noblemen
like the lambs of ewes before rams. Several days later, Duke Árpád and his noblemen
sent by common counsel an army against Menumorout, duke of Bihar, of which army
Usubuu and Velec were appointed the chief men and leaders. They, having set forth
from the island, riding through the sand and flow of the Tisza, crossed at the harbour
of Beuldu, and, riding on, they encamped beside the Kórógy [Couroug] river, and all
the Szekels [Siculi], who were previously the peoples of King Attila, having heard of
Usubuu’s fame, came to make peace and of their own will gave their sons as hostages
along with divers gifts and they undertook to fight in the vanguard of Usubuu’s army,
and they forthwith sent the sons of the Szekels to Duke Árpád, and, together with the
Szekels before them, began to ride against Menumorout. And they crossed the Körös
river at Stag Mountain [Cervino Monte]111 and, riding from there, encamped beside
the Tekereu river.



52
51. Of Duke Menumorout
When Menumorout heard that Usubuu and Velec, most noble warriors of Duke
Árpád, had come against them with a strong force, with Szekels in the vanguard, he
feared more than was fitting and dared not go against them because he had heard that
Duke Árpád and his warriors were stronger in war and that the Romans had been put
to flight from Pannonia by them, that the borders of the Carinthians of the Mura had
been laid waste and many thousands of men slain at the point of the sword, the realm
of the Pannonians occupied, and their enemies put to flight before them. Then Duke
Menumorout, having left a host of warriors in Bihar castle, fleeing before them,
betook himself and his wife and daughter to the groves of Ygfon. Vsubuu and Veluc
and their entire army happily began to ride against Bihar castle and encamped beside
the Iouzas river. On the third day, having arranged their armies, they set out to make
war on the castle, and, in turn, warriors gathered from divers nations began to fight
against Usubuu and his warriors. The Szekels [Sycli] and the Hungarians killed many
men with arrow shots. Vsubuu and Velec killed 125 warriors with crossbows [per
balistas]. And they fought among themselves for twelve days and, of Vsubuu’s
warriors, twenty Hungarians and fifteen Sekels [Sjcli] were killed. On the thirteenth
day, when the Hungarians and Szekels [Sycli] had filled in the castle’s moats, and
sought to put ladders to the wall, the warriors of Duke Menumorout, seeing the
boldness of the Hungarians, began to petition the two chief men of the army for terms
and, having thrown the castle open, they came before Usubuu and Velec, beseeching
them barefoot. Putting a guard over them, Vsubuu and Velec entered Bihar castle and
found there the many goods of the warriors. When Menumorout heard this from
messengers that had taken to flight, he became very greatly afraid and sent his
messengers with divers gifts to Vsubuu and Velec and asked them to incline to peace



53
and to send their envoys to Duke Árpád to announce to him that Menumorout, who
had before haughtily with a Bulgarian heart sent word through his messengers to
Duke Árpád refusing to give him a fistful of land, was now defeated and overthrown
and did not hesitate to give, through the same messengers, his realm and his daughter
to Zulta, son of Árpád. Then Vsubuu and Veluc praised his decision and sent
messengers along with his envoys to ask their lord, Duke Árpád, for peace. The day
after the envoys had entered Csepel island and greeted Duke Árpád, they delivered
Menumorout’s message. Duke Árpád, having taken counsel of his noblemen,
approved and praised Menumorout’s announcement and, as he had already heard that
Menumorout’s daughter was the same age as his son Zultus [sic], did not refuse
Menumorout’s petition and he accepted Menumorout’s daughter as Zulta’s wife,
along with the realm promised to him, and, having sent envoys to Usubu and Ueluc
[sic], he instructed that, once the wedding had been performed, they should accept the
daughter of Menumorout as wife to his son, Zulta, take with them the sons of the
inhabitants placed as hostages, and give Bihar castle to Duke Menumorout.
52. Of Usubuu and Veluc
Usubuu and Veluc and the whole army, following the orders of their lord, received the
daughter of Menumorout and the wedding was performed; and they took with them
the sons of the inhabitants placed as hostages and left Menumorout himself in Bihar
castle. Then Usubuu and Ueluc returned with great honour and joy to Duke Árpád,
and the duke and his chief servants [yobagyones] went forth to meet them and they
led the daughter of Menumorout to the duke’s home with honour, as befitted the bride
of so great a duke. Duke Árpád and all his leading men made great feasts to celebrate
the wedding and almost every day they ate as at a wedding with divers warriors of the



54
realms around, and their young men frolicked before the duke and his noblemen.
Duke Árpád, having taken an oath of the leading men and warriors of Hungary, had
his son, Duke Zulta, elevated to office with great honour. Then the duke gave for his
most faithful service to Usubu [Usubunec], father of Zoloucu, the castle of Veszprém
together with all its appurtenances and to Veluc [Veluquio] he gave the county of
Zarand and he likewise gave to the other noblemen honours and places. The second
year after all this, Menumorout died without a son and left his whole kingdom in
peace to Zolta, his son-in-law. After this, in the 907th year of Our Lord’s birth, Árpád
left this world and was buried with honour at the head of a small river that flows
through a stone culvert to the city of King Attila where, after the conversion of the
Hungarians, was built the church that is called Alba, to the honour of the Blessed
Virgin Mary.112
53. Of the succession of Duke Zulta
And his son Zulta succeeded him, who was similar to his father in character but
dissimilar in appearance.113 Duke Zulta was a little lisping and pale, with soft, blond
hair, of middling stature, a warlike duke, brave in spirit, but merciful to his subjects,
sweet of speech, but covetous of power, whom all the leading men and warriors of
Hungary loved marvellously. Some time later, when Zulta was thirteen, all the leading
men of the realm by their common counsel and of their equal wish appointed rectors
of the kingdom beneath the duke to mend through the guidance of the law of custom
[moderamine iuris consuetudinis] the quarrels and disputes of those who were in
disagreement.114 They appointed others as leaders of the army to lay waste various
realms, whose names were these: Lelu, son of Tosu, Bulsuu, a bloodthirsty man, the
son of Bogat, and Bonton [recte Botond], the son of Culpun. These were warlike men,



55
brave in spirit, whose concern was none other than to conquer peoples for their lord
and lay waste the realms of others. With leave of Duke Zulta, they destroyed a
Carinthian army and came by Friuli [Forum Iulii] to the march of Lombardy where
they brutally sacked the city of Padua with slaughter, fire, the sword and great
plundering. Thence, 115 entering Lombardy, they did many bad things. When the
inhabitants of the land, massed in a single army, sought to stand against their violence
and monstrous fury, an innumerable host of the Lombards were felled by arrow shots
and many bishops and counts were butchered. Then, having heard this, Liutward
[Lutuardus], bishop of the church of Vercelli [Uercelensis], a man of the greatest
renown, most dear friend and most faithful privy counsellor of Charles the Lesser, the
former emperor,116 taking with him his riches and matchless treasures which were
more plentiful than may be reckoned, endeavouring in every way to escape their
bloody savagery, came unwittingly upon the Hungarians and, being speedily captured
by them, was killed, and they seized the treasure that he brought that was beyond
human reckoning. At the same time, Stephen, the brother of Count Waldo, while
sitting at night on the privy [in secessu] above the wall of the castle to empty his
bowels, was severely wounded by the arrow shot of a Hungarian through the
chamber’s hatchway and died that night of the wound.
54. Of the laying waste of Lorraine [Lotorigie], Alamannia and France
Then they laid waste Lorraine and Germany, and they also put to flight the Eastern
Franks [Francos quoque orientales] on the border of Franconia and Bavaria, slaying
many thousands of them, and, taking all their goods, they returned to Duke Zulta in
Hungary.



56
55. Of the deaths of Lelu and Bulsuu
Five years later, during the reign of Emperor Conrad,117 Lelu, Bulsu and Botond, the
renowned and most glorious warriors of Duke Zulta of Hungary, having been
dispatched by their lord, stormed the districts of Germany and took many of their
goods. But, at last, by the despicable tricks of the Bavarians and Germans, Lelu and
Bulsuu were captured and killed, hanged from a gallows beside the Inn [Hin] river.118
Botond and the other warriors of the Hungarians, what was left of them, seeing
themselves hemmed in by the guile of the foes, bravely and manfully stood ground.
And they were not separated one from the other, but especially undertook to help each
other in need, and like wounded lions they rushed into battle with roars against their
foes and laid them low with the mightiest slaughter. And although they were defeated,
they nevertheless beat the victors in courage and valour and laid them low with the
mightiest slaughter. Happy thus the rewards of the Hungarians! Now all the safer on
account of the dangers they had passed, and the more warlike on account of the
constant mustering, excelling in men and might, they destroyed all Bavaria,
Alamannia, Saxony and the realm of Lorraine by fire and the sword, and beheaded
their dukes, Erchanger and Bertold.119 Setting forth from there, they stormed France
and Gaul [Franciam et Galliam], and, as they returned victorious from there, were
slain in a great heap by the wiles of the Saxons. Those of them that escaped went
homeward. But Duke Zulta and his chief men were not a little dismayed by the death
of Lelu and Bulsu and their other warriors, and they became enemies of the Germans
[Theutonicorum]. Then Duke Zulta and his warriors, in recompense for the injury
done to them by their foes, began to rage against them and did not dumbly refrain
from giving them their due. But, with God’s help, Duke Zolta, sired in the 931st year
of Our Lord’s birth a son, who was called Tocsun, who was handsome with big eyes



57
and with soft, black hair, and he had a mane like a lion, as you may read in the
following.
56. Of the foes of King Otto
That year, the foes of King Otto of the Germans plotted his death in a loathsome
crime. When they failed to do him any harm, they asked the Hungarians for help
because they knew that the Hungarians were insuperable in the usual hardships of war
and that God had by the scourge of His wrath [furoris sui flagella] given many realms
over to them. Then the enemies of Otto, king of the Germans, sent their messengers to
Duke Zulta, a warlike man, and having given him much gold, asked him whether they
might attack the aforesaid King Otto with Hungarian support. Duke Zulta, led by
wrath, as much for their goodwill and reward as in mourning for the death of Lelu and
Bulsuu, sent a great army against Otto, king of the Germans. He appointed as its chief
men and leaders Botund [Botundium], son of Culpun, Zobolsu, son of Eleud, and
Urcund [Ircundium], son of Euse. Having departed from Duke Zulta, they put once
more to the sword Bavaria, Alamannia, Saxony and Thuringia and, proceeding from
there, crossed the Rhine during Lent and destroyed the realm of Lorraine
[Latariensem] with bows and arrows. Savagely casting down all Gaul [Galliam], they
remorselessly entered the churches of God and plundered them. Thence they forced
their way by iron and the sword along the cliffs of Cenis [abrupta Senonensium]
through the Alimin peoples [per populos Aliminos]. Having subdued these most
warlike peoples, who were very well protected by natural locations, they crossed the
mountains of Cenis [montes Senonum] and took the city of Susa [Segusa].120 Then
going forth, they stormed the most wealthy city of Turin [Taurinam]. After they had
looked upon the flat countryside of Lombardy, they despoiled in swift moves almost



58
all Italy, which abounds and overflows with all goods. Then Botond, son of Culpun,
and Urcun, son of Euse, having vanquished all the aforesaid peoples, returned to their
own realms, delighting in happy victory. Then Otto [Hoto], king of the Germans,
placed traps along the Rhine and, attacking them with all the strength of his realm,
killed many of them. Botond, Vrcun and the rest of their forces, preferring to die in
battle than to lose a victory due them, pressed firmly against the foes and they slew in
that battle a great duke, a most renowned man, and, severely wounding others, put
them to flight, plundered them and returned from there to their own realms with a
great victory. And after Botond and Vrcun had returned joyously to the land of
Pannonia, Botond, worn out by the long travail of war, began strangely to weaken,
passed from the world and was buried by the Uereucea river. But this should be noted
by all those who wish to know, that the warriors of the Hungarians waged these and
other wars up to the times of Duke Tucsun.
57. Of the ordering of the realm121
After the return of his warriors, Duke Zulta established the borders of the realm of
Hungary on the side of the Greeks, as far as the Gate of Wacil [portam Wacil]122 and
the land of Rác; to the west as far as the sea where the city of Spalato [Spaletina] is,
and on the side of the Germans as far as the bridge of Guncil [ad pontem Guncil], and
in the same place he gave to the Ruthenes, who had come to Pannonia with his
grandfather, Duke Álmos, a castle to build, and on the same border, beyond the mire
of Moson, he gathered not a few Pechenegs [Bissenos] to live there for the defence of
his realm, lest at any time in the future the Germans, enraged by a harm done to them,
should lay waste the Hungarians’ borders. On the side of the Bohemians, he set the
border as far as the Morava river on condition that their duke should pay an annual



59
tribute to the duke of Hungary, and in the same way he put on the side of the Poles the
border at Turtur mountain, just as Borsu, son of Bunger, had done previously. And as
Duke Zulta and his warriors were putting down roots throughout Hungary, Duke Zulta
brought to his son, Tocsun,123 a wife from the land of the Cumans and, while still
alive, took oaths of his noblemen and made his son duke and ruler over the whole
realm of Hungary. And Duke Zulta, in the third year of his son’s reign, departed in the
way of all flesh from the body’s prison. Duke Tosun with all the leading men of
Hungary maintained by force and persuasion [potenter et pacifice] all the laws of
Hungary for all the days of his life, and having heard of his piety many guests of
various nations flocked to him. And from the land of Bular, there came some most
noble lords with a great host of Ishmaelites [Hismahelitarum], whose names were
Billa and Bocsu, to whom the duke granted lands in various parts of Hungary, and he
gave in perpetuity, moreover, the castle that is called Pest.124 Bylla and his brother,
Bocsu, from whom the line of Ethej [Ethey] descends, having taken counsel of the
people they had brought with them, gave two parts to the service of the aforesaid
castle and they left the third part to their descendants. At the same time, there came
from the same region a most noble warrior, Heten by name, to whom the duke gave
no small lands and other properties. Duke Thocsun bore a son, Géza [Geysam] by
name, the fifth duke of Hungary. And at that time, there came from the land of the
Pechenegs [Byssenorum] a warrior of ducal stock [de ducali progenie], whose name
was Thonuzoba, father of Vrcund, from whom the Thomoy kindred descends, to
whom Duke Thocsun gave to dwell in a land in the districts of Kemej [Kemey] as far
as the Tisza where is now the harbour of Obad. This Thonuzoba lived to the times of
the holy King Stephen, the grandson of Duke Tocsun. And when the holy King
Stephen preached the words of life and baptized the Hungarians, Thonuzoba, vain in



60
belief, refused to be a Christian, and he was buried alive with his wife at the harbour
of Obad lest by baptism he and his wife should live with Christ in eternity, but Vrcun,
his son, having been made a Christian, lives with Christ for ever.

20 It was once conjectured that the opening words of the chronicle, ‘P. dictus
magister’, should be read as ‘Praedictus magister’, the author’s name having been
given before on a folio that is now lost. The dictus construction is, however, an
entirely familiar form of intitulatio in Western Europe, where Anonymus was
educated, and may also be found in Hungary; thus from the intitulatio of a charter of
1226 ‘ego Vros dictus abbas Sancti Martini’ (A Pannonhalmi Sz. Benedek-Rend

24 The pseudo-Dares Phrygius’s account of the fall of Troy was composed c. 600 AD
and much read in the centuries following. Anonymus’s Prologue, along with the
descriptions of Álmos in ch. 4 and of Zulta in ch. 53, contain several short borrowings



64
from a version of its text. See thus Daretis Phrygii de Excidio Troiae Historia, ed. F.
Meister, Leipzig, 1873, esp. chs 12-13, pp. 14-7.
25 Literally, ‘the seven Hungarians’. Throughout the text, the seven leaders are, with
only one exception, referred to exclusively as persone.
26 ‘ex falsis fabulis rusticorum vel a garrulo cantu ioculatorum’.
27 Kézai and later chronicles have Dentia and Mogoria as two of the three parts of
Scythia.
28 Given in inverted commas in the original. See Revelation, 20, 7.
29 See here Andrew Runni Anderson, Alexander’s Gate, Gog and Magog, and the
Inclosed Nations, Cambridge, MA (Medieval Academy of America), 1932.
30 Aquae Calidae Superiores or Budafelhéviz, near Óbuda.
31 Óbuda or Etzelburg. Anonymus probably also refers here to the old Roman
amphitheatre.
32 The account of Scythia given here ultimately derives from Justinus’s Epitoma
historiarum philippicarum, 2.1 (ed. Otto Seel, Leipzig, 1935, pp. 18-9), mediated
through Regino, ad 889 (ed. Kurze, pp 131-2).
33 See below, ch. 13.
34 The author alludes here to the Latin adjective, almus, which also conveyed the
meaning of sanctus or pius.
35 The names of the seven Hetumoger chieftains are customarily rendered in
Hungarian as Álmos, Előd, Kend, Ond, Tas, Huba and Tétény. The kindreds referred
to here are most probably the Csák, Kalán, Kolsoy, Szemere and Maglód.
36 The reference here is to the annals of Regino of Prum, recte 889 AD (ed. Kurze, p.
131).



65
37 Deriving from the Turkic ätil or itil, meaning ‘river’. Most probably the Volga is
meant here, although the term may also be applied to the Danube.
38 ‘labores hominum’ – see below ch. 50: that is, they did not practise agriculture.
39 No such quotation may be attributed to Aristotle.
40 ‘tanquam crudas cucurbitas’.
41 Halychyna or Galicja, named after the city of Halych. The region currently
straddles Poland and Ukraine.
42 On the ‘shepherds of the Romans’, see Dennis Deletant, ‘Ethnos and Mythos in the
History of Transylvania: the case of the chronicler Anonymus’, in László Péter (ed.),
Historians and the History of Transylvania, Boulder and New York, 1992, pp. 67-85
(pp. 75-9).
43 The meaning of this sarcastic aside is obscure.
44 Vladimir or Volodymyr, nowadays in north-west Ukraine.
45 See above, ch 9.
46 The prefix ‘Menu’ is thus explained by the author as deriving from the Hungarian
mén, ‘a stallion’.
47 It is unlikely that Cozar conceals the name of the Khazars. Rather, the author
having just made a joke with the word for stallion, now seeks further to amuse by
calling some people after the Hungarian word for a goatherd (kozár).
48 On the duties of lordship, see also ch. 29. The story of Csanád’s defeat of Ajtony is
also given in the Legend of St Gellert. See SRH, 2, pp. 489-92.
49 Munka means ‘toil’ or ‘work’ in Hungarian.
50 Possibly Zemplén, situated to the west of Ung and Munkács.
51 See above, ch. 2.
52 Almost certainly a misspelling for Souiou, i.e. the Sajó.



66
53 We do not reproduce here Anonymus’s punning of leti (rejoicing) and leto (death).
54 Literally, ‘Ketel’s Brook’.
55 ‘Ad servitium cuius castri, tam de populo secum ducto, quam etiam a duce aquisito
duas partes condonavit.’ The meaning of this sentence is controversial. See Silagi and
Veszprémy, Die ‘Gesta Hungarorum’ des Anonymen Notars, p. 157. See also below,
ch. 57.
56 Andrew I, 1046-60.
57 The extant text includes no further reference to these events.
58 Probably Sóvár in Sáros county, now Solivar in Slovakia.
59 Note the use here of the Hungarian ‘dative’ suffix, -nec/-nek.
60 Most probably, the Tátra mountains.
61 The –d suffix then constituted a diminutive in Hungarian.
62 ‘De duce Bycoriensy’.
63 Probably Titel, on the confluence of the Danube and Tisza.
64 Deuteronomy 11, 24.
65 The text here refers to the institution of castrenses and udvornici assigned to
provision the principal forts of the kingdom. During the thirteenth century, many of
these asserted their status as servientes regis and joined the ranks of the nobility.
66 Sárvár, probably west of Szatmár-Németi; not to be confused with the Sárvár
mentioned in ch. 37, nor Sárvár in Vas county.
67 Cf above, ch. 11, where ‘Erdeuelu’ is used to denote Transylvania.
68 See below, ch 27.
69 The provenance of this quotation has not been established.
70 This chapter is curious in its terminology: Blasii instead of Blachi, and Picenati in
place of Bisseni. For one interpretation of this, see C.A. Macartney, ‘The Attila Saga,



67
the Hun Chronicle, and T’, Studies on the Early Hungarian Historical Sources, 3/2,
Budapest, 1940, pp. 212-3 (Studies on Early Hungarian and Pontic History, pp. 329
30).
71 Esculeu is probably today’s Esküllő, to the north-west of Koloszvár. Eskü is the
Hungarian for ‘oath’.
72 On the duties of lordship, see also ch. 11.
73 Diósgyőr in Borsod county.
74 The Ystoros is probably the Ostoros, a tributary of the Eger.
75 Samuel Aba, 1041-44. Oba may conceal the Turkic word for father.
76 ‘De castro Nougrad et Nitra’.
77 That is, one of the Hetumoger. See back, ch. 6.
78 ‘De fluvio Gron et castro Borsu’.
79 For cives, civiles, see back, ch 21.
80 Anonymus alludes here either to the compound bows used by the early Hungarians
and other steppe-peoples or, more probably, to the contemporary use of crossbows,
for which see ch. 51.
81 Variously identified as Sempte, Galgóc, Trencsén, Bolondóc and Bán.
82 For Bulsuu, see also Constantine Porphyrogenitus’s mid-tenth century account, De
administrando imperio, ch. 40 (ed. Gyula Moravcsik, 1949, p. 179): ‘The karchas
Boultzous is the son of the karchas Kalis, and Kalis is a proper name, but karchas is a
dignity, like gylas, which is superior to karchas’.
83 Belgrade in Serbia. We use here the historic Hungarian name for Belgrade as it
retains the association with the Bulgarians. Belgrade was in the possession of the
Byzantine empire between 1185 and 1214,
84 ‘ordinaverunt omnes consuetudinarias leges regni et omnia iura eius’



68
85 Traditionally identified with Szer/Pusztaszer in Csongrad county. ‘Szer’ retains the
meaning of ‘acquire’ or ‘obtain’, as in the construction szert teszi valamire.
86 The ‘portam Vazil’ is most probably the Claustra Sancti Basilii, more commonly
known as the Soukeis Pass or Trajan’s Gate, which lies between modern-day Sofia
and Plovdiv.
87 That is Rascia, which is now southern Serbia.
88 The phrase ‘potenter et pacifice’ is unusual and otherwise unknown in Hungarian
charters and chronicles. It may be found in Albert of Aix’s account of the First
Crusade, composed circa 1100, Historia Hierosolymitanae Expeditionis, ix, 13, as
well as in several Spanish charters. I am grateful to László Veszprémy for alerting me
to this.
89 ‘De castris Zabrag, Posaga, et Vlcou’
90 See back, ch. 39.
91 ‘descendit iuxta Danubium’; in fact, Árpád must have marched northwards, up the
Danube. The ‘great island’ is Csepel Island, in the Danube, immediately south of
Budapest.
92 ‘uniusquisque nobilium personarum’, i.e. the Hetumoger.
93 Proverbs 30, 15.
94 Borons may be identified as Barancs, Braničevo, on the Danube, east of Belgrade.
Scereduc/Scereducy is probably Serdica, modern-day Sofia.
95 While the castle of King Philip is probably Philippopolis, modern-day Plovdiv, the
identity of Cleopatra is uncertain. It is possibly a scribal error for Neopatras, modern
day Ypati.
96 This would appear to be a rendering of the Csaba legend, given also in Kézai, ch.
20-22 (pp. 69-73). See also an analogous account in Constantine Porphyrogenitus’s



69
De administrando imperio, ch. 38, which records the separation of a body of
Hungarians called the ‘Sabartoi asphaloi.’
97 For servientes, see back, ch 21.
98 Identified as Százhalombatta in Pest county where there is a graveyard with some
120 Celtic tumuli. The six-hectare site is now an archaeological park.
99 Possibly Diós, in Fejér county.
100 Reference to a ‘loci antiqui castri Kurchan vocati’ is found in a charter of 1332.
See SRH, 1, p. 95. It would appear to be in the proximity of Óbuda.
101 That is, of the Hetumoger.
102 Probably Szekcső. Anonymus plays here with the word szék, ’seat’.
103 Almost certainly Vasvár.
104 Anonymus plays here with the Hungarian lappang, ‘to do secretly’.
105 Most probably, Lake Balaton.
106 Clearly a word-play is intended between Árpád and Harpalyce, otherwise the
reference is obscure. In Virgil’s Aeneid (1. 382), Harpalyce is a huntress akin to
Diana. Possibly then the reference is to Árpád as a hunter.
107 Probably Sóskút in Fejér county.
108 Here Anonymus constructs a place-name from the Hungarian ‘vért’ meaning a
shield or harness. The story of German soldiers discarding their arms is also reported
in the main Hungarian chronicles of the fourteenth century with reference to a battle
fought in 1051. See SRH, I, pp. 350-1.
109 See back, ch 6. The reference is most probably to the Csák kindred.
110 ‘labores populorum’, see back, ch 7.
111 Possibly Szarvashalom, in Békés county.
112 Alba may be identified with Fehéregyháza, near Óbuda.

113 ‘similis patri moribus, dissimilis natura.’ We follow here the interpretation given
by Silagi and Veszprémy, Die ‘Gesta Hungarorum’ des Anonymen Notars, p. 123.
114 This description of the role of the rector is repeated by Simon de Kéza (ch. 7; SRH,
1, p. 147), suggesting a common source.
115 From here until the end of ch. 54, the text follows almost entirely verbatim Regino
of Prum and the continuator of his chronicle (ad 901, 907-10; ed. Kurze, pp. 148-9,
154).
116 Charles III, ‘the Fat’, King of Italy from 879 and Emperor from 881; he was
deposed in 887 and died in 888.
117 Conrad I, King of Germany, 911-918.
118 Cf the Annals of St Gall which record the hanging of a Hungarian king, ‘nomine
Pulszi’ following the battle of the Lechfeld in 955, and the death that year in a
separate battle of a second king, ‘nomine Lele’ (‘Annales Sangallenses Maiores’, ed.
G.H. Pertz, MGH SS, 1, 1826, p. 79).
119 Cf the Continuator of Regino, ad 909-17 (ed. Kurze, p. 155). The Swabian
brothers, Erchanger and Berthold, were in fact executed by Conrad I in 917.
120 We regard Cenis as more plausible a translation of Senonses than Sens, which
makes no sense. The ‘populos Aliminos’ have not been convincingly identified, but
the name may conceal the Latin ad and limen, thus implying their remoteness. See
Silagi and Veszprémy, Die ‘Gesta Hungarorum’ des Anonymen Notars, p. 179.
121 De constitutione regni.
122 See above, ch. 45.
123 Constantine Porphyrogenitus’s De administrando imperii (ch. 40; ed. Gy.
Moravcsik, p. 179) and Liutprand of Cremona’s Antapadosis (5. 33; ed. J. Becker, Die



71
Werke Liutprands von Cremona, 3rd edition, Hanover and Leipzig,, 1915, p. 151) give
him as ‘Taxis’.
