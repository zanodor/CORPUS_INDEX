Precession Data Analysis | Binary Research Institute
We have many arguments with supporting data that indicate we are
in a binary system, but one of the strongest is the “trend in
precession rates”.
Calculated precession rates over the last 100 years show increasing
precession rates which produce a declining precession cycle period.
There is no reason the relatively constant mass of the Sun and Moon
torquing the Earth should produce such figures. There is every
reason a binary system would – because these numbers are not
caused solely by local mass torquing – they are annual rates of our
Sunʼs path around itʼs binary in a elliptical orbit. They will increase
and decrease as the Sun speeds up and slows down as required by
elliptical orbits (according to Keplerʼs laws).
In the lunisolar model, if this trend were extended in either direction
by a few million years one could say precession was once non
existent – and in the future, the earth will wobble so fast that we will
all eventually fall off. We only know the historical geological record,
which indicates a cyclical pattern – like an orbit.
What is more logical: Is the mass of the Sun and Moon changing this
rapidly? Or is the Earth changing orientation to inertial space
reflective of a common elliptical pattern?

Binary Model – Kepler Solution
An observer on a planet in a binary system would notice a change in
orientation at a rate commensurate to the orbit period around the
common center of mass. (USNO) With minor local effects and no
eccentricity, this type of change in orientation at 50 ́ ́p/y would
equate to an orbit periodicity of 25,920 years. (1,296,000/50 =
25,920). At 54 ́ ́p/y, again with minor local effects and no
eccentricity, this type of change in orientation would equate to
24,000 years (1,296,000/54 = 24,000). In 1894, about the same time
that the great astronomer Simon Newcomb gave us a precession
formula with a constant of .000222 p/y (designed to predict changes
in the precession rate), an Indian astronomer, Sri Yukteswar,
explained that the moving equinox (precession) was a result of a
moving solar system and he gave us a binary orbit periodicity of
24,000 years, with apoapsis at 500 A.D. Thus, one scientist gave us
a strictly local dynamics model and the other a strictly non-local
dynamic SS model. Which model was more accurate over the next
100 years?
