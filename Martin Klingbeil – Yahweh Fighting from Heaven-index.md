Yahweh Fighting from Heaven: God as Warrior and as God of Heaven in the Hebrew Psalter and Ancient Near Estern Iconography
Klingbeil, Martin
Abstract: Based on a comprehensive survey of metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter, a total number of 507 occurrences are identified in which God is described by means of a metaphor. Applying modern metaphor theory, these occurrences are classified according to their main metaphor, submetaphor, metaphor type, and metaphor category. It is shown, that a proportionally small number of 17 main metaphor groups with their respective submetaphors exist which describe Yahweh in mostly anthropomorphic categories. Focusing on the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, a group of eight psalms is selected which display a recurrence of the two metaphors: Psa 18, 21, 29, 46, 65, 68, 83, and 144. Each psalm is discussed according to its transmitted text, semantic peculiarities, and literary structures, followed by short comments on the passage. It appears that the authors of the psalms under consideration used imagery familiar to them from their Syro-Palestinian background, but adapted and shaped it accordingly to their literary. Intentions in the form of an interpretatio Israelitica. The notion of Yahweh fighting as a warrior from heaven on behalf of his people encompasses the spectrum of meaning for the God of heaven and warrior metaphors in the most comprehensive way. In the iconographic part of the study, the visual sources are presented in three groups, i.e., depictions of gods or goddesses displaying warrior attributes, those with god of heaven attributes, and a group manifesting attributes which are reflective both imageries. A total number of 93 images are presented of which approximately one-third come from Syro-Palestinian archaeological sites. It is noted that the more aggressive depictions of gods. Can generally be associated with earlier time periods and are well represented in Syro-Palestine. As the most prolific source for iconographic images reflecting the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, the NeoAssyrian glyptic of the 9th-7th centuries can be established. In comparing the two bodies of evidence, it appears that the biblical authors employed metaphors reflecting motifs from ANE iconography, although it is not possible to speak of a one-to-one relationship. Rather, the reutilization and adaptation of the imagery and its ascription to Yahweh demonstrates the tendency to indicate the superiority of Yahweh over the deities of the ANE in a strong monotheistic fashion.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The present study is based on a doctoral dissertation, submitted in January 1995 as part of the requirements for a D.Litt. in Ancient Near Eastern Studies to the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. The manuscript has been updated to include current bibliographic material and downsized to fit the requirements ofthe OBO series. Although written by one author, a dissertation is never the product of an individual effort, but rather the result of a variety of influences and personalities who contributed in a direct or indirect way to the present study in its final stage (for which the author, of course, takes the ultimate responsibility). Therefore, I would like to single out a number of people to whom I would like to express my appreciation. Dr. 1. Cornelius from the University of Stellenbosch proved to be a competent promoter with an astonishing bibliographical memory who always knew of another article, monograph, or note pertaining to the issue under question. Dr. P. A. Kruger from the University of Stellenbosch served as internal examiner, and his own interest in the metaphorical language of the Bible proved tobe the right tool in assessing the present study. This dissertation would not have been possible without a visit to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland in February/March 1994. Prof. 0. Keel's kind invitation and gracious hospitality in the midst of the turmoil related to the end of the winter semester at the university were highly appreciated. Although pressed for time he always had a suggestion or an answer to my numerous questions. He not only proved himself to be the father of iconography, but also a benevolent host towards a doctoral student from South Africa. Furthermore, his willingness to function as external examiner was highly appreciated. The financial assistance of the Biblical Institute at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and also of the University of Stellenbosch for this visit is hereby acknowledged. A number of individuals have given valuable input to the outcome of this dissertation: Dr. W. Shea (Biblical Research Institute, Washington, D.C.) for his repeated encouragement; Dr. J. Doukhan (Andrews University, Michigan) for pointing out the importance ofthe warrior metaphor; Dr. Ch. Uehlinger (University of Fribourg, Switzerland) for discussing the project with me and making valuable bibliographical suggestions.

My wife, Thandi, has continuously encouraged me to prepare the manuscript for publication, and supported me not only by proof-reading my English, but also by creating a peaceful harne atmosphere that served as the tranquilizing antidote for my violent topic. In addition to that, she also displayed the artistic vein that I am missing in providing numerous line drawings for the iconographic objects. My brother, Dr. Gerald Klingbeil, completed his own doctoral dissertation at the same time as I, and the exchange of insights and frustrations over many a good supper helped to renew our motivation when it was needed. A heartfelt thanks goes also to my colleagues at the Universidad Adventista de Bolivia in Cochabamba, Bolivia, for their interest in my academic interests beyond the classroom. Having spent the past three years working as Associate Professor of Biblical Languages and Old Testament at the university, surrounded by the impressive Tunari mountain range (5035m), the theophanic event has taken on a deeper meaning, while watching the majestic thunderstorms the sweep through our Andes valley (2600m) during the summer rains.



1. INTRODUCTION
The Hebrew psalter still remains one of the most poptilar books in the Old Testament, since it represents a chronological cross-section of Hebrew religious thought without concentrating exclusively on either narrative, sapiential, or prophetic objectives. Although it has always been taken for granted that this collection of poems and hymns is rich in metaphorical language, very little has been done in the line of applying modern metaphor theory to the text of the Hebrew Bible: "Few commentators or readers of the Psalms can doubt the importance of metaphor in either the psalter itself or in religious language generally, but very few, so it seems, actually write on the subject" (Croft, 1987:53). Commonly the procedure is followed to identify the meaning of metaphors from the perspective of extra-biblical comparative material without first trying to establish the meaning of a specific metaphor within the biblical frame of reference. Although this certainly is a legitimate approach, and forms a significant part of the following study, it cannot replace the deciphering of a biblical metaphor within its own Israelite identification and dynamic cultural context (Brettler, 1993: 135f.), taking the results of modern metaphor research into consideration. 1 The metaphor of God as warrior has repeatedly invited the attention of the academic community, but predominantly from the perspective of lsraelite vs. ancient Near Eastern warfare.2 The attention normally focuses on issues such as Yahweh's intervention in lsraelite warfare, the notion of 'holy war', the various periods and stages of Israelite warfare, the theological implications of the motif, etc. The significance of the metaphor of Yahweh as warrior has been neglected to a certain extent. As a positive step in the right direction, Brettler's article (1993) about the metaphor of Yahweh as warrior in the Hebrew psalter should be noted.3 However, in a preliminary
1 An important recent survey on the status qua of metaphor research and its relationship to the biblical text, is found in Macky (1990).
2 Pertaining to the theme ofthe divine warrior and lsraelite warfare, cf. von Rad (1951), Miller (1973), Lind (1980), Weinfeld (1986), and more recently, the study by Kang (1989). The last author tries to "investigate the motifs of divine war in the ancient Near East andin this light to research the motifs ofwar in the Old Testament" (1989:1).
3 Brettler's article in which he discusses four psalms (3, 46, 83, 144) has at least in part provided a certain impetus for the present study, since he endeavours to establish the meaning of the metaphor of Yahweh as warrior within the ancient Israelite religious matrix. He takes modern metaphor theory into consideration which indicates "that a



2 1. INTRODUCTION
survey of metaphors in the Hebrew psalter we established the affinity between the warrior metaphor and the God of heaven metaphor to the extent that one may actually speak of one metaphor with two facets. Therefore, the focus of the research is on both the warrior and God of heaven imagery. Beyond the understanding of the metaphors of Yahweh as warrior and as God of heaven against their biblical background, the relationship between biblical metaphor and ANE iconography, viz., the study of visual material from the ANE, offers itself as an avenue for comparative research, since one aspect of a metaphor is its function as a literary image.4 ANE iconography has claimed a secure stand within the realm ofBiblical Studies over the last two decades, contributing to the study of the religious history of the ANE. The publications coming forth from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, have made a significant contribution in this field. 5 While the imagery of the Hebrew psalter and its relationship with ANE iconography has been the subject of the popular Die Welt der altorientalischen Bildsymbolik und das Alte Testament. Am Beispiel der Psalmen by Keel (1972),6 a discussion of the motif of Yahweh as God of heaven and warrior in the psalms, set in comparison with images from ANE iconography depicting motifs of deities with similar connotations, has thus far not been undertaken.
1.1. TERMINOLOGY
With regard to the terminology employed in this discussion, the following observations are valid: Yahweh as warrior refers to motifs that are ascribed to God in the Hebrew psalter bearing warlike connotations. The presence in the biblical texts of descriptions of hostile activities, implements of warfare, semantic domains
metaphor acts as a storehouse of associated commonplaces between the vehicle and the tenor, any of which may be evoked in particular contexts" (1993:137). While we will discuss metaphor theory at some length below, this statement demonstrates the metaphorical approach to the warrior motif. 4 Cf. e.g. Keel's study on the metaphoric language ofthe Songs ofSolomon (1984).
5 Tue recent attempt of Keel and Uehlinger (1992) to iconographically trace the development of Canaanite/Israelite religious symbolism from the Middle Bronze age to the end of the Persian period has already become a standard work. 6 Now in its 5th German edition.



1. INTRODUCTION 3
of warfare,7 etc., are indicative of the utilization of the metaphor of God as warrior. Most of these images are anthropomorphically oriented, but as Brettler correctly observes, go beyond mere projections of human warrior attributes onto Yahweh: "The many similarities between human warriors and YHWH as warrior in conjunction with the substantial differences between them make it appropriate to speak of 'YHWH is a warrior' as a metaphor" (1993:137). Yahweh as God of heaven8 is a more generic and somewhat ambiguous term which has been chosen. lt is used in a general sense in order to accommodate the various aspects of the motif of a heavenly God involved in warfare. Thus the terminology will encompass descriptions of Yahweh with cosmic or celestial connotations such as activities or attributes designating him as weather-god, sun-god, storm-god, bringer of rain and fertility, etc. To isolate one of these aspects as the main communicator of the imagery would have limited the scope considerably, and only the terminology of Yahweh as God of heaven appeared expandable enough to accommodate the various cosmic contexts in which the warrior metaphor occurs. lt is the notion of Yahweh fighting as a warrior from heaven which epitomizes the affinity of the metaphors and their spectrum of meaning in the most concise way.
1.2. ÜBJECTIVES
The study will analyze the metaphors of God as warrior and god of heaven in the Hebrew Psalter exegetically, and then compare them against the background of pictorial sources from the ANE. In a more detailed manner, the objectives of the present study can be summarized as follows: (1) To discuss the methodological issues associated with the various aspects of the research, including the following: the current state of metaphor research in the realm ofbiblical metaphors and the formulation of a metaphor theory relevant for the present discussion; a short introduction to the problem issues conceming the study of the Hebrew psalter and the choice of an exegetical approach to the biblical texts selected for this study;
7 In dealing with metaphorical language, it has to be noted that the identification of the metaphors lies on a concept level, and cannot be restricted to expressions and divine
epithets like 11:::i; 'warrior' or m:in'?o t!1'~ 'man of war' (Brettler, 1993: 138).
8 With regard to the spelling of 'God' throughout the study we have attempted to keep in line with traditional English spelling practices. In reference to the God of the biblical texts, we use capitalization, while 'god' as a designation of other deities or as a generic term will not be capitalized.

an introduction to the realm of iconographic studies and their relationship to the biblical texts; a brief discussion of the comparative approach and its ramifications. (2) To identify and select a number of texts from the Hebrew psalter which represent the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, and to attempt an understanding ofthe metaphors from an exegetical perspective. (3) To collect and describe iconographic images of goddesses, gods, or divine symbols from the ANE, displaying attributes which can be associated with the God of heaven and warrior metaphors. (4) To compare the biblical texts with the iconographic images with regard to similarities and contrasts, and to draw possible conclusions from such a comparison.



2. METHODOLOGICAL PRELIMINARIES
In view of the ever-increasing complexity of readily available information and data, the emphasis in biblical scholarship has taken a distinct turn during the last 30 years. While the 1950s and 60s were characterized by a synthetical approach to the field of biblical studies, including sweeping historical reconstructions and the sometimes astonishing integration of a variety of data into an overall picture, we nowadays are faced with discussions about methods, axioms, and criteria. The focus has shifted from far-reaching conclusions to the way by which one arrives at certain, cautiously qualified, deductions (Herion, 1992:xxxvii). In the age of paradigm shifts, epistemological questions become fundamental issues. The biblical scholar of the nineties is a highly skilled specialist with a limited and clearly defined area of expertise.1 Scholarly almanacs in the size of a William F. Albright, whose scientific contributions comprised a vast variety of disciplines, are a disappearing species.2However, the pendulum movement, which so often characterizes the progress of scientific thought, also applies to the field of biblical studies. While former generations of biblical scholars sometimes arrived at far-reaching conclusions that were acceptable to a majority of scholars,3 we nowadays are faced with the realization that "scholarly consensus simply does not exist here at the end of the twentieth century" (Herion, 1992:xxxvii). However, this
1 This development which has been at times lamented as "overspecialization", is reflected in the development of the recently published Anchor Bible Dictionary. Says Herion in his introductory remarks: "One will also appreciate the extent to which biblical studies has [sie] become increasingly specialized and even fragmented during the past thirty years. This first became apparent to us during the assignment phase of the project, as more and more contributors expressed reservations about taking on assignments that did not lie within the immediate bounds oftheir particular 'subject' or area of expertise. On the positive side, this means that most ABD entries devote greater attention to crucial niatters of data methodology, so that the reader usually gets an expert presentation of the basic issues associated with the study of this or that topic. However, ... the drawback is a certain reluctance to place a given topic within a !arger picture - to provide the sweeping and definitive synthesis that some readers desire and expect in a dictionary ofthe Bible" ( 1992:xxxviii).
2 lt is interesting to note that "in 1962 only 253 contributors were needed to write more than 7,500 entries for the /DB, while thirty years later almost four times as many were needed to write 6,200 entries for the ABD" (Herion, 1992:xxxix).
3 This is, of course, an over-simplification of the matter, but the intent is to illustrate the extreme sides ofthe pendulum movement in the development ofbiblical scholarship.



6 2. METHODOLOGICAL PRELJMINARIES
phenomenon sometimes tends to leave the biblical student in the peculiar situation of finding himself, though sufficiently supplied with "the facts", without assistance to integrate these facts into a meaningful greater picture. From the preceding remarks, it stands without question that a significant part will be devoted to methodological issues. Nevertheless, it seems important also to critically point out the possible pitfalls of the recent emphasis on methodology. Thus, some remarks to methodology. (1) Methodology in itself is not a safeguard against 'sweeping syntheses'. Often, even the methodology applied reflects the convictions of the individual scholar. lf a methodology is only adduced to serve as proof for the personal opinion of the author, then the soundness of the methodology seems tobe questionable.4 (2) A balanced approach to the relationship between methodology and synthesis appears to be essential. That would refer to the three important stages of a research project: a) the development of a sound methodology with consideration of all relevant factors; b) the consistent application of that methodology, and c) the cautious integration of the research results into a meaningful whole. The concept of the present study endeavors to follow these guidelines, while the relevant issues concem the following areas: a) concept and theory of biblical metaphor; b) exegesis of the Hebrew psalter; c) iconographic studies and their relevance for biblical studies; and d) comparative method. However, unlike other studies we shall limit our methodological considerations in this chapter to a description of the research procedure and the limitations ofthe project. We shall deviate from the common practice of presenting the methodological considerations in the form of a sometimes overwhelming section preceding the entire discussion, which often appears to be somewhat disconnected from the actual application of the methodology. Thus, at the beginning of each chapter a manageable section concemed with the methodological issues relevant for the respective chapter is included. In that way it is endeavoured to make the study more reader-friendly.
4 Obviously, the scholar does not start his work with a tabula rasa in his mind. Nevertheless, he has to be aware of his own preconceptions, and be able to adjust his opinion to the research results.



2. METHODOLOGICAL PRELIMINARIES 7
2.1. PROCEDURE
The general procedure will be outlined in the following. The research is proceding from a general survey of metaphors in the Hebrew psalter toward the specific texts and iconographic images relevant for the discussion.
2.1.1. Survey of Metaphors of God in the Psalms
In order to isolate the metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter, the results of a general survey of the texts will be presented. This list of texts/passages will be organized in categories of main metaphors with their respective associated submetaphors.5 As an organizing criteria we will adapt Brettler's concept of main metaphors and submetaphors. Furthermore, Korpel's semantic classes will be adapted to the need of the present study (cf. below under 3.1.).
2.1.2. Intemal-Exegetical Analysis
After having thus gained a profile6 of the metaphorical language about God employed in the psalms, we will select one metaphor7 with its various submetaphors, and analyze it according to its inner-biblical meaning. We follow with this procedure the valid claims made by Talmon (1977) which will be discussed below in the introduction to chapter 6.8 Tue questions involved in the exegetical process are the ones of classical exegesis: text, translation, historical and literary context, form, structure, grammar, lexical analysis, biblical context, etc. (Stuart, 1992:682-688; Deist and Burden, 1980; cf. also below in the introduction to chapter 4).
5 The identification of an associated submetaphor will be discussed below (cf. Brettler, 1989:21; Soskice, 1985:73).
6 To the best knowledge of the present writer, a survey like this has not been conducted yet. lt stands without question that the probability of missing an individual metaphor is not to be excluded, taking into consideration the amount of material and the limitations of metaphorical identification. Therefore, one has to keep in mind the outline-character ofthis procedure.
7 The criteria for the selection are not fixed, and are determined by the value of the metaphor for the rest of the study. The God of heaven and warrior metaphors, in this case, are understood as two facets ofthe same metaphor.
8 Talmon demonstrated "the need for a definition of the proper procedure to be followed in the comparative philological study of biblical texts and to adduce proof for the maxim that the inner-biblical analysis always should precede the comparison with extra-biblical texts" (1977:347).



8 2. METHODOLOGICAL PRELIMINARIES
2.1.3. External-Iconographic Analysis
Iconographic research has contributed an increasing amount of valuable insights for biblical studies obtained through the understanding of motifs found on extra-biblical artifacts. The ratio between extra-biblical literary sources and non-literary sources is far toward the advantage of the iconographic side (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:10-12). Iconography has indeed become a discipline of biblical scholarship in its own right, furthered especially by 0. Keel and his students at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.9 The subject of this study, i.e., metaphors of God, lend themselves readily to comparisons with extra-biblical iconographic sources. Therefore, iconographic sources from the ANE,10 originating within the given chronological and geographical limitations of this study, qualify as comparative material for the study of metaphors of God.11 These objects will be assembled and presented in the form of a descriptive catalogue.
2.1.4. Comparison
After having analyzed the biblical texts and the iconographic objects in their own right, both bodies of evidence will be compared with each other with regard to similarities and contrasts between the literary and iconographic imagery employed.
9 Cf. the recent publication by Keel and Uehlinger (1992) in which the authors have analyzed iconographic sources and their contribution toward the religious history of Canaan and Israel.
10 Especially depictions on miniature art such as cylinder or stamp seals (Flachbilder), i.e., two-dimensional representations, in contrast to figurines, can communicate a thematic context (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:Bf.).
11 As for the extemal-iconographic category of comparison, the approach to the comparative material will be representative, and not cornprehensive.

This chapter will incorporate an introduction to the theoretical framework of biblical metaphor, followed by a survey of metaphors of God in the book of psalms. A statistical evaluation of the material will conclude this section.
3.1. BIBLICAL METAPHOR
Theories of metaphor have been abundant, and since the time of Aristotle the discussion of the use of metaphor in language has become a preeminent topic for philosophical and scholarly discourses.1 lt is not the intention of the present study to trace the concept of metaphor to its Greek philosophical roots, but rather to provide a short survey of literature pertaining to the present state of the issue, especially with regard to the language of the Bible.2 This will be followed by a discussion of relevant aspects regarding the use of metaphor in biblical language.
3.1.1. Review of Literature
The last three decades have brought an increasing number of publications dealing with the subject of metaphor in a general sense and, in a more specific way, with biblical metaphor (Macky, 1990:1).3 The main
1 Tradition;lly Aristotle h~ bei:n credited with the first comprehensive discussion of metaphor; the focus of his ideas were on the nature of language. Tue primary source for his discourse on metaphor is found in the first sentence of chapter 21 ofthe Poetics: "A 'metaphorical term' involves the transferred use of a term that properly belongs to something eise; the transference can be from genus to species, from species to genus, from species to species, or analogical" (Aristotle apud Soskice, 1985:4). lt has to be understood, however, that Aristotle's treatment of metaphor was pragmatically oriented; he did not intend to convey "a rigorous description of linguistic practice but to describe metaphor in order to help the poet to achieve excellence in style" (Soskice, 1985:9).
2 Macky, in his valuable study on The Centrality ofMetaphors to Biblical Thought points out a general absence of literature in this area: "We have works on metaphor in general, in religion, andin Christian theology, but none on metaphor in the Bible" (1990:8).
3 The dichotomy between religious metaphorical language on one side being charged with imprecision and emotionality, and scientific language on the other presented as the epitome of objectivity and factuality, has to be abandoned right from the beginning. Soskice devotes a chapter to the question of the relationship between religious and scientific language with respect to the use of metaphors: "In science, social science, ethics, theology, indeed the whole realm of abstract theorizing, it is the paramorphic

contributions have come from the field of general linguistics, these concepts having only recently been applied to biblical studies.4 1. A. Richards' The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936), in which he differentiates between the subject - the tenor, and the symbol - the vehicle, of a metaphor, can be taken as a point of departure. This concept is taken up by M. Black in Models and Metaphors (1962) in which he introduces bis theory about the subject, describing it as the interaction-view of metaphor5 (1962:38). He acknowledges the importance of the literary context for the understanding of a metaphor, transferring the discussion to the sphere of semantics. Paul Ricoeur's The Rufe of Metaphor (1977) claims that metaphors can only be defined metaphorically, thus creating a paradox (cf. Korpel, 1990:47). G. Lakoff and M. Johnson, in Metaphors we live by (1980), contribute some new impetus in claiming that almost all language is metaphorical (1980:3). Earl R. MacCormac, in A Cognitive Theory of Metaphor (1985), describes metaphor as resulting from a cognitive process, while bis emphasis lies also in the realm of semantics, especially semantic associations as determinants for the meaning of a metaphor.6 Furthermore, he suggests that "all theories about the way metaphorical thinking works must themselves be metaphorical" (Macky, 1990:7). Shifting the focus of the discussion to the field of biblical studies, G. B. Caird devotes one chapter in The Language and Imagery of the Bible (1980) to the use of metaphor in the Bible. However, his point of convergence is very narrow, and besides stating bis hypothesis that "all, or almost all, of the language used by the Bible to refer to God is metaphor" (1980: 18), he unfortunately does not discuss the theoretical assumptions and implications of such a position. Much of the impetus for the discussion of biblical metaphor has originated in NT studies, and it is interesting to note that "in the field of biblical exegesis, interpreters of the gospel parables have been foremost in exploiting this radical re-estimate of the importance of metaphor" (Porter,
models [i.e., models where the source and the subject differ, as in a metaphor] which are used in attempts to speak about the 'mysterious overplus'" (1985:103; cf. also Brettler,
1989:17).
4 This survey of literature is not meant to be exhaustive, since it is not objective of the present study to re-write the development of the debate centering around the use of metaphorical language. 5 Tue different theories ofmetaphor, viz., biblical metaphor, will concem us below.
6 Says MacCormac: "The meaning of metaphors results from the semantical aspects of communication, the context in cultural settings, and the creation of new concepts. Like the determination of meaning in ordinary language, metaphorical meaning arises from various dimensions ofmetaphor - communication, culture, and cognition" (1985:227).

1983 :x). Only during recent years bave scbolars tumed their attention to tbe use of specific metapbors in tbe Old Testament.7 J. M. Soskice, in Metaphor and Religious Language (1985), formulated an important approacb wbicb can be referred to as a critical realist view of religious metaphors (Macky, 1990:7), stressing tbe importance of experience in the development of metapbor.8 Tbe mention of a number of recent studies will conclude tbis brief survey of literature about metapbor and its usage in biblical language. God is King (1989) by M. Z. Brettler addresses tbe metapbor of divine kingsbip. Taking a moderate approacb,9 bis main contribution may be found in tbe notion tbat metapbors bave associated submetapbors (cf. Soskice, 1985:73) wbicb indicate tbat the metapbor of God as King is alive and not dead (Brettler, 1989:21-23). Brettler bas continued to systematically trace tbe development of metapborical tbougbt in tbe Od Testament in an article on tbe warrior metapbor in tbe Psalms (1993) wbicb comes closest to tbe scope of tbe present study.10 In a recent study (1998), Brettler bas sbifted bis focus to propbetic literature, demonstrating a variety of at times conflicting metapbors in Isa 40-66 tbat serve to create a complementary image of God stressing bis incomparability.11 Anotber important contribution of Brettler is tbe idea tbat metaphors of God do not necessarily bave to be logically interrelated, but can at times complement or even criticize eacb otber, tbough witbout mutually annibilation (1998: 102f.).
P. W. Macky, in The Centrality of Metaphors to Biblical Thought (1990), bas made tbe question of biblical metapbor tbe subject of a wbole monograpb.12 Tbe value of tbat study lies in tbe consequent application of
7 E.g. Porter (1983) in a study on Daniel 7 and 8, and Keel (1984) on metaphor in the Song of Solomon.
8 Says Korpel in summarizing the main ideas of Soskice: "She states that in science as weil as religion, experience is at the root of all knowledge. Although the individual experience remains vital, it is the collective experience as codified in an established tradition of interpretation by a particular community of interest that is decisive. To understand a religious metaphor one has to stand in that particular context and tradition" ( l 990:25f.).
9 Says Brettler: "I agree with Black, Ricoeur and others, that metaphor must be studied within both semantics and pragmatics..." (1989:20). See also below.
1° Cf. our remarks in the introduction. See also his contribution to a project at the University of Duisburg (Brettler, 1997) that tries to metaphorically map God in the Hebrew Bible.
11 "I would suggest that these divine similes and metaphors which are central to Isaiah 4066 are used to suggest YHWH's fundamental likeness to humans while still fostering YHWH's incomparability" (Brettler, 1998:98).
12 Macky reviews the developments up to the publication ofhis study (chapter 1), followed by a definition of metaphor (chapter 2) which is in accordance with Soskice [see below

theoretical considerations about metaphor to the biblical text. His approach to the subject, which he labels critical metaphoricalism, seems to be balanced, avoiding the pitfalls of the more extreme positions.13
M. C. A. Korpel's A Rift in the Clouds. Ugaritic and Hebrew Descriptions of the Divine (1990) has made an important contribution to the question of biblical metaphor from the perspective of Ugaritic literature. In content and character this work comes closest to the scope of the present study.14 The value of this work is significant, since it provides a wealth of information about the extra-biblical background of metaphors relating to God employed by the biblical authors, and it can almost be used as a reference work. Korpel, like Macky, also seems to take an intermediate approach to the theory of metaphor (Korpel, 1990:77). To conclude this section, a statement of Brettler may be taken as representative for the present trend of thought in studies dealing with biblical metaphor. Theorists of metaphor may be divided into three camps: those who posit that metaphor is determined by semantics,15 the study of words; those who define metaphor through pragmatics,16 the study of utterances; and those who take an intermediate position, that metaphor belongs to both disciplines. A scholarly consensus is slowly being reached that the third, compromise position is correct (1989:19)
under 3.2.2.]. He then describes the various types of biblical metaphor (chapter 3), proposing a metaphorical model for biblical metaphor (chapter 4). After having addressed the issue of retired metaphors (chapter 5), he tums to the discussion of the most prominent theories of metaphor (chapter 6 and 7). Next he tums to the question of what language the biblical writers employed for God (chapter 8), after which he discusses the purpose and necessity of metaphorical usage in the Bible (chapter 7-10). The concluding chapter ofthe book tries to communicate imaginatively to the reader the experience of a biblical writing in bis application of a metaphor. 13 See below under 3.2.2.
14 In order to avoid being repetitious we will present the summary of Korpel's book as provided by Niehr in a book review: "In einem einleitenden Kapitel arbeitet die Verfasserin die Problemstellung ihrer Arbeit anhand von Theologen des Mittelalters bis zur Modeme heraus.... Anschließend wendet sie sich der Analyse von Metapher und Ähnlichkeit zu.... In Kap. 3 wird eine Fülle von anthropomorphen Metaphern in der Beschreibung des Göttlichen in Ugarit und Israel untersucht. ... Kapitel 4 stellt die theriomorphen ... Beschreibungen des Göttlichen dar. Die Arbeit wird beschlossen durch Schlußfolgerungen..." (1992:461f.).
15 E.g. A. J. Bj0rndalen in bis Untersuchung zur allegorischen Rede der Propheten Amos und Jesaja (1986) follows A. J. B. N. Reichling's Verzamelde studies over hedendaagse problemen der taalwetenschap (1966): "Die Metapher wird von A. Reichling im Rahmen einer allgemeinen Theorie der Wortbedeutung beschrieben" (Bj0mdalen, 1986:39).
16 As a representative of this group, J. Searle may be taken: "Metaphorical meaning is always speaker's utterance meaning" (1979:93).

3.1.2. Theories of Biblical Metaphor
The foregoing brief survey of the literature about metaphor in general and biblical metaphor in particular has made it apparent that the classical definition of metaphor does not suffice for the purpose of the present study. Before we turn our attention to the various theories of biblical metaphor, it seems appropriate, therefore, to find a working definition of metaphor. Metaphor belongs to the category of figurative language17 and the attempts to define such an universal linguistic phenomenon are almost as numerous as the authors who address the question.18 A definition of metaphor must include both semantics and pragmatics, recognizing the fact that the nature of metaphor depends largely on the "verbal cotext and situational context" (Korpel, 1990:77). Furthermore, metaphor should be defined as a cognitive act initialized by a figure of speech. Macky's definition of metaphor appears to include all the above-mentioned aspects:
Metaphor is that figurative way ofspeaking (and meaning) in which one reality, the Subject, is depicted in terms that are more commonly associated with a different reality, the Symbol, which is related to it by Analogy [his italics] (1990:49). 19
In order to avoid the somewhat ambiguous term symbol, one could replace it with representation which points to the reality standing behind it and the cognitive process which is involved in the recognition of the metaphor. Thus a working definition of biblical metaphor for the purpose of this study could be formulated as follows: Metaphor is a deliberate form of figurative speech that works on both word and sentence level. Metaphor as an act of speech leads to a cognitive act aided by associative commonplaces which is evoked by the incongruence20
17 Trying to define the fine line between literal and figurative language, Macky comes to the following conclusion: "Therefore the major distinction we offer is that literal usage is (communicable) independent usage and figurative usage is dependent usage [his italics]" (1990:42). Figurative language according to this definition is dependent on another point of reference than the immediate reality to which literal language can be applied. However, it is important to acknowledge the complex and sometimes subjective character of the differentiation between literal and figurative language use. Comments Nielsen: "And, finally, it should be stressed that, since it is very largely a matter of opinion whether a specific expression is perceived as imagery or literal language, it is important to investigate how the expression relates to any literal language in the associated literary context" (1989:67). 18 Fora summary ofthe most significant definitions, see Macky (1990:44-49).
19 Macky defines symbol and analogy as follows: "Analogy: a relationship between two realities in which there are significant similarities and noticeable differences.... Symbol: a reality (an object, quality, process, state of affairs or image) that stands for and gives insight into some other reality because ofthe analogy between the two" (1990:56).
20 With incongruence we refer to the fact that there are biblical metaphors which are false when taken literally - which is the normal case - but that there are also metaphors which



14 3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS
between the way a reality is depicted (i.e., the representation) and the customary depiction of that reality (i.e., the subject).21 A short comment is appropriate at this juncture about the relationship between metaphor and imagery. lt is interesting to note that both terms are often used interchangeably and tend to be conflated (Nielsen, 1989:61f.). For this study we understand imagery as a category broader than metaphor, including other categories of figurative language, e.g., comparison, parables and allegories.22 Metaphor could therefore be viewed as a category of imagery.
3.1. 2.1. Substitution Theory ofMetaphor
This theory comes closest to the original definition of metaphor postulated by Aristotle and has been reiterated repeatedly, finding its way into studies on metaphor which have originated in the twentieth century. The substitution theory of metaphor, which can also be designated as absolute literalism, is based on the assumption that a metaphor which has any cognitive meaning can adequately or more precisely be re-expressed in Iiteral speech. Therefore, the metaphor functions only as a substitution for a Iiteral expression (Macky, 1990: 139). One has to realize the theoretical paradigm of the nature of human speech which constitutes the framework for this theory: the post-enlightenment era emphasized a theory of the human conceptional system which "elevates literal speech as the norm of thought and depreciates metaphor as a stylistic deviation from good usage" (Macky, 1990:139). The weaknesses of the substitution theory of metaphor become especially apparent if one applies them to the realm of biblical metaphor. Scholars have pointed out repeatedly that religious language, and especially language about God, is intrinsically metaphorical.23 lt follows that there are
are true when expressed literally, e.g., the metaphorical simile. There is, however, in most cases an incongruency between the subject reality and the representation reality which indicates a metaphorical speech of act. Semantic pointers such as "like" or "as" are often part of the metaphorical speech act.
21 To use Black's, respectively Richards' language: representation would refer to the vehicle, and subject to the tenor.
22 The two latter categories are more prevalent in the literature of the NT. Nielsen argues, however, that metaphor and imagery are indeed referring to the same phenomenon, combining all categories of figurative speech under the term imagery. Her definition of metaphor, that "Tue metaphor [her italics] consists of two statements that interact with one another by reason oftheir mutual dissimilarity" (1989:61), seems too broad and not relevant for the present study.
23 This will especially concem us later when we will discuss the metaphorical nature ofthe way the biblical authors talked about God.



3. METAPHORS OF Gon IN THE PSALMS 15
biblical metaphors which cannot be 'resolved' adequately by literal speech, and which have essentially shaped our theological thinking in their function as metaphors, even though their metaphorical character is hidden at times.24 The substitution theory of metaphor underestimates the significance of the metaphor in the shaping of human thought and language. Macky comes to the conclusion that: ... Absolute Literalism [i.e., the substitution theory of metaphor] is too simple. We are not able to take all our metaphors andre-express them in literal speech. We are [his italics] almost always able to re-express novel metaphors in more standard speech. But that standard speech is often composed of hidden metaphors (1990:155f.).
3.1.2.2. Universal Theory ofMetaphor25
This theory is diametrically opposed to the substitution theory of metaphor and emphasizes the universal metaphorical character of biblical language. The universal theory of metaphor as advanced by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) acknowledges the existence of hidden and unrecognized metaphors in standard language, and asserts that "our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature" (1980:3).26 However, the universal theory of metaphor has gone too far in limiting our conceptual system exclusively to the realm of metaphor. lt does not acknowledge the contextual differences of the recipient of a metaphor which will determine whether a metaphor points to a concept or to a literal reality behind it (Macky, 1990:161).
3.1. 2. 3. Intermediate Theory ofMetaphor
This theory advocates a balance between the two preceding views on metaphor, in that it acknowledges the significance of metaphorical speech on the one band, but on the other supports the notion that "we can say some
24 Macky discusses the implications of hidden metaphors, i.e., metaphors that we employ under the assumption that we are using literal language, but which are nevertheless metaphorical in their character (1990:142-162).
25 We have not found an adequate designation for this theory which can be used in a general sense. Macky calls it "Radicalism" (1990:141) which unfortunately is not very descriptive and somehow seems biased.
26 Lakoff and Johnson use an interesting metaphor that has shaped our thinking, i.e., the argument is war metaphor. With regard to arguments we talk of defending, losing, attacking, winning, etc., which reveals that this metaphor is conceptual in character: "Even if you have never fought a fistfight in your life, much less a war, but have been arguing from the time you began to talk, you still conceive of arguments, and execute them, according to the Argument is War [his italics] metaphor because the metaphor is built into the conceptual system of the culture in which you live" (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980:64).



16 3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN HIE PSALMS
things literally about any reality we know directly ..., provided adequate concomitants are available for members of our speech community..." (Macky, 1990:183). The delineating factors for the distinction between metaphor and literal speech are therefore: (1) Adequate Concomitants;27 (2) Situational Context;28 (3) Nature of the Subject, i.e., if observable or supersensible (Macky, 1990:183f.);29 (4) Interaction between Metaphorical Reality and Represented Reality. Metaphorical language therefore can be, and sometimes has to be, understood independently of a literal re-expression. Some biblical metaphors will retain their metaphorical character even if they are paraphrased in more abstract language, since they focus on supersensibles which are at times not understandable outside of metaphorical language. This classification of the theories of metaphor roughly follows Macky' s outline which mentions two more theories of metaphor, namely, sophisticated literalism which contends that "all the presentative (often labeled 'cognitive') aspects of metaphorical speech acts can be reexpressed literally, though it may take a long time before is [sie] clone successfully" (1990:163f.), and modified radicalism which stresses that "all speech about unobservable realities is and must be metaphorical" (1990:164). However, the three mentioned categories suffice to demonstrate the spectrum of theories of metaphor. The significant characteristics and contributions of metaphor theories like the interaction and contextual theory of metaphor have been included under our intermediate theory of metaphor which comes closest to the focus of the present study.30
3.1.3. Characteristics and Types ofBiblical Metaphor
Up to now the discussion of metaphor has mostly been along the lines of metaphor in general. However, the headings and sub-headings indicate that the focus should be on biblical metaphor. Nevertheless, it stands to question
27 That would refer to the "verbal cotext" or the "set of signs" mentioned by Korpel (1990:77).
28 Both the user's and the receiver's context are significant factors for the formation of a metaphor (Korpel, 1990:60).
29 Macky refers to this theory, which he obviously favours, as critical metaphoricalism, alluding to the critical realism theory ofmodels adduced by Soskice (1985).
30 The intermediate theory of metaphor is a modification of Macky's critical metaphoricalism which has been adapted for the purpose ofthis study.



3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS 17
if one can rightly draw a line between biblical metaphor and non-biblical metaphor. Emphasizes Korpel: "First of all it has tobe observed that there is no basic difference between religious and other metaphors. To speak about the 'arm' of God is just as accurate, or inaccurate, as to speak about a 'black hole' in modern astronomy" (Korpel, 1990:77). She rightly notices that only a few modern studies published from the perspective of biblical scholarship about biblical metaphor have implemented the observations gained in the field of general linguistics and the philosophy of language (1990:32).31 lf one had to search for differences between biblical and nonbiblical metaphors, one would come to the conclusion that there is a quantitative difference in metaphors that deal with observables and supersensibles in and outside the Bible. To compare the metaphors about supersensibles, viz., about the Divine, from biblical and extra-biblical perspectives is the task of the present study.
3.1.3.1. General Types ofMetaphor
(1) Substitutionary Metaphors: These metaphors reflect the partial validity of the substitutionalist's observation that some metaphors are used to describe an unknown reality through the eyes of a better-known reality by means of a representation. The most prevalent metaphor in the Bible is the one that conceptionalizes the non-physical32 in terms of the physical, e.g., "The LORD is my light" (Psa 27:1). Tue connection between subject reality and representation reality is usually a one-way relationship, leading from representation to subject, which means for the above mentioned example that the metaphor of light will probably enhance my understanding aboutGod. (2) Interactive Metaphors: Interactive metaphors stress the relationship between the subject reality and its representation reality, and are mainly applicable when considering non-physical realities which point to deeper or more mysterious non-physical realities, e.g., "God is love" (1 John 4:8). An interactive metaphor points to a bi-directional relationship between subject reality and representation reality, implying that for both sides of the metaphorical equation a change of meaning will take place. "God is love"
31 Among these are: Porter (1983), Bj0mdalen (1986), Bourgnot (1987), Brettler (1989), Mettinger (1989), Korpel (1990), and Macky (1990).
32 The subject of these metaphors is often the supersensible, e.g., "human inner states and processes; social states and processes; the supematural realm; and the interaction between the supematural realm and the human realm" (Macky, 1990:59).



18 3. METAPHORS OF ÜOD IN THE PSALMS
will probably change our understanding of the concept of God as well as of our concept of love.33 (3) Ornamental Metaphors: This type of metaphor is easily definable in that it is applied for ornamental or aesthetic purposes, and sometimes serves a special rhetoric device. These metaphors can be re-expressed literally and correspond closely to their literal paraphrase. The biblical book of Proverbs often makes use of the form of an ornamental metaphor, e.g., "Buy truth, and do not sell it" could be paraphrased literally as "Seek truth diligently until you find it and then do not forget it" (Macky, 1990:65).
3.1.3.2. Between Living and Dead Metaphors
There is a progression from novel or living metaphors to retired or dead metaphors.34 lt is important to recognize the state of an act of speech in order to determine if it is a hidden or a moribund metaphor, i.e., used in a literal sense. Brettler points to the significant fact that there are also metaphors that have been revived and as an important criterion he suggests that "dead metaphors do not have associated submetaphors" (1989:21), i.e., metaphors that are not identical with the original one, but belong to it via association.35 This observation brings us to the history of a certain metaphor which is especially of interest for the biblical scholar since he studies metaphors synchronically and diachronically, namely, metaphors which have been used and re-used throughout centuries.36 This notion in effect overthrows the fine lines drawn between the different types of metaphor so that a substitutionary metaphor may become an interactive one or vice versa (Nielsen, 1989:50). The same principle applies to the road from the
33 Sometimes it appears rather difficult to draw the Iine between a one-directional and a bidirectional metaphor, since it depends largely on the recipient of the metaphor. Macky mentions the metaphor of Psa 23, "The Lord is my shepherd", which may be a bidirectional metaphor for the person who has a limited concept of a shepherd, but for a shepherd with a clear-defined concept of his work it may only be one-directional (1990:63).
34 Macky mentions five categories in that spectrum: "(l) novel metaphors: unusual, unfamiliar; (2) familiar metaphors: not new, but not standard either; (3) standard metaphors: established uses still recognized as metaphorical, one for which a few standard positive and negative analogies have been agreed; (4) hidden metaphors: established uses that some users have forgotten are metaphorical; (5) retired metaphors: those that have become literal speech for most adult users; generally called 'dead"' (1990:72f.).
35 Discussing the metaphor of "God is King", he mentions submetaphors like "God is enthroned" and "God's majesty is celebrated" (1989:21).
36 In contrast to that, the general linguist studies the question of metaphor often from a purely synchronic perspective which sometimes overlooks the development a metaphor undergoes throughout its history.



3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS 19
living to the dead metaphor, including revived metaphors. lt therefore seems to be desirable to establish the meaning of a metaphor in accordance with its state, history, and usage, as difficult as it may be at times.
3.1.3.3. Understanding Metaphors
The interpretation of metaphors is always bound to a hermeneutic process and in accordance with that is susceptible to being a false interpretation (Korpel, 1990:62). lt therefore is deemed essential to be aware of the hermeneutic processes involved in the process of decoding a metaphor. The understanding37 of a metaphor is dependent on various factors which nevertheless can be reduced to two categories, namely, semantics and context. An understanding of the meaning of the constituent semantic elements of the metaphor has to be combined with the investigation of the literary and situational context. A. Bj0rndalen, who stresses the semantic aspect of the interpretation of metaphors,38 nevertheless comes to the understanding "daß Metaphern immer in einem sprachlichen, eventuell auch situativen Kontext wirksam sind" (1986:51). With these limitations bome in mind, the decoding and interpretation39 of a metaphor has to be initialized by the attempt to reconstruct a copy of the
37 The "Conduit Metaphor", as an explanation for understanding in which meaning is simply transferred via a conduit to the hearer, appears too simplistic and too passive to illustrate the intricacies of understanding the meaning of words, viz., in our case, the understanding ofa metaphor. (Macky, 1990:20). A more accurate explanation would be the following: "Language seems rather to help one person to construct out of his own stock of mental stuff something like a replica, or copy, of someone else's thoughts - a replica which can be more or less accurate, depending on many factors" (Reddy, 1979:287). Understanding is therefore also dependent on the receiver's frame of reference. Comments Macky: "Thus, understanding is not simply a passive reception of meaning; nor is it the precise calculation achieved by summing up the meanings of each word. Rather, understanding is a task for the imagination, guided by the store of standard word uses, standard sentence structures, and standard ways of meaning which the intellect has catalogued" (1990:20f.).
38 Bj0rndalen demonstrates the difficulties associated with the semantic analysis of metaphors, namely the Jack of adequate methods to identify the semantic components of a metaphor with semantic markers. His main contribution to the discussion of metaphor lies in the differentiation between literal and metaphorical speech, i.e., between the conjunctive and disjunctive use of language. Nielsen aptly summarizes his theory: "The main idea of the theory is that a word's meaning consists of different elements, not all of which need to be actualized in the specific language situation. If they are all in action, i.e., all the elements of meaning of which the user of language has knowledge directly and in the specific connexion are of reference to whatever he/she is speaking about, then we are in the presence of conjunctive use. But if only some of these elements of meaning are in action it is disjunctive use. And it is then this disjunctive use which manifests itselfin metaphorical language" (1989:39).
39 Cf. Nielsen, who has summarized the exegetic consequences of the theoretical considerations about metaphor (1989:66f.).

original speaker's meaning, though not in the sense of substituting the metaphor with literal speech and translating it thus, but rather in a way that tries to re-create the thoughts of the speaker in an imaginative way.
That can only be done by a combination of imaginative hypothesizing and critical evaluating of the hypotheses. That is essentially the combination that we are proposing here: by our imaginations we attempt to reconstruct the speaker's thinking; then by our critical intellects we judge the adequacy of our reconstructions (Macky, 1990:22).
The decoding and interpretation of metaphor has thus to be controlled by a semantic analysis and the test of viability for the reconstructions of the original meaning of the metaphor. Therefore, this study focuses on the understanding of the metaphors of God used in the book of psalms against their biblical and ancient Near Eastem background which were the essential literary and situational contexts. lt is the attempt to find the path back40 to the intention of the speaker who once used these metaphors to communicate a specific truth about an unobservable reality. By the same token, the limitations of these interpretations have to be ascertained. Since our knowledge of the various contexts remains restricted, there can be no final understanding and interpretation of a metaphor.41 Only the application of a cautious process42 of analysis, moving from the semantic analysis through the hierarchy of various contexts, can produce an adequate understanding of a specific metaphor which approximates the meaning intended within its ancient context, although in the final analysis it is always the modern recipient of the metaphor who ascribes a certain meaning to it.
40 This expression serves to reiterate the point that each metaphor has its own history, characterized by uses and re-uses, even retired stages (Nielsen, 1989:66f.).
41 If there is any at all: "Die Metapher erscheint aber in diesem Lichte eher nichtabschließend-interpretierbar..." (Bj0mdalen, 1986:54).
42 lt is interesting to notice the various degrees ofvagueness that pertain to the publications about the subject of decoding a metaphor in a correct way. Macky points out that in the process various cognitive activities like "knowing, imagining, speaking, meaning, understanding and explaining" (1990:8) are involved. However, there is no clear definition of how these components work together in the decoding process. Bj0mdalen comes to a similar vague conclusion after attempting to find a method for analyzing the semantic components of a metaphor: "Wir bleiben nach diesen Erwägungen dabei, uns auf intuitives Ermitteln besonders relevanter Bedeutungselemente der Metaphern zu beschränken" (1986:59). lt seems to lie in the nature ofthe metaphor to evade the grip of a clearly defined methodology; therefore, the closest approximation to an adequate interpretation must take the various contexts (see above) into consideration before it arrives at any deduction.

3.1.4. Biblical Metaphors of God
The metaphorical character of God-talk has evoked wide interest during the past years, especially from the side of systematic theologians (Korpel, 1990:32),43 whereas the metaphorical language of God lies at the centre of the discussion for the present study.
3.1.4.1. The Metaphorical Nature o/God-Talk
The classical theory of metaphors of God is the notion that "metaphorical language is intrinsic to all God-talk" (Brettler, 1989: 17).44 The underlying theoretical assumptions for this theory can be summarized as follows: (1) the subject of God-talk is a supematural reality which is infinitely incomprehensible and unimaginable; and (2) the conveying instrument of God-talk is human speech which is intrinsically finite and imperfect, working with concepts limited by chronology and dimension. Therefore, God-talk has to operate under the inhibitions of this apparent paradox, and therefore can only use figurative language, the analogical language of metaphor and symbol, to express it (Macky, 1990:191). Contrary to this view, it has to be pointed out that the biblical writers employed both literal45 and figurative speech when they spoke about God, a fact that would dispute the exclusiveness of the theory of the allmetaphorical God-talk. According to Macky, in categorizing the various ways in which the Old Testament writers spoke about God, one can distinguish three classes: (1) when speaking about God negatively, the biblical authors usually employed literal language;46 (2) in describing the
43 Cf. the contributions of contextual theologies which try to re-interpret biblical metaphors of God on the basis of current sociological debates, e.g., black theology or feminist theology. However, these re-interpretations appear to fall short of acknowledging the actual biblical linguistic evidence and have to be understood more along the lines of a type of etymologizing which Barr (1961; 1968) has sufficiently discussed (Korpel, 1990:26-31). 44 For similar statements cf. Macky (1990:190f.) and Bj0I11dalen (1986:62).
45 Macky painstakingly goes into a detailed description ofhow the biblical writers spoke of God in a literal sense: on the assumption that if one can demonstrate a universally applicable positive/negative pair of concepts he argues that "one or the other concept is literally applicable to everything we can name" (1990:194). Macky adduces two biblical concepts, i.e., the positive/negative pairs real/imaginary and active/wholly passive as applied to God versus the pagan gods. He comes to the conclusion that the biblical writers applied these terms Iiterally to God, and with that he counters the notion that all God-talk is intrinsically metaphorical (1990:192-216).
46 Examples ofthis negative God-talk can be seen in Dt 32:4, Job 34:12, Hos 11:8-9, etc. However, in negatively qualifying God there is no specification of how God is, and therefore, a negative description will only produce an imprecise vague indication of subject in question (Macky, 1990:218).



22 3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS
dimension of God's salvation activities, the biblical writers used literal speech;47 and (3) the rest of the language utilized for the description of God in the Bible is metaphorical in character (1990:217). Although these three classes can be observed, it nevertheless appears that the delineating factors are defined too broadly, not taking into account the fact that our understanding of a text' s being a metaphor about God must not necessitate a similar use of language for the original speaker for this act of speech. As Bj0mdalen puts it: "Aber man darf keineswegs davon ausgehen, daß Rede, die uns bildhaft erscheint, auch den Israeliten bildhaft, und in derselben Weise bildhaft gewesen ist" (1986:62). He then discusses the metaphorical character of God-talk, referring to texts about Yahweh's inner capacities, his body parts, and his actions, especially in the prophetic literature of the 8th century B.C. (cf. also Kruger, 1988:143-151).48 Finding evidences that point to both conjunctive and disjunctive uses of language, he concludes: Aussagen über Jahwe im Alten Testament müssen keineswegs notwendig metaphorisch im Sinne A. Reichlings gewesen sein, und die im Alten Testament tatsächlich vorkommende Metaphorik über Jahwe ist nicht notwendig speziell in seinem Gottsein begründet, sondern in seiner Zuwendung zu Israel hin und zur Welt, in seinem Bezug auf Israel und die Welt. Jede möglicherweise metaphorische Aussage ist auf ihre eigene semantische Wirkungsweise und auf ihren eigenen semantischen Inhalt hin zu befragen (1986:96). Again, we are referred to the realm of context from the perspective of semantic analysis, judging each individual occurrence according to its possible metaphorical value within its semantic, literary, and sociological context.49
3.1. 4.2. Anthropomorphisms and the Metaphors ofGod
The apparent difficulties in defining the borderlines for biblical metaphors of God might be rooted in the discomfort about the anthropomorphic
descriptions of the Divine in the Bible.5°Korpel has discussed the various
47 The dimension of God's saving activities encompasses a variety of semantic fields which can be summarized under the general category of providing benefits. However, the literal use becomes especially apparent within the NT context. Otherwise, these positive activities of God appear to be metaphorical "whenever the author referred or alluded to some physical state or activity that could be the symbol" (Macky, 1990:229).
48 Tue discussion of anthropomorphic depictions of God in connection with the question of metaphors will be dealt with shortly.
49 Louw makes ethnological and sociological categories parts of the semantic analysis and, with that, emphasizes the interrelation ofsemantics and contextual issues (1992:1080).
50 With regard to the question of anthropomorphism and metaphor, Brettler turns to the two major biblical theologies of this century, and observes: "Eichrodt (1961:145) sidesteps the whole issue by declaring 'according to the ideas of Jahwism, it cannot be said that Israel regarded God anthropomorphically, but the reverse, that she considered man theophoric'. Von Rad (1962:212...) has a different solution; he discusses



3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS 23
anthropomorphic51 depictions of God in comparison with similar descriptions of the Divine in Ugarit. She notes that "to imagine God as anthropomorphic was merely a way of speaking" (1990:627). To imagine God in human terms is therefore characteristic of the biblical God-talk, but it does not automatically necessitate the presence of metaphorical language.52 Again, the general rules, laid down for the distinction between metaphorical and literal speech, have to be applied in order to arrive at an adequate conclusion about a specific anthropomorphism. Although the purpose of the anthropomorphic metaphors is a description of God' s essential qualities, it cannot be defined as the attempt to describe the spiritualitas dei,53 a notion that would merely reflect the substitutionalist's view of metaphor. Rather, it has to be seen in terms of an interactive act of speech that hints at the literally inexplicable realities connected with the character of God. Thus the anthropomorphic metaphors of God cannot be translated or replaced with abstractions ofthe metaphor, since the metaphor itself enhances our understanding about the characteristics of God.
3.1.4.3. Religious Historical and Literary Historical Aspect
The metaphors of God used in biblical literature, and especially in the book of psalms, are a reflection of the Gottesvorstellung and Gottesbild54 the
anthropomorphism under 'God as spiritual'(!) and notes that biblical anthropomorphisms used are second best to 'Christian faith [which] has been able to accommodate the recognition of God's spiritual nature without prejudice to his immediacy in religion, because it has its focus in the person of Jesus..."' (1989:27f.). J. Jeremias' Theophanie: die Geschichte einer alttestamentlichen Gattung (1965) shifts the problem to the area of form criticism: he identifies the "Gattung der Theophanieschilderungen" (1965:3) and tries to establish their original form and Sitz im Leben (1965:6). For the purpose of the present study, we will make no differentiation between theophanies and other anthropomorphic depictions, i.e., metaphors of God.
51 Besides the anthropomorphic depictions of God we also find theriomorphic and physiomorphic descriptions. The adjoining discussion of the anthropomorphisms does, therefore, also refer to these categories.
52 Bj0rndalen gives a number of examples from the prophetic books of Arnos, Hosea, and Isaiah which elucidate the ambiguity of biblical anthropomorphisms, and summarizes: "Solche Rede kann metaphorisch sein, muß es aber nicht sein, und wo sie es ist, ist das nicht notwendig speziell in Gottes Gottsein zu begründen" (1986:93). For him, the determining factor, again, is the conjunctive or disjunctive use of language in the individual text.
53 Korpel calls the Spirituality of God "nothing but an incomplete theorem of Western theology" (1990:628).
54 Mettinger distinguishes between the Gottesvorstellung, i.e., the mental concept which was thought about God, and the Gottesbild, i.e., the way in which the Gottesvorstellung was communicated and expressed through texts and iconography (1989:135). Applied to the biblical metaphor of God, it would correspond to the relationship between representation reality and subject reality. However, this distinction seems not always



24 3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS
individual author bad: "When the Gottesbild is expressed on the level of language it goes without saying that the role of metaphor is of fundamental importance" (Mettinger, 1989: 138). The religious historical aspect of the present study, however, has to be understood in a limited way.55 Whether these metaphors of God are an expression of the official, popular, or personal religious view of God56 is of secondary importance for the present study, since the focus is not on a reconstruction of the religious history of Israel, but rather on an understanding of an integral segment of Israelite belief, i.e., the concept of God as expressed through the window of
clear-cut: an anthropomorphic metaphorical depiction of God may not be adduced as being the explicit Gottesbild of the author who used it. Therefore, although we acknowledge the differences between the two, we would rather prefer an interactive view of Gottesvorstellung and Gottesbild.
55 lt does not seem necessary for the scope of this study to reiterate the present state of religious historical research. For a valuable summary of the trends in the discipline of religious historical studies, see P. D. Miller's chapter on lsraelite religion in The Hebrew Bible and its Modern Interpreters (1985). A number of more recent studies that contribute to the understanding oflsrael's religion, and which reflect the current issues in the debate, are: J. C. de Moor, The Rise of Yahwism (1990); H. Niehr, Der höchste Gott (1990); R. Albertz, Religionsgeschichte Israels in alttestamentlicher Zeit (1992); and 0. Keel and C. Uehlinger, Göttinnen, Götter und Gottessymbole (1992).
56 R. Albertz (1978) has pointed out the sociological differences between Großkult and Kleinkult, and distinguishes between official, local, and family religion (1992:43), although one has to emphasize the fact that these categories never existed in a rigid way. To ultimately designate a specific text to one ofthese categories seems to go beyond the scope of the present study. Therefore, one has to be cautious with regard to general deductions made about the Gottesbild or Gottesvorstellung of Israel on account of the metaphors presented here, and keep in mind the preliminary character of such statements. Mettinger hints at these complications, noting that the Gottesbild, viz., Gottesbilder might have been dependent on various factors, such as sociological, theological, chronological, or literary differences (1989:136f.). Iconographic evidence has been suggested as the most possible source for evidence of the personal piety of the people oflsrael (Eggler, 1992:32; Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:471). But even here we are confronted with restrictive factors such as the history of a respective motif, the origin of an iconographic artifact, the issue of iconographic interpretation, etc. (cf. Klingbeil, 1992:29-32). However, recently the notion has been expressed to understand the different sociological levels of religion not as mutually exclusive, but as an interactive unity: "Bei aller Berechtigung der Differenzierung von Religionsebenen wird deshalb künftig auch die Durchlässigkeit der verschiedenen Ebenen und ihre globale Kohärenz [his italics] innerhalb des jeweiligen religiösen Symbolsystems vermehrt zu bedenken sein" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:472). Miller adduces a further complication involved in the differentiation between various levels of religion: "... one must ask whether it is really possible to mark off a core of personal piety distinguishable from the official cult when many of the verbs and nouns can be and are used in Yahwistic expressions that would be associated with the Yahwism of the sanctuary and the community" (1985:216).

metaphor in the book of psalms.57 Thus issues of chronology58 are not of primary importance for this study.59 lt becomes obvious that the subject ofthis study, i.e., the metaphor of God in the psalms, is not directly related to the issue of reconstructing Israel's religious history, and that its objective, viz., to understand these metaphors against their biblical and ancient Near Eastem backdrops, is not completely congruent with the goals of the religious history research, although religious historical aspects certainly form an important part of the present discussion. Nevertheless, the contribution of the study may be of some value for the ubiquitous religious historical debate about Monotheism versus Polytheism.60
57 The psalms do not at all !end themselves easily for religious historical reconstructions, since their composition and compilation is a diverse process, giving very little indication of chronological categories. Ackroyd has convincingly questioned the criteria for a Maccabean dating of some psalms, but nevertheless comes to the conclusion that one should not "create a false impression of reliable dating for Old Testament literature
when such dating is at present impossible" (1953:132). lt is interesting to note that the article on the book of psalms in the recently published ABD leaves out questions of dating altogether. The closest the author of the article comes to an explanation for the origin of the psalms is his statement that the "Psalms originated in the midst of Israel' s life..." (Limburg, 1992:524; cf. also Westermann, 1980:12).
58 lt might, however, be possible to demonstrate that one can establish a relative chronology of the texts under discussion, and with that, trace the historical development of a certain metaphor.
59 This, of course, poses some important questions for the chronological delimitations of
the comparative material adduced for this study. lt becomes apparent that chronological issues cannot be avoided altogether: the present study does not subscribe to the hypothesis ofvan Seters (1975) "who places virtually the whole ofthe OT literature in the exilic and post-exilic eras" (Miller, 1985:213). That there are criteria for determining the antiquity of a text, at least in the case of poetry, has been demonstrated by scholars like Cross and Freedman (1975; see also Freedman, 1980). The result ofthe application of these criteria to the texts under discussion has to determine the chronological context of the comparative material. Brettler solves the question of chronology in distinguishing "between pre-exilic and post-exilic texts" (1989:24).
60 lt deems not necessary to go into the varied details of this debate. The debate has been at the center ofrecent religious historical studies (Niehr, 1992:463), and has moved more toward the question ofthe rise ofYahwism (Niehr, 1990:1; de Moor, 1990:2). There are basically two camps to be distinguished: one group proposes that the origins for the rise of Yahwism can be pushed back into the second millennium B.C. during the Late Bronze Age (de Moor, 1990:261-264; Korpel, 1990). The other emphasizes the first millennium Syro-Canaanite origin of Yahweh (Niehr, 1990). From this perspective, the criticism of Korpel's study A Rift in the C/ouds (1990), adduced in a book review by Niehr (1992:462f.), becomes obvious. Niehr who opts for an exilic and post-exilic dating of the material, cannot possibly agree to an early origin of Yahwism. However, the positive aspect of these current discussions is that the somewhat neglected perspective of comparative religion has increasingly been implemented in the debate.



26 3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS
Nevertheless, T. Mettinger, in discussing the relationship between Gottesbild and metaphor, goes as far as to attempt a definition of the root metaphor61 for God in the official cult of Judah in pre-exilic times. After identifying the root metaphor of the northem kingdom of Israel as that of the covenant, the author proceeds to demonstrate that the root metaphor of Judah was basileomorphic, i.e., God depicted as king, combining the characteristics of the Canaanite gods EI and Ba'al62 in his personality. Although we acknowledge the importance of the royal metaphor of God,63 it stands to question if one can really reduce the Gottesbild and Gottesvorstellung to a single root metaphor, especially since it would involve an accurate dating of this metaphor. Mettinger's root metaphor appears to be a religious historical reconstruction that does not depart from the biblical text, but from a hypothesis, according to which the data is then assembled.64 To correlate the extra-biblical evidence without qualifications to the biblical text appears methodologically unsound. However, our sources are too Iimited to make such a far-reaching conclusion of the above-mentioned nature. lt is the endeavor to compare the biblical metaphors of God with extrabiblical literary and iconographic motifs in a methodologically sound way. Therefore, the relevant biblical passages are first presented without resorting to comparative sources before they are set in comparison and contrast with extra-biblical material.
61 A root metaphor is a basic model or analogy, "used to describe the nature ofthe world, a way ofseeing 'all that is' through a specific key concept" (Mettinger, 1989:138).
62 "EI is the enthroned god, Baal the one who acquires his kingship through his conflict with the chaotic forces and who acquires a palace, a temple, as the symbol of his royal status" (Mettinger, 1989:139f.).
63 Brettler in his valuable study of God as king from a metaphorical perspective, comes to the conclusion that this metaphor "is the predominant rational metaphor used of God in the Bible" (1989:160).
64 Mettinger seems to work primarily with extra-biblical texts, proceeding from there in a somewhat arbitrary way to the biblical text (1989:139f.). From the perspective of religious history, Keel and Uehlinger have produced an iconographic study of ca. 8500 stamp-seals from excavations in Palestine/Israel. At the end of this valuable contribution, the authors ask some important questions with regard to religious historical reconstructions in Israel and Judah: "Wir glauben nicht, daß es in Israel und Juda eine eigentliche Jahwe-Ikonographie gegeben hat. Dies heißt nicht, daß nicht manche Israelitinnen oder Israeliten, Judäerinnen oder Judäer im einen und andern der hier vorgestellten Bilder eine angemessene Darstellung ihres Gottes erkannt hätten. Aber reicht das für den Versuch, eine Religionsgeschichte Israels aufgrund nicht nur epigraphischer, sondern auch und vor allem ikonographischer Zeugnisse zu skizzieren?" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:472).



3. METAPHORS OF Gon IN THE PSALMS 27
For a literary historical perspective, a short note has to suffice: the notion that biblical literature is a mere reflection of the influence Canaanite, and especially Ugaritic, religious literature had on Israel's literary history, has not left the realm of an unproved hypothesis.65 Although we acknowledge the ancient Near Eastem cultural and literary historical stream of which the literature of the Old Testament was naturally a part, we do not a priori exclude the possibility of original Israelite literary work in the sense of a certain conceptual autonomy, reflected in the concepts found in the Old Testament, viz., the book of psalms.66 Thus metaphors of God in the book of psalms will first have to be analyzed within their own biblical context before proceeding to the extemal evidence.67
3.1.5. Evaluation ofBiblical Metaphor
The discussion of the various aspects of metaphor and their significance for the present study can be summarized as following: (1) Only during recent years has there been a growing interest of biblical scholarship in methodological considerations about metaphor derived from the field of linguistics and the philosophy of language. (2) Since there is no general difference between religious and non-religious metaphors, the result of modern research has to be applied to biblical metaphors as well. (3) The theory of metaphor for this study has been described above as the intermediate theory of metaphor with its delineating criteria. lt appears that the most frequent form of biblical metaphor is the interactive metaphor which, in the final analysis, cannot be abstracted successfully.
65 Cf. the study of H. Niehr with respect to the origin of Yahwism: "Angesichts dieser Sachlage ist es nicht mehr möglich, in den Pfaden der gängigen religionsgeschichtlichen Arbeit am AT zu verbleiben und zu behaupten, JHWH sei in Israel an die Stelle des Gottes EI getreten, um somit das Bild JHWHs als des höchsten Gottes mit Zügen des aus Ugarit bekannten EI aufzufüllen" (1990:223). Niehr then proceeds to show that Yahweh rather displays characteristics ofthe Syro-Canaanite God Ba'alfamen from the first millennium B.C. He proposes that the reception of these concepts into biblical literature took place during the exilic and post-exilic era. Although we can emulate his criticism of an unqualified application of Ugarit literature for the history of Old Testament literature (1990:llf.), his deductions nevertheless seem to only substitute Syro-Canaanite for Ugaritic influence which shifts, but does not solve the problem.
66 Although coming from an iconographic perspective, Keel and Uehlinger's conclusion "daß weder ein mosaischer Monotheismus noch manche der so beliebten Spät- und Spätestdatierungen von der external evidence [his italics] gedeckt werden" (1992:473), seems nevertheless also applicable to the field of external literary historical evidence. 67 Cf. our discussion above ofthe comparative method.



28 3. METAPHORS OF Gon IN THE PSALMS
(4) There is no final understanding of a metaphor, since every metaphor has its history, i.e., various stages between living and dead, or novel and retired metaphors. Every interpretation is susceptible to the <langer of being incorrect. (5) Metaphorical language is an adequate vehicle and is often used as such in the Bible to describe unobservable realities, especially to talk about God.68 (6) Not all God-talk is metaphorical though, and the determining factor for the differentiation between literal and metaphorical use is the question of dependent or independent usage, or in Bj0mdalen's terminology, conjunctive or disjunctive use of the elements. (7) Metaphors of God often use anthropomorphic, as well as theriomorphic and physiomorphic language. However, not every anthropomorphic expression has to be metaphorical in character. (8) Biblical metaphors of God are a reflection of the Gottesbild or Gottesvorstellung the respective authors had. The focus of this study is not on a religious historical reconstruction of the concept of God, however, but on an understanding of the metaphors against their biblical and ancient Near Eastem background. Thus the scope of the study is not a diachronic depiction of the issue, but a synchronic comparison, although the differentiation between diachronism and synchronism appears at times difficult, since one works within a certain chronological range.69
3.2. SURVEY OF METAPHORS OF GOD IN THE PSALMS
The following synoptic table shows the distribution of metaphors and submetaphors in the Hebrew Psalter. However, it has to be stressed that metaphors at times form clusters, i.e., different metaphors are used in very close proximity to each other, often overlapping each other.70 lt is therefore
68 As Mettinger puts it: "During the last few decades the philosophical, linguistic and literary study of metaphor has opened up new vistas. The Old Testament metaphors for God represent an immense collection ofmaterial that has never been made the subject of a systematic review in the light ofthese new insights" (1989:138).
69 Korpel has touched on the methodological complications of her study in which she compares the religious language of Ugarit with that of the Old Testament: "Because of the prevalent scholarly dissent with regard to the dating of almost every part of the Old Testament, it is unfeasible to draw up a study like this according to any rigorous diachronic plan" (1990:79). Since a late dating, i.e., an exilic and post-exilic dating, of the psalms is by no means scholarly consensus yet, it appears legitimate to work from a !arger ancient Near Eastem comparative perspective.
7° Cf. for example Psa 23 which seems to present the metaphor of God as the shepherd.
Note, however, that in vs. 5 suddenly the imagery changes and the metaphor of God as the host becomes dominant (cf. Kraus, 1961:190).



3. METAPHORS OF Goo IN THE PSALMS 29
sometimes rather difficult to isolate the various metaphors correctly. Due to that fact, the following survey71 will appear to a certain extent synthetic, and a number of occurrences will be classified as presenting more than one metaphor. This was done in order to avoid a too atomistic approach, allowing for the intricate literary relationships between different metaphors. In the same fashion, there will be passages listed as pointing to one single metaphor, although there may be indications that their constituent vss. could be part of various different metaphors.72 However, the procedure of identifying the various metaphors for God in the psalms seems necessary in order to gain an impression of the total variance of metaphors employed by the authors of the various psalms.73 Proceeding from this, an adequate decision can be made as to which metaphor will be used for the comparative section ofthe study.
Metaphor Suhmetaphor Occurrence
God's body face 4:7; 11:7; 13:2; 16:11; 17:2; 17:15; 21:7; 22:25; 24:6; 27:8; 27:9; 30:8; 31:17; 31:21; 34:17; 41:13; 42:3; 42:6; 44:4; 44:25; 51:11; 51:13; 56:14; 67:2; 68:2; 68:3; 68:4; 69:18; 80:4; 80:8; 80:17; 80:20; 88:3; 88:15; 89:15; 89:16; 90:8; 95:2; 96:6; 100:2; 102:3; 104:29; 105:4; 119:135; 139:7; 143:7 ear 10:17; 17:6; 18:7; 31:3; 34:16; 71:2; 86:1; 88:3; 102:3; 116:2; 130:2 eye 11:4; 17:2; 31:23; 32:8; 33:18; 34:16; 51:6; 66:7; 90:4; 116:15; 139:16 evelids 11:4 mouth 105:5; 119:13; 119:72; 119:88 lips 17:4; 89:35 arm 44:4; 71:18; 77:16; 79:11; 89:14; 89:22; 136:12 palm 139:5
71 The table is a synoptic representation of a computer-standardized survey of the Hebrew psalter based on the text of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (1969), conducted as a preliminary groundwork for the present study. Space constraints do not permit to reproduce the survey here in its entirety. During the survey the metaphors were classified according to main metaphor, its respective submetaphor, metaphor type (i.e., substitutionary, interactive, or ornamental) and metaphor category (i.e., anthropomorphic, theriomorphic, or physiomorphic). For an explanation ofthe different types and categories ofmetaphor, cf. 3.1.3.1. and 3.1.5.
72 E.g. Psa 11 :4-6 which was identified as belonging to the God of heaven metaphor although vs. 5 could actually be part ofthe judge metaphor.

appear to be over-significant but, although it is certainly correct to assume that the biblical author drew his metaphors from a limited number of literary images, the significance of the number increases nevertheless, if one considers the broad spectrum of submetaphors for each metaphor.76

Graph 1: Overall distribution ofmetaphors
lt becomes apparent that the God's body metaphor represents the most widely-used metaphor in the book of psalms. However, one has to take into consideration that the anthropomorphic depiction of God is a prevalent standard literary device in biblical writing, while the various submetaphors of this imagery often take on an almost literal character, departing from
various metaphors. However, through the standardized approach used during the survey, a relatively high accuracy has been maintained.
76 E.g., the God of heaven metapor has 45 submetaphors which represents a substantial figure.

their original metaphorical intentions. In addition to this fact, the various submetaphors ofthe God's body are not as related in meaning as is the case with other metaphors. Thus the God's body metaphor presents a special case and should not be treated in the same way as other images. From the graph it becomes clear how the remaining metaphors are weighed according to their occurrence.
3.4.2. Distribution According to Metaphor Type
During the survey we have differentiated between interactive, substitutionary, and ornamental metaphor types. The following graph shows the results of this criterion. The graph clearly shows that the majority of occurrences are of the interactive type, i.e., metaphors with a bi-directional relationship between subject reality and representation reality. lt was interesting to note that
Graph 2: Distribution according to metaphor type
particularly submetaphors of the God's body metaphor tend to be of the substitutionary type, e.g., God' s face as a substitutionary metaphor for his presence (Psa 139:7; 140:14; 143:7; etc.). Ornamental metaphors appeared predominantly in reference to the temple in Jerusalem for which the psalmists employed a variety of ornamental imagery (e.g., 132:13; 134:1; 135:2).
3.4.3. Distribution According to Metaphor Category
During the survey three categories of metaphor were identified of which the majority was the anthropomorphic depiction of God, followed by physiomorphic imagery of the divine. The theriomorphic depictions of God were limited to the submetaphor of God's wings (17:8; 36:8; 57:2; 61 :5; 63:8; 91:1; 91:4). The anthropomorphic depiction of God was the predominant medium to communicate the divine by ways of metaphor.

The warrior and God of heaven metaphors represent the imagery we would like to concentrate our attention on in the following section, since apart from the God's body metaphor, they represent the most frequently used metaphors, especially if understood as representing a combined metaphor. lt appears to be necessary to give a more detailed analysis of their appearance in the book of psalms. The two following tables show their distribution according to the traditional five-fold division of the psalms.

remaining three books is clearly on the decline with the warrior metaphor appearing not at all in Books 4 and 5 of the Hebrew psalter. During the following exegetical part we will thus have to concentrate on those psalms where the God of heaven and warrior metaphors occur as a predominant theme. The survey has shown that these two metaphors at times clearly overlap,77 forming a certain unity which should not be dissected artificially through concentrating on either ofthem to the exclusion of the other.
77 This overlapping becomes especially apparent in Psa 83 and 144 which we have identified as belonging to the God of heaven metaphor. However, as Brettler has shown, the imagery employed in these two psalms is also part of the warrior metaphor (1993:135-165).



4. GOD AS WARRIOR AND AS GOD OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER
After having identified the various metaphors of God which have been employed by the authors of the Hebrew psalter in outline, this chapter will concentrate on the warrior and God of heaven metaphors, trying to establish their respective meaning within an exegetical framework. This will be preceded by some theoretical considerations about the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter.
4.1. APPROACH TO THE EXEGESIS OF THE HEBREW PSALTER
The exegesis of the Hebrew psalter has been dominated by and large by form-critical considerations1 first promulgated by H. Gunkel at the turn of the century.2 He classified the Hebrew psalter according to five basic types: hymns, communal laments, royal psalms, individual laments, and individual songs of thanksgiving. These categories have been accepted widely and predominantly by European scholars, and applied with slight modifications throughout the present century,.3 A working definition of form criticism is given by Barton: "In the OT, form criticism is a method of study that identifies and classifies the smaller compositional units of biblical texts, and seeks to discover the social setting within which units of these types or literary genres were originally used" (1992:838). The classical approach of the form critical analysis can be summarized as follows: "Analysis of a text begins by identifying each form within it, grouping them together to identify the Gattung, and then asking about the text's Sitz im Leben [his italics] and its function" (Barton, 1992:839). Although one has to appreciate the contribution of the formcritical analysis in determining the social setting of texts, it has become debatable if it presents an adequate tool for the determination of the actual
1 "Das gattungsgeschichtliche Verständnis der Psalmen ist heute nahezu ohne Alternative" (Neumann, 1976:2).
2 This is the fifth edition of Die Psalmen, originally published in 1892, in which Gunkel put forth his form-critical analysis ofthe Hebrew psalter. 3 See below under 4.1. l.

usage of a psalm in ancient Israel (Barton, 1992:841).4 Tbis becomes evident if one reviews tbe publications tbat are dealing witb psalmsexegesis.
4.1.1. Survey of Literature
A sbort survey of tbe relevant literature seems to be appropriate wbile the main empbasis will be on tendencies witbin psalms-exegesis of tbe last 25 years.5 Whereas Gunkel saw tbe psalms as individual poems derived from liturgical texts in tbe cult of Israel, Mowinckel (1921-1924; 1962) proceeded along Gunkel' s lines, but simplified bis ideas in establisbing an actual pre-exilic cultic setting for tbe psalms texts. Central to bis view was tbe direct relationsbip between tbe psalms and Israel's worsbip wbicb be tried to reconstruct witb tbe aid of comparative material from other ancient Near Eastem cultures. Especially tbe Yabweb's Thronbesteigungsfest (enthronement-, or in a more active sense, throne-ascension festival) played a dominant role in bis interpretation of tbe Hebrew psalter, forming tbe cultic background to a large number of psalms.6 In subsequent publications one can notice a certain degree of polarization between Gunkel's and Mowinckel's views, although since tbe 1950s tbe tbeory of tbe cultic interpretation and tbe centrality of tbe Thronbesteigungsfest bas noticeably lost impact on tbe study of tbe Hebrew psalter.7 Consequently, it is Gunkel's theory tbat bas since tben provided
4 For a critical evaluation of form criticism in the psalms, see Hasel (1985:39-42) and especially Weiss (1984:47-73).
5 Our survey by no means claims to be exhaustive. For further details, reference is made to the summaries of Neumann (1976), Seybold (1981; 1986), Feininger (1981), and Hopkins (1986). We will nevertheless try to find a representative selection of studies
and commentaries which will illustrate the various tendencies in psalms exegesis. An interesting article about the history of exegesis of the Hebrew psalter is presented by Tate in which he summarizes the main streams in Jewish and Christian psalms interpretation, focusing on the development of psalms exegesis within the historicalcritical method ofthe past 125 years (1984:363-375).
6 Cf. Hauge, who tries to demonstrate that the basic assumptions of Mowinckel and his cult-historical methodology could have led to quite a different result in the interpretation ofthe Hebrew psalter iffollowed consistently (1988a:56-71).
7 Neumann summarizes the adherents to Mowinckel's theory: "In unmittelbarer
Nachfolge Mowinckels stehen z. B. der Däne A. Bentzen und die Schweden 1. Engnell und G. Widengren. ... In der deutschsprachigen Forschung steht dem kultischen
Psalmenverständnis besonders A. Weiser nahe" (1976:8f.). An interesting resurrection of Mowinckel's views has been produced in Eaton's Kingship and the Psalms (1976) where he opts for a royal interpretation of most of the individual psalms, although his universalistic approach does not seem to fit the diversity of the Hebrew psalter. Cf. Seybold's criticism ofEaton (Seybold, 1981:15-17).



40 4. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAYEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER
the major stimulus for the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter,8 although not without alterations and increasing circumspection. Most of the relevant commentaries on the Hebrew psalter have followed Gunkel's form-critical method, although it has to be noticed that the form-critical method finds its main support in German, viz., European circles.9 One has to ask with Seybold, who is reviewing Neumann's compilation of psalms-exegetical literature, "ob wir fast 70 Jahre [sie] nach Gunkels Erkenntnissen von 1911/13, trotz aller oft etwas zu volltönenden Polemik ... wirklich weit darüber hinausgekommen sind" (1981 :4). Form-critical analysis has to face the challenge of being a mere reiteration of a methodology developed under the assumptions and axioms of turn-of-the-century biblical scholarship. An interesting reaction against the insufficiency of the form-critical method is presented by the fifth revised edition of the Biblischer Kommentar Altes Testament which was published in 1978 by H.-J. Kraus. A noticeable shift of exegetical method has taken place between the fourth and the fifth revised edition which is explained by Kraus as follows: Es hat sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten mehr und mehr gezeigt, daß die Gattungsforschung, wie Gunkel und Begrich sie vorgetragen haben, erheblicher Korrekturen und teilweise grundlegender Neufassungen bedarf. War BK XV in den
8 Cf. e.g., Ridderbos (1950); Westermann (1967) who goes beyond Gunkel "in examining the various elements of OT psalm-patterns" (Feininger, 1981 :93) and comes to the conclusion that there are only two general types ofpsalms, i.e., praise and lament. Fora summary of further differentiation and development within the form-critical approach, see Hossfeld and Zenger (1993:17f.).
9 To mention some of the most important commentaries adhering to the form-critical method: Schmidt= HAT 1,15 (1934), Weiser= ATD 14 and 15 (1959), Deissler (1963; 1964; 1965), Kraus= BKAT 15,1 and 15,2 (1960a; 1960b), and Gerstenberger (1988). See also table of commentaries below. However, there are definite nuances in the application of the form-critical method as found in these and other commentaries. Becker in his Wege der Psalmenexegese (1976) has differentiated between the following methodological approaches and their respective proponents: (1) Gebete Angeklagter und Kranker [prayers ofthe accused and the sick] (Schmidt, 1934; Delekat, 1967); (2) Die bundesideologische Deutung [interpretation according to the ideology of covenant] (Weiser, 1959); (3) Psalmen in der Umwelt Israels [psalms in the environment of ancient Israel] - this methodology can only be indirectly linked to Gunkel, since he received substantial impetus for the interpretation of the psalms from the ancient Near East. Becker stresses the importance of the Sumerian and Akkadian prayers while he bypasses the textual material from Ugarit altogether; (4) Frömmigkeitliche Psalmendichtung [anthological interpretation of the psalms] (Deissler, 1963; 1964; 1965); (5) Kollektive Psalmendeutung [collective interpretation of the psalms] although Gunkel rejected this method, it can be added to the )ist of his methodological offsprings via the method ofrelecture which revived this approach (Mowinckel, 1921; Schmidt, 1934). We have made mention ofthese methodological nuances because they can be linked to, or are derived from, Gunkel's work, andin this respect can be added to his approach. This has been done for the sake of clarity without overly trying to simplify matters.

Auflagen 1-4 noch wesentlich bestimmt und geprägt von der Gattungsforschung Gunkels, so erwies es sich bei der vorliegenden Neuauflage als unerläßlich, die Prinzipien und Voraussetzungen, vor allem aber die Grundbegriffe der formgeschichtlichen Forschungen Gunkels und Begrichs zu überprüfen (1978a:38).
Kraus continues bis analysis by pointing out a number of inadequacies of the form-critical method, of which the critique of the fundamental principle of Gattung seems to be the most significant one: "Wo immer genauere Untersuchungen durchgeführt worden sind, da kommt es an den Tag, daß die kategoriale Bestimmung nicht sachgemäß ist. ... Die Defizienz der Gattungsbezeichnungen und der Klassifikationen wird immer offenkundiger" (Kraus, 1978a:39).10 In a brief outline of bis own changed approach to the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter, Kraus focuses instead on descriptive categories based on content and context of the various psalms which he calls "themenorientierte Formengruppen" (1978a:40). In this respect Kraus seems to follow a literary-historical course of action, stressing nevertheless the necessity of form-critical work on the new categories.11 Furthermore, Kraus argues for a balanced approach between the literary appearance of the psalms and their cultic significance,12 while he denies any cyclic enthronement festival as proposed by Mowinckel. In dating the Hebrew psalter, he pushes the oldest psalms back into the premonarchic period (Feininger, 1981:98). Kraus's revised commentary on the psalms abstracts the tendency to question a traditionalized concept and move on further with the exegesis ofthe Hebrew psalter.13 An even more literature-oriented approach to the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter is taken by N. H. Ridderbos (1963; 1972) who tries to go beyond a rigid form-criticism toward a style-criticism of the psalms which treats the individual psalms as poetic literary objects of art (Seybold, 1981 :6).14 This
10 Kraus also expresses concem regarding the vagueness of the criterion ("gemeinsame Formensprache") which, according to Gunkel, determines the Gattung. Furthermore, modern scholarship has gained important insights into Israelite cult and worship which, as the Sitz im Leben, is the main constituent of the Gattung. One has to ask if these advances would not change Gunkel's categories altogether (1978a:38f.).
11 Kraus differentiates between six form-groups (themenorientierte Formgruppen): (l) i1'?i1r1 - Loblieder; (2) il'?.in - Gebetslieder; (3). 7'?r.i';, 'tvlll:l - Königslieder; (4) ]1'~ i't!i Zionlieder; (5) nir.i:,n - Lehrdichtungen; and (6) Lithurgien/Festpsalmen (l978a:40).
12 At the end of the introduction to his approach, Kraus states his aim, though also aware of the intrinsic limitations: "So werden auch die folgenden Ausführungen nur als ein Versuch betrachtet werden können, die Psalmen nach inneren (formalen und thematischinhaltlichen) Ordnungsprinzipien zu disponieren, um damit sachgemäße Voraussetzungen zu einer kontextorientierten Interpretation zu schaffen" (l978a:43).
13 lt appears commendable to see a scholar of Kraus's stature alter his approach in such a significant way.
14 Cf. also the works of Alsonso-Schökel (1971) and Alter (1987; 1992), who follow a literary approach to the biblical texts.

understanding presupposes an emphasis on the text as an organic unity, passing by questions of redaction and historical integration.15 Ridderbos's aim is to identify the function of certain style-figures,16 especially the stylistic device of repetition and chiasmus, and to demonstrate the inner development of the psalm (Neumann, 1976: 17). Another adherent of a more literary approach to the Hebrew psalter is M. Weiss who is also indebted to the works of Buher and Rosenzweig and proposes an exegetical method of Total Interpretation (1986). In criticizing Gunkel, Weiss adduces that the form-critical method is an exclusive extemal method of interpretation through which the poetic character of the Hebrew psalter is treated inadequately and the poet' s intentions could even be missed altogether. 17 Instead he suggests an intemal approach to the biblical text, viz., the Hebrew psalter which would emphasize the primary role of the text itself in the method of interpretation, accepting as its tools literary and philological criticism (1986). While we appreciate the criticisms against the traditional form-critical method (and agree with these to a certain extent), we would nevertheless like to balance Weiss's strong literary approach for the sake of the historicity of the biblical text which may be neglected by a one-sided literary method. 18 A more syntactical approach representative of recent tendencies in the exegesis ofthe Hebrew psalter has been taken by W. Groß (1975), although his syntax of Hebrew poetry is only one aspect of psalms exegesis and has
15 Ridderbos sees his approach strongly influenced by the works of M. Buher and F. Rosenzweig on the one band, and the "Neue Stilistik" on the other. Seybold levies the usual criticism against the Jiterary approach to biblical texts: "So bleibt sie [stylecriticism] trotz aller Bemühung an der Letztphase der Texts, d.h. an der Psalterform hängen und hält an der aufs Ganze kaum haltbaren These fest, daß Psalmen wie Gedichte fast schulmäßig und zudem aus einem Guß entstanden sind" (1981 :8).
16 Ridderbos demonstrates his stylistic approach in applying it to Psa 1-41. For a summary ofhis study, see Seybold (1981:7).
17 "Such a non-Jiterary, even anti-literary notion of interpretation finds füll expression in the method of study which Gunkel developed: form criticism, still the dominant mode of Biblical research. Form criticism is an external approach to the Biblical text, which treats the text as an historical datum rather than a Jiterary work of art" (Weiss, 1986:54). He continues to attack the form-critical school from various angles, at times with somewhat sweeping statements.
18 Weiss, however, seemingly does not intend to abandon historical questions altogether: "We do not, therefore, oppose the historical study of Jiterary works; what we object to is the historical-critical tendency to reduce works of literature to mere 'documents'. We would insist that, whatever the ultimate goal of interpretation might be, a poem must be apprehended jirst of all [his italics] as an artistic creation, on the basis of an interpretation which illuminates it from within, as poetic form" (1986:66). Weiss continues, defending the method of Total Interpretation with regard to text critical considerations.

not such far-reaching consequences as the above-mentioned positions. After reviewing the discussion on Hebrew syntax, Groß develops his syntactical methodology with reference to the identification and translation of wayyiqtol forms. 19 Although this study bypasses the dichotic positions of the above-mentioned approaches, it nevertheless delineates an important aspect of the interpretation of the Hebrew psalter, and has to be integrated more on the literary side of the spectrum. Another important aspect of the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter which is also represented to some degree in this study is the comparative method in psalms research. Although psalms exegesis has been indebted to the study of the ancient Near East from early stages,20 only with the arrival of the textual evidence discovered at Ras Shamra/Ugarit has the comparative approach to the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter become a category in its own right.21 Climactic for this approach has been the appearance of M. Dahood's three-volume commentary on the psalms in the Anchor Bible series (1966; 1968; 1970).22 Dahood's opus magnum is characterized by a thorough treatment of almost the entire vocabulary23 of the Hebrew psalter against the background of Ugaritic poetic literature, at times producing rather new and unfamiliar renderings of individual psalms. Although its first appearance was greeted with enthusiasm in academic circles, cautious voices soon expressed increasing skepticism against the work. Sauer, in 1974, still wrote: "Die Psalmenexegese kann in Zukunft nicht hinter diese Erkenntnisse [as expressed in Dahood's commentary] zurück. Wissenschaftsgeschichtlich ist eine Zäsur gegeben, die nicht nach rückwärts überschritten werden kann" (406).24 However, in response to the

21 "Es bedarf keines Nachweises mehr, daß die literarischen [his italics] Funde von Ras Shamra / Ugarit in besonderer Weise für die poetische [his italics] Literatur des Alten Testaments von Bedeutung sind" (Sauer, 1974:401).
22 Work on the commentary has been preceded by various notes and articles on the subject; cf. Sauer for a bibliography ofearlier studies by Dahood (Sauer, 1974:401, n. 2). 23 Sauer calculates an average ofapproximately 12% verses without comment (1974:401).
24 Four years later, Sauer critically evaluates the commentary with regard to the categories mentioned in the grammar ofthe Hebrew psalter added to the third volume ofDahood's commentary (orthography, phonetics, pronomina, nouns, verbs, prepositions, syntax, and parallel word-pairs), and comes to the following, more careful conclusion: "... ein immenses ingeniös gearbeitetes Werk liegt vor, das virtuos unglaublich viel Material zu verarbeiten weiß. Das Vorgehen des Verfassers ist aber oft rein assoziativ. Für Dahood ist Textkritik, und damit der wesentlichste Teil seiner Auslegung, mehr eine Kunst als eine Wissenschaft" (1978:385f.).

exclusive philological approach of Dahood, the following criticisms have been advanced: (1) Dahood has decidedly disregarded the Massoretic vocalization of the biblical texts (1966:xxii), and although he adheres strictly to the consonantal text, his word-divisions and vocalizations occasionally seem arbitrary and biased toward the Ugaritic textual evidence.25 (2) The change of meaning of a Hebrew root on account of its Ugaritic counterpart is not a necessary choice, and presupposes a direct and evolutionary view of the linguistic-historical development from Ugaritic to Hebrew (Craigie, 1983:53). (3) The main reservations with regard to Dahood's commentary are the goveming criteria of any comparative approach, such as chronology, geography, literary forms, etc. Although there is wide agreement that one can compare Ugaritic with Hebrew poetic literature, Dahood seems to practise the comparison too freely, almost presupposing a one-to-one relationship, or even a superiority of the Ugaritic evidence over the Hebrew texts (Craigie, 1983:53).26 0. Loretz (e.g., 1979; 1988; 1990), a student of M. Dahood, also follows the Ugaritic approach to the psalms, especially from the viewpoint of Kolometrie,21 exploring the Canaanite parallels to the Hebrew psalter. However, it is important to differentiate his position from that of Dahood. While Dahood opts for an early dating of the Hebrew psalter in order to bridge the gap between Ugarit and Israel, Loretz accepts an exilic or postexilic redaction for the present form of the psalms. In his opinion, the main contribution that the Ugaritic texts have made for the study of the Hebrew psalter lies in the realm of metrics (1988:8), and not in comparative philology motivated by theological considerations.28 Along the same line, a
III to the criticism advanced against the first two volumes of his work, yet continued to emphasize the justification of using Ugaritic texts to elucidate the Hebrew psalter, since the time gap between Ugaritic and Hebrew psalms literature is, according to him, not as wide as his critics pointed out. According to Dahood, the Ugaritic texts are from the period of ca. 1375-1195 B.C., while the oldest biblical poems can be dated between 1250-1100 B.C., with the majority of them originating in the time from 1000-539 B.C. (Dahood, 1970:xxii-xxv).

student ofLoretz and J. C. de Moor, M. C. A. Korpel has published a study about Ugaritic and Hebrew description of the Divine in which she takes the results of modern metaphor theory into consideration (1990).29 Fundamental to Korpel's approach30 is the notion that Ugaritic is directly compatible to the Hebrew of the biblical texts, inasmuch as she even consciously bypasses the diachronic question.31 Besides the textual comparative approach to the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter, the iconographic study of the psalms has gained a growing influence on biblical exegesis. According to 0. Keel, one of the main proponents and prominent applicants of this approach, the relationship between the biblical text and ancient Near Eastem iconography is as follows: "The relationship between the Bible and iconography is here understood as the influence ofthe contemporaneous art on the biblical texts in Israel itself ... and in the neighboring countries..." (1992:358). Tue type of comparison endeavored is not as much historical in the sense of illustrating the biblical texts, but rather lies in the realm of concepts and ideas.32 The biblical text, and especially the Hebrew psalter with its rieb imagery, lends itself to such a kind of study, and Keel has opened up this vista of psalms exegesis with bis widely read Die Welt der altorientalischen
zum Verständnis der hebr. Poesie bisher unbeachtet. Die bis jetzt postulierten Parallelen zwischen den Ugarit-Texten und den Psalmen sind deshalb m.E. einer Überprüfung zu unterziehen und auf die Tragfähigkeit ihres Fundamentes hin zu untersuchen. Entgegen den seit langem und mit Energie erhobenen Vorwürfen gegen die sog. vor-ugaritische Psalmenauslegung dürfte bei der Suche nach den Beziehungen zwischen den UgaritTexten und Psalmen die Frage zu stellen sein, ob bisher nicht die Parallelen-Hascherei im Vordergrund gestanden ist, und aufgrund theologischer Vor-Urteile nicht gerade der wesentliche Beitrag der Ugarit-Texte zu einem neuen Verständnis der Psalmen, der in der Einsicht in die kanaanäische 'Metrik' besteht, ungebührlich verdrängt worden ist und nur insoweit zu Worte kam, als dies dem Bestreben dienlich war, eine vorexilische Datierung der Psalmen zu postulieren" (1988:8).

31 "What we aim at is the comparison ofthe religious language ofUgarit with that ofthe Old Testament as a whole in its final canonical wording.... Because of the prevalent scholarly dissent with regard to the dating of almost every part of the Old Testament, it is unfeasible to draw up a study like this according to any rigorous diachronic plan. Although matters of dating will occasionally be touched upon, the main emphasis will be on synchronic, linguistic and religious comparison" (Korpel, 1990:79).
32 "The attempted comparison is that of thought with thought, and pictures are only one type ofevidence, while words are another'' (Keel, 1993:3:372).

Bildsymbolik und das Alte Testament. Am Beispiel der Psalmen (1972)33 in which he tried to attempt a "systematic comparison of ideas about the world, the temple, the king, etc. found in the psalms, with concepts represented in ANE art, identifying points of contact and divergence" (Keel, 1992:372). Although the study represents an early stage in the development of recent iconographic studies and also of Keel's own perspective on the issue,34 it nevertheless demonstrates the possibilities of iconography in biblical exegesis. Tue iconographic comparative approach also constitutes an important aspect of the present study. After having thus identified the various tendencies in, and approaches to, the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter, we will conclude this section by presenting a synoptic table of the most prominent and recent commentaries on the psalms and their respective working methods underlying their exegetical procedures.35

33 The title was perhaps chosen a little bit too boldly, since the study marked only the beginnings of iconographic research and its impact on biblical studies. Nevertheless, it has positively influenced the circulation ofthis important work.
34 If one compares the introduction to the Altorientalische Bildsymbolik with his article on iconography in the ABD, one can see a definite development toward a more clarified methodology of the iconographic approach. Cf. also his Methodenschema in Das Recht der Bilder gesehen zu werden (1992:267-273).
35 Obviously, there will be some degree of over-simplification with regard to the working methods of the various commentaries, since they often subscribe to more than one approach which is reflected in the filling in ofmore than one ofthe appropriate columns. The order is in accordance with the date of publication. The following sigla are

36 Central to Weiser's approach is the covenant ideology interpretation which nevertheless is a variation on Mowinckel's theme (see discussion above). 37 Volume 1 and 2 are numbered consecutively.
38 Tue first to the fourth edition of Kraus's commentary were still in the tradition of Gunkel's approach; see discussion above. 39 Volume 1 and 2 are numbered consecutively.

40 Eaton subscribes to the cultic view of the psalms with a royal interpretation of the majority of individual psalms (1967:20). ·
41 Anderson seems to try to accommodate all directions of psalms exegesis, while he sees no drastically conflicting differences between the views of Gunkel, Mowinckel, Weiser, Kraus, and Westermann which could not be consolidated into one overall system (1972:30f.). 42 Volume I and 2 are numbered consecutively.
43 Kidner is not altogether clear on his approach to the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter. After having summarized the various views, he emphasizes the concept of actualization (relecture?) of the psalms in Israelite worship. Furthermore, he acknowledges the importance of the headings for the interpretation of the psalms, and points out the fallacies ofthe comparative religion approach to the Hebrew psalter (1973a:14-18). In his somewhat metaphorical conclusion he expresses his skepticism against an exclusively liturgical interpretation of the psalms: "... the Psalter, taken on its own terms, is not so much a liturgical library, storing up standard literature for cultic requirements, as a hospitable house, weil lived in, where most things can be found and borrowed after some searching and whose first occupants have left on it everywhere the imprint oftheir experiences and the stamp oftheir characters" (1973a:18).
44 The commentary is divided into two volumes of which the pages are numbered consecutively.
45 Although Beaucamp sees the Hebrew psalter as a witness of the liturgy in Israelite cult, i.e., the "recueil des chants liturgiques d'Israel" (1976:11), he prefers to focus on the usage and reuse of a psalm instead of determining a hypothetical original author and his intentions: "Ajoutons pour conclure que l'origine d'une piece liturgique compte moins
que son utilisation. II est plus utile ici de determiner aquoi eile a servi, que de tenter de
decouvrir ce qu'elle avait d'abord primitivement signifie. Son sens profond n'est pas a
chercher dans les intentions d'un hypothetique auteur; il n'est autre que celui qu'a consacre l'usage, celui que la tradition a conserve" (1976:13). Nevertheless, Beaucamp sees the formation of the Hebrew psalter according to the threefold religious-historical development from the beginnings of the monarchy via the reforms of Josiah to postexilic times, while the written tradition of the psalms can only be attributed to the time after the exile. His emphasis, however, lies in the realm ofthe relecture ofthe psalms.
46 lt appeared necessary to also include the fifth edition of Kraus's commentary on the psalms, since it has substantially been altered in comparison to the first four editions (see discussion above). The indicated presence of the form-critical method in parenthesis points to Kraus's modified position where he introduces his own formgroups, but tries to make a contribution on a literary-historical level (1978a:49).

However, the practical application in the exegetical part of the commentary is unfortunately inconsistent with bis methodological concept, and at times reiterates traditional form-critical analysis (Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993:18). 47 Volume 1 and 2 are numbered consecutively.
48 Above we have pointed out the differences between Loretz's and Dahood's approaches which may not come out clearly in this table.
49 After giving an introduction of the main tendencies in modern psalms research, Craigie describes the methodological concept of bis commentary as follows: "While it [the first volume ofthe WBC commentary on the psalms] is influenced to some extent by all the perspectives presented above, it does not stand consciously in any of the particular schools or traditions which have been summarized. I have followed the broad principles of form-criticism set down by Gunkel, at least insofar as I have recognized the importance of attempting to classify psalms according to their type and to set them in particular life situations" (1983:47). Nevertheless, Craigie also wants to balance formcritical examination against literary analysis inspired by Ridderbos's "new stylistics" (see discussion above). Finally, the Ugaritic evidence from the perspective ofDahood's contributions is also taken into consideration, though in a moderate manner (1983:48).
so Tate follows bis two predecessors of the WBC psalms commentary, referring to the introduction to the first volume by Craigie (Tate, 1990:xxiv). si Allen also follows Craigie as a methodological guideline in bis working method.
s2 Unfortunately, this commentary is not available in South Africa. For an evaluation we bad to depend on the abstract provided by OTA. The work was nevertheless included in our !ist, since it represents a more recent commentary that also includes iconographic comparative material: "Each psalm is presented by R. [Ringgren] according to a fourpart format: Swedish translation, notes (here he discusses individual words along with textual and translation issues), analysis (this segment treats especially of [sie] the psalm's literary form and structure, but also of, e.g., its extra-biblical parallels and NT utilization), and exegesis, elucidating the meaning ofthe psalm's component units. The work's value is further enhanced by a number of illustrations drawn from ancient Near Eastem iconography exemplifying particular formulations or images of the psalms..." (Begg, 1990:314):
s3 Hossfeld and Zenger aptly summarize Gerstenberger's stand within the form-critical tradition which is influenced by a more sociological approach concentrating on the lament psalms: "E. S. Gerstenberger hat durch Beziehung altorientalischer Parallelen den 'Sitz im Leben' der Klagelieder vor allem im Bereich der familiären Frömmigkeit zu erhellen versucht" (Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993: 18).
s4 Although van Gemeren claims to take form-critical categories into consideration, bis emphasis lies on the literary aspect of psalms exegesis, as can be seen from this

Table 4: Synopsis ofcommentaries on the Hebrew-psa/ter
While most of the modern commentaries still take Gunkel's form-critical method as the point of departure, there has been the distinct expression of discontent with bis approach, and some commentaries have already implemented this in various ways with differing results.57 lt is interesting to note that commentators, though voicing their criticisms against formcriticism, rarely dare to depart explicitly from Gunkel's methodical scheme, but rather try to integrate the form-critical method into an overall approach
programmatic statement in his introduction: "In approaching the Psalms I am much less inclined to look for the 'functional' element, i.e., how the psalm functioned in ancient Israel. I am also skeptical ofunderstanding the Psalms in the light ofUgaritic studies. In my opinion the expositor is at risk when he explains the text in the context of historical referentiality, liturgy, or cultic Sitz-im-Leben [his italics]" (1991:14).
55 After expressing substantial reservations about the form-critical method, Hossfeld and Zenger proceed to list the influencing factors and exegetical approaches that are reflected in their commentary on the psalms: (1) literary analysis (poetologische Analyse) along the lines of M. Weiss, L. Alonso-Schökel, N. H. Ridderbos, et al. (see discussion above); (2) anthological psalms exegesis under the dominant influence of French scholars with their principle of relecture, i.e., re-working of the psalms under the perspective of post-exilic wisdom schools; Hossfeld and Zenger acknowledge however the danger of a general late dating of psalms; (3) a more differentiated perspective on individual psalms taking literary-critical, tradition-historical, and religious-historical aspects into consideration; this would lead to a more moderate approach to the particular psalm, recognizing its individuality and uniqueness as an expression of the religious history oflsrael without trying to make it fit into a certain Gattung; (4) the study ofthe Hebrew psalter as a whole and the inner dynamics of the collection of the psalms, i.e., the redaction-historical and canonical aspects of psalms research; (5) a receptionhistorical analysis on three levels: inner-biblical, rabbinical and talmudic Judaism, and Christian reception (Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993:17-25).
56 Seybold's commentary replaces the somewhat outdated one by Schmidt (1934) in the same series. lt represents a step away from the traditional form-critical approach, trying to further the appreciation of the correlation between the linguistic form and theological content in the individual psalms considered for themselves. Especially his textual notes, drawn from his familiarity with materials from the Judaean desert, are of great value in the interpretation.
57 Considering the table of prominent psalms commentaries one notices a lack of an iconographic comparative approach to the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter. Only Ringgren's commentary provides iconographic material. A psalms commentary with an iconographic perspective appears to be a desideratum among modern psalms · commentaries. Keel's Bildsymbolik has certainly been a step in the right direction, but it is not designed as a commentary and cannot function as such.

without realizing at times conflicting axioms of the theoretical foundations underlying their exegetical work.sB
4.1.2. Exegetical Approach
lt appears that the form-critical method, though still predominant in its usage, needs to be received with substantial reservation, since its historical development only seems to have lead to the proposal of further divisions and subdivisions within the major Gattungen laid down by Gunkel at the beginning of the century.s9 Therefore, for the present study, we see only limited value in the application of the form-critical approach to the understanding of the warrior and the God of heaven metaphors in the Hebrew psalter. The criticisms of Kraus,60 Hossfeld and Zenger, et al. are valid enough to take the step out of the traditional line of form-critical exegetical work on the psalms. During the exegetical process, the uniqueness of the individual psalm should not be abandoned for the sake of a rigid formal structure. We would agree with Hossfeld and Zenger in a final criticism advanced against the form-critical method which nevertheless addresses the core of the matter: Die gattungskritisch dominierte Psalmenexegese läuft Gefahr, den konkreten Psalm, insbesondere sein individuelles sprachliches und theologisches Profil, zu nivellieren. Bisweilen gewinnt man in Kommentaren den Eindruck, es komme beim Verstehen und im Nachvollzug von Psalmen weniger auf die Semantik als auf die "Gattung" an (1993:19). Understanding the 'semantics' of a psalm, i.e., its inner components and their relation to each other, therefore comes closer to the object of the present study which would shift the exegetical emphasis more toward a literary analysis approach.61 However, the problematic aspects of the
SB A Iiterary analytical approach in its consequent application is not easily reconcilable with a thorough form-critical analysis of the psalm, unless one addresses the exegetical task in a rather departmentalized manner.
s9 Hossfeld and Zenger quote R. Smend's introduction to the OT: "Es gibt hier einen formund gattungsgeschichtlichen 'Perfektionismus, der zur Sisyphusarbeit immer weiterer Differenzierung innerhalb und außerhalb der unzweifelhaften großen Gattungen führt... "' (Smend apud Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993: 19).
60 lt would be interesting to see Kraus's altered position being applied more consistently in his commentary, but perhaps one has to await another, i.e., the sixth edition of BKAT 15.
61 Cf, e.g., Weiss, a strong proponent ofthis exegetical approach and his method of Total Interpretation. He stresses the difference between a form-critical and an internal Iiterary interpretation of a specific poem: "The basic principle of Total Interpretation, as opposed to form criticism, is that the interpretation of poetry is not concerned with external aspects, e.g., genre, Sitz im Leben, Sitz im Kultus [his italics], or pattern, not with what a particular idiom or motif generally [his italics] signifies. The interpreter of

literary method with its occasionally ahistorical notion, and its predominant concem with the final text at the expense of historical exegesis, are noted. Yet, the literary analysis seems be more flexible in accommodating the various features of an individual psalm without forcibly imposing a superstructure, all the while taking into consideration the distinct character of Hebrew poetry.62 The most promising approach to the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter, in our view, lies in the comparative method, while comparative is understood in the widest sense of the term. The contribution of Dahood has demonstrated the possibilities, but also the fallacies of this methodology, as has been discussed above. Comparative can be on both the philological and iconographic levels, two integral components of this study, while philological comparison itself can be subdivided into inner-biblical and extra-biblical comparison.63 The first category of comparison is the innerbiblical philological exegesis of the texts of concem for this study. Therefore, one could term the exegetical method of this study, an innerbiblical comparative historical-philological approach. We follow with this procedure the valid claims made by Talmon (1977) which will be discussed in the introduction to chapter 5.64 The questions involved in the exegetical process are of classical exegesis: text, translation, historical and literary context, genre, structure, grammar, lexical analysis, biblical context, etc. (Stuart, 1992:682-688; Deist and Burden, 1980). The chronological context for the intemal-exegetical comparison will be the literature of the Old Testament, since we accept a broad range of dating for the various psalms from a historical-philological perspective.65 lt is the purpose of this category of comparison to understand the respective biblical metaphors of God within their biblical immediate and wider context.
poetry must concem himself only with intemal aspects, i.e., with what the poet has made of the raw material in the particular poem under consideration" (1984:63). However, with respect to the historical and philological aspects of a poem, he then qualifies his statement and ascertains his support of the historical research: "We do not, therefore, oppose the historical study of literary works; what we object to is the historical-critical tendency to reduce works ofliterature to mere 'documents"' (Weiss, 1984:66). 62 Cf. the discussion of Hebrew poetry below.
63 Korpel (1990) has substantially contributed to the extra-biblical philological comparison, and reference to her work will be made where necessary.
64 Talmon demonstrated "the need for a definition of the proper procedure to be followed in the comparative philological study ofbiblical texts and to adduce prooffor the maxim that the inner-biblical analysis always should precede the comparison with extra-biblical texts" (1977:347). 65 See discussion on the dating ofthe psalms below.

4.2. EXCURSUS: THE LANGUAGE OF THE PSALMS
The recognition of the specific genre of literature has become an increasingly important tool in approaching any type of text. In the following, attention will be given to the medium through which the genres of literature we will encounter in our discussion of the warrior and God of heaven metaphors in the psalms are communicated, i.e., the language of verse.
4.2.1. The Nature ofHebrew Verse
The study of Hebrew verse66 has been the subject of much scholarly interest for the last three centuries, since Bishop R. Lowth67 in 1753 defined parallelism as "the correspondence of one Verse, or Line, with another" (Lowth apud Berlin, 1992:155), and distinguished between synonymous, antithetical, and synthetic parallelism.68 Only with the beginning of the 1980s could a noticeable different approach be identified. Coming from the realm of literary studies, R. Alter's The Art ofBiblical Poetry (1985) and J. L. Kugel's The Idea of Biblical Poetry (1981) enhanced the understanding of biblical verse, especially with regard to the parallelismus membrorum, emphasizing the continuity or consequentiality of parallel lines, instead of their synonymy (Berlin, 1992:155). From a comparative perspective, the discovery of the Ugaritic poetic texts has provided an impetus to the study of verse, especially of word-pairs.69 W. G. E. Watson's Classical Hebrew Poetry (1984) presented a useful guide to the various techniques of biblical
66 Cloete correctly points out the difficulties in terminology, i.e., using prose vs. poetry as an opposing word-pair: "The proper opposite of prose is verse, for which unfortunately the word poetry is often used as a synonym. The word poetry, properly used, implies some judgment of quality and/or substance, whereas the terms prose and verse do not, but refer only to form" (1988:10). In accordance with these terminological guidelines, preference will be given to the term 'verse' over 'poetry'.
67 His work De sacra poesi Hebraeorum (1753) can be seen as the initial groundwork for the study of Hebrew verse, and his definition still remains classic, although it has to be qualified in accordance with modern studies of Hebrew verse.
68 lt is not the purpose of this study to provide a historical survey of studies on Hebrew verse. Fora detailed historical presentation, one may turn to Kugel (1981).
69 Berlin expresses a note of criticism on this particular aspect of poetic research: "Many scholars saw in word pairs the essence of parallelism, the sine qua non without which parallel lines could not exist. Furthermore, it was suggested, these pairs formed a kind of 'poet's dictionary' - a poetic substratum on which poets might draw in order to compose parallelism. These conclusions reflect the fact that the impetus for the study of wordpairs was intimately bound up with theories of oral composition, unproved and unprovable at least for biblical poetry" (1992:157).

verse, also including comparative material from Akkadian and Ugaritic sources.70 More recent models for Hebrew verse have been suggested by linguistic scholars, stressing the grammatical, lexical, semantic, syntactic, and phonological aspects of Hebrew verse.71 lt is important to note that biblical verse cannot be considered as an ancient equivalent to modern Western verse, and therefore cannot be evaluated along the same lines. Furthermore, it has to be stressed that the line between Hebrew prose and verse is not as distinct as in modern Western languages. lt would therefore be more appropriate to speak of a Hebrew high or elevated style, instead of . biblical verse.72 In order to determine some sort of boundary line, dividing Hebrew prose from verse, one has to come to the modest recognition of very limited criteria. Even the presence of parallelism, the traditional marker of Hebrew verse, does not suffice for a clear identification of verse, since it also appears in Hebrew prose (Cloete, 1988: 12). One of the more viable rules for the differentiation between prose and verse seems to be the recognition of lines, and Cloete comes to the conclusion: "The lines or cola, then, are the distinguishing characteristic of verse, and they in turn are describable in terms of a versification system" (1988: 13).73
4.2.2. Hebrew Verse and the Dating ofTexts
A recent trend in the literary study of the Bible, has been the notion to analyze the text in its final redaction stage, while questions of date and origin are considered to be of secondary importance and of no bearing to the literary work done on the texts. Tue book of psalms has presented itself as an ideal object for this approach on account of two reasons: (1) the complicated and to some extent unclear history of its composition; and (2)
7° Cf. also his recent article in which he responds to the various criticisms advanced
against his work, summarizing the recent developments in the research of Hebrew verse (Watson, 1993:372-384). 71 For relevant Jiterature, see Berlin (1992:157-160) and LaSor (1979-88a:897f.).
72 "The concept of 'poetry' is due to recognition of an elevated style which does not conform to classical or westem ideas ofpoetry, and it is therefore possible for an author to move from the more mundane ('prose') to the loftier style ('poetry'), or even somewhere in between, in the same composition" (LaSor, 1979-88a:898). Cf. also Kugel (1981:302). However, in order to avoid unnecessary confusion, we will continue to employ the term 'Hebrew verse'.
73 Cloete, however, is cautious in admitting that "the Jineation or colometry is not easily obtainable from the the [sie] text" (1988:13) which again leaves one with a degree of non-satisfaction in the quest for Hebrew verse.



54 4. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS GOD OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER
the poetic language employed by the psalmists.74 However, there are also voices which ascribe a certain level of historicity to the book of psalms, trying to correlate the structures of biblical poetic language with chronological developments. F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman pioneered this approach in their joint dissertation submitted to the Johns Hopkins University in 1950, Studies in Ancient Yahwistic Poetry (1975). The two authors studied four poetic passages75 from various parts of the Bible, and compared them to the epigraphic evidence from the early development of Northwest Semitic languages. Although this work has to be viewed as a product of its time,76 the general working hypothesis was that there were some criteria according to which one could identify early Israelite verse.77 Robertson's Linguistic Evidence in Dating Early Hebrew Poetry (1972) ascribed only the poem in Exo 15 unequivocally to the early period of lsraelite literature (1972:155). More recently, Freedman has attempted a sequence dating78 of a group of Hebrew poems, and arrived at a period of time spanning the 12th to the 10th century B.C. (1977: 18).79 He contends that the poetic material of the Bible "is older and more basic than the prose materials" (1977:5).
74 As representative ofthis view R. Alter's The Literary Guide to the Bible (1987) may be taken. There is also an interesting article by A. M. Cooper who studies the Davidic psalms and their possible historical interpretation from a historical exegetical perspective and comes to the following conclusion: "We are left ... with only two sensible and productive ways of reading [the psalms]: 1) reading in a strictly canonical context, and 2) reading from an ahistorical or literary-critical point ofview" (1983:130). He then opts for the latter view: "Let the text assume a timeless existence somewhere between the author and the reader.... Tue text, severed from its historical moorings, will cooperate with us and enrich us ifwe allow it to" (1983:131). Fora summary on the change of approach toward the literary text, see Weiss (1984: 1-46) who is a proponent ofthe method of Total Interpretation.
75 The Blessing of Jacob (Gen 49), the Song of Miriam (Exo 15), the Blessing of Moses
(Deu 33), and a Royal Song ofThanksgiving (Psa 18 = 2Sa 22).
76 Cf. especially in this regard the postscript of the authors that appeared with the reissue ofthe dissertation in 1975.
77 Cross and Freedman worked on orthography, and particularly on the metrical structure ofthe poems, pointing out that "an unbalanced meter (e.g., the Qinah meter isolated by Budde, 3:2) does not appear in ancient Israelite poetry" (1975:9).
78 Cf. also the sequence dating of Albright who ascribes Psa 78, 68, and 72 to the tenth century B.C. (Albright apud Freedman, 1980:77f.). His main criteria was the use of repetitive criteria: "Albright was able to discem a pattem in early Hebrew poems exhibiting a gradual decline in the use of repetitive parallelism with a corresponding increase in the use ofparonomasia" (Freedman, 1980:77).
79 Tue poems under consideration were: the Testament of Jacob (Gen 49), the Song ofthe Sea (Exo 15), the Oracles of Balaam (Num 23-24), the Song of Moses (Deu 32), the Blessing ofMoses (Deu 33), and the Song ofDeborah (Judges 5).

However, one has to qualify this statement in consideration of the fact that the poetic text under discussion is mainly found imbedded in prose narrations, and does not originate in an altogether poetical body of literature such as the book of psalms. What can nevertheless be ascertained is the fact that there are criteria of phonology, morphology, grammar, metric structure, etc., that can serve as evidence for the early origin of a poetic text (Watson, 1984:35-41). Bach individual case will have to be considered carefully, acknowledging the possibility of at least a relative dating of the texts discussed in the present study. lt is interesting to note that all the attempts to classify Hebrew verse work from the basic principle of the comparative approach, i.e., to date Hebrew verse according to similarities in the verse of cognate Semitic languages, especially Ugaritic and Akkadian. Although there may be methodological issues involved in such a comparison80 - which will be addressed in the introduction to the chapter six - the basic notion of this approach seems to be valuable. However, it must be kept in mind that this study does not focus on the dating of the psalms under discussion.
4.3. THE TEXTS
The prominent issues and problems in the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter have now been sufficiently identified in order to establish a way in which to approach the texts themselves. In the following we will motivate the selection of relevant texts for this part of the study after which each text or text unit will be investigated.
4.3 .1. Motivation for the Selection of Texts
The survey presented in chapter 3 has yielded 41 occurrences for the warrior and 93 occurrences for the God of heaven metaphor. These occurrences are diversified and at times appear disconnected in a single
80 There seems to be a lack of clarity with respect to the criteria employed in determining the antiquity of a poem. Freedman works from the assumption of the early uses of "divine names and epithets and certain other key terms [?]", coming to the conclusion "that we can distinguish three major phases during the period from the twelfth through the tenth-ninth centuries B.C." (1980:107). Especially the use of the divine name Yahweh is taken as an indicator for the archaic character of the poems Freedman discusses (1980:120). For a chronological table, comparing the dating of Albright, Robertson, and Freedman, see Freedman (1980:118). As for the psalms, Freedman assigns Psa 29 to the 12th, Psa 18 to the 10th, and Psa 68, 72, 78 to the 1019th centuries B.C.



56 4. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER
verse or even just in allusive form. lt therefore appears advisable to make a judicious selection of texts that are suitable for the intemal-comparative part of the study. The criteria for the selection are as follows: (1) The respective metaphor must occur within the context of the same metaphor, i.e., the occurrence must be part of a larger unit in which the metaphor is represented, forming a cluster of texts in which the metaphor is the main theme.81 The psalms in which the respective metaphor quantitatively occurred the most were naturally considered with preference. (2) Since we are dealing with two metaphors, and since one of the working hypotheses of the present study is that there is the possibility of an interrelation between these two metaphors, i.e., the warrior and the God of heaven metaphor, overlapping occurrences that share the two metaphors will be included and approached with special consideration. (3) While it is endeavored to select texts that represent the traditional fivefold division ofthe Hebrew psalter, the majority ofthe chosen passages come from the first two books, a fact which corresponds to the results of the statistical survey done in chapter 3.82 The list of texts that will be discussed in this part of the study reads as follows: (i) Texts representing the God ofheaven metaphor: Psa 29 and Psa 65. (ii) Texts representing the warrior metaphor: Psa 21 and Psa 46. (iii) Texts representing both metaphors in an overlapping fashion: Psa 18; Psa 68; Psa 83; and Psa 144. The selection of texts is an attempt to provide a representative choice with regard to the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, especially from the perspective of their relationship with each other. lt is, however, a presumptuous undertaking to do a thorough exegesis on eight psalms within the confines of this part of the study, leading to the pragmatic approach of concentrating on the relevant texts, viz., passages within the respective psalms that deal with our metaphors. In selecting these passages we have focused primarily on the metaphor action, i.e., descriptions of God acting as the God ofheaven or as a warrior.
81 As has been observed earlier, this procedure goes beyond the identification of applicable terms as observed by Brettler with regard to the warrior metaphor: "In determining whether a particular context presupposes the metaphor of YHWH as warrior, it is not sufficient to look for epithets such as ,,:::ii, 'warrior' or .ion'?o t!i•~, 'man of war', since a metaphor may be presupposed without its central term appearing explicitly..." (1993: 138).
82 Three of the selected occurrences come from book 1 (Psa 18; 21; and 29); three come from book 2 (Psa 46; 65; and 68); one comes from book 3 (Psa 83); and I from book 5 (Psa 144). Note that book 4 is not represented in the selection.

4.3.2. Psalm 18:8-16
Psa 18 belongs to the group of texts which represent both the warrior and the God of heaven metaphors. Especially the theophanic passage in verses 8 to 16 is of principal interest for the concem of the present study.83Since Psa 18 presents an interesting transmission history, it has been the subject of various studies. 84 While it is not possible to give a comprehensive treatment of all the issues involved in the interpretation of Psa 18, we will focus on the aspects that are of importance to the present study.85 A translation of the passage follows below, pointing out the various textcritical problern issues of the text.86

83 As mentioned above we will limit our exegetical considerations to the given passage
witbin Psalm 18. Nevertbeless, we will endeavor to integrate the pericope into tbe context oftbe psalm as a wbole.
84 On account of its parallel cbaracter to 2Sa 22, Psa 18 represents a field day for every student of textual criticism. Besides tbe prevalent commentaries, various articles (Couroyer, 1986:38-69; Cross and Freedman, 1953:16-34; Freedman, 1976:55-107; Hossfeld, 1986:171-190; Hunter, 1989:97-107; Kuntz, 1983:3-31; Rüterswörden, l 988:247-263) and even monograpbs or significant parts of monograpbs (Scbmuttermayr, 1984; Cross and Freedman, 1975) bave been devoted to tbe study of Psa 18 wbile the text-critical aspect of tbe text bas been the predominant momentum bebind the study ofthis psalm.
85 Althougb Psa 18 is a somewbat 'bot iron' in the exegesis of the Hebrew psalter, we found it nevertbeless important to include it in our considerations, since botb tbe metapbors under question are represented. Brettler excludes Psa 18 in bis study on Images of YHWH the Warrior in the Psalms (1993:139) because it is "too long" wbicb does not seem to be sufficient reason for tbe omission of the psalm, even if it is anthologized in Psa 144 as Brettler adduces (1993:139).
86 Tbe translation is designed to be close to tbe text provided in BHS. Tbis will at times produce a Jess elegant style.

Baumgartner, 1985:331). The explicative character of the expression may point to its glossary function.
91 Tue usage of the :i instead of o as a directional preposition is interesting and denotes, according to Cross and Freedman, the archaic character ofthe poem (1953:24).
92 The verb form ',::,~n qualifies U:i~ in an attributive manner. One could translate 'devouring fire'. Note also the change from perf. to impf. in the verbal forms which does not seem to conform to a certain scheme, since it goes back to perf. in the following form (cf. Schmuttermayr, 1971 :24). 93 Tue critical apparatus ofthe BHS evaluates this phrase as a possible gloss. 94 Also: 'cloud' or 'heavy/dark cloud'.
95 Cf. Schmuttermayr's discussion of the verb :i::i, in which he differentiates between the two main meanings 'to ride' and 'to mount, ascend', favouring the latter for comparative reasons (1971 :66).
96 Some mss from the Cairo Geniza and 2Sa 22: 11 read the Niphal form ~,,, 'he was seen' instead of ~,,, from the root ;,~, 'to fly fast, fly swiftly, dart through the air'. MT should be given preference in this case, since it is somewhat more in line with the other verbal forms ofthe text (cf. Barthelemy, Hulst, Lohfink, et al., 1979:186).
97 The Cairo Geniza mss read nn;, which does not alter the meaning of the texts
significantly. Dahood discards the MT and vocalizes differently: nn 'space, interval' (cf. Gen 32:17; Es 4:14), translating 'on wings outstretched'.
98 Two mss, the LXX, the Targumim, and the parallel text in 2Sa 22:12 add the 1consecutivum. Schmuttermayr comments on the quantitative usage of the 1 at the beginning of a line in 2Sa 22 and Psa 18: "In 16 Fällen unterscheiden sich aber beide Fassungen: Achtmal liest 2 Sm die Konjunktion, während die Psa-Rezension sie nicht überliefert, und in den anderen acht Fällen läßt sie die 2 Sm-Fassung gegen die PsaRezension aus" (1971 :25). For the time aspect ofthe verb indicated by the 1 he comes to the following conclusion: "So läßt sich schließlich für unseren alten Text - vornehmlich aus dem Vergleich seiner beiden Überlieferungen, deren eine an verschiedenen Stellen 'impf. cons.' bietet, während die andere 'bloßes Impf.' führt - der Schluß ziehen, es könne keinesfalls an der Konjunktion liegen, ob die Form im 'Impf.' als Vergangenheit
zu verstehen ist" (1971:27). Therefore, the usage of the , in Psa 18, viz., 2Sa 22 is merely indicative of a closer or looser connection between the individual lines ( 1971 :28). Cf. also Cross and Freedman who summarize the evidence concerning the usage of impf. in Hebrew poetry: "lt can no longer be doubted, however, that the imperfect form of the verb was the common, generally used verb form in old Israelite

poetry, as in old Canaanite poetry, and that its time aspect was determined by the context, not the presence or absence ofthe conjunction" (1953:20).
99 11no is a minus in 2Sa 22: 12 which Cross and Freedman ascribe to a dittographic mistake made by the psalmist on account ofthe following two words also starting with a o (1953:25).
100 BHS understands m1::i•::io as a possible gloss which can be deleted on metric grounds, since the colon appears somewhat metrically overcrowded.
101 2Sa 22: 12 reads c•o-nit!in from i17t!in 'sieve' (in Neo-Hebrew) instead of c•o-n:iuin which is understood by Cross and Freedman as referring "to the clouds as the sieve-Iike containers from which the rain-water drops" (1953:25). From a text-critical perspective this reading, as a lectio difficilior, should have preference over the MT in Psa 18:12.
102 Cross and Freedman understand i1JJO as a corruption of 1,JJ with the o being a dittography of the final consonant of the preceding word (1953:25), omitting it altogether on account of the metrical system observed in Psa 18 which would draw the final phrase of verse 12 metrically to the beginning of verse 13. Hence, they emendate verse 12 and 13 to the following: i17lJ cpmli ':Jll as a variant of 11::ill Cl:Jll i1,ll creating the
first actual colon (although the text in Psa 18 retains both variants in a conflated manner) and t!iM •'?m1 ,1::i as the second colon (1953:25). We find, however, that i1ll0 is not so easily explained as dittography - one has to assume two irregularities in order to make a reasonable omission - and therefore retain it, especially since it constitutes an important aspect ofthe theophany in itself(cf. Kraus, 196Oa:144).
103 LXX is followed here which reads al vE<!>üm indicating a plural form without personal pronoun suffix.
104 2Sa 22: 13 reads 17ll:J 'kindle, begin to bum', assuming metathesis between 17:Jll '(clouds) went by' and 17ll:J. However, the character of the accompanying natural phenomena of the theophany seem to legitimate the reading of MT in Psa 18 (cf. Barthelemy, Hulst, Lohfink, et al., 1979:187).
105 Schmuttermayr omits ,1::i 'hail' as a dittography of 11::ill, trying to save the metric structure ofthe verse (1971 :75f.). 106 Tue 1-consecutivum is Ieft out in 2Sa 22:14.
107 Here, again, we come across the archaic meaning of ::i (cf. notes to verse 9) denoting 'from'. 2Sa 22:14 has probably been corrected to JO. Note a similar usage in Ugaritic (Schmuttermayr, 1971 :76).
108 t!iM-•'?m1 ,,::i appears tobe dittography of verse 13 (cf. Schmuttermayr, 1971:77; Cross and Freedman, 1953:25). However, not every repetition must be the result of dittography, since it also constitutes an important element of Hebrew verse (cf. the various repetitions ofHebrew verse in the victory song ofDeborah and Barak in Jdg 5).

From our translation of the text it has become obvious that the passage in Psa 18:8-16 presents numerous textual problems, while the question of dating naturally develops out oftext-critical observations. lt is interesting to note that Cross and Freedman create from a Doppeltext some kind of a Mischtext, conflating the two versions under text-critical considerations into one text.116 Schmuttermayr applies a similar method and follows Cross and Freedman to a large degree. This presupposes an underlying common Urtext for both recensions. The proposed date for this text forming the basis of both 2Sa 22 and Psa 18 has varied significantly in scholarly discussion and has been assigned to periods from between the 10th century B.C. and Maccabean times.117 Even though the question of dating a biblical text often
109 Dahood presents an interesting Ugaritic etymology for n'?t!i, namely W:, 'to forge, hammer'. However, the meaning 'to send' fits our context perfectly (cf. Dahood, 1966:109). 110 2Sa 22: 15 omits the personal pronoun suffix. lll Note the inversion ofsubject and predicate and the change oftempora.
112 The reading proposed by Schmuttermayr (1971 :78) and also Cross and Freedman (1953:25f.): oon•, p;::i c•p;::i tries to explain Psa 18:15 on the basis of Psa 144:5 which is, however, methodologically questionable, since Psa 144 follows Psa 18 as shown below. They explain the Ioss of p;::i on account of haplography. MT in Psa 18:15 reads the verb ::i; frorn ::i::i; 'multiply' supported by the LXX which has the same Vorlage as Psa 18 and reads E"ITA170uvEv.
113 The reading ofc• 'sea, ocean' instead ofc•o 'waters' is based on 2Sa 22:16 and several mss (De-Rossi, IV, 11) and is more fitting to the concept of';,::ir, r,11010. The text in Psa 18 could be the result of a misinterpreted archaic mem-encliticum (Joüon, 1991,2:473, §129u; cf. Schrnuttermayr, 1971 :82 who follows Cross and Freedman, 1953:26).
114 In this occurrence the more archaic usage of the preposition ::i instead of ]O is preserved in2Sa22:16.
115 The change from third to second person is not found in 2Sa 22:16, but can be observed in other places (e.g., Psa 13:6), and should thus be retained. n;i,J could also be rendered with 'roar, shout' which is evident from philological comparison with Aramaic illl and Ugaritic g'r. Craigie, however, contends that the Ugaritic evidence is too ambiguous, since it is based on a single text in which the word under discussion appears in a fragmented portion of the respective tablet (1983: 170).
116 Psa 18 and 2Sa 22 are of a peculiar character within the corpus of biblical texts, because they represent a Doppeltext recorded in different bodies of biblical literature. For a list of other Doppeltexte, see Schmuttermayr (1971:15, n. 8). Hossfeld, in his study of the growth-phases of Psa 18, calls it a "formenkritisches Unikum" (1986:173).
117 The following Iist shows the various dates assigned to Psa 18, viz., the text behind it, followed by a representative selection of scholars opting for this date: (1) 10th century

epitomizes a scholarly confession of faith which in turn influences the interpretation of the various adduced evidences, we would nevertheless adhere to the early dating of Psa 18, i.e., the 10th century B.C. There seems to be sufficient evidence118 and even relative consensus119 that would allow for such a proposal.
4.3.2.2. The Language ofPsalm 18:6-18
The following tables seek to provide a basis for a statistical comparison of the vocabulary used in the texts that are of relevance to the present study. While the acquaintance with the terminology of the warrior and God of heaven metaphors in the specific text is endeavoured, it will be interesting to note what kind of semantic word-fields120 can be established for our metaphors. Along the same line, it will be interesting to observe the variance of terminology employed for the same concept, i.e., one of the two metaphors under consideration. The investigation will be limited to the
B.C. - Cross and Freedman (1953); Freedman (1976); (2) end of 7th century B.C. Gunkel (1968); (3) post-exilic period - Deissler (1963); (4) Maccabean period - Duhm (1922). Hossfeld has solved the problem in proposing four diachronic growth-phases for Psa 18: (1) verses 33-50: oldest phase of the psalm; song of praise of an unidentifiable king in pre-exilic times; (2) verses 3-20: the second phase serves as an anthologizing preamble of the psalm, applying the song of praise to every individual in need; it has been introduced shortly before the exile; (3) verses 26-31: in the third phase which has been introduced after the destruction of 586 B.C. the theology of the song of praise is developed for the needs of the exilic community; (4) verses l; 21-25; 51: the fourth phase transforms the spiritual song into a song of David through the nomistic Deuteronomist during the late exilic period (1986: l 86f.). While one has to appreciate Hossfeld's literary analysis, different literary components do not necessitate a diachronic origin for the respective parts of the psalm, and the unity of Psa 18 appears to remain a viable option.
118 A number ofindicators have appeared in the footnotes to the translation of Psa 18:8-16 above. To mention a few: (1) the archaic usage ofthe preposition ::i instead ofJo; (2) the mem-encliticum in Psa 18:16; (3) orthographic archaisms, especially the tendency toward defective spelling in 2Sa 22; (4) indicators of Canaanite influences in vocabulary; (5) similarities to other archaic Hebrew verse (Exo 15; Deu 32; Jdg 5; Psa 68; etc.); (6) particularities in the usage of the divine name. As mentioned above, these criteria do not 'prove' an early date for the text, but they provide a more tangible set of data than literary critical hypothesizing.
119 The phrase 'relative consensus' refers to the fact that most scholars accept an early date oforigin for at least parts of Psa 18.
120 The purpose of semantics is to decipher the meaning that is transmitted via a word in a certain context, i.e., to go beyond mere etymology. As Louw puts it '"the meaning of a word' is not a statement about something a word 'has' as a 'possession', but merely that meaning is conveyed by using [his italics] words as conventional linguistic signs to convey certain features of meaning" (1992:1078). The result of semantic analysis can be described as "translational equivalents". For an introductory article on biblical semantics, see Louw (1992:1077-1081).

As becomes apparent from Table 5, there are three somewhat unexpected
perf. forms in our passage: il'?~ (vs. 9); n~,9 (vs. 9); and n:;i~ (vs. 13).122 Most commentators bypass the sudden change oftempora in vs. 9, or find it difficult to explain. 123 Cross and Freedman mention the change of tempora from perf. to impf. and back to perf. in vs. 9, but fail to give any clue as to why it takes place (1953:24, n. 19). It is noticeable that there is an inversion of predicate and subject in the second colon of vs. 9, although the inversion also takes place in the third colon without an impf. form. A satisfactory explanation of the syntactical and morphological phenomenon and its possible interrelation has not been given as yet. In addition to the change from yiqtol (impf.) to qatal (perf.) forms, there is also an attestation of yiqtol forms that have qatal value with and without a i-consecutivum. Although this is not in harmony with the normal usage of Hebrew tenses, it can be accredited to the particularities of early Hebrew poetry (Cross and Freedman, 1953:19f.). Joüon notes, however, "that these preterital yiqtols are punctiliar in force, not habitual, repetitive, etc." (1991:369, §113h).124 For the table of nouns appearing in the text of Psa 18:8-16 we have omitted the morphological analysis, since it does not have any substantial bearing on the statistical evaluation of the employed vocabulary.

Although we agree with the date assigned to the poem by Freedman, one nevertheless has to be cautious in the usage of his set of criteria, since it is based on a strong evolutionary view of the development of Israelite religion. As he mentions himself, his approach is characterized by a certain degree of circular reasoning, narnely, because of his assumption that there was a development in the usage of divine narnes, he organizes the poems according to this pattern which in turn supports the assumption (1976:86f.). 129 Cf. note 128.

Table 6 shows that the nominal forms employed for the description of the appearance of God as warrior and as the God of heaven are predominantly from the realm of natural phenomena, but at the same time, seem to go beyond the portrayal of a mere natural physical event. This would point to the fact that a process of metaphorization is taking place within the linguistic evidence. On the whole the verbal and nominal forms of Psa 18:8-16 are divergent and strongly descriptive, creating a rieb organic structure of metaphorical expressions. As Kuntz observes correctly: "A minimal repetition of nouns and verbs alike suggests to us that an indirect, if not intentionally allusive, element is operative within the theophanic description" (1983:15). Through this literary variance the poet creates an atmosphere of splendor and brilliance, underlining the character of God descending from heaven as a warr1or.
4.3.2.3. Literary Analysis ofPsalm 18
Although we are dealing with a limited amount of text within Psa 18, it is nevertheless important to establish the structure of the psalm as a whole. A presupposition for such an undertaking is the inquiry into the unity of the psalm, i.e., the question if it is legitimate to apply an overall literary structure to the text. Although the psalm has various structural elements,130 it displays a compositional unity which is substantially supported by the parallel passage in 2Sa 22.1311n our view, the psalni has tobe considered as
13° Cf. note 117 and our evaluation of Hossfeld's growth phases.
131 Since Psa 18 does not fit the form-critical categories sufficiently, a twofold division is often proposed by form-critical exegetes: vss. 1-31 - an individual lament, and vss. 3251 - a royal thanksgiving psalm. Since this study follows a different approach and there is no evidence in the text that would suggest such a division, the necessity of a twofold structure does not seem apparent. Kuntz argues for the unity of Psa 18 on rhetorical
critical grounds and mentions three indicators: (1) vss. 26-27 has been identified by Cross and Freedman as an ancient gnomic quatrain characterized by "sing-song rhythm
[e.g., the repetition of •ll at the beginning of all four colons] and anthropopathic conceptions" (1953 :21 ). The location of this literary element is strategic and it functions as the rhetorical focal point of the psalm; (2) the divine names and epithets have been distributed in an equal manner throughout the psalm; (3) certain key words and concepts

an organic unity, authored by a literary skilled person during the 10th century B.C. The origin of Psa 18 has been traditionally associated with the person of David, and the subscription creates a historical backdrop to the content of the poem. 132 Since an early date for the writing of Psa 18 has been accepted for the present study, there is nothing that would exclude a connection between the Israelite monarch and the poem, this connection possibly being in the form of a court poet who put the king' s words into verse, or it possibly having been David himself who contributed to the original form of the poem. 133 The overall structural divisions of Psa 18 can be depicted symmetrically as shown below in Graph 5:

appear throughout the psalm in such a way that they point to their homogenous and conscious usage by the psalmist (Kuntz, 1983:19-21).
132 We would not like to enter the discussion of psalm superscriptions which can be reviewed in the introduction to any serious commentary (e.g., Kraus, 1960a:xviii-xxx).
133 Vesco proposes a Davidic relecture of Psa 18, i.e., the final form of Psa 18 as it appears in the MT is the product of the re-interpretative endeavors of a late redactor who read the more ancient part of the poem (vss. 3-20) under the directive guidance of the title and the historical events surrounding the parallel passage in 2Sa 22. This process is comparable to a 'haggadic' type ofMidrashic exegesis and assumes that the addition of

lt can be seen that Psa 18 is clearly structured with the address and praise enclosing the psalm in a symmetrical way. At the center of Psa 18 the four colons of vss. 26-27, the gnomic quatrain, can be found, forming the center from a literary point of view. Within this structure, vss. 8-16 form a subunit,134 describing God as the God of heaven and warrior via the theophanic event. 135 The passage vss. 8-16 itself develops a sub-structure within the overall configuration of Psa 18, while especially the spatial sequence of the passage is of interest, indicating the general direction from above to below.
Vs. 8: Earth Foundations are shaken
Vs. 14-15: Descend Thunder and lightning
Vs. 16: Earth Foundations laid bare
Graph 6: Sub-structure ofPsa 18:8-16 with reference to its spatial dimensions
Graph 6 shows the dimensional structure of the passage under discussion. In Vs. 8, c:r-:i,:r •::r9io serves as the point of departure, while the parallel
expression in vs. 16, '?:;;in ni19io, concludes the pericope with the identical concept, thus creating an inclusio. The psalmist leads his audience from the earth upward to heaven, the dwelling place of Yahweh, and then descends
the psalm titles reflects a certain exegetical activity in the process of transmission, attempting a historization ofthe text (1987:52-57).
134 There is broad consensus on the structural independence of vss. 8-16 that has been interpreted as an indicator for the late intrusion of the passage into the psalm. But Hossfeld and Zenger correctly observe: "Allerdings kann man die Theophanieschilderung literarkritisch nicht nach Vers 7 abtrennen, denn die pronominalen Rückverweise bei gleichbleibendem Subjekt binden die Schilderung zurück an 7••.. Somit kann man syntaktisch-stilistisch nur von relativer Selbständigkeit sprechen" (1993: 119).
135 Hunter adds vss. 17-18 to the theophany passage, arguing that "the poet still describes the action of Yahweh in the theophany". As a further indicator he adduces the •::, which can be found in both vs. 8 and 18 (1987:46). However, the focus of attention clearly shifts between vs. 16 and 17. Furthermore, for the present study, the emphasis does not lie on theophany, but on the warrior and God ofheaven metaphors which often coincide with the theophany event.

together with the divine warrior back to earth, as indicated by 77' (vs. 10) as the terminus technicus of the divine descent. "The poet assuredly favors spatial [his italics] imagery in bis attempt to portray Yabweb' s descent" (Kuntz, 1983: 17).136 While Kuntz interprets tbe usage of spatial imagery as a mere rbetorical talent, 137 we would like to suggest tbat it is the terminology of space wbicb constitutes an integral part of the God of beaven and warrior metapbors. 138 From a literary perspective, Psa 18:8-16 forms an integrated unit witbin tbe structure of tbe psalm as a wbole, displaying a substructure wbicb is designed around tbe description of tbe God of beaven and warrior metapbors, accomplisbed by tbe usage of spatial imagery.139 Resulting from tbese compositional intentions, an atmospbere of dynamic motion, rapid action, and vivid imagery is created.

137 "To summarize, among the poet's many rhetorical talents reflected in this magnificent composition is his masterful use of spatial imagery as a most helpful means for emphasizing both the king's hazardous situation and Yahweh's effective intervention in his servant's behalf which enables royal deliverance and military triumph to occur" (Kuntz, 1987:28).
138 In the course of the exegetical part of the study we will try to substantiate this assumption with further data.
139 We limited our considerations on the literary peculiarities of our passage to mainly structural issues which promised to yield the most interesting results. Besides the points mentioned, the text also presents other literary devices such as alliteration (vss. 8; 12; 13), assonance (vss. 8; 12), transpositional rootplay (vs. 11), synthetic parallelism ('smoke - fire - coals' vs. 9), chiasmus (i11i1' •.. c»7'1 // 1n• p•'?ii, vs. 14), etc. Hunter
(1987:45) correctly observes that the author of Psa 18 "is constantly playing with words" which contributes to the effectiveness ofthe metaphorical language employed in this passage. Furthermore, Hunter mentions the usage of another literary device, i.e., the language of mythology, and he identifies the theophanic event as belonging to the category of "soteriological revelation myths" (1987:48). lt appears difficult to follow Hunter in his anthropological excursion, since theological considerations and comparative presumptions seem to influence his interpretations substantially.

72 4. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER
phenomena described now are reminiscent of an earthquake although the terminology employed seems to transcend a mere naturalistic interpretation. Stressing the spatial dimension of the 'below', the psalmist portrays the innermost foundation parts of the earth as being shaken and tossed around violently as in an earthquake, while r;,1$;:i here refers to the 'nether world'
and is parallel to •'".liJ ''Jt;iio. The terminology employed is allusive of creation and the cosmic struggle (Psa 104; 144). Vs. 8 concludes with an explicative statement in an eclipsed form, providing the reason for the occurring phenomena, i.e., Yahweh's anger. Vs. 9: The psalmist now shifts the focus of attention toward the 'above' and the verb il?.ll serves as a marker for this change of dimension. The language is increasingly metaphorical in character. The nominal forms of the verse are typical terminology denoting God's anger which is described as a visible object coming forth from Yahweh's mouth and nose. Although the psalmist is using the metaphor of God' s body in this context, he falls short of being too explicit about his actual appearance.141 Vs. 9 is suggestive of the events surrounding the Sinai revelation (Exo 19: 19-25),142 while there is an atmosphere of imminent action, i.e., Yahweh is preparing for battle (cf. Jdg 5:4-5), furthered by the choice of the verbal form 1i~:::J 'kindle, ignite'
which has an ingressive connotation. The •'70~ are only used here as an accompanying feature ofthe theophany. Vs. 10: Before Yahweh starts his descent, he divides the heavens, i.e., spreads apart the clouds like a curtain (Psa 104:2; 144:5). While descending he remains the Deus absconditus, since under his feet is thick darkness which is portrayed as a layer of thick, dark clouds epitomizing the closeness ofYahweh's presence. Vs. 11: Yahweh now mounts the :in:;,, a supernatural winged creature143 which has been juxta-positioned through a parallelism with on-•;ip 'wings of the wind'. While the parallelism indicates a proximity of these two objects, it does not necessitate that they are equivalents, but rather complementary and instrumental in the description of the swiftness of Yahweh's descent. The portrayal of God mounting and riding on the cherub
141 Kuntz also observes this possibly theologically-inclined hesitancy of the psalmist to describe the divine form: "Yet in this depiction of Yahweh's angry approach, the poet does not presume to expose the divine form itself. While he enumerates several parts of Yahweh's body - his nostrils (v. 9a), mouth (v. 9b), and feet (v. 10b), he stops short of fabricating a concrete image of the deity" (1983:17).
142 lt is interesting to note that the earthquake, smoke, and fire at Sinai are preparatory events preceding the actual descent of Yahweh. In the same manner, these phenomena are emitted from him, i.e., they also lead out in the theophany. 143 We will limit our remarks about the cherub here to this rather general description.

is rare, since usually he is depicted as sitting enthroned on the cherubim throne (Psa 80:2; 99: 1). Only in Ezekiel do we find a similar situation (Eze
10:18,19 and 11:22), although there the plural form •':;m:;, is used. The imagery of this vs. is clearly geared toward the warrior metaphor depicting Yahweh as riding on the cloud chariot, epitomized by the cherub (Longman III, 1982:294f.). Vs. 12: The theme of Yahweh's dark cover is once more taken up, enhancing the intensity of the imagery. Dark storm-clouds heavy with water are no longer only under his feet, but surround Yahweh in the form of a pavilion as he descends from heaven, and shrouding him in secrecy. Vs. 13: There is a sharp contrast in imagery to the preceding vs. While vs. 12 creates an atmosphere of threatening darkness, vs. 13 opens with the brightness before Yahweh. 144 The threatening thunderstorm now comes · alive, and from the resulting lightning sudden brightness is to be expected. Also 'hail' and 'coals of fire' accompany the natural phenomenon.145 ~,:;i.p continues the atmosphere of the passage's dynamic motion in this verse. Vs. 14: The thunder of the storm becomes the voice of Yahweh, viz., Elyon, while 'voice' in connection with God is often used as meaning 'thunder' (Job 37:4-5; Psa 29:3), and again we can observe the blending of naturalistic depiction and metaphorical application. Vs. 14c is identical to vs. 13b, and secures the continuation of the thunderstorm motif, especially the emission of lightning in the following vs. Vs. 15: Yahweh sends out bis arrows and scatters them all over the dark sky, creating the image of lightning flashing back and forth, as becomes evident through the parallelism created in the second colon.146 Beyond the natural phenomenon described here, the ambivalence of the vs. also allows for the interpretation of the arrows as being directed against the king's enemies. Yahweh's lightning is not merely a natural occurrence, but also a strong indication for the presence ofthe warrior imagery.
144 Some commentators have understood vs. 13 as a "mixture of contradictions" (e.g., Hunter, 1987:50), since it creates distinct contrasts ('brightness' - 'darkness' in vs. 12; 'hail' - 'coals'), but it is certainly coherent when seen in the context ofthe description of a thunderstorm.
145 Tue description seems tobe phenomenologically oriented, and other than in vs. 9, 'coals offire' in this context may refer to the lightning emitted by the storm clouds.
146 The ambivalence of the pronominal suffixes of the verbal forms is noted. Normally the subject ofthe suffixes is taken from vs. 3, i.e., the king's enemies. However, it would be a somewhat far-removed cross reference. Keel comments: "Der Psalmist läßt Jahwe die Pfeile nach dem Abschuß noch verwirren, um dem Zickzackweg des Blitzes gerecht zu werden" (1972:196).

Vs. 16: Yahweh's descent is accomplished and the spatial cycle is completed. As in vs. 8, the focus of attention again shifts to the results of Yahweh's anger on the innermost foundation of the earth, while the intensity of the divine impact seems to have increased. While the 'foundations' were only shaken in vs. 8, they are now 'exposed'. The author of Psa 18:8-16 has created a vivid description of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors by means of a portrayal of natural phenomena. Interestingly, especially the naturalistic descriptions of Job 36 and 37 provide an accurate backdrop and a close inner-biblical parallel to the imagery used in our passage. As mentioned before, the choice of language in the text seems to transcend the mere depiction of natural occurrences, pointing to the reality of Yahweh's descent from heaven to battle against the king's enemies.
4.3.3. Psalm 21:9-13
Psa 21 belongs to the group of psalms which have been categorized as representing the warrior metaphor. 147 Within the Hebrew psalter this psalm is part of a group of royal psalms,148 and a proximity in form and content to Psa 20 can be observed which goes beyond matters of mere sequence (Kuntz, 1987:157).149 Psa 21 has to some degree experienced scholarly neglect, and only during the past 25 years has it been the subject of focused
attention, especially from a literary perspective.15° For the purpose of the present study we will concentrate on the passage in vss. 9-13.
147 Although the God of heaven and warrior metaphors are understood as being closely connected to each other, we have also chosen psalms which appear to emphasize only one of the two metaphors.
148 Our usage ofthe term 'royal psalms' may not coincide with the form-critical category of the same name created by Gunkel, but rather must be understood along pragmatic lines, i.e., referring to these psalms in which the person of the king is mentioned explicitly: Psa 18:51; 20:10; 21:2; 21:8; 45:2; 45:12; 45:15; 45:16; 61:7; 63:12; 72:1; 89:28; 144:10.
149 Zenger aptly summarizes the various points of contact between Psa 20 and Psa 21, but at the same time rejects a common predecessor for both psalms on account oftheir literary distinctiveness (Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993: l 39f.).
150 Besides the current commentaries, the main studies and notes on Psa 21 are: Driver (1957-58:129); Fensham (1965:193-202); Morrow (1968:558-559); Quintens (1978:516-541); Auffret (1980:91-93); Kuntz (1987:157-176); Loretz (1988a:77-106); and Auffret (1990:385-410). Loretz provides a short overview on the state of research for Psa 21 (1988a:77-81).

151 Dahood translates 'left hand' forming the word-pair 71• • ll'0' (1966:163, n. 10). However, ,, seems to need a qualifier in order to indicate the left hand (cf. Jdg 3:21 ).
152 Quintens translates ~~on 'Que ta main attrape tous tes ennemis' and the following corresponding verbs as jussive forms which is based on his structural consideration that vss. 9-13 form an imaginative malediction (1978:535). This is in line with most modern interpreters who either use the future tense or the jussive for a translation of the passage. However, in our translation we follow the above observed principle that the impf. can denote a narrative past in ancient Hebrew verse, especially if it is located at the beginning of a colon. This tendency is also observable in vss. 4-7 of our psalm where
the verbforms are usually translated with a narrative past. Michel summarizes: "Am Satzanfang stehende impfa. können vergangene Handlungen bezeichnen. Stehen solche impfa. innerhalb von Erzählungsreihen, die durch impfa. csa. wiedergegeben werden, läßt sich zwar kein Unterschied hinsichtlich Zeitstufe oder Aktionsart nachweisen, der den Gebrauch des bloßen impf. erklären könnte; wohl aber scheint der Handlungsablauf unterbrochen zu sein: das bloße impf. gibt kein unmittelbar folgendes Glied an, sondern steht bei einem gedanklichen Neueinsatz oder greift über das vorangehende impf. es. zurück" (1960:137).
153 Two Hebrew mss., the LXX, and Targumim insert ',:,',- which appears to be aimed at smoothing out the text. We prefer MT as the lectio difficilior.
154 Driver provides an interesting parallel from an Old-Babylonian letter indicating the punitive practice of casting the offender into a fiery furnace which might correspond to the situation described in our psalm (cf. Dan 3). He mentions that some mss. even read ,,in:::i although he unfortunately fails to furnish the necessary reference for this statement (1957-58: 129).
155 Dahood translates 7'l:l m,', with 'at the time ofyour fury' (1966:133; cf. also Quintens, 1978:533). While it would suit the parallel expression in the next colon (1!l~:::i), there is scarce evidence for such a meaning of öll!l, perhaps Psa 34:17 or 80:17. Morrow proposes haplography and reads no11'? instead of n11'?, and replaces the preposition :i with :::i which would result in the rendering of the verse with "You will place them in [his italics] a fiery oven opposite your face". In Eze 3:8 a similar expression is used. As tempting as this emendation may be, Morrow does not give any further explanation as to how this scribal error came about and fails to convince (1968:558-559). We follow MT
which is also reflected in the LXX reading Els Kmpov Tou irpoawirou. However, this constellation does not occur elsewhere in the OT which makes a final decision difficult. Our translation serves to reflect the theophanic element of Yahweh's description as a warrior which has already been encountered in Psa 18, although Psa 21 has not been included with the theophanic passages identified by Jeremias (1965:3-5). 156 We understand ;n;i• as a vocative belonging to the second colon ofthe verse.

157 BHS understands the third colon of vs. 10 as a gloss. We have retained MT, since the content of vs. 10c is an integral part of the passage, and the change from 2nd to 3rd person in this colon does not provide sufficient reason to eliminate the line from the text. Würthwein comments on the relationship between gloss and text: "Bei der Arbeit am Text, in die uns die beabsichtigten Änderungen einblicken lassen, handelt es sich um einen vielfach amtlichen [his italics] Prozeß, der in frühe Zeit zurückreicht" (1973:108f.).
158 7::Jlli in combination with JO has a more intense connotation than 'cause to perish' or similar, more passive renderings which are suggested by most translators (Koehler and Baumgartner, 1985:3).
159 Note the perf. forms in the subordinated clause, and the impf. in the main clause (cf. Michel, 1960:192, §30, 32).
160 MT has only the singular form, the plural noro being substantiated by a few Hebrew mss., the LXX (codex Alexandrinus and the Lucian recension), Symmachus, the Targumim, and the Vulgate.
161 This figurative expression refers to Yahweh subduing the king's enemies. There is a logical tension between 13a and 13b. How can Yahweh aim at the enemies' faces when they have turned their backs, or at least, their shoulders? Quintens attempts to explain the situation as Yahweh handing over to the king his enemies who are bound to each other with a rope: "Est-il possible de rapprocher le v. des fameuses scenes de captivite du temple de Kamak, ou la divinite se poste devant les prisonniers alignes epaule contre epaule et lies entre eux par des cordes, pour Ies remettre entre !es mains pharaon?" (1978:533f., n. 56). Although this interpretation has its merits, there may be another possibility which would be more in tune with the traditional rendering of 7'7n'O, with 'bowstring' as a pars pro toto for bow. As has been observed in the exegesis of Psa 18, a clustering of metaphors is also noticeable in Psa 21 :9-13, whereas the sequential logic of the text is not the main focus of attention. The usage of tempora would contribute to such an understanding of two different imageries created alongside each other which may not have a rigid cause-effect relation to each other. However, as will be shown below in the iconographic comparison (chapter 6), it is possible that the enemy is in fleeing position away from the pursuer who makes him turn his shoulder, thus exposing his face toward him.
162 Although 7n'o is not attested elsewhere in that meaning, the phrase tlil'l!:i-'?11 p1:,n seems to facilitate such a rendering.

Tab/e 7: Verba/forms inPsa 21:9-13
Among the verbal forms of Psa 21 :9-13 there are three verbs which occur in an intensified verbal aspect, i.e., either Piel or Polel: .th:i. (vs.
10); 1::J~ (vs. 11); and p:, (vs. 13).165 These verbal modes create an atmosphere which is supportive of the warrior metaphor expressed in the passage. The impfs. have consistently been translated with a narrative past tense because, as in Psa 18, an archaic usage ofyiqtol forms in this passage could be observed (cf. note 152). While it is generally acknowledged that the use of impf. often denotes the past narrative (Niccacci, 1990:194), the criteria for choosing the respective verb form in Hebrew verse are far from clear, and do not seem to lie in the realm of verbal action.166
165 Pie! has traditionally been described as an intensifying mode of the verb. There are, however, inquiries into the exact character of this intensification (cf. Joüon, 1991: 154156). Tue Piel forms observed here clearly have factitive meaning, i.e., "das Subjekt bewirkt am Objekt den von dem entsprechenden Adjektiv oder vom passiven Partizip des Grundstamms ausgesagten Zustand" (Jenni, 1981:155).
166 Niccacci (1991:195-197) observes the following phenomenon: (1) "... YIQTOL can be used as a form for past narrative"; (2) the "use ofthe forms YIQTOL and QATAL for the same tense in parallel lines". Opting for a different approach to verbal tenses in

From the analysis of the verbal and nominal forms it becomes apparent that Psa 21:9-13 employs a language that is distinctly reminiscent of warfare and thus portrays Yahweh as warrior.
4.3.3.3. Literary Analysis ofPsalm 21
Preeminent in the literary discussion of Psa 21 is the question to whom vss. 9-13 are addressed. Kraus understands the passage as directed to the king, but has to eliminate i11i1' from vs. 10, in order to establish a coherent interpretation (1960a:168).172 However, from a literary perspective, Yahweh appears to be the subject not just of this particular passage, but of the whole psalm as weil,173 especially with regard to the literary structure, as will be shown below in Graph 7.

Vss. 2 and 14 create a partial inclusio, effectively framing the poem by referring to Yahweh and bis strength through the repetition of the phrase -;m~,:;i i1Ji1; (Watson, 1984:284) and the word-pair nciD in vs. 2 and i•t!i in vs. 14 (Avishur, 1984:204). In vss. 3-7 the psalmist recounts the blessings bestowed on the king by Yahweh.174 Vs. 8 serves as the axis of Psa 21, shifting the focus of attention from the king to Yahweh.175 God as warrior is

Graph 8: Focusing ofimagery in Psa 21:9-13
The passage in vss. 9-13 forms a distinct unit within Psa 21, marked by a clustering of images which communicate the effectiveness of God' s protection for the king through his warfare against the king's enemies. The five verses describe the various ways in which the enemies who form the compositional object of each verse have been attacked and finally destroyed. Graph 8 shows the concentric focusing ofthe imagery. Vss. 9-13 communicate the warrior metaphor in a rather concentrated way and clearly show that Yahweh is the recipient of the psalmist's words. On the question ofthe date of composition for Psa 21, various features point to an early date, e.g., the archaic usage of language (Fensham, 1965:200f.),
176 Quintens proposes a similar structural division, although he understands the psalm as a liturgy of an enthronement event or as a commemoration of such (1978:540). This judgement is influenced by his broad comparative approach in which he contrasts Psa 21 with the royal hymn of Thutmosis III and similar texts from Egyptian (15th to 12th centuries B.C.), Canaanite and Aramaic inscriptions (9th to 1st centuries B.C.), and material from Ugarit. His obvious endeavor is to marry the historical-comparative approach with a literary interpretation (1978:520). Thus his literary structure of Psa 21 reflects his somewhat chronologically and geographically divergent comparative attempts: Vs. 2: introduction (indicative); vss. 3-7: five benedictions (indicative); vs. 8: transition (conditional); vss. 9-13: five maledictions (jussive); and vs. 14: conclusion (jussive) (1978:534f.). Fensham also categorizes Psa 21 as an enthronement psalm, but studies it in the light of Hittite vassal-treaties, coming to the conclusion that the idea of covenant forms the central theme of Psa 21, hinging on vs. 8 (1965:200). However, while the results ofhis comparative approach may be valuable, Fensham's consideration seems to be influenced by a theologically motivated tendency that tries to identify the covenant as the major theme of Israelite history. Auffret approaches Psa 21 from a more literary perspective and proposes a structure that is similar, but more detailed, and considers also the literary relationship between Psa 20 and 21. He concentrates especially on word-pairs and recurring "mots stereotypee", establishing a concentric symmetry (vss. 2//14; 3//13; 4//12; etc.), a parallel symmetry (vss. 2//8; 3//9; 4//10; etc.), and a chiasm hinging on vs. 8 (1990:402-407).

the affinities to extra-biblical literature177 (Quintens, 1978:520-534; Fensham, 1965:196-202), the use of impf. for expressing a narrative past, the imagery employed, etc. We would therefore propose a date between the 10th and 8th century B.C. 178
4.3.3.4. Comment on Psalm 21:9-13
While vss. 3-7 have described Yahweh's blessings bestowed on the king, vss. 9-13 portray Yahweh's warfare, bestowed on the king's enemies. Vs. 8 serves as a transitional point connecting the two units, thus providing the rationale for both. Vs. 9: Tue first attack on the enemies is achieved via the imagery of Yahweh finding out the enemies which goes beyond merely locating them, and has to be understood in a more physical way, i.e., seizing the enemy,
communicated by an expression allusive of warfare ~r:;;i;~-',:;>';, '9';1; ~~1?1:1 and the parallel in the second colon ofvs. 9.179 Vs. 10: This verse differentiates itselfthrough its tri-colon design which we understand as belonging to the original composition (cf. Psa 18:14). Yahweh, addressed in the vocative at the end of the second colon, puts the enemies as into a fiery fumace, a capital punishment known throughout the ANE (Driver, 1957-58:129; Loretz, 1988a:85). '9'~ n.p';, 'at the time ofyour appearance' constitutes a theophanic element and is allusive to Psa 18:8-16. Yahweh's arrival is equivalent to the destruction of the enemies.180 The
consumption ofthe enemies by Yahweh's anger (•.p7:;1; ie~:;i), which forms a
chiasm with the parallel expression rli~ •7:;,~n, indicates their complete destruction through fire. The same imagery has been employed in Psa 18:9. Vs. 11: Tue complete annihilation of God's enemies by extinguishing their offspring from the earth is reminiscent of the instruction given for Israelite warfare during the Conquest period (Jos 6: 17), and also in the Monarchy (lSa 15:3). A connection is made to the religious dimension ofwarfare. 181 Vs. 12: The focus of attention momentarily shifts to the enemies who are said to have plotted evil devices against Yahweh, though without
177 This point has to be evaluated with considerable caution; cf. note 176.

181 Kang investigates the Hebrew •in 'ban' as a term for utter destruction in Israelite warfare and connects it to the concept ofholiness (1989:80-84).

succeeding. lt appears that the psalmist here provides a reason for the legitimate destruction of the enemies. Vs. 13: Two final imageries which are placed alongside each other, without necessarily providing logical coherence, conclude the description of God as warrior: (1) the subduing of the king' s enemies through making them turn
their shoulder (•;;itp iOIJ'tql;l), thus exposing them without defense; and (2) aiming with the bowstring which functions as a pars pro toto for the weapon182 against their faces. The passage in Psa 21 :9-13 develops the warrior metaphor in a systematic fashion by assembling the various means of warfare which are at the disposal of Yahweh. The historical dimension of the pericope may reflect the allusion to a battle experienced by the Israelite king in which he experienced Yahweh's protection from bis enemies (Dahood, 1966:131; Kuntz, 1987:163).
4.3.4. Psalm 29:3-9
Since the discovery of Ugaritic literature and its comparison with the biblical text, Psa 29 has been linked to a Canaanite background,183 and, from this perspective, it has served as a paradigm for the examination of Hebrew-Canaanite literary interdependence and thus been the subject of numerous studies.184 According to our classification, Psa 29 belongs to the
182 Cf. Rüterswörden's informative article about Yahweh's rainbow in Gen 9:13 and ancient archery in general. He observes that out of war the reflex bow was not stringed, and that the attaching of the string was the first activity in using the bow for warfare (1988:257). The allusion to the bowstring in our verse might refer to this preparatory activity which precedes the actual shooting.
183 The exact nature of that relationship has been the subject of wide discussion (see note 184 and the references given there), but Hossfeld now claims a certain consensus which goes back to Loretz's proposition of a twofold Canaanite tradition behind Psa 29: "Mehr und mehr setzt sich die Meinung durch, daß er [Psa 29] sowohl an Überlieferungen zum Götterkönig EI wie zum dynamischen Wettergott Baal anknüpft, sie auf seine Weise vermischt und auf JHWH überträgt" (Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993:180; Loretz, 1984:150152).
184 Loretz provides a good summary ofthe main developments in the history ofresearch for this particular psalm (1984:11-22). Fora bibliography of studies dealing with Psa 29 up to 1988, see Loretz (1988b:232-248). Fora more recent treatment ofthe discussion, see Greenstein (1992:49, n. 1). The danger in approaching such a widely debated psalm is that of the reiteration of various viewpoints which normally leads to a mere reshuffling of the evidence. Hence, we will concentrate on the immediate exegesis of the psalter without devoting too much space to the question of Canaanite origin of this psalm.

category of psalms representing primarily the God of heaven metaphor.185 For the objective ofthe present study we will limit our discussion to vss. 39 which form the central body ofthe psalm. 186

185 Although Psa 29 is here placed among the psalms representing the God of heaven metaphor, the affinity to the warrior metaphor has been noted by various scholars, e.g., Craigie (1972:148; 1983:245), Grad! (1979:109f.), Greenstein (1992:54), et al. ·
186 There are various important expressions found in vss. 1-2 and 10-11 which have a significant bearing on the overall interpretation of the psalm, e.g., ci•',111 'J::l (vs. 1), w,p·n,,ii:::i (vs. 2), and :::it!i• '?1:::10', ii1ii' (vs. 10), and which will be evaluated in the structural analysis ofthe psalm below. We have nevertheless focused on vss. 3-9, since they constitute the section in which the communication of the God of heaven metaphor forms the central motif.
187 We follow the interpretation of ii1ii' '?1p as a construct chain meaning 'the voice of Yahweh' (Mittmann, 1978:176f.). Tue understanding of '?1p as an interjection 'Hark!' has been proposed by various commentators (e.g., Vogt, 1960:17f., n. 1) and is morphologically and syntactically possible, but seems to ignore the importance of Yahweh's '?1p which appears as a terminus technicus in theophanic passages (Deu 5:25; Psa 18:14; 104:7; Joe 4:16). To limit the meaning of'?1p to 'thunder' (Loretz, 1984:34) creates a logical tension in the interpretation of vss. 5 and 7, and rather has to be understood along the lines of war poetry possibly alluding to a battle cry (Craigie, 1983:246), although the voice ofGod often is associated with the sound ofthunder (Job 37:4,5; 40:9; Psa 29:3; 68:33) and fits the imagery ofan approaching thunderstorm. Tue
rendering ofthe LXX (<j>wv11 Kvp(ov) supports this explanation. Furthermore, the parallel second colons in vss. 3, 5, and 8 have ii1ii' as the subject which would lead to the conclusion that the ii1ii' '?1p is parallel to ii1ii' and functions as a divine epithet denoting bis appearance which is accompanied by a thunderstorm: "Jahwes Stimme ist alldem zufolge ein Organ seines kosmischen Waltens und ist als solches eine sich im Tosen des Gewitters nur besonders machtvoll artikulierende Erscheinungsform Jahwes" (Mittmann, 1978:177; cf. Jeremias, 1965:20).
188 MT appears to be corrupt here, since the second colon does not fit into the metric structure of the verse. Loretz has aptly summarized the various solutions brought forth (1984:32-34) which either describe the colon as a gloss or a misplaced line (BHS suggests from vs. 7). Any literary consideration based on the structure of vs. 3 has to bear this problem in mind. Whatever the exact position of this colon may be, contentwise it is certainly in tune with the theme ofthe passage and will thus be retained. With regard to the divine epithet 11::0ii-'?III, Margulis, in connection with vs. 2, suggests a parallelism of tlt!i and 71::0 while the latter one denotes "the concrete and epiphanous Yahweh (as warrior)..." (1970:336f.). Tue perf. form ofthe verb tlJl1 has been translated as a present tense, since it denotes a synchronic action. Michel comments on the choice ofperf. for such an action: "Das Kriterium für die Wahl des perf. scheint darin zu liegen, daß eine selbstgewichtige Tatsache berichtet wird, die in keinem Abhängigkeitsverhältnis steht" (1960:89).

189 Mythological explanations for tl':J7 tl'O abound (cf. Loretz, 1984:35; Mittmann, 1978:191), but the chosen imagery is the description of a natural phenomenon, i.e., a thunderstorm forming over the Mediterranean sea (Loretz, 1984:36). Thus tl':J7 tl'O should first be understood as referring to the Mediterranean, though a certain polyvalence can be observed.
190 The nomina n:, and 77n are attributive to ,,p and the verse could be translated: 'the voice ofYahweh is powerful, the voice ofYahweh is majestic'.
191 Some commentators have vocalized 1::ir!i in 5b as a Piel, but the usage of the same verbal root in Qal and Piel has to be understood along the lines of an intensifying parallelism.
192 Although this verse does not use the introductory phrase n,n, ,,p, there is little doubt that it belonged to the original version of the poem, since it describes a motif which clearly belongs to the theophanic event (Exo 19:18) and to the appearance ofGod as warrior as demonstrated in the exodus experience (Psa 114:4,6). Mittmann (1978:18lf.) deletes vs. 6 as a later addition motivated by vs. 8.
193 The final o oftli•p1•1 is understood as a mem-encliticum known from Ugaritic (Dahood, 1966:178) and not as a personal suffix as MT indicates. Against this notion, see Loretz (1984:40f.), who understands the Cl as a later addition which attached vs. 6 to vs. 5.
194 lt is not altogether clear as to which animal tlM7 refers, but the parallel ',w and a possible Akkadian etymology rimu point to the fact that we are dealing with bos primigenius, i.e., the 'wild ox' or 'aurochs' (Committee on Translations, 1972:63).
195 The meaning of ::i~n in connection with the 'flames of fire', i.e., lightning is uncertain, since it normally denotes the terminus technicus for the activities of hewing of stone, metal, or wood. Greenstein (1992:50-53) has summarized the various solutions: (1) reconstruction of the vs. through the introduction of an appropriate object for ::i~n on account of haplography; (2) creating a bicolon by proposing homoioteleuton; (3) suggesting a figurative usage for ::i~n; (4) finding a new meaning for the verb through comparative philology, e.g., 'ignite', 'strike', or 'fashion'. Greenstein himselfemendates MT and reads ,•~n instead of::i~n and thus renders vs. 7: "Hark! YHWH - his arrows are flames offire" (1992:56). As evidence he adduces ANE iconography where arrows and arrow-like weapons are used to indicate lightning (cf. below in chapter 5). Although his observations are correct with regard to the content of vs. 7 and the imagery is that of Yahweh distributing lightning like arrows, the emendation is not easily explicable on text-critical grounds, since the transition from ::i to ,, viz., ,, is unlikely in early Hebrew. Tue most likely solution which would take MT into consideration is the figurative use of ::i~n denoting the effect God's voice has on the mountains, i.e., such an impact that it creates sparks like a firestone, viz., flames of fire (Strauß, 1970:95; Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993:184). However, a final decision in this case is difficult to make.
196 Various commentators insert vs. 3b at the end of vs. 7 creating a bicolon. However, a monocolon in such a position can also be observed in other passages (e.g., Exo 15:18; Psa 92:9). Mittmann observes: "Vor allem an V. 7 entzündet sich die konjekturale

198 7::iio denotes the semi-desert, a steppe, a "land without permanent settlements" (Dahood, 1966:178).
199 Tue understanding of ',•n• as a Hiphil and not a Qal is indicated by the context, i.e., Yahweh being the subject ofboth colons.
200 The identification of !!iip 7::iio is not clear. If understood in a geographical sense, various identifications are offered: (1) Kadesh on the Orontes (Dahood, 1966: 178); (2) the Syrian desert (Ginsberg, 1969:45, n. 2); and (3) the Negev, viz., Sinai region (Strauß, 197O:95f.; Margulis, 197O:34lf.). In opposition to the geographical identification, the expression would refer to 'the holy desert', denoting the uninhabited and barren space beyond human control (Craigie, 1983:248). This would be in tune with a more mythological interpretation of Psa 29 (Seybold, 1980:211). We will retum to the geographical dimensions of Psa 29 below. 201 BHS suggests with LXX and Peshitta to read '?•n•1 instead of'?•n•.
202 With some hesitancy we follow MT (see note 204). However, BHS suggests a vocalization of n,',•11 as n,',•11 from :,',11 'mighty tree, oak'. This would establish the parallelism with the following colon, which repeatedly has been observed throughout the psalm. Dahood maintains the vocalization of MT on account of a similar passage in Job 39:1 (1966:178f.).
203 Observes Mittmann: "Das [i.e., the difficult text of vs. 9] gilt zumindest für das Wort y/iwll, dem man in Analogie zu y/iyl V. 8 die kausative Bedeutung 'kreißen lassen' oder 'beben machen' unterschiebt. Demgegenüber ist jedoch mit Nachdruck festzustellen, daß die Intensivstämme dieses Verbs sonst stets 'hervorbringen' (po'lel) bzw. 'hervorgebracht werden' (po'lal) bedeuten, und zwar im Sinne der Geburt oder der Erzeugung, wobei letzteres auch von Gott ausgesagt werden kann" (1978:185).
204 The fern. plur. of the verb is unusual, thus the BHS suggests a reading of the more common plural t:l'7ll' instead ofni7»'. As Mittmann (1978:185-187) correctly observes, it appears that one has to make a choice in vs. 9a and b as to what is intended: a description of the fauna or flora. In its present form, the first nomen refers to animals, while the second nomen indicates a botanical term. One either has to vocalize the first term differently or emendate the second, in order to create parallel terms. A different vocalization is more easily accomplished from a text-critical ·perspective, unless the psalmist wanted to describe the effect ofthe divine thunderstorm on both fauna and flora which would correspond to the meaning ofthe two verbs involved. Margulis presents an altogether different reading of vs. 9: "Tue voice of Yahweh riles (the Gulf of) Eloth, lt unleashes the storms of Teman" (1970:335). This translation is based on a number of

lt has become evident that the text of Psa 29:3-9 is in such a state that the translation has to remain provisional, while we have to assume a difficult history of transmission. Especially vss. 3, 7, and 9 create a number of problems which have not been solved in a satisfactory way. While textual emendations, deletions, and relocations abound in the relevant literature, in most cases they have not produced fruitful results.207 This state of affairs has tobe kept in mind with regard to the literary analysis of Psa 29.

emendations (Margulis, 1970:338-342), but is attractive through its geographic allusions. However, it rests on such a variety of textual changes that it approaches dangerously text-critical conjecture.
205 1',:, could be dittography and would fall away, but there is no textual evidence for such an emendation.
206 Vs. 9c seems strangely detached, since ·it does not correspond to the content of the preceding vss. in any obvious way. Mittmann assumes a missing preceding stichos for which he adduces vs. 3b (1978:188f.), while Loretz connects the line to vs. 2b (1984:31).
207 As an example we may take Mittmann's informative article where he sets out to isolate the original form of the poem: "Hinter der heutigen Gestalt muß sich eine Grundform verbergen, und die gegenwärtige Unform kann nur das Ergebnis sekundärer Störungen sein" (1978:173). Thus he eliminates vss. 6 and 7 as later theologically motivated additions, and moves vs. 3b in front of vs. 9. In this way he creates a streamlined Hebrew poem which he describes as a "Musterbeispiel seiner Gattung" (1978:192). However, he is not willing to ignore the eliminated texts altogether, since they seem to incorporate important material relevant for the overall interpretation of the psalm (1978:178-182). This text- and literary-critical ambiguity expresses a certain inconsistency in the approach, a tendency Mittmann himself strongly criticizes (1978:173). In short, Mittmann's approach, which is representative for numerous others, appears to ignore the poetic diversity ofHebrew verse. We would agree with Macholz's criticism: "Mein Widerspruch gegen M. [Mittmann] ist grundsätzlich; er betriffi M.s Prämissen und seinen Ansatz, der die Ergebnisse vorbestimmt: Seine ästhetischen Kategorien scheinen mir der 'hebräischen Poesie' nicht angemessen zu sein ('klassisches Ebenmaß' - ich würde es übrigens eher 'klassizistisch' nennen). Und die 'Gattungen', besonders die der Psalmen, halte ich für (sinnvolle) Abstraktionen, für idealtypische Konstrukte. 'Musterbeispiele' kann man, muß man sich selber herstellen aber das sind keine 'Ursprungsformen'!" (1980:324, n. 1).

lt appears that one cannot limit the expression to the sound ofthunder, but can denote the sound ofhis presence (Gen 3:8), an equivalent to bis comrnandments (Exo 1S:26), as accompanying phenomenon ofhis appearance at Sinai (Deu 5:25; 18:16), and as ameans ofwarfare (Isa 30:31; 66:6).

214 Observes Rose: "Actually, 'EI' is not a divine name but a common Semitic appellative for the 'divinity'.... In order to make appeals to the divinity, this 'EI' requires some concrete expression either by being related to a locality (e.g., 'EI-Bethel' Gen 35:7), or by adding an epithet (e.g., 'EI ofthe covenant' [El-Berit], Judg 9:46; EI-Roi, Gen 16:13; cf. 22:14)" (1992:1004). This leads Scott to the conclusion that "from the beginning of the use of this term ['?~] in Scripture, it was intended to distinguish the true EI (God) from all false uses ofthat name found in other semitic cultures" (1980:42). In our text '?~ is qualified by 11:::1::i;,.
215 Interestingly, a reversed form of our expression (',~-,1:::i::i) is found in Psa 19:2 in the context of creation, but otherwise there is no other occurrence of 11:::1::i;,-',~ in the OT. With regard to the usage of 11:::1::i in our context, we would agree with Kloos: "The term kbwd could not be shown to have any connection with the storm-god Gust as it has no special ties with EI). The 'glorious god' is god who has tobe, and is honoured; cp. vss. 1-2" (1986:60f.).
216 Nah 1:3 creates an interesting link to the imagery of storm: "The Lord is slow to anger and of great might, and the Lord will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust ofhis feet" (RSV).

The language of Psa 29:3-9 abounds in naturalistic descriptions, portraying the effects of Yahweh' s voice on the various geographic locations and objects, as well as on the plant and animal life.
4.3.4.3. Literary Analysis ofPsalm 29
Since Ginsberg's hypothesis of a Phoenician origin for Psa 29 in 1935 (1936:180), the interpretation of the proposed Canaanite elements found in this psalm can be organized under the following categories:219 (1) Following Ginsberg's line of argument in proposing a northern Phoenician origin for the psalm based on the findings of Ugarit and the literary similarities between the Ugaritic texts and Psa 29, the psalm represents an lsraelite adaptation of a Canaanite hymnus to Ba' al indicating foreign elements in the religion oflsrael.220 (2) Suggesting an Israelite origin for the psalm, while a Canaanite background is accepted.221
219 One has to immediately qualify this somewhat outdated hypothesis with regard to the fact that the material from Ugarit cannot be equated with Canaanite or Phoenician sources, but constitutes a body of evidence in itself.
220 There certainly is a spectrum of opinions within this category: Seybold sees Psa 29 as a Canaanite poem in which the psalmist merely substituted Yahweh for Ba'al (1980:212); Greenstein follows Ginsberg's original proposal (1992:49, n. l); Day tries to establish
the relationship between Ba'al's seven thunders and lightnings with Psa 29 (lt is hard to follow his identification ofBa'al's lightnings with the biblical seraphim) although there are no formal parallels present (1979:149; cf. also Loretz's critique ofDay, 1988b:195198); Strauß maintains that "nicht nur auf Grund der überall durchschlagenden Einzelbezüge, sondern auch im Gesamten der Vorstellungswelt innerhalb des alten Orients Ps 29 als unmittelbar in v. 3-10 auf einen kanaanäischen Baalhymnus zurückgehend erwiesen [ist], während v. lf. entsprechende Vorbilder in der Vorstellung vom Gottkönig EI inmitten seines himmlischen Thronrates aufweist" (1970:98), while this development took place in Israel; cf. also Dahood who emphasizes that "virtually every word in the psalm can now be duplicated in older Canaanite texts" (1966: 175).
221 This is the most widely held opinion incorporating also a variance of views: Craigie accepts a Canaanite background but questions a Canaanite/Phoenician origin (1983:245), while he tries to establish a continuity between Exo 15 and Psa 29, claiming that the psalm "is a Hebrew [his italics] victory hymn, which is probably tobe dated in the early part ofthe United Monarchy" (1972:144); Fensham indicates that Psa 29 "was intended as a missionary poem to make proselites of Canaanites or as an evangelising psalm to convert an apostate Israelite" (1963:96); Gradl endeavors to demonstrate an anti-Canaanite polemic in the employment of Canaanite motifs (1979:109); Macholz suggests that "der Jerusalemer Psalm 29 übernimmt vielleicht einen ganzen jebusitischen Hymnus, jedenfalls aber einen ganzen Traditionskomplex - nicht nur Einzelmotive! -, prägt ihn um und legt ihn als Jahwe-Lob in den Mund Israels" (1980:332); Loretz assumes a long and complicated redaction history and postulates a combination of Ba'al- and El-traditions which took place in post-exilic times with the addition of a "spezifisch israelitisch-jüdische Element ..., das Ps 29 von jeder kanaanäischen Tradition abhebt und zu einem unverwechselbaren Dokument des nachexilischen Jahwismus stempelt" (1984:152; cf. Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993:180);



94 4. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER
(3) A number of scholars prefer an Israelite origin, while they question the Canaanite background of the psalm altogether, proposing a non-Canaanite background.222 One realizes that in answering the question of literary dependency, arguments are heavily influenced by the scholar's respective view of the development of Israelite religion. While an evolutionistic approach finds evidence in favour of various foreign syncretistic traditions and late dates, a more conservative standpoint would likely opt for early dates and interpretations such as 'literary imagery', 'polemics', or 'missionary poem' for Ugaritic elements, as proposed by Gradl, Macholz, Fensham, et a/. 223lt would be interesting to reinvestigate Ginsberg's almost sixty year old hypothesis in the light of modern scholarship, since the points of contact between Psa 29 and Ugaritic material mentioned by him have to be evaluated differently from a modern perspective.224 Taking the condition of the text of Psa 29 into consideration, any structural analysis must remain provisional. However, we would agree with Kloos (1986) against Loretz (1984) in assuming a certain coherence for the poem,225 excluding the presence of an El-tradition and a Ba'al-tradition alongside each other (Mulder, 1989: 135). Furthermore, there are literary devices and structures present in the psalm that would point to a consistent
Kloos generally opts for a pre-exilic situation for Psa 29, but maintains that the psalm depicts Yahweh in accordance with Ba'al's characteristics, making him an Israelite Ba'al, while she cannot detect any El-traditions in the text. However, she assumes ''that
the psalm originated in Israel, and that its notions formed part of the Yahwistic creed" (1986:123f.).
222 Although Malamat proposes a relationship between the Ugaritic material and Psa 29, he traces its background further to Mesopotamia, linking it with the Gilgamesh Epic and the Foundation Inscription ofYahdun-Lim, King ofMari (1988:157); Mittmann seems to bypass the question of Canaanite literary dependency altogether, and after deleting the
later additions allegedly found in the psalm, comes to the conclusion that Psa 29 belongs to the group ofenthronement psalms (1978:192f.). 223 For further references, cf. Kloos' discussion ofthese interpretations (1986:94-98).
224 lt is interesting to note Loretz's conclusion in the update on his monograph Psalm 29. Kanaanäische EI- und Baaltraditionen in jüdischer Sicht (1984) about the relationship between the psalm and Ugaritic literature: "... es zeigte sich zunehmend, daß zwischen den ugaritischen Texten und Ps 29 doch so zahlreiche Differenzen bestehen, die eine kanaanistische Interpretation als falsch erweisen" (1988b:232). Furthermore he no longer upholds the combination of EI- and Ba'al-traditions and excludes an imagery of Ba'al in Psa 29 (1988b:195).
225 Freedman and Hyland try to demonstrate "the integrity of the present text" through a structural analysis of Psa 29 which is aimed at literary features, strophic patterns, syllable counts, grammatical peculiarities, etc. Thus the authors come to the following conclusion: "We may be confident that we have the hymn substantially as it was composed for liturgical use in early Israel" (1973:256).

thought pattem applied to the whole of the poem.226 The text of Psa 29 has a threefold structure (vss. 1-2; vss. 3-9b; vss. 9c-11) with a chiastic structure of division 1 and 3 as shown convincingly by Auffret: A {la) Partenaires = fils des dieux B (lb-2a) Acclarnations = gloire et force! + C (2b) Attitude= prosternement (des fils de dieux)
B' (9c) Acclamation = gloire! + C' (10) Attitude= assis (Yahve) A' (11) Partenairs = son peuple (a Iui Ja force) (Auffret, 1987:92) The central division coincides with the textual unit chosen for the purpose of the present study, and the eminent structural feature of the passage is found in the spatial dimensions mentioned in the text. As observed before in Psa 18, a definite dynamic movement takes place in the psalmist's description of the theophanic thunderstorm which is not only reflected in the geographic terms, but also in the choice of motion-oriented language.227

However, the identification of Kadesh, or the 'semi-desert Kadesh', has been the subject of wide discussion, since it could refer to a desert area close to Kadesh on the Orontes, as well as to the arid region in the Southem Negev, close to Kadesh Bamea.229 While one cannot rule out an underlying figurative meaning for the geographic allusions, it seems nevertheless clear that, in the poet's description of the thunderstorm, they follow a geographical progressive pattem, and do not serve as a mythological depiction of the Yahwistic thunderstorm in general (cf. Seybold, 1980:211). Interestingly, in vs. 10 the psalmist retums to the imagery of water which served as a point of departure in vs. 3.230
4.3.4.4. Comment on Psalm 29:3-9
After a call to praise directed toward the ••'?~ •p231 in vss. 1-2, the psalmist begins bis description ofthe thunderstorm in vs. 3.
229 In the current literature, a distinction is being made between a north- and a southsolution. For a northern topography the mentioning of Mt. Lebanon and Mt. Sirion and the progression of the thunderstorm from the Mediterranean over the mountains toward the adjoining desert can be adduced (Craigie, 1983:247). Notably, a northern geography is proposed by adherents to a Canaanite origin for the poem (cf. note 220), while a southern identification of Kadesh is generally followed by proponents of an Israelite origin for Psa 29 (cf notes 221 and 222). A southern locale seems attractive from its inclusive character by creating the circumference of Israel in mentioning its northern and southern horizons: "Libanon und Kadeswüste liegen offenbar im Horizont des Landes, in dem der Dichter des Psalms zu Hause ist" (Mittmann, 1978:184). Furthermore it solves the problem that Kadesh on the Orontes is not located in a semidesert region, and was not occupied between ca. 1200 B.C. and Seleucid times: "... the invasion of the Sea Peoples ca 1200 seems to have ended the historical record of Kadesh, and it remained unoccupied until a city named Laodicea was built on the remains during the Seleucid era" (Avalos, 1992b:4). Nevertheless, one cannot rule out a more mythological interpretation of the expression altogether (cf. note 200). Taking the overall geographical imagery into account, the northern geography seems more likely, whereas the geographical allusion may have served as a basis for an underlying mythological meaning.
230 The '?1::io in vs. 10 has been the subject of various discussions. Although it has been understood as a parallel to the motif ofBa'al sitting enthroned above the flood (Craigie, 1983:248), Loretz argues that the proposed parallels with Ugaritic texts do not withstand further scrutiny (1987:421), and that "mbwl 'Himmelsozean' ein Wort aus dem gewöhnlichen Sprachgebrauch hebräischer Kosmologie ist" (1988b:177). Furthermore, besides Psa 29:10, it only occurs in Gen 6-11 (12 times) in connection with the flood account denoting the 'flood', and that seems tobe the background which the psalmist had foremost in mind. Cf. also Tsumura who proposes an interesting temporal interpretation of'?1:::io'? meaning 'since before the deluge' (1988:354f.).
231 The identity ofthe t:l''?M •i::i is not altogether clear. lt constitutes one ofthe major points of evidence adduced for support of a Canaanite origin, supposedly denoting the Canaanite pantheon. For a thorough discussion of the opposite view of the matter, cf. Loretz (1988b:154-158) who argues against a direct relationship between the Hebrew

Vs. 3: As mentioned above the i1F ?ip refers to the approaching sound of thunder heard by the psalmist from a distance, but it goes beyond that in announcing Yahweh' s presence with an element of theophany and warfare (Deu 5:25; Isa 30:31). The imminent thunderstorm is described as coming
in from the Mediterranean, the •':;!J •:0.232 Beyond .a mere naturalistic description, vs. 3 has been seen as an allusion to Yahweh's supremacy over chaos as represented by the 'mighty waters', 233 a theme which is prevalent throughout the ANE and not exclusively Ugaritic. The mentioning of 7i:J:;,;:r-';,~ 'God of glory', i.e., the generic term ?~ in connection with a qualifier, and furthermore in parallel position to i1Ji1\ points to the fact that the expression was used as a divine epithet of Yahweh and cannot be seen as evidence for a separate El-tradition in Psa 29. Vs. 4: The psalmist continues the description of Yahweh's voice in a nominal sentence and attaches to it the attributes of i:r:i 'power' and 7'JiJ 'majesty' which are ultimately tobe ascribed to Yahweh.234 Vs. 5: As the thunderstorm moves inland over the Lebanon mountain range, its destructive effects are starting to show.235 Yahweh's voice 'breaks' and, in an intensified parallelism, 'shatters' the Ji:i~'p;:r 'f.";l~ 'cedars of Lebanon' which play a significant role in Israelite, but also Canaanite literature and,
and Ugaritic parallel expressions, and understands the phrase as a post-exilic term for 'angels'.
232 A climatic description of the wet season in Palestine supports the description of a thunderstorm reaching Palestine from the Mediterranean: "The wet season occurs when low pressure storm tracks over Europe are displaced more southward during the winter months. During this season, cyclonic storms move eastward through to the Mediterranean. Precipitation occurs mainly in the form of showers caused by the unstable air ofthe intruding cold fronts" (Raphael, 1992:970).
233 Cf. Görg's recent article about the forces of chaos in the OT in which he discusses various texts describing the Chaoskampf (1993:48-61). However, there is no indication of a mythological content in the text itself, and vs. 3 is foremost a description of the thunderstorm approaching from the West.
234 Dahood understands the preposition :::i preceding both nouns as an emphasizing article (1966: 177).
235 Hossfeld sees vss. 5-9a as a concentric ring-composition around vs. 7: vss. 5 and 9a show the effect of the thunderstorm on the vegetation, while vss. 6 and 8 describe the impact of an accompanying earthquake. Tue center is formed by vs. 7 describing the most dangerous effect of Yahweh's voice, i.e., the lightning and fire imagery. In this sequence he recognizes a feature of the theophany: "Typisch für sie [theophanies] sind die Dramatik des Vorgangs (die sich steigernde Trias von Sturm - Beben - Feuer vgl. 1 Kön 1911r), die nordpalästinensische Geographie (Libanon, Antilibanon und Ostwüste) und vor allem die mythischen Anspielungen bzw. Wurzeln der Bilder" (Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993:184; cf. also Macholz, 1980:329).

in a figurative sense, symbolize strength and stability (Job 40: 17; Psa 80:11; Sol 5:15).236 Vs. 6: The imagery of skipping mountains serves to describe the intensified results of the thunderstorm as it continues to stay over the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon237 regions. Yahweh's voice, denotative of bis presence, causes an earthquake-like effect on the topography of the area, an imagery also portrayed in Psa 114:4-6. lt becomes once more apparent that the poet transcends the mere naturalistic description of a thunderstorm over northem Palestine.238 Vs. 7: The monocolon describes the force of Yahweh's voice on the rocky surface, and invokes the imagery of lightning and fire as part of the divine thunderstorm which is an integral feature of the theophany and reminiscent of the warrior imagery.219 Vs. 8: The thunderstorm now moves on into the semi-desert Kadesh,240 while the exact identification ofthe location remains uncertain.241 lt appears that the poet intended to describe the dynamic movement and impact of the divine voice by means of it featuring in various geographic regions. Vs. 9: As a final effect ofYahweh's voice, its impact on the fauna and flora is demonstrated. The decision for the present translation is motivated by the choice of language, especially the verbal forms ',7.in; and "JrDCT~1 which promote a differentiation between the animal and plant world. While it is correct that the upheaval of the fauna does not constitute a feature of the theophany elsewhere (Mittmann, 1978:187), it occurs in our passage in the form of the comparisons in vs. 6. The verse concludes with a somewhat sudden retum to praise.
236 Cf a Ugaritic text in which Ba'al is described as felling the cedars (no mention of Lebanon, though) not by his voice, but with his right hand (KTU 1.4:vii.40; de Moor, 1987:64).
237 Tue usage of the Sidonian name riiD for Mt. Hermon would facilitate the suspicion that the author of the psalm followed a certain polemic purpose with his geographic description.
238 Craigie argues against a Canaanite textual background for the toponomy of the passage, but nevertheless assumes a polemic intention behind the imagery: "The language here is not drawn from Canaanite (Phoenician or Ugaritic) texts, but takes Canaanite symbols of stability and mocks them through a demonstration of their instability in the context of the Lord's thundering voice" (1983:247). 239 Cf. our remarks to Psa 18:15.
240 We would favour a geographic interpretation of l!iip ,::i,c over mythological or figurative explanations.
241 Tue northem locale remains the most probable one, although there certainly is a case for the southem solution as weil (cf. remarks above).

While the notion is correct that the motifs employed in Psa 29:3-9 find their counterparts in extra-biblical literature and iconography, caution should nevertheless be expressed against an overly simplistic interpretation of that evidence. lt appears that the Ugaritic parallels regarded from the perspective of recent biblical scholarship do not present such a strong case for a Phoenician origin of Psa 29 as when Ginsberg formulated his hypothesis in 1935.242 lt would then seem possible that the author used imagery commonly known from its general Palestinian background,243 but that he reworked it accordingly and filled it with a new content. The divergences from original Canaanite motifs found in the text seem to be of a sufficient weight to suppose such a procedure. Whether the purpose of such an intentional adaptation was of a polemic, ironic, or proselytizing nature, cannot be answered with certainty.244 As a final point in the discussion of this complex psalm, reference should be made to its classification as a text presenting primarily the God of heaven metaphor. Tue exegesis of the passage has made it clear once again that the differentiating line between the God of heaven and the warrior metaphor is a fine one, and that the imagery of the poem bears features of Hebrew war poetry combined with theophanic elements depicting the God of heaven.245
242 A good example is ',1:::io in Psa 29: 10; cf. note 230.
243 E.g., the thunderstorm theophany as known from the Canaanite Ba'al-Hadad (Macholz, 1980:329; Keel, 1972:192).
244 Mouhanna supports the notion of a polemic content for various psalms in his article, stating that the audience for which some of the psalms were intended, were both foreigners and Israelites who were tempted to abandon Yahwism (1996: 161-171).
245 Craigie observes: "Thus the language of storm and theophany in Psalm xxix is initially language used to describe Yahweh's prowess in battle" (1972:148). He continues to establish that the "Canaanite aspects of the psalm are partly to be understood as a continuation of the Canaanite motifs in the Song of the Sea [Exo 15], and partly to be understood as a deliberate use of Canaanite language in a sarcastic taunt against the defeated Canaanite foe" (1948:145). This brings us to the question of dating which we have neglected up to this point, since the psalm does not easily fit into any dating scheme. Adherents of the Ugaritic model normally date the psalm to the 12th century B.C. (Freedman, 1976:56), while a post-exilic date, based on a complex redactional development of the text, is also taken into consideration (Loretz, 1988b:150f.). While we have observed that the Ugaritic parallels are often inconclusive, we could nevertheless notice a certain coherence in the text of the psalm. From the close ·
similarities to the imagery employed in Psa 18, we would thus propose a tentative date for the psalm within the early monarchic period, i.e., the 10th or 9th century B.C.

4.3.5. Psalm 46:7-12
Psa 46 has been categorized as an eschatological Zionslied (Gunkel, 1975:81), centering around the interpretation of vs. 5 which describes the city of God, although the psalm possesses distinct features which differ from the remainder of the Songs of Zion (Psa 48, 76, 84, 87, and 122).246 For the purpose of the present study, we will bypass the issue of Zion theology normally discussed in connection with this psalm,247 and focus on the warrior imagery presented in vss. 7-12.248

246 "But whereas there are clear similarities between Ps 46 and the Songs of Zion, there are also grave problems with such a classification ofthe form. The implied association with Zion is to be found in v 5, with the reference to the 'city of God' and the 'holy dwelling place'; nevertheless, the psalm differs from the clearly established Songs of Zion in that it contains no explicit references to either Zion or Jerusalem" (Craigie, 1983:342). Spieckermann, in his recent article on the city of God in the ANE and OT also expresses hesitation in calling Psa 46 a Song of Zion: "Doch auch Ps 46 einen Zionspsalm zu nennen, heißt, der fehlenden Erwähnung des Zion oder des heiligen Berges keine Bedeutung beizumessen. Man gewinnt in Ps 46 jedoch nicht den Eindruck, die Erwähnung des Zion(berges) sei nur unbeabsichtigt unterblieben" (1992:27).
247 For a short introduction to Zion theology and the relevant literature, see van Gemeren (1991:354-357), who emphasizes its affinity to the depiction ofYahweh as warrior: "At the center of Zion theology is Yahweh, the Divine Warrior-King, whose kingdom extends to all creation ... but especially to his children" (1991:354).
248 The interpretation of the psalm is often dominated by vs. 5 and neglects the interesting presentation ofthe warrior metaphor found in vss. 7-12. Furthermore, although vss. 3-4 of the psalm clearly exhibit theophanic elements, there is no explicit reference to Yahweh being the cause ofsuch a turmoil ofnature: "Elsewhere in the OT the shaking, trembling, or melting of 'en;s-and the mountains appear to be caused by a theophany, whereas in Ps 46 their tumult is more naturally associated with the chaotic antagonism of the waters" (Kelly, 1970:306). Thus we have concentrated on the interpretation of vss. 7-12.

The text of Psa 46:7-12 is in a good condition and does not present major difficulties in the rendering of the passage.
4.3.5.2. The Language ofPsalm 46:7-12
The language employed in Psa 46:7-12 has been described as being "distinctively Hebrew" (Craigie, 1983:342), but nevertheless with a universal character (Weiss, 1961 :299f.). Before such statements can be evaluated adequately, attention should be given to the actual terminology used which statistically consists of 15 verbal and 28 nominal forms.
253 Many Hebrew mss, the Greek (Codex Alexandrinus and the Lucian recension) and the Syrian translations replace i11i1' with cm'?M (cf. Psa 66:5). The expression does not occur elsewhere except for Psa 46:9 and 66:5. 254 The point ofreference for itliM is i11i1' and not m'?ll!lD.
255 For the use of the perf. in a relative clause with attributive character, see Michel
(1960: 196, §31, 21 ). c:w could also be understood as a Qal participle which, however, would not alter our translation.
256 Dahood assumes motli to be an antonym to mon'?o in vs. 10, and thus identifies it with Ugaritic Imt 'fat, oil' which results in the reading 'who has put fertility in the earth' for vs. 9b (1966:281; cf. also Schweizer, 1986:111). There is, however, no compelling
reason to disregard MT in this instance and to expect in this vs. an antithesis to vs. 10. Furthermore, moo may also indicate an event that causes terrified wonder and astonishment, a meaning that is supported by the Greek translation TEpaw 'wonder, object ofwonder, omen', and fits the context adequately.
257 BHS suggests to read m'?JJJ1 'circular shield' which corresponds to the LXX translation 8upEous 'shield' (cf. also the Targumim). This vocalization is motivated by the context which describes pieces of weaponry. However, il?JJJ refers to a cart, wagon, or chariot which formed an integral part of the ANE war machinery in transporting supplies or serving as a mobile attack platform (Fretz, 1992:894).
258 The impfs. following the anouncement ofYahweh •'il?M '::>lM denote a synchronic action,
characterizing the expressions r1M::i •17M •'1l:J •nM as qualifying attributes of Yahweh (Weiss, 1961:298). 259 Missing in the Syrian and Greek translations.

Thus the proximity to the warrior metaphor becomes evident: "Tue premonarchical Israelite traditions which interpret the ark as a war palladium upon which the god of Israel was enthroned and from which he led the armies of Israel make explicit the association of the epithet 'Lord ofHosts' with the ark and with its military functions (1 Sam 17:45). Tue warrior imagery of the Lord of the heavenly armies, marching victoriously from war over his enemies, is clearly portrayed in Ps 24:8,10 where 'Yahweh of Hosts,' 'Yahweh strong and mighty,' the 'mighty warrior,' the 'king of glory,' is praised" (Mullen, 1992:303).

Table 12: Nominalforms inPsa 46:7-12
An examination of the language of Psa 46:7-12 shows that a distinct underlying Hebrew imagery has been involved in the composition of this
psalm: the raging •~iJ, i.e., non-Hebrew people (vs. 7a); the theophanic element of '?ip with its effect on the earth (vs. 7b); Yahweh as the divine warrior exemplified through the epithet ni~:;i~ illil~ (vss. Sa and 12a) and the use ofwar terminology in vss. 7-12; the allusion to the patriarchal covenant through ::Jj,,!?: •v'?t, (vs. Sb and 12b).265 Furthermore, the employed terminology has repeatedly displayed close affinities to the language used in the book of lsaiah which may contribute to the question of dating the
psalm.266 Finally, the recurring motif of n~ (altogether five times in the
265 lt is certainly not an easy undertaking to identify a tradition as 'Israelite', but in the case of Psa 46 the tenninology allows for such a categorization.
266 Neve has established the use of common traditions by the authors of Psa 46 and Isaiah, and comes to an interesting conclusion: "... in comparing Ps 46 and genuine Isaianic oracles, we have seen the numerous parallels in their common use of a great variety of traditions; in some cases these parallels have even extended to a common tenninology [e.g., Isa 33]; an even more striking fact was the discovery that in their common use of two traditions, the paradise river myth and the God is with us refrain, (l) no other psalm and no other prophetic book uses the God is with us refrain, (2) no other text in the Old Testament speaks of the paradise river as flowing into [all his italics] Jerusalem. This means that the direction of flow is peculiar to Ps 46 and Is 86 and can certainly be related to the hewing out of the underground water channel during the reign of King Hezekiah, an engineering feat mentioned alone by Isaiah among the prophetic books" (1974-75:245). Against that, Rendsburg assumes a northem origin for Psa 46, although the language of the psalm does not closely correspond to his methodological criteria for an lsraelite authorship (1990:59). However, while we would agree with Neve to propose a common language use for Psa 46 and Isaiah, we would be cautious to connect the psalm with an actual historic event.

psalm of which four occur in our passage) establishes a certain cosmic or universal character for the psalm (Weiss, 1961 :300).267
4.3.5.3. LiteraryAnalysis ofPsalm 46
A comprehensive literary analysis of Psa 46 has been provided by Weiss (1961:255-302; 1984:314-352; Auffret, 1989:323-341) and it becomes apparent that the psalm forms a literary unit, while a variety of poetic devices have been implemented by the author.268 Normally the psalm is divided into three stanzas with a recurring refrain:269
Vss. 2-4: 1. stanza God is our refuge We are safe in the upheaval ofnature
Vss. 5-8: 2. stanza
... God is our refuge
,.. The city ofGod is safe in the upheaval ofnations
Vss. 9-12: 3. stanza
... God is our refuge
,.. Because he has done astonishing things on earth
Graph 10: Literary structure ofPsa 46
This almost seif-evident structure of Psa 46 shows that the passage isolated for the present study does not correspond to the natural strophic division of the psalm, but has rather been chosen for its conceptual unity. Auffret also notices a division along the lines of content and comments with regard to the total structure of Psa 46: On voit que si en 2-7 Je centre 5 etait un tableau paisible de Ja ville, demeure de Dieu, en 7-12 Je centre 9-10 est Ja presentation, pourrait-on dire, d'une guerre a Ja guerre sur toute l'etendue de Ja terre, comme si Ja paix deja acquise pour Ja ville devait s'etendre a toute Ja terre.... Si terre (7) et montagnes (3-4) vont jusqu'a
267 Kelly understands the tension between distinct Israelite Zion tradition and universal character as a transition from the microcosmos, i.e., the city of God, to the cosmos, i.e., the earth (1970:309).
268 For examples of assonances, alliterations, recurring roots, various forms of parallelism, and chiasm, see Hunter (1987:63), who summarizes with regard to the poetic devices of Psa 46: "All these poetical features bind the psalm into a unity and its smaller part should be treated in the light ofthe unity ofthe psalm".
269 Tue suggestion has been made to insert the refrain :::ipi,• 'i1?~ ii'?-:::iJfDO ,ioi, m~:::i~ i11i1' (vss. 8 and 12) also after vs. 4 in order to create a poem with three symmetrical stanzas (Weiss, 1984:315), but we would agree with Zenger that such an emendation "entspringt 'neuzeitlichem' Harmoniebedürfnis" (Hossfeld and Zenger, 1993:285).

chanceler par Je fait du Dieu qui est pour nous (2) au-dedans de Ja ville (6), si !es nations et Ja terre, ebranlees (7), doivent se soumettre (11) par Je fait du Dieu de Jacob (8 et 12), c'est pourqu'au terme la terre entiere entre en partage de Ja paix que connait deja Ja ville (9-10 et 5) (1989:340). Thus Psa 46 can basically be divided into two conceptual units which are linked with each other: the city of God (vss. 2-6), which already has peace, is connected to the wider realm of tbe wbole eartb througb tbe mighty and astonishing acts of God described through tbe warrior metapbor in vss. 712, wbicb will establisb peace on tbe wbole eartb. Vss. 10-11 then form tbe symmetrical central part of the unit describing tbe i1Ji1~ ni'?P,;;i~.
4.3.5.4. Comment on Psalm 46:7-12
While vss. 2-6 describe tbe upbeaval of nature, and in contrast to that, tbe peace tbat tbe city of God enjoys througb God's presence, vs. 7 sbifts tbe focus of attention away from Israel and tbe city.270
Vs. 7: Referring back to vss. 3-4, it is now tbe •:i~ and ni:i'7r;io, as equivalents for non-Hebrew peoples, tbat are in turmoil. Audibly, they are roaring, enraged, but tbey are also losing tbeir secure stand and are slipping, because Yahweb raises bis '?ip. We bave repeatedly establisbed tbe association of Yahweb's voice witb bis appearance, and tbus a tbeopbanic element can be seen in tbis vs., especially as an expression allusive to God's acts of judgement, since it elaborates on the effect of tbe voice on tbe eartb, namely its 'melting away' (cf. Arno 9:5). However, tbe tbeophany is only mentioned implicitly and allusionarily, and tbe psalm as a whole, in our consideration, cannot be included witb the tbeopbanic psalms.271 Rather, the presence oftbe tbeopbanic element in tbis psalm once again sbows tbe affinity oftbe God ofheaven and warrior metapbors.
270 As noted above, vss. 3-4 often serve as an indicator for the presence ofthe Chaoskampfmotif in the present psalm. Mettinger develops the motif further, proposing a metamorphosis for the cultic tradition which is present in Psa 46: "the chaos battle becomes historicized and restated in a new form as the attack on Jerusalem by the peoples. This is the so-called Völkerkampf[his italics] motif, or motif ofthe battle ofthe peoples" (1985:27). However, as much as it is relevant to discuss the development of a certain motif, the assumption of the Chaoskampf-motif for Psa 46 shows the tendency to try to make a text fit into a certain pre-established pattern, i.e., to let it conform to the model of cultic mythological interpretation which, in the case of Psa 46, does not seem to find sufficient textual evidence, since Yahweh is not associated with the natural turmoil in vss. 3-4 whatsoever. While there might be no reference to a mythological
battle, the allusion to the roaring and foaming ••o certainly brings to mind the theme of creation.
271 Jeremias understands Psa 46:7 as the "älteste zweigliedrige Kurzform der Theophanieschilderungen" (1965: 126), apparently because it is the least developed passage referring to theophany. If 'brevity is equal to antiquity' stands to question, and Jeremias himself observes that the description of theophany in this psalm "dem Bericht

Vs. 8: Here the refrain occurs for the first time, and the conclusion of the second strophe is marked by a i1'79 at the end of the vs. The usage of the divine epithet ni1:1;:;i~ i11i1~ and its original association with the ark of the covenant, establish the usage of the warrior imagery in this vs. (cf. note 263). Furthermore, in the second colon the parallel expression :J~P,: •0',~ is
found, referring to the patriarchal covenantal tradition of Israel. :::i~rqo
'stronghold' serves as a qualifier for •'i:i?~, and may be allusive to the imagery of God's city in vss. 2-6 since it denotes a physical construction object, parallel to the i11?,r;J~ 'refuge, shelter' in vs. 2a.
Vs. 9: The two asyndetic imperatives m:r~::i'? at the beginning of the vs. are directed toward the audience ofthe author, inviting them tobe spectators of God's deeds. The ni~~ which Yahweh has done imply a strong element of astonishment, though with a negative connotation. Again, the imagery takes
on a universal dimension in setting n~ as the stage for Yahweh's deeds. Vs. 10: The language of war dominates this vs., though with an astonishing variation of the warrior imagery:272 Yahweh is portrayed as the one who brings wars to an end, not through fighting victoriously, but in destroying the war machinery depicted through the 'bow', the 'spear', and 'wagons'. The destruction is complete and thorough, since Yahweh 'shatters', 'breaks into pieces', and finally, 'bums with fire', which is the ultimate annihilating force. Vs. 11: A syndetic pair of imperatives with antithetical meanings opens this vs., encouraging the audience to 'let go' of whatever they are momentarily
doing273 and 'acknowledge' a programmatic •'i:i?~ •:;,J~-•:;>, i.e., that Yahweh is God,274 and that he is the one who puts an end to wars and brings peace to the earth.275 The vs. ends with a twofold universal exaltation of, i.e., God among the 'nations' and on the 'earth'. · Vs. 12: The psalm concludes with a repetition of the refrain from vs. 8; cf. there for a comment on vs. 12. Psa 46 depicts the warrior metaphor in the second conceptual unit of the psalm in vss. 7-12, though notably with a clearly irenic variation of the
von seinem Eingreifen gegen die wider den Zion anstürmenden Völker (Ps. 46,7) nutzbar gemacht wurde" (1965:158). 272 Perhaps this surprising turn of events is the motivator for the usage of n,Q!Zi in vs. 9.
273 Weiss correctly observes: "Der Imperativ ,:i,il hat kein Objekt, auch kein ausgesprochenes Subjekt. Das Fehlen des Subjekts und Objekts trägt zur Wirkung bei. Ein jeder soll ablassen von dem, woran er fiilschlicherweise festhält" (1961:297).
274 Comments van Gemeren: "The use ofthe independent pronoun 'I' in 'I am God' may be an elliptic form of 'I, Yahweh, am god"' (1991 :354).
275 Similar statements are found in Exo 14:14; 2Ch 20:15-17; and Psa 37:7. Isa 30:15; and Lam3:26.

motif.276 Yahweh destroys the weapons of war instead of using them.277 While the psalm as a whole includes allusions to early Israelite traditions (e.g., creation, the exodus, the patriarchal narratives), we could not detect sufficient evidence for the presence of the Chaoskampf motif as presented in extra-biblical literature.278 However, the presence of a development from chaos to order on a universal scale, or from war to peace with regard to city, nations, and finally to the whole earth, could be observed.
4.3.6. Psalm 65:10-14
lt is interesting to note that Psa 65 has been widely neglected in the scholarly debate during the past,279 although it presents in vss. 10-14 one of the most interesting depictions of Yahweh by means of the God of heaven metaphor. Only recently has the discussion been reopened through a thoughtful article by S. Schroer in which she concentrates on a "traditionsund motivgeschichtliche Untersuchung" (1990:286) of the psalm and observes with regard to our passage: "Die Verse 10-14 sprechen nämlich von JHWH als Wettergott und Regenbringer und zwar in der Tradition kanaanäischer Hymnen oder Beschwörungen des regenbringenden Baals" (1990:292).
276 Comments Brettler: "This suggests that when the metaphor 'YHWH is a warrior' is used, YHWH may act as a warrior in a way that is opposite to what is expected.... This overtuming of the expected entailments of the metaphor is not unusual of metaphors as applied to God in the Bible ..." (1993:146).
277 In trying to explain the variations of the biblical warrior metaphor, Clapham observes with regard to the mythopoeic antecedents of the motif of Yahweh the divine warrior: "Although depicted as the Divine Warrior and King, Yahweh is never a manifestation of or encompassed within any part of nature. Tue notion that the divine transcends every aspect of the universe is always assumed in Israel's treatment of Yahweh's relations with both history and nature. This feature alone radically distinguishes the Divine Warrior in biblical tradition from the same motif in adjacent cultures and produces important consequences" (1976: 116).
278 Mettinger is a strong proponent of the mythological interpretation of Psa 46 and may be taken as an example for this viewpoint (1985:26-29).
279 This apparent disinterest in the psalm is not easily explained, especially if one compares it with the abundance of bibliographical entries for such 'popular' psalms like Psa 29. lt seems that often the scholarly attention focuses on traditional 'hot spots' with the <langer of reiterating long-held viewpoints, without leaving known territory. Besides the prevailing commentaries, a representative bibliography of Psa 65 includes the following: Wiesmann (1935-36:242f.); Rinaldi (1968:113-122); Calmet (1965:24-32); cf. Schroer's remarks with regard to the exegetical value of these three articles (1990:285, n. 3). Furthermore, Delekat (1967:176-180); Crüsemann (1969:122-123; 192-193; 201-202); Petersen (1982:116-123); HaCohen (1987-88:179-183); Schroer (1990:285-301); and Goulder (1990:171-190).

Translation You have taken care280 ofthe land281 and you give overflowing282 to it, you make it exceedingly rich. The canal ofGod is füll ofwater. You provide her grain,283 for in such a way you prepare it.284 Watering285 its furrows, leveling286 its ridges.287 With heavy showers288 you soften it up, its sprouting you bless.
280 The tempora perf. - impf. + 1 - impf. in 10a and 1Ob refer to a narrative sequence with the perf. standing at the beginning of the line of thought, i.e., as the initiating action of which the following impfs. are a result. Cf. Michel who discusses the perf. - impf. + 1 construction: "Das perf. schien ein Faktum anzugeben, das absolut am Beginn einer Handlungsreihe steht oder losgelöst vom Gang der Handlung explizierend verweilt, das impf. es. dagegen schien nach dem perf. eine aus dem Faktum sich ergebende Handlung ... zu bezeichnen ..." (1960:21). Dahood understands the perfs. in vss. 10-14 as precatives expressing a wish which is, however, motivated by his view of the passage as a "prayer for rain" (1968: 114). lt appears best to indicate this sequence by translating the perfs. as past tense and the impfs. as present tense.
281 From the content ofthe vs. it becomes clear that the focus is not on the 'earth' as in vs. 9, but has shifted to the land of Palestine.
282 Tue Polei impf. occurs only here and the meaning is derived from the Hiphil occurrences in Joe 2:24 and 4:13 where it refers to the overflowing ofthe wine presses. The imagery seems to be that of rain falling onto the land in sufficiency. BHS suggests
with the LXX Kal EμE9ucras airriiv, which would correspond to a hy:pothetical Hiphil ötpt!im. Dahood understands the form as a denominative verb from p1t!i 'knee, thigh' and translates 'make her skip with mirth' (1968:109).
283 With the Syrohexapla we read mJ, instead of cm, with the suffix referring to ri~;i in 10a. The final o could be enclitic, rendering 'you provide grain', but probably not a
defective writing for a plural form since pi does not appear elsewhere in the plural in the OT.
284 With Schroer (1990:290, n. 13) we divide vs. 10 into five colons with a chiastic metric structure (3+2+4+2+3).
285 In our translation we try to correspond to the Piel inf. of the MT. Most translators take the inf. as a substitute for a Piel imp. (Tate, 1990:137) or vocalize it as a Piel imp. (Dahood, 1968:115) and render the colon 'drench/water its furrows'. Nevertheless, it seems possible to understand the Piel form as an inf. es. or inf. abs. as the subject of the
sentence (Jenni, 1981: 117f.) which elaborates on the way in which Yahweh prepares the land (vs. l0e).

4.3.6.2. The Language ofPsalm 65:10-14
The language employed in the passage under consideration is clearly influenced by agrarian terminology with pastoral descriptions forming the central imagery and wordfields (Schroer, 1990:290). There is a total count of 17 verbal and 21 nominal forms that are contained in Psa 65:10-14.295

288 Many Hebrew mss read the preposition ::, instead of :::i at the beginning of the word, creating a comparison 'like heavy showers you soften it up'. 289 For the translation ofthe perf. form see note 280.
290 Many commentators translate 'you have crowned the year with your goodness'. There is, however, no indication of such prepositional rendering in the text and it would disturb the construct chain 7n:::i1t!l nlt!i.
291 Dahood translates 'your pastures' as retlected in the rendering of the LXX Ta iTEfüa crou (1968:116). However, ',;;io in the OT denotes 'track, path, encampment' and not 'pasture'.
292 BHS suggests Niphal 1!l7l1' rendering the colon 'the pastures ofthe steppe are wet (with rain)'. Another possibility is the emendation 1l1'7' 'the pastures will shout for joy'. Both these variants seem tobe unnecessary, since vs. 13a connects logically to 12b and takes over the previous object.
293 The LXX reads ol Kptol Twv ;rpoßciTwv 'the rams of the flock' which would, however, require the construct ,,::, in the Hebrew Vorlage. MT seems to make sufficient sense to be retained and retains the parallelism to the 14b.
294 BHS suggests to move 14c to the end of 9 instead of 9d riin, but the colon fits into the content ofvs. 14 perfectly.
295 We have identified n:::i, (lOb) and ~',o (lOc) as adjectives, although they are, strictly speaking, nominal and verbal derivatives.

While p1r.o certainly has agricultural connotations, the evidence for ip:i is sparse (only Psa 80:15 and Jer 23:2 contain an allusion to farming, but no indication of rain), and irDll does not occur in an agricultural context whatsoever. Therefore, one · feels hesitant to understand vs. 10 as describing rain falling onto the land. This imagery has been reserved for vs. 11.

302 Tue reckoning of the year in pre-exilic times was apparently heavily influenced by the sequence of the agricultural seasons, beginning in autumn.

303 Often the Canaanite mythological imagery of God riding on his chariot through the land leaving tracks behind on the earth is connected to the 'nuo in vs. 12 (cf. Psa 18:11; 68:5,34).

Table 14: Nominalforms in Psa 65: 10-14
The language of Psa 65: 10-14 is distinctly characterized by agrarian terminology, depicting the basic farming activities of ancient Palestine, i.e., animal husbandry and agriculture, i.e., field farming. Furthermore, the geographical formation of the country is taken into consideration in the description: the author of the psalm is taking his audience from the grazing lands ofthe wildemess or steppe (on the Transjordan plateau, in the Negev, or in the Arabah), through the Judean hill-country (i.e., the Western central mountain range) toward the lowlands or broad valleys (i.e., the Shephelah or the coastal regions). Thus the three main geographical features of Palestine topography are evoked in the imagery of our passage.
4.3. 6.3. Literary Analysis ofPsalm 65
Before the literary composition of the psalm can be discussed, the unity of the poem should be addressed. The text has been described as consisting of two literary independent pieces (vss. 2-9 and vss. 10-14) which have been



118 4. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER
edited by a skillful redactor into one literary unit.304 The proposed disharmony is exhibited in the content of the two units: vss. 2-9 deals with a more universal imagery, namely, the nitQiJ that Yahweh will accomplish to the 'end of the earth' (cf. vs. 9), while vss. 10-14 are concerned with the agricultural fertility of the land of Palestine granted by God. However, in Psa 46, a similar twofold imagery is found: the city of God (vss. 5-6) versus the ni':'P,~Q of Yahweh which he in like fashion to Psa 65 accomplishes to the 'end ofthe earth' (vss. 7-12). In Psa 46 the unity is secured through the
consistent reappearance of the n~ motif throughout the whole psalm. In our opinion, a similar shift of focus takes place in Psa 65, though in reversed order. From the universal theme ofthe 'end of the earth' in vss. 29, the psalmist focuses on the land of Palestine in vss. 10-14, thus moving from macrocosmos to microcosmos. This seems to have been bis original
intention which is reflected in the artful change of meaning for n~ between
vss. 9 and 10. The text of the psalm thus exhibits a tripartite literary structure which is based on the content ofthe poem (see Graph 11).
Vss. 2-5: Praise to God in his temple (we-you)
l+ Vss. 6-9:
God 's mighty deeds an the earth
L. Vss. 10-14:
God gives fertility to the land (Israel)
Graph 11: Literary structure ofPsa 65
With regard to vss. 10-14, the question of literary dependency has to be raised. One of the main points of Schroer's article is the similarity of vss. 10-14 to a passage from the Keret Epic (KTU 1.16 III 1-10) which describes Ba'al as the giver of rain for the land.305 The similarities are predominantly concerned with the motifs and compositional structure
304 Petersen describes the formal differences between the two parts which have motivated the compositional view of Psa 65: "Während es in Ps 65 A allgemein um die Menschen geht und erzählt wird, wie gnädig und gütig Jahwe sich ihnen gegenüber erweist, setzt Ps 65 B mit v. l0aa neu ein und behandelt eine ganz spezielle Thematik: die Fruchtbarkeit des Ackerbodens [his italics] durch den von Jahwe geschenkten Regen" (1982:116; cf. Schroer, 1990:29lf.).
3os Schroer concludes after summarizing the similarities: "Als Fazit möchte ich festhalten, daß der dritte Teil des Psalms mit einiger Wahrscheinlichkeit ein Stück eines alten Baa.1Regen-Hymnus ist" (1990:294). However, at the same time, she observes: "Der Text einthält eine Menge von Unsicherheiten, weshalb ich auf Details hier nicht zuviel abstützen möchte. Es geht mir nicht darum, eine literarische Abhängigkeit von Ps 65, l 014 zu diesen Zeilen nachzuweisen" (1990:293).



4. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER 119
appearing in the texts. However, Schroer herself notices that there are differences and major uncertainties in the translation of the Ugaritic text which appear at crucial points.306 While we would not deny the similarities between the psalm and its Ugaritic counterpart, it nevertheless appears to us that the imagery portrayed in Psa 65:10-14 relates such a common experience of the agricultural-oriented inhabitants of the Levant that the points of convergence between the two texts should not be over-interpreted as indicating a common origin. Furthermore, the geographical descriptions of the passage in the psalm identified above clearly correspond to the Palestine topography, while the Ugaritic text only mentions a reconstructed tl[m] in line 11 which could refer to heights.307
4.3.6.4. Comment on Psalm 65:10-14
In vss. 2-5 the praise ofthe psalmist to God for his forgiveness is presented. The locale of praise, prayer, and forgiveness is depicted in the equivalents 'Zion' (vs. 2), 'your courts', 'your house', and 'your temple' (vs. 5). Vss. 6-9 shift the focus away from the temple area to God's universal deeds who 'establishes mountains' (vs. 7), 'stills the roaring seas' as much as in parallel position with the 'tumult of the peoples' (vs.8), is feared by the inhabitants of the whole earth, and makes moming and evening, i.e., the whole world, rejoicing (vs. 9). lt is interesting to note the corresponding imagery to Psa 46:7-12. Again, the chaos-motif is presented both in the creation- and the raging-people-imagery.308 Vs. 10: Again, a shift of locale is accomplished through the semantic
change of r:;,~ between vs. 9 and 10. Now, the land of Palestine, and more specifically its agricultural productive properties are, the focus of attention. We would retain the temporal quality of the perf. form l;171P-~, understanding the following as a prayer of thanksgiving which is in tune with the general tone of the psalm. God visiting the country is the initiating factor for all the
306 A comparison of the translation provided by Schroer with the outdated text published in ANET (Pritchard, 1969a:148) shows some astonishing differences: there is no mention ofthe 'well' in line 2, 4, and 9 in ANET, but 'n is translated with 'ploughland', viz., 'ploughmen' (cf. also De Moor, 1987:216f.) which takes away any similarities to the cl'i1',~ J',!l in Psa 65: 10. Schroer herself notices another crucial difference: "Festzuhalten ist, daß bei aller Ähnlichkeit der Psalm 65 das zu erwartende Stichwort 'Regen' (m;tr), das im Abschnitt des Keret-Epos viermals genannt wird, nicht nennt" (1990:295).
307 Interestingly, this line is altogether missing in ANET (Pritchard, 1969a:148), and should not be taken as a clear indicator for a geographical description.
308 One could also employ the common terminology of Chaoskampf and Völkerkampf
However, the Hiphil of the verb in vs. 9 (n::iw) does not evoke any war-like associations, rather, the opposite. God does not fight the chaos, but soothes it, stills it, unlike the normal depiction ofthese motifs in extra-biblical literature.

resulting goodness coming to the land (cf. Psa 8:5). He makes the land overflow (;:tpptvr;n) as the wine press overflows with the abundance of wine.309 The 'canal of God' has to be understood along the lines of a "conduit for rain water from reservoirs above the heavens down to the earth" (Tate, 1990: 143), and is equivalent to God's life-sustaining power, as expressed in the river flowing forth from Eden in Gen 2:10-14 (cf. Keel, 1972:122). The psalmist continues in 10d with the description of God's provisions for the land, i.e., 'grain', followed by an introduction to a further detailed portrayal of God's blessings in 1Oe. Vs. 11: We have retained the infs. in 1la, and understand the vs. as a more detailed description of God's blessing to the land. The rainfall drenches the furrows, softens up the dry ridges, and promotes the sprouting of the seeds in the soft soil. Besides a strictly agricultural language, the vs. also exhibits
some unexpected terminology such as nm i1D in 1la. Vs. 12: The 1!;,:;!it!l n~~ alludes to the continued presence of God's goodness throughout the yearly seasonal cycle,310 starting with the autumn rains.311 His 'tracks' ('",~.!;'r.i) which are dripping with 'fatness',312 refer to the visible remains of God's blessings, i.e., the effects of the rain which manifests itself in the heavy and sodden land. Where the rain has passed, God's tracks can be seen on the fertile land.313 Vs. 13: With i;i-;ir.i niti:~ the psalmist begins the description of God's agricultural blessings on the geography of Palestine. Moving from the semi-desert grazelands, which have also been blessed with rainfall, through the joyous central hill country, all nature seems tobe impersonated through the rainfall and its accompanying fertility (cf. Psa 96: 11; Isa 35: 1; 49: 13). Vs. 14: Finally, the broad valleys of the Shephelah are reached and the psalmist describes how they are 'clothed' and 'covered' with 'flocks' and 'com'. What was formerly bare and naked is now füll of growth and life. Psa 46: 10-14 uses the God of heaven metaphor to describe God as the giver of rain and fertility, a motif which is used repeatedly in the OT (Schroer,
309 We would suggest that there is no allusion to rain yet.
31° Cf. note 302.
311 The expression is often interpreted as an indicator for the Sitz im Leben of the psalm, i.e., the yearly autumn festival for which the psalm would have been recited (Tate, 1990:138f.). Against that, cf. Crüsemann's (1969:20lf.) considerations to the personal hymnic character of the psalm which does not fit a congregational setting for the psalm. Schroer concludes: "So zeigt die Formgeschichte, daß Psalm 65 eine recht eigenwillige Kreation ist, die an überlieferten Formen frei arbeitet" (1990:292).
312 J!!ii can refer to the oil ofthe olive tree (Jdg 9:9). Oil in turn is often associated with rain (Schroer, 1990:291 ). 313 Cf. note 303.

1990:297) though it is not a central aspect of the metaphor in the psalms. Though we would agree that the imagery of the psalm is a common motif in the traditions of the ancient Near East, we do not see the necessity of proposing a "kanaanäische Vergangenheit" for vss. 10-14 (Schroer, 1990:300),314 since the vss. describe a common oriental motif from a distinct Israelite perspective. The dating of the psalm remains somewhat uncertain, since it portrays an experience which was experienced again and again throughout the history of Israel. From its sequence in the Hebrew psalter and its correspondence to the language of Isaiah and other prophetic literature (cf. the semantic notes), a tentative date in the second half of the monarchy appears to be thinkable.315
4.3.7. Psalm 68:15-22
Psa 68 represents one ofthe most widely discussed316 and enigmatic texts in the Hebrew psalter,317 whereas the difficulties arise particularly from the
314 Schroer summarizes the theological and religious historical implications of her article: "Er ist ... ein kleines Zeugnis einer Zionstheologie, die keine Schwierigkeiten damit hatte, JHWH als Regenbringer zu verehren, ihm dieselben Eigenschaften zuzuschreiben wie die Kanaanäerlnnen ihrem Gott Baal. Es spricht einiges dafür, daß Ps 65 Zeugnis eines offenen, auf Integration bedachten JHWH-Glaubens ist, der Polemik gegen Baal nicht oder nicht mehr nötig hat, dessen Zentrum zwar der Kult von Jerusalem ist, der aber flihig ist, über die Mauern des Tempelbereichs hinauszuschauen und in der alten Sprache der Ackerbauer und Viehzüchter, in der Sprache Kanaans zu sprechen" (1990:301). Accordingly, Schroer dates the psalm into the exilic and post-exilic period (1990:299).
315 Psa 65 is often dated to the exilic or post-exilic period. This is, however, motivated by form-critical considerations which do not correspond to the somewhat free character of the poem. Goulder presents an interesting historical interpretation of Psa 65 in which he understands the poem as an answer to a prayer of David directed to God after he fled into exile to Mahanaim: following the death of Uriah, there was a continuing drought which was tobe considered a punishment by God for David's deeds. The whole tension had culminated in Absalom's rebellion, but then there came a divine thunderstorm to David's rescue, confirming divine forgiveness for his sins. Psa 65 reflects this situation (Goulder, 1990:171-178). While this view is certainly not in accordance with the mainstream of biblical scholarship, it provides an interesting scenario which would adequately explain the various themes presented in our psalm.
316 A short but representative bibliography to Psa 68 until 1990, which includes all the more important articles and monographs is given by Tate (1990:159f.).
317 Comments Kraus: "Es gibt im Psalter wohl kaum ein Lied, das in seiner Textverderbnis und Zusammenhanglosigkeit den Interpreten vor so große Aufgaben stellt wie Ps 68" (1960:468).

condition of the text318 and the question of an overall theme pervading the psalm, since it appears to be somewhat disconnected, with no unifying topic permeating the poem as a whole.319 Such a state of affairs justifies our approach to some degree, namely, to isolate a passage within the psalm which reflects both the God of heaven and warrior metaphors adequately. Since the structure of the psalm already presents a number of vexing problems, our selection may not be in tune with the normally proposed structural units (see below), but are derived from our statistical evaluation of metaphors of God in the psalms undertaken in chapter 3.
4.3. 7.1. Text and Translation ofPsalm 68:15-22

Cl'::;l'?I? ''J~ iDJ~9 15a When320 Shaddai321 scattered322 kings, qio7:;s:;i )~1;1 i'9 15b thereby it323 snowed324 on Zalmon.325
318 The text of Psa 68 has been described by various scholars as corrupt (see note 317), but the alleged textual corruption ofthe psalm is mainly due to the fact that there are a "high number of hapax legomena and low-frequency words in the psalm" (Tate, 1990: 170) which are not easily translated. Tate continues: "More than fifteen words and expressions in this psalm do not appear elsewhere in biblical literature. As many as two dozen words are used which are found less than twenty times in MT; half of them less than ten times" (1990: 170). Thus we will exhibit a certain bias toward MT, since the endeavour is to understand the transmitted text, and not to make it understandable from a certain scholarly perspective through emendations (cf. Keel's remarks with regard to vss. 12-15, 1977b:14f., n. 6).
319 Kraus summarizes the tendencies in approaching the psalm: "Seit geraumer Zeit gehen die Auffassungen, die zu diesem Psalm geäußert worden sind, weit auseinander. Dabei beobachtet man immer wieder die beiden entgegengesetzten Tendenzen: entweder das in seinem Grundgedanken nicht erfaßbare Lied zu atomisieren, es in einzelne disparate Stücke zu zerschlagen; oder die zusammenhanglosen Einzelteile von einer historischen oder kultischen Hypothese aus zu harmonisieren" (1960:468).
320 Inf. es. with :::i at the beginning of a sentence often takes on a temporal meaning (Jenni, 1981:119).
321 We retain 'itD in our translation as a divine name.
322 The Piel ofiD75l can also mean 'spread out', but in comparison to the second colon and the imagery offalling snow, the meaning 'scatter' appears more appropriate.
323 With Keel we disregard the accentuation of MT and understand .r:::i as belonging to the second colon of the vs. (1977b:17, n. 1; cf. also Fokkelman, 1990:74). Thus it refers back to iD75l:::l in the first colon (cf. Gen 24:14), and balances the meter (3+3).
324 BHS suggests to read J'?tli wm, 'like the melting of snow' instead of J?tlin .r:::i, but this does not seem to be necessary since the two verbs of the vs. complement each other in their imagery. Vs. 15 has been the subject of a variety of emendations (cf. Keel, 1977b:l3-15) which at times have nothing in common with the original MT, but usually are the result ofthe attempt to connect vs. 15 to the preceding vss. 12-14. However, if one understands vs. 15 as an introduction to the following vss., MT can be retained and even makes sense within the overall imagery of Bashan-mountains. Tue usage of impf. in this colon denotes a resulting action to the preceding colon.

A rnountain of gods326 is327 the rnountain of Bashan;328 A rnountain ofpeaks329 is the rnountain ofBashan. Why do you watch with envy,330 o rnountains with peaks, 331 the rnountain God has desired as his dwelling? 332 Yes, Yahweh will abide (there) forever. The chariots333 of God are twice ten-thousand,334 thousands of 'bright ones'.335 Adonai has corne frorn Sinai336 into the sanctuary.337
325 Taken as a geographical allusion, 110'?~ could refer to a hill near Shechern (Jdg 9:48) where no snow occurs, but also and rnore probably to Jebel ed-Druz, a rnountain "located in Transjordan on the borders ofBashan [which] has peaks rnore than 6000 feet high on which snow falls in winter" (Tate, 1990:166). Furtherrnore, the rock of that
rnountain is ofvolcanic origin with a dark appearance (•'?~ 'grow black') which creates a literary contrast with the falling snow.
326 As in lSa 14:15 the nomen regens Cl'i1?~ serves as an indicator for the superlative, or as an intensifier (cf. Joüon, 1991:525, §141, n.). However, the expression does not only fulfill a grarnrnatical purpose, but has to be seen in the context of vss. 16-17. Cornrnents Vlaardingerbroek: "M.i. hebben de vss 16 en 17 alleen dan goede zin, wanneer rnen er niet enkel beeldspraak in ziet, rnaar ook een weerspiegeling van een zekere strijd orn de voorrang tussen verschillende heiligdornrnen, of, beter gezegd, van de weerstanden waarop de centralisering van de cultus in Israel stuitte" (1973:75f.). Our translation follows Day which would fit the idea of rivalry and envy expressed in vs. 17 (Day,
1985:116).
327 We understand vs. 16 as a bipartite nominal sentence (cf. Joüon, 1991:568, §154, f), and not as a sequence offour vocatives (Tate, 1990: 161; Vlaardingerbroek, 1973:72).
328 Jtli:ni1 refers to the rnountainous area northeast of the Sea of Galilee with the Jebel edDruz lying on its Eastem extents. Bashan in vs. 23 has been interpreted as a narne for the rnythical sea serpent (e.g., Dahood, 1968:145; for other proponents of that translation, cf. Day, 1985:114). But the text of vs. 23 perfectly creates an antithetical parallelisrn between the rnountain 'Bashan' and the 'depth of the sea', and Bashan in vs. 23 should thus be understood as parallel to the usage of the sarne word in vs. 16. Tue identification ofBashan will be discussed below. 329 The •'JJ::JJ refer to rounded peaks associated with volcanic rnountains.
330 ,~, is a hapax legomenon, but its Pie) rneaning ('to watch stealthily or with envious hostility') appears to be well-established.
331 Cl'JJ::JJ has appositional character to Cl'1i1 and expresses a quality, i.e., the cone-like appearance ofthe peaks in the Bashan rnountain range {Joüon, 1991 :478, §131, c).
332 1ntli'? Cl'i1?~ ,cn in 17b is an asyndetic relative clause where the relative pronoun has been ornitted {Joüon, 1991:593-595, §158, a-d).
333 Vogt vocalizes ::J:11 as a participle of::J:11 'to ride' (1965b:460), but the irnagery of God's chariots seerns to be perfectly fitting here. The sing. form has to be understood in a collective way (cf. Exo 14:7).
334 Tue dual could be understood as a general indicator for plurality. Cornrnents Jenni: "Multiplikativa werden zum Teil durch das Fern. im Sing. ausgedrückt: nn~

335 Various translations have been proposed for ]Mltli (cf. Vlaardingerbroek, 1973:80-83). Tate (1990:161) follows Albright (1950:25) and translates 'thousands of warriors', but has to delete the M and propose a Ugaritic etymology from tnn "which designates a dass of archers/warriors who accompanied the chariots" (Tate, 1990: 166). Retaining MT, ]Mltli would mean 'the bright ones' from Mltli 'to shine' and maybe refer to the angelic hosts of Yahweh's army. This would to some extent also reflect the LXX rendering EWrivovvTwv 'those who thrive/prosper'.
336 Sinai could also be a divine epithet, a short version of 'l'O i1l •'öl?M 'God, the one of Sinai' from vs. 9. However, in the OT, it is always taken as a geographical term.
337 BHS suggests to read 'l'OO M::J 'he has come from Sinai' (cf. Deu 33:2) instead of 'l'O •:::i found in MT 'Adonai is among them, Sinai in holiness'. A final decision seems tobe difficult and both readings appear to be possible.
338 Literally: 'you took captives captive'. Tue imagery is that of taking prisoners of war (Vlaardingerbroek, 1973 :87).
339 The :::i is not understood as a bet essentia 'you received men as gifts' (Joüon, 1991 :486, §133, c), but rather causative or instrumental (cf. Gen 9:6; Num 31: 11).
340 BHS follows with its reading some Hebrew mss together with the Syriac translation,
while the edition ofthe Hebrew codices ofKennicott, de Rossi and Ginsburg reads 7M.
341 The Qal inf. cs. is not easily translated and the best option seems to take the prepositional force of';, into account (cf. Tate, 1990: 161).
342 BHS suggests •'öl?M öl' ptli? and proposes the Syrian translation for which the Hebrew
Vorlage would read •'öl?M 'l:l? 11:,t,;, M? 'they dwell not before God' or 'they do not submit to God'.
343 We understand •1' •1' as belonging to 20a which makes 20b grammatically independent (Fokkelmann, 1990:74).
344 In the sense of carrying a burden for someone. Cf. the reading of the LXX KaTEuo6wcm iiμ'iv 'he will prosper us'. Perhaps the imagery is God Ioading benefits on us, as a tradesman loads his donkey with products. 345 ';, replaces the genitive here (cf. Joüon, 1991:473, §130, a).
346 Normally, the term denotes the 'end of the boundaries' (cf. semantic notes below). Hauge suggests the following translation for 21b: "To Yahweh the Lord belongs the territory facing death" (1988b:5). He understands the mM~in as an ideological description for the boundaries around the sanctuary, and ;iw';, at the beginning of 21b as a designation for a special gate (Psa 118) into the temple area. Thus he links the vs. to a

The text of our passage has presented numerous problems which often resulted from a low frequency of occurrences for the respective word within the OT, but it has been shown that the attempt to follow MT in this case without major emendations can lead to a relatively coherent translation.
4.3. 7.2. The Language ofPsalm 68:15-22
A number of nominal sentences (vss. 16, 18, and 21) brings the total count of our passage to only 15 verbal forms, but 46 nominal forms which are, however, repetitious to some degree.

metaphors in this psalm, but we have taken this passage, since it represents a cross-section of the psalm in which the two metaphors appear in an overlapping fashion. Another interesting feature conceming the language of Psa 68: 15-22 is the
high frequency of divine names and epithets: 'JtP (lx), •'i:i?~ (5x), ;,F (2x),
•t1~ (3x), i=l; (lx), and ',~ (3x). These occur on their own or in combination with divine epithets, 356 while the rest of the psalm presents a similar picture.357
4. 3. 7. 3. Literary Analysis ofPsalm 68
The literary structure of the psalm is somewhat difficult to determine, since it appears to consist of a conglomerate of different images. This has led Albright (1950: 1-39) to the assumption that Psa 68 represents an index of beginning lines of early lsraelite poems (cf. note 357). Although there is no evidence within the OT for such a practice, numerous commentators have accepted this view of the psalm. On the other side of the spectrum of interpretation there are endeavours to emphasize the unity of the poem and demonstrate its underlying coherent theme or occasion.358 However, the Sitz im Leben for this poem remains to be highly doubtful359 which has induced scholars to approach the text from a more literary perspective. Fokkelman divides Psa 68 into three large sections (vss. 2-11; 12-24; and 25-36), eight stanzas, and sixteen strophes (1990:75). He solves the question of unity in demonstrating inclusio: vs. 5 II vs. 33-34. However, even the poetic structure is far from being consistent - one just has to look at the syllabic and colometric variations of the text Fokkelman provides (1990:74; cf.
356 For divine epithets, cf the semantic notes above.
357 For the distribution of divine names and epithets throughout Psa 68, cf. Freedman (1976:82-85) who correlates the variety ofdivine appellations to the hypothetical model proposed by Albright, i.e., Psa 68 is an index or "catalogue of Incipits or first lines of early Israelite songs dating from the period between the thirteenth and tenth centuries" (Freedman, 1976:82).
358 Tue question ofthe occasion for the psalm has been stressed to the expense of its subject matter. Gray identifies Psa 68 as a cantata for the Israelite autumn festival which originated in a cultic activity at Mount Tabor celebrating the victory of Zebulun and Naphtali in Jdg 4:6 (1977:20). Gray identifies Bashan in Psa 68 with Mt. Hermon which then in turn would point to Mt. Tabor (Psa 89: 13). However, there is no clear evidence for such an identification, rather, Bashan seems to refer to the mountainous area in Transjordan south ofMt. Herrnon.
359 Tate comments on general problems pertaining to the cultic understanding of psalms which becomes especially prominent in the interpretation of Psa 68: "The argumentation in the cultic interpretation of psalms suffers from a circular nature in which worship acts and contexts are reconstructed from the texts of the psalms themselves and then used to explain the texts from which they are derived" (1990:175).

Tate, 1990: 173), although it would not be correct to expect a clinically rigid poetic structure from Hebrew verse. We would nevertheless agree with Fokkelman et al. that Psa 68 represents a unity. Psa 68 lends itself to attempts of dating, since there are definite references to historical person groups, geographical names, and. other early Israelite poems. There is surprising consensus to date the psalm into the pre-exilic period, often as early as the beginning of the monarchy.360 Tue affinity to the Song of Deborah in Jdg 5 found in vss. 12-19 would facilitate a date between the 10th and 9th centuries B.C., i.e., during the Early Monarchy. lt appears advisable to approach the question of the structure of Psa 65 from a literary perspective, yet without trying to superimpose an inflexible structural system on it. The three sections mentioned by Fokkelman seem to reflect the general structure of Psa 65 (Graph 12).361
Vss. 2-11: Yahweh as warrior and as God ofheaven destroys the enemies and helps the oppressed, as can be seen in the Exodus and the conquest ofthe land
Vss. 12-24:
... Yahweh as warrior and as God ofheaven proclaims
.., the victoriy in the conquest ofthe land as exemplified in the 'passage 'from Bashan to the Zion (sanctuary)
Vss. 35-36:
... Yahweh as warrior and as God ofheaven is praised
... and acknowledged in his temple by a procession of
Israelite tribes, but also by the nations ofthe earth
Graph 12: Literary structure ofPsa 68
Since the passage in Psa 68: 15-22 has been isolated for statistical reasons (see above), there will be no further discussion of the structure of that passage, except for the fact that it forms part of the second section and thus reflects the theme of that part of the psalm.

conqueror of the land after he has led Israel out of Egypt through the desert (vss. 8-11). The imagery evokes associations with the battles connected to the conquest of the land.362 Keel has aptly summarized the exegetical meaning ofvss. 12-14:
Jahwe lässt sein "Theophanie-Wort" ergehen (Ps 46,7; 76,9; Jes 33,3...). Kaum ist es erklungen, wird eine Schar von Freudenbotinnen (Tauben) sichtbar, die die Botschaft von der Flucht der feindlichen Könige in alle Welt hinaus tragen soll. Auch wenn sich Israel, wie dereinst Ruben, passiv verhält, wird dieser Sieg doch errungen und die Taubenflügel werden für den Botenflug festlich geschmückt (1977b:36). 363
Vs. 15: Shaddai's364 victory over the 'kings' is illustrated by the falling snow on Mt. Zalmon.365 The parallel structure of the two verbs tD7El 'fo scatter' and J'?t!i 'to snow' soggest that Yahweh's deeds of judgement are reflected in the falling snow. In Job 38:22-23 an identification of snow with Yahweh'sjudgements is found.366 The imagery is enhanced furthermore by the contrast of the white snow as it covers the black volcanic rock of Mt. Zalmon, denoting the supremacy of Yahweh which is elaborated in the following vss. through the mountain motif. Vs. 16: From Mt. Zalmon in the preceding vs. the Bashan mountain range367 now comes into focus and is described in superlative terminology
(• 'i'.l?tr1;:r), alluding to the imagery of mountains as the dwelling ofthe gods
(cf. Isa 14:13). The Bashan mountains are portrayed as being •'~P~ 7;:r, i.e., mountains with many peaks which corresponds to the cone-like appearance of the volcanic peaks of the Bashan mountains. The geography is strictly Transjordan which would substantiate the interpretation of the preceding
362 If one takes the toponomy of the psalm into consideration, one could establish a relationship with the area ofTransjordan and the related battles (cf. Num 21:21-35; Deu 2:24-3:11).
363 Keel convincingly demonstrates that the .Jl1' •m::i 'wings of a dove' in vs. 14 do not refer to apart ofthe booty, nor to a bird-like object used in Israelite worship, or a standard of the goddess Astarte (for further interpretations, cf. Tate, 1990:179; Keel, 1977b:31-34), but rather should be understood as reference to the custom of omating the wings of doves after a victory and letting them fly as messengers of the good news (Keel, 1977b:34f.).
364 Although the etymology of•1tli remains uncertain, it is not astonishing to find this divine name connected to the imagery of mountains. 365 For an identification ofMt. Zalmon, cf. note 325.
366 More familiar is the identification of hail with God's judgement (cf. Isa 30:30; Eze 13:13).
367 The identification of Jtli:::i-,,1 with Mt. Tabor (on account of cm'?1n,1 as the 'mountain of God') does not convince, since ,,1 has to be understood in terms of a mountain range, as becomes apparent from the interchangeable pi. form in vs. 17. If Mt. Bashan in vs. 16 refers to Yahweh's chosen mountain, the whole contrast imagery of vss. 16-17 becomes superfluous (cf. Keel, 1977b:19f., n. 1).

passage as referring to the conquest battles East of the Jordan river. In the nominal sentence structure of vs. 16 the fourfold repetition of iiJ stands out.
Vs. 17: The four iiJ of vs. 16 are summarized in the sudden pi. •'~P~ •'".'\Q. We would suggest a strong polemic in the language usage of vss. 16-17. While the mountains of the gods are numerous and unspecified, Yahweh's mountain is only mentioned once and set in contrast with the other mountains by means of the added article which appears for the first time in
connection with the mountain motif (•'i:i7~ 70Q iQQ). In a personification of nature, the mountains of many peaks watch with envy the mountain God has chosen for his abode. Vs. 18: God has chosen Zion as his mountain, and he proceeds toward it in an entourage of the heavenly host. The warrior metaphor is represented in the depiction of God's innumerable chariots and his angelic forces, the 'bright ones', although this interpretation of )1$1tq has to remain a tentative one. As Israel has moved from the wildemess into the promised land, God moves from the mountain of the Exodus, i.e., Mt. Sinai, toward his sanctuary which is located on Mt. Zion.368
Vs. 19: God ascending to the height (•ii~7 ~•7-9) which is often used synonymously for heaven in the OT (cf. Job 16:19; Psa 71:19; 93:4; 102:20), is a motif which is indicative for the God of heaven metaphor.369 The imagery is that of an ancient Near Eastem victory procession during which 'captives' are displayed and tributes are received.370 Even those who
are in rebellion against God (•'".1';1iO) are ready to submit to the divine
authority of rr:.

369 Comments Jeremias on vss. 18-19: "In diesen Versen brechen alle räumlichen Schranken zusammen. Der Zion, in seiner äußerlichen Größe wenig eindrucksvoll (V. 16) und zu bestimmter geschichtlicher Stunde mit der Ladeüberführung von Jahwe als Wohnsitz gewählt, freilich nun 'für immer' (V. 17) - dieser Zion wird zum himmlischen Heiligtum. Der in ihn einziehende, von seinen unzähligen himmlischen Heerscharen begleitete Himmelsgott aber ist kein anderer als der unter der Erschütterung von Himmel und Erde als Helfer in der Wüste und in den Kämpfen der Frühzeit erfahrene 'Der vom Sinai' (V. 9; Ri 5, 5). Sinai, Zion und Himmel fließen im Heiligtum ineinander" (1987:77).
370 Isserlin discusses the well-known ivory plaque from Megiddo stemming from the 12'h century B.C. and its implications for Psa 68:14 which shows "a victorious ruler returning in triumph, preceded by music and followed by captives led along, while on the left he is shown having taken his seat on the royal throne" (1971 :5). Cf. also the relief of Sheshonk from Karnak which shows the god Amon presenting the pharaoh with captives (Keel, 1972:pl. 22).

emphasis on the uniqueness of the God of Israel.371 Tue imagery of 1~'?-0~~: is that of loading a carrier animal with goods on its back, i.e., God loading his blessings onto his people. Vs. 21: The ni~~;r-, n1~'? are 'death's extreme boundaries' and denote the control God has over death. Interestingly, the term i11$~ir-, is mostly used in the designation of the boundaries during the conquest and distribution of land(cf. Num 34:4,5,8,9,12; Jos 15:4,7,11; 16:3,8; 17:9,18; 18:12,14,19; and 19:14,22,29,33), and refers to the end of the territory. As God designated the boundaries between the people of Israel and their enemies, he also defines the boundaries between life and death.372 Thus another reference to the era of the conquest of the land is made here. Vs. 22: The final vs. of our passage once more stresses the warrior metaphor in using the well-known imagery of shattering the enemy' s head (cf. 32:42) which is repeated in parallel style in the second colon of the vs. (cf. Keel, 1972:27lf., fig. 397) while rno serves as the predicate for both colons. The breaking of the skull is a sign of subjugation and is rarely understood as a literal depiction of warfare. Vss. 23-24 continue the depiction of God as warrior, but the focus shifts to the recipients of his acts of deliverance, and thus are not of prime interest for our purposes. Psa 68: 15-22 represent an interesting overlapping depiction of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors centering around the imagery of the Exodus, the conquest, and the distribution of the land, especially from a Transjordan perspective. The mountain motif is presented via a dichotic depiction ofthe mountains of Bashan with many peaks (representing other gods?) versus the mountain of God where his sanctuary is located. As God has
371 Rendtorff, in a recent article, has examined the usage of ?M as an Israelite divine appellation in the OT which is motivated by the following considerations: "Das vorherrschende Interesse an den Beziehungen der israelitischen Religion zu der ihrer Nachbarn hat also m.E. zu einer Überbetonung bestimmter tatsächlicher oder vennuteter Parallelen zwischen biblischen und außerbiblischen Texten gefllhrt, wobei nicht selten der Kontext innerhalb der Hebräischen Bibel vernachlässigt wurde" (1994:5). He comes
to the conclusion that ?M in the OT functions as a generic tenn which is often qualified by a noun or an adjective, and cannot be interpreted from the perspective of a Canaanite divinity: "Allen unterschiedlichen Fonnen des Gebrauchs von ?M, die in diesem Abschnitt behandelt worden sind, ist gemeinsam, daß sie bestimmte charakterisierende
Aussagen über den einen Gott, Jhwh, machen. Das Wort ?M fungiert hier als eine allgemeine Bezeichnung fllr 'Gott', die es ennöglicht, durch hinzugefügte Attribute bestimmte Aspekte der Vorstellung davon, wie ein 'Gott' sein oder sich verhalten könnte, zu betonen und herauszustellen" (1994:11).
372 We find it difficult to understand mo as a reference to the Canaanite god Mot (Tate, 1990:181) which is Ba'al's counterpart in Canaanite mythology, since there is no indication ofmythologization ofthe text up to now.

accompanied Israel throughout their wanderings in the wildemess, he moves with them into the promised land and transfers the attributes of Sinai to Zion, namely, as being the mountain of God. This historical event has been commemorated and made available for the audience of the psalmist.
4.3.8. Psalm 83:14-18
Although Psa 83 does not belong to the group of psalms which are at the center of academic interest,373 it nevertheless depicts the God of heaven and warrior metaphors in an overlapping fashion, and should thus be included in our discussion.374 For the present study we will limit our exegetical considerations to the passage vss. 14-18.375

373 A !ist of recent publications dealing with Psa 83 as a whole, or with aspects of it, include the following: Buss (1963:382-392); Mac Laurin (1975:27-45); Costacurta (1983:518541); Lahav (1983:111-112); Ogden (1983:97-106); Margalith (1985:109-111); Gosse (1993:9-12); and Brettler (1993:135-165).
374 We would agree with Brettler who motivates his choice and/or exclusion ofpsalms for a discussion of the warrior metaphor: "... the focus of scholarship on the image of YHWH as warrior in Psalms 18, 24, and 68 has obscured the predominance of the metaphor's use throughout the Psalter" (1993: 139). Thus in our study we have tried to provide a representative choice of psalms which reflect the usage of the metaphor throughout the psalm. Although we have classified Psa 83 originally as belonging to the God of heaven metaphor, with Brettler we also notice the warrior metaphor as present in the psalm. The following discussion will confirm this classification.
375 We bypass the imagery of the enemy communicated in vss. 7-13 through geographical and personal names which mainly alludes to events during the time ofthe Judges.
376 Often '?J'?:o is translated 'like whirling dust' (Tate, 1990:343), but ?J?J refers rather to "the wheel-shaped dried calix of the thistle Gundelia Tournefortii which borne by the wind causes the shying ofhorses" (Koehler and Baumgartner, 1985:181).
377 With the Syrian translation, the Targumim, and the Vulgate, BHS suggests adding the conjunction at the beginning ofthe second colon as in vss. 15-18 and read iop::>1.
378 The two impfs. in vs. 15 are referring to the initial imp. in vs. 14, and are indicative of a substantial action (Michel, 1960: 111, §16, 4), and thus are rendered in the present tense as expressing a simultaneous action level.

The text of Psa 83:14-18 does not present any major problems for the transfation of the passage. The colons are consistently short and mostly of parallel structure.
4.3.8.2. The Language ofPsalm 83:14-18
Brettler observes with regard to the language of Psa 83: "Although terms from the semantic fields of strength never appear in the psalm, the image of God as a warrior is in the background throughout" (1993:150). Beyond Brettler, we would suggest that an examination of the 11 verbal and 14 nominal forms of our passage will demonstrate that the presence of the warrior metaphor does not only lie on concept-level, but is also reflected in the choice of language.

383 There have been various suggestions to emendate the second colon, since it does not seem to fit into the context of the first line. Dahood describes the reading of MT as "hardly amenable to coherent exegesis within the immediate context" (1968:277) and thus emends the colon to "and Jet your Name, Yahweh, avenge itself' (1968:273), drawing the final , of 1t!ip:l'1 to the following 7~t!i translating t!ip::i as 'avenge' (cf. Tate, 1990:344). There is, however, nothing in the text that would merit such an emendation which actually complicates MT intelligible reading unnecessarily.
384 Comments Dahood on the syllabic structure of the vs.: "The phrase '0de 'ad connects with both cola, and by hanging it in the middle ofthe verse we achieve an exact balance of 8:3 :8 syllables..." (1968:277). 385 Consistently we understand the impf. forms of vs. 18 as jussives.

Table 18: Nominalforms in Psa 83:14-18
The nominal forms of Psa 83: 14-18 display characteristics of the God of heaven metaphor, also with regard to theophanic features contained in the passage.387 A relationship in terminology could be established especially with Psa 29:3-9, the description of the divine thunderstorm: tzi~ (vs. 15 // Psa 29:7 et a/.), il~iJ'?. (vs. 15 // Psa 29:7), and 7.P:. (vs. 15 // Psa 29:9).

387 Jeremias includes Psa 83 with the texts that display a strong affinity to the theophany passages in the OT, but since they do not describe the actual appearance ofYahweh they cannot be added to the list oftheophanies in the OT (1965:7lf.).

The list of nations occurring in Psa 83 has been the subject of numerous discussions, whereas there is, however, no known historical incidence where the recorded nations united in an alliance against Israel (Tate, 1990:345). Gosse (1993:9-12) understands the mentioned nations as a postexilic continuation of the literary tradition of the 'Oracle against the Nations' found in the prophecies of Isaiah and Ezekiel,388 while other authors have attempted more historically inclined interpretations.389 While the list clearly alludes to the time of the Judges (vs. 10), it uses, in our consideration, historical motifs from that period in order to create the imagery of an Israel totally surrounded by enemies and their aggression390 against the small country (Haglund, 1984:61-63).391 In connection with the list of nations in Psa 83 is the question of dating the psalm. Although it uses old imagery, we would date it with Tate into the late pre-exilic period, since the language exhibits some characteristics of a more developed Hebrew verse technique (1990:345, 478f.). Since the threatening powers of that period are not mentioned, the author of the psalm might have used the historical motifs from the time of the Judges392 as a simile for a similar precarious situationjust before the exile.393
388 In comparing Psa 83 with lsa 17:12-14; 62:6-7; and Eze 21:37 (cf. Eze 25), Gosse comes to the following conclusion: "En conclusion, nous voyons que Je Ps 83 a ete
developpe a partir d'Is 62, 6-7 et qu'il est a situer dans Ja mouvance de Ja tradition des Oracles contre les Nations d'Isai:e et d'Ezechiel, dans Je cadre d'une justification de leur röle redactionnel" (1993: 12).
389 E.g., Lahav, who identifies the 11tlitnlJ in vs. 9 with a desert tribe mentioned in 2Sa 2:9 that invaded Israelite territory during the early monarchy, but which was conquered by Saul (cf. lCh 5:10,19-22). See also Margalith, who convincingly demonstrates that the
7tff]'l' ofvs. 11 could have already been in existence during the time ofthe Judges, and is not a historical imprecision (1985:110).
39° Costacurta identifies the aggression of the enemies against Israel as the most prominent motif in Psa 83, which is ultimately directed against the God of Israel: "II primo dato ehe emerge verte su Dio come vero destinatario dell'aggressione dei nemici" (1983:538).
391 Comments Tate: "Perhaps insufficient attention has been paid to the possibility that the peoples listed come from a rough circle around Israel, beginning in the south, up to the Transjordan region, over to Tyre (and Gebal), and back down the coast to Philistia" (1990:347).
392 Comments Haglund, who examines the historical motifs in the Hebrew psalter: "Ps 83 may be dated to the time prior to the Exile and refers to the time ofthe judges, i.e., to the time when the concept ofthe Holy War was vivid" (1984:126).
393 For further remarks on Iiterary features of Psa 83, cf. Costacurta (1983:518-521), who identifies various chiastic patterns and structures.

4.3.8.4. Comment on Psalm 83:14-18
After the repeated request in vss. 10-13 applies the model of early Israelite history in order to communicate and invoke Yahweh's supremacy over the nations, the psalmist now turns to the model of Yahweh employing natural forces for the subjugation of the enemies.394 Vs. 14: The vs. opens with the personalized address 'iJ?~, whereas the identity of that 'I' cannot be determined from the context.395 In using the imperative form i1'.:IO't9 the urgency of the situation is emphasized and God's authoritative action is requested. The comparisons '?i7~:;, and on-•~'? tliP-:;> stand in parallel position, and are referring to the imagery of plant parts
turned and whirled around (cf. the etymology of '?~'?~ 'wheel, whirlwind, thistledown') before gusts of violent wind. From Psa 18:11 and 77:19 it is evident that the whirlwind as a natural atmospheric event is closely associated with theophanic imagery and thus with the God of heaven metaphor. Vs. 15: 'Chaff' or 'stubble' is used in various places inconnection with the destruction through fire (lsa 5:24; 47:14; Oba 1:18; Mal 3:19), thus creating an effective link between the motifs of vs. 14 and 15. Fire consuming a forest and setting a mountain ablaze is part of the fire imagery which has repeatedly been employed as a communicator of the God of heaven metaphor (Psa 21:9-10; 29:7). Especially the affinity to Psa 29 becomes apparent, in which the destructive effects of a thunderstorm moving over Palestine are described and associated with the iljil~ '?ip. Vs. 16: Together with the preceding vs., this vs. forms a cumulative simile (cf. Watson, 1984:258f.), with the climax being expressed through the introductory p. While the foregoing images served as comparisons, now the natural forces of the divine storm are unleashed. Comments Brettler: "However, it is not clear if the 7.llO, 'tempest,' and i1El1D, 'storm,' are merely images for God's great strength as a warrior ..., in which he is given the destructive powers of nature itself, or whether these refer to a divine theophany as in Nah 1:3 ..." (1993:150). From the sentence structure (a series of comparisons in vss. 14-15, concluded by p in vs. 16), and from the fact that the psalmist is using jussive forms, we would soggest that vs. 16 is a request for an actual theophany, i.e., for an intervention of the God of heaven as a warrior on behalf of his surrounded people. We would agree with Brettler that here in this psalm Yahweh as warrior is not attributed
394 Vs. 13 has to be read in close connection to vs. 5, and describes the existential threat Israel is facing from the enemies.
395 If we hypothesize a pre-exilic setting with the imminent threat of national defeat, the speaker certainly could be the king oflsrael (cf. Tate, 1990:348).



142 4. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN IN TIIE HEBREW PSALTER
with human implements of war, but "has meteorological phenomena as his weapons" (1993:150). The force of the warrior imagery is furthermore enhanced through the choice of verbal forms in this vs.: "]7i 'pursue' and '?il::i 'terrify' which clearly are associated with war terminology (cf. semantic notes). Vs. 17: As part ofthe procedure ofwar, the humiliation ofthe enemy after his defeat is evoked in this vs., a similar situation as described in the imagery ofthe victory procession in Psa 68:19 (cf. our remarks there). Ji'?~ only appears here in the psalms, and is usually associated with Wisdom literature,396 while it denotes the utter humiliation and shame as a result of Yahweh's judgements (Jer 13:26; Hos 4:7).397 Nevertheless, the psalmist endeavours that the enemies will acknowledge Yahweh, i.e., ilJil', ":j~ ~t!iP,~:Vs. 18: The second colon of vs. 17 creates a certain tension with 18c - on the one hand the enemies are supposed to seek Yahweh's name (cf. also vs. 19), but on the other hand the psalmist wishes their utter destruction (7::lll in 18c). This ambiguity has been observed also in Psa 46 where the nations cease to be enemies through the acknowledgement of Yahweh's supremacy, who surprisingly does not destroy them, but terminates wars and destroys weapons instead of people. Consequently, the enemies lose their threat for Israel if they acknowledge Yahweh, if not, they are predestined for utter destruction. The sequence of the two verbal forms ~'?i'.;f:;!:l ~t!i:i:. serves as a hyperbolic hendiadys, expressing the utter humiliation ofthe enemy, although they are not completely synonymous. Psa 83 serves as a showpiece for the overlapping of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, and one can summarize with Brettler: Tue metaphor [God as warrior and as God ofheaven] allows the psalmist to expect YHWH's intervention (v. 2). lt is the reason why the nations who are Israel's enemies are explicitly called God's enemies (v. 3), and their conspiracy an alliance
396 Mac Laurin has connected Psa 83 with Babylonian incantation formulas used in exorcism, and tries to demonstrate that the superscription of Psa 83 "]O~'? is not referring to an individual, but to a "hereditary caste of professional musicians and prophets" (1975:39) which were functioning as exorcists. He concludes that "it seems not unlikely that the words Joseph and Asaph are connected with the concept of magic and may denote members of a guild of magicians of great antiquity" (1975:45). This, however, seems to be a very 'long shot', since there is no indicator of any magical rituals in our psalm whatsoever. Comments Weiser on the requests for the enemies' punishment in vss. 10-16: "Aber weder für die selbständige magische Kraft der Handlung noch des Wortes ist im Alten Testament Platz neben der alleinigen Macht Gottes; aus den einstigen Flüchen sind Bitten geworden und an Stelle der magischen Analogie ist die Aktualisierung des Gotteshandelns, die Vergegenwärtigung seiner heilsgeschichtlichen Rettungstaten getreten, mit denen er seine Macht über die Feinde erweisen soll" (1959:370).
397 Interestingly, in these references p'?p often appears, with openly displayed nakedness as the ultimate sign ofhumiliation in the ANE (cf. note 370).

(n'7::::l) against YHWH (v. 6). YHWH's past actions as warrior in Israel's behalfare recalled (vv. 10-11), and storm, fire, and possibly theophany imagery are used to express the divine weapons (1993:150f.).
4.3.9. Psalm 144:5-8
An exegetical discussion of Psa 144 may result in an exercise in relecture or anthology,398 since the psalm incorporates traditions from other psalms, foremost from Psa 18, although it soon becomes evident that the psalm did not borrow material in a mechanistic way, but rather regrouped and also reinterpreted it from a certain perspective.399 For the purpose of the present study it may thus be possible to trace a development of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors diachronically. We have isolated vss. 5-8 for our exegetical discussion, although vs. 8 does not contribute significantly to the understanding of our metaphors, but has been included since it connects grammatically to vs. 7.

398 Loretz has summarized the history of research for Psa 144 which has been dominated by the question of unity, while the proponents of an anthological interpretation favour the unity of the poem. Although the psalm is generally classified as a royal psalm, supposedly with a post-exilic date of origin, the question is if the description of the king in Psa 144 can be correlated to any existing monarch since the monarchy was no longer in existence at that time, or if we are dealing with an idealized view of kingship with messianic overtones as a sort of literary fiction (Loretz, 1988a:177-181). Besides Loretz's discussion (1988a:177-208; cf. also 209-224), studies on Psa 144 include the following: Baumann (1950:148-152); Habe! (1972:417-430); Eaton (1976:127f.); Haglund (1984:85f.); and Toumay (1984:520-530).
399 In saying that we already presuppose a dependency of Psa 144 on Psa 18, and not vice versa (e.g., Eaton, 1976:128). Tue linguistic evidence would point to such a direction of
development. Comments Baumann: "Das Lied ist keine einfache Nachahmung des 18. Psalms, im Einzelnen keine unmittelbare, mechanische Entlehnung. Es arbeitet zwar mit überkommenem Stoff, den es vornehmlich, aber keineswegs ausschließlich, dem 18. Psalm entnimmt, aber ist dabei auf straffste Zusammenfassung und zugleich auf Wechsel und scharfe Abgrenzung der Motive, ja auf Gegenüberstellung bedacht, wie sie nur in einer Komposition möglich ist" (1950:148).
400 Habel connects the Hiphil imp. of ilt:ll to creation terminology, denoting the pitching of the heavens as a "preparation of a unique domain of Yahweh for his heavenly theophanies. The heavens are 'pitched' tobe his cosmic tent where he appears in order to create ... Finally, the 'pitching' ofthe heavens by Yahweh is not merely viewed as a past primordial cosmic event, but also as a revelatio continua which is part ofhis creatio continua [his italics] and his saving intervention through cult or history" (1972:430).

However, the imagery seems more likely to refer to the preparatory action of spreading apart the clouds like a curtain in order to descend from heaven, although the language certainly is reminiscent of creation terminology and cannot be completely dissociated from it.
401 Two Hebrew mss., the LXX, the Syriac translation, and Targumim read ••ow instead of the personalized 7'0!Zi found in MT. This might be an attempt to adjust Psa 144 to Psa
18:10.
402 We understand ,,m as an indirect cohortative following a direct volitive mood
(imperative), expressing not consecution, but rather purpose as in Gen 27:4 (Joüon, 1991:381, §116). This would correspond to the parallel construction in Sb, and also clarify the action ofYahweh spreading apart the heavens.
403 There is a certain ambivalence in the usage of the personal suffixes in this vs. (cf. our comments on Psa 18:15). However, here in Psa 144 there is no mentioning of the enemies beforehand to which the suffixes could refer. Thus, we would take them with
Dahood as references to the preceding nouns (1970:330), understanding p,:::i as a collective sing.
404 As a context sensitive decision we take the sequence of imperative impf. Gussive) in this vs. as expressing consecutive action.
405 MT reads a dual here, but many mss. and the ancient versions have only the sing. form 71•.
406 From comparison with Psa 18:17 BHS suggests to read 'l!DOil 'take me' instead of the two imperatives •i',•:.m •i:.::i. Loretz follows this emendation and thus combines 7b and 7c, then he inserts 10c plus lla before 7d: "Der Text von V. 10 (Schluß) und 11 ist demnach als eine am Rande nachgetragene und dorthin geratene Variante von V. 7b.c zu verstehen" (1988a:190). This, however, does not seem necessary, and from our understanding of the psalm as an innovative reworking of older material, we would retain MT without trying to make it conform to Psa 18.
407 Tue expression refers to a "breach of political alliance earlier ratified by oath and accompanying gesture (cf. Deut 32:40)" (Allen, 1983:288).

The following agreements could be established: ilt:iJ vs. 5 II Psa 18: 1O; 77' vs. 5 II Psa 18: 1O; .im vs. 5 II Psa 104:32; ]fli.!l vs. 5 II Psa 104:32; r1s vs. 6 II Psa 18:15; n'?iv vs. 6 II Psa 18:15; '?~J vs. 7 II Psa 18:18,49. These parallels are, however, not verbatim, but exhibit various changes, such as the change of verbal conjugations (vs. 5 - t:iiJ Hiphil II Psa 18: 10 - CQ; Qal), but especially the verbal mood changes from the indicative in Psa 18 to the volitive in Psa 144 expressed by the various imperatives and jussives.

411 Day understands Psa 144:7 (Psa 18:17) as a historization of the chaos waters theme, namely, as an application to nations hostile toward Israel. According to him, the Chaoskampfmotifhas developed into the Völkerkampfmotifwhich has its Sitz im Leben in the annual autumn festival. Furthermore, he proposes a Canaanite origin for this motif mediated through specific Jebusite traditions (1985:183f.). He, however, comes to the following conclusion with regard to the mythological meaning ofthese motifs during the time of their usage and its possible demythologization to the level of poetic imagery: "One argument that may favour its having the nature of poetic symbolism is the diverse way in which the imagery is used, the fact that the imagery of the dragon and the sea is not only applied in connection with the creation of the world, but is also historicized, i.e., used to symbolize various hostile nations. In any case, when employed to denote foreign nations it has clearly attained the status of poetic metaphor" (1985: 188). When one takes the particular dates of composition for Psa 18 and 144 into consideration, one has to note that this process of demythologization took place at a rather early stage in Israelite history.

4. 3. 9. 3. Literary Analysis ofPsalm 144
The literary dependency of Psa 18 on other material from the Hebrew psalter is the major point of discussion in the interpretation of our psalm. Jeremias contends: "Der Verfasser des königlichen Klage- und Dankliedes Ps.144 war kein origineller Dichter" (1965 :25). However, in order to demonstrate the innovative character of Psa 144, the expressions displaying close affinities to other passages will be compared below, while differing formulations will be marked by italics in the English translation.413

These few examples suffice to demonstrate the psalmist's method of reworking older material, without resorting to verbatim quotations.414 While it would be interesting to attempt an interpretation of each of these differences, they show clearly that the author of Psa 144 modified his
412 For more parallels, also to various other psalms, cf. Brettler (1993:152f.) who summarizes: "However, Psalm 144 is not a hodgepodge of quotations. lt is wellstructured into a new unity, which praises YHWH the warrior (vv. 1-2); notes people's frailty, setting up an implicit need for divine help (vv. 3-4); requests aid from the warrior against foreigners who accuse the psalmist falsely (vv. 5-8); promises that if aided, he will sing to YHWH (v. 9); and then retums to the main them - a request for help, which Jargely restates vv. 7-8 (vv. 10-11)".
413 The identification of similarities does not merely lie on a lexicographical level (otherwise parallels would be abundant), but on the level of expressions and colons.
414 For more parallels, cf. Baumann (1950:148-152), Hunter (1989:103f.), and Toumay (1984:525-529).

literary originals according to a certain pattern.415 The variations normally concern the colometric level, whereas the individual components are often rearranged, keywords are replaced, and grammatical changes have been made. The fact that Psa 144 utilizes material from other, presumably older psalms, sheds some light on the question of dating, at least to the extent that this psalm clearly stands at the end of the line of development, since it represents a mixed form. Linguistically, there are also indicators which point to a post-exilic date for the psalm,416 although the vss. 1-11 seem to rehearse the theme of the Israelite monarchy, while vss. 12-15 offer a number of descriptive beatitudes which are reminiscent of the blessings of Moses found in Deu 33. The apparent disconnectedness between these two parts has led to the proposal of two different texts merged into one unit with vss. 1-11 reflecting a royal psalm of the late pre-exilic period, while vss. 12-15 iterate the longing of the post-exilic Israelite community for prosperity and Yahweh's blessings (Allen, 1983:291f.).417 We would suggest that the text of Psa 144 represents a unit which originated in the post-exilic community. The returning Jews used the theme of Yahweh training the king for battle as an idealized wish for the return of the monarchy, since the present form of government had not been accepted as a fait accompli. This was achieved through the presentation of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, reminiscent of the victories of the early monarchy and the invocation of the blessings associated with the conquest. The change from the indicatives in the Vorlage(n) of Psa 144 to its volitive moods would point to such an understanding. The overall literary structure of Psa 144 cannot be demonstrated clearly along strophic lines,418 but rather is correlated to the development of the psalm's content. The only structural repetitive element that could serve as a
415 E.g., the chiastic restructuring of Psa 18:15 in Psa 144:6, which appears to have been a literary poetic device also referred to as 'inverted quotation' (cf. Brettler, 1993:152f.).
416 There are definite indicators for a Iate date contained in Psa 144: e.g., m::::i with accusative as an Aramaism in vs. 7 and 11; ]l 'kind, sort' as a Persian Ioan-word in vs. 13; and the use of l!i as a relative pronoun in vs. 15. Furthermore, the position of the psalm in the last book of the Hebrew psalter reflects a chronological sequence to some extent and would point to a post-exilic date as weil.

4.3.9.4. Comment on Psalm 144:5-8
Our passage constitutes the central unit of Psa 144 in which the God of heaven and warrior metaphors are developed in a rather concentrated fashion. 420 Vs. 5: The invocation of Yahweh opens with a petition for his theophany in which he is requested to spread apart the protective cloud cover (~p;itft!liJ), in order to 'come down' (77'), as the terminus technicus for the descent of the God of heaven during the theophanic event. The second colon of the vs. refers to Psa 104:32, and develops the God of heaven metaphor further in describing the natural phenomenon that accompany the descent of God
419 Hunter proposes a sixfold division and identifies vs. 15 as the final sixth stanza which
refers back to vs. 2, i.e., the first stanza, with its use of •JJ forming a kind of inclusio (1987: 110).
420 Although vs. 1 does not belang to our passage, it nevertheless uses the warrior metaphor from an interesting perspective: 'blessed be Yahweh who trains my hands for battle, and my fingers for war' enhances our understanding of the warrior metaphor in the respect that "YHWH as the supreme warrior can teach people how to fight properly" (Brettler, 1993: 153). The technical description of the training of hands and fingers for warfare is commented upon by Baumann: "Es kommt bei der Handhabung von Bogen und Pfeil im Kampfesgetümmel des ersten Angriffs und wieder der schnellen Verfolgung weniger darauf an, daß man überhaupt den Bogen spannt (mit den Armen 18 35), als wie die Finger Pfeil und Bogensehnen zielsicher handhaben" (1950:150).

(Exo 19: 18; cf. also Psa 29:7). lt is interesting to note the innovative combination of the descent and the mountain motifs which has taken place in Psa 144, both of which are features that we have discussed in this part of the study before. Vs. 6: The vs. is a chiastic reworking of Psa 18: 15 and serves as an invocation of Yahweh as warrior. However, since the imagery is that of lightning associated with the natural phenomenon of a thunderstorm (cf. our comment on Psa 18:15), it can be inferred that God as warrior does not use human weapons, but meteorological phenomena (cf. Weinfeld, 1986:121-147) as already seen in Psa 83. Although the language is anthropomorphic, military oriented, and apparently referring to the shooting of arrows, from the parallelism to the preceding colon we would
understand the ~r;;r:r as descriptions of lightning which is scattered all over the sky.421 The ambiguity remains, however, and may express the intentional hesitancy ofthe psalmist to ascribe human weaponry to Yahweh (cf. Brettler, 1993: 155). Vss. 7-8: The n'?ili at the beginning of the vs. connects vs. 7 to the preceding imagery with the difference that Yahweh is now requested to send his hands to the rescue of the psalmist, rather than to send his arrows for the
destruction of the enemy. •i7Q again shifts the focus to the God of heaven
metaphor, whereas the •''.;:!J D:O are an emphatic poetical symbolic device with mythological antecedents for the expression of the encompassing <langer, as Day has demonstrated (cf. note 411). The main complaint of the psalmist seems to be directed against 1:;i~ 'P 'the foreigners' who speak deceptively and bring forth false accusations (vs. 8). Thus, Psa 144 is a post-exilic request for the intervention of Yahweh on the behalf of the Jews who have returned from exile, illustrated via the reutilization of older traditions, i.e., the victories with theophanic intervention experienced during the early monarchy (vss. 5-8, resp. 1-11), and the reiteration of the covenantal blessings similar to the blessings of Moses (vss. 12-15). Although the God of heaven and warrior metaphors are recurring motifs, definite changes and adaptations have been made to fit a new context. What has been a descriptive praise now becomes a volitive request, trying to revitalize a lost historical reality.
421 The personal suffixes in vs. 6 are reflexive, and refer to the nominal forms in the same vs.

4.3.10. Summary
A short summary of the main points isolated in the exegesis of the eight psalms will be presented, followed by a statistical evaluation of the semantic notes with the intention to possibly identify overlapping features in the usage of language for the God of heaven and warrior metaphors. (1) Psalm 18:8-16: The passage belongs to the group of psalms representing both the God of heaven and warrior metaphors in a mixed style. While the text-critical significance ofthe passage as a double text (= 2Sa 22:8-16) has been noted, the theophanic event of Yahweh' s descent from heaven by means of a presentation of natural phenomena constitutes the main element of the pericope. The spatial dimensions expressed in the literary structure of vss. 8-16 exhibit a certain sequence from above to below. This spatial imagery forms an integral part of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors. In response to the psalmist's affliction the foundations of the earth are shaken as in an earthquake, and Yahweh' s anger is depicted anthropomorphically using fire imagery, while the language is reminiscent of the Sinai revelation. Yahweh is spreading apart the clouds like a curtain, riding on the cherubim as on a war chariot. He remains, however, the deus absconditus with the cloud cover under his feet from which hail, thunder, and lightning emanate in the form of Yahweh's meteorological weapons against the king's enemies. The spatial cycle concludes with the effect Yahweh's theophany has on the foundations ofthe earth. (2) Psalm 21:9-13: The warrior metaphor is the demarcating factor for the passage in Psa 21, which is evidently demonstrated by the choice of a warfare-oriented language. A clustering of imagery can be observed in vss. 9-13, centering around the various ways by which Yahweh is described to attack the enemies. After seizing the enemies in an almost physical manner, they are subjected to a form of capital punishment known throughout the ANE, i.e., the fiery fumace which again elaborates on the fire imagery. As a religious dimension of warfare, the offspring of the enemy is completely annihilated, a practice reminiscent of the Conquest and early Monarchie periods in Israel. Although the enemies have attempted to plot against Yahweh, they do not succeed, and are finally subdued through the turning of their shoulder, and the aiming of the bow against their faces. While the passage is almost exaggerate in its metaphorical language,422 the protection
422 The enemies do not only undergo one form of punishment, but are subjected to such a number of inflictions of which only one would be necessary to lead to their complete destruction.



4. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER 153
of the king against his enemies is clearly communicated via the warrior metaphor. (3) Psalm 29:3-9: Although we have classified Psa 29:3-9 originally as belonging to the class of psalms representing the God of heaven metaphor, the exegetical discussion has shown that the passage clearly reveals characteristics of the warrior imagery as well, thus demonstrating the close affinity between the two metaphors. The central motif of the passage is the 'voice of Yahweh', i.e., the sound of the approaching thunderstorm, which serves as the instrument of his appearance, but also of his involvement as a warrior. Again, spatial imagery is used in describing the progress of the thunderstorm from the Mediterranean, toward inland via Mt. Lebanon, Mt. Hermon, and finally into the desert Kadesh, thus favouring a northern toponomy for the movement of the storm. While the geographical allusions in the psalm are taken from actual Syro-Palestinian geography, an underlying figurative meaning cannot be excluded. As the thunderstorm forms over the Mediterranean, the 'mighty waters' indicate the presence of the chaos motif with a strong emphasis on Yahweh's supremacy. Moving inland, the effects of the storm are demonstrable on the fauna and flora of the countryside. Especially the mountains, otherwise a symbol of strength and stability in ANE mythology, are subjected to the divine thunderstorm. lt appears advisable to reconsider the alleged Ugaritic parallels of the poem from the perspective of modern scholarship, proposing that the author of the psalm used commonly known Canaanite/Palestinian imagery, and reworked it according to his specific intentions. (4) Psalm 46:7-12: The passage focuses predominantly on the warrior metaphor, but creates a surprising departure from the expected imagery. Concerning the language of vss. 7-12, a universal or cosmic character can be observed, although from a distinct Israelite perspective. Again, the theophanic element of Yahweh's voice is introduced with the accompanying effect on the whole inhabited earth, but at first directed against the non-Israelite nations and peoples. In the twice-appearing refrain, Yahweh is associated with the Israelite traditions of the patriarchal covenant and the ark of covenant, both reflecting the warrior imagery. The perspective is once more broadened to the whole earth, demonstrating Yahweh's astonishing and terrifying deeds on it, which are, contrary to expectation, of a rather irenic nature, nevertheless, with warlike overtones. Although the destructional element is present, it is not directed against an enemy, but against the implements of warfare which Yahweh destroys with utmost efficiency. The demonstration of Yahweh's efficiency in putting a permanent end to warfare, is followed by an acknowledgement of his supremacy on a universal scale. A number of sequential units can be

observed throughout the whole psalm, e.g., from chaos to order, from war to peace, or from regional to universal consequences. (5) Psalm 65:10-14: Although Psa 65 has been neglected to some extent in the scholarly debate, the recent discussion has shown that the God of heaven metaphor lies at the center of the imagery employed in this psalm. The language of vss. 10-14 is saturated by agrarian terminology, while some unexpected combinations of terms from normally far-removed semantic domains occur. Part of the imagery is influenced by the geographical peculiarities of Palestine which function as a colourful backdrop for the content of the passage. Yahweh visiting the land is the origin of all goodness bestowed upon the region: there is an abundance of rain, which is the main factor in the annual circle of growth and fertility. Grain is provided by ways of preparing the fields with rain showers, furthering the sprouting of the young shoots, and wherever Yahweh's goodness passes, tracks of blessing and fertility remain. The psalmist describes the effects of God's agricultural blessings on the various climatic regions of Palestine, which are all exuberant with new life. The notion of Yahweh being the giver of fertility and growth is the description of a common Levantine experience against the background of an agrarian society from an Israelite perspective. (6) Psalm 68: 15-22: While Psa 68 remains one of the more problematic psalms, the imagery of the selected passage reflects both the God of heaven and warrior metaphors. Central to the imagery of vss. 15-22 is the 'mountain' motif which appears repeatedly, creating an antithetical pair between the mountains of the gods and Yahweh' s mountain which, in the final analysis, is equivalent to his sanctuary on Mt. Zion. The geographical locale for the passage is at first the Transjordan region which creates an allusion to the battles of the Conquest period east of the Jordan river. As the mountains of the gods watch Yahweh's choice of his mountain with envy, he proceeds toward it in an entourage of the heavenly host and war chariots resembling an ANE victory procession. In tune with such an imagery, Yahweh takes prisoners of war and receives gifts from humankind, and is praised continuously for his deliverance which even controls death. Retuming once more to the warrior metaphor, the passage concludes with an image of Yahweh's ultimate dominion and the subjugation ofthe enemy via the motif of the smiting god who is shattering the enemy's head. Psa 68: 15-22 evokes a number of early Israelite traditions, integrating them into a description of his taking up residence in his one and only sanctuary in contrast to the varied and minor dwellings of other gods. (7) Psalm 83:14-18: This psalm retums to the description of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors via natural, viz., meteorological phenomena.



4. GOD AS WARRIOR AND AS GOD OF HEAVEN IN THE HEBREW PSALTER 15 5
The choice of language exhibits affinities to the description of the divine thunderstorm of Psa 29 with a number of distinct parallels. Yahweh is invoked to attack the enemy in the form of a whirlwind which scatters them like chaff before the wind, followed by the request to destroy the enemy through fire. Again, the fire imagery is used and its destructive effect on the vegetation and countryside is likened to the effect of Yahweh's divine storm. In an intensification of the imagery, the storm becomes Yahweh's actual weapon in his fight against the psalmist's enemy, while the author is requesting a theophany of the God of heaven as a warrior on behalf of his people. As a sign of utter defeat the enemy is to be humiliated after the victory, although the ultimate purpose behind this process is the acknowledgement of Yahweh. (8) Psalm 144:5-8: As a passage which incorporates material from other psalms (predominantly from Psa 18 and Psa 104), vss. 5-8 focus on both the God of heaven and warrior metaphors. Although the parallels between Psa 144 and Psa 18, viz., Psa 104 appear tobe at times verbatim, there are distinct changes, such as change of verbal conjugations, verbal moods, or the replacement of certain key words. Placing these parallels alongside each other, it becomes apparent that the author of Psa 144:5-8 reworked and regrouped the material he used in accordance with his literary and rhetorical intentions which are possibly motivated by the historical background of the post-exilic Jewish community. Yahweh's descent from heaven is evoked similar to the theophany in Psa 18, combining the imagery, however, with the mountain motif. He is furthermore requested to use his meteorological weapons, especially the lightning which resembles the form of an arrow. Shifting the focus to the above, Yahweh is evoked to save the psalmist from the 'mighty waters' which are reminiscent of the chaos imagery in parallel stance to the foreigners which present themselves as a chaotic force. With regard to the verbal forms appearing in the selected passages of the eight psalms under discussion, the following observations can be made, while only the lemmas occurring in more than one psalm are considered. lt becomes apparent that the distribution of verbal lemmas is too loosely scattered in order to allow any conclusions. Most of the twofold occurrences are caused by the literary relationship between Psa 18 and 144, and only the verb used in the description of the theophany, i.e., il~J 'to stretch, spread out, bow', occurs in more than two psalms, being relevant to the present study.423
423 mLi also occurs in more than two psalms, but its usage is too common to be of any significance.

Before the extra-biblical evidence with regard to the God of heaven and divine warrior motifs will be examined, some general remarks about the relationship between iconography and biblical metaphors should be made, which will include an introduction to the contribution of iconography to the realm of biblical studies, followed by a short introductory discussion of the source material gathered.
5.1. INTRODUCTION: ICONOGRAPHY AND BIBLICAL METAPHORS
Although the reception of iconographic material and the literary device of a metaphorical expression lie on two different levels, i.e., the visual and the cognitive, they nevertheless are closely interrelated with each other, since a metaphor is able to create a cognitive imagery which might correspond to or be influenced by associations to iconographic depictions. The biblical ward and literary imagery have repeatedly been related to iconographic sources of the ANE, 1 but the resulting works have often not been able to go beyond the level of providing mere illustrations for the biblical texts.2 While it is certainly correct to identify the early attempts of biblical iconographic research as such, there has nevertheless been a steady development in methodology that has enhanced the relevance of that branch of biblical studies. The results and advantages of an iconographic approach to the biblical text have been demonstrated through a number of publications associated with
1 Keel traces the historical development of iconography and its contribution to the study of the biblical text (1992a:361-369), and its role in present biblical scholarship ( 1992a:369-3 72).
2 Beach in an unpublished doctoral dissertation entitled Image & Word: lconology in the interpretation of Hebrew scriptures has examined the various resources the biblical scholar can utilize, and categorizes them as follows (1991 :39-48): (1) picture collections which serve primarily as illustrators to the biblical text - here she also includes Keel' s Die Welt der altorientalischen Bildsymbolik und das Alte Testament; (2) encyclopedias which are often influenced by "certain Jewish and Christian theological traditions" (1991:43) and are usually biased toward the biblical text; (3) sample archaeological treatments which are the remaining resource and often are the only means, though sometimes not easily accessed, to get an overall picture.

the Biblical Institute at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.3 The fact that Keel's widely cited Die Welt der altorientalischen Bildsymbolik und das Alte Testament (1972)4 focused on the Hebrew psalter shows the suitability of that corpus of texts for iconographic comparison.5 More recent publications have moved from mere biblical theme oriented studies6 toward a primary concem of the iconographic evidence as such with its consequential bearing on the religious history of ancient Israel.7 In the same way, the focus has shifted from exegetical issues to the synthesizing and integration of iconographic evidence into an overall picture of the religious belief of ancient Israel: "Was aber die Rekonstruktion der religiösen Vorstellungswelt (belief) [their italics] betrifft, um die sich die hier angebotene Studie in erster Linie bemüht, so weisen wir die einseitige
Comments Roberts with regard to the contribution of iconography to biblical studies: "Even more impressive, however, has been Othmar Keel's series of exciting exegetical studies ... which have systematically incorporated the pictorial evidence, including that of the seals, into the exegetical process. This is perhaps the most promising direction taken in recent biblical scholarship's use ofthe comparative material. One can only hope that scholars will begin to give serious attention to non-epigraphic evidence in a more self-critical fashion" (1985 :95; cf. also Quaegebeur, 1989:72f. ).
4 As in Keel's work we will use line-drawings for the present study which will facilitate the recognition of the various motifs, although the danger of an erroneous copied detail cannot be excluded. Comments Keel: "Sie [line-drawings] machen Arbeiten dieser Art trotz der hohen Zahl von Abbildungen noch erschwinglich, und zahlreiche Details sind auf den Zeichnungen besonders für ein ungeübtes Auge rascher und sicherer zu erkennen als auf photographischen Wiedergaben mittlerer Qualität" (1977a:14, n. 9; cf. also the criticism ofLoretz, 1974:512).
The purpose of the study was stated as follows: "Sie [the study] hat sich vielmehr die Aufgabe gestellt, in einer Art Übersichtsbericht (survey) ein möglichst breites Bildmaterial leicht zugänglich zu machen und (im fortlaufenden Text) auf Ähnlichkeiten zwischen der Problemlage und Vorstellungswelt dieser Bilder und jener der Pss hinzuweisen. Dabei ist in den wenigsten Fällen an die an sich mögliche (historisch faßbare) Abhängigkeit eines Ps-Verses von der ao Bildkunst gedacht, sondern es handelt sich um das Aufzeigen gleicher, ähnlicher oder auch diametral entgegengesetzter Auffassungen des gleichen Phänomens ... im alten Israel und in seiner Umwelt" (1972:11). 6 E.g., Keel (1972; 1977a; 1977b; and 1984).
Cf. the Studien zu den Stempelsiegeln aus Palästina/Israel !-IV by Keel et al. (Keel and Schroer, 1985; Keel, Keel-Leu, and Schroer, 1989; Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990; and Keel, 1994). As a more recent example we may take the co-authored work of Keel and Uehlinger, Göttinnen, Götter und Gottessymbole (1992) which incorporates iconographic sources from Syro-Palestine, and tries to integrate them into the religious history (histories?) of Canaan and Israel (cf. the thorough review of the work by Weippert, 1994:1-28). Furthermore, there is an extensive religious history of Israel in preparation, based primarily on the iconographic evidence, authored by Keel and Schroer. Cf. also Keel's exhaustive catalogue of Palestinian stamp seals of which the first two volumes have been published (Keel, 1995; Keel, 1997).

Beschränkung auf Texte entschieden zurück" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992: 10).8 Thus it is attempted to contribute to the reconstruction of the religious conceptual world (Vorstellungswelt) of Israel through pictorial material. 9 The present study tries to adopt an intermediate position in retuming to the exegetical issue, i.e., the God of heaven and warrior metaphors in the book of psalms, but at the same time providing an iconographic comparison which does not focus on illustration and parallels, but on concepts and motifs, i.e., that of the warrior and God of heaven imagery in the depiction of ANE deities. This is attempted through a division between the exegetical and the comparative parts of the study. Only in the following chapter of the discussion will a synthesis between the concept of the warrior and God of heaven as seen from a biblical perspective and from the iconographic perspective be undertaken. Having said that, one immediately has to qualify this statement to the effect that the relationships between biblical imagery and the iconographic material of the ANE are manifold and can be of a rather complex nature (cf. our discussion ofthe comparative method below in chapter 6). 10 These considerations lead to the question of the interpretation of the iconographic evidence and the involved methodology. Although the earlier
8 The methodological procedure to accomplish this objective follows: "Angesichts dieser Situation [the emphasis on texts for the interpretation of the religious history of SyroPalestine] haben wir hier zum ersten Mal ... konsequent einen anderen Weg zu beschreiten versucht. Wir haben mit Hilfe einer systematischen Auswertung des archäologischen Materials unter strenger Beachtung des geographischen Raums und der Zeiträume das Symbolsystem einer Folge von archäologisch unterscheidbaren Perioden zu rekonstruieren versucht" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:457).
9 lt seems to be important to note that iconography cannot be used to reconstruct history, since the nature of ancient art lies in the realm of abstraction and concepts, and not in the depiction of historical events: "ANE iconography is suitable for the illustration of the typical or the institutional, but not for that of the individual person or the historical event" (Keel, 1992a:361). However, it would also be injudicious to deny any relationship between depiction and reality, but not on the level of historiography as a chronology of events, but rather in the realm of religious history or history of ideas. However, in this area, "the visual image is better adapted for the portrayal of complicated relationships" (Keel, l 992a:3 58) than words.
1° Keel (1992a:358) summarizes these relationships: "(]) A biblical text can explicitly describe a work of art, as e.g., the descriptions of Chaldean warriors in Ezek 23:14. (2) Descriptions can also be implicit. There are sound reasons for believing that Ezekiel was influenced by pictorial representations when describing the 4 living creatures supporting the sky (Ezekiel 1 ...). (3) A text and a picture can independently deal with the same subject matter, as e.g., the appointment of an official or his being rewarded (Gen 31 :3745 and several Egyptian tomb paintings ofNew Kingdom date ...)."

attempts of the Fribourg-School11 were less concemed with the methodological procedures applicable in the interpretation of the iconographic sources, usually gearing their methodological considerations toward the demonstration of the benefits iconographic studies have on biblical studies,12 more recent publications touch on methodological issues in a more systematic way (Keel, 1992b; Keel and Uehlinger, 1992). In his introduction to Das Recht der Bilder gesehen zu werden, Keel describes the study as an enterprise in methodology, not from a merely theoretical perspective, but with the aid of three exemplary discussions in which he tries to show the following: (1) Each picture has to be evaluated in its own right without the reception bias of Judeo-Christian exegesis, before it can be linked exegetically to a text. (2) Image and Word are not dichotic, but should rather be complementary to each other, mutually enhancing. (3) Pictures can be interpreted with the help of other pictorial material without necessarily resorting to textual sources (1992b:xi-xiii). While these guidelines are also relevant for this part of the present study, they are rather broad and a more detailed scheme of iconographic interpretation seems to be necessary. 13 Such a method scheme can be adapted for the needs of the present study from Keel's scheme no. 2 (1992b:273). 14
11 Although it may sound somewhat over-significant to speak of a Fribourg-School, it appears that the recent trends in iconography have been clearly influenced by the Swiss scholar and his academic colleagues, while the prolific publishing activities of the OT department at the Biblical Institute at Fribourg have contributed toward this end.
12 Although it appears that the iconographic approach is a predominantly Swiss domain, the dissertation by Beach confirms the increasing attention iconographic studies are receiving in North America. While she positions herself in the tradition of the FribourgSchool she nevertheless takes a critical stand: "While Keel, Winter, and Schroer are prolific in their efforts to relate ancient Near Eastem iconography to biblical conceptions, they are not helpful in explicit methodological self-awareness and explanation. In each case [she examines Keel (1972; 1978), Winter (1983), and Schroer (1987)], one's willingness to accept the textual consequences of their presentation may be moderated by reservations about the contextual handling of the visual evidence (Keel's smaller projects are less open to this weakness)" (1991 :73).
13 Beach summarizes the methodological guidelines for an examination of figurines from Samaria in the following way: (!) location, i.e., the archaeological context ofthe artifact and its significance for the understanding ofthe object; (2) execution; (3) clustering. i.e., the constellation of the various motifs to each other; (4) potency. i.e., potential relationship to Israelite cult, or other potential cult significance; and (5) relation to texts (1991 :92).

Although this scheme appears to present a certain sequential approach to the interpretation ofthe image, it is important to note that these steps do not have to follow consecutively, but are only tabulated like this for presentation purposes. Keel comments: "Das durch dieses Schema suggerierte 1, 2, 3 des Vorgehens ist für uns rein konventionell. Jeder einzelne Aspekt der Wahrnehmung und Reflexion steht in vielfältiger Beziehung mit jedem andern und die Reihenfolge spielt keine Rolle" (1992b:271). However, it is necessary to acknowledge the hierarchical architecture of image composition which is comparable to the hermeneutical circle of exegesis on a linguistic level.18 For this purpose, a certain segmentization has to take place, in order to understand- the substructures ofthe image. 19

Graph 11 shows the interpretation scheme in a more graphic way. The circular depiction demonstrates the reciprocal relationship between the individual components ofthe image. While it is important to understand the smallest units, the overall meaning of the image can only be derived from an integration of all the elements.20 Since the purpose of this study is a
18 l.e., the sequence letter, word, phrase, sentence, unit, section, chapter, book. All the components need to be understood individually, but only their reciprocal relationship creates the overall picture.
19 Tue <langer of this process is described by Keel: "Fragmentation, as initiated by Wilkinson and Layard and followed by many biblical scholars, is still typically the way in which Egyptian and Assyrian pictures are presented in illustrating biblical civilization. Very seldom is an entire relief or a complete wall painting reproduced.... Under such fragmentization the sociological aspect of the pictures is not revealed" (1992a:367-369).
20 In an unpublished M.A. thesis completed at the University of Stellenbosch entitled SyroPalestinian stamp seals from the Persian period (538-332 B.C.). An analysis of their iconographic motifs and inscriptions (1992a), the author has concentrated on a description process for stamp seals which takes this hermeneutical circle of picture interpretation into consideration. Similar to the semantic description for NT Greek by Louw and Nida (1989), a system was developed which divides the image into elements which are classified according to general domains and subdomains (e.g., element domain: figure; subdomain 1: male; subdomain 2: warrior; subdomain 3: god (Reshef); subdomain 4: mixed view). The elements in turn are described according to their · modifications (e.g., modification domain: dress; subdomain 1: short skirt; subdomain 2: striped; subdomain 3: belt). With this descriptive process a systematized approach to the



164 5. Goo AS wARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
presentation of a certain concept, i.e., God of heaven and warrior metaphors, from the perspective of ANE iconography, the emphasis here lies not so much on the pre-iconographic description, but on the iconographic analysis, and on the iconological analysis, i.e., the interpretation of the image.21 This terminology is derived from Panofsky's methodological scheme which has dominated the iconographic interpretation process during the present century. According to him, the iconographic/iconological work consists of three steps: (1) preiconographic description: based on the practical experience of the describer; aimed at the primary object; (2) iconographic analysis: based on the knowledge of literary sources for comparative purposes, focuses on type-history; the secondary or conventional subject is the objective; and (3) iconological analysis/interpretation: based on synthetic intuition and a knowledge of cultural symptoms and symbols; aimed at the establishing of meaning (cf. Klingbeil, 1992a:30).22 Keel has especially criticized Panofsky's second methodological step, since it reverts to an interpretation of images on the basis of textual sources: "Richtig aber ist, dass das Methodenschema Panofskys der Komposition, der Syntax nicht das nötige Gewicht gibt und im Anschluss an die Identifizierung der einzelnen . 'Vokabeln' gleich nach dem zugrundeliegenden (literarischen) Text sucht" (1992b:269). This criticism becomes especially transparent, if one identifies Keel's interest in ANE iconography: "Uns interessiert altorientalische Kunst als Teil der altorientalischen Kulturen und besonders ihrer Religionen" (1992b:271). While we would agree that the importance of interpreting an image in its own right and independently from a textual source cannot be overemphasized, we nevertheless would suggest that the comparison of word and picture remains a sine qua non in ANE iconography, since it constitutes a complementary controlling factor in the interpretation of the picture and the text, and it may serve as a safeguard against a /'art pour l'art approach to iconography.23 Thus it appears tobe
pre-iconographic description and iconographic analysis was accomplished, especially with the view to a possible development of an iconographic computer assisted database.
21 Since we are dealing with a concept which iconographically is expressed through constellations and scenes, the pre-iconographic description has to be regarded as a prerequisite for the present study.
22 This is a rather condensed version of the methodological scheme (cf. Panofsky, 1979:207-225). Fora more intensive critique, cf. Keel (1992b:267-271).
23 In principle, there is nothing wrong with such an approach if one is exclusively concemed with art history (but even there the texts seem tobe indispensable), but ifthe topic is iconography from a biblical perspective, then it seems impossible to remove the image too far from the biblical text. This is, of course, spoken with a certain bias toward the biblical text, yet with the intent to reconcile the two apparent opposites. A different

crucial, not if, but at which point in the interpretative process the comparison between word and image takes place. The image has to be understood in its own right before it can be set in relation to any text. This relationship furthermore should be governed by the principles of a sound comparative method which includes the notion of parallels and/or contrasts.
5.2. THE lCONOGRAPHY OF THE WARRIOR AND
Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST
In the following section, the various images of gods that reflect the concept of the warrior and God of heaven will be presented. lt is important to note that our study is not an attempt to describe the warrior god or God of heaven of the ANE in an exhaustive way, since space and scope do not allow for such a treatment of the iconographic sources. However, we endeavour to provide a representative cross-section of iconographic objects which will demonstrate the attention these themes received during the periods of the ANE.
5.2.1. The Source Material
The selection of the iconographic objects relevant to this study was actuated by an associative approach initiated through the preliminary survey of metaphors in general, and the biblical metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter. Since the God of heaven and warrior metaphors proved to be an interesting and promising imagery with a wide distribution in the book of psalms, iconographic sources which could contribute in any way to the understanding of these metaphors were taken into consideration. The selection was not undertaken within a closed system of referents which would only allow images to be chosen that would correspond closely to or illustrate the biblical text, but rather in a more unconfined associative manner which would be able to provide a representative demonstration of the imagery in ANE iconography. Thus the form of presentation will not draw comparisons at every possible intersection, but first try to introduce the iconographic evidence in its own right in the form of a descriptive catalogue, giving the reader an opportunity to form a 'picture' of these motifs in his/her own mind.24
approach to iconography can be seen in Christian art where the image is clearly intended to illustrate the biblical text (cf. Keel, l 992a:36 l-369).
24 Part ofthe research for this section was undertaken during a visit at the Biblical Institute at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland during February and March _1994. To make



166 5. GOD AS WARRIOR AND AS GOD OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
lt is interesting to note that the majority of images that have any bearing on our discussion, are found on seals and more specifically, on Neo-Assyrian cylinder-seals. This accounts for the fact that the majority of the images presented here are in the form of this iconographic object, confirming Keel's notion that miniature art has been the most important mass communicator in Palestine/Israel,25 although the cylinder-seal is far less common in that region than the stamp-seal.26 However, the character of the cylinder-seal allows for a depiction of complex scenes within a limited space, while the stamp-seal is usually confined to depicting one motif or fragmented scenes. The two governing principles of the comparative method are the criteria of chronology and geography. For the present study we have adopted the following guidelines in the application of these criteria. Chronology: Since we have demonstrated in the exegetical part of the study that the psalms under discussion incorporate material covering a chronological time-frame ranging from the beginning of the Israelite monarchy to the return of the exiles from Babylon, i.e., post-exilic times, we have set the chronological limits for the inclusion of iconographic
this somewhat costly enterprise possible, financial support was given by the Department of ANE Studies at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa, and by the Biblical Institute at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland (from hereafter BIF), for which we would like to express our appreciation. During the stay, the following sources were examined: the stamp-seal collection of the BIF (ca. 8500 pieces); the cylinder-seal collection of the BIF (ca. 500 pieces), the comprehensive collection of ANE cylinderseal catalogues, various excavation reports, exhibition and auction catalogues, ANE art catalogues, as weil as a host of other publications pertaining to ANE iconography.
25 "Entschieden häufiger als all bisher genannten Bildträger hat man in Palästina/Israel aber Siegel und Amulette gefunden. Sie stellten im Bereich der Ikonographie vor der Einführung geprägter Münzen wahrscheinlich das wichtigste Massenkommunikationsmittel dar. Besonders die Siegel sind zudem bedeutend motivreicher als alle andern in diesem Land verfügbaren Bildträger der Bronze- und Eisenzeit" (Keel and Schroer, 1985:20). More recently Keel and Uehlinger went even further in stressing the importance of stamp seals for ANE iconography: "Siegelamulette stellen nicht nur quantitativ alle anderen Bildträgergattungen und erst recht die inschriftlichen Funde weit in den Schatten. Sie können, da sie in allen Perioden relativ gleichmäßig belegt sind, geradezu als eine Art Leitfossil für die Religionsgeschichte dienen, zumal sie aufgrund ihres halböffentlichen Status besonders sensible Seismographen für religionsgeschichtliche Verschiebungen sind..." (1992:11).
26 Cf. the series Studien zu den Stempelsiegeln aus Palästina/Israel (for bibliographical references cf. note 7) in which the development of the stamp-seal in Palestine/Israel is traced throughout the various archaeological periods. lt is somewhat regrettable that the series does not go beyond the end of the Iron Age, neglecting the important yet still obscure Persian period to some extent.

material in this study accordingly, allowing for a certain marginal factor.27 Expressed in archaeological terms, our chronological limits encompass the Iron Age IA (1250-1100 B.C.), the Iron Age 1B (1100-1000 B.C.), Iron Age IIA (1000-900 B.C.), Iron Age IIB (925-720/700 B.C.), Iron Age IIC (720/700-600 B.C.), Iron Age III (600/587-450 B.C.) and Persian period (450-333 B.C.).28 Geography: The geographical limitations of the present study have to be correlated to the chronological demarcations. The period under discussion comprises such a number of historical situations29 and locations that it appears advisable to advance the geographical limitations beyond the immediate Palestinian/Israelite borders. Thus we have chosen images from the ANE in general, while objects from Syro-Palestine receive special attention. This presupposes a certain exchange in the conceptual world of the ancient Near Eastern people which is demonstrable in the wide distribution of the motifs under discussion. One has to mention the fact that quite a number of the iconographic objects selected for this study, have none or an uncertain archaeological context, since they are stemming from museums or have been acquired from antiquity dealers. However, the coherence ofthe motif-history of ANE iconography allows a certain degree of surety in the dating and integration of the respective object. Where possible, the archaeological stratigraphy has been taken into consideration.30 We have applied a similar general classification as in the exegetical part of the study, differentiating between images of deities displaying warrior attributes, followed by depictions ofthe God ofheaven imagery, and finally
27 As observed in our study of Persian stamp seals, motifs of a certain period were often active far into the next period, e.g., the use of Neo-Babylonian motifs up to the end of the 5th century B.C. in Syro-Palestine (cf. Klingbeil, 1992a:57).
28 We follow Keel and Uehlinger in the chronology of archaeological periods which departs from conventional chronologies with regard to the intemal chronology of the Iron Age IIB/C which is based on the finds of miniature art rather than on architectural developments. Their lron Age III (600/587-450 B.C.), however, seems to us too inclusive, since the motifhistory ofthe Persian period definitely also sets new directions in the iconography of Palestine/Israel (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:16-19; cf. Weippert, 1994:3; cf. Klingbeil, 1992a:52-74).
29 E.g., Psa 68 which presupposes a Transjordan locale, possibly, even reaching into Syria. Cf. also the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. While we would not suggests that the texts under considerations originated in these places, the imagery employed in them could nevertheless be attributed to influences from these regions.
3° Comment Keel and Uehlinger: "Die Frage nach dem 'Sitz im Leben' muß nicht nur an die biblischen Texte, sondern ebenso sehr an die bei archäologischen Ausgrabungen gefundenen Inschriften und an die ikonographischen Quellen gestellt werden" (1992:471).



168 5. GODAS WARRIORANDAS GODOFHEAVENIN ANE !CONOGRAPHY
iconographic objects which show deities exhibiting attributes of both classes. The order of presentation within these three general classes is according to motif groups found on the iconographic objects. An arrangement in motif groups seems to be advisable, since it organizes the material in a way that allows the reader to form a structured picture in her/his mind as to how the God of heaven and warrior metaphors were manifest in ANE iconography. Within the motif groups the objects are ordered chronologically.
5.2.2. Gods with Warrior Attributes
The depiction of gods with warrior attributes is attested throughout the various archaeological time periods of the ANE. lt is important to note that an individual god could be portrayed in various poses with differing attributes, while it is as much possible that two different gods were presented in similar fashions with closely resembling attributes.31 Thus the identification of the deity is sometimes ambiguous, especially in view of syncretic tendencies toward the end of the ANE (cf. Klingbeil, 1992b: 117f.).32
5.2.2.1. The Smiting God
The smiting god is one of the most common representations of ANE deities which exhibit warrior attributes. We have limited our selection of objects to ten specimens which indicate the variety and chronological divergence this motifhas undergone in ANE iconography. Our first example of the smiting god (Figure 1) shows a cast bronze figure from the Pomerance Collection, published by Collon (1972:111-134, fig.
31 The iconography ofBa'al and Reshefhas often been confused, since they are depicted in similar stances with only slightly differing attributes. 1. Comelius, from the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa, has examined The iconography of the Canaanite gods Reshef and Ba 'al in the Late Bronze and Iran Age I periods (c 1500-1000 BC) (1994) With regard to the affinities in the depiction of the two Canaanite deities, Comelius maintains: "Only by comparative study ofthe independent iconography ofReshef on the one hand and that of Ba'al on the other, can the confusion in identifying and differentiating between them be cleared. It will be shown that certain attributes, weapons and animal pedestals are unique. These enable us to distinguish between images representing Ba'al, and those representing Reshef' (1994:14). However, after considering the evidence, this notion appears to be somewhat to optimistic.
32 While the region of Palestine/Israel experienced a renewal of orthodoxy in post-exilic times (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:468f.), the ANE as a whole was rather characterized by syncretistic developments, as e.g., the mixed iconographic style of the Phoenician coastal belt during the Persian period shows (Klingbeil, 1992b:110f.; cf Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:434-438).

A).33 The figure is altogether 15.1 cm high, and shows a male in a striding position with bis left foot forward standing on a crouching lion. His right band is raised above bis head, holding an object in an horizontal position, although only the shaft of the object has remained. The left band is extended to the front at the height of his midsection, holding a spear in a vertical position of which the bottom part has been broken off. The ears of the figure are emphasized, and he is wearing a high headdress, reminiscent of the White Crown of Upper Egypt. Since the surface of the bronze figure is corroded to some extent, the dress is
not distinguishable. The lion's mouth Figure 1 is in an open position, and there is a tenon protruding from the bottom-side ofthe animal presumably on which the whole figure was mounted. The way of depiction is typical for this class of figures found throughout the Levant during the Late Bronze and Iron Age 1.34 Thus Collon dates this piece to the 14th century B.C. which would push it to the far end of the chronological margin relevant for the comparative purposes of our study. A definite Egyptian influence is discernible, as the unifying feature of the Egyptian White Crown demonstrates, and the inquiry into the origins for this iconographic motif must be pursued from an Egyptian perspective. With regard to an identification of the figure, Collon correctly observes that, owing to Indo-European influences, the smiting god was connected to the weather- or storm-god in Syria and Anatolia, and that he was identified with various gods throughout the 2nd and 1st millennia.35 The two main possible identifications would be the weather-god Hadad-Ba'al or Reshef
33 Since the figure was acquired privately from a New York dealer, the archaeological context is unfortunately not traceable.
34 Collon presents comparative material from the Levant, Anatolia, Cyprus, Egypt, Spain, and the Greek islands which display a variety in style and techniques, whereas "the only unifying factor is the position they all adopt" (1972: 126). Collon discusses the stylistic differences found in the various provenances. The objects that have been dated, range from 1550-1150 B.C., i.e., the Late Bronze I to the Iron Age IA.
35 "The Smiting- or Weather-god maintained his popularity in Syria and seems to have acquired warrior attributes when necessary" (Collon, 1972: 131 ).

(Collon, 1972:131; cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:67f.), although the final decision is difficult to make, since the weapons held by the figure (which can serve as a distinguishing marker) are partly destroyed. Reshef is normally depicted with a hand-weapon and shield, while Ba'al is often depicted wearing two weapons.36 This would promote the identification of our figure with Ba'al, since the left hand is holding a spear, while the left hand is raised above the head in a smiting posture, holding presumably another weapon, possibly an ax or mace, omitting the possibility that he has been carrying a shield with this hand.37 lt is interesting to note that a typical depiction of the warrior motif is associated with the weather-god. Figure 2 shows another example of the smiting figure motif, communicated through a different iconographic medium, i.e., the scarab. The steatite scarab was found at Beth Pelet (Tell el-Far'ah), grave 935, and stems from the 19th-20th Dynasty which corresponds to a dating between 1295-1075 B.C.38 The Egyptian influence is clearly manifested in the iconographic objects stemming from Beth Pelet (Tell el-Far'ah) (cf. Keel,

Depicted on it is a male figure in a striding position standing on a double line, wearing a short kilt with tassels, and a Blue Crown with an uraeus in the front as a headdress. His right hand is raised above his head, holding a curved sword ready to strike, while the left hand is grasping the hair of an enemy with his head apparently turned away, and his arms hanging down behind his back.39 The presence of the r' and wsr sign could point to a Ramessidian throne name which would identify the male figure with the pharaoh
36 Comelius comments: "The criteria for identifying the figure as Reshef have been the weapons, especially the shield [his italics], which is the only attribute which differentiates him from Ba'al" (1994:131).
37 Comelius excludes the figure from his discussion of bronze figures depicting the smiting god, since the figure is standing on a lion (another indicator for the presence of a depiction of Ba'al) which disqualifies it a priori as a representation of Reshef (1994: 129). 38 The seal was published by Starkey and Harding (1932:pl. 53:227). 39 Cf. a similar depiction ofan enemy in Keel and Uehlinger (1992:136, fig. 144a-b).

Anotber aspect of tbe smiting god motif is found on a steatite scarab from Lacbisb (Tell ed-Duweir), Figure 3, coming from a Late Bronze grave wbicb was reused until tbe Iron Age IIC (720/700-600 B.C.). Stylistically it belongs to tbe 19th-22th. Dynasty (1295900 B.C.).

4° Keel and Uehlinger comment with regard to the presence of this motif in the lron Age IA: "Hingegen ist der über seine Feinde triumphierende und sie dominierende König vielfältig weiter tradiert worden. Mit nur wenigen Belegen ist die klassische Ikone des sogenannten 'Niederschlagens der Feinde' [his italics] vertreten, bei der der Pharao ein Krummschwert über einem niedergesunkenen Feind schwingt" (1992:135f.; cf Keel, 1972:270-276).
41 The seal was published by Tufnell (1953:368, pi. 43/43A, 22; cf. also Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger 1990:314, fig. 91; and Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:86, fig. 87a). 42 Judging the form, it could be the pattemed dress typical for Ba'al-Seth.
43 This headdress is typical ofBa'al-Seth (cf. Eggler, 1992:163, no. 71, 78, and 92). The corpus of seals discussed by Eggler, however, does not depict Ba'al-Seth with warrior attributes, but rather inactive, mostly standing, once on an animal, probably a horse.

grasping the head of a snake with two homs. Behind the back of the figure is a sundisk, and the scene is surrounded by a rope border. The identification of the scene does not present any major problems, and the figure can be readily recognized as Ba'al-Seth,44 the amalgamation of a Semitic and an Egyptian deity.45 Although he is often found in a more passive stance, standing on the back of a horse (cf. note 43), he has warrior attributes and here is depicted as fighting the homed snake representing in Egyptian mythology the Apophis-snake, and the chaos waters in Canaanite myth (cf. Uehlinger, 1990:517). lt is interesting to note that the enemy has been substituted by an animal which nevertheless exemplifies the equivalent threat.46 Taking the Palestinian context of that find into consideration, it appears that the warrior motif of the scarab had a protective function against the destructive foreign elements threatening the region (cf. Eggler, 1992: 163).47 Our next depiction of the warrior motif is represented by a bronze figure from Megiddo (Tell el-Mutesellim) which has been found in stratum VB which can be dated from 1050-1000 B.C. (Figure 4). This close dating and the fact that the find stems from a Palestinian site, enhances the significance of the object for the present study.48 A male figure is standing in a passant position, wearing a short folded kilt with bands across the ehest,
44 "Die beiden Hörner, die statt des Uräus an der Stirn zu sehen sind, das vom Hinterkopf lang herabhängende Band, die Schlange mit zwei Hörnern und die Sonnenscheibe hinter der Figur machen deutlich, dass wir es nicht mit dem König, sondern mit Ba'al-Seth als Schlangenbekämpfer zu tun haben" (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:314).
45 Ba'al was presumably introduced into Egypt during the Hyksos period in the 1?1h century B.C., and by the beginning ofthe Iron Age his characteristic attributes had been merged with those of the Egyptian Seth (cf. Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:202, 308). Cf. also the seal from Tell ed-Dab'a (Avaris) showing the smiting god in the context ofthe snake (Uehlinger, 1990:512-522, fig. 1).
46 "Durch die Verbindung von Ba'al und Seth als Schlangenbekämpfer ist die Schlange, die in Ägypten ein Symbol der Bedrohlichkeit des nächtlichen Dunkels und in Kanaan eines des anstürmenden Meeres war, zu einem Symbol des Bedrohlichen überhaupt geworden, der sie bekämpfende Gott entsprechend zu einem Retter schlechthin ..." (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:86).
47 Cf. the cult stela from Tell Ashara (Terqa) from the time of Tukkulti-Ninurta (888-884 B.C.) which shows the Assyrian weather-god in a smiting posture with an ax fighting the horned snake (Keel, 1972:96, fig. 142).

and a conical crown with feathers on the sides (atef crown?). The features of his face are pronounced. His right hand is raised above his head in a striking position holding a club attached to the front of the headdress. In his left hand he is holding an eight-figure shaped small Hittite shield (Comelius, 1994: 131) which seems, surprisingly, to be facing downwards without a protective function. The whole figure must have been mounted on a platform, since the tangs on the feet are intact. The value of the figure lies in the fact that both weapons are still intact which allows for a closer identification. Especially the shield serves as a marker for the distinction between Ba' al and Reshef.49 Thus we would be confronted with a typical portrayal of Reshef as a warrior stemming from the turn of the 2nd to the 1st millennia B.C.50 Before we retum to miniature art, a final figure representing the warrior motif, a limestone sculpture from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (39.2.215), should be mentioned (Figure 5). Without an ascertained archaeological context, the figure has been dated to the late period, most probably from the 20th-26th Dynasty (1150-600 B.C.). We follow Comelius' description: "lt depicts a bearded god, wearing the white crown, with
the head of a gazelle depicted on it. He is Figure 5
49 Cornelius draws the attention to a bronze found in the Louvre (E 10486 [AF 587]) which is 13,2 cm high, mounted on a pedestal which has an inscription on it reading: dd.n rsp r
m3 't s3t r' dJO) 'nb ~ir s3 ~13pj 'Reshef said to Ma'at, the daughter of Re': I give life to Horns, the son ofHapi.... ' (1994:132). Although the weapon ofthe raised hand is lost, the right hand holds a shield, an arrow and a bow. While the figure can be identified with Reshef, it also bears characteristics of Horns, namely, the face and hairlock, demonstrating the fact that images from the Saite period display syncretistic tendencies.
50 The depiction is typical for the Late Bronze Age depiction of Reshef which raises the question ifthe object can be taken as representative ofthe Iron Age IB stratum in which it has been found or if we are dealing with a relic from the Late Bronze Age. Comment Keel and Uehlinger: "Für die EZ I typisch sind nicht der Waffen schwingende Reschef und der kämpfende Ba'al-Seth, sondern Darstellungen dieser Götter, die sie dominierend auf Tieren stehend zeigen..." (1992:130). A continued usage may, however, be an indicator for a continuous popularity of the motif, whereas it is important to note that an iconographic motif was not terminated suddenly, but rather faded out from popular usage.

dressed in a kilt and stands in a menacing pose, with a small shield in front" (1994:133). lt is not altogether clear, what kind of hand-weapon the figure is holding, since it appears to have been broken off on the left side. The figure is depicted in the typical striding position, while the shield and the head of the gazelle portrayed on the front of the crown leave no doubt as to the identification of the god with Reshef. Thus the depiction of the smiting god during the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age I is associated with Ba' al-Seth and Reshef which are portrayed with almost identical attributes, while the main differentiating factor lies in the usage of the hand-shield for Reshef, viz., the association with an animal. Although Reshef is depicted in warrior fashion, the shield, as a defensive weapon demonstrates his role as protector, especially with regard to sickness and health (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:412). Ba'al-Seth seems to have been connected closer to the weather-god, as other motifs below will show. There is a distinct chronological gap before the smiting god motif reoccurs in the iconography of the ANE. Only toward the latter half of the period under consideration does the smiting god reappear on iconographic objects, except for a silhouette-inlay made from ivory found at Samaria, dating from the 8th century B.C. (Figure 6), which shows a male figure standing in a striding position, wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. With his right hand raised above his head he is holding a club ready to strike, while with his left hand he is grasping the head of an enemy who is kneeling in front of him with his hands raised toward the standing figure.
Figure 6
There is a Lotus flower behind the back of the smiting figure which is an unfamiliar combination, pointing to the Levantine origin of this object (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:298f., fig. 262b). Although the depiction is very similar to the smiting god motif, the figure should be identified with the king in his typical posture (cf. Figure 2), denoting his dominion over the enemies. There are no attributes which would clearly identify him as a deity. Thus the picture is only used for comparative purposes here.51
51 Although the iconography of the object from Samaria is very close to the normal depiction of the smiting god motif. However, the smiting god usually is not portrayed together with an enemy.

Figure 39). Tbe male is in a kneeling position, wearin:g a beard and earrings or side curls, and bis bead is being beld by two other male figures. To the left of tbe nude tbere is a male person witb a long dress, wearing a tall crown. He stands with bis left foot on tbe back of tbe nude figure, wbile bis left band is bolding tbe head of tbe naked figure. His rigbt band points a sbort sword or dagger toward the throat of tbe naked figure. Tbe figure to the rigbt of the naked figure is in a similar position witb bis foot raised onto the tbighs of tbe nude.

To the rigbt of tbe scene tbere is a worsbipper in an adoring gesture facing tbe scene, and above tbere are celestial symbols (seven-star, star, and crescent). Noveck contents: "No gods are represented in tbe contest_ scene, yet a worsbipper points towards tbe scene as if towards a deity or sacred symbols" (1975:57). lt is exactly tbat element plus the divine attributes of tbe attackers wbicb could identify this scene as representing tbe smiting god motif. Tbere is a close parallel to tbe scene, found on a cylinder seal from Assur dating from the 9th to tbe 7th centuries B.C. Only tbe worsbipper bas been replaced by depictions of the 'tree of life' denoting tbe religious connotation of tbe scene.53 A possible identification of tbe smiting god would be Adad (Moortgat, 1940:67f., 141, pi. 73:608).
52 The seal was published by Noveck (1975:57, fig. 41). The dating of the seal has been undertaken from comparison with royal palace paintings and reliefs.
53 lt is interesting to note a possible interpretation of the scene: "lt has been interpreted as illustrating an episode from the Epic of Gilgamesh - the slaying of Humbaba, the monstrous guardian of the cedar forest, by Gilgamesh, the epic hero and legendary king ofUruk, with the help ofhis friend Enkidu" (1975:57).

With the rise of the Neo-Babylonian and Persian empires, new iconographic elements were introduced to the ANE which displayed distinct Western features. Although the motifs are reminiscent of the smiting god imagery and thus constitute a certain renaissance of that motif, the attributes have clearly been transferred to other deities than those representing the motif so far. The next three examples show the smiting god as he appeared in the iconographic evidence dating from the Persian empire. Interestingly, all three specimens stem from the Phoenician coastal line, from 'Atlit, displaying the artwork of the Phoenician seal-cutters which often merged various tradition into the local Phoenician style. Especially the Western Greek influence is detectable. Figure 8 shows a scarab from 'Atlit found in tomb L 21 which was dated from 500-352 B.C., whereas the object dating would set the limits for this object from 450-332 B.C. The scarab is made from carnelian and the base measures 16 mm in height and 12 mm in breadth.54 The style has been

classified by Galling as archaic-Greek (1941 :155), and the scarab bears an inscription incised into the spaces in between the various elements along the
border of the scene, reading •nill 'Awitam' which was most probably the name of the seal-owner. 55 The scarab portrays a male figure in a passant position facing toward the left. He appears to be naked, but a lion-skin indicated by the lion-paws hanging from his shoulder, is discernible. He is wearing a pointed beard, and a hat as a headdress. The right hand is raised in the familiar gesture above his head, holding a club. The left hand56 is extended toward the front holding a bow. Thus two different warrior
54 The original publication is Johns (1933:75, fig. 41); cf. also Galling (1941:155, 189, pi. 8: 110a). The seals from 'Atlit are housed in the Rockefeller Museum, Jerusalem.
55 The name is Phoenician, but the reading may not be correct: "In its present form, the name is unknown among the Semitic onomastica, which would lead to the question, if
the reading is correct, or if we have indeed a new name in front of us. There is an 1n1.!' found in the Palmyrene inscriptions, meaning 'helper', whereas the final nun is a suffix.... The Arabic 'atä 'to be proud, go beyond bounds' seems also possible..." (Klingbeil, 1992a:80). 56 Since the depiction is aspective, it is difficult to determine the right or left arm.



5. GODAS WARRIORANDAS GODOFHEAVENINANE ICONOGRAPHY 177
motifs are combined here.57 While the overall figure appears to be clearly influenced by Greek iconographic motifs, the head of the figure seems to betray its Phoenician origin. Figure 9 adds some interesting features to the motif of Heracles as the smiting god. lt is a scarab of green jasper, found in tomb L 20 at 'Atlit, dated 450-332 B.C. (cf. above). The seal base measures 14 x 10 mm and is surrounded by a rope border which is typical for Phoenician craftsmanship.58 Depicted on the seal there is a naked male figure standing in a striding position facing to the left. He is wearing a lion-skin around his shoulders of which the front-paws are crosswise folded over his ehest, while the tail is hanging down behind his back. The head of the lion is probably, in typical fashion, covering the head of the male figure, although this is not determinable with certainty. The figure features a pointed beard. With his left hand he is holding the club raised above his head, whereas the club ends in three round objects. His right hand is grasping the right hind leg of a lion which is facing downwards along the seal border, though with its head twisted upwards. Behind the male figure, there is dog in a running position vertically inserted along the right border of the image, apparently filling a gap in the design of the scenery. The dog seems to be somewhat disconnected from the action that is taking place in the image. The lion-skin and the club readily identify the figure as Heracles with the added 'Herr der Tiere' or lion-conqueror motif. Another additional element, the dog behind Heracles, demonstrates once more the Phoenician tendency to combine different iconographic traditions and merge them into a new one, whereas these combinations where not only motivated artistically, but reflect the religious syncretism prevalent in Phoenicia during that period. Culican correlates the dog to the 'dog of Ba'al' an iconographic tradition going back to the 2nd millennium B.C. (1969:88), which would point to an iconographic identification of Heracles with the Phoenician god Melqart, the Ba' al of Sidon which is substantiated by Figure 9
57 Comments Galling: "Der Bildtypus ist eine Kombination von 'Herakles mit dem Bogen' und 'Herakles mit der Keule', zwei aus der archaisch-griechischen Glyptik bekannten . Motiven" (1941 :155). 58 The original publication is Johns (1933:70f., fig. 30).

the stance of the figure. 59 While it is not possible to trace the line of development with certainty, the connection to the Canaanite Reshef as a predecessor of Heracles seems more than likely.60 Our final example of the smiting god motif (Figure 10) also comes from 'Atlit (tomb L 20), and follows the two preceding specimens to a large extent. lt is found on a scarab made from green jasper, measuring 16 x 12,5 x 9 mm, also dated to 450-332 B.C. (Johns, 1933:71, fig. 31 ). lt shows a naked figure61 in a kneeling or running position. The object behind his back could be a lion-skin or a quiver. His left hand is raised above his head holding a similar club as in Figure 9, and the right hand is clenching a bow. The whole scene is surrounded by a rope border. While the depiction of Heracles holding two weapons is in tune with other representations (e.g., Figure 8), the position of the god varies somewhat from the normal striding stance. lt is possible to think that the position of the figure is due to the limited space on the scarab, but from comparison with numismatic material from the Persian period which shows the Persian king in the same position, it can be seen that we have an allusion to the popular Persian iconographic motif of the hunting king. Thus we would be confronted with a certain degree of identification between Heracles and the Persian king made by his Phoenician subjects (cf. Klingbeil, 1992b:109f.).
5.2.2.2. Archer Scenes
The following group of iconographic objects will include depictions of gods using the bow and arrow. One has to differentiate between active and passive archer scenes, i.e., scenes in which the bow is actively used as a weapon pointing an arrow against an enemy, and scenes in which the bow
59 "If one considers the posture and action of Herakles on the seals, the affinity to the representation of the Phoenician god Melqart, the Ba'al of Sidon, becomes rather apparent, while Herakles apparently was the Greek adaptation of that Phoenician deity. This is confirmed by a bilingual inscription found in Malta" (Klingbeil, 1992b:109, cf. also Smith, 1962: 176-183).
60 Since there is a chronological gap in the Iron Age II for the depiction of Reshef as the smiting god, one needs to establish the 'missing link'. 61 In this depiction the male parts are clearly visible.



5. GODAS WARRIORANDASGODOFHEAVENIN ANE ICONOGRAPHY 179
is only carried as armory.62 According to our classification system, Figure 11 only indirectly pertains to the archer scenes motif group, since it depicts the god in the blessing position, while the archer can clearly be identified as the pharaoh. However, since the shooting of the arrows is the cei:itral imagery in this scene, we have included this cylinder-seal among the archer scenes. The seal stems from Beth-Shean (Beisan) and has been dated from the Late Bronze Age to the beginning of the Iron Age I.63 The style is clearly Egyptian and depicts the pharaoh shooting at a target. He is wearing the Blue Crown with an uraeus attached to the front, and a cartouche above his head reading wsr-ma'at Ra' identifies him as Ramses II (1301-1254 B.C.). Below the target there are two bound Asiatic prisoners who are the actual aim of the shooting practice. The god on the left of the target is extending a curved sword toward the pharaoh. He is wearing a short kilt and the White Crown with streamers attached to it, holding the ankh sign in his other hand. Protruding from the forehead or crown there is the head of a capride, perhaps a gazelle. These features would identify the god with Reshef presenting the Asiatic prisoners to the pharaoh as a symbol of the pharaoh's dominion over his Canaanite provinces.64 While the scene does not depict a god in an archer scene, it nevertheless indirectly demonstrates the approval of the warrior god for this activity, and indicates his
involvement in the imagery.65 Figure 11
62 The bow will also occur in other motif groups, while the differentiating criteria for the inclusion in this group is the exclusiveness ofthe bow as a weapon. Images in which the bow is only carried as part ofthe armory are described elsewhere. Furthermore, the bow both in active and passive scenes will also appear in the group of objects representing a mixed form with warrior and God ofheaven attributes.
63 The seal was originally published by Rowe (1930:31, pi. 34:4); cf. also Parker (1949:no. 30) and Keel and Uehlinger (1992:100-102, fig. 113).
64 This becomes apparent if one takes into consideration that the seal stems from Beth Shean. Comment Keel and Uehlinger: "Er [Reshef] würde dann auf unserem Rollsiegel als Stadtgott von Bet-Shean dem Pharao Ramses II. den Sieg präsentieren" (1992:102).

Figure 12 shows an archer scene which depicts a deity shooting at a Mischwesen. The motif is found on a cylinder seal with unknown provenance from the Marcopoli Collection. lt 1s made from serpentine and measures 41 mm in height and 11 mm in diameter. The style is Neo-Assyrian and it has been dated from 900-800 B.C.66 The scene portrays a male archer facing to the left holding a bow which is drawn to füll extent. There are wings attached to the back of the figure. He is aiming at a Mischwesen, a scorpion man with wings and bird's feet (cf. Figure 13: a cylinder seal impression from Nimrod on which the same Mischwesen are shown in the 'Herr der Tiere' motif). Above the scene there are celestial symbols (star and crescent), and there is a rhombe67 at the bottom behind the back of the Mischwesen. The depiction is typical of the Neo-Assyrian hunting scenes which constitute a large amount of the iconographic motifs found on mmiature art from Assyria.68 Normally the huntsman is identified with the Neo-Assyrian king, but in this instance the wings add a mythological dimension to the picture. Mythologizations like that are known from the Neo-Assyrian Figure 13 period, and they are applied to both
curved sword toward the pharaoh has to be understood as a pledge of victory (cf. Keel, 1972:pl. 21-22). 66 The original publication is Teissier (1984:150, fig. 144).
67 The meaning of the rhombe in ANE iconography is not altogether clear but seems to have been used as a apotropaic symbol. Comments Uehlinger: "Auch der Rhombus ist als Symbol nicht einer bestimmten Gottheit zugeordnet, sondern signalisiert die sich im Kult eröffnende Heiligkeit der himmlischen Sphäre bzw. den von ihr ausgehenden Schutz" (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:328).
68 The motifs represented on the seals stemming from Assyria during the Neo-Assyrian period, are different from the subjects portrayed on reliefs and other monumental art. Comments Collon with regard to the corpus of seals from Nimrud: "The two main subjects are the perennial hunting and banquet scenes. The huntsman is always an archer and he can be kneeling ..., standing ..., or shooting from a chariot ... at his prey which is generally a bull, sometimes a winged bull or a sphinx" (1987:75).

animals and human figures. An identification of the god in the archer position is difficult to undertake, but a possible candidate would be Ninurta, the patron deity of war and hunting, but the weather god Adad would also qualify for such a scene, as a cylinder seal from Gezer shows (see below Figure 15).
Our next sample (Figure 14) shows a more passive archer scene, and is located on a cylinder seal from Megiddo (found in the water system in square P-5), measuring 29 x 12 mm. Archaeologically it has been dated from 900-600 B.C. which corresponds roughly to its style, i.e., NeoAssyrian. 69 The scene depicts a male figure of which only the outline is distinguishable. He has his one leg lifted in a stepping position, resting on the back of a small griffin70 which is facing away from the figure. The man is wearing a long beard, but no headdress is visible. He is holding a staff behind his back on which the Venus star with eight rays is mounted.71 With his other hand, the man is extending a bow72 toward a big winged griffin which is raised onto his hind legs in an attacking position. There is a seven-star above the griffin and again a rhombe between the two main protagonists. lt appears that we are again confronted with a mythologized hunting season. The male figure cannot be identified as a god without hesitancy, but the whole image has a cosmic and mythological dimension, expressed by the celestial symbols and the Mischwesen. Furthermore, the depiction is not along the lines of a standard hunting scene, but the bow is only used passively in a protective gesture, and no real combat is taking place. lt is interesting to note that the Mischwesen represent a threat to the cosmic order and are negatively identified. Comment Figure 14
69 The seal was originally published by Lamon (1935:pl. 8:6); cf. also Keel and Uehlinger (1992:329-331, fig. 282c).
70 The griffin and other winged Mischwesen were a popular motif in Palestine during the Iron Age 11B, influenced by Egyptian iconography. They were associated with solar categories often epitomizing the highest solar god (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:244, 251).
71 lt is not altogether clear, if staff and star are connected to each other. The staff may be a weapon, and the star a celestial symbol without necessarily being linked together.
72 We have identified the object as a bow, since the bow does not always have tobe held in an active shooting position.

Keel and Uehlinger: "Kämpferische Auseinander-setzungen spielen sich auf den Zylindersiegeln haupsächlich im mythischen Bereich ab und dienen der Sicherung kosmischer Ordnungen. Die Protagonisten sind dementsprechend Mischwesen, Helden, Genien und Gottheiten" (1992:330).73 Along the same lines we find a series of fayence cylinder seals depicting the archer scene in a particular way. Figure 15 shows a fayence74 cylinder seal from Gezer dated 750-700 B.C.75 The style is Neo-Assyrian and the material used for the seal fabrication identifies it as a massware product. lt shows an anthropomorphic depiction of a god with wings pointing upwards and possibly also another pair of wings pointing downwards. The head is unfortunately indistinguishable and the headdress as a possible identifier, cannot be determined. He is wearing a lang pattemed dress. The god is holding a bow in a shooting position toward a homed snake. The object protruding backwards from the snake's neck may be an arrow which has
(

pierced the animal already. The snake is coiled together in an upward perspective. In between the god and the snake there is an unidentified object which may be a distorted depiction of a rhombe (cf. Collon, 1987:84, no. 388; Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:47, fig. 53). The more likely interpretation of that object, however, would be the
73 lt is interesting to note Lamon's original interpretation of the scene: "The impression would appear to represent the cosmological myth of the struggle between Bel (Marduk) and the dragon, especially in the form in which it is found in the apocryphal portion of the Book ofDaniel (Bel and the Dragon, verse 27): 'Then Daniel took pitch and fat and hair and boiled them together; and he made lumps and put them into the dragon's mouth, and the dragon ate thereof and burst asunder.' The object which the bearded god is forcing upon the dragon cannot be a bow, in view of its form and the manner in which it is held; it is probably the bolus of fat, pitch, and hair" (1935:pl. 8:6 [description]). This interpretation reflects the tendency to use iconographic images as illustrating ANE texts, viz., of reading ANE texts into iconographic images. There is, however, a substantial time gap between this image and the apocryphal book Bel and the Dragon which is usually dated to the 3rd or 2nd centuries B.C. (cf. Moore, 1992:26f.).
74 "Das Stück ist zwar nur unzulänglich ohne Materialangabe publiziert, dürfte aber aus Fritte sein und aus einer assyrischen oder nordsyrischen Massenproduktionsstätte stammen, deren Produkte im 7. Jh. in alle Teile des Weltreiches gelangten..." (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:331 ).
75 The seal was originally published by Macalister (1912:347, no. 42). We could only establish the height ofthe object, i.e., 29 mm.

depiction of the horned dragon on which the war-god Ninurta is standing, and which is a second representation of the god himself.76 The scene would thus represent the struggle between Ninurta and Anzu, or in more general terms, the weather/war-god against the chaotic forces. The horned snak:e would thus be a Canaanite adaptation of the Anzu-dragon representing the chaotic forces. The arrows used by Ninurta would represent lightning used as a weapon by the war god.77 As a final example of the archer motif, a cylinder seal from Susa will be presented (Figure 16). Although there are no further archaeological notes, the approximate dating is from the 8th to the 7th centuries B.C. The style is somewhat different from the typical Neo-Assyrian depiction and can be identified as Elamite betraying the place of origin for the seal. lt measures 20 mm in height and 8 mm in diameter and was originally published by Amiet (1972:282, no. 2190, pi. 188:2190). The seal shows a hunting scene with two Mischwesen. The Mischwesen to the left has a fish body, bird legs, wings and a human upper body which seems to be turned backwards in a shooting position. The human head features a beard and wears a low cap as a headdress. The Mischwesen to the right consists of a winged capride body with a long upwardly curved tail in a jumping posture. The upper body is also human and in a similar position as the other creature, while the headdress is a high tiara usually associated with the king. Below the Mischwesen to the right there is a dog in a standing position with its head slightly bend downwards. lt almost appears as if the Mischwesen would be jumping over the dog. The interesting element of the scene is the fact that both Mischwesen are aiming with their bows in the same Figure 16
76 The Anzu-myth describes this metamorphosis of Ninurta: "Die Göttin Mab, seine Mutter, sagt zu ihm: 'Hänge den Bogen um, die Pfeile mögen Gift hintragen. Wie beim bösen Drachen soll sich dein Aussehen verändern'. Ninurta verwandelt sich in einen Drachen und speit Blitze. Diese Aussage ist frappierend, besagt sie doch, daß der gehörnte Drache, auf dem Ninurta fast immer abgebildet wird, er selbst ist, in seiner zweiten Erscheinungsform..." (Moortgat-Correns, 1988:126).
77 Keel and Uehlinger identify the god on the cylinder seal with Adad, proposing that both Ninurta and Adad were "Individuationen des Wettergottes, die in Assyrien geradezu als Zwillingsgötter gegolten haben" (1992:331). Moortgat-Correns shows, however, that Adad had a messenger function in the mythological struggle between Ninurta and Anzu (1988:127).

direction. Although the lower animal bodies of the two creatures seem to be in juxtaposition, the upper bodies are facing the same direction pointing their arrows toward an imaginary enemy, since there is no indication of any aim for their shooting attempts. In similar scenes, there is usually an identifiable object against which the arrows are directed.78 Hence, the immediate threat is removed, and the archer motif has become to some extent self-sufficient. This seal shows the universal popularity of the archer scene during the Iron Age IIB/C with its Mesopotamian variation.79 Tue dog below the Miscfiwesen to the right seems somewhat disconnected from the scene, and similar observations with regard to its meaning can be made as for Figure 9.
5.2.2.3. The Godwith the Spear
Another typical depiction of ANE iconography is the god with the spear fighting the forces of chaos represented by the snake. We have selected three specimens which illustrate the motif. Interestingly all of them can be dated to the early part ofthe time period under consideration for this study. Figure 17 shows a graffiti from Tell Lachish which is dated to the Late

He is (possibly) wearing a beard and a conical crown as a head dress to which streamers are attached. lt appears that the figure has slung a bow around his waste, although
78 Cf. a similar scene on a cylinder seal with unknown provenance from the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, which shows a Mischwesen with a human upper body holding a bow. He is wearing an angular, high, feathery headdress which is Babylonian and can be associated with the depiction of deities, but is also wom by the king. The arrows are directed against a griffin which is in flight (Collon, 1987:81, fig. 364).
79 Wilkinson demonstrates the mythological connotations of archer scenes in Egyptian iconography (1994:184f., fig. 133-134).
80 The graffiti was published by Ussishkin (1978:18); cf. also Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger (1990:309-321, fig. 96); Keel and Uehlinger (1992:86f., fig. 86); and Comelius (1994:162, BR18). The object was found in area P, level VI, locus 31612 in a room leading to the side entrance of the main hall in the temple. The location is not central, but the scene depicts a popular motif.



5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 185
such a depiction lacks parallels.81 The god has raised both arms above his head holding a javelin with a broad blade. The spear seems to be somewhat out of proportion and is pointed slightly downwards as if to be thrust at an imaginary enemy. The identification ofthe scene does not present any major questions and we are confronted with the motif of Ba'al-Seth fighting the homed snake, similar to the depiction found in Figure 3, only with a different weapon. One can summarize with Keel and Uehlinger:
Die aus dem ägypto-kanaanäischen Tempel auf dem Tell stammende Ritzzeichnung eines Gottes, der mit beiden Händen eine mächtige Lanze über seinem Kopf hält ..., ist als Kombination des kanaanäischen Ba'al, der die Meeresschlange (Litanu/Leviatan) bekämpft, mit dem ägyptischen Seth, der die Apophisschlange überwindet, zu verstehen... (1992:84).82
The interesting fact that the snake is not visible, leaves open the question if the motif had been traditionalized in such a way that the complete depiction was no longer necessary.83 A more complete portrayal, i.e., including the serpent, is found on our next sample The scene in Figure 18 is on a scarab of unknown provenance housed in the Musees Royaux, Brussels (E 7036b). lt is made from steatite and measures 20,4 x 15,2 x 8,8 mm. Stylistically it has been assigned to the Ramessidian dynasties which corresponds to the period of 1300-1150 B.C. (Late Bronze Age IIB).84 Depicted on it there is a winged figure wearing a short kilt with tassels. Although the body is anthropomorphic, the top part depicts the head of the Seth animal with long ears and
a protruding snout.85 The figure has a pair Figure 18
81 One has, of course, to keep in mind the sketchy character of a graffiti in which details are neglected.
82 Keel has earlier on identified the god with Reshef (Keel and Schroer, 1985: 17), but has abandoned that interpretation, and designates the scene now as depicting Ba'al-Seth (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:318).
83 Taking into consideration that the object was found in Canaan (Palestine) raises the question as to what extent Ba'al-Seth was worshipped in Palestine at the end of the BronzeAge.
84 The seal was published in: Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger (1990:310-312, fig. 84). There is an inscription reading mrj d!Jwtj 'beloved of Thot'.
85 The Seth-animal is not easily associated with any real animal, and seems to be similar to the griffin (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:233, n. 305).

of wings attached to its back which are typical of Ba' al and Seth and their combination during the Late Bronze Age.86 With his one hand raised above his head, he is holding a lang lance or javelin thrusting it down into a homed snake which he is grasping with the other hand. The tail of the snake is curved upwards behind the god.87 Although the depiction is clearly Egyptian in style and the streamers that often betray the EgyptianCanaanite combination of Ba' al-Seth are missing, the figure should be identified with this god, as comparative material clearly indicates: Figure 19 shows a steatite scarab from a private collection dating to about 1500-1300 B.C. lt depicts Ba'al-Seth in a completely anthropomorphic way besides the characteristic wings wearing the White Crown with the long-eared Seth-animal attached to the front of it, and streamers at the back (cf. Comelius, 1994:215). He can be seen thrusting a spear downwards into the
Figure 20
body of a snake. Our last example of the god with the spear motif is a bas-relief found on the basalt stela from Rugm el-'Abd (Transjordan) discovered in 1851 (Figure 20).88 The stela unfortunately has been broken off at the base, rendering the image incomplete from below the thighs of the central figure of the scene. The stela has been dated between the 9th and 8th centuries B.C., since the skirt and other iconographic details find parallels in Phoenician art of the 8th/7th centuries B.C. (Warmenbol, 1983:67-70). The image depicts a male figure in a standing position with his head tumed toward the right.89 He is wearing a striped
86 "Es lässt sich leicht eine Reihe von Siegelamuletten zusammenstellen, die den engen Zusammenhang, wenn nicht die Identität zwischen Seth und Ba'al, dem geflügelten Seth und dem geflügelten Ba'al ... demonstriert" (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:304f., fig. 69-76).
87 "Eine gehörnte, den Kosmos bedrohend Schlange findet sich in Vorderasien spätestens seit der Kassitenzeit..." (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger: 1990:310).

short kilt, and a cap fitting tightly around his head without covering the ears. The cap is pointed toward the back and ends in a long streamer which is vertically pointing downwards ending in an upward curl, while the curl has been interpreted as representing a sundisk and a crescent. The 'warrior' is holding a spear with both hands with the left hand raised above his head clutching the end of the spear. The spear has a broad blade and is pointed downwards as if the figure is ready to thrust the weapon into an object below, although his face is not tumed toward the imaginary enemy. To the left side of the figure, there is an animal in an upright position of which the bottom part has been broken off. The animal is mostly interpreted as a lion, although the upright position is somewhat unusual.90 The style of the stela reveals Egyptian influences. While there was no physical Egyptian presence in Moab during that period, the style was imported via the Phoenician coastal cities which proved to be overly accepting of Egyptian and other foreign iconographic influences. The image has been interpreted as either representing a warrior or a divinity, whereas the decisive factor evolves around the presence of the sundisk and crescent which would be indicators for the depiction of a deity. Warmenbol identifies the scene as a portrayal of Kemos, the national Moabite god, adducing Ugaritic texts (Kemos = km.J): "II s'agit d'incantations devant proteger le recitant contre les morsures de serpent" (Warmenbol, 1983:74). However, if one considers the posture, the streamer, and our preceding illustrations, it becomes clear that the Moabite stela is following in the tradition of Ba' al-Seth the serpent slayer (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:320). Perhaps we are confronted with the Moabite adaptation of the god with a possible change of designation. The motif of the god with the spear has revolved around the depiction of the serpent slayer Ba'al-Seth in the form of a combination of Egyptian and Asiatic iconographic characteristics which predominantly took place during the end of the Late Bronze and the Iron Age I, although the stela from Moab illustrates the continuance of that iconographic motif, possibly by way of reintroduction to the Levant via the Phoenician iconographic workshops. Concludes Keel: Die Identifizierung der beiden Gestalten [Ba'al and Seth] in der SB IIB und EZ I hat durch eine gewisse Loslösung vom Natursubstrat zu einer eindrücklichen und kämpferischen Göttergestalt geführt, die in grundsätzlicher Weise energisch im
90 Against that interpretation: "II faut y reconnaitre un rapace et non un lion. II subsiste des traces du bec et de l'aile normalement vsible; l'oiseau regarde aussi vers la droite..." (1983:67). Although Warmenbol derives his observations from the study ofthe original object, it is difficult to identify a bird of prey on the stela. Especially the flat snout would indicate the portrayal of a feline.

5.2.2.4. The God/dess in Arms
This motif group will concentrate on images depicting gods with warrior attributes which will be identified by the arsenal of weapons they are wearing. In most of the cases the scenes are passive portrayals of the warrior motif, i.e., the gods are merely carrying the weapons without actively using them in contrast to the smiting god motif.91 Interestingly, all depictions stem from Neo-Assyrian cylinder seals dating from the 9th to 7th centuries B.C. An intricate and clear depiction of the motif can be seen on a photograph from a cylinder seal impression of which the present location is not known (Figure 21).92 According to comparative material the image could be dated to the late 9th and early 8th century B.C., since the cult of Ninurta was at its peak during that period.93 The image depicts a god standing on a horned dragon between two high standards. The bearded god is facing toward the left and is wearing the feathery horned crown of Assyrian deities. He is clothed in a knee-long skirt and is wearing a long rohe over it which 1s intricately ornamented with hexagons. He is carrying an array of weapons: an ax in his left hand, Figure 21 two quivers and bows crosswise
91 Depictions of gods in armor with added weather-god attributes (e.g., sun-rays or waterstreams) will be discussed below. lt appears that this classification is somewhat artificial, since the affinity between warrior and god of heaven attributes is very close. Our differentiation has to take place on the phenomenological level, and not on the interpretative, since often a figure displaying exclusively warrior attributes can be identified with a weather-god, viz., Ba'al.
92 The photograph was part of Prof. A. Moortgat's estate, and has been published by U. Moortgat-Correns (1988:123-130, fig. 5a-b). The measurements are not clear, but ifthe photograph has been taken 1: 1 than the seal would have been 45 mm in height.
93 After comparing the various iconographic details (dress, weapons, priest), MoortgatCorrens comes to the conclusion: "Nimmt man alles zusammen und bedenkt, daß der Kult Ninurtas sicher seinen Höhepunkt im 9. Jh. gehabt hat - das geht auch aus den Texten von Assurnasirpal II. bis Samsi-Adad V. deutlich hervor -, so dürfte eine Datierung unseres Siegels in die Zeit von Samsi-Adad V. oder Adad-nirari III., d. h. in das letzte Viertel des 9. Jh., das meiste für sich haben und am wahrscheinlichsten sein" (1988:130).

over his shoulders behind his back, another ax on his back, and two sickle swords attached to his belt and a quiver.94 All around the figure small stars are depicted, marking him and his weapons as divine. His right hand is raised. The animal on which the god is standing is a Mischwesen incorporating body parts of various animals. From its mouth comes forth a weapon in the form of a triple forked lightning. The two standards are ending in an oval plaque on which two gods are depicted: one is running on a winged dragon which emanates the forked lightning, and he is holding a sickle sword with his one hand. The other god is in an identical stance on a quadruped (a bull?), pointing a bow. Facing the god there is a priest who is raising both hands in adoring gestures toward the god. He is wearing a high cap which is pointed toward the top. Behind his back there is a female goddess standing on a pedestal. She is also wearing a bow and quiver behind her back, holding a corona of pearls in her hand. We largely follow Moortgat-Correns' identification of the scene which shows the Assyrian god Ninurta standing on his animal which functions as a depiction of himself in another form (cf. our remarks to Figure 15). The gods in the standards95 represent the image of Ninurta (again in twofold form) in his stance of fighting the Anzu serpent, while the other god may be his messenger god Adad with the bow. The goddess can be readily identified with Ishtar, since the way of depiction is typical for her portrayal on Neo-Assyrian cylinder seals. Moortgat-Correns concludes: "Ich sehe also in der Darstellung Ninurtas auf seinem siegreichen Drachen die Wiedergabe seines Kultbildes, so wie es im 9. Jh. zur Zeit Samsi-Adad V./Adad-niraris III. in seinem Tempel zu Nimrud ... gestanden hat..." (1988:130).96
94 We cannot detect the long sword mentioned by Moortgat-Correns (1988:124).
95 "Es handelt sich bei den beiden Standarten zweifellos um Feldzeichen, die die Assyrer auf ihren Kriegszügen mit sich führten und die, aufgepflanzt auf den Streitwagen, den Truppen voranzogen" (Moortgat-Correns, 1988:127).
96 There is a legend on the seal which has not been reproduced in the line drawing of the original photograph. Following Kessler, it reads: "... des Assur-sumu-iddina, des Priesters des Ninurta, ... des Adad, die den Kriegszug durchführen. Ninurta (und) Adad von Kalhu [his italics]" (apud Moortgat-Correns, 1988:134). One has to mention that
philologically it is not clear, ifNinurta (dMAS = line 5) or Nergal (dMAS.MAS = line 3) is meant, or the second MAS in line 3 has a different meaning (cf. Kessler apud Moortgat-Correns, 1988:134). lt is interesting to note that there is a certain correlation between the legend and the depiction which is not a common feature of ANE iconography.

Our next example (Figure 22) of the armed god motif shows a cylinder seal from Natanya. lt is a surface find in the Neo-Assyrian style and can be dated to the 9th to 8th centuries B.C.97 lt has an inscription reading 'Bel-asaredu, palace official'. The scene consists of two worshippers who are standing behind each other in a gesture of adoration before a god. Both are wearing long dresses and no headdress,98 and have raised their arms in the typical Assyrian adoration gesture with one hand in a fist with the thumb pointing forwards, while the other hand is opened in a grasping gesture. The god is standing on a bull, the characteristic animal of the weather god Adad. He is armed with a bow and quiver on his back, a sword at his side, and a club in his hand. The other hand is raised in an open gesture receiving the adoration of the worshippers. He is wearing a beard and a high headdress ending in a globe which could be the stylized version of the feathery crown. Above the scene there is a crescent and a seven-star. The animal and posture indicate without question that we are confronted with a cult image of the weather god Adad receiving adoration from two worshippers/priests.

discernible. He is extending one hand toward the worshipper. There is an eight-pointed star above his horned headdress and one above bow and quiver respectively. In front of him a bareheaded worshipper is kneeling with his face turned away from the god and his hands raised in adoration. Next to him another worshipper is depicted with the typical Assyrian gestures of adoration. This figure is in a standing position and turned toward the male deity. Above the two worshippers there is a winged sundisk and a crescent. Behind the worshipper a female deity is depicted in like fashion as the male god standing also on a pedestal turned toward him. 100 She only seems to be armed with a long sword, and possibly with a quiver and a bow. She is holding a corona of pearls in her hand, while the other hand is extended in like fashion toward the male god. 101 Behind the goddess there is a horned quadruped in a crouching position seemingly suspended in midair. The scene is concluded by a musoussu dragon (cf. Seidl, 1989: 187-193) on whose back the marru spade102 rests in a vertical position.103 The dragon is similar to the one on which Ninurta is standing in Figure 21. There are celestial symbols (crescent, seven-star, eight-pointed star, rhombe) interspersed between the various figures. The scene portrays a worship scene of the warrior gods lshtar and Ninurta. We would suggest that the scene on the cylinder seal has not been divided correctly, since the dragon positioned behind the male god, forms the left border of the scene. Although the dragon has the symbol of Marduk on its back, it appears more likely that it can be identified as the characteristic animal of Ninurta who is, however, not standing on his symbol animal, but next to it. Both Assyrian deities are often depicted together. 104lnteresting are the differing postures of the two worshippers - one standing and one kneeling: the kneeling position is rarely found on similar scenes. Our next sample is found on a cylinder seal with unknown provenance, housed in the Staatliche Münzsammlung München (Figure 24). lt measures 25 x 13 mm and is made from a milky coloured stone not nearer identified. lt belongs to a group of seals, "deren Darstellung (Beter vor verschiedenen Gottheiten) vornehmlich mit dem Kugelbohrer herausgearbeitet wird.

100 Moortgat-Correns comments on the pedestal: "Das Podest, auf dem sie [Ishtar] steht, gibt zu erkennen, daß es sich um ihr Standbild handelt" (1988:127). 101 Taking stance and gesture into consideration, both gods almost form a mirror image. 102 Vollenweider incorrectly identifies the object with the "lance de Marduk" (1967:69). 103 These objects are symbols ofthe Babylonian god Marduk (cf. Klingbeil, 1992b:103).
104 "Ischtar scheint Ninurta nahe zu stehen: sie sind auf einer Anzahl Siegel gemeinsam abgebildet, beide sind Kriegsgottheiten und ihrer beider Tempel in Nimrud befinden sich in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft..." (Moortgat-Correns, 1988: 127).

106 lt is questionable if the marru spade was already identified with Marduk during the 9th/8th centuries B.C. as it was the case during the Neo-Babylonian and at the beginning of the Persian periods. The spade may be an indicator that the seal originated in the Babylonian sphere of influence during Neo-Assyrian times.

be dated around 800 B.C.107 The scene shows two bearded gods in almost identical position and gesture. They are wearing the high square crown which ends in a knob, probably a reduced schematic depiction of the homed feathery crown with the star on top. The gods are wearing a lang rohe of which the bottom part is striped and held tog~ther by a broad belt. They are armed with a bow and quiver crosswise on the back, although the depiction is very schematic and the individual weapons are not easily differentiated.108 lt follows that the depiction of the bow and quiver has been traditionalized to such an extent that it could serve its purpose even through a very sketchy depiction. There is a sword attached to the belt pointing backwards from the figures. The right arm is raised in a greeting position, while the other hand is holding the staff of a mace or club which is in a vertical position.109 The weapon is comparable to the club held by Adad in Figure 22. In front of the two gods, a bareheaded (?) and bearded worshipper is standing, having his hands raised in the adoration gestures familiar by now. The worshipper is dressed in like manner as the two warrior gods. The objects behind the gods can be readily identified as a crescent and below that the qan tuppi stylus ofNabil resting vertically on a pedestal.110 The gods on the seal are difficult to identify, since their depiction is schematically reduced, and no definite attributes of certain gods are associated with the two gods. Candidates for an identification of the two warrior gods would be Ninurta and his messenger god Adad, although the presence ofthe symbol ofNabil is difficult to interpret, since it can hardly symbolize both gods. 111 A Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal in the British Museum shows the warrior motif in another variation (Figure 26). lt is a gamet seal, measuring 43 x
107 Tue seal was originally published by Ravn (1960:l l 7f., no. 150). Cf. his dated parallels.
108 Comments Ravn: "They [bow and quiver], therefore, seem reduced to decorative elements, cf. the rays and circles of rays frequently occurring in this Assyrian group, although they probably do originate in the picture ofa bow..." (1960:117).
109 Tue hand holding the weapon of the second figure is not clearly distinguishable. Tue weapon is comparable to the mace-staff on the stela of Esarhaddon (680-669 B.C.) from Zinjirli (Keel, 1972:281, fig. 407).
11° Cf. also the similar depictions of the symbol of the moon deity Sin of Haran which is a standard with the crescent above, although crescent and standard would be to far apart here (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:339f.). For the identification of the divine symbols for Marduk and Nabu, cf. Seid! (1989:121-125).
111 Although the cult ofNabu was widely spread during the l't millennium B.C., the god · was rarely associated with the warrior imagery, but with leaming and writing as the scribe ofthe divine council (cf. Dalglish, 1992:1054-1056).

18 mm, and can be dated to the 8th and 7th centuries B.C.112 On it .,. a female goddess is standing on a lion or leopard113 which she is holding on a leash. She is wearing the Assyrian homed feathery crown with the eight-pointed star above, and is dressed in a kneelong skirt and a long pattemed Figure 26 rohe. She is portrayed in füll arms, whereas the details of the weapons are intricately modeled. On her back she has slung two quivers crosswise over her shoulder, and a sickle sword is hanging from the one quiver. Onto her belt a long sword is attached ending in a star. She is holding a bow and two arrows in her one hand, while the other hand is raised in a greeting gesture. Facing her, a female worshipper in a long pattemed dress is standing with the familiar adoring gestures. The worshipper seems to have a sword or other staff-like weapon attached to her belt.114 Behind the worshipper two homed caprides are raised on their hindlegs, intertwined with each other. The scene is completed by a palm tree, and an object which looks like an earring above the animals but which could be interpreted as a winged sundisk. 115 The image depicts Ishtar on the lion (as a cult image) fully armed worshipped by a female adorant. The palm tree and the intertwined caprides with emphasized phalli clearly illustrate the scene's connotation offertility.116
112 lt was published by Ward (1910:fig. 751; cf. also Weber, 1920:no. 222; Collon, 1987:166f., pi. 26:773; Winter, 1983:459, fig. 504; etc.).
113 The attribute animal oflshtar is a lion, although the dots on the animals body could also point to a leopard or a panther (cf. Collon, 1987:167). Even if one has to expect the lion as Ishtar's attribute animal, the iconographic description should not be guided by preconceived knowledge.
114 Here the difference between divine arms and ordinary arms becomes apparent: there is no star attached to the end ofthe weapon.
115 For the earring, cf. Oppenheim (1943:192, pi. 3). After checking the original, and with Mayer-Opificius we would rather suggest that we are confronted with a schematic depiction ofthe winged sundisk with tail (1984:222, no. 6).
116 The palm tree in connection with caprides is a familiar iconographic motif since the Middle and Late Bronze Age, and was there associated with the "gebärfähige und nährende Segensmacht der fruchtbaren Erde" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:80; cf. also l 72f.). Although this connotation experienced various changes it retained its basic closeness to the fertility cult which may be substantiated by the fact that we are dealing with a female worshipper.

Our final example (Figure 27) of the armed god motif is found on a quartz cylinder seal with unknown provenance which has been stylistically dated between 800700 B.C. 111 Although the seal is not worked in such detail as the
preceding sample, it nevertheless Figure 27 presents an interesting variation to the god in arms motif. Starting from the left of the scene, there is an armed bearded god standing on a homed dragon, possibly wearing a high headdress.118 The quivers over his shoulders are schematically depicted with the stars above them as mere globes. He is holding a bow in one hand, and a sword is attached to his belt. The space toward the next figure, an adorant, is filled with an eight-pointed star, a rhombe, and a bull's head. Between the adorant and the seated god there is a table which could be interpreted as an offering table. The bearded god is seated on a throne with a high back. He has a sword attached to his belt, and is holding a mace-scepter119 with his one hand, while the other hand is raised holding an ax over the offering table. Behind the god there is a musbussu with the marru spade and the qan tuppi stylus on its back, symbolizing the Babylonian deities Marduk and Nabü. Above there is a winged sundisk. Although the scene is not unfamiliar, and the armed god fits well into this motif group, the depiction of the other god holding an ax above the table as a possible sacrifice scene is less familiar. 120 Besides the symbols of Marduk and Nabü, an identification of the gods is not easily undertaken, since the depiction is schematic. As for Figure 24 and Figure 25, the depiction is characteristic for Ninurta or Adad, while the seated god cannot be identified further. The gods with warrior attributes have been represented by four motif groups: (1) the smiting god, (2) the god in archer scenes, (3) the god with the spear, and (4) the god in arms. lt is interesting to note that the active warrior scenes, i.e., images on which the god is actively involved in warrior activities like smiting, shooting, thrusting, are largely limited to the end of
117 The seal is described rather broadly as stemming from Mesopotamia, and has been auctioned by Sotheby's (1992:fig. 211). 118 The seal is unfortunately chipped in this place. 119 Cf. note 109.
120 One could, of course, question if the seated figure indeed represents a god, or rather the king. However, the clearly higher headdress and the adorant in front of him would indicate the presence ofa deity.

the Late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, except for the renaissance of the motif in the smiting Hercules during the end of the time period under consideration for this study. The passive warrior scenes, i.e., the god in arms motif, have been limited to the Neo-Assyrian period, while only one sample came from the Syro-Palestinian region. 121 The predominant iconographic medium for the passive warrior scenes is the cylinder seal, while the active warrior scenes were found on various image carriers.
5.2.3. Gods with God of Heaven Attributes
This second class of iconographic objects will include images displaying attributes which can be associated with the god of heaven metaphor. Again, it has to be stressed, that the selection is phenomenologically motivated, and does not endeavour to examine a certain type of ANE deity, as e.g., just the weather-god. The rather broad terminology 'god of heaven' has been chosen purposefully in order to accommodate various gods who display characteristics that fit the criteria. Thus the images will include depictions of weather- and storm-gods, probably foremost, but also gods connected to other cosmic and celestial phenomena, such as sun, moon, stars, water, wind, creative power, seraphim, etc.
5.2.3.1. The God in the Winged Sundisk
This motif group will contain depictions of the winged sundisk, whereas we have concentrated on anthropomorphic portrayals of that imagery, i.e., the god within the sundisk. Mayer-Opificius has examined the development of the winged sundisk in Mesopotamia and Syria from Old Assyrian times onward. The motif is of Egyptian origin and one of the most dominant iconographic images throughout ANE iconography. She summarizes with regard to the beginning of the anthropomorphic .depiction of that motif "Nach anfänglicher stärkerer Betonung ihres 'himmlischen Aspekts' wird zu Beginn der neuassyrischen Zeit anscheinend mehr Gewicht auf die Epiphanie des Sonnengottes gelegt" (1984:207). The chronological margin of the selected objects presented here confirms this assertion.
121 And even there only in connection with the Assyrian administration centers: "Das erneute Auftauchen von Rollsiegeln [during the lron Age IIC] hängt also direkt mit der Präsenz assyrischer Beamter in den palästinischen Provinzen zusammen" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:328). As Keel has repeatedly mentioned, the cataloging of SyroPalestinian cylinder seals remains a desideratum (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:328, n. 292).

Figure 28 clearly shows the transformation of the sundisk motif into the epiphanous depiction of the sun-god. The scene is found on a Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal with unknown provenance dated in the 9th
century B.C. which falls in the Figure 28 middle of the Neo-Assyrian empire. 122 The seal is made from serpentine measuring 18 x 9 mm and is housed in the Pierpont Morgan Library. 123 Depicted on it there is a nimbus in the centre of the scene. The sun-rays are clearly discernible, although there are no wings attached to it. 124 The god in the nimbus seems tobe armed with a sword and possibly a bow, although the details are not altogether distinguishable. He is completely anthropomorphic, wearing a lang patterned dress, although it is thinkable that his lower body is depicted as a tail, since the feet are not discernible. The nimbus is flanked by two worshippers in a gesture of adoration. They are similarly dressed as the god in the nimbus. The scene is concluded by a stylized tree and an eight-pointed star above it. There is a crescent between the adorant (to the left) and the nimbus. Although the god is depicted with weapons, we would identify him with the sun-god Samas and not with the god Asshur.125 The worshippers could also be supporting the nimbus, but their gesture is the familiar one of adoration. The depiction in Figure 29 is found on a decorated horse trapping from Urartu (Eastern Anatolia)126 dated to the 8th century B.C. 127 lt measures 21
122 "Aufgrund der Forschung der letzten Jahrzehnte ist man übereingekommen, den Beginn der neu-assyrischen Zeit mit Tiglatpilesar I. anzusetzen" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:198), who reigned from 1114-1076 B.C. 123 Published by Porada (1948:82, no. 685).
124 Although the sundisk has no wings attached to it, we have included it under the current motif group, since the rays take over the function of the wings, symbolizing the rays of the sun.
125 "Die Anthropomorphisierung der Sonne in der frühen neuassyrischen Zeit - vor allem die Darstellung der Flügelsonne mit dem 'bewaffneten' Gott - hat in der Wissenschaft häufig zu seiner Deutung als Assur geführt. Der 'kriegerische' Charakter dieses Gottes gilt ja allgemein als besonders typisch für ihn. Wie W. Mayer [Untersuchungen assyrischer Militärgeschichte] demnächst ausführen wird, dürfte diese Vorstellung falsch sein. Daß Assur wegen Kriege geführt wurden, muß keinesfalls bedeuten, daß er eine 'kriegerische Gottheit' war" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:200).
126 The object is housed in the Tel Aviv Museum and has been published by Merhav (1987:no. 74).
127 Merhav suggests: "In trying to date this piece, it should be pointed out that the chain of triangles (or zigzag) which here forms part of the design, decorates helmets, quivers and

cm in height and is made of bronze. The plaque is highly decorated with a variety of motifs128 of which we have chosen the central ring depicting the god in the winged sundisk. Along the border there are chains of buds, triangles, and zigzag decorations. The god is depicted with his upper body emerging from the disk. He is bearded and wears a helmet-like pointed cap which ends in a globe. His right arm is raised in a blessing gesture, while his left arm is extended forward. The wings of the sundisk are horizontally attached, and the feathers are clearly distinguishable in the form of curved lines. The tail is conically shaped and is also decorated with a feather design, though not as obvious as the wings. The interesting aspect about this depiction is the two streams of water which are emanating from the sundisk diagonally downwards. Comments Mayer-Opificius: "Wichtiger noch als die neue Darstellung der Flügelsonne [i.e., with a feathery bird's tail below] - für das assyrische Gebiet zwar ein Datierungsfaktor - ist es jedoch, daß der bereits in der Mitanni-Zeit erfundene Bildgedanke des aus der Sonne strömenden Regens wieder aufgegriffen wird" (1984:198f.).129 The streams ofwater symbolize fertility and purification. Since the object comes from Eastem Anatolia, it is interesting to note the universal popularity and uniformity of that motif during the Neo-Assyrian period. An interesting variation ofthe theme is found on ajasper cylinder seal from the British Museum.13° lt has been dated to the 8th- 7th centuries B.C. and displays Neo-Babylonian influences (Figure 30).131 The scene on the seal depicts the king sitting on a throne with a back rest. His dress is highly

128 The other scene shows a representation of the 'Herr der Tiere' motif: a hero is holding two bulls on their homs.
129 Similar images will concern us below under the water-providing god motif group (5.2.3.2.]. Although they will also be in association with the sundisk, the central topic of these motifs will be the water and not the sundisk. 130 Published by Wiseman (1958a:fig. 81).
131 Dress and headdress of the king, and the presence of the marru spade point toward a Neo-Babylonian origin for this cylinder seal.

omamented and there is a sword attached to his belt. His beard and hairdress is intricately modeled, and he is wearing a pointed cap with three spikes pointing upwards. In his hand he holds a drinking bowl, probably a libation bowl, since there is an offering table standing in front of him (cf. Figure 27). Behind the king an attendant is standing holding a fan toward the
,IImiiii
Figure 30
king. On the other side of the offering table another attendant is standing, waving an object over the table toward the king. 132 The interesting part of the image is seen along the border of the upper section of the scene: there is an eight-pointed star on the right, followed by the marru spade, the symbol of the Babylonian god Marduk, and a crescent. Above the offering table a sundisk is depicted out of which the upper body of the sun-god emerges. He is facing toward the left with his hands raised, probably holding the ring and the rod. Below the sundisk there is a bird's tail. The sundisk does not have wings and is omamented with eight curved lines, possibly symbolizing the water sources connected elsewhere with the sundisk, although Mayer-Opificius proposes that this aspect of the winged sundisk did not penetrate significantly into Babylonian iconography (1984:206). lt is interesting to observe that the anthropomorphization of the sun-god has developed so far as to omit the wings of the sundisk altogether. Next to the sun-god there is a priest dressed in the fish-dress, holding a bucket and offering a palm fruit, viz., pine cone. Mayer-Opificius comments on the distribution of the anthropomorphic sun-god motif in Babylon: "Auch der anthropomorph in der Sonnenscheibe erscheinende Gott ist deutlich eine im Norden beheimatete und in Babylonien nur selten übernommene Darstellungsform des Sonnengottes. Auf einem Siegelbild [Figure 30] tritt der Sonnengott am Himmel in menschlicher Gestalt mit einem Vogelschwanz, der unterhalb der ungeflügelten Sonnenscheibe sichtbar wird..." (1984:206).
132 The object has been interpreted by Wiseman as a fly swatter, but the context of the image could indicate a ritual performance.

Figure 31
Figure 31 shows another, though less evolved, variant of the anthropomorphization of the sun-god, and is found on a stamp seal from Gezer, reflecting the presence of the motif in the Syro-Palestinian region. The conoid is made from carnelian, measuring 22,7 x 15 x 23 mm, and has been found in grave 4 dating to the Persian period (5th century B.C.). However, the Neo-Assyrian iconography of the image would identify the seal as belonging to the Iron Age IIC (720-600 B.C.).133 The seal shows an adoration scene: on the right side a worshipper or priest is standing with his hands raised in adoration. He is wearing a round cap and an Assyrian-type dress (cf. the similar patterned dress ofthe worshippers in Figure 22 which has been dated to the 9th to 8th centuries B.C.). In front of the worshipper there is a winged Mischwesen with a falcon head, possibly a griffin (Black and Green, 1992:99f.), above which a crescent has been inserted.134 Both figures are standing on a double standing line which has been broken off below the Mischwesen, facing each other. The sundisk is positioned above the scene, consisting of a double nimbus and horizontally extended wings. A spreadout feathery tail has been added below the sundisk. The most interesting feature of the sundisk is, however, the two arms that are extended downwards from the wings, ending in three-fingered hands. Since this motif is relatively rare in Neo-Assyrian depictions of the winged sundisk motif, it may be a misunderstood or purposeful adaptation of the streams of water motif normally found on the Assyrian variations of the theme.
133 The seal has originally been published by Macalister (1912:293, fig. 154:14b); for the dating, cf. also Keel and Uehlinger (1992:337f., fig. 293a).
134 These falcon-headed winged Mischwesen were especially popular during the Iron Age IIB (925-720/700 B.C.). Keel and Uehlinger comment on their meaning in SyroPalestinian iconography: "Die geflügelten Mischwesen .. . sind trotz der Doppelkrone bzw. der Sonnenscheibe, die sie in der Regel auf dem Kopf tragen, kaum als Verkörperungen irgendwelcher Gottheiten zu sehen. Das Attribut auf dem Kopf verleiht ihnen aber königlichen bzw. solaren Charakter. Die Mischwesen sind deshalb wohl als Wächter und Schutzmächte im Dienste eines in solaren Kategorien vorgestellten 'Höchsten Gottes' und 'Himmelsherrn' zu verstehen. Ihre Präsenz auf Privatsiegeln dürfte eine gewisse Individualisierung und 'Demokratisierung' der damit verbundenen Ideen bedeuten" (1992:289f., fig. 249-254b). The connection to the solar deity becomes explicit with the association ofthe Mischwesen with the winged sundisk on our seal. Cf. also the rising sun on a scarab from Tell el Far'ah (Tirza) dated 1650-1550 which shows a rising sun above a winged Mischwesen, possibly a griffin (Cornelius, 1990:30, fig. 13).



5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 201
However, the solar deity, the Assyrian Samas, received a certain popularity in Syro-Palestine during the 8th century B.C., although solar-oriented images were on the decline (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:337f.). There is a cylinder seal in the collection of the Biblical Institute, Fribourg (from hereafter 'BIF') which shows a further development of the winged sundisk motif (Figure 32). The seal measures 36,7 x 15,5 mm, and in accordance with its modeled style it has been dated to about 700 B.C. (Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:45, fig. 50). The winged sundisk has fully developed into an anthropomorphic figure who is standing on the back of a horse. The horse has been associated with Samas (Schroer, 1987:288; Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:45), and thus the god is clearly identified as the Assyrian solar deity. The nimbus is not discernible anymore, but the feathery tail is clearly represented by the wide dress covering the upper body, worn by the god over his long patterned skirt. The god has raised his hands and is depicted facing to the right side. From the horizontally positioned wings two streams of water are flowing diagonally downwards. On top of the left wing a human head is visible, while the equivalent head on the right wing is not visible, since the seal has been chipped off in this place.135 To the left of the wings there is an eightpointed star, while on the right a crescent may be distinguishable. Below the wings there is a straight line which seems to serve as a platform which is carried by two bull-men. 136 The scene is flanked by two figures, a priest (genius?) in a fish-dress on the left with his right hand raised, holding a bucket with his other
hand,137 and an adorant with no Figure 32
135 The interpretation of these heads is not clear. Schroer mentions the following possibilities found in the relevant literature: (1) symbolizing the heavenly god; (2) depicting the Uranian Trias, whereas the wings would represent the sky and not the sun; and (3) individuals received and protected by the sun (1987:289, n. 154).
136 The presence of the bull-men may serve as an indicator for the place of origin of the cylinder seal: "Auffallend ist das Fehlen der Stiermenschen in dem hier behandelten Kreis. Diese Mischwesen sind anscheinend nur in südlich-babylonischer oder hethitischer(!) Ikonographie dem Sonnengott zugeordnet" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:198).
137 Comment Black and Green on the significance ofthe bucket and cone gesture: "Written sources on the matter are few, but it seems clear that the bucket and cone were associated with purification, for they are known respectively as banduddil (bucket) and, significantly, mullilu (purifier), and figurines of genies holding these attributes were



202 5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
further specific details. Since Samas is standing on a pedestal on the back of the horse, we may be confronted with a cult image of the deity. The entity of the platform supported by the two bull-men communicates a certain type of world-view, i.e., that the heavens are supported by certain semi-divine beings, the atlants, and that the heavenly realm consists of more than the sun-god, i.e., rain and other heavenly symbols and figures, although it centers around the depiction of Samas. Furthermore, the god serves as a transitional figure between heaven and earth, since he breaks through the platform and is supported by his attribute animal. 138 Our next example may serve as an indicator for the anthropomorphization of the winged sundisk (Figure 33). The scene is found on a stamp seal, measuring 17 x 12 mm of which the provenance is somewhat unclear.139 The seal has been incised on both sides, while on the reverse side there is an inscription reading 1'?01, ntli~ nomo'? 'belonging to mn}J,mt wife of gdmlk' which will concem us below (Figure 34). The image presented on the side shown here depicts two bearded worshippers who are wearing long Assyrian-type dresses. They have raised their hands in a gesture of Figure 33 adoration toward the winged sundisk. 140 In
among the types placed within buildings for protection from malevolent demons and disease..." (1992:46).
138 Comments Schroer on the meaning of the scene: "P. Calmeyer and U. Seid! [1993] haben inzwischen aufgezeigt, dass urartäische Bilder des Mannes in der Flügelsonne, der von Berggottheiten beidseitig gestützt wird, im Rahmen von Siegesdarstellungen beheimatet sind und wahrscheinlich den Sonnengott in seiner Funktion als Siegesgarant versinnbildlichen" (1987:299f.). This interpretation of the sun-god would establish a link to the warrior motif.
139 The seal has supposedly been found by a missionary during the last century. lt is now housed in the British Museum (BM 136202). Galling has published it with his inscribed name seals from Syria and Palestine (1941:151, 184, no. 82; cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:338, n. 300). Note Galling's description and interpretation of the scene: "Wir sehen hier einen Ring mit Vogelschwanz und Flügeln, zwischen denen der Oberkörper des Gottes sichtbar wird. Dieser assyrische Typus findet sich ähnlich auch bei der Darstellung Ahuramazdas, und man kann daher ... fragen, ob das Siegel nicht in die persische Periode gehört" (1941 :151 ).
140 As a matter of fact they may be supporting the sundisk, a function which would identify them as semi-deities (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:338). The supporting figures are found from the 2nd millennium B.C. and come in a number of variations: "Schließlich wären noch einfach menschlich gebildete 'Helden' geflügelt oder ungeflügelt, mit oder ohne Hömerkrone, zu nennen, die in allen Gebieten und Zeiten als Atlanten fungierten .... Ihre



5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 203
between the adorant there is a crescent and a star. The sundisk has two horizontal broad wings, and a feathery tail of sunrays. Out of the nimbus of the disk the upper body of a bearded god is emerging. He is facing toward the left, extending his arms in a gesture of blessing. As to the identification of the scene, Keel and
Uehlinger observe: Figure 34
Assyrische Darstellungen dieser Gestalt hat man früher gerne mit Assur, urartäische mit ijaldi, achämenidische mit Ahuramazda, d.h. mit dem jeweiligen obersten Staatsgott identifiziert. Diese Identifikation des Gottes in der Flügelsonne ist aber mit guten Gründen in Frage gestellt worden. Der in der assyrischen und achämenidischen Monumentalkunst stets mit dem König verbundene Gott ist doch eher als Sonnengottheit zu verstehen... (1992:338).
Thus we are confronted with a representation of Samas the Assyrian sungod. Keel continues to identify the god on our seal with the Edomite Gad, since the onomasticon gdmlk displays this theophoric element, although the reading of the name is not unambiguous. 141 Palaeographically the seal can be dated to the 7th and early 6th centuries B.C. displaying Edomite features (cf. Figure 34).
Another seal housed in the BIF shows the later development of the god in the winged sundisk motif (Figure 35). lt is a carnelian cylinder seal with unknown provenance, measuring 28,3 mm in height and 13,1 mm in diameter, and although the image is in the Neo-Assyrian tradition, it shows Achaemenid features, and can thus be dated around 500 B.C. (Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:pl. 4).142 The scene shows the upper body of a bearded god in a sundisk, whereas the nimbus is not distinguishable. The god is exhibiting Achaemenid
influences, since he is wearing the Figure 35
Rolle als reinigende Genien wird in neuassyrischer Zeit deutlich" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:198).
141 However, Lemaire reads 7'?01!:l instead of 7'?01l which is attested among the Moabite onomastica, although he opts for an Edomite palaeographic interpretation of the inscription, since the ::, at the end of line 2 is uncommon in Moabite palaeography (Lemaire, 1992: 16). Note the stylized ankh sign at the end ofthe first line.
142 The seal was originally published by Vollenweider, Bruschweiler, and Stucky (1966:157, no. 43, pi. 95e).

Persian kidaris crown with five points which normally was reserved for the Persian king. 143 Another departure from traditional Neo-Assyrian portrayals of the motif is the addition of two extra wings which are pointing diagonally upwards. There is also an indication of the water streams flowing from the wings. Below the sun-god, two winged bulls are standing in a position typical for the supporters of the heavenly realm, the atlants, discussed in connection with Figure 32. In between the winged bulls a nimbus144 is depicted in which the ehest of a similar figure as the god above in between the four wings is portrayed. Both figures are facing to the right with their hands raised in a gesture of blessing, and are wearing the Persian kidaris. One would normally expect an object like a sacred tree, but scarcely a repetition of the god. "Die Büste im Kreis stellt wahrscheinlich den irdischen Stellvertreter des himmlischen Königs dar" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:pl. 4). Thus we would be confronted with a close identification of king and sun-god with an allusion to the, in Achaemenid times popular, motif of the 'Herr der Tiere'. lt also seems possible to identify the figure below as a second representation of the sun-god (cf. Figure 21). Above surrounded by wings, symbolizing the heaven, below in a nimbus taking the place of the sacred tree. However, taking the nature of Achaemenid royal iconography into consideration, it seems more likely to interpret the figures as sun-god and king in close association. As a final example of the god in the winged sundisk motif, Figure 36 may be taken. lt is found on a golden metal plaque from Sardes and can be dated to the 5th century B.C. lt measures 22 x 20 mm and is intricately worked.145 The object shows a bearded god with a flat cap. He has four feathery wings. The upwardly curved tips of the wings are characteristic of Achaemenid iconography (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:433, fig. 360a-361b). Below there Figure 36 is a tail which in the form is almost
143 Cf. the seal from Tell Keisan with the typical Achaemenid 'Herr der Tiere' motif on which the Persian king is depicted fighting a horned bull or griffin (Keel, Shuval, and Uehlinger, 1990:231f.; cf. also Klingbeil, 1992b:106).
144 Whether the object is just a 'ring' like a frame, or a nimbus reminiscent of the sundisk, is difficult to determine.
145 Tue gold plaque was originally published by Boehmer and Güterbock (1987:114, fig. 90).

identical to the four wings. Tue sundisk has disappeared completely, although there might be a remnant of it below the figure in the form of a half circle. lt stands to question if this depiction was still identified with the sun-god, or if it designated the heavenly god Ahuramazda without specific solar connotations. Again we note the affinity in the depiction ofthe god to the royal iconography of the Persian period. The development of the god with the winged sundisk has proceeded throughout the ANE146 in terms of an increasing anthropomorphization of the god, whereas other heavenly attributes became more and more important, causing the original exclusively solar oriented iconography to shift - in instances even to disappear147 - toward a heavenly deity closely associated with Achaemenid royal iconography, although one comes fullcircle here, since the original Egyptian motif was associated with the pharaoh (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:294f.).148
5.2.3.2. The Water-Providing God
This motif group will include images where the iconographic emphasis is placed upon the water-providing god, although at times the motifs are disconnected from an anthropomorphic depiction of the water providing god. Most of the images are in contexts with the winged sundisk,149 but it appeared advisable to assemble them into a separate motif group, since the focus is somewhat different and does not lie primarily on the solar connotation. The scene presented in Figure 37 is found on a lapis lazuli cylinder seal from the Thebes hoard (Greece).150 The seal measures 41,8 x 15 mm and displays Kassite style. Although the archaeological dating is out of context, the seal bears the inscription of its owner reading "Kirdin-Marduk, son of Sha-ilimma-damqa, the 'sha-reshi' official of Burnaburiash, king of the world [his italics]" (Collon, 1990:34). The Kassite king Bumaburiash
146 "Man darf es deshalb zu den überzeitlichen altorientalischen Motiven rechnen" (MayerOpificius, 1984:190). 147 Referring e.g., to the omission ofthe sundisk as found herein Figure 36.
148 This is, of course, a generalization, since the motif experienced geographical and chronological developments which favoured individual iconographic elements, while other attributes never came to fruition in other areas.
149 We have already encountered the streams of water emanating from the sundisk (cf. Figure 29 and Figure 32).
150 The hoard "was found in 1963 in Greece in a Mycenaean level. lt contained gold, agate and lapis lazuli objects including thirty-six lapis lazuli cylinder seals. Many of the seals were either of Cypriote origin or had been re-cut in Cyprus. Others came from Babylonia..." (Collon, 1990:34f.).

reigned from 1359-1333 B.C. which would locate this seal in the marginal zone of the time period under question for this study. The impression of the seal shows a bearded god facing to the left. He is wearing a flat cap, and the ornamentation on his long skirt is Figure 37 reminiscent of flowing water. He is positioned between two mountains on which flowers and trees are growing. The god has extended his arms to the sides and he is holding a vase in each hand from which streams of waters flow down into vases on the ground. Taking the Middle Babylonian origin into consideration, the god has been identified as the water god Ea, while the scene depicts rain falling from heaven and the resulting fertility of the earth. Interestingly, there is no association of the rain with the winged sundisk or other common celestial symbols whatsoever. Comments Mayer-Opificius: "Himmelsdarstellungen bisher üblicher Art, symbolisiert durch den Halbmond oder die 'SonneMond' -Kombination, findet man in mittelbabylonischer Zeit ebensowenig wie die Darstellung der Flügelsonne" (1984:203). The seal shows that the world-view, viz., the view of celestial phenomena, differed significantly within the ANE, since in Babylonia the mountain- or water-god was responsible for the rainfall, 151 and not the winged sundisk as in northern Mesopotamia and Syria.152 Geographical factors like topography or climate might have contributed to these differences. An interesting constellation of the winged sundisk alongside the streams of water can be seen in Figure 38. lt stems from a chalcedony cylinder seal of unknown provenance, housed in the British Museum, measuring 26,5 x 15
151 Although the name of the seal-owner incorporates the theophoric element Marduk we would nevertheless follow Mayer-Opificius in her identification of the god as Ea, since from a methodological perspective, inscription and image should not be parallel (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:390). With regard to Figure 37 Mayer-Opificius comments: "In mesopotamischer Tradition stehen dagegen die verhältnismäßig oft auftretenden Bergund Quellgötter mit wassersprudelnden Aryballoi. Eine vermutlich im kassitischen Heimatgebiet verehrte Gottheit dürfte hier mit dem Süßwasserquellgott Ea in Verbindung gebracht worden sein, d.h. vermutlich zu seinen 'Trabanten' gezählt worden sein" (1984:204; cf. n. 84 for the identification ofthe god as Ea over against Marduk).
152 And Syro-Palestine to some extent (cf. the specimen ofthe winged sundisk motif group from Syro-Palestine).

mm. 153 The style is Neo-Assyrian and it can be dated to the 9th century B.C. (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:206). The center of the scene is taken by a winged sundisk with feathered wings. The sundisk is supported by a kneeling male figure. The figure is wearing a striped cap and a pattemed lang skirt, while no further attributes helpful in the identification of the Figure 38 figure can be detected.154 On the left and right sides of the winged sundisk two vases are pouring streams of water down into vases on the bottom of the scene. There are two winged male figures to the right and left borders of the image facing toward the center, holding a bucket in one hand, while the other hand could be presenting the palm fruit, viz., the cone. An inscription seems to have been subsequently added reading '(belonging) to Nabu-nasir, son of Amel-resh-Adad'. Since the inscription does not seem tobe original, the theophoric elements contained in it cannot be adduced for the interpretation of the scene. The interesting part about the image which shows the natural phenomena of sun and rainfall in the context of a worship scene, is that the streams of water are depicted alongside the sundisk, while there is no immediate link between the two, except for their celestial position.155 The whole image is not associated with an anthropomorphically portrayed god as in Figure 37.
153 The cylinder seal was presumably found in lraq and published by Wiseman (1958:pl. 69; cf. also Collon, 1987:183, pi. 29:866; Brentjes, 1983:156).
154 The figure supporting the winged sundisk appears to reflect Assyrian influence, while it takes the place of the sacred tree, the scorpion-man, or other mythical figures. "Aber auch andere göttliche Wesen, die zu dem Kreis um Ea und Adad gehören, können als Himmelsträger auftreten" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984: 198).
155 Mayer-Opificius observes with regard to the seal: "Daß der im Norden nun häufig auftretende Bildgedanke der regenspendenden Flügelsonne in Babylonien niemals heimisch geworden ist, kann man an einem neubabylonischen Siegel des 9. Jahrhunderts erkennen [Figure 38] .... Das assyrische Vorbild ist nach babylonischen Vorstellungen umgeformt worden: Aryballoi, die n e b e n den Flügeln der Sonne abgebildet sind, fungieren als Wasserspender" (1984:206).

Figure 39
While on former depictions of the water motif, the rain was coming down from the celestial realm, in Figure 39 it is flowing from vases positioned on the ground. The scene is found on a camelian cylinder seal with unknown provenance, measuring 22 x 10 mm. The style is Neo-Assyrian and the seal can thus be dated to the 9th and 8th centuries B.C.156 The scene is flanked by two priests/worshippers wearing the fish dress,157 holding the bucket and offering the palm fruit, although they could also support the sundisk, since there is no object discemible in their raised hands. In the centre a bearded male figure is standing, supporting the winged sundisk above. His head is portrayed unproportionally big and he is wearing earrings or curls and a long pattemed dress. He is depicted in similar fashion as the male in Figure 7 on which he is found in a completely different context, i.e., the smiting god motif. Comments Mayer-Opificius concerning his identification: Erst im zweiten Jahrtausend tritt in der mittelassyrischen Glyptik der sechslockige Held - La.lJmu - als Atlant auf. Die Verbindung zur Flügelsonne wird in diesen Falle vielleicht durch seine Zugehörigkeit zu Ea zu erklären sein. Ea wird im babylonischen Raum nicht nur mit Süßwasserquellen, sondern auch mit Regen in Zusammenhang gebracht.... Wie bereits behandelt, ist seit mitannischer Zeit Flügelsonne und Regen eine verständliche Kombination - auf diese Weise könnte man den sechslockigen Helden als Atlanten des Himmels - symbolisiert durch die Flügelsonne - erklären. Diese Vorstellung müßte dann auf babylonischen Einfluß in Assyrien zurückgehen (1984: 197f.). Another example of the flowing water motif is shown on a cylinder seal from Assur, also dating to the 9th/8th centuries B.C. (Figure 40). lt is made from chalcedony and measures 49 x 17 mm. 158 The upper and lower border of the seal is constituted by streams of water. On the right side of the scene
156 The seal was published by Eisen (1940:52, no. 87, pi. 10:87).
157 Figures wearing the fish dress have been interpreted as priests. Comment Black and Green: "The presence of the type at doorways in Assyrian palace and temple sculpture, however, demonstrates the magically protective nature of the figure. So does the discoveries of figurines of the creature buried under the floors of buildings. Texts concerning the rituals for making such images and placing them about the house identify the type as a form of apkallu 'sage' .... Though perhaps sometimes imitated by priests, the being must in essence be a supernatural creature, and antediluvian sage whose traditions are reflected in the myths ofthe Seven Sages" (1992:83).
158 The seal has been found in Assur, but unfortunately the archaeological background is not very illuminating as to the precise date ofthe object (Moortgat, 1940:69, no. 638, pi. 76:638).

a priest wearing the fish-dress can be seen, in the usual ritual posture (see above). The right side is occupied by another worshipper wearing a long pattemed dress. A winged sundisk is supported by a bearded male figure in a running position wearing a pattemed dress. While the water and sun are
completely detached from each Figure 40 other, the running atlant probably symbolizes the rapid daily progression of the sun through the sky (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:199). The water encloses the scene covering both the celestial and terrestrial realm. There is a statue in the Pierpont Morgan Library which demonstrates the present motif group apart from the domain of miniature art. The object has been found in Khorsabad and from its archaeological context it can with a degree of certainty be dated to 722-705 B.C. (Figure 41). 159 The style is Neo-Assyrian and depicts a male figure standing on a pedestal. The head also ends in some kind of a platform which indicates that the statue was used for the support of another obj ect. 160 The figure is wearing a long beard and a long dress from which his toes are protruding. The dress is held together by a broad belt. He can be identified as a god, since he is wearing the double homed crown normally associated with Neo-Assyrian deities on his head. The god is holding a vase with both hands in front of him which is slightly tipped to one side, allowing the water to flow out from it. The water runs into a stream flowing down on his dress. Similar streams are depicted in vertical curved lines running over the front and the back of the figure's garment. The god can be readily identified with the water- and rainproviding god Ea who is bestowing rain on the earth. No celestial or solar connotations are discemible which is also due to the limited potential of a statue to communicate
iconographic contexts. Figure 41
159 The statue was published by Ward (1910:fig. 662a/b; cf. also Loud and Altmann, 1938:pl. 47:5). 160 Unfortunately, we have not been able to determine the measurements ofthe statue.



210 5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
As a final example of the waterproviding god motif group, Figure 42 may be taken. lt is found on a cylinder seal with unknown provenance which, however, display Neo-Babylonian influences (e.g., the dress of the figures), and can thus be dated to the ih and 6th centuries B.C. 161 lt combines to some extent the Assyrian and Babylonian influences discussed above. A Figure 42 bearded figure is in a running position. He is wearing an intricately patterned, knee-long dress with a dagger in his belt. His hairdress consists of six curls, and he is supporting a winged sundisk above his head with both hands. From the feathered wings of the sundisk, streams of water are emanating, while the stream to the right is flowing toward the hand of an adorant who is facing the atlant. The worshipper is wearing a long patterned dressed, and has his one hand raised in a gesture of adoration, while his other hand is receiving the water. Around the atlant and the winged sundisk streams of waters are depicted which surround the motif in a rectangular shape: "Diese Form des Wasserstroms erinnert an ältere 'apsu-Darstellungen' im babylonischen Gebiet.... Auch dort wird eine gedankliche Verbindung zwischen Süßwasserquellen und Regen hergestellt, die in Assyrien im Allgemeinen fremd ist" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984: 199). With regard to the identification of the figure in a running position, the hairdress would point toward the fact that we are confronted with a Neo-Babylonian representation of Labmu who is supporting the heavenly realm symbolized by the winged sundisk. The water-providing god motif group has illustrated the various worldviews which were in existence during the time period under consideration for our study. 162 Although the idea of the water-providing god is often
161 The seal was originally published by Layard (1847:pl. 31 :7; cf. Ward, 1910:no. 656; and Frankfort, 1939:219, fig. 67).
162 One has to exercise a certain degree of caution in the usage of the terminology. While the people ofthe ANE have not explicitly laid out their cosmology (Weltbild) in terms of a naturalistic depiction, they nevertheless worked with certain, often mythologically oriented, assumptions ofhow their world functioned, which at times become transparent in iconographic sources (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1990: 11-15). With regard to the biblical world view, Houtman proposes that the OT did not know an explicit cosmology (Weltbild) in the form of "eine allgemein akzeptierte, systematisch aufgebaute Theorie über das Entstehen, den Aufbau und die Ausstattung des den Menschen umgebenden Kosmos in allen seinen Teilen" (1993:283), but that there existed a world-view

associated with an anthropomorphized deity (Figure 37 and Figure 41), in other instances the natural phenomena of the rain and water-sources have been completely separated from a personalized religious concept, although semi-divine creatures which often serve as placeholders for the respective divinities are normally present. Finally, one has to mention the divergences between the Assyrian and Babylonian depictions of the motif which have been aptly discussed by Mayer-Opificius and to which our material is by and large limited. The fact that the water-providing god motif does not occur in the Syro-Palestinian context in a similar fashion during the time period under consideration,163 viz., in our selection of images, should, however, be taken into consideration with due caution.
5.2.3.3. The Sacred Palm Tree
The motif of the sacred tree has to be seen m close relation with the preceding water and rain motifs, illustrating the affinity between water and fertility, although the imagery also occurs outside the context of water (cf. below). Figure 43 depicts a scene found on a limestone cylinder without known provenance, measuring 68 x 18 mm. The style is Assyrian, and the seal has been dated to the Iran Age I, ca. 1250-1000 B.C. In the center of the image a palm tree is standing in a vase on top of a stylized mountain. Above the tree there is a winged sundisk with extended hands from which streams of water flow down on both sides of the tree into vases on the ground. On the right band of the tree a worshipper is standing, possibly the Babylonian king. 164 He is wearing a beard, a cap, and a long dress, and has his hands raised in a gesture of adoration. On the other side the tree is flanked by a priest wearing the fish-dress, carrying a bucket and (possibly) a palm fruit in his hands. The image is ornamented on the upper and lower border with two intertwined curved lines Figure 43
(Weltanschauung), a certain perception of the world which centers around the cosmological activities of Yahweh which are discemible behind all natural phenomena (Houtman, 1993:299-317).
163 I.e., except for the occurrences of the winged sundisk with water streams emanating from its wings discussed above.
164 The seal has been published by von der Osten (1934:61, no. 416, pi. 28:416; cf. Frankfort, 1939:213, fig. 65).

and five hatched triangles. These omaments clearly represent flowing water and mountains, the characteristics of Ea, the Babylonian mountain-god and water-god. 165 That the sacred palm tree enjoyed special attention throughout the NeoAssyrian period, is shown by Figure 44, a cylinder seal from the 9th/8th centuries B.C., made from yellow marble, measuring 37 x 14 mm. 166 lt represents a similar depiction of the motif as found on the preceding example. The sacred palm tree is at the center of the scene, although its depiction is more schematic and only the large leaves allow for a positive identification of it as a palm tree. 167 Above the tree there is a winged sundisk with a feathered tail which clearly shows its affinity to the depiction of sun rays. From the sundisk two streams of water are coming forth, flowing downwards along the sides of the sacred tree. Two bearded worshippers wearing long dresses are flanking the tree and the streams of water. While their one hand is raised in adoration, their other hand is grasping the stream of water. This gesture is significant, since it shifts the focus for the worshippers as passive adorants toward active participants in the action. Behind the worshipper on the left side, two plants on long stems are visible, possibly ears of com, indicating the fertility connotation of the
Figure 44
scene. The combination of sacred tree and winged sundisk have cosmological connotation, symbolizing the ordered world. Comments Keel with regard to a similar depiction: "Die geflügelte Scheibe und der stark stilisierte Baum stellen die geordnete Welt dar, die als Lebensbereich aus Himmel und Erde besteht" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:45, fig.
165 The motif of the sacred palm tree surrounded by water may have had a climatic origin: "Diesem Bild liegt gewiß ein tatsächlich praktizierter Vorgang zugrunde. Es ist anzunehmen, daß u.a. die Palme als Vorbild für natürliche und künstliche Formen des Sakralbaumes diente. Bekannt is [sie] es, daß die Palme unter günstigen Bedingungen wie z.B. im Sumpfgebiet des südlichen Mesopotamien - ohne Pflege wachsen kann. Schon ein wenig weiter im Norden, z.B. in Uruk, aber gedeiht sie nur in bewässerten Gärten. Diese bedurften einer intensiven Bearbeitung. Der vielfältige Nutzen, den die Palme für die Bewohner des südlichen Zweistromlandes hatte, machte es verständlich, daß vor allem sie zum 'Sakralbaum' wurde" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:205).
166 The seal has been published by Porada (1948:77, no. 644) and is housed in the Pierpont Morgan Library. 167 We will see below that the portrayal ofthe palm tree becomes even more schematized.

51).168
Another interesting aspect of the sacred tree motif is found on a jasper cylinder seal housed in the BIP, measuring 45 x 17,6 mm (Figure 45). 169 Stylistically, the seal can be dated between 850-800 B.C. and is of NeoAssyrian origin. The seal is incised with the name and position of its owner, reading '(belonging) to Minu-epush-ana-ili, officer of grain storage' (Collon, 1987:77). In the middle of the scene the sacred palm tree is depicted. lt is profusely omamented, and rests on a stylized mountain. Above the tree a winged sundisk with a feathered tail is depicted, in which the upper body of the sun-god is visible, facing to the left. From the wings two streams of water are flowing downwards into vases. In similar fashion to Figure 44 two worshippers are flanking the tree, the winged sundisk, and the water, while they are grasping the streams of water.170 Above the worshippers, a crescent and seven-star are visible. Behind the worshipper on the right side, a female figure is standing on a pedestal which can readily be identified as the Assyrian Ishtar. She is wearing the homed crown, and is dressed in the typical knee-long skirt with a long overcoat. The goddess is fully armed with bow and quiver on her back, and a sword attached to her belt. In her one hand she is holding a ring of pearls, while the other hand is raised in a gesture of blessing. Above her head the eight-pointed star, her celestial symbol, can be seen. While the combination of sacred palm tree and winged sundisk with streams of water denote the totality of the inhabitable world (Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:pl. 2), the connection to the astral deity enhances the spectrum of contexts for this motif. Ishtar, although depicted in füll armor, is linked to the idea of fertility through the sacred tree, an idea which seems to go back to the Middle and Late Bronze Age Figure 45
168 With regard to the origin ofthe motif, we have discussed its original Babylonian setting in connection with Figure 43: "Der vom Wasser umflossene Baum dagegen ist gewiß wie bereits ausgeführt - ein babylonischer Bildgedanke, der im 9. Jahrhundert in Assyrien übernommen wurde" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:205).
169 The seal has been published by Collon (1987:77, no. 345; cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:pl. 2).
170 Since the gesture of grasping streams of water appears to be somewhat obscure, one wonders, ifthe scene does not represent a certain ritual, while the streams ofwater have been replaced by a tangible object, e.g., the streamers.

Figure 46
during which a naked goddess which was normally identified as 'Asherah, was depicted in close association with the sacred tree (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:29-34, 62f.). The war-like Ishtar has replaced the naked goddess ('Asherah), and a combination of warrior and god of heaven attributes can be observed. A representation of the sacred tree motif found in Syro-Palestine, although with unknown provenance,171 can be seen in Figure 46. The impression stems from scaraboid which is inscribed with Hebrew letters on the reverse, reading '7:l p 1i1'p'?n'? '(belonging) to IJilqiyahu, son of Pady'. The seal measures 17,5 x 16,5 x 9,2 mm and is made from limestone. 172 Lemaire classifies the seal as Judean and dates it palaeographically to the end of the 8th or the 7th centuries B.C. The scene is relatively clear and shows a stylized palm tree in the center which is flanked by two adorants. Both worshippers are presumably male, and are wearing knee-long pattemed dresses and a flat hat. They seem to be holding onto the tree, while they are dancing around it: "... ils sont toumes vers un arbre stylise vers lequel ils tendent les bras" (Lemaire, 1986:311). Comment Keel and Uehlinger on the significance of the stylized tree in Syro-Palestine during the Iron Age IIB:
Der stilisierte Baum als numinoses Machtsymbol, das von den Mischwesen bewacht bzw. beschützt wird ..., symbolisiert mythologisch den Gottesgarten, konkret den Tempel- und Palastbereich, abstrakter den geordneten irdischen Kosmos und das durch diese Ordnung ermöglichte Leben. Er erfüllt hier nicht mehr die eher 'weiblichen', ursprünglich von der Göttin wahrgenommenen Funktionen des Nährens und der Lebensvermittlung, sondern ist in den Dienst eines - im Bild selbst nicht dargestellten - königlichen Gottes genommen und repräsentiert dessen umfassende Segensmacht (1992:265f.).
lt is, however, difficult to determine, how and when an iconographic motif like the sacred tree is turned into a numinoses Machtsymbol [numinous symbol of power], and if it can be easily dissociated from its original context of fertility, its affiliation with the goddess 'Asherah, and finally be transferred to a divine king which would be found in Yahweh. In our view, this would require such an amount of religiously motivated transferal which

cannot be substantiated by the dichotic relationship between Yahweh and 'Asherah as related in the Hebrew Bible. Furthermore, the relationship between Yahweh and 'Asherah as found in iconographic and literary extrabiblical sources, is far from explicit. 173 Nevertheless, the separation of the symbol from its associated deity has been noticed before and is in line with the increasing de-anthropomorphization of deities observed during the Iron Ages in Syro-Palestine. As a final representation of the sacred tree motif, a cylinder seal from Nimrud will be taken (Figure 47). lt is made from serpentine, measuring 27 mm in height,174 and was found in the Fort Shalmaneser (S. E. courtyard). Archaeologically it can be dated to the ih century B.C. The scene shows a greatly schematized palm tree in the center with a winged sundisk above it from which two streams of water are emanating and flowing into vases suspended in midair. 175 To the right side of the sacred tree a bearded worshipper is standing, wearing a long patterned dress. He has his hands raised in a gesture of adoration toward the winged sundisk. Above him there is a crescent and a seven-star, while in front of him a wedge-like object is standing upright which could be identified as the qan tuppi stylus, the symbol of the Babylonian Nabü. To the left of the scene a horned capride is raised on its hind legs toward another tree which is depicted in a more naturalistic way, but cannot be understood to be a second representation of the sacred palm tree. Again, no anthropomorphic deities are depicted, and the sacred tree - winged sundisk combination may stand for the Figure 47
173 Cf. the discussion on the relationship between image and inscription found at Kuntillet 'Ajrud: "Als Fazit [their italics] läßt sich festhalten, daß die Befunde von Kuntilet 'Agrud (und ijirbet el-Qom) keine zwingenden Argumente gegen die These einer weitgehend monolatrischen Verehrung Jahwes im Israel der EZ II B, wohl aber Argumente gegen [their italics] die Annahme einer weiblichen Paredros Jahwes in dieser Zeit liefern" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:282).
174 Unfortunately, no diameter is given. The seal has been published by Parker (1962:35, pi.
18:1).
175 Comments Parker: "I know of no parallel for the mound, which suggests a copy of the artificial tree, misunderstood" (1962:35). However, the style of the seal appears to necessitate a high degree of craftsmanship that one can expect that the seal-cutter was aware of what he was doing. Similar reduced representations of the sacred tree can be found elsewhere (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:45, fig. 51; Collon, 1987:79, fig. 355).



216 5. Goo AS wARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
water-god Ea, while the capride raised against the second tree might represent a female goddess of the Ishtar- or 'Asherah-type (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:243-245, fig. 222a-c). The sacred tree motif has been presented especially from the perspective of its affinity to the winged sundisk in combination with water and rain depictions. From a relatively clear portrayal of a palm tree, there have also been very schematized representations of the motif. lt appears that the sacred tree motif took the place of a deity, and thus must be understood as a representation of that god/dess. While the affinity to the Assyrian and Babylonian Ea and Ishtar has been observed, the Syro-Palestinian version of the motif seems to have been symbolic of 'Asherah, while fertility, but also cosmological order, is the predominant theme of this constellation.176
5.2.3.4. The Goddess in the Star Nimbus
A recurring motif group displaying attributes of the god of heaven metaphor is the depiction of the goddess in the star nimbus. Again, the specimens are largely restricted to the Neo-Assyrian period and the goddess can usually be identified as Ishtar. The first example of this motif group is found on a cylinder seal with unknown provenance, made from camelian and measuring 39 x 18 mm (Figure 48). Stylistically it can be dated to the 9th and 8th centuries B.C..177 The scene is complex and shows two gods standing on animals with a worshipper facing them. The worshipper is standing and has his hands raised in adoration.178 The male god in the center of the image is standing

178 Porada's interpretation of this gesture is interesting to note: "Greek soldiers of Alexander who saw it [the gesture of adoration] on a stela in Asia Minor interpreted it as snapping of the fingers. lt is quite possible that the worshipper did intend to attract notice by means ofthe snapping sound" (1947:62).

creature, although the Mischwesen has wings and the horns are pointing forwards and not upwards. The goddess is wearing a knee-long skirt with a long rohe above it, and the horned crown on her head, topped with a star. The goddess has raised her one hand, holding a star on a small standard. She is surrounded by a nimbus of stars, circling around the center of her body. The nimbus consists of an outer corona of distinguishable stars and an inner corona of globes, presumably representing stars as well. In the sky, in front of each god, there are two more nimbuses with unidentifiable gods in them, although they should be considered as sundisks, since there are rays emanating from them. Above the worshipper a seven-star can be seen. Ishtar and (presumably) Nabü are portrayed in a scene of worship, each standing on his/her attribute animal. The nimbus of stars identifies the goddess as Ishtar who, in Assyrian and Babylonian times, was associated with nocturnal celestial phenomena. Comment Keel and Uehlinger: "Die priviligierte Verbindung Ischtars mit den Sternen wird durch das Motiv der Göttin im Strahlenkranz [their italics] bzw. Sternennimbus besonders unterstrichen" (1992: 334). The goddess Ishtar in a similar position is found on another cylinder seal with unknown provenance which is made from chalcedony, measuring 33 x 16 mm (Figure 49). The extensive use of the drilling technique would date the seal to the same period as the preceding sample, i.e., the 9th/8th century B.C. The cylinder seal bears an inscription which refers to the name of the seal-owner, reading sei 1ka-bi-li-' '(belonging) to Kabili'. The centre of the scene depicts Ishtar in the star nimbus. 179 She is wearing a high crown topped with a globe, and is armed with a sword attached to her belt. Her hands are raised in a gesture of blessing. Although she is not standing on her animal, a capride is lying on the ground in front of her.180 A worshipper is facing her in the normal gesture of adoration. Behind the goddess there is a scorpion-man holding up a winged sundisk, although he could also receive the water streams emanating from the wings of the
sundisk. The sundisk is depicted in Figure 49
179 Note that the stars are portrayed as a corona of globes. The drilling technique simplifies the details ofthe image from stars to globes.
180 While one would normally expect the lion as the attribute animal of Ishtar, she also appears in connection with other animals or without an animal altogether.

a very schematic way. Behind the scorpion-man, a mus!Jussu dragon is crouching on a pedestal, having the symbols of Marduk and Nabu resting on its back. Interspersed between the various figures and elements, there are celestial and other divine symbols: seven-star, crescent, and rhombe. The depiction is typical for the portrayals oflshtar, although she is found in combination with solar iconography, i.e., the sundisk which, however, has been observed before (cf. Figure 26). The following four examples of the goddess in star nimbus motif group are of special interest, since they all have been found on Syro-Palestinian sites, and can be archaeologically dated, although none of them have been located in unambiguous strata, the objects being mostly surface finds. Figure 50 shows a scene found on a cylinder seal from Shechem. The object stems from the debris above the temple at Tell Balata, unfortunately preventing a reliable archaeological dating, but the style would point to a date in the 8th century B.C.181 lt is made from syenite and modeled in the Neo-Assyrian linear style.182 To the right of the scene, Ishtar is standing surrounded by a star nimbus which is designed from two half circles, whereas the stars are attached to the outer circle. 183 The goddess is wearing the feathered high crown and a long pattemed dress. She has raised her hands in a gesture of blessing. Behind her there is an omamented marru
Figure 50
spade standing upright,184 above which Ishtar's eight-pointed star is suspended. On the left of the image a male bearded figure is standing. He is wearing a pattemed long dress and a cap, and has his one hand raised in a gesture of adoration. Behind him there is a long vertical line which almost appears to be part of the garment, perhaps a cape. The figure can generally be identified as a worshipper, maybe as a representation of the king before Ishtar.185 The object
181 The seal is housed in the Palestine Museum, Jerusalem, and was published by Parker (1949:7, pi. 1:6; cf. also Winter, 1983:458, fig. 500; Schroer, 1987:276, fig. 97 [less clear drawing]; Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:333f., fig. 287). 182 Unfortunately, no measurements are given.
183 Tue depiction of the stars is somewhat schematized, they are mounted on short pins, but can be identified as stars from comparative material (see below). 184 Parker described the marru spade as "a lance with streamers" (1949:7).
185 Keel and Uehlinger have identified the figure as the Assyrian king, but the image is too schematized to allow for such an identification.

in between the adorant and the goddess can be recognized as a Babylonian fire altar or incense burner on which the worshipper is probably offering incense, since the flames are stylized above the altar. 186 Between the altar and the goddess an object is lying on the ground which cannot be identified. Above the altar a seven-star can be seen.187 A similar scene is found on an agate stamp seal from Dor (Figure 51). Although it has been found in a Late Roman stratum, the object is clearly out of its archaeological context and should rather be dated to the gth or 7th centuries B.C.188 The style is linear Neo-Assyrian, and the scene shows Ishtar in a star nimbus, standing on a double line. The stars are in similar fashion to Figure 50 depicted in a schematic way through globes mounted on pins which are attached to the nimbus. Ishtar appears to be wearing a long dress and the high crown which we have already encountered numerous times. Above the scene there is a crescent. A worshipper is standing facing the goddess. From the photograph it appears that the figure is female. She is also wearing a long dress, and has raised her hands in a gesture of adoration. On her hands she is holding a flat object, offering it to the goddess. In all probability we could be confronted with a woman offering an ash cake or a bread to Ishtar: "Das Räuchern auf den Dächern, Trankopferspenden sowie das Darbringen von Broten oder Kuchen war gerade auch im assyrischen Kult von Adad und Ischtar populär. .." Figure 51 (Winter, 1983:565).
186 Besides the apparent function in the ritual of burning incense before a god/dess, the fire altar is also symbolizing the Babylonian fire god Nusku (Klingbeil, 1992b: 111).
187 Cornments Winter on the seven-star: "Die sieben Punkte hatten ursprünglich eine andere, nicht mit Sicherheit zu bestimmende Bedeutung (7 Lossteine, Götter von 7 Städten, vielleicht aber auch ein Zusammenhang mit der 7-blättrigen Rosette der Inanna/Ischtar.... Eindeutig als Gestirn (Plejaden) sind sie erst in der Kerkuk-Glyptik belegt.... In neuassyrischer Zeit wurde ein Dämonengruppe (Sebettu) damit identifiziert..." (1983:459, n. 1294).
188 The seal is found in the Archaeological Institute of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and was published by Stern (1992:68, fig. 85; cf. also Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:334, fig. 288c).

Figure 52
Following along the same iconographic tradition, another Syro-Palestinian stamp seal depicts lshtar on her own without the context of an adoration scene (Figure 52). The scene is found on the base of an ovoid stamp seal, measuring 17, 1 x 14 x 7,6 mm, a surface find from Ashdod, and has been dated to the ih century B.C. 189 The goddess is portrayed facing toward the left, wearing the high feathered crown, and a patterned long dress. The knee-long skirt with the long dress over it, as found in Figure 48 and Figure 49, does not seem to have been a feature of Syro-Palestinian depictions of the motif, since the goddess is always dressed with the long patterned skirt. On this seal she also has her one hand raised in a gesture of blessing, and is surrounded by a double nimbus with the stars attached to the outer circle. 190 lt is interesting that lshtar is depicted on her own which demonstrates her importance in Syro-Palestinian glyptic during the Neo-Assyrian time period: "lschtar ist die einzige unter den
Figure 53
assyrischen Göttern, die im Palästina der EZ II C auch auf Stempelsiegeln in anthropomorpher Gestalt erscheint. Dies scheint auf den ersten Blick für eine größere Bekanntheit bzw. Breitenwirkung der Göttin zu sprechen" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:334). As a final example of lshtar in the star nimbus, the stylistically different but otherwise almost identical depiction of the goddess found on a scaraboid from Bet Shean may be taken (Figure 53). lt is a surface find, made from limestone, measuring 22,5 x 18 x 10,7 mm. 191 The scene has been worked in the Neo
189 The seal is unpublished from the Clark Collection (no. 212), YMCA Jerusalem (cf. Schroer, 1987:276).
190 The stars are, however, not presented as mounted on pins, but rather on the furthest points oftriangles connected to the outer nimbus.

Babylonian drilling technique, rendering the motif in a rather schematic way. Thus the corresponding dating would assign the seal to the 7th or 6th centuries B.C., making it the latest specimen of this motif group.192 This depiction follows the previous one closely, except for the manufacturing technique. The goddess is facing to the right, raising one arm in the familiar gesture. The headdress is probably a high crown with horns, as the two small globes on top of the crown would indicate. Her hairstyle is clearly modeled, and she is wearing a long dress with ornamentation. She is surrounded by a single nimbus to which eight stars are attached which confirms the identification of the familiar motif of the eight-pointed star with that celestial goddess. 193 The goddess in star nimbus motif was a popular image during NeoAssyrian and Neo-Babylonian times, and the frequency of the motif in Syro-Palestine demonstrates its usage in that region, although the depiction is not completely in line with the specimens coming from other parts of the Neo-Assyrian empire, viz., those without a known provenance as the different dress shows. The motif is normally part of a worship scene, whereas the limited space on stamp seals reduced it to a mere depiction of the goddess alone. The emphasis is always on the celestial phenomena, i.e., the stars which are accompanying the goddess, and her identification with the Assyrian Ishtar is clearly demonstrable, as the images with the eightstarred nimbus show.194
Ishtar has repeatedly been associated with the •'Diliil nJ?D from Jer 7: 18 and 44:19 (Winter, 1983:564-566; Schroer, 1987:273-276), whereas the characteristics of the cult, i.e., the baking of cakes or the burning of incense, would perfectly fit the Assyrian goddess who com~ands epithets like sarrat same 'queen of heaven' or belet same 'lady of heaven' in Assyrian texts (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:335). However, the reception of this motif in Syro-Palestine does not allow for an exclusive identification of
the • 'Diliil nJ?D with Ishtar,195 and other goddesses like Hathor, 'Anat,
192 The motif of Ishtar in the star nimbus is not found among the Syro-Palestinian stamp seals from the Persian period (cf. Klingbeil, 1992b: 123f.). 193 Together with Figure 48, this is the only limitation ofthe number of stars to eight.
194 Comments Schroer: "Vor allem ist es die Inanna/Ischtar, die in ihrer uranischen Gestaltals Göttin der Morgenröte, des Abends, der Sterne - verehrt wurde. Ihr Symbol, der Morgen- und Abendstern, begleitet ab der altbabylonischen Zeit die anthropomorphe Darstellung der Göttin oder vertritt sie" (1987:275).
195 "Die Siegel ... zeigen, daß die assyrische Göttin im Palästina der EZ II C primär in der astral konnotierten Erscheinungsweise im Strahlenkranz bzw. Sternennimbus bekannt war. Sie vermögen aber, für sich allein genommen, deren Identifikation mit der 'Himmelskönigin' kaum zu tragen, da sie überwiegend aus Zentren und

•'Oflii1 nJ?O, but the support which is found in an originally anepigraphic stamp seal with an added Hebrew inscription which shows a fourwinged goddess (' Asherah) above a stylized palm tree opposite a twowinged bearded god on a winged Mischwesen seems tobe somewhat singular and indirect (Figure 54): 196 "In einer lokalen interpretatio judaica [their italics] hätte der judäische Besitzer die Konstellation auf Jahwe (über einem 'Keruben', vgl. Ps 18,11) und Aschera als 'Himmelskönigin' (über dem stilisierten Baum) beziehen können" (1992:389). Nevertheless, we would agree with a multiple
identification of the •'Oflii1 nJ?O determined by geographical and chronological factors. 197
5.2.3.5. The Celestial Throne
In close proximity to the preceding motif group, the following three specimens will depict gods or goddesses on a throne ornamented with celestial symbols or under a canopy-like structure with similar decorations. All images present the 'queen ofheaven', viz., 'king ofheaven' themes. Figure 55 is found on a cylinder seal in the Marcopoli Collection. lt is made from serpentine, measuring 32 x 13 mm. The style is Neo-Assyrian
Transmissionsposten der assyrischen Verwaltung stammen ... und keinen Schluß auf die lokale Rezeption der Göttin erlauben" (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:335).
196 The seal has been published by Bordreuil (1986:no. 58). The interpretation of the scaraboid has presented a number of difficulties: the Hebrew inscription seems to have been added later on and is not clearly distinguishable, reading a highly doubtful y~[y]hw
[s]lm (Uehlinger, 1993:275). Furthermore, the seal is unique in its iconography and thus should be used cautiously for far-reaching conclusions: "To remain with our example, B 58 [Figure 54] shows a religious representation in which its Judaean owner might [his italics] have recognized Yahweh and the 'Queen of Heaven', possibly identified with Asherah.... But as the seal remains unique for the time being, we have no other documentary evidence to test such an hypothesis against other documentary evidence" (Uehlinger, 1993:276).
197 One has to bear in mind that the references to the •'1:lrlii'l n:hr.i in the Hebrew Bible are limited to the time of Jeremiah, which increases the difficulty in creating a consistent biblical image ofthe goddess.

and it can be dated between 900-700 B.C.198 On the left side of the scene a sacred tree is depicted below a winged sundisk. Next to it a male worshipper is standing facing toward the right. He is wearing a pattemed dress and his hands
are possibly extended to the Figure 55 front, although this is not clearly distinguishable. In front of the worshipper the marru spade is standing upright on the ground, followed by a Babylonian fire altar. Above these two divine symbols, a curved object is visible which cannot be identified. On the right side of the scene there is a throne on which a figure is seated. The figure is depicted unproportionally large, and is wearing a long pattemed dress. Although the face is not clearly distinguishable, it appears that the figure is female, since the hairdress is lang and no beard is detectable. She is holding a ring of pearls in her hand.199 Attached to the back of the throne, there are seven, possibly eight stars, mounted on short pins. In front of the head of the goddess a crescent is visible. lt appears reasonable to identify the goddess with Ishtar who is often found holding a ring of pearls. The astral context of the image would furthermore contribute to this interpretation. She is seated on a throne which through the stars is designated as divine, belonging to the celestial realm, identifying her as an astral deity, i.e., the 'queen of heaven'. An unpublished seal from the BIF depicts another variant ~f the celestial throne motif (Figure 56). lt is an achate cylinder seal with unknown provenance, measuring 20, 1 x 7 mm, and its Neo-Assyrian style points to a date in the ih century B.C. On the right side of the scene a scorpion-man is supporting a winged sundisk from which the upper body of the sun-god is emerging, facing toward the

right. Blessing hands, viz., streams of water, are emanating from the wings of the sundisk. To the left of the sundisk a bearded worshipper is standing, facing to the right. He is wearing a pattemed long dress and has his hands raised in a gesture of adoration. The center of the image is taken by a male god standing on the back of a bull which in turn is lying on a pedestal (a mountain?). The bearded god is wearing the high Assyrian crown topped with a star (globe), and is armed with a sword attached to his belt. He seems to be holding the bull on a leash with his one hand, while the other hand is grasping a ring and a bundle of lightning. Behind the god a canopylike structure is depicted leading upwards in a curve toward the head of the god. On its reverse side it is omamented with globes which should be identified as stars. The scene is completed by the symbols of Marduk and Nabü, the marru spade and the qan tuppi stylus, above which an eightpointed star is portrayed. The god can be identified as the Assyrian weather-god Adad on his attribute animal, the bull (cf. Vanel, 1965:fig. 78), holding the bundle of lightning in his hand. The star-omamented canopy sheltering Adad indicates the celestial dimension of the weather-god. Adad, the 'king of heaven' has to be understood as the male counterpart to Ishtar as the 'queen ofheaven' (cf. Weinfeld, 1972:133-154; Winter, 1983:566). As a final example of the god on a celestial throne motif, a conical stamp seal from 'Amman may be taken (Figure 57). The seal is incised on two sides and on the base, whereas our depiction is from one of the sides. The seal is made from camelian, and archaeologically it can be dated to around 650 B.C.200 The scene shows a god seated on a throne which is resting on the back of a canine. Although the <log has a long neck more suitable to a gazelle, it can be interpreted as a canine, since it has extended its paws
Figure 57
toward the front, while a gazelle would fold in its front legs. The <log is held on a leash. The god is wearing a high crown and has a protruding nose. No beard is detectable. Across the ehest of the figure, lines are drawn in order to indicate a pattemed dress. On the back of the chair five stars are attached in the form of small globes. The identification of the god is not easily undertaken, since the depiction is very schematic. While the <log of Ba' al is a known motif in SyroPalestinian iconography (cf. Figure 9), especially toward the Persian period, the canine has also been found in connection with the naked goddess on Old Syrian cylinder seals (Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:40,

fig. 37; Keel, 1994a:224). Geographical and chronological factors would point toward Ba' al as a possible candidate for the god on the seal. The god on the celestial throne motif is predominantly used to depict the 'queen ofheaven', viz., the 'king of heaven' in Neo-Assyrian iconography, while Figure 57 might be a Transjordan adaptation ofthat motif.
5.2.3.6. The God/dess in Creation
The following three images will present iconographic themes of gods or goddesses involved in creation, i.e., scenes where the deity is predominantly associated with nature or active in it. The first example is a complex scene which betrays Kassite influences. Figure 58 represents a cylinder seal impression found on a tablet from Nippur. The impression is 50 mm in height, and the tablet has been dated to the 16th-24th year ofNazi-Maruttsch (1307-1282 B.C.), i.e., the Late Bronze Age IIB.201 At the center of the scene a double-faced deity is depicted. He is wearing a wide flowing dress which broadens to such an extent at the bottom that another scene is depicted in it: a god in a kneeling position, is holding his arms in front of his body, possibly holding a vase as the god in Figure 41. From his shoulders streams of water are flowing downwards. The double-face god has extended his arms to both sides holding the front legs of two winged griffins which are raised on their bind legs in the typical 'Herr der Tiere' position. The scene is flanked by two plants, probably stylized trees. Above the scene the space is filled with birds which can be identified as eagles or birds of prey, since their beaks are sharply curved downwards. The upper part of the scene is concluded by a border of mountains which to some degree resemble the form of the dress of the two-faced god. In between the various elements, cuneiform signs have been inserted, although no convincing reading is provided.202 The scene depicts the Mesopotamian water- and mountain-god Ea who is the god in the kneeling position, Figure 58
201 The impression was published by Porada (1952:pl. 29:5; cf. Collon, 1987:178, no. 842).
202 "The signs on the right ofthe mountain deity (AN E? x x LIL) seem to make no sense, and those on the left can be read: ir dingir.mu dnin.lH 'servant ofmy god, Ninlil', but this is not fully convincing" (Matthews, 1992:114).



226 5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE !CONOGRAPHY
providing the water. The second figure is probably his attendant, the twofaced semi-god Usmu who is implementing Ea's blessings in nature, illustrated through the 'Herr der Tiere' motif.203 The eagles above the scene are known to represent the heavenly realm,204 while the horizon is constituted by the mountains. A whole cosmology is created in this interesting imagery in which the factors of water, mountains, heaven, and dominion over nature are the key elements. Another seal (Figure 59) from the BIF (no. 156a) shows an agricultural scene with the god in nature motif. The cylinder is made from steatite and it measures 52 x 18 mm.205 The style is Neo-Assyrian and it can be dated to the 9th century B.C. In the lower part of the image a plowing scene is depicted. A man is holding the plow behind a bull. Behind the man, another man is possibly sowing. In the upper right comer a bull is held by another man. Above an eight-pointed star and crescent can be seen. The upper left comer constitutes the most interesting part of the scene. A god on a pedestal with a knee-long dress and long overcoat is presenting three ears of com to a goddess in similar dress who is holding a round object which could be identified as a tambourine with respect to the position of the
Figure59
hands. The male god is wearing a homed crown and in his other hand he is holding an ax or hoe. Between the two deities a sevenstar is depicted while a bird, presumably a dove, is flying from the goddess toward the god. Although the bottom part at first sight seems to be representing a separated agricultural scene, it soon becomes evident that the god is positioned in such a way
203 Comment Black and Green on the function ofUsmu: "Isimud, or in Akkadian Usmu, is a minor god who functions as a minister to Enki/Ea.... His name seems to be identical with a ward (occurring in both masculine and feminine forms) explained in a commentary as 'with two faces', and so he can be identified with the two-faced deity ~ssociated in Mesopotamian art with Enki" (1992: 110).
204 "Die Vorstellung, den Himmel durch einen Adler zu symbolisieren, scheint es ... in neusumerischer Zeit bereits gegeben zu haben.... Auch auf anderen kassitischen Siegeln kommt der Adler über der Szene schwebend - einem ägyptischen Geier ähnlich gebildet - vor" (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:204). Interestingly, the heavenly realm on this seal impression is demarcated by a whole hast of eagles, probably indicating the cosmological connotation ofthe image. 205 The seal was published by Winter (1977:34) and Keel and Uehlinger (1990:25, fig. 13).



5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 227
that the bull functions as his characteristic animal, identifying him as the weather-god Adad who is extending the ears of corn toward the goddess Ishtar who demonstrates her willingness to receive his love via the sending of the dove (Keel and Uehlinger, 1990:40, fig. 38). The image has a strong connotation of fertility enhanced by the presence of agricultural activities.206 As a final example, a Tridacna shell from Arad can be seen in Figure 60. The incised shell is fragmented, its style may be described as SyroPhoenician probably manufactured in Syria, and the object can be dated to the 7th century B.C.207 The image shows the upper body of a bearded god emerging from a nimbus of Lotus flowers. He has a lang beard and is wearing a high conical headdress which resembles a Lotus flower. One hand is raised in a gesture of blessing. The nimbus is filled with the sun symbol consisting of rays and another two circles within the nimbus. Around the outer nimbus, Lotus buds on stems are depicted. They form a circle and closed buds alternate with blossoming ones. There is a stylized palm tree on the right of the scene, and feathery decoration to the left and above the motif. With Keel and Uehlinger we would suggest that the image does not represent a mere variation of the god with the winged sundisk theme, although the feathery wings are in close proximity to the image: "Weder dieser Gott noch die Gestalt, zu der das darüber gewölbte Flügelpaar gehört, ist mit dem assyrischen 'Mann/Gott in Flügelsonne' ... einfach identisch.... Da Flügelpaar und Lotusnimbus nicht zusammengehören, kann ihre Trennung auch nicht der Ignoranz des Künstlers angelastet werden" (1992:396, n. 373). Thus iconographically a combination of sun-god with creator-god has been
Figure 60
206 Winter comments about the meaning of the dove in connection with the goddess for ANE iconography: "Die vorderasiatische Göttin mit der Taube kann ihren Ursprung bereits im 3. Jahrtausend v.Chr. in Mesopotamien haben. Ikonographisch nachgewiesen werden kann sie mit Sicherheit erst seit dem Beginn des 2. Jahrtausends (altbabylonische Terrakottareliefs). Vor allem in Syrien scheint die Taube in dieser Zeit zu einem bevorzugten Begleittier der Göttin geworden zu sein" (Winter, 1977:76).
207 Tue shell has been published by Brandl (1984:77, fig. l; cf. also Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:395-397, fig. 337a; Keel and Uehlinger, 1993:297, fig. 10).

accomplished in this scene,208 since the Lotus flower is clearly associated with creative power.209
5.2.3. 7. The Winged Sphinx
Although this motif group does not necessarily concentrate on depictions of gods as such, the frequent motif of the winged sphinx in ANE - and especially in Syro-Palestinian - iconography can often be found in close association with deities, e.g., in a protective function or as a throne for the divinity. The scene depicted in Figure 61 is found on one of the famous ivory plaques from Megiddo. The ivories can be dated from the end of the Late Bronze Age IIA to the Iran Age IA, while this particular object might have been produced around 1150 B.C.210 The center of the scene is taken by a king sitting on a throne with a high curved back. The sides of the throne are formed by a standing winged sphinx, i.e., a human-faced lion with wings curved upwards. The king is drinking from a bowl which he raises with his one hand toward his mouth, while he is offering a Lotus flower to a female figure standing in front of him, identified by her richly ornamented dress and crown as the queen. Behind the queen an attendant is playing the harp, while behind the king another two attendants are filling bowls from a large jug similar to the one from which the king is drinking. The animal heads on the jug (lion Figure 61 and gazelle) have been
208 Keel and Uehlinger interpret: "Vielleicht ist der Gott im Lotusnimbus mit 'EI, dem Schöpfer der Erde' ( 'lqn 'r;,) [sie] zu identifizieren, der im 7. Jh. auch in Jerusalem verehrt wurde, hier vermutlich als ein besonderer Aspekt Jahwes als des Schöpfergottes" (1992:396). 209 For the original Egyptian motif, cf. Schroer (1987:55-57, n. 172).
210 The original publication is Loud (1939:pl. 2a-b; cf. Keel, 1977a:18-20, fig. 5; Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:70-72, fig. 65). We have only depicted the left half ofthe ivory plaque. As Keel and Uehlinger establish, two victory scenes are portrayed on the plaque, separated by three vertically positioned plants to the left ofthe harp player. The scene to the right, which is not visible here, consists of the following elements, for which Keel and Uehlinger's description may suffice: "Auf einem weiteren, sehr berühmten Elfenbein kehrt ein Fürst im Streitwagen vom siegreichen Kampf zurück.... Zwei nackte, an die Pferde gebundene Schasu-Nomaden gehen vor dem Wagen her.... Die geflügelte Sonnenscheibe über den Pferden erinnert nicht nur an den ägyptischen Ursprung und die Beliebtheit solcher Szenen unter Ramses III., sondern läßt den Sieger von der Gottheit gesegnet erscheinen" (1992:70; cf. Comelius, 1990:31).



5. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 229
identified as animal-shaped drinking cups (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:71f.). In between the various figures, doves are flying or picking the ground which symbolize messengers of joy, proclaiming the victory of the king over the Shashu nomads depicted on the right part of the ivory plaque. The image represents the celebration of the victory, while the winged sphinx serves as the throne for the king, being not primarily associated with a divinity, though representative of divine protection granted to the king. Another depiction of the winged sphinx can be seen in Figure 62. lt is depicted on a scaraboid with unknown provenance. The seal is made from a pale lapislazuli, measuring 14,2 x 10,8 x 7,7.211 The style can be described as Phoenician-Israelite displaying Egyptian influences,212 and the seal can be dated with similar specimens (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:289, fig. 249, 250b) in the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. The seal shows a winged sphinx facing to the right side which is standing on a double line in a passant position. lt is falcon-headed and wears the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The wings are pointing diagonally upwards in a straight line, and the tail is upwardly curled in. The sphinx is also wearing an Egyptiantype apron. In front of the Mischwesen an ankh-sign is depicted in a vertical position, while there is a sundisk above the scene. The position and constellation of the image clearly indicates the protective and apotropaic function ofthe falcon-headed sphinx. The falcon-headed variant of the winged sphinx was more common in Syro-Palestine than the human-faced type, mostly in connection with epigraphic seals. Sass correlates this phenomenon to the cautious approach toward anthropomorphic depictions in Syro-Palestine during that period (1993:226f., figs. 120-122), although it is highly unlikely that these Mischwesen were intended to depict deities, but rather as protective powers with solar Figure 62

212 Comments Keel on the Phoenician-Israelite glyptic style in the 9th and 8th centuries B.C.: "Während die judäische Glyptik im 9. Jh. in billigen Materialien (Kalkstein, Knochen) arbeitete und eher eine traditionelle ägyptische Königsikonographie pflegte, produzierte man im Nordreich in harten Steinen, zum Teil auch in sogenannten Halbedelsteinen. Die Ikonographie kreist weitgehend um Sonnensymbolik und geflügelte Schutzmächte.... Man hat diese Siegel früher generell gern als phönizisch eingeordnet, aber es wird immer deutlicher, dass es auch eine eigene israelitische Produktion gegeben hat..." (1994:233f.).

connotations (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:288-290). A rather anthropomorph depiction of a winged sphinx is found on an ivory plaque from Samaria, dating to the 9th century B.C. (Figure 63).213 Again, the style is Phoenician-Israelite which explains the clearly detectable Egyptian influences. The winged sphinx is standing on a pedestal facing to the left side. lts wings are intricately worked with a line pattem, probably indicating feathers. The wings appear as almost attached to the side of the sphinx. The Mischwesen is in a passant posture and its body is clearly feline, with a short upwardly bent tail. The face is smoothly shaven and the eyes are staring forwards. The sphinx is wearing a somewhat flattened double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt on its head with an Egyptian-type hairstyle, and an apron on its front legs resembling a short kilt. Around the Mischwesen, Lotus flowers are depicted in a stylized way. lt is not quite clear if the sphinx is protecting a sacred tree as on another ivory plaque from Samaria (Keel, 1977a:19, fig. 3). A more stylized variant of the winged sphinx motif can be seen in Figure 64. The scene is found on a cylinder seal from Tell el-Mazar. lt is made from green jasper, measuring 23 x 12 mm. The seal is worked in the Neo

Assyrian linear style with obvious Egyptian influences, and it can be dated from 900-600 B.C.214 The image shows two winged falconheaded sphinxes standing on a line, facing each other. Their wings and tails are upwardly curved, and the depiction is rather schematic. In between the two
213 The plaque was published by Crowfoot and Crowfoot (1938:pl. 5).
214 The seal was published by Yassine (1988:152, no. 304). Describing the archaeological context of the object, the author observes: "The importance of this seal is that it was found inside a mud brick wall (Area L, Square F2, Locus 2b), belonging to a major structure of the Neo-Assyrian Neo-Babylonian Period, destroyed in the Persian Period. Apparently the seal antedates the structure. The question is, did the seal fall whilst the wall was being made, or was it put there on purpose as an act of dedication?"

Mischwesen, a stylized ankh-sign is standing upright which has been omamented in such a way that it resembles the sacred tree. To the left of the scene a winged sundisk is depicted above the winged griffins. The association of the Egyptian ankh-sign with the sacred tree shows the Syro-Palestinian adaptations of this apotropaic
motif. Figure 65
Another variant of the winged sphinx motif can be seen on a scaraboid from Tell el-Far'ah (South). The seal is made from glass and has been chipped off in the lower left comer, measuring 17, 1 x 13 x 7,4 mm (Figure 65). Archaeologically, it can be dated to the 8th century B.C.215 The impression shows a winged sphinx in a passant position with its tail curved upwardly. Its head is the falcon-type, and instead of the normally expected double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, it is wearing a sundisk on its head. The interesting detail about this representation is the perspective from which the sphinx is shown. Both wings are depicted, one pointing diagonally upwards to the right, the other to the left, so that a sort of a semi-frontal view is created, further enhanced by the way of depiction of the short kilt which is covering the front of the sphinx. The sundisk on its head also seems to be a Syro-Palestinian adaptation of the Egyptian motif, underlining the solar connotation of the image. A bulla from Umm el-Biyara (Figure 66) shows the Transjordan provenance of the winged sphinx motif. The seal impression can be dated to the 7th century B.C.216 As often found on seals with both inscription and motif, the seal is divided by lines into three registers: the middle register is filled
with the iconographic motif, while the Figure 66

216 Most often the bulla has been treated from a palaeographic perspective: Herr (1978:162f.); Bienkowski (1990:94, fig. 5); and Lemaire (1993:5, 8, 23, fig. 6).

upper and lower registers bear the inscription (cf. 'Sass, 1993:204f.). The winged sphinx is facing to the right, standing in a passant position. lt is wearing an Egyptian hairdress, but no crown is distinguishable. The wing is long and depicted from the side. lt is curved slightly upwards, being ornamented with stripes. The inscription on the bulla is not easily read, and the drawing provided here (Figure 67) is to a certain degree a reconstruction. Palaeographically, the script is Edomite and the shape of letters would locate the inscription in the first half of the 7th century B.C. (Herr, 1978:162). The inscription reads qwsg[br] mlk '[dm] 'Qos-gabr, king of Edom' 217 which would identify the seal impression as belonging to the Edomite king mentioned in Assyrian texts from the reign of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal. To conclude this motif group, two representations of the winged sphinx functioning as a throne will be shown. The first one is found on an oval stamp seal from Cyprus, measuring 21 x 16 mm (Figure 68). Although no further archaeological context is given, the seal appears to be the product of a Phoenician workshop during the i 11 century B.C.218 The seal bears the
Figure 68
name of its owner at the bottom of the scene below the standing line, reading 7tbnL;l '(belonging) to Gadshar'. The scene shows a winged sphinx in a passant position, standing on a double line. The hairdress of the Mischwesen is Egyptian, the wing is pointing diagonally upwards, and the curved tail is also upwardly directed. The sphinx and its wings appear to function as the side supports of a throne, since the back rest of the throne is discernible on its back. A male figure is sitting on the throne. He is wearing a conical crown, a long hairdress, and is sporting a beard. While

his one hand is raised in a gesture of greeting or blessing,219 the other hand is holding a lance or javelin in a vertical position. Since the headdress and the context with the winged sphinx identify the figure as a deity, we would suggest that the scene represents a depiction of the Phoenician god Melqart sitting on his throne. Melqart was the city god of Tyre, and his worship spread throughout the Phoenician colonies, while the seal and similar images probably represent a depiction of a cult statue of the Phoenician god, erected in the city ofTyre (Culican, 1960-61:41).220 A similar depiction of Melqart may serve as a final example for this motif group. Figure 69 can be found on a scarab from Tharros, Sardinia which has been discovered in a grave dating from 600-400 B.C.221 At the bottom of the scene the typical Phoenician cross-hatched and arc-shaped exergue can be seen which normally denotes '"celestial terrain,' the mountainous dwelling of the gods, indicating that the scene represented is cosmic or celestial" (Culican, 1969:55). The sphinx is standing above the exergue and is depicted in the now familiar Egyptianizing fashion with the Egyptian hairstyle and the upwardly curved wings, supporting the side of the throne of which the back rest is visible. The god is wearing a conical crown with a pointed peak, and his hair is curling upwards from under it. In the front an uraeus is attached to the crown, while a tassel can be seen on the back of the hat.222 The god is dressed in a cross hatched cape which covers the arms. He is holding a camel stick in his one hand resembling the w3s-scepter, while the other hand is extended in the greeting gesture, similar to Figure 68. Directly in front of the god a spear-like object is standing on the ground in an
upright position. Figure 69
219 The gesture seems to be different to the position of the hands encountered on NeoAssyrian cylinder seals (e.g., Figure 32). The Phoenician god seems to extend his hands with the palm turned away from him in a vertical position, while the Neo-Assyrian gesture normally appears to have the palm turned upwards in a horizontal or diagonal position.
220 Melqart also appears in Ba'al-like posture as the smiting god, while he has been described as the Ba'al of Sidon and Tyre (Klingbeil, 1992b: 109).
221 Culican has published a number of Phoenician scarabs from the various Phoenician colonies depicting the god Melqart (1960-61 :46, fig. ld; cf. Keel, 1977a:32, fig. 15).
222 lt also appears possible to identify these two objects as bull's horns. However, the more Egyptianizing uraeus seem to be more probable in a Phoenician context.



234 5. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
The winged sphinx motif was prevalent in ANE iconography throughout the 1st millennium B.C.,223 especially throughout the Syro-Palestinian region, since most of our examples stem from this area. The original Egyptian solar motif was brought via the Phoenician coastal line to the Levant, while the addition of the wings enhanced the significance of this apotropaic symbol (Keel, 1977a:35). Chronologically, the sphinx seems to have first served as a throne for a human king, followed by depictions of the sphinx on its own in a protective position, often guarding an ankh-sign, while the later Phoenician variants portray the winged sphinx in its function as a throne for the deity, i.e., Melqart of Tyre. The throne supported by the winged sphinx has repeatedly been associated with the cherubim throne of the Bible which presupposes the identification ofthe winged sphinx with the biblical cherubim.224 While this notion seems to be correct, the function of the winged sphinx as a throne for a deity seems not to be represented in Palestine/Israel, except on terracotta fragments dating from the early Iron Age and possibly depicting empty thrones supported by winged sphinxes (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:190f.).225 While the presence of the winged sphinx in its protective function is noticeable throughout Palestine/Israel, its usage as a throne for a deity is restricted to the Phoenician realm of influence. Keel and Uehlinger comment on the function of the cherubim as throne-bearers: In den aus Löwen (Leib), Vogel (Adler- oder Geierflügel) und Mensch (Gesicht) zusammengesetzten Keruben sind die höchsten Kräfte kreatürlicher Gewalt vereinigt. Als Thronträger charakterisieren diese Mischwesen die über ihnen thronende Gestalt - nicht ausschießlich, aber großmehrheitlich Könige oder Gottheiten männlichen Geschlechts ... - als übermächtigen König bzw. 'höchsten Gott' ... (1992:191). In Palestine/Israel the depiction of that imagery seems to have been limited to an empty throne or a sphinx in protective posture.
5.2.3.8. The Winged God/dess
Anthropomorph depictions of gods or goddesses with wings are primarily associated with the Iron Age IIB in Syro-Palestine exhibiting Assyrian influences.
223 And certainly already before that as weil.
224 This notion has been widely accepted: "Gegen die weithin akzeptierte Identifizierung der Kerubim mit geflügelten Sphingen wird heute nur noch von wenigen die Meinung vertreten, die Kerubim, besonders die von 1 Kön 6,23-28 seine menschengestaltig gewesen" (Keel, 1977a:18).
225 Our example from Iron Age IA Meggido (Figure 61) clearly associates the cherubim throne with a king and not with a deity.

Figure 70 is derived from a hone carving found at Hazor. lt can be dated to the first half of the 8th century B.C. and is of PhoenicianIsraelite style. Keel and Uehlinger comment on the distribution of similar images: "Darstellungen dieses Gottes scheinen in Phönizien und Israel recht verbreitet gewesen Figure 70 zu sein, wogegen sie in Juda bislang noch nicht bezeugt sind" (1992:220).226 The image shows a male god in a passant position facing to the left, standing on a double line. He is beardless and wearing a flat cap which is omamented with a Phoeniciantype cross-hatched design.227 He is dressed with a pattemed cape around his shoulders, and a short skirt. On his back he has four wings diagonally opposite each other, also pattemed in Phoenician fashion. His arms are extended to both sides, holding onto a branch of a stylized tree which can be recognized as the sacred palm tree on account ofthe form of its leaves. The young god without beard can be identified as the youthful Ba' al in his connotation as vegetation and fertility deity with celestial attributes: Jugendlichkeit und Flügelpaar charakterisierten schon in der SB-Zeit den Gott Ba'al; die Verdoppelung der Flügel in der EZ II B potenziert den uranischen Aspekt ebenso, wie sie die Allgegenwart des Gottes markiert. Die Blüten bzw. der Baum signalisieren einen engen Zusammenhang des Gottes mit der Vegetation; Blüte oder Zweig konnten schon in der MB II B in der Hand des Wettergottes erscheinen... (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:220). Another depiction of the four-winged god can be found on an inscribed scaraboid from Tello (Figure 71).228 The seal is made from agate, measuring 22 x 15,5 x 11,7 mm and has been dated to the middle of the 8th century B.C.229 On it depicted there is a male god standing on a double line facing to the left. He is wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower
226 The original publication is Yadin (1958:182, pi. 151; cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:220222, fig. 210). The object was found in the upper city ofHazor, stratum I. 227 The design may also indicate the hairdress which displays Egyptian features.
228 The seal has been published by Galling (1941:185f., no. 91, pi. 7:91; cf. also Keel, 1977a:200-202, fig. 150). Timm (1992:190) describes the scaraboid as being without provenance, while Galling and Gubel (1992:125, fig. 65) mention Tello as the place of origin.

Egypt and a short skirt.230 The god has extended his anns toward both sides holding a snake in each hand.231 Four wings are attached to his back, two pointing diagonally upwards and two in a diagonal downwards position. The wings are decorated with stripes. There are two streamer-like objects in front and behind the figure's head coming from above which could also be identified as a ? {Timm, 1993: 176). The inscription below the standing line can be identified as Moabite (Herr, 1978:158,no. 8; Gubel, 1992:123) reading JnJ?.!l:J 'b 'alnatan' which points to the name of the seal owner. Since the verbal forms in compound names which are starting with a J instead of a ', are unlikely Phoenician, the question arises as to where the seal was manufactured: "Inzwischen verdichten sich jedoch die Gründe dafür, daß mit Siegelwerkstätten in phönizischer Handwerkstradition Mitte des 8. Jhs. auf dem Boden des Nordreiches Israel zu rechnen ist" {Timm, 1993:177). Since the god on the scaraboid can be identified as Ba'al, the theophoric element of the inscription would correspond to the iconographic depiction on the seal which is not necessarily to be expected in ANE glyptic. Aside from the epigraphic evidence, one would anticipate the Moabite god Kemos on a seal from this region. However, the iconographic evidence points to a depiction of Ba'al, unless the iconography of these two gods was so close during that period that the attributes of the one god were transferable to the other {Timm, 1993: 177). Although the female goddess with four wings is usually associated with Neo-Assyrian influences (Winter, 1983:189) and uncommon in the SyroPalestinian region, the motif has been found on a scaraboid with unknown provenance bearing a Hebrew inscription dating to the 8th and 7th centuries B.C. (Figure 72).232 lt shows a naked goddess in an en face posture.233 She
230 We have chosen Gubel's line drawing as the most recent one. On Galling's and Keel's drawing (cf. note 228) the short skirt is striped and the facial features of the god are clearly distinguishable, while the crown is less clear.
231 If one compares the depiction ofthe objects held by the god on similar depictions, one could interpret them also as branches comparable to the image in Figure 70.
232 The seal was published by Bordreuil (1986: no. 44; cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:385387, fig. 331a).

has extended her arms to both sides holding a rod in each hand. On the rod a star or a flower is mounted. The wings are modeled and decorated in the Phoenician curved manner, while one pair is pointing upwards and the other one is pointing diagonally downwards. Her headdress is not easily distinguishable, since the seal has been chipped at the top, but it appears that she is has a pair of horns on her head reminiscent of the Egyptian Isis. The inscription is

Figure 72
Since the motif is somewhat uncommon in Syro-Palestine during the Iron Age IIC, an identification of the goddess has to remain tentative, but the female winged figure is bearing celestial attributes which would associate her with 'Astarte or 'Asherah, although the naked depiction would favour 'Astarte as a possible candidate for the figure on Figure 72. Keel and Uehlinger comment on the popularity of the winged naked goddess during the Iron Age IIC: "Das Fehlen der Nacktdarstellungen in Juda stimmt mit der literarischen Überlieferung überein, wonach 'Astarte besonders in den Küstenregionen breite Verehrung genoß, in Juda aber kein größere Bedeutung hatte" (1992:3 85). The scaraboid may thus be the product of a Northern Israelite workshop influenced by Phoenician glyptic traditions. Since the imagery on the seal remains exceptional, it appears advisable to exert some caution in connecting the naked winged goddess with the biblical 'queen of heaven', although the celestial connotations are clearly noticeable.234 The winged god/dess motif appears to have been prevalent during the 9th/8th centuries B.C., whereas its popularity was restricted to the Phoenician coastal belt and the Northern Israelite Phoenician-influenced
233 Sass contends, with regard to the position ofthe female goddess, that "frontality is a way of exhibiting female nudity" (1993 :236).
234 Speculates Uehlinger: "And nothing compels us to deny that another Israelite or Judaean
individual, g 'l bn s'l, could have recognized the four-winged naked goddess holding astral staffs shown on his [his italics] ... as a representation of the 'Queen of Heaven' either. Fascinating as both documents [Figure 54 and Figure 72] may be, they remain unique, and their weight for the religious history is thus limited in comparison to other seals which, being more conventional, may be related to a 'significant series' ..."

workshops who might have 'exported' Figure 71 to the Moabite realm. Although the uranian connotation of the motif is noticeable, the identification of the winged goddess with the 'queen of heaven' is not easily undertaken, while the male god displays attributes that would clearly associate him with Ba'al in a vegetation and fertility connotation.
5.2.3.9. Miscellania
Under this heading we will include motifs which display god of heaven attributes although the selection of such images for the present study is not of a sufficient quantity and significance to justify the formation of a motif group in its own right. An interesting motif is found on a cylinder seal impression from Toprak Kale (Tushpa), Turkey, dating to the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. (Figure 73).235 On the left side of the scene a winged griffin or bull can be seen in a passant position. In front of him a sundisk with rays (or a star) is depicted. To the right a cart is portrayed with its axle pointing forwards. The object which is pulling the wagon is not visible. The cart is depicted in such a way that it appears like a ship with one mast whereas a star is possibly attached to the top of the mast pole. Above the axle another star or sundisk is visible. The cart is followed by a worshipper in a walking position who has raised his hands in a gesture of adoration toward the wagon. The scene is demarcated by a line at the top and the bottom. While we are not aware of any close parallels for this motif, the imagery seems to represent a religious procession whereas the connotation is clearly celestial or cosmic. The affinity to Neo-Assyrian cult practice, i.e., the wagon and horses of the sun-god < going through the land, may be a

possible interpretation for such an image. Keel and Uehlinger understand the allusion to horses and chariots dedicated to the sun in 2Ki 23 :11 as a reference for such a religious practice:236 "Der
235 The impression has been published by Weber (1920:no. 412; cf. also Collon, 1987:161, no. 736).
236 The text in 2Ki 23:11 reads: 'And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house ofthe Lord, by the chamber ofNathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he bumed the chariots of the sun with fire' (RSV). A number of horse and rider statuettes has been found in Jerusalem (no wagons though) which could serve as an indicator for the presence ofthe worship of the Neo-Assyrian sun-god Sam~ (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:392f., figs. 333a-336).

Gebrauch von Pferden und Götterwagen ist typisch für die assyrische Divination in der Sargonidenzeit (Ende 8./7. Jh.), bei der gerade der allwissende Sonnengott Schamasch eine zentrale Rolle spielte.... Die Pferde dienten somit wohl als Medien für die Divination, die Wagen setzten den unsichtbaren Gottheit [sie] gegenwärtig" (1992:394). The date of the object illustrated in indicates the wide-spread presence of this cult practice throughout the Neo-Assyrian empire. Another interesting image is represented on a stone relief from Maltaya which is Neo-Assyrian or Babylonian in style, and can therefore be dated from the 8th to 6th centuries B.C. (Figure 74). The relief is 6 m in length and 1,85 m in height.237 Depicted on it, there is a procession of seven deities, each standing on his or her characteristic animal. The procession is enclosed by two male figures, each tumed toward the gods, having raised their hands to their mouth in a gesture of adoration. The bearded figures are wearing a lang pattemed dress and a high tiara which ends in a globe. Although it is possible to identify them as the Assyrian or Babylonian king, their twofold representation would point to the fact that we are confronted with two adorants, nevertheless attired in royal dress. The first god (from left to right) is depicted slightly taller than the remainder of the procession and his leading position may point to his preeminent role within the procession. He is standing on a dog-like animal and is holding the ring and rod in his one hand, while the other hand is grasping a curved object possibly a weapon. A sword is attached to his belt. The second deity is a goddess seated on a throne which has four globes (stars) attached to its back. She is the only seated deity, and is holding a ring in her hand. Her attribute animal is a lion. The third god is holding the same _objects in his hands as the first god, while he is wearing a high crown which ends in a platform, decorated with a star. He is standing on a bull. Gods number four and five are identically depicted except for the animals on which they are standing. Both are holding the ring and rod in their one hand, while the other hand is raised in a gesture of blessing. To their belts swords are attached. Number four is standing on a canine, while five is standing on a horse. God number six is in a similar position, standing on a bull, whereas the ring and rod have been
replaced by a three-forked bundle Figure 74
237 The reliefwas published byWard (1910:fig. 749; cf. also Wiseman, 1958b:17, pi. 8:1; and Pritchard, 1969b:314f., no. 537).

of lightning. The procession is concluded by another goddess, standing on a lion who is holding a ring in one hand, while the other hand is raised. All the gods are dressed in like fashion, and only the first god is wearing a slightly different crown. While one would expect the identification of this Assyrian pantheon as the next methodological step, we would suggest that the depiction is not directed at giving a comprehensive introduction to the Assyrian or Babylonian list of gods, but rather to demonstrate a religious ceremony in which various gods who have a certain sociological and hierarchical relationship with each other are included. Thus the image is not only anthropomorphically oriented but also sociomorphically, i.e., showing the sociological order within the pantheon, while we would go as far as to suggest that some gods portrayed in the scene might be identified as representing the same god or goddess.238 Uehlinger has demonstrated in a detailed study of an Old-Syrian cylinder seal which shows a divine audience scene that an image "stellt aber per se [his italics] nicht individuierte Größen dar, sondern wie gesagt Rollenträger(innen)" (1992:350). Thus an identification of the gods depicted in Figure 74 has to remain tentative, the more so, since its provenance is not known, and the names of gods varied in different localities.239
238 The identification ofthe deities has been the subject ofmuch discussion, e.g., the seated goddess and the standing goddess would both in accordance with their attributes be ideal candidates for lshtar, here represented in two different appearances which are, nevertheless, both characteristic of that deity, and have been encountered before. Along the same line, the god on the horse is likely to be a depiction of Samas, although he is depicted in like manner as the preceding deity. The god with the bundle of lightning standing on the bull may be identified as the weather-god Adad, although god no. three is standing on the same animal carrying differing weapons. The first god may be the king of the Assyrian gods, Asshur, portrayed in an elevated position, although his attributes are reoccurring throughout the whole procession. Pritchard suggests the following identification of the gods/goddesses (from left to right): Asshur, Ninlil (or lshtar ofNiniveh), Enlil, Sin, Samas, Adad, and Ishtar (1969b:314f.).
239 Uehlinger's article is an interesting case-study in iconographic methodology, since it concentrates on an individual image and tries to establish its meaning first from an iconographic perspective (1992:340, n. 12). Only then the image is related to textual sources, while it is especially interesting to note the change of textual paradigm Uehlinger applies to the seal: "Bei der namentlichen Identifikation der auf dem Siegel von Abb. 1 dargestellten Gottheiten bin ich ex hypothesi stark von epigraphischen Befunden aus Mari ausgegangen.... Nehmen wir ad experimentum [all his italics] einmal eine ugaritische Perspektive ein: Würden wir nur die mythologischen Texte aus Ras Shamra kennen, so hätten wir ohne Zögern vier der dargestellten Gottheiten namentlich als Ba'al (A), 'Anat (B), AJirat (C) und EI (E) identifiziert" (1992:355). While the image does not concem us here, his methodological approach is interesting: a different setting merits a completely different identification of the figures depicted on the image. Thus, not the identification of the involved deities is the ultimate goal in the iconographic interpretation - unless the image is clearly associated with an epigraphic source - but rather inner meaning and problem structure of the image become the preeminent focus.

Images displaying god of heaven attributes have been presented by means of nine different motif groups, while the ninth one comprised two individual images with different themes. lt has been demonstrated that the imagery displaying these attributes encloses a variety of widely differing objects which have been associated with each other by a common denominator, i.e., their celestial or cosmic connotations.
5.2.4. Gods with Warrior and God of Heaven Attributes
As a last class of iconographic motifs, images will be presented which exhibit both warrior and god of heaven attributes. While a number of the images below will resemble motifs we have discussed already under the preceding sections, the scenes presented will be of such a nature that they combine the two attribute groups.
5.2.4.1. The Smiting God with the Vegetation-Spear
An interesting motif is the smiting god whereas the weaponry of the deity exhibits the god of heaven attributes, i.e., the usage of vegetation as a weapon. We have limited our examples to one, although there are a number of images that depict this motif (cf. Vanel, 1965:177, figs. 36, 39, 41; especially Comelius, 1994: 140f.) The first example (Figure 75) of this motif is found on a stela from Ras Shamra (Ugarit). lt is made of white limestone with a rounded top, measuring 142 x 47-50 x 28 cm, a size which clearly indicates "that it is not a private monument, but an official stela that functioned in the cult of Ba'al at Ugarit" (Comelius, 1994:139). lt was found by Schaeffer in 1932, and has originally been dated to a date within the Middle Bronze Age, ranging from 19001750 B.C., but it appears evident that the original stratigraphic context was dubious so Figure 75
Again with regard to Uehlinger's seal: "Aber wer Texte (und Bilder) nicht nur hinsichtlich ihrer positiv dargestellten bzw. explizit geäußerten Behauptungen, sondern auch mit etwas Sensibilität für die ihnen zugrundeliegenden Probleme, also Texte wie Bilder in erster Linie als Problemträger [his italics] zu lesen versteht, wird die grundlegende Strukturanalogie zwischen unserem Siegel und dem ugaritischen 'AnatBa'al-Mythos kaum bestreiten können" (1992:355f.). There, however, one again arrives at the texts, and it appears that the text still remains a corrective measure against a uniformistic or retrospective interpretation of an ANE image.

that the original dating had to be reconsidered. From comparative material a date in the Late Bronze Age thus seems much more likely which would move the object to the time period under consideration for this study.240 The relief shows a barefooted male figure in a passant position facing to the right. He is standing on three lines under which a curved line can be seen.241 The figure is wearing a short kilt which is omamented with a horizontal stripes and held together by a broad belt. A curved dagger or sword is attached to the belt. The figure is wearing a helmet with a high point from which a pair of bull horns protrude to the front. He has a lang beard reaching to his ehest, and his hair ends in lang curls (cf. Figure 20). The god has his right hand raised above his head holding a club ready to strike, while the other hand is holding a spear in a vertical position with the broad blade pointing to the ground. The shaft of the spear spreads out into a plant, and not into a shaft of lightning as proposed elsewhere, since the iconography of the weather-god with the bundle of lightning is completely different from this depiction (Comelius, 1994:137, n. 2).242 In front of the deity a miniature figure is standing on a pedestal with one hand raised in a gesture of adoration.243 The identification of the figure does not present major problems, and we are confronted with a depiction of the weather-god Ba' al in his normal posture as the smiting god, but holding a vegetation-spear in his hand, thus establishing his close affinity to fertility and vegetation, combining warrior and god ofheaven attributes. Comments Comelius: ... Ba'al is not holding a bolt of thunder or lightning, but rather a plant or tree-like weapon with which he strikes down the serpent.. .. In the texts from Ugarit, Ba'al is described as a god who possesses lightning and thunder (KTU 1.3 III 23, 1.101 obv 3-4) and he is the bringer of rain and fertility (KTU 1.4 VII 29-31 and 1.16 III 5ft).
24° Comelius dates the stela between 1700 and 1400 B.C. and summarizes the various
positions on the chronology and comparative endeavours: "lt is believed that the stela can be dated in the LB age, although the terminus a quo may lie in the MB period. The stela contains a mixture of Syrian, Egyptian and Hittite styles ... typical of the Late Bronze Age" (1994: 139). Cf. Comelius for the original publication and a !ist of pertinent literature on the stela (1994:135f.).
241 The three lines and the curved line is once more repeated below, but is not depicted in our line drawing. The interpretation of the curved lines as mountains is not unlikely, but it rather appears tobe a simple decoration (cf. Cornelius, 1994:136, n. 1).
242 Comments Comelius: "lt is remarkable that not one definite depiction of Ba'al with lightning ... could be traced, not even on the seals.... More typical of Ba'al is the menacing figure with raised hand/weapon and tree/spear..." (1994:141).
243 lt is not quite clear what this figure indicates: a worshipper or another deity, since the figure is standing on a pedestal. The figure might be wearing the garment with rolled borders (Wulstsaummantel - cf. Schmer in Keel and Schmer, 1985:53-107), pointing to a royal figure which would be in tune with the gesture.

However, thunder or lightning is not depicted on BRJ. The only relationship with fertility is the vegetative top ofhis weapon (1994:141).
5.2.4.2. The Smiting God with the Bundle ofLightning
Another variation of the smiting god motif is the depiction of the deity with a bundle of lightning in his hand, thus transcending the mere warrior theme in using the lightning as a meteorological weapon. Figure 76 is found on a hematite seal with unknown provenance, measuring 20 x 10 mm.244 The style is Assyrian or Babylonian and the object has been dated to ca. 1000 B.C., although the motif is certainly older.245 Depicted on it, to the left side of the scene, there is a figure dressed in a long rohe. Since the figure is wearing a horned crown, it can be identified with a god or goddess. The deity has raised his/her hand in a gesture of blessing toward another god in a slit skirt. The god has raised his one foot onto a pedestal which is symbolic of his mountainous realm.246 He is wearing a two-pointed cap and no beard is discernible. 247 His one arm is raised above his head ready to strike, holding a scimitar with his hand, while the other hand is extended to the front, holding the double-forked bundle of lightning in an upright ·position, identifying him as the weathergod. Comments Vanel: "Le foudre est evidemment le symbole le plus caracteristique du dieu de l'orage.... Le foudre babylonien 'classique', avec ses deux branches aux zigzags reguliers ..., evoque sans doute l'eclair dechirant le ciel" (1965:164). Behind the weather-god a stylized fish is depicted standing in an upright position, possibly indicating the presence of a priest, but clearly betraying Babylonian influences. The scene is completed by an inscription reading df;amas da-a 'Samas (and) Aia'. If one presupposes any connection between the inscription and the image on the seal, we would be Figure 76
244 Tue seal is housed in the Pierpont Morgan Library, and was published by Ward (1920:pl. 14:100).
245 Cf. Moortgat who discusses a cylinder seal with an identical inscription and similar motifs (1940:51, no. 517).
246 The motif of the god standing on a mountain will concem us below (cf. Vanel, 1965:nos. 9, 17, 31).
247 The depiction is, however, of such a poor quality that these observations have to remain somewhat tentative.

confronted by a portrayal of the Samas depicted with the attributes and posture of the weather-god Adad, while the deity on the opposite side would be the wife of Samas, the goddess Aia. However, a depiction of Samas as the weather-god is uncommon, and it appears more in tune with the iconography of the cylinder seal to identify him as Adad. A Northem Syrian variation of the smiting-, viz., weather-god with the bundle of lightning can be seen in Figure 77. lt is found on an inscribed stela from Til Barsib (Tell 'Ahmar) and is made from basalt, measuring 206 cm in height, again a monument of substantial size (cf. Figure 75).248 Although without a certain archaeological context, the stela has been dated by its original excavators to the 12th and 11 th centuries B.C., but from a series of comparative monuments a date in the 10th or beginning of the 9th century seems more likely (Vanel, 1965:135). The stela is in the NeoHittite style. The monument has been broken off at the bottom, but a male god is visible facing to the right. He is wearing a short skirt or kilt with a broad belt to which a short sword with a rounded hand-grip is attached. The upper body is covered with a short-sleeved shirt. On his head he is wearing
Figure 77
a high crown with a rounded top from which four homs protrude, two to the front and two toward the back.249 The god is adomed with an intricately plaited hairdress with a long beard and a double plait on his back which reaches downwards below his shoulder ending in an upwardly curled spiral. His one arm is raised above his head in a striking position, brandishing a weapon which can be identified as an ax with a short hand-grip.250 In his other hand the god is holding a three-forked curved bundle of lightning which resembles the form of a 'W'. The three-forked form of the bundle of lightning is Hittite or Assyrian in character, while the two-forked type is usually found in Babylonian contexts. Above his head a winged sundisk and
248 The stela is housed in the Louvre and has been published by Thureau-Dangin and Dunand (1936:134f., pi. l; cf. Pritchard, 1969b:313, no. 532).
249 The position of the homs on the crown already exhibits Assyrian influences (Vanel, 1965:136).
250 Vanel argues that the smiting position with the ax in one hand and the bundle of lightning in the other hand, actually represents two iconographic motifs, i.e., that of the weather-god and that ofthe warrior-god, whereas these two imageries are shown as two
distinct deities in the Cappadocian tradition: "Elle sert en tous cas a montrer en lui un
dieu guerrier, ce qui est tout a fait conforme a la tradition cappadocienne du 'second dieu"' (1965:137).

crescent is visible (cf. Pritchard, 19696:no. 532).251 Unfortunately the stela has been broken off at the bottom, so that one cannot distinguish on what object the weather-god is standing. From comparative material a bull seems the most likely candidate (cf. Pritchard, 19696:fig. 531; see also below). The identification of the god with the bundle of lightning as the weathergod appears obvious, although the nomenclature may be different in this case. Inscriptions attached to the image and similar representation assign the name of the celestial storm-god Tarhunzas to the god which in the Hittite hieroglyphs is represented by a ,dW' reminiscent of the form of the bundle of lightning.252 This Tarhunzas must have functioned as a weather-god with a preeminent position in the Syro-Hittite pantheon.253 lt is interesting to note the aggressive posture of the figure which combines the god of heaven and warrior attributes in an expressive manner. The 'Assyrianized' version of the smiting god motif with the bundle of lightning is demonstrated by Figure 78, a stela found at Arslan-Tash. The stela is made from basalt and measures 135 cm in height. lt was found in the temple constructed by Tiglath-pileser III (744-727) which dates it with some accuracy to the second half of the 8th century B.C.254 The image shows a god in a striding
position facing to the right. He is standing on top Figure 78
251 Unfortunately, these details have not been reproduced in the line drawing which we have taken from Vanel (1965:183, fig. 68). It is a recurring problem with Vanel that he isolates iconographic elements relevant for his study, thus destroying the iconographic context ofthe image.
252 There is an unpublished basalt stela almost identical to Figure 77 in the Tel Aviv Museum, dating to the 10th/9th centuries B.C. Except for a cruder rendering ofthe motif, the image is basically the same. The inscription attached to the stela identifies the god as Tarhunzas, but gives further information in naming Hamiyatas as the author of the inscription: "Hamiyatas calls himself King of Masuwari, which .. . is the indigenous name of Til-Barsip, prior to its Aramaization. The inscription follows a stereotyped pattem describing the benevolence bestowed by the storm-god on Hamiyatas and concludes with a typical curse directed against whoever may damage the stela. Of additional historical import is the information that upon the command of the storm-god, Hamiyatas built a city, possibly the site where the commemorative stela was erected" (Merhav, 1987:no. 124).
253 Comments Vanel: "Comme il est appele parfois 'Tarhund du ciel' ou 'dieu de l'orage du ciel' et figure en tete d'une liste de dieux plusieurs fois reproduite, il est dans doute considere officiellement comme Je grand dieu de l'orage" (1965:137).
254 The stela was published by Thureau-Dangin, et al. (1931:65f., pi. 2:1; cf. Vanel, 1965:149, no. 71).



246 5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE lCONOGRAPHY
of a bull with his one foot on its homs, while the other foot rests on the animal's back. The posture is indicating a running motion, whereas the bull is depicted in a similar stance (Vanel, 1965: 149). The god is dressed with a short kilt over which he is wearing a long rohe. The borders of the dress are pattemed and the rohe is draped in such a way around the figure that a long striped pattern is flowing from the shoulder to the foot of the figure. The hairdress consists of a long beard and a bulk of long hair held together in a kind of chignon in the neck of the figure. On his head the god is wearing the high rectangular horned crown, customary to depictions of NeoAssyrian gods. Above the crown a disk is visible with rays depicted in it, possibly indicating astral symbolism (cf. Yadin, 1970: 199-231). The god is armed with a long sword attached to his belt which is pointing toward the back. On his shoulder he is carrying a bow and a quiver.255 His one arm is raised above his head in a striking or throwing position, while the other arm is extended diagonally downwards toward the front. In both hands he is holding a double three-forked bundle of lightning. From a Neo-Assyrian perspective the god can be identified with the weather-god Adad, whereas the three-forked bundle of lightning in the striking hand has replaced the normally expected weapon. He is now equipped completely with meteorological weapons and the character of the lightning as an attacking weapon becomes increasingly evident. lt is no longer held in a passive gesture in front of the god, but raised above his head with the intention to strike down on the imaginary enemy: "Le dieu de l'orage assyrien d'Arslan-Tash apparait donc comme un dieu guerrier en pleine action. Une telle image semble conforme aux textes ou Adad est nomme parmi les dieux qui repandent la terreur devant l'armee du roi" (Vanel, 1965:150). The single most important element in the identification of the weather-god remains the bundle of lightning (Abou Assaf, 1983:63), although bull and other elements often also serve as indicators that a depiction of the weathergod is intended. As to the origin of the lightning motif in the two- or threeforked forms observed in the preceding figures, Abou Assaf observes: "Aus den Darstellungen geht hervor, daß das zwei- oder dreizinkige Blitzsymbol in seiner letzten Form in der altbabylonischen Periode entwickelt wurde. Die besondere Verehrung des Wettergottes in jener Zeit brachte eine Bereicherung der Darstellungen des Blitzsymbols mit sich" (1983:56).
255 The unit of bow and quiver is normally depicted in such a schematic way (cf. Figure
25). Vanel incorrectly only identifies the sword: "II n'a pas d'autre arme, a l'exception
de la longue epee pendue ason cöte" (1965:149).

5.2.4.3. The Weather-God standing on Mountains
The following two images represent weather-gods standing on stylized mountains. Figure 79 is found on a hematite cylinder seal with unknown provenance, measuring 20 x 15 mm which has been dated to 1750 B.C. which corresponds to the Middle Bronze Age IIB, assigning the object to the chronological margin of the present study.256 The seal is incised with a rather complex scene in which the weather-god standing on three mountains is of predominant interest for the present study. On the left side of the scene a male figure is standing facing to the right. He is wearing an oval crown and a long rohe with rolled borders, while his one hand is extended toward a goddess standing in an en face position (cf. Figure 72).257 Her hairstyle is intricately modeled and she is wearing a sort of cape around her shoulders to which a veil may be attached on the back which only covers her one leg. Besides these garments the goddess is naked and her navel and vaginal area are emphasized. While her one hand rests on her hip, the other one is offering a vase toward a god who is standing in a striding position on three mountains.258 The god is wearing an oval pointed crown with a hom protruding to the front and a long curl on his back ending in a spiral: "Dieser [the pigtail] soll wohl seine jugendliche Schönheit und Manneskraft unterstreichen" (Winter, 1983:274). He has his one hand raised above his head in a striking position holding a club, although the club is of such small size that one realizes the abstraction of the gesture, since there is no enemy against whom the aggression could be directed. In his other hand he is holding a mace and another curved weapon which is not quite Figure 79
256 The cylinder seal has been published by Porada (1948:130, pi. 146:968) who classified it as Syrian belonging to the 'second Syrian group'. Cf. also Frankfort (1939:270, fig. 85) and Dijkstra (1991 :129, pi. 2: 1). Although the object is rather early for the chronological limits of the present study, the iconographic motif of the appearance of the weather-god continued tobe in use for a long time in the Syro-Palestinian realm.
257 Comments Winter about the origin of the semi-naked goddess: "Obwohl wie gesagt nackte Frauendarstellungen seit den Anfängen der Kunst im ganzen vorderasiatischen Raum belegt sind, ist der Ursprung dieser 'Frauenwelle' eindeutig in Syrien zu lokalisieren. Die frontale, plastisch-naturalistische Darstellung hat sich als Schöpfung der syrischen Kunst erwiesen" (1983:272).
258 Normally the god is depicted as standing on two mountains. The occurrence of three mountains is somewhat rare (Dijkstra, 1991: 129f.).



248 5. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
distinguishable. On the right side of the image two secondary scenes can be seen: at the bottom three figures are standing below a guilloche, while the upper comer is filled by a banquet scene of two seated figures filling vases from a large vase between them. The areas between the various figures are filled with symbolic elements: bull head birds, monkey, ankh-sign, etc. With Winter (1983:252f.) we would suggest that the scene in Figure 79 represents the motif of the holy wedding ceremony whose origins must be searched for in a Syrian context which is supported by the appearance of a banquet scene on the cylinder seal. The figure in the rohe with the rolled border has to be identified as the king or another royal representative who approaches the weather-, mountain-, or warrior-god on the mountains via the mediation of the semi-naked goddess.259 Taking a Syrian context into consideration for the interpretation of the motif, the god on the three mountains who exhibits both warrior (weapons) and god of heaven (striding over the mountains) attributes could be identified with the Syrian Ba' al Zaphon, as Dijkstra has demonstrated for a seal depicting a similar god striding over two mountains (1991: 130-137).260 Another cylinder seal which also may be of Syrian origin, shows a similar scene (Figure 80). The seal has been dated around 1200 B.C. and has no known provenance.261 The scene depicts a male figure standing on the left with a rounded cap and a knee-long garment which is draped over the shoulders. He is holding a spear in an upright position, facing toward the right side. On the right side, two figures are standing facing toward the left. One is dressed in identical fashion to the first figure, while the other is
259 "Damit erfüllt auch die 'sich entschleiernde Göttin' u.a. die Funktion einer Mittlerin, die ich als Hauptaufgabe der 'nackten Göttin' bezeichnet habe" (Winter, 1983:280). One wonders if the image depicts the holy wedding motif or a mediation scene, or possibly both. Maybe Winter's association ofthe goddess with a mediation-role is induced by his denominational background.
26° Frankfort was more cautious in the identification of the god: "lt would be exceedingly rash to name this or any other divinity on the Syrian seals. He is a Weather-god, ... and he is identical with a Weather-god bestriding mountains" (1939:270). However, from topographical and literary texts, Dijkstra suggests the identification of Mt. Zaphon with Mt. Nan(n)i which appears in Hittite inscriptions explaining the god striding over two or three mountains. For the other mountain Mt. Ha(z)zi is mentioned in the inscriptions. When there are three mountains depicted, Mt. Pishaisha may be a possible candidate for its interpretation (Dijkstra, 1991:131, n. 24). Mt. Nan(n)i = Mt. Zaphon (cf. KTU
1.16.1.6-9) is the superior of the two, viz., three mountains: "If our suggestion is right to look for Mt. Nana [Nan(n)i] under the northem crest of the Nusairiye Mountains which tower high around the basin ofthe Nahr el-Kebir, it is a typical whim ofhistory that this part of the mountain range today still is known as Gebe! el-Quseir, the mountain of castles or bastions" (Dijkstra, 1991:137). 261 Very little detail about the seal is given in the original publication (Ward, 1910:fig. 885).

wearing a long pattemed dress which is draped over one shoulder leaving the other shoulder naked. The person is holding an object in his hand which cannot be identified.262 Between the two figures on the right a homed capride is visible in a somewhat
awkward Gumping?) position Figure 80 with its head tumed backwards. The center of the scene is filled with a god standing on two high round-peaked mountains. He is proportionally smaller than the other figures, but his divine character becomes apparent from his posture and attributes. He is also dressed with the knee-long open dress, but is wearing a rounded cap with a rim. In his one hand he is holding a schematized club in an upright position, while the other hand is holding an ax, and not a Lotus flower as interpreted by Ward (1910:no. 885). Owing to Hittite influences, the god could be identified with the weather-god Teshub (Adad). To our knowledge no representation of the god striding over the mountains has been found in the Palestinian region, and is limited to a more northem provenance and an earlier time period, except for the seal from Tell edDab'a (Avaris) which has been discovered in 1979 and depicts a Syrian weather-god which has been identified by Porada as Ba'al Zaphon (Dijkstra, 1991:127-140; cf. Uehlinger, 1990:512-522, fig. 1).263 lt is interesting to note that the depiction of the mountains possibly links up with the topographical conditions of Syria during the 2nd millennium B.C. (cf. n. 260).
5.2.4.4. The Weather-Godfighting the Snake
Similar scenes have already been presented with the class of seals displaying warrior attributes, e.g., Figure 15 which shows Ninurta fighting Anzu, the homed snake with the bow. A variation of the theme is found in the following three images which portray the weather-god fighting the homed snake with lightning.
262 Ward originally identified the person as an attendant goddess, probably because the dress leaves the shoulder free. But similar dresses are wom by male figures as weil in Syrian iconography (cf. Moortgat, 1940:no. 521).
263 The seal was found "on the pavement of a Middle Kingdom palace (13th dynasty stratum G/4 second halfofthe 18th c. BC)" (Dijkstra, 1991:127).

Figure81
Figure 81 is found on a cylinder seal in the Louvre with unknown provenance. lt is made from steatite in the Neo-Assyrian style, and can be dated to the 9th and 8th centuries B.C.264 The scene on the seal depicts a homed snake or dragon with arms lying on the ground with its head raised. From its mouth fire is protruding. On its back in a running position, a god is depicted. Moortgat-Correns comments on the motif of the running god in the NeoAssyrian cult: "Der rasende Laufschritt Ninurtas bei dem Kampf, 'der göttliche Schnell-Lauf, ist wohl der Anlaß zu einem Fest, das man zum Gedenken an seinen Sieg über Anzu in den Tempeln veranstaltet hat, wobei eben dieser Lauf im Mittelpunkt stand" (1988: 126). The god is armed with a sword attached to bis belt and has bis one arm raised in a striking gesture, holding a round object in bis hand.265 With bis other band he is holding a double three-forked bundle of lightning attached to a long staff as bis primary weapon. Behind the god a small figure is suspended in mid-air in a position of adoration. Facing the god a goddess is standing in front of the snake, also armed with a sword. She is holding a tambourine in her band, extending it toward the god on the snake. In front of her head the seven-star is visible. Crescent and rhombe fill the remaining spaces of the image. As observed above, the god on the snake can be identified as Ninurta fighting the homed snake, while the goddess with the tambourine would be lshtar (cf. Figure 59) which stands in close association to the warrior-god Ninurta (Moortgat-Correns, 1988:127). An interesting aspect of the seal is the fact that Ninurta is standing on the back of the Anzu snake, i.e., the animal he is attacking. One would normally expect him confronting it or standing on the back of his characteristic animal, the dragon, unless one identifies the snake as a poor rendering of the homed dragon on which Ninurta usually is depicted. But the animal clearly appears to be a snake, although it appears that no real confrontation is taking place. Another depiction of the weather-god fighting the homed snake motif shows a very similar scene without the goddess. lt is found on a cylinder seal without known provenance, made from serpentine, now in the

possession of the BIF (Figure 82).266 The seal is clearly NeoAssyrian in style, and can also be dated to the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. The homed snake is lying on the ground with its front raised, while its one front leg is extended
toward the front. From its mouth Figure82 flames are coming forth, and its body is pattemed probably indicating scales. The god on its back is in a running position while a cape attached to his neck is floating in the windstream created by his speed. His one arm is raised above his head, and the object he is holding with his hand appears to be an ax.267 The other hand is brandishing the double three-forked bundle of lightning against the head of the snake. Behind the god, crescent, eightpointed star, and rhombe fill the empty space. Again, the question has to be raised, if the god is fighting the homed snake on which he is running, i.e., which he is attacking from the back, or if both homed snake and god are attacking an imaginary enemy together. A final example which may contribute to the understanding of the motif group is found on a cylinder seal from Tell al-Reinah (Figure 83). Tue seal is made from serpentine or steatite, measuring 18 x 8 mm, and was found in a Late Assyrian shrine (area A, TR. 4423) dating from 800-612 B.C.268 The dragon/snake is depicted in similar fashion as in Figure 81 and Figure 82, i.e., snake-like body and head, but two front legs, except for the fact that its tail is curled up, and the god is not standing or running on its back. Above the tail an eight-pointed star is visible. Behind the snake a bearded god is visible in a standing (not in a running) position. He is wearing a lang dress and is· one hand is raised above his head, although no weapon is visible. The other hand is extended toward the front and he is brandishing three shafts of lightning against the snake. From this depiction we would assume that the god is attacking the animal from the back which would elucidate the two preceding images. Although there Figure 83
266 The seal was published by Teissier (1984:168, fig. 224). No measurements are given.
267 The unidentified object in Ninurta's hand in Figure 81 should be interpreted along the same line. 268 The seal was published by Parker (1975:38, no. 55, pi. 16:55).



252 5. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
are certain differences in the depiction of the motif69 we would assume that the same iconographic theme, i.e., the fight of Ninurta against Anzu is depicted, and that the god can be portrayed as attacking from behind, viz., from behind in the running position on the back of the snake-dragon. However, as to the identification ofthe god, a question mark has to remain. While the warrior-god Ninurta is usually depicted in the context ofthe fight against the dragon, the bundle of lightning identify the gods on our three examples of that motif group as weather-gods for which Adad would be a more likely option. However, the affinity between Ninurta and Adad has been noted before. Moortgat-Correns comments with regard to the interchangeability of the two gods: "Kommen sie [Ninurta and Adad] aber getrennt vor und ohne ihre Tiere, sind sie nicht zu unterscheiden: Beide können eine Axt und einen Blitz halten, beide sind mit Pfeil und Bogen ausgerüstet und beide gleich gekleidet: man könnte geradezu an Zwillinge denken" (1988: 128).270

Figure 84 can be found on a limestone stela from Babylon which in accordance with its archaeological context can be dated from 823-811 B.C.271 The design bears distinct traces of the Neo-Babylonian style, as is demonstrated in the intricately modeled dress (cf. Collon, 1987:168, no. 785; 1990:no. 21).272 On the left of the scene a goddess is standing on a stylized mountain, facing to the right. She is wearing the high feathered crown, and an intricately ornamented dress reminiscent of shields with a belt around her waist. Her hair falls down on her neck, and there is a long curl (or streamer) on the side of her face. The goddess has raised her one

27° Cf. our remarks to the cylinder seal shown in Figure 21 on which an inscription can be
found which includes the Old Assyrian MAS for which the meaning 'twin ' is attested (Hirsch apudMoortgat-Correns, 1988:129).
271 Tue stela has been published by Ward (1910:fig. 1273; cf. Contenau, 1931:1302-1302, fig. 823; and Pritchard, 1969b:313f., no. 533), and was found in the partly excavated Central Palace ofNebuchadnezzar II.
272 Comments Ward (1910:fig. 1273) on the circumstances of the find: "Among the monuments discovered by the German expedition to Babylon in 1899, was a limestone stele (fig. 1273), with four figures in bas-relief and a long inscription of Shamash-reshusur, Viceroy of Suhi and Maer.... This stele was probably carried by Nebuchadnezar, or some king of his dynasty, to Babylon as a trophy of victory, just as the stele with the Hammurabi Code was carried from Sippara to Susa by a Median conqueror. The land of Suhi was on the Middle-Euphrates, somewhere about the mouth of the river Habor". Ward assigns a date in the middle ofthe 8th century to the stela, but the context in which the object was found in Babylon requires the date given by Contenau (1931: 1302f.).

band in a gesture of blessing, while the other band is extended toward the front, holding the tip of a bow and a ring. Above the bow an eight-pointed star is visible which distinguishes the bow as a divine weapon. In front of her face, the marru spade of Marduk and (possibly) the qan tuppi stylus of Nabu are visible. The male god is also standing on a stylized
mountain in a similar posture as Figure84 the goddess, facing to the right. The dress is identical tö the one the female deity is wearing. He has a high feathered crown on his head and is sporting a lang beard. He is holding a bundle of lightning in both hands which is of the double-forked type with the two prongs in a zigzag design.273 One band is in front of the body with a round object around the wrist, while the other band is extended toward the front, also holding a ring together with the bundle of lightning. In front of the god a bearded worshipper is standing facing him. He is depicted in a lower position and proportionally smaller than the gods. He is dressed like an Assyrian king with a rectangular crown on which a globe is visible. His dress is not ornamented except for a striped border at the bottom. He is wearing a shoulder strap and a broad belt. His one band is raised toward the god in a gesture of adoration, while the other band is holding an oblong staff-like object which can be identified as a scepter, designating the figure as a royal adorant. Behind ~e worshipper another god is visible, also standing on a stylized mountain, but unfortunately, the top part of the figure has been damaged so that an identification is not possible. Above the worshipper, a crescent and (possibly) a winged sundisk are visible. The inscription next to the image seems to correspond with the depiction and identifies the deities as the weather-god Adad and Ishtar, while the adorant most probably portrays Shamash-resh-usur, the governor of Suhi, a region between the Babylonian and Assyrian domains which accounts for the presence of both Assyrian and Babylonian influences in the scene. A similar scene is found on a votive cylinder seal from Beer-Sheba. lt is made from chalcedony, measuring 38,3 x 15,4 mm (Figure 85). "Tue cylinder was found in the debris of Street 844 together with other votive objects" (Beck, 1973:56), and can thus only be dated in accordance with

comparative material which would locate the seal at the end of the 8th
century B.C. and 7'h century B.C.274 The incision technique seems to be somewhat exceptional, since it depicts various aspects of the scene in an outlined style and not in the normally expected bas relief technique commonly found on NeoAssyrian cylinder seals.275 The god depicted on the right side of the scene is wearing a high feathered crown which is the "typical headdress of the Kassite gods of Babylonia, known from the kudurru of the second half of the second millennium B.C.E." (Beck, 1973:56). From this time onwards it is the standard headgear ofthe Babylonian and Assyrian gods (cf. Figure 84) and designates them as such, although heroes and mythological creatures can also wear similar crowns. The hairstyle is long and the end of the hair-do is indicated by two vertical lines behind the back of the god. The long dress of the god is omamented with a pattem of vertically inserted curved lines which resemble four triple-edged semi-circles, probably reminiscent of the shield decoration found on the divine dresses in Figure 84.276 The god is standing on a rectangular podium which is decorated with curved lines, probably an indication for a water-design, although the depiction is too schematic to be certain about this detail. His one hand is raised in a gesture of blessing, while the other is extended toward the front holding a long stick and a bundle of double-forked lightning, whereas the lightning does not necessarily seem to be attached to the staff.277 The stela from Babylon discussed above shows a god with a similar staff on the right side of the

275 Comments Beck: "This particular linear style is not found in any of the group-styles of the cylinder seals. In the Neo-Assyrian Linear Style of the ninth-eighth century, the figures are executed in low relief and certain details are incised. lt would, therefore, seem that from the point of view of its technique, the Beer-sheba seal is an exception" (1973:56).
276 Beck mentions a number of objects on which the dress decorations are similar to the one on the cylinder seal, but can clearly be identified as round shields, sometimes suspended on bands (1973:57).
277 If one examines the photograph, one can realize that the bundle of lightning which is visible and the stick are slightly out of line with each other.

scene, although unfortunately the top part of the figure is broken off. A worshipper is standing on the ground facing the god. His lang dress is not decorated except for a striped border at the bottom. He is wearing shoulder straps and a broad belt. On his head a high oval headdress can be seen.278 Both his hands are extended toward the front in the familiar gestures of adoration (cf. e.g., Figure 26). His lang hairdress is also terminated with two vertical lines. Behind the bearded worshipper similar lines as found on the podium are visible.279 lt is interesting to note that there are no divine or celestial symbols filling the open spaces between and around the two figures. The cylinder seal has an inscription which is incised in the positive which points to the fact that the seal was used a votive cylinder.280 Following Rainey' s transcription and translation (1973:61 ), the cuneiform inscription reads as follows:
1) a-na dAp~i)l(A) - dAdda (ISKUR) bei~ (EN) rabi (GAL) 2) be!-li-su Ri-mut-iläni ~DINGIR.MES) 3) mär(DUMU) IdAdad(ISKUR)-id-ri 4)1pus(DÜ)-ma iq1s (BA-is)
1) To Ap(i)l-Addu, the great lord 2) his lord, Rimüt-iläni, 3) son of(H)adad-0idri 4) made and donated (this cylinder seal)
While the inscription is constructed in the normal pattem of votive objects, the recipient of the gift is a less familiar deity, i.e., Ap(i)l-Addu which occurs as a theophoric element in Assyrian personal names (Rainey, 1973:61). Mention of this god is also made on the inscription found in the context of the stela from Babylon, viz., originally Suhi, and the deity may have been revered in this region along the middle Euphrate~. As a whole the votive cylinder from Beer-Sheba exhibits a number of affinities to the stela from Babylon so that one would suspect a common background ofthe two objects, while the god depicted on the cylinder seal may be identified as the weather-god Adad or its local middle-Euphratian variation Ap(i)lAddu. lt stands to question, how this object came to the southem Judean desert, and probably has to be examined along the lines of the Assyrian administrative and military dominion in that region during the 8th century B.C. lt certainly cannot be considered to be the product of a local glyptic workshop, but seems to have been imported.
278 Fora similar headdress, cf. Pritchard (196%:447) showing two royal captives ofwhich one wears a similar crown. Cf. especially the priest in Figure 21. 279 Maybe the seal cutter originally planned the depiction of another god in that space.

Figure86
As a final example of the armed gods motif group a cylinder seal impression from Nippur in the Neo-Assyrian style can be seen (Figure 86). The impression is quite large measuring about 70 mm in height.281 The date of the object has originally been assigned to the 13th century B.C., but the Neo-Assyrian style of the image282 and the context of Esarhaddon's vassal treaties would rather point to a date in the 8th century B.C.283 The inscription around the image is mainly illegible and only the name of the Assyrian deity Asshur can be made out with certainty (Wiseman, 1958b: 19). The scene presented on the impression shows a worship scene with an initiation context. To the left a god is standing in a passant position on the back of a crouching gazelle. He is wearing a long dress which opens in the front revealing a knee-long skirt. The head is depicted in the typical Assyrian divine fashion with a high horned crown, a long plaited beard, and the hair reaching down to the neck. His one arm is hanging downwards holding an ax in a vertical position, while the other arm is extended toward the figure facing him, holding ring and rod with his band. In front of him a male bearded figure is standing on the ground. His horned crown is different in that it is rounded at the top. Dressed in like manner as the god, he has no weapons or further attributes, and his one arm is pointing toward the back as if to introduce the person
281 The impression has been published by Wiseman (1958b:19-22, fig. 6; cf. Collon, 1987:134, no. 560).
282 Our line drawing is a reconstruction of the seal, since no complete impression was found, but the various fragmented impressions allowed for a complete reconstruction.
283 The seal impression was found on the th century vassal treaties of Esarhaddon: "Early
in the th century BC Esarhaddon of Assyria had vassal treaties drawn up to ensure the succession ofhis sons to the thrones of Assyria and Babylon. These treaties were written out on huge tablets on which were rolled three cylinder seals of different dates.... Recent studies have demonstrated convincingly that these are the seals of the god Assur which were kept not, as one would expect, in the temple but in the City Hall at Ashur and then in an annex of the later Nabu temple at Nimrud (presumably they were later moved to Nineveh)" (Collon, 1987:131). Moortgat-Correns comments on the erroneous original dating ofthe seal impression: " ... wenn der kniende König nicht wäre, der wegen seiner Haltung entfernt an Tukulti-Ninurta I. auf seinem Symbolsockel erinnert, wäre niemand je auf die Idee gekommen, daß es sich um ein Siegel mittelassyrischer Zeit handeln würde. Die hohen, nach oben hin leicht ausladenden Hüte der beiden Götter ... sind typisch seit der zweiten Hälfte des 8. Jhs., und die Haltung der Hände des Königs ist ebenfalls neuassyrisch..." (1988:117, n. 3).

kneeling behind him. The kneeling male bearded figure is bareheaded with a long dress and his hands are in the typical gesture of adoration with the pointing thumb on the one hand, and the open palm on the other. Behind him another god is standing on a homed winged bull. He is depicted in like manner as the first god, but holds in one hand a rod or scepter, while the other is holding a crosswise double-forked bundle of lightning. We would suggest that the scene represents the introduction of an Assyrian prince or royal dignitary (the kneeling figure) by the king (the standing figure without any divine attributes) to the gods Adad (with ax, ring and rod) and the weather-god Ninurta (with the bundle of lightning) (Moortgat-Correns, 1988:118, n. 3),284 although one also could opt for the reversed identification. The motif of the weather-god in arms has primarily been represented by Assyrian motifs depicting Adad viz., local adaptations of that deity. The bundle of lightning, again, has been the demarcating criterion for the inclusion in the motif group, while all three images present scenes with a passive connotation, i.e., the meteorological weapon is not used to attack an enemy, but rather held in an emblematic manner.
5.2.4.6. The God in the Winged Sundiskwith the Bow
A variation of the motif already discussed under the class displaying god of heaven attributes, represents the god in the winged sundisk with a bow, adding the warrior aspect to the imagery. The relief on the famous 'broken obelisk' from Niniveh shows a personification of the winged sundisk, although no deity is visible on the scene (Figure 87). The image is about 30 cm in height, and has tobe dated to the 10th century B.C.285 The scene shows the Assyrian king (?)286 holding ring and rod in one hand, while the other is open in a gesture of receiving
284 Collon has interpreted the scene as the "kneeling king being introduced by a minor god to Assur (?) while Adad looks on" (1987:134). However, the standing person does not display any divine attributes (neither characteristic animal nor weapons) except perhaps for his crown which is, however, clearly differentiated from the crowns ofthe gods, and is more likely to be a royal crown, although homs are visible which normally would indicate a deity (cf. Collon, 1987:134, no. 561). Wiseman (1958b:21) understands the seal to have belonged originally to the Kassite king Sagarakti-Suria~ (1245-1233 B.C.). lt was then captured by Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243-1207 B.C.) and re-cut for Assyrian purposes, but there is little evidence for such a process on the seal impression and the style appears rather homogenous and the scene well-balanced (cf. Collon, 1987:134).
285 The obelisk is housed in the British Museum (BM 118898) and has been published inter alia in Pritchard (1969b:300, no. 440).
286 Unfortunately, his face has been chipped off, not allowing for a closer identification of the figure.

adoration. In front of him four enemies are visible in a submissive posture, having raised their hands in a gesture of adoration. They have a ring through their nose to which a rope is attached which is held by the king. However, the most interesting aspect of the image is the top part of the scene. Above the captives a winged sundisk is visible of which a more detailed
Figure 87 drawing is provided in Figure 88.287 The disk is not very prominent and surrounded by a tightly feathered pair of wings which almost appear as one closed semi-circle of wings. An inner and an outer row of feathers are visible. From the wings two hands are coming forth, one holding a bow as ifto band the weapon to the king,288 while the other is extended with an open palm toward the king in a blessing gesture. Frankfort interprets the image as follows: "The original conception as expressed on the 'broken obelisk' is clearly this, that the god appears in the sky and extends his protection to the king. If we wish to explain the feathery mass concretely we might regard it as a rendering of clouds" (1939:211). Although there is no deity visible, the anthropomorphization of the winged sundisk is indicated by the two hands offering the bow the king. Comments Mayer-Opificius: "Es wird hier zum ersten Mal im assyrischen

scheibe deutlich" (1984: 199, cf. figs. 22-23). The god represented by the image is the Assyrian solar deity Samas, and not Asshur.289 In presenting the bow to the king he is
287 Unfortunately, the line-drawing provided by Keel (1972:196, fig. 297) is not very detailed with regard to the depiction ofthe sundisk. 288 Together with the bow the hand is possibly holding an arrow.
289 Asshur used to be the prime candidate for the interpretation of the god in the sundisk. E.g. Keel wrote in 1972 in commenting on the 'broken obelisk': "Den Bogen, den Assur als Gewitter- und Kriegsgott führt, überreicht er ... dem König. Die Inschrift erklärt, daß Assur und andere Götter 'ihre gewaltigen Waffen und ihren erhabenen Bogen seiner Herrscherhand' geschenkt hätten" (1972:197). However, the god has to be understood rather along the lines of a solar deity which would be found in Samas (Mayer-Opificius, 1984:199; cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:338).



5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 259
aiding the monarch in warfare and the conquest of his enemies, thus transferring his military power to the ruler. A more anthropomorphized variant of the motif can be found on a bronze disk with unknown provenance of which only the center image has been reproduced in the line drawing of Figure 89.290 The bronze disk measures about 28 cm in diameter, and can be dated to the 9th century B.C. Before we describe the centerpiece which is of interest for the present motif group, the composition ofthe outer circle should be mentioned. Depicted on it are war scenes consisting of the following motifs:
Die Kampfszenen bestehen jeweils aus zwei angreifenden Streitwagen und einem fliehenden, in Auflösung befindlichen feindlichen Wagen dazwischen; in den beiden etwas größeren oberen Zonenabschnitten flieht ein Reiterpaar auf den bildtrennenden Baum zu; in den unteren Abschnitten läuft die Kampfhandlung auf je einen stehenden Mann zu, dessen Helm einmal von einem Pfeil durchbohrt ist und dessen Hand flehend erhoben ist... (Calmeyer and Seid!, 1983:105f.).
The design is mostly Assyrian but exhibits also Urartian elements, e.g., the form of the chariots and the dress of their drivers which would indicate the presence of a depiction of a Urartian war scene (Calmeyer and Seidl, 1983:106f.). The center image consists of three figures: two atlants are kneeling on stylized mountains supporting the wings of a sundisk from which the upper body of a male god is emerging. Below the sundisk the bird's tail and the god's lower body are visible. He is standing on a pedestal which is, in like fashion as the mountains, pattemed with a scale-design. The supporting figures are wearing homed crowns identifying them as divine or semi-divine beings. The figure is wearing a homed crown which is Urartian in design (Calmeyer and Seidl, 1984:108), and a long dress with a pattemed border which seems to be wrapped around the figure. Tue god is holding a bow in front of him, while the other hand is raised and extended toward the front in a blessing gesture. The connection of the sundisk with the god with a bow appears to identify him as a solar deity with military
connotations which is especially Figure89
290 Allegedly the object stems from Eastern Anatolia, but the style is in tune with Assyrian . workmanship of the 9th century B.C. The disk has been published by Calmeyer and Seid! (1983:1103-114).



260 5. GOD AS WARRJOR AND AS GOD OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY
apparent from the association ofthe motif with scenes of war and victory.291 lt may appear too simplistic to identify the god with Samas, taking the Urartian context and the added context into consideration, but a similar deity with solar connotations is to be expected (Calmeyer and Seidl, 1983:114). A more active and aggressive depiction of the motif is found on the wellknown glazed tile from Assur (Figure 90), measuring 28 x 46 x 8 cm, found in the Anu-Adad-Temple, dating to the time of Tikulti-Ninurta II. (890-884 B.C.).292 The sundisk is depicted as encompassing the winged god completely, while there are rays or flames of fire depicted within the sun nimbus. The bearded god has a large feathered tail and a pair of large wings which go beyond the border of the sundisk. He is wearing a beard and a rounded crown. With his hand the god is holding a bow which he has stretched to its limits, pointing at an imaginary or at least not visible enemy, since the scene has been broken off on the right side. Below a chariot scene is visible of which only the head of the charioteer and the upper part of the horse's head 1s visible. Around the winged sundisk there are stylized clouds with raindrops suspended from the upper border below an inscription.293 The association of the god with rain- clouds Figure 90 demonstrates his identification
291 Comment Callmeyer and Seid!: "Die auf beiden Scheiben [Figure 89 and another similar object] ... dargestellte Szene ist eine Kontamination zweier wohlbekannter Elemente: des 'Mannes in der Flügelsonne' ... und der Flügelsonne (ohne Figur darin); in dieser Form ist sie bisher einzigartig. Erst recht unbekannt war bisher die Verbindung mit einer Siegesdarstellung" (1983:110). However, as Figure 32, a cylinder seal housed in the BIF shows, the motif also appear elsewhere though slightly modified, depicting the sun-god Samas standing on a horse in a similar context. Nevertheless, the additional element is constituted in the association ofthe sun-god with war scenes.
292 The clay tile has been repeatedly published, e.g. Andrae (1923:13, pi. 8; Pritchard, 196%:314, fig. 536; cf. Mayer-Opificius, 1984:fig. 25).
293 Comments Frankfort on the significance of the clouds:. "The rain clouds about the god are not a mere stage-property, or a sudden touch of landscape-painting. They are an essential attribute ofthe god, and remind us ofthe climatic difference between the north and south of Mesopotamia. In Babylonia rain serves at most to supply the nomadic shepherds with pasture, while agriculture is dependent upon irrigation. In Assyria however the country is mostly too hilly for irrigation by canals, and agriculture is dependent upon rain, which is much more plentiful there" (1939:212).



5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS Goo OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 261
with a storm- and weather-deity, while the wide wings symbolize the dark thundering heaven. A rather intricate combination of warrior and god of heaven attributes is present in this scene. While there are definite weathergod connotations like thunder, lightning, rain-clouds, sundisk, etc., the atmospheric phenomena are directed against the enemies of the Assyrian king, thus creating a complex image of the god fighting from heaven with meteorological weapons (cf. Keel, 1972: 196). As for the identification of the winged god in the sundisk, we would follow Mayer-Opificius who has convincingly shown that the god represents Samas rather than Asshur (cf. above n. 125).294 While in Figure 90 the arrow pointed by the god with his bow at the enemies is not visible, Figure 91 shows what kind of a projectile is used in the divine warfare. The depiction is found on a relief from Nimrud from the North-West Palace of Asshurnasirpal II (883-859 B.C.).295 Stylistically it is in line with the preceding specimen, and shows a god with the winged sundisk, whereas the sundisk is depicted as a ring which has been placed over his upper body. The god has a broad feathery tail and is bare-chested. He is wearing a horned crown and a long beard. Behind his back the top part of a quiver is visible. The god is aiming a bow toward the right side at an enemy, while bowstring and arrow are clearly distinguishable. The arrow ends in a three-forked point which resembles a flash of lightning. Thus the arrowshooting sun- and weather-god Samas is using flashes of lightning as his arrows.296 The god with the winged sundisk (viz., the winged god in the Figure 91
294 Comments Mayer-Opificius on the function of Samas: "Aufgrund seines zweiten Aspekts, nämlich dem des Eid- und Rechtsbewahrers, ist Samas darauf bedacht, daß alle Verträge mit Assyrien eingehalten werden. Wenn dies nicht der Fall ist, kann das zu Kriegen führen, die der Sonnengott - auch aus dem zuletztgenannten Aspekt heraus verständlich - unterstützt. So nimmt es nicht wunder, daß der anthropomorph gebildete Samas zusammen mit König Tukulti-Ninurta II., wie man auf dem bereits erwähnten Gemälde [Figure 90] erkennen kann ..., auf die gemeinsamen Feinde schießt" (1984:200).
295 The relief has been published by Budge (1914:pl. 18:1; cf. also Keel, 1972:196, fig. 296).
296 Fora broader context ofthe image, cf. Keel (1972:pl. 20) showing a relieffrom Nimrud on which Samas can be seen above the chariot of the king shooting his arrows into the direction ofthe king's enemies.

The final two examples of the group of objects displaying both warrior and god of heaven attributes, are rather marginal and do not constitute a major iconographic theme in their own right, but nevertheless demonstrate the mixed character ofthis group. Figure 92 is found on relief K from Malatya297 in Anatolia. lt originated from the 'Gate of the Lions' and is ofthe Neo-Hittite style, dating it to the end of the 11th or beginning of the 10th century B.C.298 On the right of the image a libation scene is portrayed, showing the king who is wearing a lang dress and is holding a lang curved stick, as he is pouring water from a small vase into a large vase on the ground. In front of him a god with a high conical homed crown is standing. The god is dressed with a short kilt and a short-sleeved top, while a curved sword (or the sheath of the sword) is attached to his belt.299 His one hand is raised above his head in a striking position, holding a curved short weapon, while the other arm is extended toward the king holding a three-forked bundle of lightning in the form of a 'W' in his hand. Behind the god an inscription in Hittite hieroglyphs indicates the name of the god as Tarhunzas represented by a .dW', which in its shape is reminiscent of the bundle of lightning in the god's hand. The scene is concluded by the depiction of a god standing on a chariot drawn by two bulls. The two gods are portrayed in like fashion, except that the god
Figure 92
on the chariot is holding the reins of the bulls in the hand in which the other god is holding the bundle of lightning. Vanel comments: "La parfaite similitude des deux dieux et le fait que le signe ,dW' est ecrit entre les deux font penser qu'il s'agit d'un seul et meme dieu
297 Not tobe confused with Maltaya where the relief with the procession of Assyrian gods has been found (cf. Figure 74).
298 The relief has been published by Delaporte (1940:pl. 24; cf. also Frankfort, 1969:pl. 133b). A number of elements in the depiction of the scene seem to be more in line with images ofthe 13th century B.C., but overall the given date seems preferable and the 13th century has tobe regarded as a terminus a quo (Vanel, 1965:l 19f.). 299 Cf. the similarity to the god depicted in Figure 77.

represente deux fois. Peut-etre l'artiste a-t-il voulu faire comprendre que le dieu descend de son char ou y remonte avant ou apres la ceremonie de la libation" (1965: 120). The weather-god on the chariot in a warlike appearance is not so much to be seen in the context of actual warfare, but rather as an emblem similar to the bundle of lightning he is holding in the libation scene, nevertheless indicating the warrior connotation of the weather-god. 300 For the last depiction we retum to Egyptianizing iconography, although the object has been manufactured in Palestine. The motifs found on a rectangular plaque from Ta'anach which has been incised on both sides can be seen in Figure 93. The object comes from a Iron Age IIA context and has been dated from 1000-900 B.C.301 The important detail which is of concem for the present study is the human figure depicted on both images. On the left scene the person is sitting on a throne with his hands raised toward the front which indicates royal connotations.302 From his mouth and not from the forehead or crown, where one normally would expect it, an uraeus is emanating. A similar depiction can be seen on the other side of the plaque, where the figure is in a walking position with his hands upwardly extended toward both sides as if to support an object. While it is possible, that we are confronted with a portrayal of the king with solar attributes, the two images more likely represent depictions of the sun-god in two different forms, since the context of the scenes and similar images regularly indicates the presence of a deity rather than that of a human king, although there are certainly overlapping areas in Egyptian royal and divine solar
iconography.303 Consequently: Figure 93
300 "II se pourrait, d'autre part, que Je theme du dieu de l'orage debout sur un animal soit une reduction iconographique de celui du dieu au char" (Vanel, 1965:121). However, to identify the iconographic theme ofthe god on the char with the god on the animal seems to be too simplistic, since the latter is so widely distributed that one would expect a similar distribution for the chariot scene. 301 Cf Keel and Uehlinger (1992:154, fig. 159b).

Der aus dem Mund hervorgehende Uräus schließlich charakterisiert die Erscheinung des Gottes als flammenden Gluthauch. Nicht eindeutig zu beantworten ist die Frage, ob es sich bei der schreitenden Gestalt von Abb. 159b [Figure 93] um dieselbe Gottheit in anderer Position handelt, oder ob hier eine Variante des Nebeneinanders von Hintergrund- und Vordergrundgottheit vorliegt. Die ausgebreiteten Arme erinnern an den königlichen Gestus des Himmelsstützens ...; da das Objekt des Stützens aber fehlt, geht es der Darstellung wohl vornehmlich um die belebende Rolle des Luftgottes. Die beiden Seiten der Platte dürften also die Wirkung des Sonnenlichts als herrscherliche Glut und als belebende Atemluft (vgl. Ps 104,29f.) darstellen (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:154f). The aggressive character of the uraeus emanating from the mouth of the solar deity is, however, noticeable, and it stands to question, if the identical depiction of an iconographic element can symbolize two opposite entities, namely the burning wrath of the deity vs. the life-providing air.
5.2.5. Summary
A short summary of the various motif groups presented during this chapter may be helpful in organizing the source material into a meaningful unit. We have differentiated between three major dasses of objects with their respective motif groups: the dass of objects exhibiting warrior attributes with four motif groups, the objects displaying god of heaven attributes with nine motif groups, and finally the dass of objects with mixed attributes consisting of seven motif groups. (1) The smiting god: This motif group is represented primarily by depictions of the weather- and warrior gods Reshef and Ba'al, viz., the Egyptian Ba'al Seth. Most of the images stem from the end of the Late Bronze Age or beginning of the Iron Age, and are primarily found in the form of figurines and statuettes. The iconographic theme is only revitalized on a !arger scale during the Persian period with the portrayal of Herades as the smiting god. From our selection of ten objects, seven have an ascertained Syro-Palestinian archaeological background. (2) Archer scenes: Gods in connection with archer scenes are predominantly found in the context of the mythological fight against the dragon and the snake. Out of the five objects, three have originated from Syro-Palestinian sites. While only three objects are depicting the mythological fight, we could have added a number of similar objects which were widely distributed in the form of fayence cylinder seals (cf. Figure 15). The majority of these objects are in the form ofNeo-Assyrian cylinder seals. (3) The god with the spear: The god fighting the horned snake with the spear is a particular early motif within our chronological delimitations with all three selected objects stemming from the end ofthe 2nd or the beginning



5. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN INANE ICONOGRAPHY 265
of the 1st millennium. Two out of three objects from Syro-Palestinian and Transjordan sites demonstrate the presence of the motif in this region. (4) The god/dess in arms: This is a more passif motif within the depictions associated with the warrior class of objects. All images are found on NeoAssyrian cylinder seals from the 9th and 8th centuries B.C., illustrating the popularity of this iconographic motif during this period, while only one out of seven objects originated in Syro-Palestine. The Assyrian gods Adad, Ninurta, and Ishtar are the prominent figures on these depictions. (5) The god in the winged sundisk: A time span from the 10th to the 5th century B.C. and a wide distribution characterizes this motif group while the connotations are of a celestial and cosmic nature with solar emphasis, identifying the god in the winged sundisk usually with the sun-god Samas, whereas a tendency toward an increasing anthropomorphization could be observed. Two out of eight objects come from Syro-Palestine. (6) The water-providing god: The water-providing god is usually found in similar contexts as the preceding motif group, i.e., in connection with the winged sundisk. While the image is derived from Middle-Babylonian and Middle-Assyrian times, it is found in Neo-Assyrian glyptic in the form of depictions of the water-god Ea or figures associated with him. There is no Syro-Palestinian representative of this motif group. (7) The sacred palm tree: Although there is only one object from SyroPalestine among this motif group, its presence in the region has been attested elsewhere (cf. Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:170-174). However, with regard to the flowing water, as represented on the majority of the selected images, it has to be ascribed to Assyrian and especially Neo-Assyrian iconography ofthe 9th to the ?'h century B.C. (8) The goddess in the star nimbus: This motif group is limited to depictions of the Neo-Assyrian goddess Ishtar who was closely associated with astral and celestial phenomena during that period. Four out of the seven selected objects come from Syro-Palestinian sites, although the workmanship is usually of a much rougher nature than their Neo-Assyrian counterparts. (9) The celestial throne: This motif group again is restricted to the NeoAssyrian glyptic of the 9th/gth centuries B.C., while there is an interesting association with the 'queen of heaven', viz., 'god of heaven' theme. One variant of the three images comes from 'Amman. (10) The god/dess in creation: Gods or goddesses active in nature, or closely associated with nature are depicted in this group, while various deities (Ea, Adad, Ishtar, or the sun-god) may serve in this capacity. Especially the incised shell from Arad demonstrates the Syro-Palestinian



266 5. Gon AS WARRIOR AND AS Gon OF HEAVEN INANE lCONOGRAPHY
provenance of this motif group and its local interpretation. The objects cover a time period from the 13th to the 7th century B.C. (11) The winged sphinx: The wide distribution of this motif group in SyroPalestine has been attested before (e.g., Keel, 1977a: 18-20; Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:288-290), while the originally Egyptian motif usually either serves as a throne of the deity, or in a more protective posture, as a guard for another object. However, the winged sphinx as a throne for the deity with the deity depicted as sitting on it, is rarely found in the region of Syro-Palestine. Six out of our eight objects stem from Syro-Palestinian sites ranging chronologically from the Iron Age I to the Persian period. (12) The winged god/dess: Depictions of winged goddesses or gods are usually found in Syro-Palestine in Neo-Assyrian administrative centers from the Iron Age IIB (two out of three objects come from Syro-Palestine), i.e., the 8th or 7th century B.C. For the identification of the deity, the male god Ba'al serves as the most possible candidate, while the female winged goddess could be 'Astarte. The image seems to be limited to Northem Israelite and Phoenician workshops. (13) Miscellania (god of heaven attributes): Under this motif group a depiction of an Assyrian cultic practice is found, i.e., the procession of the sun-god on his wagen through the land. The other object shows the famous procession of Neo-Assyrian gods from Maltaya which demonstrates sociomorphic and anthropomorphic realities rather than a comprehensive depiction ofthe Neo-Assyrian pantheon. (14) The smiting god with the vegetation spear: The object representing this motif group is the famous 'Ba'al au foudre' dating from the Late Bronze Age, while his weapon can be identified as a vegetation spear, and not as a flash of lightning. The motif also reiterates the smiting god imagery. (15) The smiting god with the bundle of lightning: The three images associated with this motif group depict weather-gods which can normally be identified with the Neo-Assyrian Adad or local variations of that deity. One object comes from a Northem Syrian site, another from Anatolia, while the third one is without known provenance. (16) The weather-god standing on mountains: The god on mountains in our selection of motifs is chronologically limited to the beginning of the time period under question, while both objects selected for this study exhibit more northem influences, although no provenance is given. There appears tobe no Syro-Palestinian representation of that motif. (17) The weather-god fighting the snake: The group of three Neo-Assyrian cylinder seals dating from the 9th to the ih centuries B.C. is of similar character as the archer scene motif group on which mythological struggles can be seen. All images depict the weather-god Ninurta or Adad fighting



5. Goo AS WARRIOR AND AS GOD OF HEAVEN INANE !CONOGRAPHY 267
the horned snake with the meteorological weapon, i.e., the bundle of lightning. One ofthe objects comes from Syro-Palestine. ( 18) The weather-god in arms: This motif group consists of non-aggressive depictions of gods armed with the bundle of lightning. We have repeatedly established that the most important attribute for the identification of the weather god is the bundle of lightning which almost serves as an emblem and not as a weapon in this group. One of the three Neo-Assyrian cylinder seals, viz., cylinder seal impressions comes from Syro-Palestine, while they can be dated to the 9th/8th centuries B.C. (19) The god in the winged sundisk with the bow: Returning to the motif of the god in the winged sundisk, images depicting armed gods in the sundisk are assembled for this motif group. Both passive and active bow scenes are present, while all four objects come from outside Syro-Palestine, i.e., Mesopotamia, and are dated to the 9th century B.C. (20) Miscellania (warrior and god of heaven attributes): An image of the smiting weather-god with the bundle of lightning standing on a chariot from Anatolia, and the Egyptianizing depiction from Ta'anach showing a god from whose mouth an uraeus comes forth, conclude the selection of objects relevant for the purpose of the present study.

The purpose of this chapter is to bring together the material presented up to now in the form of a comparison between the results of the exegetical (chapter 4) and iconographic (chapter 5) parts of this study. However, before the actual comparison between the two bodies of evidence can take place, it appears to be essential to outline the main issues pertaining to the comparative approach as applied in this study.
6.1. THECOMPARATIVEMETHOD
Methodological considerations regarding the comparative method almost present itself, since the focus of this part lies on a comparative level. Historical research in any discipline has always been permeated by comparative approaches, and the comparative method as applied to ANE studies has to be understood as developed from and influenced by theoretical considerations relevant to other disciplines.1 Comparative methods have been employed by biblical scholars since the institution of ANE research,2 while the focus of comparison has always been the "Old Testament with the cultural remains of the world outside it" (Malul, 1990:4). However, a systematic evaluation of this method and its underlying principles, has only begun to materialize within the last two decades.3 The most concentrated work which has been published unto now
1 Fora summary of relevant literature, see Malul (1990:2, n. 4) and Talmon (1977:321, n. 5; 322, n. 6). lt is, however, important to evaluate the comparative method against the specific requirement of ANE studies, and adapt it, where necessary.
2 Or even earlier: the multi-lingual lists from Mesopotamia clearly reveal comparative endeavours. The Middle Ages and Reformation eras were characterized by an increasing interest in comparative Semitic philology (Malul, 1990:3f.).
3 There have been earlier attempts to address the problem, but these were limited to pilot projects like the following: in 1966 Albright discussed the question of archaeology and historical analogy, and its application to the early biblical tradition. He rightly stated that "analogy is basically the application of the principle of resemblance or comparison" (1966:6), and went on to integrate the, until then, narrow field of "biblical archaeology" into the much broader archaeological context of the whole ANE (1966: 13f.). However, as much as the present state of biblical studies owes to Albright's contribution, his



6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY 269
is Malul's The Comparative Method in Ancient Near Eastern and Biblical Legal Studies (1990), and the present author is indebted to that work, since it summarizes the development of the issue in the course of the last two centuries. Although Malul's perspective comes from the realm of biblical legal studies and his deductions do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the present writer, his work proved to be a valuable resource in discussing the comparative method. Since it is not our purpose to re-write the development of the comparative method, we will often refer to Malul's work in the course of the following paragraphs in which a comparison of Malul' s approach with concepts of other adherents to the comparative method will be attempted.4 The section will be concluded by an evaluation of the comparative method and the endeavor to adapt it to the requirements ofthe present study. lt may be important to clarify the terminology employed in this section: comparative method refers to the method of comparing biblical phenomena with other phenomena that occur in the whole realm of the ANE setting in general.5 The comparisons have to work on the level of cultural systems without isolating individual phenomena from their respective cultural context. These comparisons may take place in different areas, encompassing a variety of approaches which are described below. The underlying principles of the comparative method are based on the assumption that there are common characteristics between societies and cultures, which allow the researcher to make valid comparisons. With that notion it becomes obvious, that the comparative method as applied to biblical studies, finds its origin in the anthropological sciences, and more specifically, as Malul describes it, in "the philosophical d~bate between Diffusionists on the one hand, who explain the similarity of human phenomena as reflecting some underlying historical connection, and the Evolutionists on the other, who explain the similarity as deriving from the
approach was deficient, since he compared individual phenomena occurring in different cultures instead of comparing cultural systems.
4 Besides Malul, other prominent authors discussing the comparative method, are: Finkelstein (1991), Greenspahn (1991), Hallo (1980; 1990; 1991), Machinist (1991), Mettinger (1990), Saggs (1991), Sandmel (1962), Smith (1969), and Talmon (1977).
5 This equation demonstrates a certain bias, namely, setting the Bible, respectively, the OT, versus the rest of the ANE. Malul criticizes this tendency toward a polarization of the OT against the rest of the ancient documents, pointing out the potential dangers of approaching a "subject matter with tendentiousness and a priori [my italics] notions" (1990:Sf.). However, both in his theoretical and practical treatment of the comparative method, or the descriptive and prescriptive part, as he refers to it, Malul later on adheres to this equation himself. The points of reference für the present study correspond to this meaning ofthe term comparative method.



270 6. WARRIOR AND Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE lCONOGRAPHY
unity of the human mind..." (Malul, 1990: 16). Without entering the realm of anthropological discussion, one realizes the affinity of the comparative method to anthropology, and the interrelation between the different sciences. However, in the past, there has been a general tendency to apply the comparative method to biblical studies without a critical evaluation of its axioms and their usefulness for biblical research.6 The interpretation of observed similarities and congruent phenomena between sociological entities, can be structured into two categories: (1) the comparative method on the grand scale7 or the typological comparison; and (2) the historio-geographical comparative method or the historical comparison.8 The development of the comparative method and its subsequent application to biblical studies, has removed the foundation for the isolationist's point of view who regards biblical history as having taken place in a vacuum.9
6.1.1. Typological Comparison
The typological comparison or comparative method on the grand scale is strongly based on the evolutionist assumption of the "fundamental unity of the human spirit" (Bloch apud Talmon, 1977:322), and furthermore, a general uniformity of man and his cultures. lt primarily focuses on comparisons between cultures and societies that are geographically and chronologically far removed from each other. Similar features and phenomena are isolated, and interpreted as indicators for the asserted conformity of human behaviour. As applied to biblical studies, the typological comparison merits the following results.
6 The question of methodological considerations with regard to the comparative method, has already been raised by Talmon: "Scholars seem to be less concemed about scrutinizing their methods in the light ofthe experience gathered from their 'field work' and seldom apply themselves to such basic questions as whether the comparative method intrinsically operates under the 'assumption of uniformity', as one school advocates, or ifthe aim should be 'a comparison of contrasts rather than a comparison of similarities', as another school would have it" (1977:321).
7 This term has been coined by M. Bloch in an anthropological study on the comparative method (1970:41).
8 Both categories are described by Malul (1990:13f.) and Talmon (1977:322-325), although the present study follows the terminology employed by Malul, namely typological comparison and historical comparison.
9 With this remark we are touching on the very core of the debate that surrounds the comparative method as applied to biblical or OT studies. lt is the endeavor of biblical scholars to either demonstrate the uniqueness of the people of Israel in history, or to show that Israel's position among the nations of the ANE was by no means extraordinary.



6. WARRIOR AND Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY 271
A biblical and/or ancient Near Eastem comparative scholar applying the typological approach uses evidence from one culture for illuminating another culture and understanding it better, or for demonstrating certain institutions and underlining certain beliefs and practices (Malul, 1990: 17).
Although maybe legitimate when working within its limitations,10 the typological comparison has features which lend themselves readily to abuse, and numerous criticisms have been adduced toward an uninformed application of it to biblical phenomena. 11 The main criticism which has to be voiced against the typological comparison is the dubiousness of its claimed uniformity of cultures and societies.12 The notion of the historiocultural context is ignored, making it evident that "random comparison without reference to the general structure and profile of the overall scale of values and beliefs of the societies involved, can only mar and distort" (Talmon, 1977:324). To separate a phenomenon from its historical and chronological context, can only lead to erroneous conclusions. Thus the frame of reference for any comparison has to be the cultural system. The typological comparison will be of minor concem for the methodology of the present study, and its application does not appear to be valid for the comparative method employed in this study.
6.1.2. Historical Comparison
The development of ANE archaeology and the accumulation of extrabiblical literature has promoted the scholarly interest in the second category of the comparative method, the historical comparison. One can detect the same interdisciplinary affinities to the anthropological sciences as for the typological comparison (Talmon, 1977:325), although ~he historical comparison seems to have been more suitable for the realm of biblical studies than the typological comparison. The main notion of the historical comparison is the diffusionist assumption of a "historical connection or common tradition between the compared societies" (Malul, 1990:14). As an explanation for this historical
10 Malul limits the relevance of the typological comparison to a mere "intellectual exercise on a theoretical level, carried out for pure heuristic purposes..." (1990: 18).
11 Talmon demonstrates the fallacies of the typological comparison with reference to J. G. Frazer's multi-volume work Folklore in the Old Testament, published in 1918. The size of this work demonstrates the fact that the quantity of detected similarities and agreements between two cultures is proportional to the degree of isolation of these phenomena from their respective cultural and historical context. For further examples of the typological comparison, see Malul (1990: 17f., n. 12).
12 Historically, this approach reflects the impact of the evolutionist theory on the social sciences and also modern critical OT studies in the former part of our century (Talmon, 1977:323).



272 6. WARRIOR AND Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
connection, a degree of influence of one culture upon the other, or a common historical source, could be adduced. In considering these axioms, it becomes apparent, that the historical comparison works within a geographical and chronological framework. Only cultures that share the same cultural context or the same "historical stream",13 based on a geographical and chronological congruity, can be the object of a valid comparison. 14 Interest in the historical comparison during the recent decades was distinctly promoted by the great archaeological discoveries of this century, verifying the notion ofisrael being part ofthe ANE historical stream.15 This extemal data contributed to a wealth of publications which demonstrated parallels between the cultural setting of Israel and that oftheir neighbours. 16 However, this has led a number of scholars to pronounce a cautious note, waming against the <langer of "parallelomania", i.e., the abuse of the historical comparison as an ever-ready tool to solve enigmatic passages.17 These remarks produced a fruitful and still ongoing discussion about the
13 This definition of the comparative method according to the historical comparison follows M. J. Herskovitz (apud Talmon, 1977:326).
14 The relative importance of time and place, has been the subject of an ongoing discussion, and the relevant methodological considerations are far-reaching. Talmon, states as a general criterion that "sources closer to the Old Testament in time take pride of place over considerations of geographic proximity; because of the latter, though, even features observed in relatively late sources may retain traces of earlier common cultural conditions. Thus date appears tobe more important thanplace [his italics]" (1977:325). The validity ofthat statement will concem us below.
15 Says Talmon: "A synoptic view ofthe ever increasing information brought to light from the archives ofUgarit, Nuzu, Mari and the Hittite lands made it exceedingly clear that in the two millennia before the common era the peoples of the ANE indeed lived within a 'historic stream' created and maintained by the geographic-historical continuity which made possible a steady transfer and mutual emulation of civilizational and cultural achievements" ( 1977:326).
16 Immediately the contributions ofW. F. Albright come to mind who "has never ceased to provide startling parallels which have promised to solve old cruces and to open new vistas of interpretation" (Hallo, 1990:2), although few current biblical scholars receive these parallels with the same enthusiasm displayed earlier on.
17 Although Sandmel's study deals primarily with the literature of early rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity, his introduction and definition of the term "parallelomania" are nevertheless equally pertinent to the literature of the OT, and have been taken as such: "We might for our purposes define parallelomania as that extravagance among scholars which first overdoes the supposed similarity in passages and then proceeds to describe source and derivation as if implying literary connection flowing in an inevitable or predetermined direction" (Sandmel, 1962:1). lt would, however, be simplistic, to equate the whole realm of the historical comparison with "parallelomania". lt rather shows the necessity ofa critical evaluation ofthe comparative method.



6. WARRIOR AND GOD OF HEAVEN IN HIE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY 273
validity and the methods involved in the historical comparison as a category of the comparative method. Hallo points out another interesting development which, in his opinion, has contributed to the increasing stimulus for comparative studies. He describes the unsatisfactory state of the documentary hypothesis, and the resulting endeavors to find new approaches to the task of analyzing the biblical text. Furthermore, the present state of the literary-critical study of the Bible "has switched the focus of interpretation to the text as received, normally in its Massoretic shape..." (1990: 1). In contrast to this lamentable state, the work clone along the lines of the comparative method seems to offer more satisfactory results for biblical scholarship, since it provides an empirical model for biblical interpretation.18 The validity of Hallo's observation seems to be supportable, since it captures the general tendencies of modern biblical scholarship accurately. The present study will engage in the application of the comparative method from the perspective of the historical comparison, although not without critically qualifying the methods employed. In order to evaluate the comparative method and adapt it to the present study, it is first necessary to survey the different applications ofthe comparative method.
6.1.3. Application ofthe Comparative Method
The past two decades have produced a more fruitful discussion about a balanced approach to the comparative method, and the waming of parallelomania sounded by S. Sandmel has been reiterated repeatedly by various scholars. What has become apparent is the fact that the comparative method, like any other scientific approach, is not free from the <langer of scholarly bias, i.e., the tendency to use the comparative method selectively or one-directional, in order to substantiate an a priori hypothesis. Theoretically, one could adduce a mere academic interest in the occurrence of a similar phenomenon in two or more different cultural contexts, but the practical test and a survey of comparative literature shows that this idealistic approach is restricted to theory. The notion that there is a comparative method which is objective in its application, has to be challenged from the outset: ... the comparative scholar adduces a parallel phenomenon for a specific purpose either to prove something or to emphasize a certain point. lt could safely be said that this distinction between what may be called "objective" comparative activities on
18 Hallo sounds a similar note when he quotes Kitchen and other scholars who "'are · skeptical of traditional literary-critical methods ... preferring objective comparative data to unverifiable hypotheses"' (Kitchen apudHallo, 1980:3).



274 6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAYEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
the one hand, and "purposeful" activities on the other, holds true only theoretically. In reality every "objective" comparative activity becomes "purposeful" when the comparative scholar puts to the test his newly-formed working hypotheses, rejects or accepts them (Malul, 1990:21f.).19 Having said that, one immediately faces the question of what purpose the comparative method serves, and how this purpose is being reached. Malul has isolated six trends in the application of the comparative method which can serve as a valid summary for our discussion: (1) Proof for a historical connection between the OT and the ANE on the basis of a similar phenomenon or literary work that is being compared.20 (2) The use of extemal comparative material in order to enhance the understanding of enigmatic sources, e.g., the elucidating of OT passages through the help of cognate languages.21
19 Cf. also Greenspahn's editorial introduction to the Essential Papers on Israel and the Ancient Near East, where he refers to the comparative method as a tool in the debate of interest between Jewish and Christian authors: "If much of the impetus for seeking parallels between biblical and ANE cultures is not entirely objective, the response that its practitioners are trying to minimize the Bible's Jewish value also echoes a longstanding Jewish perception of Christian interest in the Bible" (1991 :8). Pardee, in reviewing Hallo's co-edited volume Scripture in Context: Essays on the Comparative Method (1980), adds a more general criticism of the application of the comparative method: "For the problem with the traditional comparative approach is not that it compares, but that it sometimes begins comparing with the distant rather than with the proximate, or that it does not nuance its use of comparisons with distant entities, or that it is selective, choosing only those comparisons which favor a certain thesis" (1985:221).
20 Malul devotes a whole chapter to the nature and type of the connection between the OT and the ANE: as to the nature of the connection, he distinguishes between the literary/written level [e.g., borrowing from some literary source] and the reality level [i.e., occurrence of a historical connection, because the biblical writer was part of the general culture of the ANE], although the two are not mutually exclusive, and rather complement each other. The type of connection can be on a variety of levels: (1) a direct connection; (2) a mediated connection, i.e., source A borrows indirectly from source C via source B; (3) a common source; and (4) common tradition (1990:87-91). lt seems, however, inconsistent with his otherwise balanced approach, when Malul comes to the conclusion with respect to the direction of borrowing in case of a direct connection that "the chronological precedence of the ancient Near Eastern sources automatically determines them as the contributor, and the Old Testament as the borrower" (1990:89f.). This presumed automatic direction of borrowing will concern us below during the evaluative remarks on the comparative method.
21 This seems tobe by far the most common purpose for the application ofthe comparative method, and scholars like M. Dahood come readily to mind, who has used (and sometimes abused) this method with regard to the Ugaritic evidence in comparison to the OT. For more detailed examples of comparative literature ofthis category, see Malul (1990:23-25) and Talmon (1977:329-332).



6. WARRIOR AND GOD OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY 27 5
(3) Especially in connection with the Patriarchal traditions, the trend of proving the biblical material on the basis of comparative extemal evidence, has become apparent.22 (4) The use of comparative material in aid of dating the biblical evidence. This trend also applies specifically to the Patriarchal traditions.23 (5) The trend of using the comparative method in order to indicate the contrasts and differences between the OT and the ANE. In contrasting the different cultures with each other, the uniqueness of one source - usually the OT- is emphasized. This trend will especially concem us below.24 (6) As a last use of the comparative method, we can refer to the above mentioned <langer of parallelomania. Numerous comparisons are listed without further qualification as to how the scholar has arrived at the conclusion of similarity, and why he adduces this particular comparison at a11.2s All these trends have in common that they are "based on the a priori [my italics] assumption of a historical connection or a common tradition between the Old Testament and the outside world" (Malul, 1990:25). This assumption is, of course, justified and can easily be demonstrated on the basis of historical data. However, if one surveys the abundant literature that employs the comparative method, one realizes that there is a lack of "clearly defined and objective criteria for its application and for a judicious explanation of the parallelisms, their meanings and implications" (Malul, 1990:35). After having discussed the underlying theoretical assumptions pertinent to the comparative method, it seems to be appropriate to consider the practical approaches of this method, i.e., the way the comparative student goes about his task.
22 This trend has also been promoted in the form of a negative proof, as an argumentio e silentu, i.e., if there is no extemal evidence which contradicts the Patriarchal narratives, then they can be accepted as historically valid. 23 Cf. Millard (1980:43-58).
24 Cf. the article of P. Machinist who discusses the history of the distinctiveness-of-Israel discussion and examines the biblical distinctiveness passages (1991:421-427). Malul distinguishes two groups of scholars who follow this trend: (1) the fundamentalists/pseudorthodox, mainly for apologetic purposes; and (2) scholars who point out contrasts and differences between Israel and its neighbours working from the assumption ofa common cultural context ofthe ANE ofwhich Israel was part.
25 This approach seems rather futile, since it limits itself to the tedious task of cataloging similarities; Malul refers to it also as "inventorial approach" or "parallel hunting" (1990:32, n. 22).



276 6. WARRIORANDÜODOFHEAVENINTHEPSALMSANDANE ICONOGRAPHY
6.1.3.1. Comparative Approach
This has been the most widely used approach to the comparative method. Nevertheless, it has also drawn the strongest criticism throughout the history of its application.26 The comparative approach to the comparative method according to our definition stresses the parallels and similarities found between two or more different sources. The motivation behind this comparison might be manifold, and a number of uses and misuses have been discussed above, but it has to be pointed out that this approach in itself does not automatically lead to a misapplication, and only the unqualified use of it can lead to misrepresentations. Ideally, comparisons will take place in the form of an equation, i.e., a certain epigraphic or non-epigraphic phenomenon in any one of the cultures of the ANE, is compared with a similar or parallel phenomenon in another culture.27 However, in the realm of biblical studies, the bias toward Israelite culture on the one side of the equation, over against the rest of the ANE on the other side, seems to be appropriate, since it is the main focus for the biblical scholar.
26 Malul mentions various criticisms which can be summarized as follows: (1) the comparative scholar often readily tums to extra-biblical material without first exhausting the intemal biblical evidence. This criticism has especially been adduced by S. Talmon (1977) who differentiates between an atomistic and a holistic approach, whereas atomistic would refer to the tendency to isolate phenomena from their immediate and wider cultural, i.e., biblical, context and compare them with similar phenomena of the extemal source (1977:329). In contrast, a holistic approach would first try to understand the biblical phenomenon in its immediate and wider biblical contexts, its Sitz im Leben. (2) The notion of comparative scholars to set the biblical culture in contrast with the cultures of its surrounding neighbours, in order to underline the uniqueness of Israel in the ANE. This criticism actually applies to the contrastive approach (see below). (3) The reconstruction of enigmatic phenomena in the OT on the basis of extemal theoretical models; underlying this misuse of the comparative method is a uniformalism that often cannot be substantiated by the extemal data. (4) Reconstruction of similarities in order to make a biblical phenomenon conform to the extemal source. (5) The comparison of incomparables, e.g., comparing a biblical text of one genre with extra-biblical texts of a different genre. (6) The dating of biblical traditions on the basis of extra-biblical material which originates from a different age. lt has to be pointed out that these criticisms do not only apply to the comparative approach but also to the contrastive and contextual approaches which are described below.
27 The almost legendary lectures ofF. Delitzsch in 1902 entitled Babel und Bibel can serve as a good illustration of the comparative method and also to a certain extent of the misapplication of the method. Finkelstein has reviewed the evidence adduced by Delitzsch, and has produced a more moderate comparative study on the Hebrew and Babylonian religious mind (1991 :355-380, esp. 356-358).

Parallels can be adduced on various levels, including similarities of literary or stylistic devices, e.g., genre, metaphor,28 imagery, but also similarities on a merely lexicographic and grammatical level. Another, broader, category of comparison may be similarities of customs, ideas, symbolic acts, etc. One realizes that the limitations for the application of the comparative approach are not easily defined, which serves as an explanation as to why its misuse is so abundant. The problem does not seem to lie with the specific parallel, but rather with an over-emphasis of parallels29 and the lack of clearly defined criteria for the application of the comparative approach.
6.1.3.2. Contrastive Approach
The contrastive approach to the comparative method centers around the differences and contrasts between the cultures of the ANE on the one hand, and the biblical OT culture on the other. lt can be seen as a complementary development to the comparative approach30 and is based on the notion that "a comparative approach that is truly objective must be broad enough to embrace the possibility of a negative comparison, i.e., a contrast" (Hallo, 1991:314). Contrasts may be used to illuminate an unfamiliar biblical phenomenon in the same way as a comparative parallel may enhance the understanding ofthat phenomenon.31
28 This is, of course, of special concem for the present study. Says Hallo: "Biblical literature is rich in metaphor. But the precise import of its graphic allusions can sometimes be recovered only in the light of the comparative data, both textual and artifactual" (1990:7).
29 Scholars, "such as H. W. F. Saggs and Morton Smith, who see its [Israel's] ideas as typical of the ancient Near East" (Greenspahn, 1991 :9), will readily characterize the culture oflsrael as representative for its historical and geographical context.
30 Hallo who strongly advocated the contrastive approach, describes its development from the comparative approach: "...scholars such as Yehezkel Kaufmann and Frank Cross have always preferred the contrastive method, and I [W. W. Hallo] have myself long argued for a 'contrastive approach', that is to say, for the need to modify the strictly comparative approach by paying equal attention to possible contrasts between biblical phenomena and their Near Eastem counterparts, whether in the realm of institutions or literary formulations" (1990:2). Cf. also Saggs who opts for an abolishment of the biased toward Israelite religion in comparative studies (1978: 1-29).
31 As a representative study for the contrastive approach, Hallo's discussion of lsrael's cultic calendar may be taken: "My thesis in brief is this: the cultic calendar of ancient Mesopotamia, like its civil calendar, was largely tied to the phases ofthe moon, and not at all to the week (or: a week); in Israel, the cultic calendar was only minimally connected to lunar phases, whereas the sabbatical cycle was all-important" (1991:315). He comes to some interesting conclusions: " ... the uniquely biblical conception of the week and the sabbatical cycle stands out equally by virtue of its pervasiveness in biblical laws and letters, as by its absence from the surrounding Near East" (1991 :325). His final note is even more far-reaching: "Here, then, two of the great contrasts between biblical



278 6. WARRIOR AND Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
An issue closely related to the contrastive approach is the question of the distinctiveness or uniqueness of the nation of Israel against the remaining nations of the ANE. Since the contrastive approach to the comparative method in the realm of biblical studies stresses the distinctiveness of a biblical institution against its Near Eastem counterparts, the contrastive approach has been charged with being the vehicle of "pseudorthodox" (Smith, 1969:32ff.) tendencies, trying to substantiate the superiority of ancient Israelite culture. Again, the problem is not directly dependent on the contrastive approach in itself, but on the deductions that are made on the basis of the contrasts.32
6.1.3.3. Contextual Approach
Out of the apparent dialectic dichotomy between comparative and contrastive approach, W. W. Hallo advanced as a synthesis the contextual approach, which embraces both parallels and contrasts in the comparison of ANE sources. The intention of the contextual approach is "not to repudiate the comparative approach, but to define it, refine it and broaden it, notably by wedding it to the 'contrastive approach"' (1980:2). Since the contrastive approach assumes the above discussed historical connection of Israel' s cultural heritage with the remainder of the ANE cultures, it operates from this background, pointing out the differences and similarities between the compatible sources. Compatibility is defined on literary grounds as "including the entire Near Eastem literary milieu to the extent that it can be argued to have had any conceivable impact on the biblical formulation" (Hallo, 1980:2).33 Mention should be made of S. Talmon's discussion of the comparative method in which he strongly argues for a contextual approach, or in his terminology a holistic approach, but from an interesting perspective. He
Israel and its Near Eastem matrix meet: sabbatical cycles versus lunar calendars, and divine versus royal authority" (1990:326).
32 The notion of uniqueness cannot be excluded a priori, but before one arrives at such a conclusion, certain criteria have to be met: "One has first to prove the possibility of influence or connection [his italics], and only then may he proceed to check the significance of the similarities and differences on the basis of the test for coincidence versus [his italics] uniqueness" (Malul, 1990:97).
33 Recently Hallo broadened the criteria in adding the historical context to the literary context. He furthermore identified the purpose of the contextual approach: "lt is not to find the key to every biblical phenomenon in some ancient Near Eastern precedent, but rather to silhouette the biblical text against its wider literary and cultural environment and thus to arrive at a proper assessment of the extent to which the biblical evidence reflects that environment or, on the contrary, is distinctive and innovative over against it" (1990:3).



6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY 279
stresses the importance of first comparing the biblical phenomenon under question within the immediate and wider biblical context. Only when this procedure has not yielded satisfactory results, the should biblical scholar turn to extra-biblical material for the illumination of the source.34 With this line of argument, Talmon creates what one could call a hierarchy of comparison in which the biblical text always precedes any other source.35 To summarize: the appropriate execution of the contrastive method seems to be ensured when the relationship between parallel and contrast is balanced; then a valid overall context for the biblical text can be provided (Hallo, 1990:3).
6.1.4. Evaluation ofthe Comparative Method
In the course of the foregoing discussion it has become obvious that the comparative method is by no means an altogether objective tool with which the biblical scholar can impartially unlock the enigmas of the biblical text.36 Very often the application of the comparative method reveals much about the scholar's personal presuppositions, and, what was intended to be a method of research, sometimes tums out to be a more or less academic confession of faith.37 Tue present writer does not want to exclude himself
34 Concludes Talmon: "Tue interpretation ofbiblical features - whether ofa socio-political, cultic, general-cultural or literary nature - with the help of inner-biblical parallels should always precede the comparison with extra-biblical materials. In the evaluation of a social phenomenon, attention should be paid to its function in the developing structure of the Israelite body politic before one engages in the comparisons with parallel phenomena in other societies" (1977:356). However, since there is only a limited amount of data to be gleaned from the biblical texts, the recourse to extra-biblical material offers itself readily, thus enabling the researcher to understand how certain ideas were received in differing cultures.
35 In this respect Talmon has been criticized by Malul: ''., .. Talmon's approach echoes the invalid assumption that the biblical corpus is a monolithic and unified work from the point of view of both its language and lexicon, as weil as the ideologies and views reflected in it, so that one may freely resort to any biblical evidence from any genre or period for the elucidation of problems existing in other genres and periods" (1990:46). Tue validity of this criticism, however, may be proportional to the scholar's personal view ofthe unity ofthe biblical literature.
36 Says Greenspahn in his introduction to the Essential Papers on Israel and the Ancient Near East: "Whether couched in religious, philosophical, or even social scientific terms, therefore, the issues discussed in the essays collected here are not simply academic.... As we have seen, the vested interests ofboth Christians and Jews are at stake in many ofthe esoteric arguments on these seemingly pedantic points. Nor are their authors entirely disinterested parties, even if the debates are sometimes cloaked in the rhetoric of archeology or linguistics and defended on the basis of supposedly objective, 'external' evidence" (1991:10). 37 This refers to scholars from all schools ofthought.



280 6. WARRIOR AND ÜOD OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
from that tendency, but it seems to be important to notice the impact a personal point of view has on the course of the research. This is by no means to say that the comparative method should be abandoned or be classified as an academic entertainment, since it still holds true that "much of the most exciting work in the field [of modern biblical scholarship] has been derived from outside its own immediate limits, i.e., from the juxtaposition of the biblical text with other literature and with the epigraphic discoveries made both on the soil of the Holy Land and throughout the Near East" (Hallo, 1990:1). Nevertheless, it appears tobe appropriate to clarify some aspects of the comparative method that are pertinent for the present study in an evaluative manner. (1) The motivation of the comparative approach to this study is the attempt to understand a certain type of biblical language, i.e., metaphorical language, in the context of the biblical text itself and also against its ANE background. With that it is said that the culture of Israel is understood as being an integral part of the ANE, a member of its "historical stream".38 (2) The point of departure for the comparative procedure is the biblical text, but the equation of comparison has to be recognized as being bidirectional,39 i.e., the notion of a reciprocal influence of biblical and extrabiblical sources cannot be excluded a priori.40 This would correspond to the concept of applying the same standards to the biblical text as to the rest of the ANE documents.41 (3) The nature of comparison can be both comparative and contrastive, comprising similarities as well as differences which brings us to the question of the contextual approach. Talmon's appeal for an intra-biblical holistic approach to the comparative question must be acknowledged, but the comparison has to go beyond that, including a wider context of
38 According to M. Smith's definition the comparative approach has been charged with being "pseudorthodox" (1969:21), but this terminology seems a labe! too easily applied so that it cannot characterize this complex field ofbiblical studies sufficiently.
39 Mathematically, the relationship between source A and source B could be expressed by A<B, A>B, A-B, A=B, and A/B (Hallo, 1991:314).
40 Malul modifies his statement that one "should not consider the possibility of a reverse direction of borrowing" (1990:90), to: "... this possibility [i.e., ancient Near Eastem source borrowing from biblical source] must be taken into consideration by any serious scholar who approaches his subject matter with impartiality" (1990:90). Hallo mentions a number of interesting phenomena where the possibility of this kind of influence can be demonstrated (1990:6).
41 "We should neither exempt biblical literature from the standards applied to other ancient Near Eastern literatures, nor subject it to standards demanded nowhere eise" (Hallo, 1973:4).



6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY 281
comparisons. Thus a hierarchy of contexts42 valid for comparative purposes should be created, in which the comparative scholar proceeds from the closest contexts to the more distant ones. (4) The question of the "time and place gap" (Malul, 1990: 101) between the biblical and the ANE source has to be answered in terms of the external evidence that is available and which proves the point of contact between the respective cultures. Generally speaking there appears to be enough extra-biblical data which would support a Bronze and Iron Age corroboration between Israel and the ANE.43 However, although "corroboration by itself does not constitute proof [his italics] of the existence of connection" (Malul, 1990: 111), it nevertheless increases the probability of a valid comparison. Only if the corroboration is a possible one, the parallels and contrasts can be evaluated in terms of "coincidence versus uniqueness" (Malul, 1990: 112), and then the question of dependence or independence can be answered.
6.2. COMPARISON OF TEXTUAL AND ICONOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
Any comparison and contrast established in the following section is restricted by two factors: (1) the selection oftexts for the present study; and (2) the selection of iconographic objects for the present study. Since none of these two constituents have been approached from a comprehensive perspective, it stands without question that the resulting picture will lack
42 Pardee argued for such a hierarchy of contexts: "lt seems to me that a frankly detailed hierarchy of contexts, such as those which have been attempted for philological and text-critical comparisons ... would be useful; and this hierarchy would have to be constructed on several levels, including at least geographical and chranological contexts..." (1985 :221 ).
43 Smith, an adamant defender of the source analysis, has accordingly solved the question of the time and place gap by ascribing an exclusively Iran Age (including the Persian period) and Mediterranean backgraund to the biblical text: "This is the outline of Israelite literature, and it belongs part and parcel, soul as weil as body, to the Iran Age and to the Mediterranean, not to the Mesopotamian world" (1969:35). Any Assyriologist will question the validity ofthat statement, and if one reads further on in Smith's rather polemic article, one gets the impression that the present state of OT studies in 1969 is out-dated by now, perhaps, even was then: "For those tasks [i.e., recognizing the relationship between Israelite culture and Iran Age Mediterranean world] students will rely not only on the source analysis and dating worked out by the scholars of the nineteenth century, but also on the great achievements of the past generation..." (1969:35). As much as it is apprapriate to integrate the findings of former scholar's generations into modern research, it becomes increasingly important to advance biblical studies into new avenues, even if it sometimes means, to shake at the foundations of traditionalized hypotheses.



282 6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
completeness. However, throughout the study we have endeavoured to make the motivation for the selection of the texts and objects as transparent as possible, subjecting them to certain governing principles,44 in order to achieve a broad and verifiable basis for the comparative approach. Since the point of reference for the comparative task is the biblical text, we will depart from the eight psalms we have studied in chapter 4 and try to link them to the various motif groups, viz., individual objects presented in chapter 5.45 This procedure seems advisable in view of the fact that it is not the scope of this study to present a discussion on warrior-gods in the ANE, or on Neo-Assyrian glyptic, but rather to understand the God of heaven and warrior metaphors from an iconographic perspective. This approach, however, should not be confused with the one-directional comparative approach criticized above.46 The order of presentation will first address the parallels and then proceed to the contrasts.47 lt is important to note that the form of comparison will present the texts in connection with their relevant iconographic comparative material. The texts have to be understood as expressing the various concepts of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors that have been isolated throughout the exegetical part of the study.
6.2.1. Psalm 18:8-16
(1) ' ... and fire devoured from his mouth' (9a): The first point of contact between the psalm and the iconographic evidence can be found in the description of Yahweh prior to his descent in the clouds, portraying him anthropomorphically with nose and mouth from which smoke and fire are emanating. Figure 93 shows a deity in a standing and in a sitting position with an uraeus coming forth from his mouth.48 This function of the uraeus may be understood along similar lines as the devouring fire from Yahweh' s mouth, i.e., expressing wrath and anger metaphorically described as a
44 The selection of texts was motivated by the statistical evaluation of references as established in chapter 3, whereas the criteria for the choice of iconographic objects has been spelled out in the introduction to the preceding chapter.

consuming fire. However, the biblical context is that of a storm-theophany, while the iconographic image does not refer to such a theme at all, but rather has solar connotations within an Egyptian cultural context (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:156).49 (2) 'Then he spread apart the heavens, and he came down, and thick darkness (was) under his feet' (l0a-b):50 Yahweh is dividing the clouds like a curtain before his coming down. Especially the god in the winged sundisk (Figures 28-36) and god in the winged sundisk with the bow (Figures 8791) motif group are referents for this imagery, since there the heavenly realm is clearly indicated and a connection between the earth is established. The only image where the cloud motif is clearly taken up is in Figure 90 which shows the weather- and sun-god in the winged sundisk with a bow. Next to the god, a row of clouds filled with hail and raindrops are depicted, and the feathery wings of the sundisk viz., god are also connotative of the heavens thick with clouds (cf. our remarks to Figures 87-88). The movement from above to below is indicated in scenes where the god in the winged sundisk is extending his hands downwards, aiming downwards with his bow, or offering the bow to the king below (Figures 31, 87, 90). However, the fact has to be reiterated that the images are mainly associated with Mesopotamia and not in Syro-Palestine, since only Figures 31 and 33 come from that region. Thus only a correlation on a larger scale can be proposed. (3) 'And he mounted a cherub and he flew, and he swooped on the wings of the wind' (1 la-b): Yahweh's ride on the cherub as a means of transport during his descent from heaven is rather rare, especially since we are confronted with a singular form here, and not with a plural (as in Eze 10:18,19 and 11:22). As observed above, the cherub has been associated with the cherubim throne, as described e.g., in Psa 80:2. Cherubim as throne for a deity are especially attested on images originating from the Phoenician coastal line (Figures 68-69 from the 7th to 5th centuries B.C. depicting Melqart the Ba'al of Tyre sitting on a throne supported by two winged sphinxes). In the Syro-Palestinian region no 'occupied' cherubim
49 In trying to establish a correlation between a biblical text and an iconographic image, it is generally not possible (and not endeavoured) to find a one-to-one correspondence between picture and text. Often it is a single element in the text, or the depiction that can be correlated to each other. However, the respective contexts need to be taken into consideration.
so Cf. also vs. 12a-b and 13a-b: 'He appointed darkness as his hiding place around him; his pavilion the darkness of waters, tight clouds. From the brightness before him clouds went by, hail and coals offire'.



284 6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN TIIE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
throne has been found51 and the cherub (winged sphinx) appears to have been employed in a guarding function, often in connection with an ankhsign displaying the Egyptian influences in the local glyptic (cf. Figures 6367). However, the imagery in Psa 18: 11 cannot be understood along the lines of a cherubim throne,52but rather as one cherub portrayed as a creature whose flying abilities are paralleled to the wings of the wind in vs. 11 b, and who is mounted (:i:l7) by Yahweh for his descent from heaven. The weather-god in his chariot (Figure 92) riding through the heavens may be the closest approximation iconography can provide. Furthermore, the rather singular representation in Figure 54 has been connected to Psa 18: 11 (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:389). The element on the stamp seal which is of relevance for the present discussion shows a bearded winged god standing above a single winged sphinx.53 However, Yahweh is explicitly described as flying on the cherub. (4) 'And he sent his arrows and scattered them, and lightnings he multiplied and he confused them' (15a-b): The parallelism between lightning and arrows becomes apparent in this vs., as Yahweh becomes active in the theophany, bringing together the god of heaven and warrior attributes. Repeatedly the importance of the bundle of lightning for the identification of the weather-god has been mentioned and various contexts have been isolated in which the bundle of lightning appears, while especially the active scenes, i.e., where lightning is used as a weapon, are of preeminent interest. Figures 12 and 15 show Ninurta fighting the Anzu dragon, viz., the homed snake, although it cannot be distinguished if the arrows are portrayed in the form of lightning. On Figures 78, 81-83 the lightning serves clearly as a weapon against the homed snake or an imaginary enemy (Figure 78), although it is not depicted in the form of an arrow. Both ideas (lightning as a weapon in the form of an arrow) are brought together in the more detailed depiction of the weather-god in the sun-disk in Figure 91 shooting an arrow with a lightning-like point. In most cases the enemy against whom the attack is directed, is derived from Neo-Assyrian
51 Figure 61 is a depiction of a banquet scene depicting the king sitting on a throne supported by the winged sphinx.
52 Comment Keel and Uehlinger: "Der Vorstellung vom 'Kerubenthroner' liegt nicht die des (einen, Sg.) [all their italics] Kerubs als Reit- oder Fahrtier des Wettergottes von Ps 18,11 zugrunde" (1992:191, n. 124).
53 lt is not altogether clear, if the god is standing on the back of the mythological creature or if he is suspended in mid-air above the wings of the sphinx. In like manner, the winged goddess is shown as hovering above the stylized palm tree and the head of the sphinx. Taking the composition and proportions into consideration it might be a possible interpretation that the winged god and goddess have been added later to the familiar scene of a winged sphinx guarding the sacred tree.

mytbology and can be identified as tbe Anzu dragon/homed snake representing tbe cbaotic forces. Altbough tbe tbeme bas to be understood as a product of tbe Assyrian glyptic repertoire, its reception and adaptation to a Syro-Palestine background can be seen in Figure 15, wbile most depictions come from tbe 9th and 8th centuries B.C. representing depictions of botb tbe weatber- and sun-god. Tbus tbe imagery of Yahweb sbooting arrows in tbe form of tbe meteorological pbenomenon appears to be a wellestablisbed tbeme found in botb the biblical text and ANE iconograpby.54 (5) In contrast to tbe iconograpbic depictions on wbicb tbe gods are usually depicted antbropomorpbically, tbe biblical text limits itself to a description of a few of Yabweb's body parts, tbus retaining tbe notion of tbe deus absconditus tbrougbout tbe description of tbe tbeopbany. Repeatedly tbe covering clouds and darkness are mentioned, wbile tbe accompanying features are described in more detail. While tbe images described above normally include mytbological tbemes (e.g., tbe figbt against tbe dragon), tbe biblical text is clear tbat tbe subject of Yabweb's attack from beaven are tbe king's enemies against wbom tbe arrows are ultimately directed.55 Various otber dynamic elements wbich form part of tbe biblical text (e.g., tbe sbaking of tbe foundations of tbe world, tbe brigbtness before Yahweb in contrast to tbe darkness under bis feet, tbe bail and coals of fire, tbe tbundering, tbe wbole atmospbere of natural turmoil, etc.) find little reflection in tbe iconographic evidence. This may be explained by tbeir dynamic nature wbicb cannot easily be captured by tbe two-dimensional limitations of an image. A number of elements found in tbe description of the tbeopbany in Psa 18:8-16 occasionally find close counterparts in ANE iconograpby, wbereas tbere are also a number of important (eatures wbicb are exclusive to tbe biblical text.
6.2.2. Psalm 21 :9-13
(l) 'Your band found out all your enemies, your rigbt band found out wbo bate you' (9a-b): As observed in tbe exegetical remarks conceming tbis vs., tbe language does not refer to a mere finding of tbe enemy in tbe sense of coming across sometbing. , but ratber bears strong cbaracteristics of war terminology.

54 And also in ANE texts for that matter (cf. Weinfeld, 1986:121-147).
55 A good reflection ofthis theme is found in Figure 87 and 90 which indicate that the god with his aggression is aiding the king.



286 6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE lCONOGRAPHY
smiting god holding the head of an enemy by his hair56 with one hand, whereas the other hand is raised above the head ready to strike the death blow. While this iconographic motif has been popular, especially in Egyptian royal iconography during the beginning of the Iron Age (cf. Figure 2), it also found some repercussion in Mesopotamia (cf. Figure 7) and the Syro-Palestine region (cf. Figure 6), while the depictions from the latter two regions are chronologically dated only to the 8th century B.C. Characteristic for this motif is its closeness of the royal iconography to depictions of deities which at times makes it difficult to distinguish between the two. Figure 7 from Mesopotamia clearly shows a mythological scene and not the king-enemy conflict. The closeness between the enemy motif and the threat of the chaotic forces is demonstrated in Figure 3 on which the enemy has been replaced by the homed snake, held by the smiting figure (cf. Keel, 1972:274f.). The physical seizing of the enemy in Psa 29:9 has tobe understood along the lines of the imagery of the smiting god motif, i.e., God as warrior being actively involved in the attack on the psalmist's enemies.57 Seizing the enemies' head shows the .superiority that the psalmist ascribes to Yahweh in the conflict. (2) 'In his anger he swallowed them and fire devoured them' (10c): The association of Yahweh swallowing the enemies with the devouring fire might refer back to the imagery noted in connection with Psa 18:9 and its affinity to Figure 93. However, the idea is not altogether clear, and further correlation cannot be established.58 (3) 'For you made them (turn their) shoulder' (13a): An interesting feature of the smiting god motif group is the position of the enemy in Figures 2 and 6. Although the figures are in a fleeing position, i.e., the whole body appears to be moving away from the king, the shoulders are tumed toward him, and the enemy is facing the king. These depictions may be able to
56 Cf. below our remarks to Psa 68:22.
57 Comments Keel on the function of the smiting god motif particularly in Egyptian iconography: "Die Bedeutung dieser Abbildungen lag nicht Qedenfalls nicht hauptsächlich) in einem Beitrag psychologisch-propagandistischer Natur, was modern gedacht ist, sondern ihre Aufgabe war, in diesem gefährdeten Gebiet [i.e., the northern borders of the Egyptian empire] auf magische Weise die unwiderstehlich siegreiche Macht des ägyptischen Königs gegenwärtig zu setzen.... Diese Auffassung erklärt die Beliebtheit des Themas. Je häufiger das 'Zauberbild' dargestellt wurde, um so stärker wurde die Macht des Pharao, das Land gegenüber allen Angriffen zu verteidigen" (1972:274).
58 While in Psa 18:9 fire is coming forth from the mouth of god, in Psa 21:10 he is swallowing the enemies. Parallel in both vss. is the complete destruction of the enemies indicated by the devouring fire.



6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY 287
explain the somewhat opposing metaphors of 13a and 13b. Although the enemy is portrayed in flight, his shoulder is turned toward the king, exposing his face for Yahweh's attack (cf. Keel, 1972:figs. 397, 398, 400a, 400c, and 402). The turning of the shoulder appears to be a symbol of utter submission and surrender, since the initial purpose of fleeing indicated by the figures' postures cannot be accomplished.59 (4) ' ... with your bowstring you took aim against their faces' (13a): In accordance with the preceding point, Yahweh takes aim with the bow6° against the now exposed face of the enemy. Although the smiting god motif did not occur in connection with a god aiming a bow at an enemy, there are a nurnber of depictions which contribute to the understanding of the imagery. Especially Figure 11 appears to be of prime interest,61 since it combines an archer scene with a god extending the curved sword toward the pharaoh, a combination reminiscent of Psa 21: 13. While the god is depicted with the curved sword extended toward the pharaoh as standing on the opposite side of a shooting target, the pharaoh is aiming with the bow at the target to which two Semitic captives are bound, one facing the king and one facing the god. Besides these interesting depictions, gods with bows airning against enemies can be seen in Figures 90 and 91 both of NeoAssyrian origin. (5) 'You put them as (into) a fiery furnace at the time ofyour appearance, o Yahweh' (l0a-b): Although this form of capital punishrnent has been known throughout the ANE,62 no iconographic image corresponding to such a practice could be identified.63 Furtherrnore, the attack on the enemy's offspring as described in vs. lla-b and the frustrated attempts of the enemy to plot against Yahweh in vs. 12a-b, appear to go beyond the capacity of an iconographic depiction.

6.2.3. Psalm 29:3-9
(1) 'The voice of Yahweh is upon waters, the God of glory thunders' (3ab): The main motif of Psa 29, the il)il; '?ip has been identified as referring to the approaching sound of a thunderstorm moving inland from the Mediterranean. lt depicts Yahweh as storm- and weather-god, to which the iconographic motif of the god in the winged sundisk probably comes closest. The audible sound of thunder, obviously, cannot be easily reproduced by an iconographic image, but the densely feathered wings of the god in the winged sundisk have repeatedly been identified as symbolizing the dark clouds and stormy heavens associated with a thunderstorm (cf. Figures 88, 90, and 91).64 With regard to the thunder: the club which the smiting weather-god often holds in his hand (e.g., Figure 75) has been associated with the sound of thunder in the way of Ba'al beating the heavens like a drum with his club, but the club should rather be understood as a weapon in the fight against an enemy, though not be confused with the thunderbolt, viz., lightning (Keel, 1972: 192). (2) ' ... Yahweh is over mighty waters' (3c): Furthermore, while primarily
symbolizing the Mediterranean in this context, the •':;!J •:o have repeatedly been associated with the chaotic forces represented by the horned snake of Canaanite mythology. Figures 17-20 illustrate the struggle of the Canaanite-Egyptian Ba'al-Seth, with the spear against the horned snake. The depictions show him thrusting his weapon in a downward movement into the body of the snake. Most of the images depicting this motif originated during the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age I. However, in Psa 29 no direct struggle is reflected between Yahweh and the chaotic waters; a fact which necessitates some caution toward an interpretation of the biblical text along mythological lines.65 (3) 'And he makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young of an aurochs' (6a-b): The association ofthe weather-god with mountains can be observed in Figure 79 and Figure 80 in which he is standing on two or three mountain tops, although there is no indication of a similar destructive
64 There is a certain ambivalence in the interpretation of the god in the winged sundisk: while in most cases the deity can be identified with the Assyrian sun-god Sama§ (and not with Asshur!), he often is found in contexts displaying storm- and weather-god attributes (cf. the clouds in Figure 90 or the lightning arrow in Figure 91, or even the association of Samas with rain in Figures 29, 32, and 89). lt is, however, of little consequence for the purpose ofthe present study, ifthe god in the winged sundisk is to be identified with Sama§ or with Asshur.
65 Cf. also the depiction of the sun-god sitting enthroned in bis temple above the waters on a stone tablet from Sippar dated to the beginning of the 9ih century B.C. (Keel, 1972:153, fig. 239).

earthquake-like event on the two seals from Northem Syria representing this motif. While in the iconographic depictions of gods striding over mountains, the mountains are portrayed as a constant and stabile factor supporting the mountain-god, almost as a cultic pedestal, the psalmist describes them as fragile objects subjected to Yahweh's earthquake which causes them to skip uncontrollably. Although the author of the psalm takes up the motif of the mountain, he does not use the imagery in the expected manner, a fact that could be associated with polemic intentions. (4) 'The voice of Yahweh hews out lightning' (7a): In similar fashion to Psa 18: 15, Yahweh's appearance, here Yahweh's voice, is associated with lightning. While the imagery behind the vs. is that of the effect of Yahweh's voice on the rocky surface of the mountains, the images showing the weather-god using the bundle of lightning as a weapon may serve as comparative material (Figure 78, 81-83). The famous 'Ba'al au foudre' 66 (Figure 75) with the vegetation spear may be an indicator for the combination of the imagery of lightning with fertility. Comments Keel: "Wie Jahwe den Wind herausführt, so schaffen die Blitze (ikonographisch: die Lanze) dem Regen einen Weg. Der Regen aber ermöglicht die Vegetation (ikonographisch: sprossender Baum)" (1972: 194). However, while the iconographic depictions may picture the lightning as a contributing factor to fertility, Psa 29 portrays its effects on fauna and flora in a rather destructive way, pointing rather to the warrior imagery: 67 'The voice of Yahweh breaks cedars, yes, Yahweh, shatters the cedars of Lebanon' (5a-b), and: 'The voice of Yahweh causes the desert to writhe, Yahweh causes the desert Kadesh to writhe. The voice of Yahweh makes the hinds to bring forth and lays bare the forests' (8a-9b). (5) The overall picture that emerges from a comparison of Psa 29:3-9 with the iconographic evidence is a tendency toward using the prevalent iconographic motifs of particularly the Northem Syrian repertoire, but reapplying them polemically and subjecting them to the force of Yahweh's voice as the ultimate controlling factor in the upheaval of nature. The northem geography of the psalm furthermore contributes to such an understanding, while the imagery employed in the psalm has been utilized in such a way that it leads from the known to the surprising, i.e., reinterpreting the imagery from the perspective and under the dominion of Yahweh's voice. Especially iconographic objects depicting the smiting god motif seem to represent possible models for such a reinterpretation.
66 The designation is a good demonstration of a traditionalized misinterpretation.

6.2.4. Psalm 46:7-12
(1) 'Nations raged, kingdoms slipped - he raised his voice: the earth melted' (7a-b): Allusion to the appearance of God in the thunder, as observed above in Psa 29, is made via the theophanic element ofYahweh's voice. Although the context here in Psa 46 is not so much describing a natural phenomenon, it nevertheless demonstrates the warrior properties of the ilJil~ '?ip, since the effects on the whole earth are recorded to be as destructive as in the description of the divine thunderstorm in Psa 29.68 The earth is understood as synonymous to the nations and kingdoms from vs. 7a. Referents for this imagery can be found in Figures 2, 3, 6, and 9 which show gods in the smiting position with various enemies.69 While the connection is the above mentioned relationship between the voice of Yahweh, i.e., his thunder, and the club raised above its head, the aggressive connotation of the scene becomes evident through the depictions of the god's enemies. On Figures 2 and 6 it is a human enemy who is subjected by the king thereby representing the hostile nations and kingdoms
mentioned in vs. 7.7° Figure 3 shows the smiting god raising his curved sword against the mythological Apophis-snake, indicating the relationship between the chaotic forces and the enemies as the object of the god's aggression. Figure 9 shows the motif at a later stage, depicting Heracles with a club raised above his head grasping the hind leg of a lion, thus depicting the supremacy of the god over the untamed forces of nature represented by the lion. In like fashion, Psa 46:7 portrays Yahweh's supremacy over mankind, but also over the inhabited world, and from the reaction of the earth toward Yahweh's appearance, i.e., its melting after he has been raising his voice, one expects a continuance of the scene along the lines of the warrior imagery created in this vs. (2) 'Yahweh of hosts (is) with us' (8a/12a): The divine epithet nitit:;i~ ilJil~ communicates the warrior imagery of the psalm -and is indicative of the notion that Yahweh is with the king and his people in the fight against the
68 Tue melting away ofthe earth (p~ J1on) is indicative ofGod's acts ofjudgement.
69 On Figures 2 and 3 the club is replaced by the curved sword, but the general composition ofthe scene with king/god vs. enemy/snake is retained, and the images thus can serve as comparative material for the vs. under consideration.
70 Interestingly, the king or god in the smiting position with an enemy is often portrayed out of proportion, at times towering over the eneniy. From this way of depiction it becomes apparent that the motivation for this iconographic motif is not the representation of a battle scene or an actual combat, but the illustration of the supremacy ofthe king on an abstracted level (cf. notes 57 and 86).

enemies.71 There are several images among the selection of objects for this study which reflect this idea: Figure 11, the Ramessidian cylinder seal from Beth Shean, shows the pharaoh shooting at a target on which two Asiatic prisoners are bound. In the background of the scene Reshef is standing extending one hand toward the pharaoh in which he holds a curved sword thus condoning and supporting the action of the king. An even more active involvement of the god in warfare is found in Figure 87 and 88 where the Assyrian sun-god Samas offers the bow to the Assyrian king who is holding a group of captives on a rope. Again, the god is presenting a token of his support for the king's warfare, here in retrospect, since the battle has already taken place. Thus the bow becomes a sign of dominance after battle,72 an idea which is reminiscent of the rainbow in Gen 9 which Yahweh gives as a sign ofhis covenant with humankind. 73 Finally, Figure 90 demonstrates the god's involvement in the actual battle. Although the tile is broken off at the bottom, the scene can be reconstructed with certainty.74 While the king is pursuing his enemy with his chariot, the warrior- and sun-god Samas with wings and feathery tail can be seen above the king in a corona of sun-rays. He is pointing his arrow into the direction of the fleeing enemies, thereby making it clear, that it is not the king who is doing the actual fighting but the god himself on behalf of the king. The expression in Psa 46:8 ~J9.i,, nit1:;i~ il)il~ 'Yahweh of hosts with us' has tobe
71 Yahweh's intervention on behalf of the king and his people is one of the goveming characteristics in the description of Israelite warfare (cf. Kang, 1989:204-208). The sarne notion is found throughout the ANE (cf. Kang, 1989:45f., 65-70, 101-105).
72 During war, the god is depicted as aiming with his bow at the king's enemies (Figure 90), whereas after battle the god offers the bow with the bowstring tumed away from the god to the king as a sign of dominance (Figures 87-88). Comments Wilkinson with regard to this gesture: "But important exceptions to this stance [i.e., the bow held in the normal position with bowstring tumed towards the holding person] are found in Egyptian, Mesopotarnian, and Iranian art, where a number ofrepresentations show kings in battle, holding audience, receiving tribute from subject peoples, or standing before servants while holding a bow backwards, with the bowstring outward. The bow is obviously useless when held in this manner, and the pose thus appears to represent a formalized gesture. While this stance has sometimes been thought to signify the accomplishment ofhunting feats or military victories, it is found in many other contexts, and a number ofyears ago, I came to the conclusion that it is more likely that the 'tumed bow' represents a formal gesture of dominance" (1994:200).
73 Cf. Uehlinger (1989:195-197) who follows Rüterswörden (1988:247-263) in linking the rainbow of Gen 9 with the real bow an idea which is expressed by Figure 87 and 88.
74 Cf. a more complete depiction of the scene can be seen on a relief from Nimrod dating to the 9th century B.C., on which the Assyrian king is pursuing his enemies with a chariot. He has pointed his bow against the fleeing group of enemies while above the chariot Sarnas can be seen in the winged sundisk in an identical posture, aiming his bow into the sarne direction (Keel, 1972:pl. 20).

understood from a military perspective along the lines of God intervening in warfare on behalf ofhis people. (3) 'Come! - behold the works ofYahweh who establishes terrifying events on the earth' (9a-b): The niotP mentioned in 9b mark the turn of the psalm into an unexpected direction. While one anticipates further demonstrations of Yahweh's warfare along the usual lines of ANE warfare, as demonstrated by various iconographic motifs (Figures 1-12, 15-20, 75-78, 81-83, 90, and 91), vs. lOa-c suddenly introduced quite a different scenario: 'Who causes wars to cease to the end of the earth; the bow he shatters, he cuts in pieces the spear, wagons he bums with fire'. Although the language continues tobe saturated with war imagery the object of the verbal action is not the enemy or any other hostile entity, but the implements of warfare themselves. Yahweh is destroying the weapons on a universal scale (10a) and puts an end to war between all nations. While the destruction of weaponry is a motif found in ANE iconography denoting the utter humiliation and desperation of a warrior,75 we are not aware of an image which ascribes such an activity to a god or goddess. The function of deities in the iconographic depiction of warrior motifs appears to be restricted to a supportive or aggressive role in connection with warlike imagery. Thus the image of Yahweh in Psa 46 stands in contrast to the iconographic sources, while the universalistic tendency of the psalm deserves extra mention, in that the end of the war is not limited to the people of Israel, but to the whole earth. Although the depiction of Yahweh follows along the lines of the warrior metaphor in destroying the weaponry of the enemies, he transcends the imagery in stepping out of the expected scheme of divine warfare in expressively putting an end to all warfare on a universal scale.
6.2.5. Psalm 65:10-14
(1) 'You have taken care of the land and you give overflowing to it, you make it exceedingly rich' (1 Oa-b): Yahweh taking care of the land of Palestine in the form of its vegetation and agricultural produce is an imagery for which an iconographic counterpart could be found in the
75 Cf. the depiction of an Elamite officer who is cutting his bow in half before being executed (Keel, 1972:218-220, fig. 328), or a group of Canaanite soldiers fleeing to the top of rock, while one of the soldiers is breaking his javelin in utter desperation (Keel, 1972:159f., fig. 245). Comments Keel with regard to Psa 46:10 and its relationship to the depiction ofthe Elamite officer: "Was der elamitische Offizier hier an seinem Bogen und damit an seinem Vertrauen auf ihn tut, das wird Jahwe bei seinem Erscheinen allen Waffen der Welt und jedem Vertrauen auf sie antun. Er wird sie vernichten und dem Vertrauen auf brutale Gewalt und Machtpolitik ein Ende bereiten (46, 10 76, 4-6....)" (1972:218).

stylized palm tree surrounded by streams of waters. The sacred palm tree symbolizes the ordered cosmos, while its emphasis lies in the realm of fertility, vegetation, and reproduction (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:265f.). A number of images represent the motif of the sacred palm tree, varying in emphasis: Figure 43 shows the palm tree resting on a stylized mountain. lt is surrounded by streams of water flowing from a winged sundisk into vases standing on the ground. Figure 44 follows along the same lines, whereas the tree is resting on the ground, and two worshippers are holding on to the water streams and partaking in the provided blessing. In similar fashion Figure 45 only adds the detail of an armed Ishtar next to the palm tree scene, indicating the affinity of that goddess to the connotation of fertility. The only example from Syro-Palestine, Figure 46, shows the palm tree without streams of water as a representation of a fertility goddess around which two adorants are dancing. lt becomes apparent that the sacred palm tree could serve as a symbol of fertility, but as such, also as a representation ofthe orderly cosmos, the cycle of vegetation. However, it is Yahweh who is the generator of the blessings for the land in Psa 65: 1Oa-b. Palm tree and water stream represent the land and its overflowing produce. (2) 'The canal of God is füll of water' (1 Oe): As observed in the exegetical notes to Psa 46: 1Oe, the canal of water has to be understood as a conduit for rain from the heavenly realm to the earth. This occurs especially with the water-providing god motif group, but also in representations of the god in the winged sundisk with streams of waters emanating from the wings downwards toward the earth (Figures 29, 32, and 89). Figures 37-42 represent the water-providing god, and often depict the Babylonian waterand mountain-god Ea, or one of his representative sub-deities in their capacity of watering the earth by means of a vase from which water flows downwards, often into another vase, thereby creating the canals of the god Ea.76 The iconography of that motif group is of Middle-Assyrian and Middle-Babylonian origin, reaching into the Neo-Assyrian glyptic repertoire, while there are no representations of that motif group found in Palestinian contexts. Psa 65: 1Oe shows that the conception of the phenomenon of rainfall by means of a canal linking heaven and earth was commonplace throughout the ANE. Thus the life-giving water originates in the presence of the deity. (3) 'You provide her grain, for in such a way prepare it. Watering its furrows, leveling its ridges' (lOd-e, lla): Figure 59 serves as the most promising candidate for an iconographic reflection of this imagery. The

cylinder seal housed in the BIF dating to the 9th century B.C. shows the weather-god Adad handing three ears of com to Ishtar who is holding a tambourine. The relationship between Ishtar and Adad has a strong connotation of fertility, enhanced by the symbolic gesture of the god and the presence of agricultural activities in the background of the scene. The providing of grain has to be understood as a pars pro toto for the agricultural produce of the land, securing the livelihood of the people. (4) 'With heavy showers you soften it up, its sprouting you bless' (llb): Figure 60 shows an interesting and often discussed motif77 found on a Tridacna-shell from Arad dating to around 700 B.C.78 lt shows the upper body of a bearded deity who has raised his hand in the typical gesture of blessing, emanating from a sundisk which is surrounded by an abundance of lotus flower. In similar fashion to Psa 65: 11 b the god is blessing the sprouting vegetation around him, thus combining solar attributes with creative power indicated by the presence of the lotus flowers. Another depiction which corresponds to the imagery of 1lb is the 'Ba'al au foudre' (Figure 75) whose spear shaft ends in a sprouting tree, indicating the close relationship between fertility and the characteristic of the warrior-god, i.e., the spear-like weapon. Figure 58 shows a seal impression from Nippur dating to the end of the Late Bronze Age which also corresponds to the imagery of 11b. Here the water- and mountain-god Ea is depicted in a kneeling position within a mountain-like double-faced figure which can be identified as his helper Usmü who is holding the front legs of two winged griffins, representing the fauna. Surrounding the gods, a lush vegetation, mountains, and the heaven symbolized by the flying eagles can be seen, thus creating an ordered cosmos in which the water-providing god is at the center. (5) ' ... and your tracks drip fatness' (12b): Yahweh's tracks have been associated with the tracks of Ba'al 's chariot riding through the land. While we have sources for the chariot of the weather-god in ANE iconography (Figure 92), there is little indication in Psa 65 which would point to Yahweh riding a chariot through the countryside.79 The remainder of Psa 65 rather describes the various agricultural blessings bestowed on the SyroPalestinian region by Yahweh's sending ofrain and fertility.

6.2.6. Psalm 68: 15-22
(1) 'A mountain of gods is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan. Why do you watch with envy, o mountains with peaks, the mountain God has desired as his dwelling? Yes, Yahweh will abide (there) forever' (16a-b, 17a-c): The mountainous dwellings of the gods from a Transjordan geographical perspective versus the superiority of Yahweh's mountain is the theme of these two vss. This imagery is expressed iconographically by depictions of gods striding over mountains, i.e., our Figures 79 and 80. For both images a Syrian background may be assumed. Nevertheless, they are rather early for our comparative purposes, falling into the chronological margin set for this study.80 They depict gods who are closely associated with mountains. Interestingly, the mountain-god in ANE iconography is usually depicted on either two or three mountains, rarely as striding over only one mountain (cf. Dijkstra, 1991:pl. 1-3),81 while the mountain of God is set into contrast with the many mountains of the gods.82 The mountains with many peaks represent an assemblage of various gods (cf. Figure 74 which shows a procession of Neo-Assyrian gods) who are nevertheless envious toward the one mountain, viz., the one and only God. Figure 58 also shows the close relationship between god and mountain, depicting the water- and mountain-god Ea within another god or semi-god which is sketched in the form of a mountain, while a row of mountains form the horizon of the image. Comments Keel on the rivalry between the mountains of the gods and Yahweh's mountain as expressed in this vs.: Von Jahwe, der auf dem Zion wohnt, und nicht von irgendwelchen heiligen Bergen soll der Beter sein Heil erwarten (121, lt). Ihnen allen hat Jahwe den Zion vorgezogen. Lauernd und mißgünstig blicken die hohen Berge der Umgebung auf ihn herab (68, 16f). Denn trotz seines bescheidenen Äußeren ist er der wirkliche Götterberg, der eigentliche Zaphon (48, 3) (1972: 102). (2) 'The chariots of God are twice ten-thousand, thousands of bright ones' (18a-b): While the chariot of the weather-god can be found in Figure 92 illustrating the association of the god with a war chariot, in Psa 68: 18a-b
80 We have, however, established that Psa 68 is also using rather 'old' imagery, i.e., the conquest battles east of the Jordan river (cf. the exegetical notes to Psa 68).
81 lt appears that the god on pi. 3:2 (Dijkstra, 1991:140) is striding over two mountains which have been moved closely together by the seal cutter.
82 Another example given by Dijkstra demonstrates the identification of god and mountain in the most explicit way (1991:pl. 1:2). He describes the object as follows: "This seal shows the weather-god standing on two scaled mountains, facing to the left, where a third mountain in the form of the mountain-god is seen, who offers an animal to the weather-god..." (1991:129).



296 6. WARRIOR AND Goo OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
the imagery seems to be more along the lines of a procession of the heavenly hast (the 'bright ones') which is following Yahweh to the chosen mountain, and ultimately, synonymously to his mountain, into his sanctuary: 'Adonai has come from Sinai into the sanctuary' (18c). Similar to Figure 60, there are depictions found on Tridacna-shells from Sippar which show the god in the lotus nimbus flanked by two horsemen. Although like representations have not been surfaced in Syro-Palestine, the terra-cotta figures of horses and horsemen from Jerusalem have in analogy been associated with the hast of Yahweh. 83 While the correlation is indirect and no chariots are mentioned, it appears safe to say that the imagery of Yahweh's accompanying military hast in the form of chariots and 'bright ones' finds some repercussions in ANE iconography. Since there is an association between the hast of heaven and astral imagery, Figures 48-53 may serve as a point of comparison. On all six images Ishtar appears surrounded by a nimbus of stars depicted with varying degrees of craftsmanship. In like manner, Yahweh is surrounded by the hast of heaven as he victoriously proceeds to his sanctuary. (3) 'You ascended to the height, you took prisoners, you received gifts from mankind' (19a-b): The victory procession depicted in vs. 19 is known from royal iconography throughout the ANE,84 but the images usually focus on the king and do not represent the god as the object of the various characteristics associated with such a procession. Figure 87 shows the Assyrian king with captives while the sun-god in the winged sundisk offers his blessing through the hand and the bow he is extending toward the king. Gods receiving gifts or offerings from men or worshippers are depicted in
83 Keel and Uehlinger comment: "Gehören die palästinensischen Reiter wie die auf der Tridacna aus Sippar zur Sphäre eines derartigen EI-artigen Himmels- und Schöpfergottes - der in Juda kaum ein anderer als Jahwe gewesen sein kann -, dann legt es sich nahe, die Terrakottastatuetten als populäre, anthropomorphe Repräsentationen des 'Himmelsheeres' [their italics] zu verstehen. Semantisch kommt sowohl im Bildmotiv des Reiters (vgl. Jer 6,23!) als auch im Kollektivnamen 'Himmelsheer' der Aspekt kriegerischer Epiphanie zum Ausdruck" (1992:396). In our opinion, the weakness of the argument lies in the analogy between the god found on the Tridacnashell from Sippar, and the creator-god from Palestine. However, the identification, or at least, the correlation of horsemen and host of heaven appears possible. That the horses have celestial or solar connotations, is shown by the fact that they are often carrying sundisks on their head - which would associate them rather with the sun-god.
84 Cf. the ivory plaque from Megiddo found on our Figure 61: the halfwhich is missing in our depiction shows a king retuming from battle with two naked captives walking in front ofhis chariot (Keel and Uehlinger, 1992:71, fig. 65).

ANE iconography, although not in the contexts ofvictory processions (e.g., Figure 24).85
(4) 'Verily - God will shatter the head of his enemies, the hairy scalps of those who continuously walk in their trespasses' (22a-b): The smiting of the enemy's head described in this vs. is analogue to the familiar smiting god motif from ANE iconography, represented by Figures 1-11, 75-83 with the gesture of the raised arm forming the largest common denominator of the various motif groups discussed within the limits ofthe present study. While the motif usually depicts weather- and war-gods with different geographical and chronological characteristics, it is clear that the gesture always indicates the supremacy of the god versus the subjugation of the enemy or animal respectively. Tue detail of the 'hairy skull' mentioned in 22b is not a byproduct of the psalmist's vivid imagination or an exercise in the parallelismus membrorum of Hebrew verse, but as can be seen from Figures 2, 6, and 7, it serves as an important part of the imagery. Comments Keel: "Der haarige Scheitel des Gefangenen erscheint auch in den Pss als Charakteristikum der Feinde (68, 22). Er soll das Tier- und Triebhafte signalisieren..." (1972:271). Thus the subjugation of the enemy is closely associated with the triumph over the chaotic forces, represented by the hairy skull of the enemy. From a number of images it becomes apparent that the smiting god motif has been isolated from a concrete war situation, reducing the gesture of the raised arm holding the weapon to strike at an enemy to a mere emblem, a symbol of victory and dominion (cf. Figures 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 75, 76-80). Particularly, depictions where no real enemy is visible or where the raised weapon is of such proportions that it can only be accredited with symbolic value (e.g., Figure 80), illustrate this tendency. Thus the smiting god becomes the menacing god without active involvement in the battle, but portrayed in a canonized position with almost magical propensities (cf. Keel, 1972:274).86 The emphasis of the menacing god posture is apotropaic instead ofvictorious. However, with regard to Psa 68:22a-b it appears reasonable to conclude that the emphasis lies on Yahweh's victory and subjugation of the enemies, whereas it is not
85 On the Sheshonk relieffrom Karnak:, it is the god Amun who is offering Asiatic captives to the pharaoh (Keel, 1972:281, pi. 22).
86 In his concluding remarks on the study on the Canaanite gods Reshef and Ba'al during the Late Bronze and Iron Age I periods, Comelius observes rightly with regard to the smiting god motif: "The term 'menacing god' has been used to describe figures with a raised hand or fist, sometimes holding a weapon in the same threatening way. This has been described as the pose of the so-called 'smiting god' .... However, this term is somewhat misleading as it is tak:en from the figure ofthe so-called 'smiting pharaoh' ... who grabs the enemy and is about to strike him down with a raised weapon (usually a IJps-sword)" (1994:255).

intended tobe a literal description of Yahweh's warfare, but follows along the lines of ANE iconography in the depiction of the imagery, i.e., as a representation of Yahweh' s dominion. (5) 'When Shaddai scattered kings, thereby it snowed on Zalmon' (15a-b): While the interpretation of this vs. is not without problems, the imagery of Yahweh's warfare and judgement against the kings by means of falling snow designates an imagery which lacks representation in ANE iconography. The closest approximation to it may be found in the depiction of the clouds filled with rain of hail in Figure 90, but even here the image of falling rain is not represented.
6.2.7. Psalm 83:14-18
(1) 'My God, make them like thistledown, like chaff before the wind' (14ab): The imagery of chaff being blown by the wind as an effect of Yahweh's intervention is connected to the theophanic event which is accompanied by the natural phenomenon of a storm. An explicit storm imagery is not easily found in ANE iconography, since dynamic processes like heavy winds or falling snow (cf. above) are not easily captured on an iconographic level. The weather-god Tarhunzas riding on his chariot through the heavens may serve as a representation of wind (Figure 92). (2) 'As fire consumes the forest, and as the flame scorches the mountains' (15a-b): Yahweh pursuing his enemies with fire can be found in the imagery of the weather-god fighting with the bundle of lightning (Figures 81-83), because the description of the psalm is reminiscent of a heavy thunderstorm in which lightning plays a dominant role as well. All three images show the weather-god Ninurta or Adad87 fighting the Anzu snake, whereas his main weapon is the bundle of lightning. Interestingly, in Figure 21 which also shows Ninurta in a more passive stance, it is his characteristic animal, the homed dragon, which demonstrates the lightning weapon in the form of the three-forked bundle of lightning emanating from its mouth. But since the dragon serves as a second representation ofNinurta (Moortgat-Correns, 1988: 126), the image represents the weather-god fighting with the bundle of lightning. Although not along the lines of the imagery of lightning, the depiction of the uraeus emanating from the god's mouth in Figure 93 may be mentioned which may also serve as a point of comparison, yet without the necessary context of storm imagery. (3) 'In like manner you shall pursue them with your whirlwind, and with your storm you shall terrify them' (16a-b): The imagery of the violent

stonn continues and the depiction mentioned above in connection with vs. 14 is relevant here as well. Furthennore, the interpretation of the feathery corona surrounding the winged sundisk in Figure 87 may be taken as a further indication for stonn imagery. One, however, misses the dynamic and violent depiction of the thunderstonn given in the psalm in comparison with the depictions found on the images. (4) 'Fill their faces with shame' (17a): Although no direct iconographic parallel could be established for this figurative expression denoting the utter humiliation of the enemy,88 the imagery is referring to a similar situation as the victory procession discussed with regard to Psa 68:19. The embarrassment ofthe enemy is depicted in Figure 87 found on the 'broken obelisk' from Niniveh which shows a group of captives in front of the Assyrian king with their faces turned upwardly toward him, their hands raised in a gesture of adoration. He is holding a rope in his hand which leads through rings which have been placed into the captives' noses. Thus, by way of an iconographic detail, their faces are filled with shame in similar fashion to the depiction of Psa 83. However, the ultimate objective of the enemy's humiliation in the psalm is not his destruction, but his acknowledgement ofYahweh.89 (5) On the whole Psa 83 demonstrates the affinity between the warrior and god of heaven metaphors in describing the destructive effect of the thunderstonn and equating it with a weapon Yahweh employs in the destruction of the enemies. This imagery especially becomes apparent in Figure 91 where Samas is directing an arrow of lightning with his bow against an imaginary enemy.
6.2.8. Psalm 144:5-8
(1) 'Yahweh, spread apart your heavens, so that you may come down' (Sa): Though in the form of an invocation directed toward Yahweh, the vs. refers back to Psa 18:10 in requesting his theophany by spreading apart the cloud cover and descending from heaven. In like fashion, the god in the winged sundisk with or without bow fonns the most promising comparative material for this imagery (Figures 28-36 and 87-91), whereas especially Figure 90 and possibly Figure 88 include the aspect of the sun-god's
88 ANE iconography normally cannot express facial emotions, and thus resorts to gestures in order to communicate emotions.

association with clouds. However, with the exception ofFigures 31 and 33, all the images have been found outside of the Syro-Palestinian realm. (2) ' ... touch the mountains, so that they may smoke' (5b): The mountain imagery of this colon is in direct reference to Psa 104:32, thus combining the picture of Yahweh's descent on the clouds with the mountain imagery in an innovative manner. As observed with regard to Psa 68, the mountainous dwellings of the gods are subjected to the destructive effect of Yahweh's appearance, and not depicted as a secure and stable element in ANE mythological thought as portrayed in Figures 79 and 80 on which the mountain-gods are striding over two or three mountain tops.90
90 Since Psa 104 has not been included in the selection of texts for this study, a short note may be in order to establish the relationship between the psalm and the present discussion. Psa 104 ascribes attributes to Yahweh which can be related to the sun-god and storm-god of ANE iconography, as becomes especially apparent from vss. 1-4: 'Bless the Lord, 0 my soul! 0 Lord my God, thou art very great! Thou art clothed with honor and majesty, who coverest thyself with light as with a garment, who hast stretched out the heavens like a tent, who hast laid the beams of thy chambers on the waters, who makest the clouds thy chariot, who ridest on the wings of the wind, who makest the winds thy messengers, fire and flame thy ministers' (RSV). The affinity ofthe psalm to the hymn on the sun by Akhenaten has been noted (especially vss.19-30), and discussed repeatedly (for a short bibliography of studies on the relationship between the Egyptian hymn dating to the 14th century B.C. and Psa 104, cf. Dion, 1991:59, n. 65), but it has until recently been neglected that the language of the psalm is also clearly oriented on the imagery of the storm-god (cf. Dion, 1991 :48-58). However, the question of how the chronological gap between the Egyptian hymn and the psalm can be adequately bridged, remains uncertain (Dion, 1991:61f.). Dion concludes his observations: "This psalm is a model of mature Yahwistic monism.... When he [the psalmist] portrays YHWH's personal appearance, narrates the creation of an orderly world and accounts for the vital supply of water sustaining all realms of animal land plant life, the psalmist follows many biblical predecessors in borrowing a wealth of epithets and imagery from the storm-god mythology. In a unique move, he develops his enticing picture ofthe world even further and asserts the dependence of all life upon YHWH with the help of a form of Akhenaten's legacy still accessible in his own time. But far from him to sing of apolar pair of supreme deities, or to merge them into one another. His hymn is most explicitly addressed to the only God of post-exilic Judah, the old war-god YHWH..." (1991 :69). For Keel this combination of Egyptian sun-god and Mesopotamian storm-god served as a controlling factor in the formulation of Israelite monotheism: "... der aktive, nahe, punktuell eingreifende Wetter-, Sturm- und Kriegsgott Vorderasiens und der beständige, die Welt andauernd erhaltende und erleuchtende, dynastische Sonnengott der Ägypter. In Jahwe sollten sich diese beiden großen Gottheiten der altorientalischen Welt in der ersten Hälfte des 1. Jts. v. Chr. verbinden. Jahwe gewann so eine Statur, die ihn zu einer sehr bedeutenden Stellung prädestinierte" (1994b:82f.). While Keel places the formulation of an Israelite Yahwistic confession to the pre-exilic period between 600 and 587 B.C., he portrays the peculiarities of Israelite monotheism over against the Egyptian monotheistic tendencies of Akhenaten: "Der judäisch-jüdische Monotheismus ist im Gegensatz zum Lichtmonotheismus geschichts-, gesellschafts- und gerechtigkeitsbezogen. Das ist schon in Jahwes Kampf- und Sonnengott-Vergangenheit angelegt" (1994b:92). Without entering the current discussion on the origins oflsraelite monotheism, it appears reasonable to suggest that the notion ofYahweh as supreme god

(3) 'Flash forth lightning and scatter them, send your arrows and confuse them' (6a-b): The familiar lightning/arrows imagery is an invocational reworking of Psa 18:15 where we observed the well-established iconographic background for this motif. lt becomes clear that the weapons ascribed to Yahweh are of a meteorological nature. Figures 12 and 15 show Ninurta fighting the horned snake, viz., another Mischwesen representing the chaotic forces, and that is probably the focus of the imagery presented in Psa 144 as the following vs. demonstrates.91 (4) 'Stretch out your hand from the height, set me free and deliver me from mighty waters, from the hand of foreigners' (7a-d): The description of Yahweh as reaching out from above and rescuing the psalmist from the mighty waters, can be associated with the Chaoskampf motif found in Figures 17-20 on which the Egyptian-Canaanite Ba'al-Seth is thrusting a long spear downwards into the body of a horned snake (especially Figures 18 and 19). This movement from above to below indicates the same dimensional circumstances as described in Psa 144:7, i.e., Yahweh from above is reaching downwards to save the psalmist from the mighty waters, the chaotic forces, represented by the horned snake on the iconographic material, although Yahweh does not fight the mighty waters but rather rescues the psalmist from it. Furthermore, the close affinity between the chaotic forces and human enemies is expressed through the two parallel colons 7c and 7d: the 'mighty waters' appear almost interchangeable with the 'hand of foreigners' representing the enemies.
6.2.9. Iconographic Contrasts
In reversing the direction of comparison, i.e., from the iconographic image toward the biblical text,92 a number of objects assembled for this study have made little impact on the comparative section. Especially Figures 22-27 and 48-57 have featured only as secondary evidence. This may be the reflection of a limited selection of texts and a broadening of the biblical scope may enhance the iconographic points of comparisons. Nevertheless, if one considers the motif groups under which these images fall, certain peculiarities become apparent. (1) Figures 22-27 belong to the god/dess in arms motif, consisting exclusively of Neo-Assyrian cylinder seals on which normally an armed
expressed by the warrior and god of heaven metaphors can be traced to an early origin, as (at least) Psa 18 shows. 91 Cf. furthermore our remarks to Psa 18:15, and the comparative material listed there. 92 This is a legitimate approach in the realm of a bi-directional comparison.



302 6. WARRIOR AND Gon OF HEAVEN IN THE PSALMS AND ANE ICONOGRAPHY
Ishtar, Adad, or both can be seen in the context of an adoration scene. In cases, where the biblical text describes Yahweh with warrior attributes (and here lies the phenomenological connection to the armed god or goddess of ANE iconography), he is normally characterized as being actively involved in the actual attack on an enemy. The biblical imagery is never reduced to such a degree, that the warrior attributes become emblematic, as it is the case with the depictions found on the cylinder seals. Although Yahweh acts as a warrior he never becomes the warrior-god exclusively, he rather remains the supreme god displaying warrior characteristics, but not in the form of mere emblem which would designate him as the war-god.93 (2) Figures 48-53 show Ishtar, the goddess in the star nimbus. Although the motif has definite astral and cosmic connotations and thus incorporates god of heaven attributes, only the 'bright ones' in Psa 68:18 were able to furnish a biblical point of comparison for this imagery, although the connection is somewhat indirect and does not reflect the centrality the star nimbus has on the iconographic depictions. (3) In like manner, Figures 55-57 depict deities seated on a throne with stars attached to its back, viz., standing below a canopy ornamented with stars. 94 The imagery offers itself as an indication of the celestial throne and may be comparable to texts like Psa 11 :4 'The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven; his eyes behold, his eyelids test, the children of men' (RSV). However, within our selection oftexts the imagery did not play any significant role, representing a somewhat less dominant emphasis within the God of heaven and warrior metaphors.
93 This statement may also be applicable to other attributes: sun-god, weather-god, waterproviding god, etc.
94 Cf. also the depiction of Sama~ sitting enthroned in his temple (Keel, 1972:153, fig. 239).



7. CONCLUSIONS
To draw final conclusions from a multifaceted study like the present one, appears to be somewhat restrictive, since it cannot encompass all the aspects which were brought to the attention of the reader throughout the discussion of the topic. Bearing this in mind, an attempt will be made to highlight the most important areas touched upon, followed by a short outlook into the implications ofthe study on further research.1 (1) The importance ofthe study of metaphor from a modern linguistic and literary perspective lies in the fact that it has been demonstrated as a valuable tool in the deciphering of biblical metaphors, viz., metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter. Especially the concept of a hierarchical relationship between metaphor and submetaphor enables the researcher to organize the abundance of material into units and sub-units according to prior established criteria.2 lt has, however, been established that the demarcation lines between various metaphors cannot be understood as clear-cut, whereas no final understanding of a metaphor exists, and the interpretation or deciphering of a metaphor has always to remain tentative, subjected to further investigation. (2) Approaching the subject of metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter from a statistical perspective with the tools of modern metaphor theory, proved tobe an innovative enterprise, and to the knowledge ofthe author, a similar study has not been undertaken up to now. Although th~re cannot be the prerogative of comprehensiveness, the 507 occurrences of metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter isolated during the study provided a sound basis from which it was possible to glean important information with regard to the usage of metaphorical language in the psalter. Interestingly, the total
1 Although it is an academic practice to read the conclusion of a study as a pars pro toto for the rest ofthe discussion, it does not always present an overall picture ofthe work. If one endeavours to get a concise overview of the present study, the comparative discussion in chapter 6 offers itself as a more likely candidate than the conclusion.
2 Since the present study attempted a survey of metaphorical language about God in the whole of the Hebrew psalter, it was important to limit the criteria to a feasible amount which nevertheless would guarantee a uniform approach to the material. The criteria were: metaphor (the main metaphor class organized along similar principles as semantic domains) - submetaphor (the resulting sub-class of a metaphor; cf. a semantic subdomain) - type (the differentiation between an interactive, substitutionary, and ornamental metaphor) - category (the general organization of metaphors according to anthropomorphic, physiomorphic, or theriomorphic classes).



304 7. CONCLUSIONS
number of occurrences of metaphors could be organized into a proportionally small amount of 17 groups of main metaphors. This demonstrates that the biblical authors, at least the authors of the psalms, used a limited set of metaphors from which they were able to draw when intending to communicate certain attributes of God, although we would not agree with Brettler (1989:160) in trying to reduce metaphors of God to a single original root metaphor which would be the metaphor of God as king. Such a reductionistic approach does not take into consideration the wide range of biblical metaphors of God which at times are far-removed from the idea of God as king, although the God of heaven and warrior metaphors certainly show affinities to the idea of God as king, but also go clearly beyond its ramifications.3 The statistical evaluation of the survey established that metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter are predominantly of the interactive (79 %) type, supporting the notion that a metaphor cannot be understood as a rigidly defined entity, but that it is subjected to changes and demarcated by factors such as chronology and reception. lt is significant that the majority of metaphors depict God anthropomorphically (65 %), and although there is a hesitancy to elaborate on details in the anthropomorphic description of Yahweh, this category nevertheless constitutes the main communicant of metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter. While Yahweh usually remains the deus absconditus, his revelation in most cases proceeds along anthropomorphic lines. Focusing onto the God of heaven and warrior metaphors as the subject of the present study, it was established that both metaphors range relatively high on the scale of number of occurrences.4 In considering the distribution of these two metaphors within the Hebrew psalter, some tendencies could be observed. The number of occurrences decreases toward the end of the psalter, while the warrior metaphor on its own disappeared completely after Book 3 of the Hebrew psalter, and only occurred in a mixed form in combination with the God of heaven metaphor. Already during the statistical evaluation of the metaphors, it became increasingly difficult to differentiate between the two metaphors. Although
3 There always remains the tension between a reductionistic and atomistic approach. While the God of heaven and warrior metaphors can be correlated to the king metaphor, it would appear somewhat artificial to make all aspects of these metaphors fit into the scheme of God as king. Throughout the study, we have endeavoured to keep a balance between atomistic and reductionistic tendencies.
4 Neglecting the God's body metaphor on account of the disconnectedness and independence of its various submetaphors, the God of heaven metaphor constituted the main metaphor class with the most occurrences (18 %), whereas the warrior metaphor ranked fifth behind the God of heaven metaphor with an overall number of 8 % of the total occurrences.



7. CONCLUSIONS 305
we would not suggest that the God of heaven and warrior metaphors always occur in combination with each other, the overlapping, nevertheless, is taking place on such a scale that it would actually be possible to speak of only one metaphor. There are occurrences in which either warrior or God of heaven attributes dominate, but most occurrences feature both metaphors side by side, as we observed repeatedly during the exegetical part of the study. With regard to the decreasing frequency of the metaphor in the Hebrew psalter, we would like to make a cautious observation: as a compilation of hymns and songs, it is reasonable and possible to assume a rough chronological order for the Hebrew psalter. New or more recent poems would naturally be added at the end of the line, forming a certain time frequency from early to late in the order of Book 1-5 of the psalter.5 If one correlates the decreasing frequency of both metaphors, but especially of the warrior metaphor, it appears that the metaphor lost its popularity toward the end of the time period in which the Hebrew psalter was assembled. While Yahweh as God of heaven and warrior are strong and prominent themes throughout the first half or three-fifth of the psalter, its presence in the last part ofthe psalter (e.g., Psa 144) is found in the form of a re-use of older material with differing emphasis. (3) While the selection of texts for the exegetical part, and the accompanying limitation to eight psalms was motivated by the statistical evaluation of the survey of metaphors, it became clear from the outset that this would create a possible margin of texts which would be of relevance for this study, but which were not included in the selection of texts. Nevertheless, the eight psalms under consideration proved to be more than representative for the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, presenting a broad spectrum of meaning for the interpretation of the metaphors in the Hebrew psalter. Bypassing form-critical considerations to a large extent, the exegetical discussion concentrated on the individual significance and meaning of a respective psalm without trying to make it fit into an inflexible overall system.6 Adhering to a more conservative dating scheme, a chronological sequence for the psalms under discussion could be established, which roughly corresponded to their order of occurrence in the Hebrew psalter, ranging from the 10th to the 5th centuries B.C. (cf. note 5). However, the dating of the material was not a primary concem ofthe study,
5 This ·is by no means a closed system and there are certainly divergences from this scheme (e.g., in cases of thematically oriented groupings), but generally an overall progression from older to younger hyrnns appears to be demonstrable, especially with regard to the five traditional divisions.

306 7. CONCLUSIONS
but rather the relative sequence of the psalms for the reason of sketching a chronological development of the metaphors under question. Especially the theophanic event was demonstrated as being closely affiliated with the God ofheaven and warrior metaphors. However, while it may be correct that the God of the theophany appears as the God of heaven or as a warrior, the converse is not valid: God as God of heaven or as warrior does not always manifest himself by means of a theophany.7 Furthermore, it was established that the authors of the psalms used imagery common to their SyroPalestinian environment, it appeared at times that they would use their material and adapt it to their specific purposes which were repeatedly shown to be of an exclusive Israelite character, e.g., the Palestinian geography in Psa 65, or the polemic nature of Psa 68. Nevertheless, beyond Israelite interests, there was a frequent universal inclination in the description of the metaphor. while Yahweh remains the warrior fighting from heaven, he nevertheless does that on a universal scale, ultimately bringing peace and prosperity, first to Palestine (Psa 65), but beyond that to the whole earth (Psa 46). We would suggest that the notion of Yahweh fighting from heaven on behalf of Israel lies at the core of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, but the imagery is not limited to this notion, and often goes beyond it in a surprising fashion. Yahweh as the warrior from heaven is always depicted as being in ultimate control, and his supremacy is continuously emphasized. He is not engaged in a struggle against the chaos or the enemy, but his victory is an anticipated fact and his dominion over the chaotic forces afait accompli. (4) The iconographic objects were organized into three groups, i.e., depictions of gods or goddesses displaying warrior attributes, those with god of heaven attributes, and a group manifesting attributes which are reflective of both metaphors. In trying to generalize some tendencies within the corpus of iconographic sources, a number of peculiarities become apparent.8 The more aggressive or active depictions, i.e., gods or goddesses involved in some form of warlike scenes like the smiting god or the god
7 lt would be interesting to re-evaluate Jeremias' study on the Gattung oftheophany in the OT (1965; cf. also Hunter, 1987 and 1989) with regard to the outcome of this study, since it has been demonstrated that the God of heaven and warrior metaphors form an integral part of the theophanic event, thus enlarging the scope of the theophany significantly.
8 The tendencies isolated here, are, of course, in the form of generalizations that may
overlook individual images which do not confirm to the outlined characteristics. lt is here that the dialogue with Keel and Uehlinger (1992) is to be sought, while similar developments from a more aggressive iconography toward dominance-oriented depictions of ANE gods in the Palestinian area during the time period under question can be observed (1992:459-467).



7. CONCLUSIONS 307
with the spear motif groups are usually dating from the beginning of the time period under consideration or even from the marginal time period before that which has also been taken into consideration. They are generally weil represented in the Syro-Palestinian area, and can be associated with gods provenant in this region, i.e., Ba'al, Reshef, or the Egyptianizing Ba'al Seth. The god of heaven iconography is normally represented by Neo-Assyrian glyptic with a variety of motif groups falling under this category. Iconographic sources displaying god of heaven attributes can roughly be dated between the 10th and 5th centuries B.C., whereas part of the evidence stems from sites outside Palestine, or sites without known provenance. Most of the motif groups are represented in the Syro-Palestinian area, at least with a small number of specimen.9 However, some motif groups falling under this category, are not represented at all in Syro-Palestine (e.g., the water-providing god), while others experienced a wide distribution in this region (e.g., the winged sphinx motif group). The third category of images, i.e., the group displaying both attributes in a mixed form, centered around the depiction of the weather-god with the bundle of lightning in an aggressive posture. This image possibly epitomizes the thrust of the present discussion in the most impressive way, i.e., the god fighting from heaven in using meteorological weapons. The object ofthe god's aggression, when present in the depiction, was normally in the form of an equation between chaotic forces and human enemies. In cases where no antagonistic entity was present, the imagery at times appeared to be reduced to an emblematic or symbolic statement, designating a goddess or god as a certain type of deity (e.g., water-god, storm-god, etc.). Furthermore, the provisional character of these designations for the various gods was repeatedly noted. A deity in ANE iconography should be described according to its function and attributes, whereas the nomenclature is of relative importance.10
9 From the total number of iconographic objects collected for this study, about one third has been found on Syro-Palestinian sites with a verified archaeological background.
Although one has to keep these limitations in mind with regard to far-reaching conclusions, it appears permissible to outline certain tendencies which could be . established throughout the iconographic discussion. We normally endeavoured to include at least one representative of a respective motif group originating from a SyroPalestinian site.
1° Keel and Uehlinger rightly observe: "Namen geben über das Wesen der angesprochenen
und verehrten Gottheiten meist nur sehr allgemeine oder gar keine Auskunft. Sie lassen sich wie Etiketten aufkleben. Die ägyptische Baumgöttin z.B., die auf Bildern der 18.21. Dynastie neben dem Grab des oder der Verstorbenen zu sehen ist, trägt entweder keinen Namen, oder sie kann mit ganz verschiedenen Namen bezeichnet werden (Nut, · Neith, Isis, Ma'at usw.) [sie] Ihre Erscheinungsweise und Funktion ist aber immer die gleiche. Die Identität einer Gottheit haftet nur zu einem kleinen Teil oder gar nicht an



308 7. CONCLUSIONS
(5) In comparing the biblical texts with the iconographic images, a number of parallels but also contrasts were established which have been summarized in the preceding chapter. On the whole it appears that the authors of the eight psalms discussed during this study, utilized imagery which was familiar to them from their general Syro-Palestinian environment, and which can be related to iconographic sources reflecting such imagery. However, one can by no means talk of a one-to-one relationship, establishing a simple line of dependency. There are distinct contrasts and variations of motif on such a scale that one is compelled to assume a certain adaptation of the iconographic material in accordance with the intentions of the respective psalmist. In interpreting such a state of affairs we would assume that the biblical author utilized imagery familiar to him from his Syro-Palestinian, viz., ANE general background, and applied them to Yahweh. During this process, a number of adaptations took place, and familiar iconographic motifs were filled with new contents as they appeared in literary form in the psalm. The motivation for such a practice would be the demonstration of a superiority of Yahweh over against the ANE pantheon (cf. especially Psa 68), a notion which is clearly monotheistic in orientation.11 According to the authors of our selection of psalms, Yahweh takes on attributes familiar from other gods of the ANE, but he never does so in a static way, he is not restricted by them, and they do not become his emblems, designating him as the weather-god, as the war-god, or any other type of god per se. He rather fills them with a new or slightly differing content and goes beyond them, which serves to create the dichotomy between the one God and the many gods. Thus Yahweh always remains the totaliter aliter.
ihrem Namen. Ihr Wesen kommt in ihren Funktionen und Rollen viel treffender zum Ausdruck" (1992:453f.; cf. also Keel, 1992b:91-95). One wonders ifthe evaluation of divine names for the God ofthe Bible should not be reconsidered along these lines.
11 Touching on the current widely discussed question of Israelite monotheism, we would suggest that this tendency of re-utilization in the application of extra-biblical imagery in the psalms under discussion creates the polarized dichotomy between Yahweh and the gods which lies at the center of the comparative approach in biblical studies. Stolz observes: "Jedenfalls ist eine typische Vergleichsanlage hergestellt: Der Vergleich zwischen Israel und seiner Umwelt ist asymmetrisch. Was Israel auszeichnet, ist, letztlich jedenfalls, der Monotheismus; ebenso kennzeichnend für seine Umgebung ist der Polytheismus, wobei der letztere Ausdruck ja nur auf dem Hintergrund des ersteren zu verstehen ist: Die Vielheit der Götter wird erst auffällig als Hintergrund zu dem einen Gott..." (1994:39). Space prohibits an adequate discussion; for a comprehensive introduction into the present discussion, cf. the various articles in Dietrich and Klopfenstein (1994).



7. CONCLUSIONS 309
(6) Concluding a discussion on God as the warrior fighting from heaven, a number of questions have to remain open which may serve as incentive for future investigation: First: Would the picture remain the same if one would broaden the research limitations and include more biblical texts and iconographic sources? Throughout the study, we attempted to keep the motivation for the selection of texts and images as transparent as possible, following what seemed to us the most rational way of proceeding. But a selection always remains susceptible to being a one-sided or few-sided representation of the actual complete picture.12 How would the outcome of the project change, if one would include epigraphic material?13 Second: A significant part of the comparative material was found on cylinder seals both in and outside of Syro-Palestine, however, with a NeoAssyrian background dating from the 9th to the 7th centuries B.C. Is it possible to draw any conclusions from that with regard to the dating of various psalms within the Hebrew psalter? Third: God as the warrior fighting from heaven remains one of the less comfortable Gottesbilder regarded from a modern theological perspective. Nevertheless, it appears to constitute an important part of the imagery associated with Yahweh throughout the Hebrew psalter. Even more so, because it reappears in the literature of the New Testament as part of the apocalyptic vision given to John in Rev 19:11-15: 'Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! He who sat upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has a name inscribed which no one knows but himself. He is clad in a rohe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, followed him on white horses. From his mouth issues a sharp sword with which to smite the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty' (RSV). How can such imagery adequately be integrated into theological conceptions about God? Perhaps in the way of the ultimate motivation which may be found at the core of the God of heaven and warrior metaphors as reflected in Psa 46: 1Of.: 'He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow,
12 Working with metaphors, however, one may not ever be able to create a complete picture. This also applies to the steadily increasing amount of iconographic images which may have been relevant for the present discussion.

and shatters the spear, he bums the chariots with fire! Be still, and know that I am God. I am exalted among the nations, I am exalted in the earth!' (RSV).

Summary
Based on a comprehensive survey of metaphors of God in the Hebrew psalter, a total number of 507 occurrences are identified in which God is described by means of a metaphor. Applying modern metaphor theory, these occurrences are classified according to their main metaphor, submetaphor, metaphor type, and metaphor category. lt is shown, that a proportionally small number of 17 main metaphor groups with their respective submetaphors exist which describe Yahweh in mostly anthropomorphic categories. Focusing on the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, a group of eight psalms is selected which display a recurrence of the two metaphors: Psa 18, 21, 29, 46, 65, 68, 83, and 144. Each psalm is discussed according to its transmitted text, semantic peculiarities, and literary structures, followed by short comments on the passage. lt appears that the authors of the psalms under consideration used imagery familiar to them from their Syro-Palestinian background, but adapted and shaped it accordingly to their literary intentions in the form of an interpretatio lsraelitica. The notion of Yahweh fighting as a warrior from heaven on behalf of his people encompasses the spectrum of meaning for the God of heaven and warrior metaphors in the most comprehensive way. In the iconographic part of the study, the visual sources are presented in three groups, i.e., depictions of gods or goddesses displaying warrior attributes, those with god of heaven attributes, and a group manifesting attributes which are reflective of both imageries. A total number of 93 images are presented of which approximately one-third come from Syro-Palestinian archaeological sites. lt is noted that the more aggressive depictions of gods can generally be associated with earlier time periods and are weil represented in Syro-Palestine. As the most prolific source for iconographic images reflecting the God of heaven and warrior metaphors, the Neo-Assyrian glyptic of the 9th-7th centuries can be established. In comparing the two bodies of evidence, it appears that the biblical authors employed metaphors reflecting motifs from ANE iconography, although it is not possible to speak of a one-to-one relationship. Rather, the reutilization and adaptation of the imagery and its ascription to Yahweh demonstrates the tendency to indicate the superiority of Yahweh over the deities of the ANE in a strong monotheistic fashion.
