மறவாலம நவண்டும் , இன்னும் நவண்டும் ான் மகிழ்ந்து பாடி
அறவா ீ ஆடும் நபாதுஉன் அடியின்கீழ் இருக்க என்றார் .

do not want to forget You forever; if I do, I want to be happily singing in Your praise
under Your feet as You are dancing”.

[quote]Amritaghatesvara temple
At Melakkadambur, there is a Siva temple which is at least as old as
the days of the Tamil saint Appar of the 7th century a.d. He has sung
hymns on this Lord. He called the place Tirukka-dambur and the
temple here Karakkoyil. According to local tradition, Indra is said to
have worshipped the Lord here and obtained nectar; hence the temple
has the alternate current name of Amritaghatesvaram. A fragmentary
inscription found on one of the slabs used in the pavement of
the prakara of this temple gives Kadambur the alternate name of
Uttama Chola chaturvedi-mangalam (ARE 112 of 1946-47). Thus, it
is clear that a temple was in existence at the site even during the Early
Chola period...Jnana Dakshinamurti: This image of Siva is placed in
the southern koshta of the garbhagriha. Siva sits under a spreading
tree, his right leg resting on his left thigh. He wears a and the matted
ends of his locks fall on both sides of his head. His front right hand is
in the chinmudra pose, and he holds a puslaka, a sarpa and agni in his
other hands. Nandi is to the proper right, and the Apasmara-purusha is
pressed down under the right foot. [unquote] Source: Later Chola

[quote]Abstract This paper explores the origins of the Nataraja cult in the state of Tamil
Nadu in southern India. The trajectory of the dancing Shiva is traced: from the
processional worship of metal icons outside the sanctum to the cultic elevation of the
Nataraja bronze into the sanctum at Chidambaram. Archaeometallurgical, iconographic
and literary evidence discussed shows that the Nataraja bronze, depicting Shiva’s
anandatandava or ‘dance of bliss’, was a Pallava innovation (seventh to mid-ninth
century), rather than tenth-century Chola as widely believed. That this formulation was
informed of ‘cosmic’ or metaphysical connotations is also argued on the basis of the
testimony of the hymns of Tamil saints. [unquote]
The paper argues a metaphorical interpretation of the icon, linked to the cosmic dance and the consciousness.

What is the meaning of your Lord,
standing as a pillar of fire,
reaching from the nether regions to the sky,
that Brahma and Vishnu may not know Him?
reaching from the nether regions to the skies,
had he not stood so,
both of them on account of their altercation between them,
would never have shed their egotism...
He who creates, protects, and destroys the verdant world,
The primeval One. . .
“The c. sixth-century CE Tamil poetess and saint Karaikkal Ammaiyar, who is said to
have prayed to Shiva to be turned from a beautiful woman into a hag (Prentiss 2003: 28),
also provides a striking allegory for release from vanity and egotism.” ibid. (Sharada
Srinivasan)

O unique consciousness (or uṇarve),
which is realised (uṇarvatu) as standing firm,
transcending words and (ordinary) consciousness (uṇarvu),
O let me know a way to tell of You. (22: 3) –Manikkavachakar

[quote]Conclusion Processional icons of dancing Shiva and the Nataraja worshipped at Chidambaram
until Mahendravarman Pallavan’s time (c. AD 600 – 30) were probably of wood. A switch to metal
processional icons was made by at least Paramesvaravarman I’s time (c. AD 650) from the Kuram
copper plate and dates from archaeometallurgical finger-printing for the Shiva Natesa from Kuram
(Plate 2), while Appar’s seventh-century verses leave open the possibility of the worship of a Shiva
Nataraja bronze at Chidambaram. Finger-printing supports a Pallava attribution, c. AD 800 – 50, for
two Nataraja bronzes (Plates 3 and 4), fitting dates for Dantivarman Pallava under whom karanas of
Shiva’s anandatandava were sculpted at Bahur. This coincides not only with dates for
Manikkavachakar’s mystical hymns, evoking Nataraja as the elements and the one consciousness
(Tamil: ‘or unarve’), Shiva as ‘cosmic dancer’ 447 but also for Sankara, c. AD 800, whose monistic
doctrines might also have had a bearing. Setting aside the odd flattish stone frieze, sizeable well
rounded stone Natarajas emerged later than the metal icon, and specifically under the reign of Chola
queen Sembiyan Mahadevi (c. AD 950). [unquote] (Srinivasan, S. 2004. Shiva as cosmic dancer: On
