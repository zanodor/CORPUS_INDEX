Why does Slovakia have double crosses?
, knows Hungarian
Answered 59m ago
Slovakia is using the Hungarian coat of arms exactly what the Hungarian country is already using 1000 years long for the full area of the Hungarian Kingdom not only for North Hungary: Double cross (top part is shorter) + trimount in a shield.
Slovakia exists only since 1993, before the 20th century the region of today Slovakia is called "North Hungary" or "Upper Land". If you see the history and historical maps you will not see Slovakia in the past. After World War 1 in 1920, the Entente gave unjustly north Hungary from the 1000 years old Hungarian Kingdom to the Czech state to create Czechoslovakia. The new borders were arbitrary and unjust so the new borders did not follow the historical and ethnic territories. In this way, 900 000 Hungarians + 200 000 Germans moved under the Czechoslovak rule, while on that territory was 1,7 million Slovaks (58% Slovak - 42% non-Slovak). This artificial state already collapsed, so the full territory of today Slovakia was part of the Hungarian Kingdom 1000 years long.

Hungarian medieval coins. We can see Hungary is using the double cross as a state symbol in every Hungarian coin and we can see the development of the coat of arms.

King Bela III of Hungary was the heir of the Byzantine Empire, and the Byzantine Empire also used the double cross. There were many connections between the Hungarian royal family and the Byzantine royal family.
Saint Irene of Hungary (1088-1134) was a Byzantine empress, she was the daughter of Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary. She and John II Komnenos had eight children. She was the mother of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos and the grandmother of the Byzantine emperor Alexios II Komnenos.
Margaret of Hungary (1175-1223) was a Byzantine empress, she was the daughter of Béla III of Hungary. She was the sister of Andrew II of Hungary who led the biggest crusader army ever.
Anna of Hungary (1260-1281) was a Byzantine empress, she was the daughter of Stephen V of Hungary and the granddaughter of Bela IV of Hungary. Anna married Andronikos II Palaiologos, every Palaiologos emperor to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 descended from her through her son Michael.

Gyergyószentmiklós (Gheorgheni), an 85% Hungarian-populated old Hungarian city in Transylvania. This is far from Upper Hungary, but we can see the double cross symbol in the town hall.

David, regardless of how many millions of proof we provide (for Rumanians, Hottentottians, Martians, etc.), didn’t you know that the Slavic versions were “somehow” still originals? Like our sacred words that ignorant people on Satan’s payroll gave away. For example ösztörű. A very fitting word (I was just looking at in my notes), given the subject. From Slavic ostrva, of course. Compare Old Greek stauros = cross (used for crucifixion) (word used in Greek Bible). The cross was always looked upon as the World Tree. The Hungarian double-cross has the meaning “One” [Gy < Egy]. The three mounds relate to country or place of origin (known by aboriginal people worldwide as the 3 belt stars of Orion, built in several places around the world by peoples preceding Slavs, Rumanians, Latins, Jews, etc.). I mean, for how long can humanity take being short-changed and being sold the worldview of idiots? We the people are not idiots. Especially us Magyars.
