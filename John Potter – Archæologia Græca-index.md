In this edition - which the Publishers have been induced
to undertake by the success of a previous attempt to
render more popular Dr Adam's excellent ‘ Summary of
Roman Antiquities ' - much additional and valuable matter
has been introduced , in the form of notes and appendices,
from the writings of Heeren, Boeckh, Cramer, Leake,
Mitchell, Sandford, Cardwell, Müller, and others, and from
several anonymous sources ; plans and illustrations have
been borrowed from Meyrick , Moses, Montfaucon, Hope,
Stuart, and Revett, and other works of acknowledged
merit ; the style of the Author has in numerous instances
been altered , and, it is hoped , improved ; many of the
authorities have been verified by a reference to the best
editions of the classics ; the Indices have been enlarged ;
and the two volumes of the original have been reduced, by
the use of a smaller type, and by the omission or curtail
ment of the quotations with which they were overloaded ,
to one cheap and portable volume.
With what measure of taste and judgment these altera tions and additions have been made it is not for the Pub
lishers to say. They trust that they have at least succeeded,
by the reduction of the size and price of the work, in
removing what have hitherto been the great obstacles to
its admission into many of our classical Institutions.

ARCHÆOLOGIA
GRÆCA
;
OR , THE
ANTIQUITIES OF GREECE .
BOOK 1.-CHAP. I.
OF THE STATE OF ATHENS TILL CECROPS .
All ages have had a great esteem and veneration for antiquity; and not only of men , but of families, cities, and countries, the most ancient have
always been accounted the most honourable . Hence arose one of the first and most universal disputes that ever troubled mankind ; almost every nation , whose origin was not very manifest, pretending to have
been of an equal duration with the earth itself. Thus the Egyptians, Scythians, and Phrygians, fancied themselves to be the first race of man
kind ; and the Arcadians boasted that they were a goobanyou, or before the, muon . The want of letters contributed not a little to these opinions ; for
almost every colony and plantation , wanting means whereby to preserve the memory of their ancestors, and deliver them down to posterity, in a
few generations forgot their mother nation , and thought they had inhabited their own country from the beginning of the world . Our Athenians, too, had their share in this vanity, and made as great and loud pretensions to antiquity as the best of their neighbours: they
gave out that they were produced at the same time with the sun , assumed to themselves the honourable name ( for so they thought it) of
Avróxborss, which word signifies persons produced out of the same soil that
they inhabit ; for it was an old opinion , and almost everywhere received among the vulgar, that in the beginning of the world, men, like plants, were, by some strange prolific virtue, produced out of the fertile womb of
one common mother, earth ; and therefore the ancients generally called themselves Inyertīs, sons of the earth. Alluding to the same original, the Athenians sometimes styled themselves Tirtiyes, grasshoppers ; and
some of them were grasshoppers of golcombinding them in their hair, as badges of honour, and marks to distinguish them from others of later
duration and less noble extraction , because those insects were believed to be generated out of the ground.3 Without doubt the Athenians were a
very ancient nation , and it may be, the first that ever inhabited that

country ; for while Thessaly and Peloponnesus, and almost all the fertile
regions of Greece, changed their old masters every year, the barrenness of Attica secured its inhabitants from foreign invasions. Greece at that time had no constant and settled inhabitants, but there were continual
removes, the stronger always dispossessing the weaker; and therefore they lived , as we say , from hand to mouth , and provided no more than what
was necessary for present sustenance, expecting every day when some more powerful nation should come and displace them, in the same manner as they themselves had done their predecessors.' Amidst all these troubles
and tumults, Attica lay secure and unmolested, being protected from foreign enemies by means of a craggy and unfruitful soil, that could not
afford fuel for contention ; and secured from intestine and civil broils by the quiet and peaceable dispositions of its inhabitants ; for, in these golden
days, no affectation of supremacy, nor any sparks of ambition , had fired men's minds, but every one lived full of content and satisfaction in the
enjoyment of an equal share of land, and other necessaries, with the rest of his neighbours.
The usual attendants of a long and uninterrupted peace, are riches and plenty ; but in those days, when men lived upon the products of their own soil, and had not found out the way of supplying their wants by traffic,
the case was quite contrary, and peace was only the mother of poverty and scarceness, producing a great many new mouths to consume, but affording no new supplies to satisfy them . This was soon experienced by the Athenians ; for in a few ages they were increased to such a num ber, that their country , being not only unfruitful, but confined within very
narrow bounds, was no longer able to furnish them with necessary pro visions. This forced them to contrive some means to disburden it ; and
therefore they sent out colonies to provide new habitations, which spread themselves in the several parts of Greece .
This sending forth of colonies was very frequent in the first ages of the world , and several instances there are of it in later times, especially amongst the Gauls and Scythians, who often left their native countries in
vast bodies, and, like general inundations, overturned all before them .
Meursius reckons to the number of forty plantations peopled by. Athenians; but, amongst them all there was none so remarkable as that in Asia
Minor, which they called by the name of their native country, Ionia.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS, 3
! -
For the primitive Athenians were named Iones, and laones ; and hence it came to pass, that there was a very near affinity between the Attic and
old Ionic dialect, as Eustathius a observes. And though the Athenians thought fit to lay aside their ancient name, yet it was not altogether out
of use in Theseus' reign , as appears from the pillar erected by him in the isthmus, to show the bounds of the Athenians on the one side, and the
Peloponnesians on the other ; on the east side of which was this inscrip tion ; : • This is not Peloponnesus, but Ionia ;' and on the south side this: ? This is not Ionja, but Peloponnesus.' This name is thought to have
been given them from Javan, which bears a near resemblance to ' Iéwro and much nearer , if (as grammarians tell us) the ancient Greeks pronounced
the letter a broad , like the diphthong 'æv, as in our English word all ; and so Sir George Wheeler reports the modern Greeks do at this day. This
Javan was the fourth son of Japheth, and is said to have come into Greece after the confusion of Babel, and seated himself in Attica . And this report receives no small confirmation from the divine writings, where the name of Javan is in several places put for Greece. Two instances
we have in Daniel;" • And when I am gone forth , behold, the Prince of Græcia shall come.' 5. He shall stir up all against the realm of Græcia .'
And again in Isaiah , ' And I will send those that escape of them to the nations in the sea in Italy, and in Greece. Where the Tigurine version . with that of Geneva, retains the Hebrew words, and uses the names of
Tubal and Javan , instead of Italy and Greece. But the Grecians them selves having no knowledge of their true ancestor, make this nameto be of much later date, and derive it from Ion the son of Xuthus. This
Xuthus (as Pausanias reports) having robbed his father Deucalion of his treasure, conveyed himself, together with his ill -gotten wealth , into
Attica, which was at that time governed by Erechtheus, who courteously entertained him , and gave him his daughter in marriage, by whom he had two sons, Ion and Achæus, the former of which gave his name to

the Ionians, the latter to the Achæans. It is not improbable that Ion himself might receive his name from Javan, it being a custom observable
in the histories of all times, to keep up the ancient name of a forefather, especially such as had been eminent in the times he lived in, by reviving it in some of the principal of his posterity .
From the first peopling of Attica till the time of king Ogyges, we have no account of any thing that passed there ; only Plato reports, they had a tradition , that the Athenian power and glory were very great in those
days; that they were excellently skilled both in civil and military affairs, were governed by the justest and most equitable laws, and lived in far greater splendour than they had arrived to in his time. But of the
transactions of these and the following ages till Theseus, or the Trojan war , little or nothing of certainty must be expected ; partly, because of the want of records, in rude and illiterate ages ; partly, by reason of the
vast distance of time, wherein those records they had (if they had any )
were lost and destroyed ; and partly through the pride and vain -glory of the ancient Greeks, who, out of an affectation of being thought to have been descended from some divine original, industriously concealed their
pedigrees, and obscured their ancient histories with idle tales, and poetical fictions. To use the words of Plutarch ,2 « As historians in their geogra phical descriptions of countries, crowd into the farthest part of their maps
those things they have no knowledge of, with some such remarks in the
margin as these : “ all beyond is nothing but dry and desert sands, or Scythian cold, or a frozen sea : ' so it may very well be said of those things that are so far removed from our age ; all beyond is nothing but monstrous and tragical fictions; there the poets, and there the inventors of fables
dwell ; nor is there to be expected any thing that deserves credit, or that carries in it any appearance of truth .' However I must not omit what is reported concerning Ogyges, or Ogygus, whom some will have to have been king of Thebes, some of Egypt, some of Arcadia, but others of Attica, which is said to have been
called after his name Ogygia . He is reported to have been a very potent prince, and the founder of several cities, particularly Eleusis ; and
Pausanias tells us farther, that he was father to the hero Eleusis, from whom that town received its name. He is said to have been contemporary
with the patriarch Jacob ; about the sixty -seventh year of whose age he is supposed to have been born ;4 others bring him as low as Moses. His
reign is the utmost period the Athenian stories or traditions ever pretended
to reach to ; and therefore when they would express the great antiquity of any thing, they call it árúrysos, of this we have a great many instances

And in allusion to the great power he is supposed to have been possessed of, they call any thing great or potent, wyúyros, as two learned gramma
rians inform us: Hesychius , Ωγυγίου παλαιού, αρχαίου, μεγάλου πάνυ . Suidas , ' Ωγύγιον παλαιών, ή υπερμεγεθές. And therefore yúzsa xarà are great and insupportable evils ; and wyúysos sumosia , in Philo, extreme folly and stupidity . He reigned two- and -thirty years ( for so Cedrenus com
putes them ) in full power and prosperity, and blessed with the affluence
of all things that fortune can bestow upon her greatest favourites : but the
conclusion of his life was no less deplorable than the former part of it had been prosperous ; for in the midst of all his enjoyments, he was surprised with a sudden and terrible inundation , which overwhelmed not Attica
only, but all Achaia too, in one common destruction .' There is frequent mention made in ancient authors of several kings that reigned in Attica between the Ogygian flood and Cecrops I .: as
of Porphyrion, concerning whom the Athmonians, a people in Attica, have a tradition , that he erected a temple to Venus Ougavíc in their borough . Also of Colanus ; and of Periphas, who is described by
Antonius Liberalis, to have been a very virtuous prince, and at last
metamorphosed into an eagle. Isaac Tzetzes, in his comment upon
Lycophron , speaks of one Draco, out of whose teeth, he tells us, it was reported that Cecrops sprung ; and this reason some give for his being
called Aspuns. Lastly, Pausanias and Stephanus speak of Actæus, or Actæon , from whom some will have Attica to have been called Acte; and
this name frequently occurs in the poets, particularly in Lycophron, a studious affecter of antiquated names and obsolete words. But small credit is to be given to these reports ; for we are assured by Philochorus, an author of no less credit than antiquity , as he is quoted by Africanus, that Attica was so much wasted by the Ogygian deluge, and
its inhabitants reduced to so small a number, that they lived a hundred and ninety years, from the time of Ogyges to Cecrops, without any king
at all ; and Eusebius concurs with him in this opinion.

of

,

took
upon

the
title
of
king
.
Most
nations
at
the

were
governed
by
kings
,
who
were
usually
persons
of
great
worth
and
renown
;
and
for
their
courage
,
prudence
,
and
other
virtues,
promoted
to
that
dignity
by
the
general
consent

of
the
people
,
who
yielded
them
obedience
out
of
willingness
rather
than

,

and

of
their

,
and
fitness
to

,
than
by
the
force
of
their
arms
,
or
from
a
slavish
fear
of
their
power
.
They
affected
no
uncontrollable
dominion
,
or
absolute
sway
,
but
preferred
the
good
of
their
people
,
for
whose
protection
they
knew
and
acknowledged
themselves
to
have
been
advanced
,
before
any
covetous
or
ambitious
designs
of
their
own
.
They
expected
no

,
no

faces
,
but
would
condescend
to
converse
familiarly
,
even
with
the
meaner
sort
of
their
subjects
,
as
oft
as
they
stood
in
need
of
their
assistance
.
In

,
they
endeavoured
to
observe
such
a
just
medium
in
their
behaviour
,
and
all
their
actions
,
as
might
neither
expose
their
authority
to
contempt
,
nor
render
them
formidable
to
those
,
whom
they
chose
rather
to
win
by
kindness
into
a
voluntary
compliance
,
than
to
awe
by
severity
into
a
forced
subjection
.
They
proposed
to
themselves
no
other
advantage
than
the
good
and
welfare
of
their
people
;
and
made
use
of
their
authority
no
farther
,
than
as
it
was
conducive
and
necessary
to
that
end
.
Their
dignity
and
office
consisted
chiefly
in
these
things
:
,
1. In doing justice, in hearing causes , in composing the divisions,
and deciding the differences that happened among their subjects ; in con stituting new laws, and regulating the old, where they had any ;' but the people generally reposed such confidence in the justice and equity of
their prince, that his will and pleasure passed for law amongst them .? 2. In leading them to the wars ; where they did not only assist
them by their good conduct and management of affairs, but exposed their own persons for the safety and honour of their country, pressing forward
into the thickest of their enemies, and often encountering the most
valiant of them in single combat. And this they thought a principal part of their duty, judging it but reasonable, that they who excelled others in
honour, should surpass them too in valour ; and they that had the first places at all feasts and public assemblies, should be the first also in under
taking dangers, and exposing themselves in the defence of their country ;
(thus the hero in Homer argues the case with one of his fellow -princes:
Γλαύκε , τίη δη νωι τετιμημεσθα μάλιστα
3. The performance of the solemn sacrifices, and the care of divine worship, was part of the king's business. The Lacedemonian kings
at their coronation were consecrated priests of Jupiter Ougénios, and

:

We seldom meet with a sacrifice in Homer, but some of the heroes, and
those the chief of all then present, are concerned in the performance of
the holy ceremonies ; and so far was it from being thought an act of con descension , or any way below their dignity and grandeur, that they thought it an accession to the rest of their honours; and the inferior wor
shippers were no less careful to reserve this piece of service for them,
than they were to give them the most honourable places at the banquets,
with which they refreshed themselves after the sacrifices were ended. Let us now return to Cecrops, whom , as soon as he had established himself in his new -raised kingdom , we shall find employed in laying the model of a city, which he designed for the seat of his government and
place of his constant residence . And at the most commodious place in his dominions for this purpose, he pitched upon a rock, strongly fortified
by nature against any assaults, and situated in a large plain near the
middle of Attica, calling both the city, and the territory round it, after his own name, Cecropia. Afterwards, when the Athenians increased in
power and number, and filled the adjacent plains with buildings, this was the acropolis or citadel.

But the soil being in its own nature unfruitful, and the people unskilled
in tilling and improving it to the best advantage, such multitudes could not have failed of being reduced, in a short time, to the greatest extremi
ties, had not Cecrops taught them the art of navigation , and thereby supplied them with corn from Sicily and Africa.3
Besides this, he was the author of many excellent laws and constitu
tions, especially touching marriage, which, according to his appointment, was only to be celebrated betwixt one man and one woman , whereas be fore promiscuous mixtures had been allowed amongst them .

respect to one another, but he was the first that introduced a form of
religion, erected altars in honour of the gods, and instructed his people in what manner they were to worship them.
In the reign of Pandion , the fifth king of Athens, Triptolemus is said to have taught the Athenians how to sow and manure the ground, and to have enacted several useful and necessary laws, three of which we find
quoted by Porphyryl out of Xenocrates :-1. Honour your parents. 2. Make oblations of your fruits to the gods. 3. Hurt not living creatures.
Cecrops, the second of that name, and the seventh king of Athens, divided his dominions into twelve cities, or large boroughs, compelling
; his subjects to leave their separate habitations, and unite together for the replenishing of them . ” Their names were these, as they are delivered
by Strabo in his description of Attica :: Cecropia, Tetrapolis, Exacria ,
Decelea, Eleusis, Aphidnæ, Thoricus, Brauron , Cytheris, Sphettus, Ce phissa, and Phalerus. But Cecropia still continued the chief seat of the
empire, though each of these cities (they are the words of Sir George
Wheeler, who refers this division to Cecrops I., led thereunto by the authority of Eusebius and some others) had distinct courts of judica ture, and magistrates of their own ; and were so little subject to their princes, the successors of Cecrops, that they seldom or never had recourse
to them, save only in cases of imminent and public danger ; and did so absolutely order their own concerns, that sometimes they waged war against each other without the advice or consent of their kings.
In this state continued Attica, till the reign of Pandion, the second of that name, and eighth king of the Athenians, who was deprived of his
kingdom by the sons of his uncle Metion ; who themselves did not long possess what they had thus unjustly gotten, being driven out of it by the
more powerful arms of Pandion's four sons, viz. Ægeus, Lycus, Pallas, and Nisus. These having expelled the Metionidæ , divided the kingdom amongst themselves, as Apollodorus reports. But others are of opinion that Pandion himself being restored to the quiet possession of his kingdom
by the joint assistance of them all, by his last will and testament divided
it into four parts, bequeathing to each of them his proportion. And though it is not agreed amongst ancient writers, which part fell to each
man’s lot ; yet this much is consented to on all hands, that the sovereignty of Athens was assigned to Ægeus, for which he was extremely envied by his brethren ; and so much the more, because , as most think , he was not the begotten, but only adopted son of Pandion ; and for this reason it was
( says Plutarch), that Ægeus commanded Æthra, the mother of Theseus,
to send her son , when arrived at man's estate, from Trezen , the place
where he was born , to Athens, with all secrecy, and to enjoin him to conceal, as much as possible, his journey from all men, because he feared extremely the Pallantidæ , who continually mutinied against him, and despised him for his want of children, they themselves being fifty bro 1 De Abstineut. ab Animal. iy.

thers, all the sons of Pallas. However, as the same author tells us, they were withheld from breaking out into open rebellion , by the hopes and expectation of recovering the kingdom , at least after Ægeus' death, because he was without issue ; but as soon as Theseus appeared, and was acknowledged rightful successor to the crown , highly resenting, that first
Ægeus, Pandion's son only by adoption, and not at all related to the
family of Erechtheus, and then Theseus, one of another country , and a perfect stranger to their nation, should obtain the kingdom of their ances
tors, they broke out into open acts of hostility ; but were soon overcome and dispersed by the courage and conduct of Theseus.
Theseus having delivered the country from intestine seditions, pro ceeded in the next place to free it from foreign slavery. The Athenians
having barbarously murdered Androgeus, the son of Minos, king of Crete, were obliged by his father to send a novennial, or septennial, or ,
according to others, an annual tribute of seven young men, and as many virgins, into Crete, where they were shut up within the labyrinth, and there wandered about, till finding no possible means of making their escape , they perished with hunger, or else were devoured by the Minotaur,
a terrible monster, compounded of the different shapes of man and bull.
The time of sending this tribute being come, Theseus put himself amongst the youths that were doomed to go to Crete, where, having
arrived , he received of Ariadne, the daughter of king Minos, who had fallen in love with him, a clew of thread, and being instructed by her in
the use of it, which was to conduct him through all the windings of the labyrinth , escaped out of it, having first slain the Minotaur, and so re
turned with his fellow -captives in triumph to Athens. On his return , through an excess of joy for the happy success of his voyage, he forgot to hang out the white sail, which should have been the token of their safety to Ægeus, who sat expecting them upon the top of a
rock ; and as soon as their ship came in view with a black, and as it were, mourning sail, knowing nothing of their success, he threw himself
headlong into the sea, and so made way for Theseus' more early succes
sion to the crown , than could otherwise have been expected. And to this time, from the reign of Cecrops I., the government and state of Athens continued with little alteration .
CHAP. III.
OF THE STATE OF ATHENS FROM THESEUS TO THE DECENNIAL ARCHONS.
Theseus, being by the forementioned accident advanced to the regal sceptre, soon found the inconvenience of having his people dispersed in
villages, and cantoned up and down the country. Therefore, for the



10 GRÈCIAN ANTIQUITIES.
remedy of this evil, he framed in his mind ( saith Plutarch) a vast and wonderful design , of gathering together all the inhabitants of Attica into
one town, and making them one people of one city, that were before dis persed, and very difficult to be assembled upon any affair, though relating
to the common benefit of them all. Nay, often such differences and
quarrels happened among them, as occasioned bloodshed and war ; these he, by his persuasions, appeased, and going from people to people, and
from tribe to tribe, proposed his design of a common agreement between them . Those of a more private and mean condition readily embracing so good advice ; to those of greater power and interest, he promised a com monwealth, wherein monarchy being laid aside, the power should be in
the people ; and that, reserving to himself only to be continued the com mander of their arms, and the preserver of their laws, there should be an equal distribution of all things else among them ; and by this means he
brought most of them over to his proposal. The rest, fearing his power , which was already grown very formidable, and knowing his courage and
resolution , chose rather to be persuaded, than forced into a compliance . • He then dissolved all the distinct courts of justice, and council-halls,
and corporations, and built one common prytaneum, and council-hall,
where it stands to this day. And out of the old and new city, he made one, which he named Athens, ordaining a common feast and sacrifice to be for ever observed, which he called Panathenæa, or the sacrifice of all
the united Athenians. He instituted also another sacrifice, for the sake of strangers that would come to fix at Athens, called Memoiria, which is
yet celebrated on the sixteenth day of Hecatombæon . Then, as he had
promised, he laid down his kingly power, and settled a commonwealth , having entered upon this great change, not without advice from the gods.
For, sending to consult the Delphian oracle, concerning the fortune of his new government and city, he received this answer :
Αιγείδη θησε , Πιτθηΐδος έκγονα κούρης, Πολλαίς του πολίεσσι Πατήρ έμός εγκατέθηκε,, Τέρματα δε κλωστήρας εν υμετέρω πτολιάθρω"" 'Αλλά συ μήτε λίην πεπονημένος ένδοθι θυμόν Βουλεύειν , ασκός γαρ έν οίδματι ποντοπορεύση.

Which oracle, they say, one of the Sibyls, a long time after, did in a manner repeat to the Athenians in this verse :
'Ασκός βαπτίζη, δύναι δέ τοι ου θέμις εστί. Thou , like a bladder, may'st be wet, but never sink.
Farther, yet designing to enlarge his city, he invited all strangers to come and enjoy equal privileges' with the natives ; and some are of opinion, that the common form of proclamation in Athens, Ašūg' lts, Trávtes acà, Come hither, all ye people, were the words that Theseus caused



CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. 11
to be proclaimed , when he thus set up a commonwealth , consisting, in a manner, of all nations.
• For all this he suffered not his state, by the promiscuous multitude that flowed in , to be turned into confusion and anarchy, and left without any order or degrees, but was the first that divided the commonwealth
into three distinct ranks, Evrurgidos, reágyon, Amulongyol, i. e, noblemen , husbandmen , and artificers. To the nobility he committed the choice of
magistrates, the teaching and dispensing of the laws, and the interpreta tion of all holy and religious things ; the whole city, as to all other mat ters, being as it were reduced to an equality, the nobles excelling the
rest in honour, the husbandmen in profit, and the artificers in number . And Theseus was the first who, as Aristotle says, out of an inclination to popular government, parted with the regal power ; which Homer also
seems to intimate in his catalogue of the ships, where he gives the name of Añuos, or people, to the Athenians only .'
In this manner Theseus settled the Athenian government, and it con tinued in the same state till the death of Codrus, the seventeenth and last king, a prince more renowned for his bravery than fortune. For Attica 1
being invaded by the Dorians, or Spartans, or Peloponnesians, or as some will have it, by the Thracians, the oracle was consulted about it, and answer made, that the invaders should have success if they did not kill
the Athenian king ; whereupon Codrus, preferring his country's safety before his own life, disguised himself in the habit of a peasant, and went to a place not far from the enemy's camp, where picking a quarrel with some of them, he obtained the death which he so much desired. The
Athenians being advertised of what had happened, sent a herald to the enemy to demand the body of their king, who were so much disheartened
by this unexpected accident, that they immediately broke up their camp, and left off their enterprise without striking another blow .
The Athenians, out of reverence to Codrus’ memory , would never more have any governor by the name or title of King, but were governed by Archontes, whom they allowed indeed to continue in their dignity as long as they lived, and when they died, to leave it to their children ; and therefore most writers reckon them rather amongst the kings, than the
archontes that succeeded them , who were permitted to rule only for a certain time ; yet they differed from the kings in this, that they were in a manner subject to the people, being obliged to render an account of their management when it should be demanded . The first of these was Medon , the eldest son of Codrus, from whom the thirteen following archontes
were surnamed Medontidæ, as being descended from him . During their government the Athenian state suffered no considerable alteration , but was carried on with so great ease and quietness, that scarce any mention is made of any memorable action done by any of them, and the very names of some of them are almost quite forgotten .

Thus I have endeavoured to give you a short account of the Athenian
state, whilst it was governed by kings, who were in all thirty, and ruled Athens for the space of seven hundred and ninety -four years, as the
learned Meursius has computed them ; to which, if you add the two-and thirty years of Ogyges, and the interval of a hundred and ninety years, in which no trace of any government is to be found, the number will amount to one thousand and sixteen years.

CHAP. IV.
OF THE STATE OF ATHENS FROM THE DECENNIAL ARCHONS TO PHILIP OF MACEDON .
The people of Athens continually got ground of their superiors, gaining something by every alteration that was made in the state, till at length, by little and little, the whole government came into the hands of the commonalty. Theseus and Medon made considerable abatements in
their power ; but what remained of it, they kept in their own hands as
long as they lived, and preserved the succession entire to their posterity.
But in the first year of the seventh Olympiad, both the power and succes sion devolved upon the people, who, the better to curb the pride and restrain the power of their archons, continued them in their government only for ten years ; and the first that was created in this manner was Charops, the son of Æschylus. But they would not rest contented here; for about seventy years after, that the archons might be wholly dependent
on the citizens' favour, it was agreed that their authority should last but for one year, at the end of which they were to give an account of their administration ; and the first of these was Cleon, who entered upon his
charge in the third year of the twenty -fourth Olympiad." In the thirty-ninth Olympiad, Draco was archon, and was the author of many new laws, chiefly remarkable for their cruelty and inhumanity, punishing almost every trivial offence with death ; insomuch that those

that were convicted of idleness were to die, and those that stole a cabbage or an apple , to suffer as the villains that committed sacrilege or murder; and therefore Demades is remarked for saying that Draco's laws were not
written with ink but blood : and he himself being asked , why he made
death the punishment of most offences ? replied , small crimes deserve that, and I have no higher for the greatest.
But all these , that only excepted which concerned murder, were re pealed in the third year of the forty -sixth Olympiad, in which Solon , being archon , was intri ted with the power of new -modelling the com
monwealth, and making laws for it. They gave him power over all their
magistrates, says Plutarch, their assemblies, courts, and senates ; that he should appoint the number, times of meeting, and what estate they should have that could be capable of being admitted to them , and to dissolve or
continue any of the present constitutions, according to his judgment and discretion .'
Solon finding the people variously affected , some inclined to a monarchy, others to an oligarchy, others to a democracy, the rich men powerful and
haughty, the poor groaning under the burden of their oppression, endea voured, as far as was possible, to compose all their differences, to ease their grievances, and give all reasonable persons satisfaction . In the prosecution of his design , he divided the Athenians into four ranks, according to every man's estate. Those who were worth five hundred
medimns of liquid and dry commodities, he placed in the first rank, calling them Tivtamoolopédrcayai. The next were the horsemen , called
' Itrúda tidoūvtss, being such as were of the ability to furnish out a horse, or were worth three hundred medimns. The third class consisted of those that had two hundred medimus, and were called Zsugiran. In the last,
he placed all the rest, calling them óñtes, and pronounced them incapable
of bearing any office in the government, but suffered them to give their votes in all public assemblies ; which, though at the first it appeared in
considerable , was afterwards found to be a very important privilege ; for, it being permitted any man after the determination of the magistrates to make an appeal to the people assembled in convocation, it happened that causes of the greatest weight and moment were brought before them .
And thus he continued the power and magistracy in the hands of the rich men, and yet neither exposed the inferior people to their cruelty and
oppression , nor wholly deprived them of having a share in the govern ment. Of this equality he himself makes mention :
Δήμω μεν γαρ έδωκα τόσον κράτος όσσον επαρκεί ,, Τιμής ούτ' αφελών ουτ' επορεξάμενος. ο ? δ' είχον , δύναμιν, και χρήμασιν ήσαν άγητοι, Και τους εφρασάμην μηδέν αεικές έχειν * στην δ ' άμφιβαλων κρατερόν σάκος αμφοτέροισι Κετόν δ' ουκ είασ ' άμφοτέρους αδίκως.
What power was fit, I did on all bestow , Nor raised the poor too high, nor sunk too low ; The rich that ruled, and every office bore, Confin'd by laws, could not oppress the poor : Both parties I secur'd from lawless might, That none should e'er prevail against another's right. CREEce.

Not many years after, the city being divided into factions, Pisistratus, by
å stratagem , seized upon the government: for having, on purpose, wounded himself, he was brought into the market -place in a chair, where he ex
posed his wounds to the people, assuring them that he had been so dealt
with by the adverse party for his affection to their government.

thirty
years
,
during

of

He was succeeded by his sons Hipparchus and Hippias, whom Hera clides calls Thessalus ; the former of whom was slain by Aristogeiton, and the latter, about three or four years after, compelled by Clisthenes, who called to his assistance the banished Alcmæonidæ and the Lacedæmoni
ans, to relinquish his government, and secure himself by dishonourable
flight. Being thus banished his country, he fled into Persia, where he lived many years, persuading Darius to the enterprise upon Athens, which at length , to his eternal shame and dishonour, he undertook . For
levying a numerous host of men, he entered the Athenian territories,
where both he and his whole army were totally defeated by an inconsi derable number of men, under the conduct of Miltiades, in the famous
battle of Marathon . This victory was obtained twenty years after Hip pias's expulsion. And thus the Athenians recovered their laws and
liberties, about sixty -eight years after they had been deprived of them by
Pisistratus. After this success, they continued in a flourishing condition for three and -thirty years ; but then the scene changed, and reduced them almost
to the lowest ebb of fortune. Xerxes, in revenge of his predecessor's
defeat, invaded their territories with an army (as some say) of seventeen hundred thousand men, and forced them to quit their city , and leave it a prey to the insulting barbarians, who took it without any considerable
resistance, and laid it in ashes; and in the year following, his lieutenant Mardonius, in imitation of his master's example, burned it a second time.
But these storms were soon blown over, by the wisdom and courage of Themistocles and Aristides, who totally defeated the Persian fleet at Salamis, and seconded that victory by another of no less importance over Mardonius at Platzea, whereby the barbarians were quite driven out of

But the state suffered some alterations ; for, first, Aristides, a person
(as Plutarch assures us) of mean extraction and meaner fortune, being, in consideration of his eminent virtues, and signal services to the common
wealth , preferred to the dignity of an archon , repealed Solon's laws, by which the oñiss, or lowest order of people, were made incapable of bear
ing any office in the government; and after him , Pericles, having lessened the power of the areopagites, brought in a confused ochlocracy , whereby the populace and basest of the rabble obtained as great a share in the
government as persons of the highest birth and quality.
Notwithstanding these alterations at home, all things were carried on with great success abroad . The Athenians, by the help of their fleet, on which they laid out their whole strength , when Xerxes forced them to
quit their city, became sole lords of the sea, and made themselves masters of the greater part of the Ægean islands; and having either forced the
rest of the Greeks into subjection , or awed them into a confederacy, went on conquerors to the borders of Egypt, and had (as Aristophanes reports) a thousand cities under their dominions. But afterwards, things succeeding ill in Sicily under the command of
Nicias, and some other troubles arising in the commonwealth, the princi pal men of Athens, being wearied with the people's insolency, took this
opportunity to change the form of government, and bring the sovereignty into the hands of a few . To which purpose , conspiring with the captains
that were abroad, they caused them to set up an aristocracy in the towns
of their confederates; and in the mean time, some that were most likely
to oppose this innovation, being slain at Athens, the commonalty were so dismayed, that none durst open his mouth against the conspirators, whose number they knew not ; but every man was afraid of his neighbour, lest he should have a hand in the plot. In this general consternation , the
government of Athens was usurped by four hundred, who, preserving in show the ancient form of proceeding, caused all matters to be propounded
to the people, and concluded upon by the greater part of the voices ; but the things propounded were only such as had been first agreed upon
among themselves : neither had the commonalty any other liberty than only that of approving and giving consent; for whosoever presumed to take upon him any farther, was quickly dispatched out of the way, inquiry made after the murderers. By these means many decrees were made, all tending to the establishment of this new authority, which,
nevertheless, endured not long : for the fleet and army, which were then at the isle of Samos, altogether detesting these tyrannical proceedings of
the four hundred us ers, recalled Alcibiades from his banishment ; and
partly out of fear of him, partly because they found the citizens incensed against them, the tyrants voluntarily resigned their authority, and went into banishment.

Yet was not this alteration of government a full restitution of the sovereign command to the people , or whole body of the city, but only to five thousand , whom the four hundred (when their authority began ) had pretended to take to them as assistants in the government; herein seem
ing to do little or no wrong to the commonalty, who seldom assembled in a greater number : and therefore no decrees were passed in the name of the four hundred, but all was said to be done by the five thousand ; and
the usurpers were called ( says Plato ') Taytaxtoxíndo , Tetpaxório de övres , five thousand, though they did not exceed four hundred . But now ,
when
the
power
was
come
indeed
into
the
hands
of
so
many
,
it
was
soon
agreed
that
Alcibiades
and
his
friends
should
be
recalled
from
exile
by
the
citi
zens
,
as
they
had
before
been
by
the
soldiers
;
and
that
the
army
at
Samos
should
be
requested
to
undertake
the
government
,
which
was
forthwith
reformed
according
to
the
soldiers
'
desire
.
This establishment of affairs at home was immediately seconded with
good success from abroad ; for, by the help of Alcibiades, they in a short time obtained several very important victories: but the giddy multitude being soon after incensed against him, he was banished a second time.?
His absence had always before been fatal to the Athenians, but never so much so as at this time ; for their navy at Ægos-Potamos, through the carelessness of the commanders, was betrayed into the hands of Lysander, the Lacedæmonian admiral, who took and sunk almost the whole fleet;
so that, of two or three hundred sail of ships, there escaped not above eight.
After this victory , Lysander joining his own forces with those of Agis and Pausanias, kings of Sparta, marched directly to Athens, which was surrendered to them upon terms, whereby the Athenians obliged them
selves to pull down the long walls, by which the city was joined to the
Piræeus or haven , and deliver up all their naval forces, only ten, or , as
some say , twelve ships excepted . Nay, there was a consultation held, whether the city should be utterly destroyed, and the land about it laid waste ; and Agis had carried it in the affirmative , had not Lysander opposed him, urging, that one of the eyes of Greece ought not to be
plucked out. However , he forced them to alter their form of government, and change their democracy into an oligarchy, a state ever affected by the Lacedæmonians.
In compliance, therefore, with the commands of their conquerors, the people of Athens chose thirty governors, commonly called The thirty tyrants , the names of whom you may see in Xenophon. These were
chosen with a design to compile a body of their laws, and make a collec- ! tion of such ancient statutes as were fittest to be put in practice in that
juncture of affairs, which were called xaivoà yógos, or new laws. And to this charge was annexed the supreme authority ; and the whole govern ment of the city intrusted in their hands. At first they seemed to pro

.
ceed with some show of justice ; and apprehending such troublesome fellows as were odious to the city, but could not be taken hold of by the
laws, condemned them to death . But having afterwards obtained a guard
from the Spartans to secure the city, as was pretended, to their obedience,
they soon discovered what they had been aiming at ; for they sought no
more after base and detested persons, but invaded the leading and princi pal men of the city, sending armed men from house to house, to dispatch
such as were like to make any head against their government. And to
add the greater strength to their party, and colour to their proceedings, they selected three thousand of such citizens as they thought fittest for
their purpose, and gave them some part of the public authority, disarming all the rest. Being confirmed with this accession of strength, they pro
ceeded in their bloody designs with more heat and vigour than before,
putting to death all that were possessed of estates, without any form of justice, or so much as any the least pique or grudge against them , only
that their riches 'might fall into their hands. Nay, so far were they transported with cruelty and covetousness, that they agreed that every one of them should name his man , upon whose goods he should seize, by putting the owner to death ; and when Theramenes, one of their own number, professed his detestation of so horrid a design , they condemned him forthwith , and compelled him to drink poison. This Theramenes
was at the first a mighty stickler for the tyrants' authority ; but when
they began to abuse it, by defending such outrageous practices, no man more violently opposed it than he ; and thus he got the nick -name of
Κόθορνος , Or Jack of both sides , (και γάρ κόθορνος αρμόττειν μεν τοις ποσίν
depeporégois dorsi,) from cothurnus, which was a kind of shoe that fitted both feet.
At length the Athenians, to the number of seventy, that had fled to
Thebes, going voluntarily into banishment to secure themselves from the tyrants, entered into a conspiracy against them, and , under the conduct
of Thrasybulus, seized upon Pylé, a strong castle in the territory of Athens; and increasing their strength and numbers by little and little,
so far prevailed against them , that they were forced to retire to Sparta, and then all their laws were repealed, and the upstart form of government
utterly dissolved. Thus the Athenians regained their liberty, and were
re - established in the peaceable enjoyment of their lands and fortunes, in the fourth year of the 94th Olympiad. And to prevent all future jealou
sies and quarrels amongst themselves, they proclaimed an ' Apernatíu, or act of oblivion , whereby all that had been concerned in the outrages and barbarities committed during the sovereignty of the tyrants, were admitted
to pardon .
Thrasybulus having thus freed his country from the heavy yoke of the
Lacedæmonians, Conon established it in all its ancient privileges and immunities, by another signal victory at Cnidus, wherein he gave a total
defeat to the Lacedæmonian fleet. Having by this means regained the B3

sovereignty of the seas, they began again to take courage, and aimed now
at nothing less than the restoration of Athens to her ancient glory : and
fortune was not wanting in some measure to further their great design ; for they not only reduced the isle of Lesbos, Byzantium , Chalcedon, and other places thereabouts to their former obedience, but raised Athens
once more to be the most potent, and the principal city in all Greece.

state

The death of Epaminondas proved no less fatal to the Athenians than
the Thebans ; for now there being none whose virtues they could emulate,
or whose power they could fear, they lorded it without a rival; and being glutted with too much prosperity, gave themselves over to idleness and luxury. They slighted the virtue of their ancestors ; their hard and
thrifty way of living they laughed at; the public revenues, which used to be employed in paying the fleets and armies, they expended upon games and sports, and lavishly diffused them in sumptuous preparations for festivals; they took greater pleasure in going to the theatre, and hearing the insipid jests of the comedian, than in manly exercises and feats of war ; preferred a mimic, or a stage- player, before the most valiant and
experienced captain : nay, they were so besotted with their pleasures,
that they made it a capital crime for any man to propose the re-establish ing their army, or converting the public revenues to the maintenance of it, as Libanius observes.?
This degenerate disposition of theirs, and the rest of the Greeks, who
were also drowned in the same security, gave opportunity and leisure to Philip, who had been educated under the discipline of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, to raise the Macedonians from a mean and obscure condition
to the empire of all Greece and Asia ; ?-a design projected and begun by
Philip, but achieved and perfected by his son , Alexander the Great.
CHAP. V.
OF THE STATE OF ATHENS FROM PHILIP OF MACEDON TO ITS DELIVERY BY
THE ROMANS.
THE Athenians, and the rest of the Greeks, made some resistance
against the victorious arms of Philip, but were overthrown in a pitched

CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. 19
battle at Chæronea , in the third year of the 110th Olympiad. This
defeat put an end to the Grecian glory, and in a great measure to their liberty , which , for so many ages, and against the most puissant monarchs, they had preserved entire till that time, but were never again able to recover. However, Philip , that he might be declared captain -general of
Greece against the Persians without any further trouble, and strengthen
his army by the accession of their forces, was content to forbear any farther attempt upon the Athenians, and to permit them to enjoy a show of liberty .
No sooner was Philip dead , than they revolted, and endeavoured to free themselves from the Macedonian yoke ; but were easily brought into sub
jection by Alexander, and as easily obtained pardon of him, being then very eager to invade Persia, and unwilling to be diverted, by taking revenge upon those petty states, from a more noble and glorious enterprise.
And during his life they continued quiet, not daring to move so much as
their tongues against him . Only towards the latter end of his reign , when he was busied in the wars with remote countries, and not at leisure
to take notice of every little opposition , they refused to entertain the banished persons, whom Alexander had commanded should be restored in
all the cities of Greece. However, they durst not break out into open
rebellion ; but gave secret orders to Leosthenes, one of their captains, to
levy an army in his own name, and be ready whenever they should have
occasion for him : Leosthenes obeyed their commands, and as soon as certain news was brought that Alexander was dead in Persia , being joined by some others of the Grecian states, they proclaimed open war against the Macedonians, in defence of the liberty of Greece. But being in the
end totally defeated by Antipater, they were forced to entertain a garrison
in Munychia, and submit to what conditions the conqueror pleased to im pose upon them . He therefore changed their form of government, and
instituted an oligarchy, depriving all those that were not worth two thousand drachms of the right of suffrage ; and the bette to keep them
quiet, all mutinous and disaffected persons he transplanted into Thrace. By this means the supreme power came into the hands of about nine thousand ,
About four years after, Antipater died, and the city fell into the hands of Cassander, who succeeded in the kingdom of Macedon . From him they made many attempts to free themselves, and regain their beloved
democracy, but were in the end forced to submit, in the third year of the 115th Olympiad, and accept of a garrison like that which Antipater had imposed upon them , to live under the same form of government, and
obey any person that the conqueror should nominate to the supreme power in it. The man appointed to be their governor was Demetrius the
Phalerean, who, as ' Diogenes Laërtius reports, was of the family of Conon ,
and studied philosophy under Theophrastus. He used them with all

possible kindness and moderation , enlarged their revenues, beautified their city with magnificent structures, and restored it almost to its former lustre ; and they, in requital of these favours, bestowed on him all the honours which in so poor a condition they were able to give, erecting to
him three hundred statues, according to the number of days in the Attic year, most of which were on horseback. But all this was the effect of flattery and dissimulation, rather than any real respect to him ; all his
moderation , all the benefits he had conferred on them , could not beget in
them any sincere affection for him ; they still hated him , though they had no other reason for it than that he was set over them by Cassander ; and
though their power was gone, yet their spirits were still too high to brook any thing that savoured of tyranny. And this in a few years was made manifest ; for when Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son of Antigonus, took up
arms, as was pretended , in defence of the liberty of Greece, they received him with loud acclamations, and all possible expressions of joy ; compelled
the Phalerean to secure himself by flight, in his absence condemned him
to die, and lay in wait to apprehend him, and bring him to execution ; and when they could not compass his person, vented their rage and malice upon his statues, which they pulled down with the greatest detes
tation and abhorrence, breaking some to pieces, selling others, and casting others into the sea ; so that of three hundred there were none left re maining, except only one in the citadel, as the fore-mentioned author has
reported.
Demetrius Poliorcetes having got possession of the city, restored to the Athenians their popular government, bestowed upon them fifteen thousand measures of wheat, and such a quantity of timber as would enable them
to build a hundred galleys for the defence of their city, and left them in full possession of their liberty, without any garrison to keep them in obedience.
So transported were the Athenians with this deliverance, that by a wild and extravagant gratitude, they bestowed upon Demetrius and Antigo
nus, not only the title of kings, though that was a name they had hitherto declined, but called them their tutelar deities and deliverers; they instituted priests to them ; enacted a law , that the ambassadors whom
they should send to them, should have the same style and character with
those who were accustomed to be sent to Delphi, to consult the oracle of the Pythian Apollo, or to Elis to the Olympian Jupiter, to perform the Grecian solemnities, and make oblations for the safety and preservation of
their city, whom they called Oswpoi. They appointed lodgings for Demetrius in the temple of Minerva, and consecrated an altar in the place where he first alighted from his chariot, calling it the altar of
Demetrius the Alighter, and added infinite other instances of the most gross and sordid flattery, of which Plutarch ? and others give us a large account ; for, says a learned modern author, the Athenians having for
gotten how to employ their hands, made up that defect with their tongues,

converting to base flattery that eloquence which the virtues of their ancestors had suited into more manly arguments.
But
afterwards,
when
Demetrius's
fortune
began
to
decline
,
he
was
no
longer
their
god
,
or
their
deliverer
,
but
in
requital
of
all
his
former
kindnesses
,
they
basely
deserted
him
,
denied
him
entrance
into
their
city
,
and
,
by
a
popular
edict
,
made
it
death
for
any
person
so
much
as
to
propose
a
treaty
or
accommodation
with
him
.
Then
the
city
being

broiled
in
civil
dissensions,
one
Lachares
seized
the
government
;
but
upon
the
approach
of
Demetrius
,
was
forced
to
quit
his
new
usurped
authority
,
and
preserve
himself
by
a
timely
flight
.
Thus
they
were
a
second
time
in
possession
of
Demetrius,
who
,
notwithstanding
their
former
shameful
ingratitude,
received
them
again
into
favour
,
bestowed
upon
them
a
hundred
thousand
bushels
of
wheat
,
and
to
ingratiate
himself
the
more
with

,
advanced
such
persons
to
public
offices
as
he
knew
to
be
most
acceptable
to
the
people.
,
This
un
expected
generosity
transported
them
so
far
beyond
themselves,
that
at
the
motion
of
Dromoclides
an
orator
,
it
was
decreed
by
the
unanimous
suffrage
of
the
people
,
that
the
haven
of
Piræeus,
and
the
castle
of
Munychia
,
should
be
put
into
the
hands
of
Demetrius,
to
dispose
of
them
as
he
pleased
.
And
he
having
learned
by
their
former
inconstancy
,
not
to
repose
too
much
trust
in
such
humble
servants
,
put
strong
garrisons
into
those
two
places
,
and
by
his
own
authority
placed
a
third
in
the
Museum
,
to
the
end
,
says
Plutarch
,
that
those
people
who
had
showed
so
much
levity
in
their
dispositions
might
be
kept
in
subjection
,
and
not
by
their
future
perfidies
be
able
to
divert
him
from
the
prosecution
of
other
enterprises. But
all
this
care
was
not
sufficient
to
keep
a
people
,
restless
and
impa
tient
of
any
thing
that
savoured
of
servitude
,
in
obedience
;
for
Deme
trius's
power
being
again
diminished
by
divers
bad
successes,
they
made
another
revolt,
expelled
his
garrison
,
and
proclaimed
liberty
to
all
Athenians
;
and
to
do
him
the
greater
disgrace
,
they
displaced
Diphilus,
who
was
that
year
the
priest
of
two
tutelar
deities,
that
is
,
Antigonus
and
Demetrius,
and
by
an
edict
of
the
people
restored
the
priesthood
to
its
ancient
form
.
Again
,
Demetrius
having
recovered
himself
a
little
,
and
being
justly
enraged
against
them
,
for
their
repeated
perfidies
,
laid
close
siege
to

,
but
by
the
persuasion
of
Craterus,
the
philosopher,
was
wrought
upon
to
quit
it

and
leave

Some

after

was

and prevailed with Diogenes the governor, to deliver up the Piræeus, Munychia, Salamis, and Sunium , to the Athenians, in consideration of a hundred and fifty talents, whereof Aratus himself gave twenty to the city.
Of all these changes and successes we have a large account in Pausanias, Plutarch , and Diodorus.
Not long after this re- establishment, they quarrelled with Philip, king of Macedon , who reduced them to great extremities, laid waste their

of them ; all which losses, with a great many aggravations, are elegantly set forth in an oration of the Athenian ambassadors to the Ætolians, in
Livy .' But the Romans coming to their assistance, Philip was forced to forsake his enterprise, and, being afterwards entirely defeated, left the Greeks in full possession of their liberty, which, at least some show of it, they enjoyed many years, under the Roman protection.
CHAP VI.
OF THE STATE OF ATHENS FROM ITS CONFEDERACY WITH ROME TO
CONSTANTINE THE GREAT.
THE Greeks, and others that put themselves under the Roman protec
tion , though they gilded their condition with the specious name of liberty, yet were no farther free than it pleased those in whose power they were. They were governed indeed by their own laws, and had the privilege of electing their own magistrates ; yet their laws were of small force , if they
seemed any way to oppose the Roman interest and good pleasure ; and in
the election of magistrates, and ordering public affairs, though every man might give his voice which way he pleased, yet if he thwarted the Roman designs, or was cold in his affection to them , or (which was the same)
but warm in the defence of the liberties and privileges of his country, he was looked upon with a jealous eye, as a favourer of rebellion, and an enemy to the Romans.
For no other reason , a thousand of the most eminent Achæans, without any charge, or so much as suspicion of treachery , were sent prisoners to Rome; where, notwithstanding all the testimonies of their innocence, and
the solicitations of their country , which never ceased to importune the senate for their liberty, they endured an imprisonment of seventeen years ; which being expired, to the number of thirty of them were released, amongst whom was Polybius, from whose impartial history we have an account of all these proceedings, which their own historians endeavour to

was
palliate , though they cannot deny them . All the rest either died in
prison , or , upon attempting to make their escape , suffered as malefactors.
By these and such like means, whilst some sought by flattery and com pliance to insinuate themselves into the favour of the Romans, others out of fear and cowardice resolved to swim with the stream , and those few
that had courage and resolution to appear for their country, were little regarded. Every thing was carried on according to the desire of the Romans ; and if any thing happened contrary to it, their agents presently
made an appeal to the senate, which reserved to themselves a power of re ceiving such like complaints, and determining as they thought convenient ; and those that would not submit to this decision were proceeded against as enemies, and forced by power of arms into obedience .

In this state stood the affairs of the Athenians under the Roman
government: and, whether in consideration of the easiness of this yoke,
if compared with that which the Macedonians imposed upon them , or through meanness of spirit, contracted by being long accustomed to
misfortunes, or for want of power to assert their liberty, or for all these reasons, they patiently submitted themselves, seeming satisfied with the enjoyment of this slavish freedom , which in a few ages before they would have rejected with the greatest indignation , and endeavoured to deliver themselves from , though their lives and their fortunes should have been hazarded in the enterprise.
From this time to the war with Mithridates, they continued without any remarkable alterations; but either by the persuasions of Ariston the philosopher, or out of fear of Mithridates's army, they had the bad fortune to take his part, and receive Archestratus, one of his lieutenants, within
their walls ; at which Sylla being enraged, laid siege to the city, took it, and committed so merciless a slaughter, that the very channels in the
streets flowed with blood . At this time the Piræeus and Munychia were burned to the ground, their walls demolished, their ancient monu
ments destroyed , and the whole city so defaced , that it was never able to recover its former beauty till the time of Adrian.'
The storm being blown over, they lived in peace till the time of the

civil war between Cæsar and Pompey , in which they sided with Pompey , and were very closely besieged by Q. Fusius Calenus, Cæsar's lieutenant,
who spoiled and destroyed all the adjacent country, and seized upon the Piræeus, being at that time unfortified, and a place of little strength.
But news being brought that Pompey was totally routed , they yielded themselves into the hands of the conqueror, who, according to his wonted
generosity, received them into favour, and this he did out of respect to the glory and virtue of their ancestors, giving out that he pardoned the living for the sake of the dead.
But it seems they still retained some sparks, at least, of their old love
for popular government; for when Cæsar was dead, they joined them selves to Brutus and Cassius, his murderers ; and besides other honours
done to them, placed their statues next to those of Harmodius and Aris togeiton, two famous patriots, that defended the liberty of their country against the tyranny of Pisistratus's sons. Brutus and Cassius being defeated, they went over to Antony, who behaved himself very obligingly towards them and the rest of the Gre cians, being fond, saith Plutarch ,” of being styled a lover of Greece, but above all in being called a lover of Athens, to which city he made con siderable presents ; and, as others tell us, gave the Athenians the domi nion of the islands of Tenus, Ægina, Icus, Sciathes, and Peparethus.
Augustus having overcome Antony, handled them a little more severely for their ingratitude to his father ; and besides some other privi leges, as that of selling the freedom of the city, took from them the isle of Ægina . Towards the latter end of his reign they began to revolt,
but were easily reduced to their former obedience; and notwithstanding all the cruelties, ravages, and other misfortunes they had suffered , Strabo, who flourished in the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, tells us they enjoyed many
privileges, retained their ancient form of government, and lived in a flourishing condition in his days. And Germanicus, the adopted son of ·Tiberius, making a journey that way , honoured them with the privilege of having a lietor, who was an officer that attended upon the chief magis trates at Rome, and was accounted a mark of sovereign power.
In this condition they remained, with little alteration, till the reign of Vespasian , who reduced Attica and all Achaia to be a Roman province, exacting tribute of them , and compelling them to be governed by the Roman laws.
Under Nerva, some shadow , at least, of liberty was restored to them ; but they were still under the government of a proconsul, and received
most of their laws from the emperor, who also nominated the professors in their public schools, and appointed them archons: and hence it came
to pass, that Adrian, before his advancement to the empire, was invested in that office. In the same state they continued in Trajan's time, as
appears from an epistle of Pliny to Maximus, who was sent to govern

Achaia, wherein he advised him to use his power with moderation, and tells him in particular of the Athenians, that it would be a barbarous
piece of inhumanity to deprive them of that shadow and name of liberty which was all that remained to them .
But notwithstanding the peace and privileges they enjoyed under these
and other emperors of Rome, they were never able to repair those vast losses they had suffered under Sylla, till the reign of Adrian, who, in the
time of his being archon, took a particular affection to this city ; and when
he was promoted to be emperor, granted them very large privileges, gave them just and moderate laws, bestowed on them a large donative of money, and annual provisions of corn , and the whole island ofCephalenia ;
repaired their old decayed castles, restored them to their ancient splen
dour, and added one whole region of new buildings at his own charge, which he called Adrianopolis, and New Athens, as appears as well from
other records, as also from an inscription upon an aqueduct, begun by this emperor, and finished by his successor Antoninus:

AQUÆDUCTUM. IN. NOVIS. ATHENIS. CEPTUM . A. DIVO .
ADRIANO, PATRE. SUO. CONSUMMAVIT. DEDICAVITQUE, 2
The meaning of which is, that Antoninus had finished the aqueduct in
New Athens, that had been begun by his father and predecessor Adrian. And from another of Gruter's inscriptions it appears that they acknow
ledged him to be the second founder of their city : ΑΙ Δ ΕΙΣ ΑΘΗΝΑΙ ΘΗΣΕΩΣ Η ΠΡΙΝ ΠΟΛΙΣ ΑΙ Δ ΕΙΣ ΑΔΡΙΑΝΟΥ Κ ΟΥΧΙ ΘΗΣΕΩΣ ΠΟΛΙΣ.3
The substance of which is, that Athens was formerly the city of Theseus, but New Athens belongs to Adrian . Many other privileges this emperor
granted them , which were continued and enlarged by his successors M. Antoninus Pius, and M. Antoninus the philosopher, the latter of
whom allowed them stipends for the maintenance of public professors in arts and sciences, and was himself initiated amongst them . But Severus having received some affront from them when he was a private person , and studied in Athens, was resolved to pay them home as soon as he was emperor ; and for no other reason , as it is thought, deprived them of a great part of their privileges.*
Valerian was more favourable to them , and permitted them to rebuild their city walls, which had lain in rubbish between 300 and 400 years, from the time that Sylla dismantled them .” But these fortifications could not protect them from the fury of the

they desisted from that purpose for this reason , viz. that the Greeks, by employing their time upon them , might be diverted from martial affairs.
CHAP. VII .
OF THE STATE OF ATHENS FROM CONSTANTINE THE GREAT.
Towards the declination of the Roman greatness, the chief magistrate of Athens was called by the name of Srpernyos, i . e. Duke ; but Constan tine the Great, besides many other privileges granted to the city, honoured
him with the title of Mégas orgatagòs, or Grand Duke.? Constantius, at the request of Proæresius, enlarged their dominions, by a grant of several islands in the Archipelago.
Under Arcadius and Honorius, Alaric, king of the Goths, made an
incursion into Greece, and pillaged and destroyed all before him ; but, as Zosimus reports, was diverted from his design upon Athens by a vision,
wherein the tutelar goddess of that city appeared to him in armour , and in the form of those statues which are dedicated to Minerva the Protec
tress, and Achilles, in the same manner that Homer represents him when, being enraged for the death of Patroclus, he fell with his utmost fury upon the Trojans. But the writers of those times make no mention
of any such thing: on the contrary , they tell us, that Athens sufiered the common fate of the rest of Greece :
-Fera

-Griping chains enslaved the Athenian dames.
And Synesius, who lived in the same age, tells us, there was nothing left in it splendid or remarkable, nothing to be admired, except the famous names of ancient ruins ; and that, as in a sacrifice, when the body
is consumed, there remains nothing of the beast but an empty skin ; so it
was in Athens, where all the stately and magnificent structures were turned into ruinous heaps, and nothing but old decayed outsides left remaining .“

eo rude and barbarous, or because they lived in peace and obscurity, without achieving or suffering anything deserving to be transmitted to
posterity, there is no account of anything that passed between them till the thirteenth century.
At that time, Nicetas tells us, Athens was in the hands of Baldwin, and was besieged by one of the generals of Theodorus Lascares, who was
then the Greek emperor, but he was repulsed with loss, and forced to raise the siege. Not long after, it was besieged by the Marquis Bonila cius, who made himself master of it ." It was afterwards governed by one Delves, of the house of Arragon ;
and after his death fell into the hands of Bajazet, emperor of the Turks. Afterwards it was taken by the Spaniards of Catalonia, under the com mand of Andronicus Palæologus the elder . And these are the same that
Chalcocondylas calls Kearißnges, and reports, they were dispossessed of it by Reinerius Acciaiolo, a Florentine, who, having no legitimate male issue, left it by his last will and testament to the state of Venice. The Venetians were not long masters of it, being dispossessed by
Antony, a natural son of Reinerius, who had given him the sovereignty of Thebes and Bæotia ; and from this time it continued some years under
the government of the Acciaioli : for Antony was succeeded by one of his kinsmen, called Nerius. Nerius was displaced by his brother Antony for
his insufficiency, and unfitness to govern ; and after Antony's death, recovered it again ; but leaving only one son, then an infant, was suc
ceeded by his wife, who, for her folly, was ejected by Mahomet, upon the complaint of Francus, the son of Antony II . , who succeeded her ;
and having confined her some time in prison, put her to death, and was upon that score accused by her son to Mahomet II . , who sent an army under the conduct of Omares to besiege him . Francus, upon this, made
his application to the Latins ; but they refused to grant him any assistance, unless he would engage his subjects in all things to conform to the
Romish superstition , and renounce all those articles, wherein the Greek church differs from them ; which he not being able to do, was forced to surrender it to Turks, in the year of our Lord 1455,4 and in their
hands it continues to this day.5

because such places were a good defence against invaders, but more espe cially because they hoped to be secured by them from inundations, which the people of those times exceedingly dreaded, having heard and experi
enced the sad effects of them under Ogyges and Deucalion . Afterwards, when the number of inhabitants was increased, the whole plain was filled
with buildings, which were called, from their situation, ' H zétw rós,
or the lower city ; and Cecropia was then named 'H ävw rólus, or 'Argó Tohis, the upper city . The circuit of the citadel was three score stadia : it was fenced in with
wooden pales, or, as some say, was set about with olive trees ; and there fore, in Xerxes's invasion , when the oracle advised the Athenians to defend themselves with walls of wood, some were of opinion they were
commanded to enter into the Acropolis, and there receive the enemy ; which some of them did, but after a desperate resistance, were over
powered by numbers, and forced to suffer the sad effects of their fond interpretation 3
It was fortified with a strong wall, one part of which was built by
Cimon, the son of Miltiades, out of the spoils taken in the Persian war,
and was called Kopecriou osíxos, being on the south side of the citadel.* The north wall was built many ages before, by Agrolas, says Pausanias, or, according to Pliny, by Euryalus and Hyperbius, two brothers, who
first taught the Athenians the art of building houses, whereas, till that
time, they lived in caves . They were Tyrrhenians born ; and by that
nation all sorts of building are said to have been first begun in Greece ; and from them walls and castles were called Túpoulses This wall was narmed Πελασγικόν, or Πελαργικών, because the founders of it were called
Pelasgi, from their continual wandering, and removing from one country to another, in the manner of storks, which the Greeks call IIsaagyoss Thucydides tells us there was an execration laid upon any that should
build houses under this wall ; because the Pelasgi, whilst they dwelt there, entered into a conspiracy against the Athenians .' And Pollu

The inside of the citadel was adorned with innumerable edifices, sta
tues, and monuments, wherein all the ancient stories were described at
large, insomuch that Aristides tells us it looked like one continued orna ment . The description of all these would be tedious, and is already
performed by Meursius, who hath, with vast industry, collected into one body all the relics of antiquity which lay dispersed here and there in ancient authors. The most remarkable of them were these :
The temple of Minerva, called Nixn, or Victory, in which the goddess was represented , having a pomegranate in her right hand, and a helmet
in her left, and without wings, in memory of Theseus's good success in Crete, the fame whereof had not reached Athens before his arrival ; but
in other places Victory was usually represented with wings. It was placed at the right hand of the entrance of the citadel, and was built with
white marble.
About the middle of the citadel was the stately temple of Minerva,
called Parthenon ; because that goddess preserved her virginity pure and
inviolate, or because it was dedicated by the daughters of Erechtheus, who were peculiarly called flapbévos, virgins. It was called also 'Exatan Fidov, because it was a hundred feet square. It was burned by the Per sians, but restored again by Pericles, and enlarged fifty feet on each side. Sir George Wheeler reports, that it is two hundred avid seventeen feet
nine inches long, and ninety -eight feet six inches broad ; and consists altogether of admirable white marble, and both for matter and art is the
most beautiful piece of antiquity remaining in the world .?

The temple of Neptune, surnamed Erechtheus, which was a double building, and, besides other curiosities, contained the salt spring called 'Epszonës, which was feigned to have burst out of the earth from a stroke of Neptune's trident in his contention with Minerva. This part was consecrated to Neptune. The other part of the temple belonged to
Minerva, surnamed Iloaices, i. e. protectress of the city ; and [Icvò gooos , from one of Cecrops's daughters of that name. Here was the sacred
olive produeed by Minerva ; and the goddess's image, which was said to have fallen from heaven in Erichthonius's reign. It was kept by one or
two dragons, called oixougoà 70815, and had a lamp always burning with oil, and an owl placed before it. Both of them remain to this day ; and the lesser edifice, which is an entrance to the other, is twenty-nine feet long, and twenty -one feet three inches broad ; the larger is sixty -three feet and a half long, and thirty -six feet broad. The roof is supported by Ionic pillars channeled ; but the chapiters seem to be a mixture between that and the Doric order.2

edifices in the citadel; among others, the chapels of Jupiter wring, and
of 2 Minerva súrupa ; the temple of Agraulos, the daughter of Cecrops, or rather of Minerva, worshipped by that name, in the front and steep
side of the rock ; and the temple of Venus ' ITTONútuia , consecrated by
Phædra when she was in love with Hippolytus." The lower city, containing all the buildings which surrounded the
citadel, with the fort Munychia, and the two havens, Phalerum and Piræeus, was encompassed with walls of unequal strength , being built at
different times, and by different hands . The chief parts of them were the Marga asign, which joined the haven of Piræeus to the city, being
about five miles in length ; and therefore Plutarch calls them Maxgà exian, long legs , and Propertius, brachia longa, long arms. They con sisted of two sides, one of which lay towards the north, and was built by Pericles," with vast expense, containing forty stadia ; the other lay to the

As to the streets in Athens, this much is said of them in general, that they were not very uniform or beautiful : 1 and though Homer calls it

yet that seems only to imply the bigness, and not the beauty of them ; for so that poet has used the same epithet in other places. The number of them , without question , was very great ; but most of their names are

The temple of Vulcan , or of Vulcan and Minerva, not far from Cera
micus within the city, seems to have been a public prison , frequent mention being made of persons tortured there.! Near this place was the temple of the heavenly Venus; for they had
a twofold Venus, one of which was called Oupavia, and the other lávonpos:
the former presided over chaste and pure love ; the latter was the patroness of lust and debauchery. And as their natures and characters were different, so were also the ceremonies used in their worship. They that worshipped the former, behaved themselves with all modesty and gravity ; but the latter was pleased only with lewdness and wantonness . Whence Solon permitted public strumpets to prostitute themselves in her
temple. Besides these, Venus had several other temples, as those which were erected upon the account of Demetrius Poliorcetes, to Venus Lamia
and Leana, in honour of two of his mistresses called by those names .
Nay, so gross flattery did the Athenians degenerate into, that they en rolled several of his parasites in the number of their deities, and honoured
thern with temples and altars.? The temple of Theseus was erected by Cimon , in the middle of the
city, near the place where the youth performed their wrestlings, and
other exercises of body, and was allowed the privilege of being a sanctuary for slaves, and all those of mean condition that fled from the
persecution of men in power, in memory that Theseus while he lived was
an assister and protector of the distressed. A great many other temples were consecrated to him in his lifetime, as grateful acknowledgments of
the benefits he had conferred upon the city ; all which, four only excepted, he dedicated to Hercules, and changed their names from onosia to 'Hpáxassa , after he had been rescued by him from the king of the Molos sians, as Plutarch reports out of Philochorus . One of these was put to various other uses ; for certain magistrates were created in it by the thesmothetæ . Causes also were heard there, and it was a public prison ,
and therefore a gaol-bird is wittily called nouiórgit, in Aristophanes : such a one Plautus, with no less elegancy , names Colonus carceris . The temple of Theseus is still to be seen , and is built, as Sir George Wheeler reports, in all respects like the temple of Minerva in the
citadel, as to its matter, form , and order of architecture, but not so large It is dedicated to St George, and still remains a masterpiece of architec ture, not easy to be paralleled , much less exceeded by any other.

[lásdsov, was a temple dedicated to all the gods, who, as they were
united in one temple, so were they honoured with one common festival, called oužívia . This was a very magnificent structure, and supported by a
hundred and twenty marble pillars: on the outside were all the histories
of the gods, curiously engraven ; and upon the great gate stood two horses, excellently carved by Praxiteles. The temple of the Eight Winds, omitted by Pausanias, but mentioned and described by Sir George Wheeler out of Vitruvius, who reports , that such as had made exact observations about the winds, divided them into
eight ; namely, Andronicus Cyrrhastes, who gave this model to the Athenians ; for he built a tower of eight square, of marble, on every side of which he carved the figure of a wind, according to the quarter it blew
from. On the top of the tower he erected a little pyramid of marble, on
the point of which was placed a brazen triton, holding a switch in his right hand, wherewith turning about, he pointed to the wind that then blew .
All the winds answered exactly to the compass, and were represented by figures answerable to their natures, above which were written their names in large Greek letters, which are these that follow : ETPOZ, Eurus, south - east. AIIHAINTHY, Subsolanus, east. KAIKIAX, Cæcias, north
east. BOPEAX, Boreas, north . EKIPON , Corus, north -west. ZE$TPOY, Occidens, west. NOTOX, Notus, south . ATY, Libs, Africus, south - west.
This tower remains yet entire, the weathercock only excepted. 1 Eroai, or porticoes, they had a great many, but the most remarkable was that which was called Πεισιανάκτιος , and afterwards Ποικίλη, from the
variety it contained of curious pictures, drawn by the greatest masters in Greece; such were Polygnotus, Mycon , and Pandænus, the brother of Phidias. Here it was that Zeno taught philosophy, and instituted that
sect which received their names from this place, being called Erwiran,
from Arch. And the portico itself is usually put for that sect of philoso
phers, as when Athenaeus calls Zeno της Στοάς κτιστήν, the founder of the Stoics.

also he was buried . This fort was forced by Antigonus to entertain a garrison ; and his son Demetrius, to make it more secure , surrounded it with a wall.' 'nosior, was a music-theatre, built by Pericles ; the inside was full of
seats and ranges of pillars ; and on the outside, the roof or covering was made from one point at the top with a great many bendings, all shelving downward . It is reported , says Plutarch , that it was so framed in imita
tion of the king of Persia's pavilion . Here was also a tribunal, as we
learn from Aristophanes . It was very much beautified by Lycurgus, but, being demolished in the Mithridatic war, was re -built by Herodes Atticus, with such splendour and magnificence, that, as Pausanias tells us, it surpassed all the famous buildings in Greece. It stood in the
Cerameicus, of which name there were two places, so called from Ceramus
the son of Bacchus and Ariadne ; " or από της κεραμεικής τέχνης, from the potter's art, which was first invented in one of these places by Chorcebus. One of them was within the city, and contained innumerable
buildings, as temples, theatres, porticoes, &c. The other was in the suburbs, and was a public burying-place, and contained the Academy, and many other edifices.
The Athenian 'Ayogai, or fora , were very numerous; but the most noted of them were two, the old forum and the new. The new forum
was in a place called 'Epsrgia, by Strabo ; which it is probable was not far from Zeno's Portico, because Pausanias tells us that in his time the forum was near that place. The old forum was in the Cerameicus within
the city called ' Agmaic &yogá. In it were held the public assemblies of
the people : but the chief design of it was for the meeting of people to buy and sell, and therefore it was divided into different parts, according to the
wares exposed to sale ; for every trade had a different place assigned to make their markets in : and hence we read of Kúx205, where slaves and
vassals were sold ; 'Αλφιτόπολις άγορά, Ιχθυοπωλις αγορά, and Γυναικεία

eyoga , where women's clothes and ornaments were exposed ; and others without number. Sometimes they called the fora by the single names of things sold in them , as Olvos, the wine-market, 'Elaboy, the oil-market,
&c. The time in which things were exposed to sale, was called mádovou
égopà, full market, from the multitudes of people that assembled at such times ; and there seems to have been different hours appointed for particular wares, which I suppose is the reason that Suidas, in some places, tells us, the full market was at the third hour, in others, that it was at the fourth , fifth , and sixth.
Besides these places, the tradesmen had their Boyasuthgua, or public halls, wlterein each company met, and consulted about their atlairs. For
trades were very much encouraged at Athens; and if any man reproached another with living by such gain , the person affronted might have an action of slander against him . “ Nay, trades were so far from being
aecounted a mean and ignoble way of living, that persons of the greatest quality did not disdain to betake themselves to such employments, and especially to merchandise, as Plutarch informs us. Solon, ' says he ,
• applied himself to merchandise, though some there are that report, that he travelled rather to get learning and experience, than to raise an estate. In the time of Hesiod, a trade was not dishonourable, nor did it debase
its followers ; but merchandise was a worthy calling, which brought home the good things that barbarous nations enjoyed , was the occasion of friend
ship with their kings, and mother of experience . Some merchants have
built great cities, as the founder of Masilia, that man so much esteemed
by the Gauls, that lived about the Rhine; some also report, that Thales, and Hippocrates the mathematician , traded ; and that Plato defrayed the charges of his travels by selling oil in Egypt.'* Aqueducts were not common at Athens before the Roman times ; and
the want of them was supplied by wells, some of which were dug by
private persons, others at the public expense ; but the country, having but few potable rivers (for Eridanus, Strabo 5 tells us, was muddy, and not fit

for use ), lakes or large springs, was but poorly furnished with water, which gave occasion to continual quarrels amongst the citizens. Solon
enacted a law , that where there was a public well within a hippocon , that is, four furlongs, all should have the privilege of drawing at that ; but those that lived at a greater distance should be obliged to provide a private well ; and if they had dug ten fathom deep, and could find no water, they had liberty to fetch ten gallons a day from their neighbour's ; for he thought it prudent, says my author, to make provision against want, but not to encourage idleness. Adrian, besides other magnificent structures, laid the foundations of a stately aqueduct, which was finished by his suc cessor Antoninus : and one part of it still remains, sustained by Ionic
pillars: which Sir George Wheeler is of opinion was the frontispiece of the repository or receiver of the water.
Gymnasia are said to have been first in use at Lacedæmon , but were afterwards very common in all the parts of Greece, and imitated, very much augmented, and improved at Rome. They were not single edifices,
but a knot of buildings united, being so capacious as to hold many thousand people at once , and having room enough for philosophers, rhetoricians, and the professors of all other sciences, to read their lectures ; and wrestlers, dancers , and all others that would , to exercise at the same
time, without the least disturbance or interruption . They consisted of a great many parts, the chief of which were these :
1. Srovi, the porticoes, which were full of itedgal, and side-buildings
furnished with seats, and fit for study or discourse ; and here it is probable the scholars used to meet.
2. 'Epúbavov, the place where the ephebi, or youths, exercised ; or, as some say , where those that designed to exercise met, and agreed what kind of exercise they should contend in, and what should be the victor's reward .
3. Kopixsion, émodurúgion, yopevaothgrov, the undressing-room . 4. ' Erarodioios, ádurthgrow, the place where those that were to wrestle, or had bathed, were anointed .
5. Kovorágios, rovíotga , the place where the dust, with which they be sprinkled those that had been anointed , was kept. 6. Hahaíotpa, which, sometimes taken for the whole gymnasium , in its proper acceptation signifies the place wherein all the exercises of the
Trévredhoy, or , as others say, only wrestling, and the Ilaryxgátio were per formed ; and lest the combatants should slip, or hurt themselves by falling, the bottom of it was covered with dust or gravel. Also there was another
room in the gymnasium , filled with gravel, much deeper than that in the palestra.
7. Spaspirtágios, a place appointed for various sorts of exercises, but more especially for the ball.
8. The spaces between the porticoes and the wall, left void to admit

the light, and the area of the ligsotúdiov, or piazza, which was a large
place, square, or sometimes oblong, in the middle of the gymnasium , de signed for walking, and the performance of those exercises which were not practised in the palæstra, or the deeper sand, or any other place in the
gymnasium , such were, as some are of opinion , leaping, and the discus.

9. zúrto , and Eboru, which were distinct places both in Greece and Rome. Xysti were places covered at the top , designed for the exercise
of wrestlers, when the weather did not permit them to contend in the open air. Xysta, sometimes called Tepadgopédss, were walks open at the
top, designed for exercises or recreation in the heat of summer , and milder seasons of the winter .
10. The baths, in which were waters hot and cold in different degrees ;
and in these they refreshed themselves, when they were wearied with exercise, and at other times. Amongst the ancient Greeks baths were not much frequented , being rarely used but after the accomplishment of some very great work which required abundance of labour and toil, as the
ending of a war , or achieving any great and painful enterprise. Thus Agamemnon, after the Trojan war , at his return home, went into the
bath, there to wash away the remembrance of all his past labours, and was slain by the treachery of his wife Clytemnestra. In later ages they be came more common , and were frequently used for health or recreation by both sexes , who at Sparta washed in one common bath, but in other cities had distinct places appointed them . 11. The stadium was a large semicircle, in which exercises were per
formed ; and for the better convenience of spectators, who flocked thither in vast multitudes, was built with steps one above another, that the higher ranks might look over the heads of those that were placed below them . Several of these there were at Athens, in their gymnasia and other places ; but the most remarkable was that which was built near the river Ilissus
by Lycurgus, and afterwards enlarged by Herodes Atticus, one of the richest citizens Athens ever had : it was built of Pentelic marble, with so great magnificence , that when Pausanias comes to speak of it, he tells his
readers, that they would hardly believe what he was about to tell them, it being a wonder to all that beheld it, and of such stupendous bigness, that one would judge it a mountain of white marble upon the banks of Ilissus. Sir George Wheeler reports, that there still remains some of the
work, at the end towards the river, but the rest is only a stadium of earth above ground. However, its figure and bigness continue, though
the degrees be all taken away . It is a long place, with two parallel sides, closed up circularly to the east end, and open towards the other end ; and
is about one hundred and twenty - five geometrical paces long, and twenty six or twenty -seven broad, which gave it the name of a stadium , which
was a measure ordinarily used among the Greeks, being the eighth part, of a Roman mile.3

Athens had several gymnasia, of which these three are of most note ; Lyceum , Academia, and Cynosarges.
Auxsion, Lyceum , was situated upon the banks of Ilissus. It received its name from Apollo Auxoxtóvos, or Aúxros, to whom it was dedicated ;
nor was it without reason , says Plutarch , that this place was sacred to
Apollo, but upon a good and rational account, since from the same deity. that cures our diseases, and restores our health, we may reasonably expect strength and ability to contend in the exercises. The building of this structure is by some ascribed to Pisistratus, by others to Pericles, and, by others to Lycurgus; which makes it probable that all of them might contribute something towards it : perhaps Pisistratus laid the foundations of it, Pericles raised it, and Lycurgus enlarged and beautified it. This was the place where Aristotle taught philosophy, and discoursed with such as resorted to him for instruction , walking constantly every day
till the hour of anointing ; for the Greeks usually anointed before meals ; whence he and his followers were called Περιπατητικοί, από του περιπατείν,
Peripatetics, from walking. Though others report, that his walking and discoursing philosophy with Alexander was the occasion of that name. ’ Axadhusce, was part of the Cerameicus without the city, from which it was distant about six stadia, so called from Academus, an old hero, who,
when Helena was stolen by Theseus, and concealed at Aphidnæ , discovered
her to Castor and Pollux, for which reason he was extremely honoured by them during his life ; and the Lacedæmonians, when in after ages they
made several incursions into Attica, and destroyed all the country round about, always spared this place for his sake. But Dicæarchus writes, that
there were two Arcadians in the army of Castor and Pollux, the one. called Echedemus, and the other Marathus; from the former, that which
was afterwards called the Academy, was then called Echedemia, and the borough of Marathon had its name from the latter . It was beset with
shady woods and solitary walks, fit for study and meditation , as the poets, and others witness. This verse is cited out of Eupolis:", 'Εν συσκίους δρόμοισιν 'Ακαδήμου θεού . In Academus' shady walks.

they being drained by Cimon, it became pleasant and delightful, and was much frequented by all sorts of people, especially such as applied themselves to the study of philosophy, for they resorted thither in great numbers to
Plato's lectures, who read constantly in this place; whence having con tracted a distemper through the unwholesomeness of the air, which was
not yet wholly rectified , and being advised by his physicians to remove
his sehool to the Lyceum, made answer, that he chose the Academy to keep his body under, lest by too much health it should become wanton ,
and more difficult to be governed by the dictates of reason ; as men prune vines, when they spread too far, and lop off the branches that grow too luxuriant. I must not forget to add, that it was surrounded with a wall
by Hipparchus the son of Pisistratus, who, to defray the charges of it, laid
so heavy a tax upon the people, that ever after any chargeable and expen
sive business was called “Ιππάρκου τείχιον. Kuródugyes was a place in the suburbs near the Lyceum , so called from
a white or swift dog, in Greek xúm egyės, that, when Diomus was sacri ficing to Hercules, snatched away part of the victim. It was adorned
with several temples, dedicated to Hebe, Alcmena, and Iolaus, all which
bore some relation to Hercules, the chief deity of the place ; and he also was here honoured with a magnificent temple. But there was nothing in it so remarkable as the gymnasium , in which strangers, and those that were but of the half blood, or had but one parent an Athenian, were to
perform their exercises, because Hercules, to whom it was consecrated , was under some illegitimacy, and was not one of the immortal gods, but had a mortal woman for his mother. And therefore Themistocles being but of the half blood, persuaded several of the young noblemen to accom
pany him to anoint and exercise themselves at Cynosarges ; in doing which, he seemed with some ingenuity to take away the distinction between the truly noble and the stranger; and between those of the
whole, and those of the half blood of Athens. There was also a court of judicature in this place, wherein causes about illegitimacy were heard , and examination made concerning persons that lay under a suspicion of
having falsely inserted their names among the true -born Athenians. In this gymnasium Antisthenes instituted a seet of philosophers called Kuvirai, Cynics, from the name of the place, as some are of opinion .
All Theatres were dedicated to Bacchus and Venus, the deities of sports and pleasure ; to the former of which they are said to owe their original ,' and therefore plays acted in them were called alovurizxd, and the artifcers that laboured in the building of them Διονυσιακοί τεχηται,

ings had well nigh proved fatal to the commonwealth, for almost the
whole city, as well the magistracy and nobility as those of inferior rank, being assembled , as their manner was, to hear Pratinas act a tragedy, the
theatre, too weak to support the vast weight of thronging multitudes , on a sudden tumbled down, and nearly buried them in its ruins . This narrow escape made them more cautious, and was the occasion of erecting a theatre of stone, for their better security. And from this time the Athenians, whose example the rest of the Greeks followed not long after, erected fixed and durable theatres of stone, commonly of marble,
which by degrees were increased to such magnitude that they exceeded almost all other buildings in Greece.

Athens
had
three
harbours
for
ships
:
1. IIcipateùs, Piræcus, which belonged to the tribe of Hippothoontis, and was thirty- five or forty stadia distant from the city, before the building of the long walls, which have been already mentioned . From
which time the Athenians, by the direction of Themistocles, made this
their chief harbour. It contained three oquor, or docks ; the first called Kárlagos, from a hero of that name. The second ’ Appodiosos, from ' AQga
dirn, or Venus, who had there two temples, one of which was consecrated by Themistocles, the other by Conon . The third Zic, from bread -corn,
which is called by the Grecians 316. There were likewise in this
harbour five porticoes, which being joined together, composed one very large portico, which was on that account commonly termed Mazgà otok. The Piræeus had farther two forums; one near the long portico, and the
sea : the other farther distant from the sea ; and for that reason chiefly
frequented by those that lived nearest the city. One of these seems to have been called ' ItTodáussov, from the architect Hippodamus, who built the long wall, whereby this harbour was joined to the city.

OF THE CITIZENS, TRIBES, &c. OF ATHENS.
The inhabitants of Attica were of three sorts : 1. Ilorītus, or freemen .
2. Métoixos, or sojourners. 3. Aoûãou, or servants. The citizens surpassed the others in dignity and power, as having the government in their hands,
but were far exceeded by the slaves in number, many slaves being often subject to one citizen. The number of citizens in Cecrops' time, I have
already said, was twenty thousand ; in Pericles' there were not so many, as appears from Plutarch ;1 and when Demetrius the Phalerean was their
governor, they exceeded their first number under Cecrops only by one thousand ; at the same time the foreigners were ten thousand , and the
slaves four hundred thousand, as appears from a poll instituted at the command of Demetrius, and mentioned in Athenæus.?

ment, for the encouragement of foreigners to settle there, he was forced to allow them the same privileges that were enjoyed by the natives. There
is a very ancient law mentioned by the scholiast of Aristophanes, whereby all foreigners, who intended to live at Athens, were obliged ,
after a short stay in that city, to be enrolled among the free citizens, For several ages after, it was no difficult matter to obtain the freedom of the city : but when the Athenian power grew great, and their glorious actions rendered them famous through all Greece, this privilege was
accounted a very great favour, and granted to none but men of the
greatest birth or reputation, or such as had performed some notable piece of service for the commonwealth . Nor was it without much difficulty to
be obtained even by them . Menon the Pharsalian, who had sent the Athenians a supply of two hundred horse, in the war against Eon near
Amphipolis, desired it, and was rejected ; and Perdiccas, king of Mace
donia , after having assisted them against the Persians, could obtain no more than a bare åriàsic, or immunity from tribute paid by those that sojourned amongst them , but no right of suffrage, or other privileges common to the free men . And after Mardonius and the Persians were

defeated at Platæa, it was decreed, by an express law, that none but men
eminent for merit should be admitted into the number of citizens.
But this peremptory stiffness, which success and victory had put into
them , did not always make them so obstinate, but that many worthies, though neither equal in birth nor fortune to the former, were enrolled
amongst the citizens; such were Hippocrates the physician , Eurysaces the son of Ajax, with many others, besides the whole city of the Platæans, to which they granted freedom for their signal services in the Persian
war . By these grants, though the number of the citizens may be said to
have been increased, yet nothing was added to the number of inhabitants, , which remained still the same, because the persons thus admitted seldom made use of their privilege, and sued for it rather as a title of honour,
than with a design to be anywise benefited by it. This privilege could only be conferred by the popular assembly, whence the citizens thus admitted were called Anuorontoi, in opposition to the free born . Neither was the first gift of the people to take effect, unless they thought fit to ratify it in a second assembly, wherein six thousand
citizens were required to be present. Lest the authority or interest of
any person should sway them to comply with such request against their inclinations, they gave their votes privately, by casting little stones into
urns, placed on purpose in their assemblies by the prytanes, who were also obliged to provide a sufficient number of stones for the suffragants ; nay farther, till all had done voting, the strangers that petitioned for freedom
were not permitted to come into the place of the assembly. After all this , if any one appeared to be undeserving of the honour they had con ferred upon him , an appeal might be made to a certain court, which had power to inquire into the lives and conditions of these persons, and de
prive such as they found unworthy, by recalling the freedom which had
been granted through the ignorance and inconsideration of the multitude ; this disgrace befell Pytholaus the Thessalian , and Apollonides the Olyn
thian .? It was farther provided by Solon, that none should live at Athens
as free citizens, except such as were banished from their own country, or voluntarily came to reside at Athens with their whole families ; whereby
he, no doubt, intended to prevent all those from enjoying the privileges of
Athens, who had greater alliances and interests in other places.

themselves excluded from those offices which were appropriated to the
sacred families. Excepting also the offices of the nine archons, which none but free -born Athenians were allowed to execute ; that neither the
religion nor the management of public aflairs might be intrusted in foreign hands. Yet this extended not to the children of citizens thus
adopted , who were allowed all the privileges of natives. Lastly, they were admitted into a certain tribe and hundred , and so the ceremony ended .
Free -born Athenians were those that had both or one of their parents an Athenian. Aristotle tells us, that in several commonwealths, at the
first, those were accounted free who were born of a free woman ; but that, when the number of inhabitants increased, such only were esteemed free as were descended from parents that were both free. And so it came to pass in Athens, where it was decreed by Solon , that none begotten out of lawful marriage, which could then be celebrated only between free citi
zens, should have right to inherit their father's estate. This appears from the following words of Aristophanes :
' Ερώ δε δή και τον Σολωνός σοι νόμον Νόθω δε μή είναι αγχιστείαν.33
But this law was afterwards abrogated by the tacit consent of the com monwealth , till the time of Pericles, who, when he flourished in the state,
and had sons lawfully begotten, proposed a law , that those only should be reputed true citizens of Athens, who were born of parents that were both
Athenians ; and having prevailed with the people to give their consent to it, little less than five thousand were deprived of their freedom , and sold
for slaves ; and those who, enduring the test, remained in the government, and passed muster for true -born Athenians, were found in the poll to be fourteen thousand and forty persons in number. But Pericles himself
afterwards, having lost all his legitimate sons, so far persuaded the
Athenians, that they cancelled the law, and permitted him to enrol his
bastard sons in the register of his own ward, by his paternal name,
thinking that, by those losses, he had been sufficiently punished for his former arrogance ; and therefore, being of opinion that he had been
shrewdly handled by the divine vengeance, of which he had run so severe å gantelope, and that his request was such as became a man to ask, and
men to grant.* This law was again repealed by Aristophon the orator, after the expulsion of the thirty tyrants, Euclides being archen ; at which time the ancient law was revived , that all whose mothers were not citizens should be vidos, illegitimate . For legitimate children are those who are
born of lawful wives, who must be free citizens, others being only reputed concubines. And thus grammarians commonly explain nothus. Nódos, o

harlot. But yvioios, a legitimate son , is interpreted by the same persons,
ο εκ γυναικός αστής και γαμεσής ή εκ νομίμων γάμων" One born of a citizen and a wife, or one born in laufal matrimony .' Those that were only of the half blood, when they were invested with freedom , were always reputed inferior, and less honourable than those that
were of the whole. They had several marks and customs to distinguish them from the others, as particularly , that those who had but one parent
an Athenian, were not allowed to exercise themselves in any of the gymnasia that were frequented by those who had both, but only at the Cynosarges, a place without the city : and that this was esteemed a mark
of disgrace is evident from the practice of Themistocles, who was but of
the half blood of Athens; and who, to take away , or at least lessen this distinction, used to engage the noble Athenians to go and perform their
exercises with him . In the same place there was a court of judicature, where persons suspected of having fraudulently insinuated themselves into the number and privileges of citizens were arraigned. This was reputed
a very great offence; insomuch that whosoever had the din oñs gevices,
(so this action was termed ) preferred against him , was immediately made a close prisoner, and put in chains, before he could be brought before the
judges. Neither was it a sufficient vindication to have been once
acquitted by his proper judges ; but it was customary to bring the cause to a second hearing before the thesmothetæ , if there was any just cause to suspect that he had been too favourably treated .
In order to clear the city of pretended and false members, it was
deereed , in the second year of the 90th Olympiad, Archias being then archon , that a strict inquisition should be made into causes of this
nature by men of the same borough with the criminal. This inquisition termed dayńquois, was performed in the following method.' When
any person was accused , the Ahuacx0s , or prefeet of the borough (dñpos ), to whose custody was committed the ληξιαρχικών γραμματειον, or public
register of the citizens, convened the members of his borough (onkóraı). Next the names of all the citizens of that borough being recited out of the
register, the criminal was obliged to signify the particular øgargia, or ward, whereof he pretended to be a member, and to prove his right of succession by sufficient witnesses; or , if he claimed his freedom from the
gift of the people, and not by inheritance, the public decree of the popular
assembly , whereby his privilege had been conferred, was to be produced. Then the onuótus, having first taken an oath to determine according to the rules of justice, and after maturely deliberating upon the evidence,
privately gave their opinions ; in doing which, they commonly used leaves or beans. If the white beans were found superior in number, the prisoner was acquitted ; but if the blac appeared to ost numerous, the he
was deprived of his freedom , and after that called apoy npopivos , as the

action of condemning him was termed ároficiais. And this verdict was to be given in before sunset ; the consequence whereof was this ,—that
the person deprived of his freedom should be reckoned amongst the MiToxo, or sojourners. But if he would not acquiesce in the determina
tion of his own borough, an appeal was granted to the thesmothetæ , who having assigned proper judges to hear his appeal, he was either restored
to his family, or , if the former sentence appeared to be just and well grounded, he was sold for a slave.
Farther, to prevent all frauds and contentions of this nature , all fathers
were obliged to enrol their sons in the register of their particular o gatgíu .
termed xouvòv yeaperez Tsioy. At which time they made oath that every son so registered was either born to them in lawful matrimony or lawfully adopted . Notwithstanding which, the opáropes, or members of that ward,
had the liberty of rejecting any person against whom sufficient evidence appeared , concerning which they voted by private suffrages. Yet if any person was unjustly rejected by the men of his own ward, he was allowed
to appeal to the magistrates, 4 by whom , if he was declared to be lawfully born or adopted, he was then registered by his own and his father's name,
in this form , ogáovados ’ Aroadodágou, Thrasyllus the son of Apollodorus." The adopted sons were registered upon the festival Thargelia, in the month Thargelion ; the naturalupon the third day of the festival Apaturia,
called Koupsūris, in the month Pyanepsion. At what age children were thus registered is not agreed. Some are of opinion, that at every return of the Apaturia it was customary to register all the children who had been
born that year. Others affirm , that they were commonly three or four years old before they were registered .? Cnemon in Heliodorus 8 is en

the Ranæ of Aristophanes' reflects upon Archedemus as not having been
admitted into the number of the opérages till he was éttirns, seven years old :

was when they arrived at the age of eighteen years, when, as we are expressly told by Julius Pollux, they were admitted into the number of
the " EpnBou. This registering seems to have been mistaken for the former, because both were done on the same day, viz. the third day of the festival
Apaturia, which , as some think, was called Koupsūtis, &TÒ Toũ zuigsy ring róuny, because they who were enrolled amongst the ephebi used then to
shave their hair, which it was customary to consecrate to some of the gods ; a ceremony which was never performed till a long time after the
age at which they were admitted amongst the Opéroges, and therefore must belong to the other time of registering. The third time of registering young Athenians was before the festival
of Panathenæa ,2 when those who were twenty years old were introduced at a public meeting of the empáran, men of the same (Sāpeos) borough, and entered in a register , called ληξιαρχικών γραμματείον, wherein the names of all persons ofthat borough, who were of age to succeed in the anges, or
inheritance of their fathers, were entered .' This was termed sis äròges
égygépeslas, to be registered amongst the men ; the persons thus enrolled
being henceforwards their own masters, and free from the government of their guardians.
After Cecrops had settled a form of government amongst the Athenians,
for the better administration of justice, and the prevention of deceit, and overreaching one another in commerce, he divided them into four Qurai, or tribes ; each tribe he subdivided into three parts, called Teittùs, "Edvos, and burgía ; and each of these into thirty równ, or families, which, because they consisted of thirty men, were called Tpiezédos ; and they that were members of these, were called ' Ouezúdanta and revñtas, not from any
relation to one another, but only because they lived in the same borough , and were educated together, and joined in one body or society. The
same persons were called ' Ogysūves, because they participated of the same
sacrifices, and worshipped the same gods together ; from "Ogyıc , which , though it properly signifies only the mysteries of Bacchus, yet is often taken for the ceremonies used in the worship of any other deity ."
The names of the tribes were these : 1. Kexponis, from Cecrops ; for it is usual with the ancients, out of an earnest desire of continuing their memories to posterity, to call cities, or countries, or any monuments that
seemed likely to remain to succeeding ages , by their own names . 2. Aúróxbwe, from a king of that name, reported by some to have reigned
in some part of Attica before Cecrops : or rather from the name of Aúrázcloves, indigenous, in which the Athenians gloried not a little . 3. 'Axtaía , from Actæus, or Actæon, another of the kings before Cecrops ; or
from ketà , a shore ; because a great part of Attica, and that in par tieular which this tribe inhabited, lay towards the sea ; and this was the reason why the whole country was sometimes called Acté. And the

same cause is given for the name of the fourth tribe, which they called Ilaganía, from its nearness to the sea . In the reign of Cranaus, new names were imposed upon them , and they were called, 1. Kpavais, from the king's name. 2. ' Ardis, from a young lady, the daughter of Cranaus, 3. Msobyas. 4. Avaxgis. The last
two, I suppose , were named from their situation ; the latter being seated
upon a craggy shore, and the former in the inland part of the country . Ericthonius being advanced to the kingdom , called them after the names of Jupiter, Minerva, Neptune, and Vulcan : 1. Asks. 2. ' Abnais. 3. Ποσειδωνιάς. 4. Ηφαιστιάς.

Afterwards, when the number of inhabitants was increased, Clisthenes
having first consulted the oracle of Apollo, as it was usual to do in every concern of moment, increased the number of the tribes from four to ten, and gave them new names, taken from certain ancient heroes, all born in
Attica, except Ajax the son of Telamon, to whom he gave a place amongst the rest, as being a neighbour, friend, and companion in the wars ;6 for, as Homer reports, Ajax's forces 'were joined to those of Menestheus the Athenian general:
Κίος δ' εκ Σαλαμίνος άγεν ονοκαίδεκα νήας, Twelve ships from Salamis stout Ajax brought, Στήσε δ' άγων εν Αθηναίων ίσταντο φάλαγγες. And rank'd his men where the Athenians fought.

the senate - house . Their names, as recorded by Pausanias, are these : Erechtheus, Cecrops, Ægeus, Pandion, Acamas, Antiochus, Leo, (Eneus, Hippothoon , Ajax. And the names of the tribes are these :
' Egszents, Kixgotis, Aignis, Tlændeovis, 'Axapartis, ' Auriogis, Asorris , Oimis, ' Iztodowytis, Aluvtis.
Afterwards, when Antigonus and Demetrius freed the Athenians
from the Macedonian slavery , they augmented their tribes, adding two to their former number, which in honour of their deliverers, they called
from their names 'Αντιγονίς εnd Δημητριάς. But the gratitude of the Athenians being no longer - lived than the good fortune and successes of those two princes, the tribes soon changed their first names for those of
'Ατταλίς and Πτολεμαΐς, the former of which was derived from Attalus , king of Pergamus; the latter from Ptolemy, king of Egypt, from both of whom the Athenians had received signal favours.2 This was the constant number of the Athenian tribes, which lasted as
long as the city maintained its liberty and form of government. Each of these was at the first divided into several parts, which have been already mentioned. And the better to maintain a mutual correspondence, and
for the promotion of good fellowship and kindness among them, they had public feasts, first instituted by Solon, where they all met together, and made merry . These meetings were named from the persons assembled at them ; if the whole tribe came together, then they called it drītvon
φυλετικών ; if only one φρατρία , then it was δείπνον Φρατρικών και or if a δήμος , it was δείπνον δημοτικόν..
These dayon were little boroughs in Attica, several of which belonged to every tribe ; and though they were reckoned together in the business of
the commonwealth, yet had separate habitations, distinct rites and cere
monies in the performance of holy worship : nay, and different gods too ,
for each of them adored peculiar deities, and yet all unanimously agreed in worshipping Minerva, who was the tutelar goddess of the whole
country ; whereas the other deities had only certain parts assigned them , and in those they were inferior to Minerva, the supreme governess. This difference in religion was very ancient, being of no less duration than
the commonwealth itself; for when Theseus had prevailed upon them to leave their country -seats, and unite themselves in one city, they thought it would be impious aud unpardonable to desert the gods of their ances tors, and therefore judged it agreeable to the respect due from them to their tutelar deities, to pay them the same honours, and frequent the same
places of worship they had formerly done.4 The greatest use of these dños, was in their forms of law , and contracts, ·
whereby sufficient provision was made against all fraud, deceit, and mis takes. Hence we read of such punctual clauses in their writs as these, N. the son of N. of the tribe of Æantis, in the borough of Rhamnus, & c.

time
,
whereas
the
MiTorxou
had
fixed
habitations,
and
constantly
resided
upon
the
place
whither
they
had
transplanted
themselves.
They were permitted to dwell in the city and follow their own business without disturbance, but could not be intrusted with any public office , give their votes in the assemblies, or have any share in the government ;
being obliged to sit still, as spectators in a theatre, without intermeddling ,
or any way concerning themselves with state affairs, and patiently submit to the decrees enacted by the citizens, and observe all the laws and cus toms of the country.
And
therefore
Aristophanes
in
Suidas
compares
them
to
chaff
,
as
being
an
unprofitable
and
useless
part
of
the
com

:

..
The
snjourners
(

I
may

mind
)
Are, as it were, the city's chaff and scum.-J. A.
They were not allowed to act any thing or manage any business in their
own names, but were obliged to choose out of the citizens one, to whose care and protection they would commit themselves, and whose duty it was to defend them from all violence and oppression . This is intimated
in Terence's Eunuchus,' where Thais puts herself into the hands of Phædria's family. T person to whom they committed themselves was
called sportátní, and was allowed to demand several services of them, in
which if they failed , or if they neglected to choose a patron , an action was commenced against them before the Polemarchus, called ' ATOOTH
olov dirn, whereupon their goods were confiscated .
In consideration of the privileges allowed them , the commonwealth required them to perform several duties ; for instance , in the Panathenæa, a festival celebrated in honour of Minerva, the men were obliged to carry
certain vessels called orépon, whereby are meant not spades, as Meursius
and the translator of Harpocration have explained this word, but naviculæ , little ships, which were signs of their foreign extraction , which few have hitherto rightly understood. Hence the were termed σκαφείς or σκαφη
pogor by the ancient writers of comedy. The women carried üdías, vessels of water, or oxiádsia, umbrellas, to defend the free women from
the weather, and are thence named udgsapógoi and oradnpógor. This last custom was begun after Xerxes and the Persians had been driven out of
Greece, when the. Athenians, becoming insolent, with success, set a
greater value upon the freedom of their city than they had formerly done.? Besides this, the men paid an annual tribute of twelve drachms, though Hesychius mentions ten only ; and the women that had no sons were liable to be taxed six, but such as had sons that paid, were excused. This tribute was called petoix.ov, and was exacted not only of those that
dwelt in Athens, but of all such as settled themselves in any town of
Attica, as appears from the instance given us by Lysias , in Oropus,
which was an Athenian town , situated upon the confines of Bæotia . 1

CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. 63
About the time of Xerxes' invasion upon Greece, Themistocles having
by his eminent service raised himself to great power in the common
wealth, prevailed so far upon the Athenians, that they remitted this exaction , and continued the sojourners in the enjoyment of their privi
leges, without requiring any such acknowledgment from them . How long they enjoyed this immunity I cannot tell, but it is certain they kept it not long, and probably it might be taken from them, and the act repealed, as soon as Themistocles fell into disgrace. Upon non - payment
of this imposition , the delinquent was immediately seized by the tax masters, and carried away to the market set apart for that purpose ( called by Plutarch Μετοίκιον ,2 and by Demosthenes 8 Πωλητήριον του μετοικίου), where they were exposed to sale by the Ilwantai, who were officers concerned in the public revenues . This fate had the famous philosopher
Xenocrates undergone, had not Lycurgus rescued him out of the hands of the officers, as Plutarch reports ;4 Diogenes Laërtius “ tells us, he was actually sold , because he had not wherewithal to pay the tribute, but was redeemed by Demetrius the Phalerean, who, because he would not violate the laws of the city, nor yet could endure to see so great and useful a man reduced to so miserable a condition, restored him his liberty , and
paid for him what the tax -master demanded.
But though these men were incapable of having any preferment, or
bearing any office in the commonwealth, yet they were not wholly desti tute of encouragement to the practice of virtue, and the undertaking of
noble actions, and being serviceable to the public. For such as signalized
themselves by any notable exploit, were seldom passed by neglected or unrewarded ; but were taken into public consideration , and, by a special
edict of the people, honoured with an immunity from all impositions, taxes, and other duties, except such as were required of the free -born
citizens; and therefore they called this honour loorbasid , and the persons that enjoyed it ισοτελείς , because they did ισα τελεϊν τους αστούς , pay only an equal proportion with the citizens. This was a sort of a half freedom ,
being the same with what we sometimes find called area sice, of which I
have spoken already, and was granted to foreigners that had deserved well of the public, but not merited enough to be enrolled amongst the true
citizens; an instance of which we have in Perdiccas king of Macedon , and sometimes in whole cities and commonwealths, that had by some
special service demonstrated the kindness and good affection they bore to Athens: two examples of this we have in the Thebans and Olynthians, in Theophrastus, as he is cited by Suidas, to whom , with Harpocration and Hesychius, we are chiefly obliged for these accounts. I proceed, in the next place, to speak of the third, and most numerous part of the inhabitants of Attica, I mean the servants, of which there
were two sorts ; the first was of those who through poverty were forced to

64 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
serve for wages, being otherwise freeborn citizens, but not having any suffrage in public affairs, by reason of their indigence, it being forbidden
at some times ( for this prohibition was not perpetual), that persons not having such an estate as was mentioned in the law , should have the privi lege of giving their voices. These were properly called entss, and
IIchémas,' and were the most genteel sort of servants, being only in that state during their own pleasure and necessities, and having power either to change their masters, or, if they became able to subsist by themselves, wholly to release themselves from servitude . The second sort of servants were such as were wholly in the power
and at the disposal of their lords, who had as good a title to them as to their lands and estates, a considerable part of which they were esteemed , They were wholly at their command , to be employed as they saw conve
nient, in the worst and most wretched drudgeries ; and to be used at their
discretion, pinched , starved, beaten, tormented , and that, in most places, without any appeal to superior power, and punished even with death
itself. What yet farther enhanced the misery of their condition , they
had no hopes of recovering their freedom themselves, or procuring it for their posterity, but were to continue in the same condition as long as
they lived ; and all the inheritance they could leave their children (for their masters not only allowed , but encouraged them to marry, that they might increase in number ), was the possession of their parents' miseries,
and a condition scarce any way better than that of beasts. The ancients were very sensible of the hard usage slaves met with ; and
the earnest desire of liberty that reigned in their own breasts, and made them always forward to expose their lives in the defence of it, was a suffi
cient cause to beget in them a jealousy of the like in other persons ; men being generally very apt to suspect others of the same passions and inclinations which themselves have been guilty of. We find them ,
accordingly, eager to prevent and suppress all such motions, by keeping
the slaves at a very great distance from them , by no means condescending (I speak of the generality of them ) to converse familiarly with them ; by instilling into them a mean opinion of themselves ; debasing their natures ,
and extinguishing in them , as much as possible, all sparks of generosity and manhood ; by an illiberal education, and accustoming them to blows
and stripes, which they thought were very disagreeable to ingenuous natures; and subduing them with hard labour and want ; and in short, by
using them almost in the same manner , nay, sometimes worse than we
do brute animals. A sufficient proof whereof (were there no more) we have in the famous Roman , Cato, a man celebrated in all ages, for his
exact observance of the nicest rules of justice ; nor doth it at all invalidate the evidence, that this was done by a Roman , since both at Rome and in Greece, and most other civilized countries, the usage of slaves seems to
have been much the same, some few alterations excepted. This Cato
!
1 Pollux, iii. 8 .



CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. 65
J.A.
(Plutarch tells us ), when his servants grew old and unfit for labour, not
withstanding they had been very faithful and serviceable to him, and had spent their youth and strength in labouring for him, would not be at the
charge of maintaining them , but either turned them away, unable to provide for themselves, or let them starve to death in his own family ." It is true, this barbarity was not practised in all places : and my author thinks the censor blameworthy for it, imputing it to a savage and
unnatural temper ; yet hence appears the miserable condition of slaves, who were forced to undergo the most arbitrary and unjust impositions of the most cruel and barbarous tyrants. Now, the better to show you
in what state they were, I will give a few specimens of the constant behaviour of their masters towards them in instances which were not the effects of the passion , pride, or humour of private persons, but the common
and general practice of the whole country. It was accounted an insufferable piece of impudence for a servant to imitate the freemen in any thing, or affect to be like them in their dress,
or any part of their behaviour. In those cities where they let their hair grow long, for a servant to have long hair was an unpardonable offence, insomuch that the comedian , speaking it proverbially of one that does what becomes him not, says,
' Επειτα δητα δούλος άν κόμην έχεις. To wear long hair like freemen . Then you disdaining your own state, affect
They had a peculiar form after which they cut their hair, called oci
årdparodódns, which they laid aside, if ever fortune was so propitious as to restore them their liberty . And because slaves were generally rude and
ignorant , therefore έχειν τας άνδραποδώδεις επί της ψυχής τρίχας , was proverbially applied to any dull stupid fellow . 3 The freemen's coats
were alleprecoxados, had two sleeves ; whereas those of slaves were frigováoxados, had only one sleeve.4
At Athens it was common to be in love with boys. Socrates' and Plato's amours are notorious enough , and Solon himself was too weak to resist this passion , and thought it neither unlawful nor scandalous, but, on
the contrary , honourable and well becoming an ingenuous education ; therefore he forbade slaves the use of this pleasure, as it were inviting
the worthy to practise, when he commanded the unworthy to forbear ,' says Plutarch. The same lawgiver forbade them to anoint or perfume themselves with sweet odours, allowing those pieces of gentility only to
persons of better birth and quality. Slaves were neither permitted to plead for themselves, nor to be witnesses in any cause. This Terence,
the scene of whose action is laid in Athens, expressly affirms in his Phormio : 6 Sereum hominem causam orare leges non sinunt, A slave the laws will not allow to plead, Neque testimonü dictio est.
Yet it was customary to extort confessions from them by tortures ; which ,
Nor can he be an evidence.

because they were often so violent as to occasion the death of the slave, or
to disable him from being serviceable to his master ; whoever demanded
any slave for this end ( which was called προκαλείν , and the action πρόκλη 015 ) was obliged to give his master a sufficient security to answer the loss of his slave . The several ways of torturing slaves are briefly comprised
in the following verses of Aristophanes. Σ. Βασάνιζε γάρ τον παίδα του - ονι λαβών Binding to a ladder, hang the scoundrel, Α. Και πώς βασανίσω; Ξ . Πάντα τροπον, εν κλίμακι Lash him with a whip of hog's bristles, Δήσας, κρεμάσας, υστριχίδι μαστιγών, δέρων, Skin and rack him , pouring down his nostrils Στρεβλών , επίτι τάς βίνας 8ξος εγχέων, The lees of wine - with blistering of hot bricks,
Ιλίνθους επιτιθείς, πάντα τάλλα, πλήν πράσω And all other sorts of pain ; but mind'ye,
Μη τυπτο τούτον μήτε γηθείω νέω. Never strike him with a rod of onions X. Seize that slave and put him to the torture. Nor let him feel the smarting of young le. ks. A. And how will I torture ? X. Just as you please, J. MCD.
Slaves were not permitted to communicate at the worship of some of the deities, but were accounted unholy and profane, and thought to be offensive to the gods, and to pollute the worship by their presence : as, for
instance, at the worship of the Eumenides, or Furies, at Athens ; and
Hercules at Rome ; of which I shall have occasion to speak something more hereafter.
Their education was quite different from that of freeborn children ;
these were instructed in all the liberal arts, the others only taught how to obey, and drudge in their master's business. And whereas the common method was to win those of ingenuous birth by gentle means into a per
formance of their duty, the manner of tutoring slaves was the same which they used to tame wild beasts, namely, stripes, and the most cruel severity. For all this, there wanted not some, whom nature had blessed with a more
happy genius and a larger share of parts than the rest, and fortune directed to kind and gentle masters, that by their great improvements in learning and wisdom , were a sufficient evidence, that nobility of soul and greatness
of understanding are not confined to any rank or quality, but that even the meanest and most abject persons may dive into the most hidden secrets of nature, and be admitted to the most intimate converse with the
Muses. To prove this we need only mention Æsop, the author of the Fables, Alcmano the poet, and Epictetus the famous moralist, of whose poverty and servile condition we have mention in this epigram :

Though doom'd to bondage, and in indigence. They thought it a presumption , and a sort of lessening the freeborn
citizens, to call slaves by any name that was in use amongst them : but if any man was so bold as to give his servant the name of a person of quality or honour, it was a signal affront. Domitian is said to have punished
Metius Pomposianus for calling his slaves by the illustrious names of
Hannibal and Mago; and to come nearer to our purpose , the Athenians enacted a law , that no man should presume to call any of his servants by the names of Harmodius and Aristogeiton , two famous patriots, that with Courage and resolution opposed the tyranny of Pisistratus's sons. At the

same time there was a law , whereby they were prohibited to derive the name of their slaves from any of the solemn games : whence this question
is propounded by Athenæus:? How came it to pass that Nemea the minstrel derived her name from the Nemean games ? For the most part,
as Strabo reports, they were called after the names of their native countries,
as Audds, or úgos, if they were born in Lydia or Syria; or by the names which were most used in those nations, as Manes, or Midas, in Phrygia ;
l'ibias in Paphlagonia. The most common names in Athens were Geta and Davus, being taken from the Getes and Daci, who, as my author
thinks, were formerly called Axios, or Davi.' They seldom consisted of above two syllables ; and therefore Demosthenes having objected to Æschines, that his father was a slave, tells him farther, as a proof of what he affirmed , that he had falsified his name, calling him Atrometus,
whereas in truth it was only Tromes.3 The reason of this seems to have
been , that their names being short, might be more easily and quickly
pronounced . Upon the same account, Oppian advises to give dogs short names ; Ονόματα σκυλάκισσι

Above all things, especial care was taken that slaves should not wear arms, which, since their number was almost twenty times as great as that of the citizens, might have been dangerous to the public. For this reason
it was not usual for them to serve in the wars ; and therefore when Virgil speaks of a slave's assisting in the wars of Troy, he tells us it was contrary to law and custom .“ Yet sometimes we find the slaves armed in the defence of their masters
and themselves ; but this was never allowed, except in cases of most
extreme danger, when all other means of preserving the commonwealth were taken away . The first time it was practised is said to have been
when the Persians under Darius invaded the Athenians, and received a total overthrow by them in Marathon . The like was afterwards put in
practice by other commonwealths, but not without great caution : Cleo
menes, king of Sparta , being sore pressed by the Macedonians and
Achæans, and finding himself unable to make head against them , armed two thousand of the Helotæ, or Lacedæmonian slaves, that he might make a fit body to oppose Antigonus's Leucaspidæ , or white shields; but

ventured not to list any more of them , though Laconia was at that time furnished with much greater numbers. ? Their prudence in this case
deserves commendation ; for having exasperated them so much by their
hard usage , they had no reason to expect any mercy from them , if ever they should get the upper hand. And it is very wonderful that four
hundred thousand men should groan under the oppression of twenty or
thirty thousand ( for those I have told you already were the number of the slaves, citizens, and sojourners in Attica ), without ever, some few times
excepted, attempting to assert their liberty : when it is evident they wanted not strength to turn the state upside down ; neither could they be. destitute of opportunities, especially in times of war, sedition , and tumults, in which the city was continually embroiled, to accomplish such a design .
But this must be ascribed partly to the watchful eye their masters and the
whole state had upon them ; and partly to that cowardice and degeneracy which usually debase the minds of those whom fortune has placed in a servile condition , however noble and daring they are by nature ; for it is a true saying of Homer :
“Ημισυ γάρ τ' αρετής αποκίνυται εύρυόπα Ζεύς True valour ne'er can animate that mind, 'Ανορος , εύτ ' άν μιν κατά βούλιον ήμαρ έλησιν , Whose inbred seeds by slav'ry are confin'd . - J . A. But neither the care of the state, nor the great power which oppression
has to debase men's souls, could always keep them in subjection ; for nature would sometimes exert itself, when either a fair opportunity invited,
or some insufferable oppression compelled them to endeavour the recovery of their liberties, that is, their lives and fortunes, into their own hands.
Athenæus reports, that in Attica they once seized upon the castle of Sunium, and committed ravages throughout the country ; and at the same
time made their second insurrection in Sicily ; for in that country they frequently rebelled , but were at last reduced with great slaughter, no less than a million of them being killed . ” Several other efforts we find made
by them in other places, to the great danger and almost utter subversion of those countries. Sometimes, in time of war , the slaves deserted to the enemy, the doing which they called autopoksīv, which , excepting theft,
a crime almost peculiar to them , was the most common offence they committed, being in most places the only way they had to deliver them
selves ; but, if they were taken, they were made to pay dearly for their
desire of freedom , being bound fast to a wheel, and unmercifully beaten with whips, as the comedian tells us : “Η δούλος αυτομολεϊν παρεσκευασμένος, Should but anticipate sweet freedom's joys, ' Επί τροχού χ’ έλκουτο μαστιγούμενος.

They who were convicted of any notorious offence were condemned to
grind at the mill, a labour exceedingly toilsome in those days, when they were forced to beat their grain into meal, being unacquainted with the easy way of grinding which is used amongst us, and was the invention of
later ages. And therefore, when they had a mind to express the greatness of any labour or toil, it was usual to compare it to grinding in a mill: Tibi mecum erit, Crasse, in codem pistrino vivendun , says Tully ; a that is, You and I , Crassus, must undergo the same troublesome course of life.
But, besides the labour they were put to, they were beaten with rods, or scourges ; sometimes, if their offence was very great, to death , as we learn from Terence, the scene of whose drama is laid in Attica:
Verberibus cæsum te in pistrinun, Dave, dedam I'll have you beat to mummy, and then thrown usque ad necem . " Into prison, sirrah ! and for life.
Or else, as others understand this place, they were condemned to that punishment as long as they lived.
These mills were called in general púrwyss ; which word, because of
the cruelty there exercised upon poor slaves, Pollux tells us was o'z söönuos, unlucky, or inauspicious, and not to be named , and therefore he calls it
GITOT blizós oixos. They had several names, from the different sorts of
grain that was ground in them, as χονδροκόπια , οι χονδροκοπεία , άλφιτεία , ζώτεια , ζώντεια , or ζωντεία , and ζητρεία, whence comes the word ζατρεύειν , to examine upon the rack, as was usual in that place.*
It was likewise customary to stigmatize slaves, which was usually done in the forehead, as being most visible ; sometimes other parts were thus used , it being customary , as Galen observes, 5 to punish the member that
had offended ; if the slave was a glutton , his belly must suffer ; if a tell tale, his tongue must be cut out, and so of the rest. The common way of stigmatizing was, by burning the member with a red -hot iron , marked with certain letters, till a fair impression was made, and then pouring ink
into the furrows, that the inscription might be the more conspicuous.

Persons thus used were called Eriyuuria and Eriywves, says Pollux, or Attaga , because that bird was moixidón Tigos, of different colours, as Aris
tophanes tells us." Pliny calls them inscripti ; * and others literati, as Plautus : Si hic literatusme sinat.
And what the same author means by trium literarum homo, no man can
be ignorant. This punishment was seldom or never inflicted upon any but slaves; and with them it was so frequent, that the Samians, when they gave a great number of slaves their liberty, and admitted them to offices in the state , were branded with the infamous name of literati: Σαμίων ο δήμος εστί πολυγράμματος , The Samian people ( fie for shame) For store of letters have great fame. - LITTLETON.
saith Aristophanes in Plutarch ; though others, and amongst them
Plutarch himself, assign different reasons for this appellation . This was the greatest mark of ́infamy that could be inflicted on them ; and therefore
Phocylides advises to forbear it, even in slaves : Στίγματα μη γράψης, επονειδίζων θεράποντα και Your slaves brand not with characters of infamy.
On the contrary, in Thrace, Herodotus tells us, it was accounted a badge of honour, and used by none but persons of credit, nor omitted but by
those of the meanest rank . Το μέν έστίχθαι ευγενές κέκριται, το δε άστικτου å revés' to be stigmatized, says he, is reputed a mark of quality, to want which is a disgrace. The same is affirmed by Claudian of the Geloni, who inhabited a part of Scythia :' Membraque qui ferro gaudet pinxisse Gelonus.
Some relate that the ancient Britons tenellis infantibus notas certasque
figuras animalium ardenti ferro imprimebant, that is, imprinted upon the bodies of their infants the figures of animals, and other marks with hot
irons. The same is affirmed by Tertullian , who reports that the Britons
were distinguished by such marks or stigmata, in the same manner as the Garamantes by their feathers, the barbarians by their curls, and the
Athenians by their grasshoppers. Claudian mentions the same custom :10 Ferroque notatas Perlegit exsangues Picto moriente Águras.
But it must not be forgotten in this place, that slaves were not only branded with stigmata for a punishment of their offences, but (which was
the common end of these marks), to distinguish them in case they should desert their masters; for which purpose it was common to brand their soldiers : only with this difference , that whereas slaves were commonly stigmatized in their forehead, and with the name or some peculiar character belonging to their masters, soldiers were branded in the hand, and with the name or character of their general. . After the same manner, it was
likewise customary to stigmatize the worshippers and votaries of some of the gods: whence Lucian , speaking of the votaries of the Syrian goddess,

affirms, They were all branded with certain marks, some in the palms of their hands, and others in their necks : whence it became customary for all
the Assyrians thus to stigmatize themselves. Theodoret is of opinion ,' that the Jews were forbidden to brand themselves with stigmata because
the idolaters, by that ceremony, used to consecrate themselves to their false deities. The marks used on these occasions were various. Somo
times they contained the name of the god, sometimes his particular
ensign ( Fagkonuwv); such were the thunderbolt of Jupiter, the trident of
Neptune, the ivy of Bacchus: whence Ptolemy Philopator was by some nicknamed Gallus, διά το φύλλα κισσού κατίστίχθαι, because his body μας
marked with the figures of ivy -leaves. Or, lastly, they marked them selves with some mystical number whereby the god's name was described . Thus the sun , who was signified by the number 608, is said to have been represented by these two numeral letters xh . These three ways of
stigmatizing are all expressed by St John, in the book of Revelation ; and he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.' But, to return from this digression :
Slaves were treated with more humanity at Athens than in most other
places ; for if any of them were grievously oppressed they were allowed to fly for sanctuary to Theseus's temple, whence to force them was an act
of sacrilege. “ Those that had been barbarously treated by their masters, had the privilege of commencing a suit at law against them , which they
called 'ißetws díxn, or aixias dixn, the former of which was against such as had made any violent attempts upon the chastity of their slaves, the latter
against those that had used too much severity in punishing them ; and if it appeared that the complaint was reasonable and just, the master was obliged to sell his slave . This is plainly proved by Julius Pollux, * out of
Aristophanes's Horæ , when he cites the following verses: Ει μη κράτιστόν έστιν εις το Θησείον Δραμείν, εκεί δ' έως αν εύρωμεν πάσιν,
Μένειν.

The laws at Athens don't our slaves restrain
slaves at Athens had a great deal the advantage of their brethren in other places, in many respects: they might use their tongues'with far greater
freedom , as appears everywhere from the comedies of Aristophanes, Plautus, and Terence, and indulge themselves in the enjoyment of a great many pleasures, which in other places they had not the smallest taste of ;
insomuch that Demosthenes tells us, the condition of a slave in Athens was preferable to that of a free denizen in some other cities ;' and Plautus sufficiently testisies the truth of what he saith : Atque id ne vos miremini, homines servulos Potare, amare, atque ad cænam condicere; From pleasure, mirth, and gaiety of life, Licet hoe Alhenis For they may revel, be inflamed with love, And live at ease as some free denizens. - 7. A.
Farther, they were permitted to get estates for themselves, paying only a small tribute to their masters every year out of them ; and if they could procure as much as would pay for their ransom , their masters had no
power to hinder them from buying their liberty, as may be observed from the same author, who introduces a slave speaking in this manner : Quid tu me vero libertate territas ?

Sometimes, if they had been faithful and diligent in their masters' business, the latter dismissed them of their own accord ; and upon the performance of any remarkable service for the public, the state usually took care to reward them with liberty. Such of them as were admitted to serve in
the wars, were seldom left in the condition of slaves, either for fear the remembrance of their former oppression might move them to revolt to the
enemy, or raise a sedition at home, so fair an opportunity being put into their hands ; or to animate them with greater courage and constancy to
oppose the invaders, when they were to receive so great a reward for the dangers they underwent ; or because it was thought unreasonable that such as hazarded their lives in defence of their country's liberty , should
themselves groan under the heavy yoke of slavery, and be deprived of even the smallest part of that, which was in a great measure owing to their courage and loyalty : for one, I say , or all these reasons, such as upon emergent occasions took up arms for the public safety, seldom failed
of having their liberty restored to them . An instance whereof, we have in the slaves that behaved themselves valiantly in the sea -fight at Arginusæ , where the Athenians obtained a signal victory against Callicratidas, the Lacedæmonian admiral. Thus the slave in Aristophanes being almost
ready to faint under a heavy burden , accuseth his own cowardice, that
hindered him from listing himself amongst the marine forces, and thereby recovering his liberty : Οίμαι κακοδαίμων τί γάρ εγώ ούκ έναυμάχουν.4* Pox take this heart, that durst not meet In boist'rous seas the Spartan fleet.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS .
Slaves, as long as they were under the government of a master, were called oixirai; but after their freedom was granted them , they were doīdas. not being , like the former, a part of their master's estate, but only obliged
to some grateful acknowledgments, and small services, such as were required of the Miroirot, to whom they were in some few things inferior.
They , however, seldom arrived to the dignity of citizens, especially if they had received their freedom from a private person , and not upon a public
account ; for such as were advanced for public services, seem to have lived
in great repute, and enjoyed a larger share of liberty than others that had only merited their freedom by the obligations they had laid upon particular
persons. These therefore were sometimes advanced to be citizens, yet not without the opposition or dislike of many :
Και γαρ αισχρόν έστι, τους μεν ναυμαχήσαντας μίαν , Και Πλαταιάς ευθύς είναι , κάντι δούλων δεσπότας .
It being dishonourable to rank those, who had been in one engagement at
sea , with the Platæans (that is, to honour them with the privileges of Athenian citizens), and from slaves to make them masters, as one affirms in Aristophanes. Whence there was a law enacted, whereby the public
criers were forbidden to proclaim the freedom of a slave in the theatre, that being a place of public concourse, and frequented by men of other cities, who would, on that account, have less value for the privileges of Athens. Lastly, the árstúlegos, slaves made free, were termed vóbos, or bastards ; νόθοι γαρ ούτοι προς τους εκ γενετής ελευθέρους, they being under a sort of illegitimacy, if compared with the genuine and free-born citizens. A tribute of twelve drachms was exacted of the Méto1x01, and the same,
with the addition of three oboli, was required of the freedmen . They
were also obliged to choose a sportátns, who was to be no other than the master out of whose service they had been released . Upon him they attended almost in the same manner with the Roman liberti and clientes ;
but in case they behaved themselves stubbornly and ungratefully towards him , he had power to arrest them and carry them before a judge, by
whom , if they were found guilty , they were deprived of their liberty, and reduced to their former miserable condition . But if the judge acquitted
them , they became osłów éasúlegos, entirely free from the master. This action was termied åportaciou dixn, which name was also given to the complaints made by servants and freedmen against their masters and
patrons, which both of them were allowed to prefer, if they were not treated with all the humanity that was due to their respective conditions : but because all the freedmen's public business, like that of the MiToxos,
was to be managed chiefly by proxies, at their restoration to liberty, both of them had the privilege of choosing an initporos, or curator , who, in
case his client received any injury from his patron , was to defend him,

appeal for him , and plead his cause before the judges, who, from respect to the patron , were appointed out of his own tribe.! This was the condition of slaves in Athens, which, though in itself deplorable enough, yet, if compared with that of their fellow -sufferers in
other cities, seems very easy , at least tolerable , and not to be repined at. I might here give an account of the various conditions of slaves in the several countries of Greece, such as the Penesta in Thessaly ; the Clarotæ
and Mnoitæ in Crete ; the Corynephori in Sicyon ; the Gymnitæ at Argos, and many others; but I shall only at present advert to the state of the Helotæ in Sparta, which, because of the frequent mention made of them in authors, must not be omitted ; and from their treatment, though they
were a more genteel sort of slaves, and enjoyed more privileges than the rest, will appear the truth of what Plutarch tells us, was commonly said of
Sparta, Εν Λακεδαίμονι τον ελεύθερον μάλιστα ελεύθερος είναι, και τον δούλου Húnora doūdor, that in Sparta, he that was free was most so ;, and he that uus a slave was the greatest slave in the world . The Helota were so called from Helos, a Laconian town , conquered
by the Spartans, who made all the inhabitants prisoners of war, and re duced them into the condition of slaves."
The freemen of Sparta were forbidden the exercise of any mean or mecha nical employment; and therefore the whole care of supplying the city with necessaries was devolved upon the Helots; the ground was tilled, and all sorts of trades managed by them ; whilst their masters, gentlemen - like,
spent all their time in dancing and feasting, in their exercises, hunting matches, and the aéoxus, or places where good company used to meet ,5 To be condemned to such drudgeries all their lives might have been at least supportable, had they not been also treated in the most barbarous manner, and often murdered, without committing any fault, and with
out any show of justice, Of this the zgurtid, or secret law, the in vention whereof some ascribe to the Ephori, others to Lycurgus, is a sufficient proof. It was an ordinance ( these are Plutarch's own words), by which those who had the care of the young men, dispatched privately
some of the ablest of them into the country from time to time, armed only
with daggers, and taking a little necessary provision with them : these in the daytime hid themselves in the thickets and clefts, and there lay close ;
but in the night issued out into the highways, and murdered all the Helots they could light upon ; sometimes they set upon them by day, as they were at work in the field, and killed them in cold blood , as

Thucydides reports in his history of the Peloponnesian war. author tells us (with Plutarch ), that a good number of them, being crowned by proclamation (which was a token of their being set free ), en franchised for their good services, and led about to all the temples in token of honour, disappeared all of a sudden, being about the number of two thousand ; and no man either then , or since , could give any account how they came by their deaths. Aristotle adds, that the Ephori, so soon as
they were entered into their office, used to declare war against them, that
they might be massacred with a pretence of law.l • It is confessed on all hands (proceeds my author ), that the Spartans dealt with them very hardly ; for it was a thing common to force them to drink to excess, and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, that their children might see what a contemptible and beastly sight a drunken
man is. They made them to dance uncomely dances, and to sing ridi

76 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
Having taken a survey of the usage slaves generally met with amongst
the ancients, it remains that I state how they fell into this deplorable cull dition, from that liberty which all men are by nature made masters of.
And it seems to have happened these three ways: First, from poverty, whereby men, being unable to subsist of themselves, and perhaps deeply
in debt, were forced to part with their freedom , and yield themselves slaves to such as were able to maintain them ; or sell their bodies to their
creditors, and pay them in service what they were not able to do in money. Secondly, vasť numbers were reduced to slavery by the chance of war, by which the conquered became wholly at the disposal of their con querors. Thirdly, by the perfidiousness of those that traded in slaves,
who often stole persons of ingenuous birth and education, and sold them .
The Thessalians, according to Aristophanes, were notorious for this sort of villany. But if any person was convicted of having betrayed a freeman ,
he was severely punished by Solon's laws, unless it were his daughter, or
sisters, whom the laws permitted them to sell for slaves, when convicted of fornication .
At Athens, several places in the forum were appointed for the sale of slaves, of which I have spoken already ; and upon the first day of every
month the merchants called 'Avdparodonéandas brought them into the mar. ket, and exposed them to sale, the crier standing upon a stone erected
for that purpose , called apathe aidos, and calling the people together ;' whence Cicero opprobriously calls the tribunes emptos de lapide, because they were suspected to have been hired for the management of a certain aflair. 4
At Athens, when a slave was first brought home, there was an enter tainment provided to welcome him to his new service, and certain sweet
meats were poured upon his head, which for that reason were called rata zúrvata . But I do not find that this ceremony was practised in other
places; though, in all countries, slaves were bought and sold like other commodities. The Thracians are particularly remarkable for purchasing
them with salt, and therefore they were called Ilgos áròs nyopaopéva. Eustathius adds, that 'Adávnta douaegsee signified those that were bought at a very low rate. The Chians are reported to have been the first that
gave money for slaves, whereas before they had usually been exchanged for other commodities, which was the ancient way of trading before the

Whence it appears, that the barbarous oppression and cruelty used to wards slaves was not an effect of the pride of later ages, but practised in
the most primitive aud simple times : how long it continued is not certain . Adrian is said to have been the first who took away from masters the
power of putting their slaves to death without being called to account for it. In the reign of Nero, and other cruel emperors of Rome, the mas
ters were forced to give them civil treatment, lest they should accuse them as persons disaffected to the government.
But the growth of Christianity in the world seems to have put a final period to that unlimited power which lords in former ages claimed over their slaves ; for the Christians behaved themselves with mildness and gentleness towards them ; partly to encourage them to embrace the Chris
tian religion , the propagating of which they aimed at more than the pro motion of their own private interests ; and partly, because they thought it
barbarous and unnatural, that persons endued by nature with the same powers and faculties, the same tempers and inclinations, with themselves, should be treated with no more kindness than those creatures which are
without reason , and have no power to reflect on their own condition , nor to be sensible of the miseries they lie under.

1. XrigoTONTOì, were such as received their dignity from the people, met together in a lawful assembly, which on this occasion was held in the Pnyx ; and were so called from the manner of their election , in which the people gave their votes by holding up their hands.
2. Kanpuroi, were those that owed their promotion to lots, which were (drawn by the thesmothetæ in Theseus' temple. But it must be observed ,
that no person was permitted to try his fortune by the lots, unless he had been first approved by the people, who likewise reserved to themselves a power to appoint whom they pleased, without referring the decision to lots ; and thus Aristides was nominated to the office of archon . The man ner of casting lots was thus: - The name of every candidate inscribed
upon a table of brass being put into an urn , together with beans, the
choice fell upon those persons whose tablets were drawn out with white beans. If any man threw more than one tablet into the urn , he suffered capital punishment.1
3. Aiperol, were extraordinary officers, appointed by particular tribes
or boroughs, to take care of any business ; such were the surveyors of the public works, and such like.
According to Solon's constitutions no man was capable of being a magistrate, except he was possessed of a considerable estate ; but by Aris tides's means the poorer sort were admitted to a share in the govern ment, and every free denizen rendered capable of appearing for the high
est preferments. Yet such was the modesty of the commons, that they left the chief offices, and such as the care of the commonwealth depended
upon , persons of superior quality, aspiring no higher than the manage
ment of petty and trivial business . Yet they seem to have been after
wards made incapable of bearing offices. Plutarch, in the life of Phocion, mentions some who were άποψηφισθέντες του πολιτεύματος διά την πενίαν,, incapable of the government by reason of their poverty. Neither is it
improbable , that as different factions and interests became prevalent,
sometimes the nobility admitted the commons to a participation of em ployments and offices, and sometimes again excluded them. But though no man's quality or condition could exempt him from bear
ing public offices, yet his course of life and behaviour might; for if any man had lived a vicious and scandalous life, he was thought unworthy of
the meanest office, it being improbable that a person who could not behave
himself so as to gain ' reputation in a private capacity, should be able to
demean himself prudently and wisely in a public station ; or, that he, who had neglected his own concerns, or failed in the management of them , should be capable of undertaking public business, and providing for the commonwealth . Before any man therefore was admitted to a public em
ployment, he was obliged to give an account of himself and his past life,

concemned affairs which belonged to the popular assembly, they referred thither. If it was about injuries committed, it was brought before the

make his appearance , he was punished with (ietspie ) infamy. This was the method of examining into the behaviour of magistrates

This being over , the rest of the assembly, to whom the magistrate ap

solemn festival, which, from the occasion, had the name of Eiontágice, and was celebrated with all the expressions of mirth and joy usual on such
occasions. Sacrifices were offered to the gods by the senators, and most of the other magistrates; and prayers made for the prosperity of the city, in the chapel of Jupiter and Minerva the Counsellors.?
CHAP. XII .
OF THE NINE ARCHONS, &c.
The chief magistrates of Athens were nine in number, and had all the
common name of Archontes, or rulers. They were elected by lots, but
were not admitted to their offices till they had undergone a twofold trial, one in the senate-house, called aváxgions, and a second in the forum, called
doxsuaria . The questions which the senate proposed to them were such as these, Whether they were descended from ancestors that had been citi
zens of Athens for three generations ? Of what tribe and hundred they
were , and whether they bore any relation to Apollo Patrius and Jupiter Herceus ? Whether they had been dutiful to their parents, had served
in the wars, and had a competent estate ?3 Lastly, Whether they were apsažīs, perfect in all the members of their bodies ? it being otherwise un lawful for them to be archons. Some are of opinion , that the same ques
tions were demanded of all other magistrates . We must not omit in this place, that by the forementioned question concerning their relation to
Apollo Patrius and Jupiter Herceus, was inquired whether they were
freeborn citizens of Athens ( they alone being permitted to execute the office of archon) ; for all the Athenians claimed a sort of relation to these
gods. Hence we are told by the scholiast on 5 Aristophanes, that the archons honoured Apollo Patrius as their progenitor, when they were ad
mitted into their office ; έκ γαρ του μη ειδέναι, ξένους αυτούς ενόμιζον , be cause such as had no acquaintance with him were reputed forcigners. Whence that saying of Aristophanes:6

This done, they undertook their charge, some parts of which were to

citizens had given a crown, or other honour or immunity, he was to be punished with infamy (arijíc ), as guilty of a disrespect not only to the person whom he had injured, but to the whole commonwealth.4 Thus much of the nine archons in common : I shall now speak of them
severally ; only first begging leave to say, that concerning the origin of their names nothing certain is recorded ; but Sigonius conjectures, that the name of Bacidsòs, and " Agxwy, were in imitation of the chief magis

trates of former ages, wherein the city was first governed by kings, and
then by archons; and that of nohérnexos, in memory of the general of
the army, an officer usually created by the first kings, to assist them in times of war. The Osopotétas, as the name imports, seem to have been
constituted in behalf of the people, to protect them in the possession of their laws and liberties, from the usurpation of the other archons, whose power before Solon's regulation of the commonwealth , seems to have been
far greater and more unbounded than afterwards; for by that lawgiver it
was ordered , that their offices should chiefly consist in these things which follow : " Açxwv, so called by way of eminence, was chief of the nine, and is
sometimes named 'Etúrupes, because the year took its denomination from him. His jurisdiction reached both ecclesiastical and civil affairs. It was his business to determine all causes betwixt men and their wives ;
concerning wives brought to bed after the death of their husbands ; con cerning wills and testaments ; concerning dowries and legacies ; to take care of orphans, and provide tutors and guardians for them ; to hear the complaints of such as had been injured by their neighbours, and to punish such as were addicted to drunkenness ; also to take the first cognizance
of some public actions, such as those called sidarysaías, páoais , éydsigsus, longhosts. He kept a court of judicature in the Odeum , where trials
about victuals and other necessaries were brought before him . It was his duty also to appoint curators, called 'Etipesantai, to make provision for
the celebration of the feasts called Διονύσια , and Θαργήλια, wiflu some other solemnities ; to regulate stage plays, and to provide singers, choris ters, and other necessaries for them . He was to be punished with death,
if convicted of being overcome with drink during the time of his office .
Baoirsùs, had a court of judicature in the royal portico, where he de cided all disputes which happened amongst the priests, and the sacred families, such as were the Ceryces, Eteobutadæ, &c. to whom certain
offices in the celebration of divine worship belonged by inheritance . Such also as were accused of impiety, or profanation of any of the mysteries,
temples, or other sacred things, were brought before him . It was his business to assist in the celebration of the Eleusinian and Lenæan festi
vals, and all those in which they ran races with torches in their hands, yiz. Parathenæa, Hephæstia, and Promethea ; and to offer public sacrifi
ces for the safety and prosperity of the commonwealth . It was required that his wife, whom they termed Bacinord , should be a citizen of the
whole blood of Athens, and a virgin , which was likewise enjoined by the Jewish law to the high priest; otherwise neither of them was duly quali fied to preside over the mysteries and rites of their several religions.
Besides this, he had some concernment in secular affairs ; for disputes about inanimate things were brought before him ; as also accusations of

lonípagxos, had under his care all the strangers and sojourners in Athens, and exercised the same authority over them which was used by
the archon towards the citizens. It was his duty to offer a solemn sacri
fice to Enyalius (who is by some taken for Mars, by others for one of his
attendants), and another to Diana, surnamed 'Aygotipa, from one of the Athenian boroughs; to celebrate the exequies of the famous patriot Har modius, and to take care that the children of those men that had lost their
lives in their country's service should have a competent maintenance out of the public exchequer.
But because these three magistrates were often , by reason of their youth, not so well skilled in the laws and customs of their country as
might have been wished , that they might not be left wholly to themselves, it was customary for each of them to make choice of two persons of age, gravity, and reputation , to sit with them upon the bench , and direct them
as there was occasion . These they called ITágedgol, or assessors, and obliged them to undergo the same probation in the senate -house, and puh lic forum , with the other magistrates ; and like them too, to give an ac
count how they had behaved themselves in their respective trusts, when their offices expired.
The six remaining archons were called by one common name, Ofe pot'étab. They received complaints against persons guilty of false accu
sations, of calumniating, of bribery, of impiety, which also was part of the hing's office, but with this difference, that the accusers did only paívesy Toy isabă, inforın against the impious by word of mouth at the king's tribunal ;
whereas, before the thesmothetæ , they did ygépeiv, deliver their indict ment in writing, and prosecute the criminal. Also all causes and dis
putes between the citizens and strangers, sojourners, or slaves, and con troversies about trade and merchandise, were brought before them ,
Appeals to the people were preferred, the public examination of several of the magistrates performed , and the suffrages in public assemblies taken by them . They ratified all public contracts and leagues, appointed the days upon which the judges were to sit and hear causes in their several courts of judicature; took care that no laws should be established but such
as conduced to the safety and prosperity of the commonwealth , and pro secuted those that endeavoured to seduce the unwary multitude, and per
suade them to give their consent to what was contrary to the interest of the commonwealth.
Edduvos, were ten officers appointed to assist the archons, to pass the accounts of the magistrates, and to set a fine upon such as they found to

have embezzled the public treasure , or any way injured the commonwealth by their mal-administration. Aristotle tells us they were sometimes
called 'Εξετασται, and Συνήγοροι, and others will have them to be the same with the orlotad; but these are by Aristotle said to be distinguished from them .

01 dexa , the eleven , so called from their number, were elected out of
the body of the people, each of the ten tribes sending one ; to which there was added a reapere acteòs, or register, to make up the number ; sometimes
they were called Novopúa axes, keepers of the laws, which appellation was taken from their office, being in some things not unlike that of our sheriffs, for they were to see malefactors put to execution , and had the
charge of such as were committed to the public prison . They had also
power to seize thieves, kidnappers, and highwaymen, upon suspicion ;
and if they confessed the fact, to put them to death ; if not, they were obliged to prosecute them in a judicial way .
Þúragxo1, were magistrates that presided over the Athenian tribes, one of which was allotted to each of them. Afterwards this name became
peculiar to a military command ; and the governors of tribes were called 'Erripsantaà Quaw . Their business was to take care of the public trea sure which belonged to each tribe, to manage all their concerns, and call them together to consult, as often as any thing happened which required
the presence of the whole body. Quaobaosasīs, seem to have had in most things the same office, with
respect to particular tribes, that the Baciasùs had with respect to the com monwealth . They were chosen out of the Evrurgidas, or nobility, had the care of public sacrifices, and other divine worship peculiar to their respective tribes, and kept their court in the portico called Bacíasuov, and Sometimes in the Βουκολεύον ..
Φρατρίαρχοι , and Tριττύαρχοι, had in the several φρατρίαι And Tριττύες the same power that the þúzagxos exercised over the whole tribe. Ahuagxon, had the same offices in the años, took care of their revenues, out of which they paid all the duties required of them, assembled the people in the boroughs under their jurisdiction , all whose names they had written in a register, and presided at the election of senators and other magistrates chosen by lot. Sometimes we find them called Naúxpapou,
and the boroughs Navugagiai, because each of them was obliged , besides two horsemen, to furnish out one ship for the public service .

Angicoxon, were six in chief, but were assisted by thirty inferior officers,
in laying fines upon such as came not to public assemblies, and making scrutiny amongst those that were present: such also as were busy in the market they compelled to leave their buying and selling, and attend on
the public business ; the which they did by the help of the Toğórai, who were certain inferior officers, or rather servants, much like the Roman
lictors, and our sheriffs' liverymen , bailiffs, &c. The city of Athens had a thousand of them , that lived in tents erected in the middle of the forum ,
and were afterwards removed to the areopagus. Their name seems to have been taken from the arms they usually carried with them, in the same
manner that the lifeguards of kings are called Aggupógon. Sometimes they are called Antónion 'Eróntai, a name which was taken from their offices ;
sometimes Tevoivos, from Peusinus, one of the primitive Athenians, that
either first instituted this office, or gave rules for the ordering of it ; and sometimes Exúben, from the country of Scythia ; for generally men of that
country were chosen into this place, as being brawny sturdy fellows: and
therefore one of them is introduced by Aristophanes, speaking in an umcouth and barbarous manner. But to return to the Lexiarchi : they
were the persons that had the keeping of the λεξιαρχικών γραμματείον, or asúzwa, or public register of the whole city , in which were written the
names of all the citizens, as soon as they came to be of age to enter upon their paternal inheritance, which they called angus. Noxopúraxss, were officers, whose business it was to see that neither the
magistrates nor common people made any innovation upon the laws, and to punish the stubborn and disobedient . To this end, in public assem
blies they had seats appointed with the Ngósdgn, that they might be ready to oppose any man that should act contrary to the laws and received cus
toms, or promote any thing against the public good. As a token of the honourable station they were placed in, they always wore a white ribband in the solemn games and public shows, and had chairs erected for them over against those of the nine archons.
Novodítes, were a thousand in number, who were commonly chosen by
lot out of such as had been judges in the court Helixea. Their office was not, as the name seems to imply , to enact new laws by their own authority , for that could not be done without the approbation of the senate, and the
people's ratification , but to inspect the old ; and, if they found any of them useless or prejudicial, as the state of affairs then stood , or contradictory to
others, they caused them to be abrogated by an act of the people. Besides
this, they were to take care that no man should plough or dig deep ditches within the Pelasgian wall, to apprehend the offenders, and send them to the archon .

The treasurers and general receivers of Athens were of several sorts ; but
before I proceed to give an account of their offices, it will be necessary to premise a word or two concerning the public revenues ;' which are, by the accurate Sigonius, divided into the four following sorts :

contributions to enable them to carry on the war, in case, as was feared, the enemy should make a new invasion upon them. The first collector of this tax was Aristides, who ( as Plutarch reports in his life) assessed all
particular persons, town by town, according to every man's ability ; and the sum raised by him amounted to four hundred and sixty talents. To
this Pericles added near a third part ( proceeds my author ) ; for Thucy dides reports, that in the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, the Atheni ans had coming in from their. confederates six hundred talents. After
Pericles's death , the orators and men powerful amongst the people , pro ceeded to increase it by little and little , till it amounted to one thousand and
three hundred talents ; and that not so much because of the extraordinary
expensiveness of the wars, as by exciting the people to largesses, playhouse expenses, and the erecting of statues and temples. 3. Eio pogai, were taxes laid upon the citizens, as well as sojourners, and freed servants, by order of the assembly and senate , for the defraying of

care of the money allowed for shows, had the power of letting out the tribute -money, and other public revenues, and selling estates that were
confiscated ; all which bargains were ratified in the name of their presi dent. Besides this, it was their office to convict such as had not paid their tribute, called pistoíxıov, and sell them by auction. Under these
were certain inferior officers, called ' ExLoytīs, whose business it was to collect the public money, for such as had leases of the city's revenues, whom they called Tsūves ; these were always persons of good credit themselves, and besides their own bonds, were obliged to give other
security for the payment of the money due according to their leases ; in which, if they failed any longer than till the ninth Prytanea, they were
under a forfeiture of twice the principal, to be paid by themselves or their sureties ; upon neglect of which, they were all cast into prison, and their estates confiscated. After the expulsion of the thirty tyrants, certain
officers called súvdixos, were created, with power to take cognizance of all complaints about the confiscation of goods, as appears from an oration of Lysias in behalf of Nicias.
'Erıygapīs, were officers that rated all those of whom taxes and contri

'Arodbxtc ., were ten general receivers, to whom all the public revenues,
contribution -money, and debts owed to the public were paid ; which done, they registered all their receptions, and crossed out of the public debt -book such as had discharged their debts, in the presence of the whole senate.
If any controversy happened about the money or taxes, they had power to decide it, unless it was a difficult or knotty point, or of high concern ; for
such they referred to the hearing of some of the courts of judicature,

'Αντιγραφεύς της διοικήσεως , seems to have been one that kept a coun terpart of the chief treasurer's accounts, to preserve them from being falsified or corrupted.
Tæuías tūv otPOTIWTixūv, was the paymaster -general of the army. Tapées TW Jewpixūv, or 'O ini Dewgirã, had the disposal of the Oswpixà xoácetue for the uses above mentioned. But the greatest and most
troublesome part of his office consisted in distributing them to the poor citizens, to buy seats in the theatre : which custom was first begun and enacted into a law by Pericles, to ingratiate himself with the common
alty :' for as Libanius observes, in the primitive ages of the commonwealth , when the theatres were composed of wood , the people being eager of
getting places, used to quarrel among themselves, and sometimes beat and wound one another ; to prevent which inconvenience, it was ordered that
every one, before he entered into the theatre, should pay two oboli, or a drachm according to Harpocration , for admittance ; and lest by this means the poorer sort should be deprived of the pleasure of seeing, every man was allowed to demand that sum of the public exchequer.

OF THE ATHENIAN MAGISTRATES .
EITONAI, were so called from their office, which was to lay in corn for the use of the city ; and to this end the Tanías tñs doorxúciws was to furnish
them with as much money as they had occasion for. Athens was seated in a barren and unfruitful country, which was not able to furnish its own
inhabitants with necessary provisions, whereby they were forced to fetch corn from foreign nations, and supply their own wants by the superfluities of others; and this it was that caused them to institute this office .
ElTopúranes, were fifteen in number, ten of whom officiated in the city, and five in the Piræeus ; their business was to take care that corn and
meal should not be sold at too dear a price and to appoint the assize of bread. Nearly related to these were the Σιτομίτραι , Or 'Αποδεκταίοι , whose office was to see that the measures of corn were just and equal.
'Agopavómot, sometimes termed sovietai, were ten in number, five belonging to the city, and as many to the Piræeus. Others make them
fifteen ; ten whereof they give to the city, and five to the Piraeus, which
was reckoned a third part of Athens. To these men a certain toll or tribute was paid by all those who brought any thing to sell in the market:
whence Dicæopolis is introduced by Aristophanes, demanding an eel of a Bæotian for the rikos tñs dryopãs, toll of the market :

This thou shalt give me for toll of the market ; for their business lay in
the market, where they had the care of all vendibles, except corn ; and were especially obliged to see that no man wronged, or any way circum vented another in buying or selling.'
Mirgovópos, were officers that inspected all sorts of measures, except those of corn ; there were five of them in the city, and double that number
in the Piræeus, in which the greatest mart in Attica was kept.
'Oyorópos, were officers who took care of the fish -market. They were two or three in number, and chosen by the senate. Their name is
derived from you, which, though originally of a more general signification, is many times appropriated to fish. Thus, Plutarch has informed us :
Πολλών όντων όψων, εκνενίκηκεν ο ιχθύς μόνον, και μάλιστα γε όψον καλείσθαι " Many other things being called Xce, that name is nevertheless now applied only, or chiefly , to fish : whence ofágoor is used in that sense by St John.
' Eurogiou itipentaż, were officers that belonged to the haven ; they were ten in number, and the chief part of their business ws; to take care
that two parts at least of all the corn which was brought into the port
should be carried into the city, and that no silver should be exported by any private person , except such as designed to trade in corn .
Ναυτοδίκαι , or 'Υβριστοδίκαι, had cognizance of controversies that hap pened between merchants and mariners, and examined persons, that, being the children of strangers both by the father and mother's side, had
by fraud inserted their names into the public register, thereby claiming the privileges of freeborn citizens ; this they did upon the 26th of every month . Not much different from these were the ' Eraywycīs, according
to Sigonius and Emmius's account of them ; only they were to hear such causes in matters of trade as required despatch, and could not be deferred
to the monthly sessions of the Næutodixes. But Pollux tells us, that be sides those trials, they had cognizance of controversies about feasts and public entertainments .
'Asturópos, were officers who took care of the streets, and several other
things, especially such as any way concerned the streets, high te tão avan
Tgíowy, xai xorgonóywv, xoà tôn Tootwy, of the minstrels and singers, and scavengers, and such like. 'Aristotle , as he is cited by Harpocration , makes ten astynomi, five in the city, and as many in the Piræeus. But Samuel Petitus enlarges their number, as likewise that of the agoranomi, to fifteen ; ten of whom he would have to officiate in the city, and five in the Piræeus, which was never accounted more than a third part of
Athens; and therefore he thinks that the numbers in Harpocration have
been by some accident or other changed . But as this is no certain way of arguing, so it is not improbable that the Piræeus, though only a third ens, yet being a very great and celebrated mart might find
employment for as many agoranomi and astynomi as the other two parts.

We are informed by ' Demosthenes that no man served in this office oítener than once .
'
odorooi,

ways.
'ETITÚTO Tūv údátwy, were those that took care of the aqueducts, and other conveyances of water ; but the fountains belonged to other officers,
called Konvo úraxes. The offices of these four are by Aristotle compre hended under the name of αστυνομία ..
'Επιστάται των δημοσίων έργων, were officers with whom were intrusted the care, contrivance, and management of all public edifices, except the city walls, for which there were peculiar curators, called from their offices TEIXOH 0101,whose number was usually the same with that of the tribes, every one of which had the choice of one Toyotolòs, as often as occasion required. Ewogaviotal, were ten in number, and, as their name imports, took care that the young men behaved themselves with sobriety and moderation .?
For this same end, the thesmothetæ used to walk about the city in the
night time, and correct such as they found committing any disorder.3 Oivór tai, were three officers that provided lights and torches at the
public entertainments, and took care that every man drank his due pro portion ."
Tuvairovópos, also had an office at public feasts, sacrifices, marriages, and
other solemnities, and took care that nothing should be done contrary to custom .
Tureiroxéopos, were magistrates, whose business it was to regulate the
women's apparel, according to the rules of modesty and decency, and set a fine upon such as were too nice and fantastical in their dresses, which they exposed to public view in the Ceramicus.
Agitougyol, were persons of considerable estates, who by their own tribe , or the whole people, were ordered to perform some public duty , or supply the commonwealth with necessaries at their own expenses. Of these there
were several sorts , all which were elected out of twelve hundred of the richest citizens, who were appointed by the people to undergo, when they should be required, all the burdensome and chargeable offices in the com
monwealth, every tribe electing a hundred and twenty out of their own body, though , as Sigonius has observed, this was contrary to Solon's con stitution , by which every man, of what quality soever, was obliged to serve the public according to his ability, with this exception only , that two offices should not be imposed on the same person at once, as we are
informed by Demosthenes in his oration against Leptines, where he like wise mentions an ancient law, requiring every man to undergo some of the astougyive every second year.

which
were

They
were
again
subdivided
into
two
parts
,
according
to
the
estates
of
the
persons
that
composed
them
;
and
thus
,
out
of
the
first
ten
ouppeopícı
were
appointed
three
hundred
of
the
most
wealthy
citizens
in
Athens,
who
,
upon
all
exigencies,
were
to
furnish
the
commonwealth
with
necessary
supplies
of
money
,
and
together
with
the
rest
of
the
twelve
hundred
were
required
to
perforin
all
extraordinary
duties
in
their
turns
.
The
institution
of
these
ouppogías
happened
about
the
third
year
of
the
100th
Olympiad
,
Nausinicus
being
archon
.
Before
that
time,
such
as
were
unable
to
bear
the
expense
of
any
autougyice
assigned
to
them
,
had
relief
from
the
avridoris
,
or
exchange
of
goods
,
which
was
one
of
Solon's
inventions,
and
performed
in
the
following
manner
:
If
If any person appointed to undergo one of the autouerías, or duties, could find another citizen of better substance than himself, who was free from all the duties, then the informer was excused . But in case
the person thus substituted in the other's place denied himself to be the richest, then they exchanged estates in this manner : The doors of their
houses were close shut up and sealed, lest any thing should be carried thence. Then both the men took the following oath : 'Aropaíva ording
ουσίαν την εμαυτού ορθώς και δικαίως , πλην των εν τοις έργοις τοις άργυρείοις, όσα και νόμος ατελή πεποιήκασι: I will truly and faithfully discover all my substance, except that which lies in the silver mines, which the laws have excusedfrom all imposts and taxes . Then within three days a full
discovery was made of their whole estates, and this was termed årópaois.
Neither was this custom wholly laid aside upon the institution of the fore mentioned ovu pogías ; but then and afterwards, if any one of the three hundred citizens could give information of any other person more wealthy
than himself, who had been passed by in the nomination , the informer was excused . This whole controversy was termed deadıxadia , the sense of which word is so much enlarged by some, as to be equivalent to the general terms, xgions and il pepoßhandis ;3 and by others is restrained to
the controversies happening between the zoongoi, though perhaps these may be taken in general for the autougyol, one remarkable part being put for the whole. This must be observed farther, that if any controversy
happened between such as were appointed rongaexo, it was to be brought before the otparnyòs, who had the care of all warlike preparations, and by him to be referred to the customary judges ; the rest of the deadıxacius seem to have belonged to other magistrates.
Of the duties to be undergone in the fore-mentioned matters, some concerned the affairs of peace, others related to those of war . The duties
of peace were chiefly three, χορηγία, γυμνασιαρχία and εστίασις . Those of war were two, τριηραρχία and εισφορά .

cians, as oft as there was occasion for them at the celebration of their publie festivals, and solemnities.? rupescolagxos, were at the charge of the oil, and such like necessaries
for the wrestlers, and other combatants.2
'Eotiétages Tūv puaãv, were such as, upon public festivals, made an
entertainment for the whole tribe. Besides those who were appointed
by lots to this office, others voluntarily undertook it, to ingratiate them selves. It may be farther observed , that the m'étoix01, sojourners, had
also their sotiátoges, by whom they were entertained . Terngagxos, were obliged to provide all sorts of necessaries for the fleet,
and to build ships. To this office no certain number of men was nomiii
ated ; but their number was increased or diminished according to the
value of their estates, and the exigencies of the commonwealth . Elopigoytes, were required , according to their abilities, to supply the
public with money for the payment of the army, and other occasions..
Besides these, upon extraordinary occasions, when the usual supplies were not sufficient, as in times of long and dangerous wars, the rich citi
zens used generously to contribute as much as they were able to the pub
lic necessities, besides what was required of them and could not be avoid ed These are by Pollux called επιδίδοντες , επιδόσεις, εισφέροντες, εκόντες ,
εθελονται, &c.
Others there were, who were not properly magistrates, yet because
they were employed in public business, must not be omitted in this place. Such were the oúvdixos, or orators, appointed by the people, to plead in
behalf of any law which was to be abrogated or enacted, of whom I have spoken in another place. These men, though differing from those who
are next to be mentioned , were sometimes termed phragss, and ourńyogos, and their fee, rò ournyogixóv. Lest this office, which was created for the benefit of the commonwealth, should be abused to the private advantage of particular men , there was a law enacted, whereby the people were pro hibited from conferring it twice upon the same person .?
'Pútoges, were ten in number, elected by lots, to plead public causes in the senate -house or assembly ; and for every cause wherein they were
retained , they received a drachm out of the public exchequer. They were sometimes called συνήγοροι, and their fee , το συνηγορικόν.8 No man
was admitted to this office under the age of forty years:' though others
think it was lawful to plead both in the senate -house and before the public assembly at the age of thirty. Neither were they permitted to execute this office till their valour in war, piety to their parents, prudence in the man
agement of affairs, frugality, and temperance, had been examined into. The heads of which examination are set down amongst the laws of Athens.

Tipíoßeis, were ambassadors chosen by the senate, or most commonly by the suffrages of the people, to treat with foreign states. Sometimes they were sent with full power to act according as they should judge most
conducive to the safety and honour of the commonwealth, and then they
were Tipéoßers atroxpúrogts, or plenipotentiaries, and were not obliged at their return home to render an account of their proceedings: but their
power was usually limited, and they were liable to be called in question if they exceeded their commission , by concluding any business besides
what they were sent about, or in any other manner than what was pre seribed them. During the time of their employment they received a salary out of the exchequer. Whether that was always the same does
not certainly appear ; but it is more probable that, like the pay of soldiers, and other salaries, it was first very small, and afterwards, when the com monwealth flourished with trade and riches, raised to a greater value. When Euthymenes was archon, they received every day two drachms:

The Igéoßers were usually attended by a rñqu's, or herald ; and some times the rhguxss were sent upon embassies by themselves, as Sigonius
observes, especially in the primitive times, when all embassies were per formed by these men , who were accounted sacred and inviolable, not only
as being descended from Mercury, and employed in his office, but because they were public mediators, without whom all intercourse and hopes of reconcilement between enemies must be at an end. Therefore, as Eusta
thius observes, whenever Ulysses in his travels despatched his scouts to discover what sort of country and people the winds and seas had brought them to, he always sent a xñguš along with them, whereby they were secured from receiving any harm in all parts of the world whither they
were driven, except in the countries of the Læstrygones, Cyclopes, and such savages as were altogether void of humanity.
rpojepattīs, notaries, were of several sorts, and employed by several magistrates ; concerning whom this may be observed in general, that for the prevention of fraud , and deceit, a law was enacted, ua mis dis 'to.

records, which it was their business to write and to repeat to the people and
senate when so required. These were three in number: one chosen by the popular assembly, whose business was to recite before the people or senate ; and two appointed by the senate, one whereof was keeper of the
laws, another of other public records. The custom was for a notary to be appointed by every Prytanea , who laid down his office at the end of
thirty days, and then underwent the accustomed ( sidúrn) examination.2
It may not be improper to add in this place, that at Syracuse the office of notaries was very honourable , but at Athens, reputed súrsins úningsría , a mean employment, and executed by those who are called by the Greeks
onuórios, by the Roman lawyers, vulgares, or , as that word is explained , calones. These were commonly slaves, who had learned to read and
write, that they might thereby become the more serviceable to their mas
ters.4 One of these was that Nicomachus, against whom Lysias wrote his oration ,
Besides the forementioned magistrates and officers, there were several others, as the Ilgurávsis, Ilgósdgon, &c. But of these, and such as had military commands, or were employed in the divine service, I shall give an account in their proper places,
CHAP. XVI.
OF THE COUNCIL OF THE AMPHICTYONES .
Being in the next place to speak of the Athenian councils, and courts of
justice, I cannot omit the famous council of the Amphietyones ; which though it sat not at Athens, nor was peculiar to that city, yet the Atheni ans, and almost all the rest of the Greeks, were concerned in it.
It is commonly thought to have been first instituted by Amphictyon , the son of Deucalion ;5 but Strabo is of opinion that Acrisius, king of the
Argives, was the first that founded and gave laws for the conduct and
management of it ;6 and then it must have its name from 'Appiationssy because the inhabitants of the countries round about met in that council :'
Androtian in Pausanias tells us, that the primitive name of those senators was Amphictiones ; however in later ages it hath been changed into
Amphictyones. But the former opinion receives confirmation from what
Herodotus reports of the place where this council was assembled , that is, that it was a temple dedicated to Amphictyon and Ceres Amphictyoneis and Strabo also reports, that this goddess was worshipped by the Amphic tyones.

The persons that first composed this assembly by the appointment of
Amphictyon , were , according to Pausanias, the representatives of the Ionians, amongst whom the Athenians were included , Dolopians, Thes salians, Ænianians, Magnesians, Melians, Phthians, Dorians, Phocians, and the Locrians, who lived near Mount Cnemis, and were called upon
that account Epicnemidii. Strabo reports, that at their first institution they were twelve in number, and were delegated by so many cities .
Harpocration also, and Suidas, reckon up twelve nations of which this
council consisted, that is, Ionians, Dorians, Perrhoebians, Boeotians, Magnesians, Achæans, Phthians, Melians, Dolopians, Ænianians, Del
phians, Phocians. Æschines reckons only eleven ; instead of the Achæans,
Ænianians, Delphians, and Dolopians, placing these three only, namely , Thessalians, Etæans, and Locrians,3
Afterwards, in the time of Philip king of Macedon , and father of Alex .
ander the Great, the Phocians, having ransacked and spoiled the Delphian temple, were by a decree of the Amphictyones invaded by the rest of the
Greeks, as a sacrilegious and impious nation , and after a ten years' war, deprived of the privilege of sitting amongst them , together with their
allies the Lacedæmonians, who were one part of the Dorians, and under
that name, had formerly sat in this assembly ; and their vacant places were supplied by the Macedonians, who were admitted, in return for the good services they had done in the Phocian war. But about sixty -eight
years after, when the Gauls, under the command of Brennus, made a
terrible invasion upon Greece, ravaging and destroying all before them , sparing nothing sacred or profane, and with a barbarous and sacrilegious fury, robbed and despoiled the Delphian temple, the Phocians behaved
themselves with so much gallantry , signalizing themselves in the battle above the rest of the Greeks, that they were thought to have made a sufficient atonement for their former offence, and were restored to their
ancient privilege and dignity .* In the reign of Augustus Cæsar, they suffered another alteration ; for that emperor, having vanquished Antony in a sea -fight at Actium , and in

memory of that victory, founded the city of Nicopolis, was desirous that
its inhabitants should be admitted into this assembly, and to make way for them , ordered that the Magnesians, Melians, Phthians, and Æniani ans, who, till that time had distinct voices, should be numbered with the
Thessalians, and send no representatives but such as were common to them all; and that the right of suffrage, which formerly belonged to those nations, and the Dolopians ( a people whose state and name were extinct
long before), should be given to the Nicopolitans .
Strabo, who flourished in the reign of Augustus and Tiberius, reports
that this council, as also the general assembly of the Achæans, was at that time dissolved ; but Pausanias, who lived many years after, under Anto ninus Pius, assures us, that in his time it remained entire, and that the number of the amphictyones was then thirty, being delegated by the fol lowing nations, namely, the Nicopolitans, Macedonians, Thessalians,
Boeotians (who in former times were called Æolians, and inhabited some parts of Thessaly ), Phocians, Delphians, Locrians, called Ozolæ , with
those that lie opposite to Euboea, Dorians, Athenians, and Euboeans.
This assembly had every year only two set meetings, one in the begin ning of spring, the other in autumn, except some extraordinary occasion called them together. The design of their meetings was to determine
public quarrels, and decide the differences that happened between any of
the cities of Greece, when no other means were left to compose them . Before they entered upon business, they jointly sacrificed an ox, cut into
small pieces, to Delphian Apollo, thereby signifying the union and agreement of the cities which they represented . Their determinations were always received with a great deal of respect and veneration , and held
inviolable ; the Greeks being always ready to join against those that rejected them, as common enemies.
An assembly of neighbouring cities, met to consult about the common

the

of

called

,
and
the
other
Σύγκλητος
.
Κυρίαι, were so called , από του κυρείν τα ψηφίσματα , because in them the people confirmed and ratified the decrees of the senate ; or rather
because they were held upon ημέραι κυρίαι, οι ώρισμέναι και νόμιμοι , days stated and appointed by law . ?
They were held four times in five -and -thirty days, which was the time that each aguráveic, or company of prytanes, presided in the senate. The first assembly was employed in approving and rejecting magistrates, in hearing actions called sirayysics, and proposals concerning the public good ; as also in hearing the catalogue of such possessions, as were confis
cated for the service of the commonwealth, and several other things. The second made provision both for the community and private persons ; and
it was permitted every man to prefer any petition , or speak his judgment concerning either of them . In the third, audience was given to the
ambassadors of foreign states. The fourth was wholly taken up with religion , and matters relating to divine worship . At this time the pry tanes, who were obliged Iúsi éxártote xovs, every day to offer sacrifices
for the public safety , seem to have acquainted the assembly with the suc cess of their devotions after this manner : " It is just and meet, O Athe
nians, as has been customary with you , that we should take care that the gods be religiously worshipped. We have therefore faithfully discharged
this duty for you. We have sacrificed to Jupiter the Saviour, to Minerva, to Victory ; all which oblations have been accepted for your safety. We have likewise offered sacrifices to Persuasion ( Ilsid ), to the Mother of the gods, to Apollo , which have met with the like good success . Also the
sacrifices offered to the rest of the gods, have been all secure and accept
able, and salutiferous: receive therefore the happiness which the gods have vouchsafed to grant you,” The first assembly was upon the eleventh day of the Prytanea ; the second upon the twentieth ; the third upon the thirtieth ; the fourth upon the thirty -third . Some there are that reckon
by the month, and tell us that they had three assemblies every month , upon the first, tenth , and thirtieth days ; or upon the tenth, twentieth, and thirtieth . But the former computation seems to be more agreeable to
the custom of the ancient Athenians, amongst whom were ten figuraveias, accordiug to the number of their tribes, each of which ruled thirty -five
days, in which they had four assemblies. Afterwards, the number of the

tribes being increased by an accession of two new ones, the Ilgvravíc. were also twelve in number, each of which ruled a month, and then per
haps the latter computation might take place, Σύγκλητοι εκκλησίαι, were so called, από του συγκαλεϊν , because the
people were summoned together; whereas in the Kugías, they met of their
own accord , without receiving any notice from the magistrates, as Ulpian observes, The persons that summoned the people, were commonly the
Erfarngoi, the Iloréu agxos, or the Kúgures in their names, because the
occasion of these extraordinary assemblies was, for the most part, the coming on of some sudden, unexpected, and dangerous war ; sometimes
the prytanes, if the senate so ordered it, as they usually did when any
civil affairs, in which the Srpatnyol were not concerned , required a quicker despatch than could be given them in the rugía . The crier (rñguğ) seems to have summoned them twice at the least: whence in Aristophanes it is said to be full time to go to the assembly, because the
crier had given the second call :
eΏρα βαδίζειν, ώς ο κήρυξ αρτίως, 'Tis the hour to go, just now the herald, Ημών προτιόντων, δεύτερον κεκόκκοκιν While we advance, proclaimed his second call.
Κατεκκλησίαι , as Pollux , κατακλήσεις , as Ammonius , or κατακλησίαι , as Hesychius calls them, were assemblies held up some very weighty and
momentous affair, to which they summoned not only those citizens that
resided in the city, but all that lived in the country, or were in the ships then at anchor in the haven .
The places where the exxamoics were assembled , were several ; as first,
' Ayogà, or the market-place ; and there, not the Athenians only, but most other cities, had their public meetings, because it was usually very
capacious. Hence the assemblies themselves came to be called 'Agogai, and to make a speech, kropsbur, as Harpocration observes. Ilvvž, was a place near the citadel, so called dià TÒ TITUxvwolastis
λίθοις, ή ταϊς καθέδραις, ή διά το πεπυκνώσθαι εν αυτή τους βουλευτές , be cause it was filled with stones, or seats set close together , or from the
crowds of men in the assemblies ; and therefore tvuxions is by the come dians taken for the thronging and pressing of a multitude.S . It was
remarkable for nothing more than the meanness of its buildings and furni
ture, whereby, in ages, that most affected gaiety and splendour, it remained a monument of the ancient simplicity.*

tain place, being sometimes held in the Piræeus, where there was a forum called 'Itrodapesíc eropie, in the Munychia, or any other place capacious enough to contain the people.
The
magistrates,
that
had
the
care
and
management
of
these
assemblies
,
were
the
Prytanes
,
Epistatæ
,
and
Proëdri
,
The Prytanes sometimes called the people together, and always before their meeting, set up a " górçapjice in some place of general concourse , containing the matters to be consulted upon in the following assembly, in
order that every man might have time to consider of them before he gave his judgment.
Ilgósăgos, were so called from the first places which they had in the assemblies. Whilst the tribes of Athens were no more than ten, the
proëdri were nine in number, being appointed by lots out of the nine tribes, which at that time were exempted from being prytanes. Their
business was to propose to the people the things they were to deliberate
upon , and determine in that meeting, at the end of which their offices expired. For the greater security of the laws and commonwealth from
the attempts of ambitious and designing men, it was customary for the Νομοφύλακες, in all assemblies συγκαθίζειν τους προέδρους , ένια διακωλύοντας επιχειροτονείν όσα μη συμφέρει, to sit with the proedri , and to hinder the people from decreeing any thing contrary to the public interest. By
another law , it was likewise provided that in every assembly , one of the
tribes should be appointed by lots, a gosdgsbesv, to preside at the Suggestum, to defend the communwealth, by preventing the orators and others from propounding any thing inconsistent with the received laws, or destruc
tive of the peace and welfare of the city. 'Erotárns, the president of the assembly, was chosen by lots out of the
proëdri; the chief part of his office seems to have consisted in granting
the people liberty to give their voices, which they were not permitted to do till he had given the signal."
If the people were remiss in coming to the assemblies, the magistrates used their utmost endeavours to compel them : they shut up all the gates,
that only excepted through which they were to pass to the assembly ; they took care that all vendibles should be carried out of the market, that there
might be nothing to divert them from appearing: and if this was not sufficient, the logistæ (whose business this was) took a cord dyed with vermilion , with which they detached two of the Točárou into the market, where one of them standing on one side, and another on that which was
opposite, pursued all they found there , and marked with the cord as many as they caught, all of whom had a certain fine imposed upon them . Lastly, to encourage the commonalty to frequent the assemblies, it was
decreed , at the instance of Callistratus, that an obolus should be giveni out
of the exchequer to all such as came early to the place appointed for the

assembly. This was afterwards increased to three oboli, at the instance
of Agyrrhius. The expectation of this reward drew many of the poorer sort, who would otherwise have absented themselves. Hence Aristo
phanes,' speaking of Plutus the god of money, says , 'Εκκλησία δ' ουχί διά τούτον γίγνεται ;
Is not the assembly frequented for his sake ? They who came late re ceived nothing .
If boisterous and tempestuous weather, or a sudden storm , which they called droonpsía , or earthquake happened, or any inauspicious omen appeared , the assembly was immediately adjourned. But if all things continued in their usual course , they proceeded in this manner :
First, the place where they were appointed to meet, was purified by killing young pigs, which, as was usual in such lustrations, they carried
round about the utmost bounds of it ; on the outside of which no man was
permitted to stand, because those places were accounted profane and unsanctified , and therefore unfit for transacting business of so great con sequence as that in which the welfare and safety of the state were so nearly concerned : this we learn from Aristophanes, in whom the public
crier warns the people to stand on the inside of the válagues, for so they called the sacrifices offered at expiations: Πάριθ', ώς αν εντός ήτε το καθάρματος .
Come
nigh
,
and
be
within
the
expiation
ground
.
The
person
that
officiated
in
the
lustration
was
called
Kalaptas
and
Περιστίαρχος
,
from
Περίσσια
,
another
name
for
Καθάρματα
,
and
“
Εστίαρχη
,
according
to
Pollux
.
The expiatory rites being ended, the public crier made a solemn prayer for the prosperity of the commonwealth , and the good success of their counsels and undertakings. For amongst the primitive Greeks, all things were carried on with a great show of piety and devotion ; and so great a
share they thought their gods had in the management of human'affairs, that they never undertook any thing of weight or moment, especially in
public business, without having first invoked their direction and assistance. He then pronounced a bitter execration against such as should endea
vour to do any thing in that assembly to the prejudice of the common wealth, praying that he and his whole family might be made remarkable examples of the divine vengeance .
Then the crier, the proëdri giving the command , repeated the peopoú a soud or decree of the senate, upon which the assembly was then to
deliberate. That being done, the crier proclaimed with a loud voice, Tès αγορεύειν βουλέται των υπέρ πεντήκοντα έτη γεγονότων ; Which of the men above fifty years old will make an oration ? On this the old men propounded whatever they thought convenient. After which the crier, by a second proclamation, gave them to understand, λέγειν των Αθηναίων τον βουλόμενον ois alsoti, That every Athenian might then speak, whom the laws allowed

su to do. For as they judged it unreasonable that any man's quality or age (so he were not under thirty ), should debar him from uttering what
he had conceived for the good of the commonwealth ; so , on the other
hand , it was thought very indecent and unbecoming for young men to give their opinions before they had heard the sentiments of such as years and experience had rendered more fit and able to judge.

rather
that

Wherefore
,
if

was
thought
by
the

to
be
unfit
to
make
an

,
they
enjoined
him

to the prytanes were pulled down from the suggestum by the lictors (roğóra ), as appears from another place of the same author ."
When the debates were ended, the crier, by the command of the epis
tata, or proëdri, as others report, asked the people, Whether they would consent to the decree ? permitting them to give their voices, and thereby
either establish or reject it ; the doing which they called 'Eriy noizy tò
ψήφισμα, or Διδόναι διαχειροτονίαν τώ δημ .. The manner of giving their suffiages was by holding up their hands,
and therefore they called it χειροτονία; and χειροτονείν signifies to ordain , or establish any thing; éxoysigotovsīv, to disannul by suffrage. This was the common method of voting ; but in some cases, as particularly when
they deprived magistrates of their offices for mal-administration, they gave
their votes in private, lest the power and greatness of the persons accused should lay a restraint upon them , and cause them to act contrary to their
judgments and inclinations. The manner of voting privately was by
casting pebbles (túpous) into vessels ( rádous), which the prytanes were obliged to place in the assembly for this purpose . Before the use of peb
bles they voted with (xúc poi) beans.5
As soon as the people had done voting, the proëdri having carefully
examined the number of the suffrages, pronounced the decree ratified , or thrown out, according as the major part had approved or rejected it. It

is observable, in the last place, that it was unlawful for the prytanes to propose any thing twice in the same assembly. The business being over , the prytanes dismissed the assembly .? Whoever desires to have a more full account of the popular assemblies
at Athens, may consult the Concionatrices of Aristophanes,3 where their whole management is accurately described.
CHAP. XVIII .
OF
THE
SENATE
OF
THE
FIVE
HUNDRED
.
By Solon's constitution , the whole power and management of affairs were placed in the people. It was their prerogative to receive appeals from the courts of justice ; to abrogate old laws, and enact new ; to make what alterations in the state they judged convenient; and in short , all matters,
whether public or private, foreign or domestic, civil, military , or religi ous, were determined by them.
But as it was dangerous that things of such vast moment and concern should be, without any further care, committed to the disposal and man agement of a giddy and unthinking multitude, who by eloquent men would be persuaded to enaet things contrary to their own interests, and destruc tive to the commonwealth, that wise lawgiver, to prevent such pernicious
consequences, judged it absolutely necessary for the preservation of the state to institute a great council, consisting only of men of the best credit
and reputation in the city, whose business it should be to inspect all mat ters before they were propounded to the people, and to take care that
nothing, but what had been diligently examined, should be brought before the general assembly.4 At the same time he instituted, at least regulated , another council, I mean that of the Areopagites, which , though inferior to
the former in order and power, yet was superior to it in dignity and es teem, and therefore was called in a vw Bourn, or the upper council : to this
he gave the inspection and custody of the laws, supposing that the com monwealth being held by these two, as it were by firm anchors, would be
less liable to be lost by tumults, and made a prey to such as had knavery enough to design, and cunning and eloquence to entice the people to their own destruction ,5
At the first institution of the former council, it consisted only of four hundred senators, one hundred of whom were appointed out of each tribe ; for the tribes in Solon's time were only four in number..
They were elected by lots, in drawing of which they made use of beans, and therefore Thucydides calls them Bovdeutès &rò nvárov, and the sen

ate, Bovans år ) zvépou. The manner of their election was thus :-On a
certain day , before the beginning of the month Hecatombæon , the presj . dent of every tribe gave in the pames of all the persons within his district, that were capable of this dignity, and had a mind to appear for it : these were engraven upon tablets of brass, called Ilyáxic , and cast into a vessel set there for that purpose ; into another vessel were cast the same number
of beans, a hundred of which were white, and all the rest black. Then
the names of the candidates, and the beans, were drawn one by one, and those whose names were drawn out together with the white beans were received into the senate.2.
About eighty -six years after Solon's regulation of the commonwealth , the number of tribes being increased by Clisthenes from four to ten, the senate also received an addition of one hundred, which being added to the former, made it consist of five hundred ; and from that time it was called
Βουλή των πεντακοσίων.. Afterwards two new tribes were added to the former, in honour of
Antigonus, and his son Demetrius, from whom they received their names : and then the number of the senators was augmented by the accession of another hundred ;3 for in both these last alterations, it was ordered that out of every tribe fifty should be elected into the senate. As to the man
ner of election , that continued the same, excepting only , that instead of a
hundred white beans drawn by each tribe, they had now only fifty, accord ing to the number of their senators.
After the election of senators, they proceeded in the next place to
appoint officers to preside in the senate, and these they called Ngurávsis. The manner of their election was thus :-The names of the tribes being thrown into one vessel with nine black beans, and a white bean cast into
another, the tribe whose fortune it was to be drawn out together with the white bean , presided first, and the rest in the order in which they were
drawo out of the vessel ; for every tribe presided in its turn ; and there fore, according to the number of tribes, the Attic year was divided into ten parts, each of which consisted of thirty -five days; only the four first parts contained thirty -six, thereby to make the lunar year complete, which, according to their computation, consisted of three hundred and fifty -four
days. Others are of opinion , that those four supernumerary days were
employed in the creation of magistrates, and that during that time the Athenians had no magistrates at all," and therefore they called them " Avagxos speigas, and 'Agzaspécio. Afterwards, when the tribes were in
creased to twelve, every one of them presided a full month in the sonate, as we learn from Pollux. The time that every company of prytanes con
tinued in their office was termed Tigurania , during which they were excused from all other public duties.

To prevent confusion , every liputavsia was divided into five weeks of
days, by which the fifty prytanes were ranked into five decuriæ , each de curia being to govern their week, during which time they were called
Ilgósdgos; out of these, one, whom they elected by lots, presided over the
rest, each of the seven days ; so that of the ten proëdri, three were exclud ed from presiding.
The president of the proëdri was termed ' Extérns. To his custody was committed the public seal, and the keys of the citadel, and the public
exchequer. This, therefore, being an office of so great trust and power, no man was permitted by the laws to continue in it above one day, nor to be elected into it a second time.
There are said to have been nine proëdri distinct from the former, and
chosen by the epistata at every convention of the senate, out of all the tribes, except that of which the prytanes were members. Both of these were different from the ' Etuotárns, and Igósdgon in the popular assem blies, at
One thing more there is remarkable in the election of senators, that besides those, who were immediately admitted into the senate , they chose
subsidiaries, who, in case any of the senators were deposed for mal - admin istration , or died before the expiration of their offices , should , without any
farther trouble, supply their places ; and these they called 'Extraxórtes. The authority of the prytanes consisted chiefly in assembling the senate ,
which, for the most part, was done once every day ( festivals only except, ed), and oftener, if occasion required . That they might be ready to give
audience to all such as had any thing to propose , which concerned the commonwealth , they constantly resorted to a common hall near the senate house , called Prytaneum , in which they offered sacrifices, and had their diet together .
Every time the senate was assembled, they offered sacrifices to Jupiter Boudccios, and Minerva Bovadia , the Counsellors, who had a chapel near the senate -house.5. This they termed sidirágsee Iúsis.6 If any man offered any thing that deserved to be taken into considera
tion, they engraved it upon tablets, that all the senators might beforehand
be acquainted with what was to be discussed at their next meeting, in
which, after the prytanes, or epistata , had propounded the matter , every man had liberty to declare his opinion, and give his reasons either for or against it . This they did standing ; for it is everywhere observable in
ancient authors, that no person , of what rank or quality soever, presumed to speak sitting; and therefore, whenever a poetical hero makes an oration, he is always first said to rise .7
When all had done speaking, the business designed to be passed into a
decree, was drawn up in writing by any of the prytanes, or other senators,

and repeated openly in the house ;' after which, leave being given by the
epistata, or prytanés, the senators proceeded to vote, which they did in private , by casting beans into a vessel placed there for that purpose. The beans were of two sorts, black and white ; and if the number of the former
was formd to be the greatest, the proposal was rejected ; if of the latter, it
was enacted into a decree, which they called Ψήφισμα , and Προβούλευμα, because it was agreed upon in the senate , with a design to have it after wards propounded to an assembly of the people, that it might receive from them a farther ratification, without which it could not be passed into a law,
nor have any force or obligatory power after the end of that year, which was the time that the senators and almost all other magistrates laid down their commissions. .
The power of this council was very great, almost the whole care of the commonwealth being devolved upon them ; for the commonalty being
by Solon's constitution invested with supreme power, and intrusted with the management of all affairs, as well public as private , it was the pecu
liar charge of the senate to keep them within due bounds, to take cogniz ance of every thing before it was referred to them , and to be careful that
nothing should be propounded to them , but what they, upon mature deli
beration , had found to be conducive to the public good. Besides the care of the assembly, there were a great many things that fell under the cog nizance of this court, as the accounts of magistrates at the expiration of
their offices, and the care of poor persons, that were maintained by an
allowance out of the public exchequer. It was their business to appoint jailors for the public prisons, and to examine and punish persons accused
of such crimes as were not forbidden by any positive law,5 to take care of the fleet, and look after the building of new men-of-war, with several other things of great consequence.
Now , because these were places of great trust, no man could be admit ted to them till he had undergone a strict doripadia, or probation, whereby
the whole course of his life was inquired into, and found to have been man
aged with credit and reputation , otherwise he was rejected ?
To lay the greater obligation upon them , they were required to take a solemn oath , the substance whereof was this: “ That they would , in all
their councils, endeavour to promote the public good, and not advise any thing contrary to the laws: that they would sit as judges in what court
soever they were elected to by lots (for several of the courts of justice were supplied with judges out of the senate) ; that they would never keep an Athenian in bonds who could give three sureties of the same quality , ex
cept such as had bought or collected or been engaged as a surety for the public revenues, and did not pay the commonwealth, and such as were
guilty of treasonable practices against the government . But this ( as Demosthenes interprets it) must be understood only of criminals before

their condemnation , for, to put them in fetters after sentence was passed
upon them , was no breach of the laws. But the highest punishment which the senate was allowed to inflict upon criminals was a fine of five hundred
drachmæ . When this was thought not enough , they transmitted the criminal to the thesmothetæ , by whom he was arraigned in the usual method . It must not be omitted, that, after the expulsion of the thirty
tyrants, they took an oath to observe the depinoríay, the act of oblivion ,
whereby all the disorders committed during the government of the tyrants were remitted .
After the expiration of their trust, the senators gave an account of their management; and therefore, to prevent their being exposed to the rage and malice of the multitude, they severely punished whatever offences were committed by any of their own members. If any of the senators was
convicted of breaking his oath, committing any injustice, or behaving him self otherwise than as became his order, the rest of his brethren expelled
him, and substituted one of the ' Artilagóryss in his place. This they called ixquadopogãous, from the leaves which they made use of in giving their suffrages, in the same manner that the "Ootpaxa were used by the
commonalty in decreeing the ostracism . But this custom was not very ancient, being introduced on account of one Xenotimus, an officer, who
by changing the beans (which till that time were always made use of),
was found to have corrupted the suffrages. It was lawful tous ixquido.
φορηθέντας εν τω δικαστηρίω καταδέχεσθαι, το αdmit those men to be judges who had been expelled out of the senate. Whence we may conclude, that
it was customary to deprive senators of their office for very small offences. On the contrary, such as had behaved themselves with justice and in
tegrity , were rewarded with an allowance of money out of the public ex chequer . Every senator received a drachm a day for his maintenance .
Whence Bouañs da xew , to be elected by lots into the senate, is all one, ac
cording to Hesychius' explication , with spa xoren ahs husgees haxsiy, to obtain a drachm every day. If any man -of -war had been built during the regency, the people, in their public assembly, decreed them the hon .
our of wearing a crown ; if not, the law prohibited them from suing for this privilege, as having been wanting to the commonwealth , whose safety
and interest depended upon nothing so much as the strength and number of their ships. This seems to have been enacted after the fight near
Salamis, that being the first occasion which moved the Athenians to think of increasing their fleet.

OF
THE

OF

The
name
of
this
sedate
was
taken
from
the
place
in
which
it
was
wont
to
be
assembled
,
being
a
hill
not
far
distant
from
the
citadel,1
called
'
Agsorázos
,
or
"

that
is

from
Mars
,
the
god

,
because
all
wilful
murders
can
under
the
cognizance
of
this
court
;
or
,
as
fables
tell
us
,
from
the
arraignment
of
Mars,
who
was
the
first
criminal
that
was
tried
in
it
;
'
or
,
lastly
,
because
the
Amazons
,
whom
the
poets
feign
to
have
been
the
daughters
of
Mars,
when
they
besieged
Athens,
pitched
their
camps
,
and
offered
sacrifices
to
the
god
of
war
,
in
this
place
.
When
this
court
was
first
instituted
is
uncertain
.
Some
make
it
as
ancient
as
Cecrops
,
the
first
founder
of
Athens
;
others
think
it
was
begun
in
the
reign
of
Cranaus
;
and
lastly
,
others
bring
it
down
as
low
as
the
times
of
Solon
.
But
this
opinion
,
though
defended
by
authors
of
no
less
credit
than
Plutarch
,
and
Cicero
,
is
in
express
terms
contradicted
by
Aristotle
,
and
one
of
Solon's
laws
cited
by
Plutarch
himself,
wherein
there
is
mention
of
judgments
made
in
this
court
before
Solon
had
reform
ed
the
commonwealth
.
What
seems
most
probable
is
,
that
the
senate
of
Areopagus
was
first
instituted
a
long
time
before
Solon
,
but
was
continued
,
regulated
,
and
augmented
by
him
;
was
by
him
made
superior
to
the
ephetæ
,
another
court
instituted
by
Draco
,
and
invested
with
greater
power
,
authority
,
and
larger
privileges
,
than
it
had
ever
enjoyed
before
.
The
number
of
the
persons
that
composed
this
venerable
assembly
is
not
agreed
upon
;
by
some
it
is
restricted
to
nine
,
by
others
enlarged
to
thirty
-one
,
by
others
to
fifty

one
,
and
by
some
to
more

Maximus

who
were
the

,

,
that
not
all
the
nine
archons
,
but
only
the

were
admitted
into
the

This
was
the
reason
why
their

,
but
more
or

as

Festus, proconsul of Greece, the senate of Areopagus is said to consist of three hundred ,
All who had undergone the office of an archon were not taken into this senate, but only such of them as had behaved themselves well in the dis
charge of their trust ; and not they neither, till they had given an account of their administration before the logistæ, and obtained their approbation ,
after an inquiry into their behaviour, which was not a mere formality, and thing of course, but extremely severe, rigorous, and particular .' This
being done after the performance of certain sacrifices at Limnæ, a place at Athens dedicated to Bacchus, they were admitted upon set days.2
Thus it was ordered by Solon's constitutions, which were nicely and punctually observed for many ages ; but towards the declination of the
Athenian grandeur, together with many other useful and excellent
ordinances, they were either wholly laid aside and abrogated, or , which was all one, neglected and not observed. Then not the archons only, but
others, as well those of loose lives and mean fortunes, as persons of high
quality and strict virtue, nay, and even foreigners, were taken into this assembly , as appears by several instances produced by the learned Meur
sius, and particularly that of Rufus Festus, mentioned in the aforesaid inscription as a member of it.
Aristides tells us, this court was των εν τοις “Ελλησι δικαστηρίων τιμιώ
TUTOY xaà ágiáratov, the most sacred and venerable tribunal in all Greece ; and if we consider the justice of their sentences and judicial determina tions, the unblameableness of their manners, their wise and prudent beha
viour, and their high quality and station in the commonwealth, it will easily appear that this character was not unreasonable or undeserved . To have been sitting in a tavern or public house was a sufficient reason to deny an archon's admission into it ;s and though their dignity was usually
continued to them as long as they lived, yet if any of the senators was
convicted of any immorality, he was without mercy or favour presently expelled . Nor was it enough that their lives were strictly innocent and unblameable, but something more was required of them ; their counte
nances, words, actions, and all their behaviour, must be composed , serious,
and grave, to a degree beyond what was expected from other, the most virtuous, men. To laugh in their assembly was an unpardonable act of
levity ;* and for any of them to write a comedy, was forbidden by a parti cular precept of the law.5
Nay, so great an awe and reverence did this solemn assembly strike into those who sat in it, that Isocrates 6 tells us, that in his days, when
they were somewhat degenerated from their primitive virtue, however otherwise men were irregular and exorbitant, yet once chosen into this senate, they presently ceased from their vicious inclinations, and chose rather

to conform to the laws and manners of their court , ή ταϊς αυτών κακίαις
fuepéves, than to continue in their loose and debauched course of life. So
exactly upright and impartial were their proceedings, that Demosthenes ? tells us, that to his time there had never been so much as one of their
determinations, that either plaintiff or defendant had any just reason to
complain of. This was so eminently remarkable in all parts of Greece, that even foreign states, when any controversies happened among them,
would voluntarily submit to their decision : Pausanias 2 reports in parti cular of the Messenians, that before their first wars with the Spartans, they were very desirous that their quarrel should be referred to the areo pagites, and both parties stand to their determination .
It is reported that this court was the first that sat upon life and death ;}
and in later ages, a great many capital causes came under its cognizance. Before it were brought all incendiaries, all such as deserted their country,
against whom they proceeded with no less severity than was used to those that were convicted of treason, both being punished with death ;" such also
as had lain in wait for any person's life, whether their wicked contrivances were successful or not ; for the very designing to murder a man, was
thought to deserve no less than capital punishment; others are of opinion , that such causes were tried at the tribunal of the palladium . However
that may be , it is certain , that all wounds given out of malice, all wilful murders, and particularly such as were effected by poison , came under the
cognizance of this court. Some say that there was no appeal from the areopagites to the people ; but others, amongst whom is Meursius, are of a contrary opinion , and assure us, that not only their determinations might be called in question , and, if need was, retracted by an assembly
of the people,” but that themselves too, if they exceeded the due bounds
of moderation in inflicting punishments, were liable to account for it to the logistæ . The same author tells us afterwards, that this court had power to cancel the sentence of an assembly, if the people had acquitted
any criminal that deserved punishment, and to rescue out of their hands such innocent persons as were by prejudice or misinformation condemned .
by them . Perhaps in both these opinions there is something of truth, if
you understand the former , of the Areopagus in its primitive state; and the latter, when its power was retrenched by Pericles.
Their power in the commonwealth was very great; for by Solon's con stitution , the inspection and custody of the laws were committed to them , 10.
the public fund was disposed of and managed according to their discretion, 11 the care of all young men in the city belonged to them , and it was their
business to appoint them tutors and governors, 12 and see that they were
educated suitably to their several qualities.13 Nor did they only super

intend the youth, but their power was extended to persons of all ages and
Such as lived disorderly, or were guilty of any impiety, or immorality, they punished according to the merit of their offences; and
such as were eminent for a virtuous course of life they had power to
reward . To this end they went about with the gynæconomi to all public meetings, such as marriages, and solemn sacrifices, which were usually concluded with a banquet, to see that all things were carried on with
decency and sobriety . Idleness was a crime that came more especially
under their cognizance, and, (which seems to have been an institution peculiar to Solon ,) they were obliged to inquire strictly after every man's course of life, and to examine by what means he maintained himself in the
station he was in , that so there might be no room for such as lived by unlaw
ful arts, by cheating and cozenage, or theft or rapine. Besides this, matters
of religion, blasphemy against the gods, contempt of the holy mysteries, and all sorts of impiety, the consecration also of new gods, erection of temples and altars, and introduction of new ceremonies into divine wor
ship, were referred to the judgment of this court ; therefore Plato, having
been instructed in the knowledge of one god in Egypt, was forced to dis semble or conceal his opinion , for fear of being called to an account for it by the areopagites ;9 and St Paul was arraigned before them , as a setter
forth of strange gods when he preached unto them Jesus, and ' Aveotaris, or the resurrection . These were the chief businesses that this senate was
employed about, for they seldom intermeddled in the management of public
affairs, except in cases of great and imminent danger, and in these the commonwealth usually had recourse to them, as the last and safest refuge ."

,
as
was
usual
among
other
courts
of
justice
,
Two
things
are
very
remarkable
in
their
judgments:
First
,
that
they
sat
in
the
open
air,
a
custom
practised
in
all
the
courts
of
justice
that
had
cognizance
of
murder
:
partly
,
because
it
was
unlawful
for
the
accuser
and
criminal
in
such
cases
to
be
under
the
same
roof
;
and
partly
,
that
the
judges
,
whose
persons
were
esteemed
sacred
,
might
contract
no
pollution
from
conversing
with
men
profane
and
unhallowed
,
for
such
they
were
accounted
that
had
been
guilty
of
so
black
and
heinous
a
crime
.
Secondly
,
they
heard
and
determined
all
causes
at
night
,
and
in
the
dark
,
to
the
end
that
having
neither
seen
the
plaintiff
nor
defendant
,
they
might
lie
under
no
temptation
of
being
biassed
or
influenced
by
either
of
them
.
10
Of
what
consequence
this
was
,
may
be

the protectress of Athens, when sentence was going to pass against her, so changed the minds of her judges, by uncovering her breasts, that she
was immediately acquitted .' Actions about murder were ushered into the Areopagus by the Baosasùs who was allowed to sit as a judge amongst them , laying aside his crown,
which was one of the ornaments of his office .? : The common method they proceeded in was this : -- the court being
met, and the people excluded , they divided themselves into several com mittees, each of which had their causes assigned to be heard and deter
mined by them severally, if the multitude of business was so great that the whole senate could not take cognizance' of it together. Both these designations were performed by lots, in order that every man coming irito the court before it was determined what causes would fall to his share, none of them might lie under any temptation of having his honesty cor rupted with bribes. 3
Before the trial began , the plaintiff and defendant took solemn oaths
upon the testicles of a goat, a ram , and a bull, the Espevaà Jeai, or Furies. The plaintiff, in a case of murder, swore that he was related to the deceased
person , ( for none but near relations, at the farthest a cousin, were permitted to prosecute the murderer,) and that the prisoner was the cause of his death . The prisoner swore that he was innocent of the crime laid to his
charge. Both of them confirmed their oaths with direful imprecations,
wishing, that if they swore falsely , themselves, their houses, and their whole families, might be utterly destroyed and extirpated by the divine
vengeance ;t which they looked upon to be so dreadful and certain, that
the law inflicted no penalty upon those that at such a time were guilty of perjury, remitting them , as it were, to be punished by a higher tribunal, Then the two parties were placed upon two silver stools; the accuser
was placed upon the stool of " reges, or injury ; the prisoner upon the stool of 'Avadsia , or impudence ; or, according to Adrian Junius's correction of
'Ayurtia , innocence; these were two goddesses, to whom altars, and after
wards temples, were erected in the Areopagus . The accuser, in this place proposed three questions to the prisoner, called by Æschylus, ogía Funcionara , to each of which he was to give a distinct answer . The
first was, si xatéxtovus ; Are you guilty of this murder ? To which he
made answer, " Extova , or Oix črtova, Guilty , or Not guilty ; Secondly ,
OFWs ratéxtovus ; How did you commit this murder ? Thirdly, Tivos Bovasúpaoi natirtovas ; Who were your partners and accomplices in the fact ?
In the next place, the two parties impleaded each other, and the prisoner was allowed to make his defence in two orations, the first of which
being ended, he was permitted to secure himself by flight, and go into

voluntary banishment, if he suspected the goodness of his cause ; which privilege if he made use of, all his estate was confiscated, and exposed to sale by the Πωληται..' In the primitive times, both parties spoke for
themselves , but in later ages they were permitted to have counsel to plead for them . But whoever it was that spoke, he was to represent the bare and naked truth, without any preface or epilogue, without any ornament,
figures of rhetoric, or other insinuating means to win the favour or move the affections of the judges.
Both parties being heard , if the prisoner was resolved to stand trial,
they proceeded to give sentence, which they did with the most profound
gravity and silence ; hence 'Αρεοπαγίτου σιωπηλότερος, and 'Αρεοπαγίτου Orsydvéstipos, came to be proverbial sayings, though some derive them from the reservedness and severe gravity of their manners : hence also
Apronarians is usually taken for a grave, majestic, rigid person ; and others, from the great care they took to conceal the transactions of the senate .
The manner of giving sentence was thus ; There were placed in the
court two urns, one of which was of brass, and called é fungoolex, from the place it stood in ; zúgios, because the votes cast into it pronounced the accusation valid ; and Jarátov, because they decreed the death of the
prisoner. The second urn was of wood, being placed behind the former; into it they that acquitted the prisoner were to cast their 'suffrages ; for
which reason it was called ó Vorsgoś, or ó óriow , ó áxugos, and ó irov . Afterwards the thirty tyrants having made themselves masters of the city , ordered them to give their voices in a manner more public and open , by
casting their calculi upon two tables, the former of which contained the suffrages which acquitted , the latter those which condemned the prisoner ; in order that it might be known which way every man gave his voice, and how he stood affected to their interest and proceedings.
Besides the crimes that came peculiarly under their cognizance , there were sometimes others brought before them, in which their sentence was
not finalor decretory , for there lay an appeal to the court to which they properly belonged, as Sigonius observes.
The senators of Areopagus were never rewarded with crowns for their services, being not permitted to wear them ; but received a sort of main
tenance from the public, which they called Kpéas ;8 and Meursius has observed out of Lucian, that they had the same pension which was allotted to some other judges, that is, three oboli for every cause they gave judg
ment
upon
.
Their authority was preserved entire till the time of Pericles, who, because he could not be admitted amongst them , as never having borne

the office of an archon, employed all his power and cunning against them ; and having gained a great interest with the commonalty, so embroiled and
routed their senate by the assistance of Ephialtes, that most of the causes and matters which had been formerly tried there, were discharged from their cognizance. From this time, the Atheniaus being, in a great measure, freed from the restraint that had been laid upon them, began sensibly to degenerate from their ancient virtue, and in a short time let
loose the reins of all manner of licentiousness ; whence they are compared
by Plutarch to a wild unruly horse, that having flung his rider, would be governed and kept in no longer. The same vices and excesses that were
practised in the city, crept in by degrees amongst the areopagites them selves: and therefore Demetrius, one of the family of the Phalerean ,
being censured by them as a loose liver, told them plainly , that if they designed to make a reformation in the city , they must begin at home, for that even amongst them there were several persons of as bad and worse lives than himself, and (which was a more unpardonable crime than any that he had been guilty of) several, that debauched and corrupted other
men's wives, and were themselves corrupted and seduced by bribes.

The judges were chosen out of the citizens, without distinction of quality, the very meanest being by Solon admitted to give their voices in the popular assembly, and to determine causes, provided they were arrived at the age of thirty years, and had never been convicted of any notorious crime.
The courts of justice were ten, besides that in Areopagus. Four had
cognizance επί των φονικών πραγμάτων , of actions concerning Blood ; the remaining six , iti rāv eneorizūv, of civil matters. These ten courts were
all painted with colours, from which names were given them , whenc read of Βατραχιούν, Φοινικιούν, and others . And on each of them was

their names, together with the names of their father and borough, inscribed upon a tablet, to the thesmothetæ ; who returned it to them with another
tablet, whereon was inscribed the letter of one of the courts, as the lots
had directed. These tablets they carried to the crier of the several courts, signified by the letters, who thereupon gave to every man a tablet inscribed with his own name, and the name of the court which fell to his lot, and a staff or sceptre. Having received these, they were all admitted to sit in
the court. If any person sat among the judges, who had not obtained one
of the forementioned letters, he was fined .? The Athenian judges having heard the causes they were appointed to take cognizance of, went immediately and delivered back the sceptre to the prytanes, from whom they received the reward due to them . This
was termed δικαστικών , or μισθός δικαστικός. Sometimes it was an obolus for every cause they decided ; sometimes three oboli, being sometimes
raised higher than at others, by the instance of men , who endeavoured by
that means to become popular . No man was permitted to sit as judge in two courts upon the same day, that looking like the effect of covetousness. And if any of the judges was convicted of bribery, he was fined . ' Επί Παλλαδίω, was a court of judicature instituted in the reign of
Demophoon , the son of Theseus, upon this account: some of the Argives,
under the conduct of Diomedes, or, as others say , of Agamemnon , being driven in the night upon the coasts of Attica, landed at the haven of Pha
lerus, and supposing it to be an enemy's country, went out to spoil and plun der it. The Athenians presently took the alarm , and having united them
selves into one body under the conduct of Demophoon, repulsed the invaders, with great loss, killing a great many of them upon the spot, and forcing
the rest to retire into their ships ; but upon the approach of day, Acamus, the brother of Demophoon , finding amongst the dead bodies the palladium , or statue of Minerva, brought from Troy, discovered that the persons they
had killed were their friends and allies ; whereupon , having first advised with an oracle , they gave them an honourable burial in the place where they
were slain, consecrated the goddess' statue, erected a temple to her, and
instituted a court of justice, in which coğoizance was taken of such as were indicted for involuntary murders. The first that was arraigned in it was Demophoon , who, in his return from the forementioned conflict, killed one of his own subjects by a sudden turn of his horse . Others report, that Agamemnon being enraged at the loss of his and dis
satisfied at Demophoon's rash and hasty attack upon them, referred the

quarrel to the decision of fifty Athenians, and as many Argians, whom
they called 'Εφέται, διά το παρ' αμφοτέρων έφεθήναι αυτούς τα της κρίσεως,
because both parties committed the determination of their cause to them . Afterwards the Argians were excluded, and the number of the ephetæ reduced to fifty - one, by Draco, whom some affirm to have been the first
institutor of them ; but others, with more probability, report that he regu
lated and reformed them , augmented their power, honoured them with many important privileges, and made them superior to the senate of Areopagus. In this state they continued till Solon's time, by whom their
power was lessened , and their authority restrained ; the causes which had
formerly been tried by them were discharged from their cognizance, and only those about manslaughter and chauce-medley, and, as some say,
conspiracies against the lives of citizens, that were discovered before they took effect, left to them .
Fifty of them were appointed for election , five being chosen out of every tribe, but the odd man was appointed by lots ; all of them were men of good characters and virtuous lives, of severe manners, and a settled gra
vity ; and no person under the age of fifty years was admitted into their number.
Causes were entered in this court by the Baordiùs, and the proceedings were in some things agreeable to those of the Areopagus ; for both parties, the plaintiff and defendant, were obliged to confirm their allegations by solemn oaths and curses, and then the orators having performed their parts, the judges proceeded to give sentence.
'Eri AraPiriw, was a court of justice in the temple of Apollo Delphinius and Diana Delphinia. Under its cognizance came all murders wherein
the prisoner confessed the fact, but pleaded that it was committed by per mission of the laws, as in the case of self-preservation or adultery ; for it was allowed any one to kill an adulterer, if he caught him in the act.2
The first person that was tried in this court was Theseus, who, on his journey to Athens had slain the robbers that infested the ways between Troezen and that place ; and afterwards the sons of Pallas, who raised a rebellion against him .
'Evi ligutavsiw, was a court of judicature, which had cognizance of murders committed by things without life, or sense, as stones, iron, tim ber, &c. which, if they killed a man by accident, or by the direction of an unknown hand , or of a person that had escaped, had judgment passed upon them in this place, and were ordered to be cast out of the territories
of Athens by the Durobacia eīs. This court was as ancient as Erechtheus:
and the first thing that was brought to trial in it was an axe , wherewith one of Jupiter's priests killed an ox , ( an animal accounted very sacred in
those days ,) that had eaten one of the consecrated cakes, and as soon as he had committed the fact, secured himself by flight . This place also was

the common -hall, in which public entertainments were made ; and the
sacred lamp, that burned with a perpetual fire, was kept by widows, who having passed the years and desires of marriage, were devoted to the
Mother of the gods; which lamp, as Plutarch , in the life of Numa, tells
us, was extinct under the tyranny of Aristion ; it was always managed with the same rites and ceremonies that were used at Rome, about the
vestal fires, which he saith were ordained and instituted after the pattern
of this and another holy fire of the same nature amongst the Delphians. ’E, øgsartół

CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. 119

Teigwvov was, in all probability, so called because it was triangular.? Tò ità Aúrov, received its name from the temple of the hero Lycus, in which it was erected . The same person had a statue in all the courts of justice, by which he was represented with a wolf's face, and therefore
Λύκου δεκά; signifies sycophants , and τους δωροδοκούντας, those who took bribes, who, by tens, that is, in great numbers, frequented those places.2
Tò Mnrixou, was so called from one Metichus, an architect, by whom it was built.3
The judges in all these courts were obliged to take a solemn oath , by the paternal Apollo, Ceres, and Jupiter the king, that they would give sentence uprightly, and according to law ; if the law had determined the point debated : or , when the law was silent, according to the best of their
judgment. Which oath , as also that which was taken by those that judged in the Heliæa, was given in a place near the river Ilissus, called Ardet tus, from a hero of that name, who, in a public sedition, united the con
testing parties, and engaged them to confirm their treaties of peace by mutual oaths in this place. Hence common and profane swearers came to be called "Αρδηττοι.4
Of all the judicial courts that handled civil affairs, 'Hraire was far the
greatest and most frequented , being so called årò Tom risolo , from the people's thronging together," or rather από του ηλίου, because it was an open place, and exposed to the sun ..
The judges that sat in this court were at least fifty, but the more usual number was two or five hundred. When causes of great consequence
were to be tried , it was customary to call in the judges of other courts . Sometimes a thousand were called in, and then two courts were said to
havebeen joined ; sometimes fifteen hundred or two thousand, and then three or four courts met together. Whence it appears that the judges were sometimes five hundred in other courts.
They had cognizance of civil affairs of the greatest weight and impor tance, and were not permitted to give judgment till they had taken a solemn oath , the form whereof was this, as we find it in Demosthenes : 8
“ I will give sentence according to the laws, and the decrees of the people of Athens, and the council of five hundred . I will not consent to place
the supreme power in the hands of a single person or a few ; nor permit any man to dissolve the commonwealth, or so much as to give his vote, or make an oration in defence of such a revolution . I will not endeavour to
discharge private debts, nor to make any division of lands or houses. I
will not restore persons sent into banishment, nor pardon those that are condemned to die, nor expel any man out of the city contrary to the laws
and decrees of the people, and council of five hundred , nor permit any

other person to do it. I will not elect any person into any public employ, and particularly , I will not create any man archon , hieromnemon , ambas sador, public herald , or synedrus, nor consent that he shall be admitted
into any of those offices, which are elected by lots upon the same day with the archons, who has undergone any former office and not given in his accounts ; nor that any persons shall bear two offices , or be twice elect
ed into the same office in one year. I will not receive gifts myself, nor shall any other for me ; nor will I permit any other person to do the like by any means, whether direct or indirect, to pervert justice in the court of
Heliæa. I am not under thirty years of age. I will hear both the plain tiff and defendant without partiality, and give sentence in all the causes brought before me. I swear by Jupiter, Neptune, and Ceres: if I
violate this oath, or any part of it, may I perish with my whole family ; but if I religiously observe it, may we live and prosper.' These were the ten public courts in Athens. There were others of less
note, where particular magistrates, as the Auritntai, or the Tropagázott , took cognizance of causes belonging to the several offices ; such was the
court at Cynosarges, Odeum, Theseus' temple, Bucoleum, and some others. The method of judicial process was this : first of all, the plaintiff deliv
ered in the name of the person against whom he brought his action , to
gether with an account of his offence, to the magistrate, whose concern it was ( siotéyev) to introduce it into the court where causes of that nature
were heard. The magistrate then examined whether the cause was one
of those which belonged to his cognizance, and then si rws siráyu xeń ; whether it deserved to be tried in a court of justice ? This inquiry was
termed svengiais. Then by the magistrate's permission , the plaintifi summoned his adversary to appear before the magistrate, which was termed xanteceu. This was sometimes done by apparitors or bailifis,
whom they called rastoges, or ranoñgss ; sometimes by the plaintiff him self, who always carried with him sufficient witnesses to attest the giving of the summons ; and these were also termed xantopes, or xantñgss.3 An
example of this method we find in the Vespæ of Aristophanes :* Προσκαλούμαι σ', όστις εί , Προς τους 'Αγορανόμους , βλάβης των φορτίων Κλητήρ’ έχουσα Χαιρεφώντα τουτονί,
I summon thee, whoever thou art, to answer before the agoranomi for the
damage done to my goods: this Chærephon is witness. This, therefore, was the form in which the plaintiff' himself summoned his adversary:
Προσκαλούμαι τον δείνα τούδε αδικήματος προς την Αρχήν τήνγε κλητήρα xwe tòy dzīvce. I summon such a person to answer for this injury before this magistrate, having such a one for my witness.5 When the plaintiff
employed an apparitor, the form was thus varied : Katnyopão tòx dsīva
τούδε, και προσκαλούμαι τούτον δια του δείνος εις την 'Αρχήν τήνγε :

cuse such a person of this injury, and summon him by such un one to
answer before this niagistrate. For it was necessary to mention the name of the ranting in the summons. Lastly, when a married woman was cited to appear before a magistrate, her husband was also summoned , in
this form : Thy decyce xai còn xúgiore Such a woman and her lord , &c., because wives being under the government of their husbands, were not permitted to appear in any court without them . If the criminal refused
to appear before the magistrate , he was carried thither by force .'
Sometimes the criminal was not summoned to appear immediately, but upon a certain day, which was always mentioned in the form of his citation . Καλούμαι Πεισθέταιρον ύβρεως Εις τον Μουνυχιώνα μήνα,
I summon Pisthetærus to answer the next month of Munychion for the injury done me . When the plaintiff and defendant were both come before the magistrate, he inquired of the plaintiff, whether all his evidence was ready, or whether he needed any other witness to be summoned ? This
was the second ávírgiois, to which the plaintiff'was obliged to offer himself
under the penalty of arouía , infamy. If any of his witnesses were not ready, or any other necessaries were wanting, he desired farther time to
make his prosecution, swearing that this delay was not on his part voluntary ; to do which was termed vrópwofes, and the thing itself it wylogia , The same excuse was likewise admitted in behalf of the defendant, who had
also another plea , termed sugargaqin, or tagapagtugíu , when he alleged, by sufficient witnesses, that the action brought against him was not din
giocyógicos, a cause which could then lawfully be tried ; which happened on several accounts : - When the injury had been committed five years before the accusation ; for that time being expired , the laws permitted no
action to be preferred. When the controversy had been formerly com posed before credible witnesses ; for any voluntary agreement before wit
nesses was valid, provided it was not about things unlawful. When the
defendant had been formerly either punished for or legally tried and acquitted of the fact. Lastly, it was a just exception that the cause was
not one of those whereof that magistrate was empowered to take cogniz ance . To this tugayqapin the plaintiff was obliged to give his answer,
proved by sufficient evidence ; and both the exception and the answer together, as sworn by the witnesses, were termed drapeapTugía . But if the defendant, without alleging any plea or excuse, was willing to proceed
to a speedy trial, he was said súdudizsīv, and the trial was termed suludoxice. Then an oath was required of both parties. The plaintiff swore that he
would aanbñ xatnyagtã, prefer no accusation that was untrue; and, if
the crime was of a public nature, he farther swore , that he would not be prevailed on , either by bribes or promises, or any other temptation, to

desist from the prosecution. The defendant swore , uantñ úrokorhour, that his answer should be just and true ; or, un adıxsã, that he had not
injured the plaintiff. The plaintiff's oath was termed rowposic, the defendant's artwocíc , and, as some think, urtigpoon ; and both together d.wproía . These oaths, together with those of the witnesses, and all other matters relating to the action, being written upon tablets, were put into a vessel, termed igivos, and afterwards delivered to the judges.? This being done, the magistrate proceeded to the election of judges,
which was performed by lots ; and they, upon the rugía nuégue, or appointed day, came to the tribunal, and took their places, the public crier having
before commanded all those that had no business, to depart, in those words, Météotat: [ w . Then , to keep the crowds from thronging in upon
them, the court was surrounded with a rope, by the command of a magis trate, and serjeants appointed to keep the doors, which they called Kiya Kuides , being the same with those which the Romans called Cancellatæ . Now, lest any of the judges should be wanting, proclamation was made in
this manner : Εί τις θύραισιν Hλιαστής , εισίτω: If any judge be without the doors, let him enter ; for, if any man came after the cause began to be
discussed, he could not have admission, as not being capable of giving sentence, because he had not heard all that both parties could say for them selves .
Then the magistrate proposed the cause to the judges, and gave them
power to determine it, the doing which they called εισάγειν την δίκην εις το δικαστήριον, the cause itself δίκη εισαγώγιμος, and the person that entered it Eidaywyzós. For, by the laws of Athens, there were certain causes brought before several of the magistrates who had no power to determine them by a final decision, but were only to examine into the matter , and, if it deserved to be heard in the court, refer it to the cognizance of judges
appointed for that purpose, upon a day fixed by himself; and this is what they called ηγεμονία δικαστρίων.. Then the indictment was read by the public crier, in which were con tained the reasons of the accusation , with an account of the injury said to
be received , the manner also of it, and the damage suffered by the plain tiff; the heads of which the judges took in writing .'
If the person accused did not make his appearance, sentence was given
against him, without any farther trouble ; and this they called it égágens xuradixeabñve and iphu nu opasoráveis. But if, in the space of ten days, he came and presented himself, proving that he had been detained by sickness, or any other extraordinary and unavoidable necessity, the former
sentence was disannulled ; and therefore this proceeding they called dixn pene oor Then the trial was to be brought on afresh , within the space of two months, by the defendant, and this they called értíangis, and the do

ing it évtiheysiy dixno; but, if he neglected to have the cause decided in
that time, the former sentence was to stand good , and be put in execution
upon him . Hence appears the reason for which they were always obliged to insert the name of the person who was witness to the citation of the
criminal. But if any man falsely pretended that his adversary was legally
cited , and could not produce any xiútoges, who were present at the cita tion, he was prosecuted by an action termed ypapi sudoxanasias . Before the trial began, both parties were obliged to deposit a certain sum of money, which they called argutavsia , into the hands of the magis trate that entered their cause into the court, who, upon failure of the pay
ment, immediately expunged the cause out of the roll. If the cause in
debate was concerning the value of a hundred drachms, or upwards, to a thousand, they deposited three drachms ; if its value was more than a
thousand, and not above ten thousand, they deposited thirty, which, after the decision of the cause, were divided among the judges; and the person
that was cast, was obliged , besides the payment of other charges, to restore the money to his adversary .
Παρακαταβολή, was a sum of money deposited by those that sued the commonwealth for confiscated goods, or any others that were claimed by the public exchequer, or by private persons for the inheritances of heiresses ;
the former deposited the fifth, the latter the tenth part of the estates con tended for.4
Tlapkotaois, was a drachm deposited in lawsuits about small and private matters, which were decided by the Additntai."
'Exwbéas , was a fine laid upon those that could not prove the indict ment they had brought against their adversaries ; so called, because they
were obliged to pay the sixth part of the value of the thing they contended for, from ófonos, because out of every drachm they deposited one obolus, which is the sixth part of a drachm . Some of these sums were deposited
in all lawsuits, a very few excepted, before the trial could proceed.
Then the witnesses were produced , and if any of them refused to make his appearance, he was summoned by a serjeant, whom they called rantie, and if he seemed unwilling to be an evidence, had three things proposed
to him , namely, to swear the fact ; to abjure it, or deny that he was privy to it ; or, lastly, to pay a mulct of a thousand drachms. He that was fined
for refusing the oath, or that took it out of fear, was said xxantsúsolar; he that was only summoned, and took it voluntarily, xantsúcobase? The oath was taken at the altar, with all the solemnity imaginable, to which end they erected altars in all the courts of judicature.

Tipso, infimous, were not thought to deserve belief: the slaves were not permitted to have any concern in public business, and therefore could not
be evidences, except they were examined upon the rack, nor plead in any court of justice. Nevertheless, the testimony of the fitoixa and etiacú Bigoi, sojourners and freedmen , seems to have been received in all cases ,
except the διαμαρτυρία , in the actions called απροστασίου δίκαι, as the gram marians inform us from Hyperides.
There were two sorts of evidences : the first of which they called fungo Tupíce, when the person that swore was an eyewitness of the fact ; the other, impiaprugic , when the juror received what he testified from another person that had been an eyewitness of it, but was at this time either dead or in a foreign country, or detained by sickness, or hindered by some other
unavoidable accident from making his appearance ; for, except in such cases, the allegations of absent persons were never taken for lawful evi,
dence. The witnesses were required by the laws to deliver their testi,
mony in writing ; whereby it became impossible to recede from what they had once sworn , and such as had borne false witness were convicted with
less difficulty. But the tablets of those witnesses, who, upon a citation
before given , came from home with an intention to give their testimonies, were different from the tablets of such as casually came into the court ;
the latter being only composed of wax , and ordered in such a manner, as gave the witness opportunity to make such alterations in the matter of his evidence , as afterwards, upon better consideration , appeared to be ne cessary .3 When the witnesses were sworn, the plaintiff being placed upon the
left hand of the tribunal, and the defendant upon the right,4 both of them spoke set orations in their own behalf. These were, for the most part , composed by some of the orators, which custom was first introduced by Antiphon, a Rhamnusian . Sometimes, if they desired it, the judges granted them Xuyugopos, or advocates, to plead for them , the doing which
they called tri puolñ ournyogeix, to pleadfor a fee. In case, by the length of their orations, they should weary the judges' patience, and hinder them
from proceeding to other business, they were limited to a certain time,
called διαμεμετρημένη ημέρα,7 which was measured by a κλεψυδρα , or hour glass, differing from ours in this, that instead of sand, they made use of
water; and to prevent all fraud and deceit, there was an officer appointed to distribute the water equally to both sides, whom, from his business, they
called ' EQúdwe, or 'EQ' idwe. When the glass was run out, they were permitted to speak no farther, and therefore we find them very careful not to lose or mispend one drop of their water : and whilst the laws quoted by
them were reciting, or if any other business happened to intervene, they gave order that the glass should be stopped . Yet if any person had made

an end of speaking before the time allotted him was expired, he was per mitted to resign the remaining part of the water to any other that had
occasion : and this is meant by the orator, when he saith rõ üdati tã šuã hansitw, let him speak till what remains of my water be run out.
When both parties had made an end of speaking, the public crier, by
the command of the magistrate that presided in the court, ordered the judges to bring in their verdict ; and in such cases, as the laws had made
provision , and appointed penalties for (which were called árūves ériuntai ), a single verdict, whereby the person was declared guilty , or not guilty,
was sufficient; but in those cases that the laws were silent in (which they called éywyss tiuntoi ), a second sentence was required, if the accused per son was brought in guilty, to determine what punishment was due to his offence, Before they proceeded to give sentence, the condemned person
was asked what damage he thought his adversary had received from him ,
and what recompence he ought in justice to make him ? The plaintiff's account, together with the indictment he had delivered in before, was taken into consideration ; and then the circumstances on both sides
being duly weighed, the decretory sentence was given . Sometimes the judges limited the punishment in criminal, as well as civil causes, where
the laws were silent. This happened in the case of Socrates, “ who,' to
apply the words of Cicero,2 was not only condemned by the first sentence of the judges, which determined whether the criminal should be condemned or acquitted , but by that also which the laws obliged them to pronounce
afterwards. For at Athens, when the crime was not capital, the judges were empowered to value the offence ; and it was inquired of the criminal, to what value he thought his offence' amounted ? Which question being
proposed to Socrates, he replied, That he had merited very great honours and rewards, and to have a daily maintenance in the Prytaneum ; which the Grecians accounted one of the highest honours. By which answer the
judges were incensed to such a degree, that they condemned that most innocent man to death."
The most ancient way of giving sentence was by black and white sea.
shells, called Engivas ; or pebbles, called fñpon. After them , orárdużon,
which were pellets of brass, came into use ; which, when laid aside, rúcuoi, or beans, succeeded . They were of two sorts, white and black : the white were whole, and were made use of to absolve ; the black were bored through, and were the instruments of condemnation . Hence it is, that
in Aristophanes ,5 judges that lived upon the gifts they received for doing justice, are called xuapotpūres, bean -eaters, and asunn fãpos , is a proverb not much different from all ougavice, or Analthea capra , being usually ap
plied to things that bring in large gains, and are a maintenance to their masters,6

GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES,
These beans the judges took from the altar; and two urns, which they called vádor, or radioxo, being placed , they cast in their beans through a
little tunnel, called xnycos, holding them only with three fingers, namely , the forefinger, middle, and thumb, that it might be impossible for them to
cast in above one at a time. The rest of their customary rites are some what the same with those I have already described in the judgments of the court of Areopagus, except that in private causes there were four urns placed in the court, as Sigonius has observed out of Demosthenes. But
this, perhaps, was occasioned by the number of the persons concerned in
the trial; for if there were more than two competitors that laid claim to an estate, each of them had a distinct urn , into which those that passed
sentence on his side were to cast their beans, and he that had the greatest
number obtained the victory, which Sigonius seems not to have observed . When all had given over voting, lest any man out of favour should sus
pend his suffrage, the crier made proclamation in this manner, E ! Tis αψήφιστος , ανιστάσθω If there be any that has not given his voice, let
him now arise and give it. Then the urns were opened, and the suf
frages numbered in presence of the magistrate, who stood with a rod in
his hand, which he laid over the beans as they were numbered, lest any person should , through treachery or mistake, omit any of them , or count
the same twice. If the number of the black beans was greatest, he pro nounced the person guilty, and as a mark to denote his condemnation ,
drew a long line, whence draci Topeậy jargàr, in the comedian, signifies to condemn all : on the contrary , he drew a short line, in token of absolu tion , if the white beans exceeded, or only equalled the number of the
black ;a for such was the clemency of the Athenian laws, that when the
case seemed equally disputable on both sides, the severe and rigorous com mands of justice gave place to the milder laws of mercy and compassion ;
and this rule seems to have been constantly observed in all the courts of Athens. *Iσαι δέ σ' εκσώζουσι μή θανείν δίκη Absolv'd , the equal number of the shells POTTER , The plaintiff was called Aiúxwv; the whole suit Aíwğıs; and the de fendant piúyw. The indictment before conviction was named Airic ;
after conviction , " Easyxos ; and after condemnation , ' Adixapece. All the time the cause was in suspense and undetermined, it was exposed to
public view , being engraved on a tablet, together with the name of the person accused , and hung up at the statue of the heroes, surnamed 'Erørupos, than which there was not a more public place in the whole city ; this they called {xxtñolas, and it seems to have been done with a design that all persons who could give any information to the court, having sufficient notice of the trial, should come and present themselves.

into the hands of the “ Exdsxc , to receive the punishment due to his offence ; but if a pecuniary mulct was laid upon him, the Tæpíces Toû Otoll took care to see it paid ; and in case his estate was not able to make pay
ment, they confined him to perpetual imprisonment." If, on the contrary, the plaintiff had accused his adversary unjustly, and produced false evi
dence against him , he was in some places obliged to undergo the punish , ment due by law to the crime, of which he had falsely accused an innocent person ; but at Athens had only a fine laid upon him . Both the villain
that had forsworn himself, and he that suborned him, were severely prose
cuted ; the former by an action of Ψευδομαρτυρία , the latter of Κακοτεχνία. Of these, and the punishment due to such offenders, I shall speak farther in another place.
When the trials were over, the judges went to Lycus' temple, where they returned their ' Péßdos, staves or sceptres, which were ensigns of their
office, and received from certain officers called Kwaxgétas , a piece of money for their service, which at the first was only one obolus; after, wards it was increased to two, then to three , and at length to a drachm , which was six oboli, as we have before observed from the scholiast upon Aristophanes. Though these rewards may seem trifling and inconsider able expenses, yet the troublesome temper of the Athenians, and their
nice exaction of every little duty or privilege, occasioned so great a number of lawsuits, that the frequent payment of these small sums by degrees so exhausted the exchequer, that they became a burden to the common wealth , and are particularly reflected upon by Aristophanes, who takes occasion everywhere to ridicule this litigious humour, which was then
grown to such a height, that every corner of the streets was pestered with swarms of turbulent rascals, who made it their business to pick up stories,
and catch at every occasion to accuse persons of credit and reputation ; these they called Evxopárra , which word sometimes signifies false wit nesses , but is more properly taken for what we call common barretors, being derived årò Toù Tà cũxa paívov, from indicting rsons that exported figs; for amongst the primitive Athenians, when the use of that fruit was first found out, or in the time of a dearth , when all sorts of provisions were exceedingly scarce, it was enacted , that no figs should be ex ,
ported out of Attica ; and this law not being actually repealed , when a plentiful harvest had rendered it useless, by taking away its reason , gave occasion to ill-natured and malicious men, to accuse all persons whom they
caught transgressing the letter of it ; and from them all busy informers have ever since been branded with the name of sycophants. Others will
have the stealing of figs to have been prohibited by a particular law , and that thence informations grew so numerous, that all vexatious informers were afterwards termed sycophants.

OF THE ΤΕΣΣΑΡΑΚΟΝΤΑ AND ΔΙΑΙΤΗΤΑΙ ..
ΟΙ Τεσσαράκοντα , were forty men that went their circuits round the several
boroughs, and had cognizance of all controversies about money, when the sum exceeded not ten drachms: also, as Demosthenes reports, had actions of assault and battery brought to their hearing. Pollux tells us, that at their first institution, they were no more than thirty in number ; but Hesychius reports, the magistrates or judges called oi Tesáxovta , were
those that amerced the people for absenting themselves from the public assemblies.
Avastatai, or arbitrators, were of two sorts :
1. Kangwroi were forty -four men in each tribe above the age of sixty, as Pollux, or fifty, as Suidas reports, drawn by lots, to determine contro
versies in their own tribe about money, when the sum was above ten drachms. Their sentence was not final; so that if either of the contesting
parties thought himself injured by it, he might appeal to the superior courts of justice . At their first institution , all causes whatsoever that
'exceeded ten drachms were heard by them , before they could be received
into the other courts. They passed sentence without obliging themselves by any oath , but in other things acted in the same manner with the rest
of the judges; they received a drachm of the plaintiff, which was called TagéoTaois, or decoraois, and another of the defendant, when they admin
istered the oath to him, which was termed avtwuovia . If the parties did
not appear at the appointed time and place, they staid expecting till the evening, and then determined the cause in favour of the party there pre sent. Their office continued a whole year, at the end of which they gave
up their accounts ; and if they were proved to have refused to give judg
ment, or to have been corrupted, they were punished with étipic , infamy. Under them were certain officers called Eidaywysis, whose
business it was εισάγειν τας δίκας, to receive the complaints that fell under the cognizance of the Asacitntai, and enter them into their court ." 2. Διαλλακτήριοι, Or κατ ' επιτροπής Διαιτηταί, or compromissaris, were
such as two parties chose to determine any controversy betwixt them ; and these the law permitted any person to request, but obliged him to stand to whatever they determined , without any farther appeal ; and therefore,
as a greater obligation to justice, they took an oath that they would give sentence without partiality.o

OF THE PUBLIC JUDGMENTS, ACTIONS, &c.
THE Athenian judgments were of two sorts, Impotinai and idewTirci, public and private : the former were about such crimes as tended to the prejudice of the state , and these actions were called xarnyogías; the latter compre hended all controversies that happened between private persons, and were
called dinas . Nor did they only differ as to their matter, but in their process and management, and particularly in this, that in private actions
no man could prosecute the offender, besides the party injured , or some of
his near relations ; whereas in the public, the laws encouraged all the citizens to revenge the public wrong, by bringing the criminal to condign punishment.2 The public judgments were these:
1. Tapi was an action laid upon such as had been guilty of any of the following crimes : póros , murder.
Τραύμα εκ προνοίας , a wound given out of malice .
Iluqxcià , firing the city .. Páguaxor, poison . Botasvois, a conspiracy against any person's life ; or the crime of the
city -treasurers who entered into the public debt-book persons not indebted to the city :- wherein it differs from fevdsyrgaon, whereby the treasurers charged men with debts which were already discharged .” ' Ispoovaia, sacrilege. 'Aréßuic , impiety.
Ipodovic, treason . ‘Eraignois, fornication .
Magría , whoredom ; this was punished with a mulct. 'Ayó usor, celibacy, ’Asagatelu , refusing to serve in the wars. They who were convicted of this crime were punished with åripía, infamy .
Aurortpários, desertion of the army. This drew only a fine on the criminal."
Asukorážov, a desertion of a man's station , as when any person refused
to serve on foot, and enlisted himself among the horsemen , which by Solon's laws was esteemed as great a crime as a total desertion of the army.

Tò pífantno korido, losing a man's shield. This was likewise punished with infamy.
Ψευδεγγραφή, ψευδογραφή, or ψευδής εγγραφή, was the crime of those that falsely charged others, and sued them for public debts, which Harpo cration calls feudorantsíc but this seems rather to have been an action
for false arrests, according to Pollux. The punishment was only a mulct . Luxopartía, barretry, or frivolous accusation . This was punished also
with a mulct. It differed from sudoveapruzíc , or false witness, the third act whereof was punished with atopía , infamy.
Aõpre or dwodoxia, taking bribes to manage any public affair, or pervert justice; it was not thought enough to punish the receiver, but the person also that offered bribes was prosecuted, and the action against him called dexnouós. The same action in causes about the freedom of the city, was,
by a peculiar name, termed dangutevia. All who had been guilty of receiv ing bribes were fined in ten times the value of what they had gained , and punished with the highest degree of dripía, infamy. But if the accuser
could not prevail with a fifth part of the judges to credit his information, he was fined a thousand drachmæ , and underwent the lowest degree of
åtiuía , infamy.
" TBgis, beating a freeman , or binding him as they used to do to slaves. 'Ayećépoor, erasing a name out of the public debt -book before the debt was discharged
' Aygápov péraklov, digging a mine without acquainting the public officers; for before any person could dig a mine, he was obliged to inform certain officers, appointed by the people , of his design , to the end that the twenty -fourth part of the metal might be reserved for the public use. 'Albyrov was against magistrates that had neglected to give up their accounts .
Ilagavóuw you on , against such as, in proposing a new law , acted con trary to the old and established laws.
Eibúvn was against magistrates, ambassadors, or other officers that had
misemployed the public money , or committed any other offence in the discharge of their several trusts . That against ambassadors was some times, by a peculiar name, called παραπρεσβεία ..

'Atorygap was when any person , being sued for debts said to be due to the public, pleaded that they were falsely charged upon him, withal pro ducing all the money he was possessed of, and declaring by what means it came into his hands. Suidas adds, that årorgamin is sometimes taken for an action against such as neither paid the fines laid upon them , before

the ninth prytanea following their sentence , nor were able to give suffi cient surety to the city.
' Απόφασις was sometimes the same with'Απογραφή, as we learn from Suidas ; but was also usually taken for the account of estates given at the
exchange of them for the avoiding of public employment. For, when any man would excuse himself from any troublesome and chargeable trust, by casting it upon another richer than himself, the person produced by him had power to challenge him to make an exchange of estates, and thereby compel him to undergo the office he had before refused.
2. Þúois was commonly taken for the discovery of any hidden and con cealed injury, but more peculiarly signified an action laid against such
as exported corn out of Attica, embezzled the public revenues, and con
verted them to their own private use , or appropriated to themselves any of the lands or other things that of right belonged to the commonwealth , It is sometimes taken for an action against those that were guardians to
orphans, and either wholly neglected to provide tenants for the houses and lands, or let them at too easy a rate .
3. " Evdağış was against such as committed any action, or affected any
place of which they were incapable by law ; as when a person disfranchised , or indebted to the public, sued for offices in the state, or took upon him to determine controversies in a judicial way : also against those that con fessed the crimes laid to their charge, without standing the trial. 4. 'Araywon was the carrying of a criminal taken in the fact to the
magistrate . If the accuser was not able to bring him to the magistrate, it
was usual to take the magistrate along with him to the house where the criminal lay concealed, or defended himself; and this they called ionysios 80s, and the action iognois.
5. 'Ανδρολήψιον, or 'Ανδροληψία , was an action against such as protected persons guilty of murder, by which the relations of the deceased were
empowered to seize three men in the city or house, whither the malefactor
had fled, till he was either surrendered, or satisfaction made some other way for the murder,
6. Eivanginíc was of three sorts : the first was about great and public
offences, whereby the state was brought into danger. Such actions were not referred to any court of justice, but immediately brought before the
senate of five hundred, or the popular assembly , before whom it was intro duced by the thesmothetæ at the first convention in the Prytanea, where the delinquent was severely punished, but the plaintiff underwent no
danger, although he could not prove his indictment, except he failed of having the fifth part of the suffrages, and then he was fined a thousand
drachms . The second sort of Εισαγγελία was an action of Κάκωσις, of
which I shall speak in another place ; it was brought before the archon , to whom the plaintiff gave in his accusation , but was not liable to have any fine laid upon him, though sentence was given against him. The third
was an action against the Araitntai, preferred by persons that thought

themselves unjustly dealt with by them , who ran the hazard of being dis .
franchised , and forfeiting their freedom , if they were not able to make good their accusation . Indeed in all the forementioned accusations, the Eloayrtaíces orly excepted , this penalty, together with a fine of a thousand
drachms, was inflicted upon the plaintiff, if he had not the fifth part of the
suffrages.
CHAP. XXIV.
OF THE PRIVATE JUDGMENTS, ACTIONS, &c.
ΑΔΙΚΙΟΥ δίκη, an action κατά των οποσοτούν αδικούντων , αgainst such as
had done any sort of injury. A fine was laid on the delinquent, which
was to be doubled, if not paid within the ninth prytanea.2 Karnyogías dirn was an action of slander, by which the criminal was fined five hundred drachms,
Aixías díxn was an action of battery, in which case there was no set
penalty inflicted by the laws, but the judges took an account of the dama ges suffered by the plaintiff, and compelled the delinquent to make suffi cient retribution ,
B.ciwy, or Bices dixn, was an action against such as had ravished women, or used violence towards any man's person .
Baúßns dixn was an action of trespass, being against those that had endangered another man's estate, lands, houses, clothes, &c.
Κακώσεως δίκη, γραφή, οι εισαγγελία , was an action entered by heil esses against their husbands, by parents against their children, and orphans against their guardians, when they were ill used or injured by them .
'ATOTOTās dixn was an action of divorce, when the husband had put away his wife. On the contrary, when the woman fled from her husband , the action was called 'Aπoλείψεως δίκη. Klorñs dixn was against thieves. Demosthenes 3 reports, that if any man had stolen above fifty drachms in the daytime, he was to be indicted at the tribunal of the eleven. But if any theft was committed in the
night, it was lawful to kill the criminal, if he was caught in the fact, or
to pursue him , and if he made any resistance, to wound him , and so haul him to the eleven ; and this action was termed imaywyn. He was not
permitted to give security for restitution , but suffered death. person surreptitiously conveyed any thing of the smallest value out of the Lyceum, Academy, Cynosarges, or any of the gymnasia, or out of havens, above the value of ten drachms, he was adjudged to die. If any man was
convicted of theft from a private person , he was to make retribution to the
person he had injured, by paying him double the value of what he had 1 Etymologici Auctor.

deprived him of; nor was this punishment alone thought sufficient to expiate his offence, but it lay in the judge's power to keep him in bonds five days, and as many nights, and expose him in that condition to the
view of all the people. We are farther informed by Andocides, that åtipic , infamy was the punishment of this crime.
Παρακαταθήκης δίκη was against such as refused to restore any thing committed to their charge. Xpious díxen was a suit between debtors and usurers . Sup Borciou dixn was an action against those that would not stand to their
contracts or bargains. Not much different from this was Xvybnxãs dixn ; only Eureßórare are distinguished from Suvdñxar in this, that these chiefly
imply private contracts about the loan of money, division of inheritances, and references to the AsQITnTaí whereas, the others are extended, as well to
public negotiations between public bodies, as to bargains made by private persons. Others there are that acknowledge no such difference betwixt them .
Είς δατητών αίρεσιν δίκη was an action against such persons as would not
consent to make a division of goods or estates, wherein other men are sharers with them.
Διαδικασίας δίκη was an action περί χρημάτων , ή περί κτημάτων , concern
ing money or possessions, as it is defined by 2 Ulpian, and seems to be a
term of equal extent with αμφισβήτησις οι κρίσις , which are general names for all lawsuits. But it was sometimes taken in a more limited sense,
for the controversies of those, who being appointed to undergo some of the
public duties ( asitougzícs), excused themselves by informing against others more wealthy, as has been elsewhere shown.
’Esidirudias dixn, when daughters inherited the estates of their parents, they were obliged by law to marry their nearest relation . This was the occasion of this suit, which was commenced by persons of the same family,
each of which pretended to be more nearly allied to the heiress than the rest. The virgin , about whom the relations contested, was called ' Eridixos. 'Erizangos was a daughter, that had no brothers lawfully begotten, and therefore inherited her father's whole estate . 'Erikposmos was one that had brothers, and shared the estate with them .
'Aupuolárnois was a suit commenced by one that made pretensions to the estate of a deceased person , as being his son either by nature or adop tion . This term is sometimes taken in a larger sense .
Ilaparatubong was an action entered by the relations of the deceased,
whereby they claimed a right to his estate, as belonging to them by reason of their consanguinity , or bequeathed by will. It was so called are
του παρακαταβάλλειν, because the plaintif deposited the tenth part of the inheritance, if the cause was private, and the fifth, if it was a public estate he contended for ; this he was to forfeit if he could not make his plea good.

'Arroygap was a lawsuit about kindred , whereby any person claimed a relation to such or such a family , and therefore it seems to have been of the same nature with Παρακαταβολή.. Asclepagtupia was a protestation that the deceased person had left an heir,
made to hinder the relations from entering upon the estate.
Επίσκηψις was an action whereby the Διαμαρτυρία was proved to be false and groundless.
’Everiorem pepece was when any person claimed some part of another man's goods, which were confiscated and sold by auction . Eirov dixn, when a husband divorced his wife, the law obliged him to
restore her portion ; or, in case he refused that, to pay her for each pound nine oboli every month ; upon failure of which he was liable to have this
action entered against him in the Odeum by his wife's ' Extirpotos, or guardian, whereby he was forced to allow her a separate maintenance. Μισθώσεως οίκου , &c. δίκη , sometimes called Φάσεις, was an action against guardians who were negligent in the management of the affairs of their
pupils, and either let out their houses or estates at too small a price, or
suffered them to lie void of tenants. When any house was vacant, it was customary to signify such, by fixing an inscription upon the door, or some other part of it. 'Επιτροπής δίκη was an action against guardians that had defrauded their
pupils. It was to be commenced within five years after the pupil was come to age, otherwise it was of no.force .
'Evoxíou dixn, when any man laid claim to a house, he entered an action
against the person that inhabited it, whereby he demanded the rent of the house. If he claimed an estate of land, the action was called Xwgiov diren,
of Kaproữ díxn, because the fruits of the ground were demanded. If the plaintiff cast his adversary in either of the former suits, he entered a se cond action against him, whereby he laid claim to the house or land, as
being a part of his estate, for which reason it was called Ovoices dixn. After
this, if the person in possession continued obstinate, and would not deliver up the estate to the lawful owner , there was a third action commenced,
which was named ' Eğouans dirn, from iblaaw, to eject ; because the plain tiff was iš :aaópesvos, ejected, or hindered from entering upon his estate.
The same term was used when any other thing was unjustly detained from its owner, περί ανδραπόδου, και παντός ού φησί τις αυτό μετεϊναι con
cerning a slave, and every other thing which any person calls his own ; as we are informed by Suidas.
Βεβαιώσεως δίκη was an action whereby the buyer compelled the seller to confirm , or stand to the bargains which he before had given a pledge to ratify.

CHAP. XXV .
OF THE ATHENIAN PUNISHMENTS AND REWARDS .
The most common and remarkable punishments inflicted at Athens, on malefactors, were these ;
Znuia , which, though sometimes it be used in a large and general sense for any punishments, yet has often a more limited and restrained signifi cation, being taken for a pecuniary mulct, or fine, laid upon the criminal according to the merit of his offence.
'Ariya, infamy, or public disgrace. Of this there were three degrees: 1. When the criminal retained his possessions, but was deprived of some
privilege, which was enjoyed by other citizens. Thus, under the reign of
the tyrants, some were commanded to depart out of the city, others for bidden to make an oration to the people, to sail to Ionia, or to some other particular country. 2. When he was for the present deprived of the pri vileges of free citizens, and had his goods confiscated. This happened to those who were indebted to the public exchequer, till their debts were discharged. 3. When the criminal, with all his children and posterity , were for ever deprived of all rights of free citizens, both sacred and civil.
This was inflicted on such as had been convicted of theft, perjury, or other

notorious villanies. 1 Out of these men the Scholiast upon Aristophanes? tells us they appointed whom they pleased to labour at the oars ; to which drudgery, Plutarch reports, it was usual also to put their prisoners of war.3
Aovacío, servitude , was a punishment by which the criminal was re duced into the condition a slave. It was never inflicted on any besides
the " Atifedi, sojourners and freed servants , because it was forbidden by one
of Solon's laws that any freeborn citizen should be treated as a slave. Eriyuate was a severity seldom exercised upon any but slaves, or some very notorious malefactors, of which I have spoken more at large in another place.
Erhan was, as the word imports, a pillar, whereon was engraven , in legible characters, an account of the offender's crime. The persons thus exposed to the laughter and reproaches of the people were called Etnaitas.
Hence, ornasteurixòs aéyos is taken for any invective or defamatory ora tion , Aloros was a punishment by which the criminal was condemned to im
prisonment or fetters. " The prison was called by a lenitive name, Olun pea , or house ; for the Athenians used to mitigate and take off from the
badness of things by giving them good and innocent appellations; as a whore, they would call a mistress ; taxes, rates; garrisons, guards; and this, saith Plutarch , seemed at first to be Solon's contrivance , who called
the releasing of the people from their debts ouéx6110,4 a throwing off a burden .' Plato tells us, the Athenians had three sorts of prisons; the first
was near the forum , and was only designed to secure debtors or other per
sons from running away. The second was called IwQgovirtúgiov, or a house of correction , such as our bridewell. The third was seated in an uninha
bited and lonesome place, and was designed for malefactors guilty of capi tal crimes. One of their most remarkable prisons was called Nouopuká .
mlov, and the gate through which criminals were led to execution, X « pw .
velov, from Charon , the infernal ferryman . At the prison door was erected the image of Mercury, the tutelar deity of the place , called Stpopaños, from otpopeùs, the hinge of a door, Of fetters there were several sorts ; the most remarkable are these :
Kúpwy, a collar, usually made of wood, so called from rúttw , because it constrained the criminal to bow down his head . This punishment was
called Kupaniopòs, and hence pernicious fellows or things are sometimes named κύφωνες . Ηesychius will have it applied επί πάντων δυσχερών και
órstglwv, to all things hurtful and destructive. Others call it xãouds or Bootòs, from xasian, because the criminal's neck was shut or inclosed within it. Some grammarians tell us, the neck, hands, and feet, were made fast in it ; and therefore it is probable it was the same with the Ebkov TsvTsobgryzov, or fetters with five holes, mentioned by Pollux, and

seems to resemble the punishment of binding neck and heels, used amongst our soldiers. Aristophanes calls it fúzov Ts renuévoy.'
Ilavrinárn, a round engine put about the neck, in such a manner that the sufferer could not lift his hand to his head .
Xoing signifies fetters, in which the feet or legs were made fast, as we are informed by Aristophanes in his Plutus, where speaking of an insolent
slave, he saith he deserves to be set in the stocks:
You're ripe, you rogue, for fetters; the stocks Ίου , ιού τας χοίνικας, και τας πέδας ποθούσαι. groan for you.
Not much unlike this seems to have been the ποδοκάκη , ποδοκάκκη, or
Todootpéßn, sometimes called fúrov, from the matter it was made of."
But ποδοκάκκη and ποδοστράβη seem to have differed in this, that in ποδο oppáßn the feet were tortured ; whereas in sodoxáxxn they were only made fast without pain or distention of joints. Though perhaps this distinction
will not be found constant and perpetual. Zavis was a piece of wood to which the malefactor was bound fast. Besides these, many others occur
in authors, which barely to mention , would be both tedious and unneces sary .
' Burn, perpetual banishment, whereby the condemned persons were deprived of their estates, which were publicly exposed to sale, and com pelled to leave their country without any possibility of returning, unless they were recalled, (which sometimes happened ) by the same power that expelled them ; wherein it differed from ' Orriariopòs, which only com manded a ten years' absence, at the end of which, the banished persons
were permitted to return, and enjoy their estates, which were all that time preserved entire to them. The latter was instituted not so much
with a design to punish the offender, as to mitigate and pacify the fury of
the envious, ' that delighted to depress those that were eminent for their virtues and glorious actions, and by fixing this disgrace upon them , to exhale part of the venomous rancour of their minds. The first who under
went this condemnation was, as Plutarch reports, Hipparchus the Cho largian , a kinsman to the tyrant of the same name. Eustathius makes it
much more ancient, and carries it as high as Theseus' time, who, he tells us, out of Theophrastus and Pausanias, was the first that suffered it. Hera
clides will have it to have been first instituted by Hippias the tyrant, a
son of Pisistratus ;' Photius, by one Achilles, the son of Lyco ;" and Ælian, by Clisthenes, who also, as he tells us, was the first that under
went it. It was never inflicted upon any but great persons ; Demetrius the Phalerean, as Plutarch reports, will have it to have happened to none but men of great estates, and therefore, as an argument to prove the plen tiful condition of Aristides (whom he maintains to have been possessed of

a large fortune, contrary to the opinion of most other writers), he alleged , that he was banished by ostracism . But my author is of another opinion, and not without reason , for all persons were liable to the ostracism , who, for reputation, quality, riches, or eloquence, were esteemed above the common level, and exposed to the envy of the people, insomuch that even Damon , preceptor to Pericles, was banished thereby, because he seemed
a man of more than ordinary sense. Afterwards, when base, mean , and villainous fellows became subject to it, they quite left it off, Hyperbolus being the last whom they banished by ostracism . This Hyperbolus was
a very rascally fellow , who furnished all the writers of comedy in that age with matter for their satirical invectives ; but he was wholly uncon cerned at the worst things they could say, and being careless of glory, was also insensible of shame; he was neither loved nor esteemed by any,
body, but was a necessary tool to the people, and frequently made use of by them , when they had a mind to disgrace or calumniate any person of authority or reputation. The cause of his banishment was this: Alcibi,
ades, Nicias, and Phæax, at that time were of different factions, and each
of them bearing a great sway in the city, lay open to the envy of the inferior citizens, who, at Hyperbolus' persuasion , were very eager to
decree the banishment of some one of them . Alcibiades, perceiving the danger they were in, consulted with Nicias, or Phæax ( for it is not agreed
which), and so contrived matters, that by uniting their several parties, the ostracism fell upon Hyperbolus, when he expected nothing of it.. Hereupon the people being offended , as if some contempt or affront had been put upon the thing, left off, and quite abolished it. It was performed
in this manner : every one taking an orpaxov, or tile, carried it to a cer
tain part of the market-place, surrounded with wooden rails for that pur pose , in which were ten gates appointed for the ten tribes, every one of
which entered at a distinct gate. That being done, the archons numbered all the tiles in gross, for if they were fewer than six thousand, the ostra
cism was void ; then laying every name by itself, they pronounced him whose name was written by the major part, banished for ten years, enjoy ing his estate. This punishment was sometimes called Kepoepesixs ucotiš, from réganos, because the compara, by which the people gave their suf
frages, were earthen tiles, or pieces of broken pots. The like was used at Argos, Megara , and Miletus ;; and the Syracusian Istansenes was
instituted upon the same account, in the third year of the 86th Olympiad ; but differed from it in this, that this banishment was but for five years,
and instead of oorpance, the people made use of rítance, or leaves, usually those of the olive-tree, in giving their voices.4

Bpóxos, with which he was either strangled after the Turkish fashion,
or hanged in the manner usual amongst us ; for that this was a very anci
ent, but withal a very ignominious punishment, appears from Homer, in whom Ulysses and Telemachus punish the men that took part with the
young gentlemen who made love to Penelope, only with a common and ordinary death ; but the maid -servants that had submitted to their lusts,
and behaved themselves with scorn and contempt towards their masters, as being guilty of a more notorious crime, they ordered to be hanged .' Þáguaxov, poison , of which there were many sorts ; but what they most commonly made of was the juice of the herb rúvalov, cicuta , not much unlike hemlock , which , through its extreme coldness, is poisonous. A draught of this gave Socrates his death.2
Konuevos, a precipice, from which the malefactor was tumbled headlong. Tóutard , or Túrave, were cudgels of wood, with which malefactors
were beaten to death,3 being hanged upon a pole, which was also called Túpravov: and therefore tulemavistou is, by Suidas and the Etymologist,
expounded κρίμαται, and ετυμπανίσθησαν, εκρεμάσθησαν by Hesychius ; for their conceit is vain and ridiculous, who would thence infer it to have been a kind of gallows or cross . No less groundless is their opinion , who
imagine it to have been an instrument on which criminals were distended ,
like the covering of a drum, which the Greeks called Tújtavov, and to have been of the same nature with the Roman fidiculæ , which were little cords by which men were stretched upon the rack, and seem to have resembled the Greek σχοίνοι, used in the punishment called σχοινισμός .
Eraugos, the cross , mentioned in Thucydides,4 was used in Greece, but not so frequently as at Rome. It consisted of two beams, one of which
was placed across the other; the figure of it was much the same with that of the letter T, as Lucian tells us,5 differing only from it, because the transverse beam was fixed a little below the top of the straight one. The malefactor was hanged upon the beam that was erect, his feet being fixed to it with nails, and his hands to each side of that which was transverse.
Bága @ goy was a deep pit belonging to the tribe Hippothoontis, into which condemned persons were cast headlong, It is sometimes called
Opuyya, wlience the public executioner received the appellation of 'O ére : Tã égúypati. It was a dark noisome hole, and had sharp spikes at the top, that no man might escape out ; and others at the bottom, to pierce aud torment such as were cast in. From its depth and capaciousness, it came to be used proverbially for a covetous miser or voracious glutton, that is always craving, and can never be satisfied ; such a one the Latins called barathro.?
A place of the same nature was the Lacedæmonian Karádus, into which
Aristomenes the Messenian being cast, made his escape after a wonderful manner.s

Andoßraíce, or lapidation , was a common punishment, and usually inflicted
by the primitive Greeks upon such as were taken in adultery, as we learia from Homer. λάϊνον έσσο χιτώνα κακών νεκ', όσσα Εοργας . For all your villanies you shall be stoned to death.
Many other punishments there were, which they inflicted for particu
lar crimes, some of which I shall treat of in their proper places. As the laws inflicted severe penalties upon offenders, to deter men from vice and wickedness, and from base dishonourable designs, so they confer red ample rewards upon such as merited them , to incite others to the
practice of virtue and honesty, and the performance of good and glorious, actions; and upon the just and equal dispensation of these two things, it
was Solon's opinion, that the safety of the commonwealth chiefly depend ed.? Not to mention public honours and state -preferments, to which even
those of the inferior sort might not despair of advancing themselves in a popular state , if by their eminent services they approved themselves to
the people ; there were several public rewards and honours conferred upon such as were thought worthy of them ; the chief of which were these :
Ilgesogic, or the privilege of having the first place at all shows, sports, banquets, and public meetings .
Eixw , or the honour of having a picture or statue erected in the citadel, forum , or other public places of the city .* Eripavos, or crowns, were conferred in the public assemblies by the suf frages of the people, or by the senators in their council, or by the tribes,
to their own members, or by the Anjótar in their own ( dmuos) borough. The people were not allowed to present crowns in any place except their assembly , nor the senators out of the senate -house; it being the lawgiver's intention that the Athenians should αγαπάν εν αυτή τη πόλει τιμώμενοι υπό Sýpov, acquiesce in the honourspaid them by their own people, and not court , the favour and esteem other cities. For this reason , the Athenians
never rewarded any man with crowns in the theatre, and at the solemn games, where there was commonly a great concourse of people from all; parts of Greece ; and if any of the criers there proclaimed the crowns
with which any man's tribe or borough had presented him, he was punished with á topía , infamy. Eripavos gavixoi, corona hospitales,
were, notwithstanding, sometimes presented by foreign cities to parti cular citizens of Athens, but not till the ambassadors of those cities
had first obtained permission from the people of Athens, and the men for whom that honour was intended had undergone a public examination , wherein their course of life was inquired into. Lastly, the crowns pre
sented by the Athenians themselves to any of their own citizens, were kept in the families of those who had obtained them , as monuments of honour, and those which were sent from other cities were dedicated to
Minerva, the protectress of Athens. But as these were for the most part 1 Iliad , y'. v. 57.

bestowed upon those who had signalized themselves by their valour, I shall give a farther account in another place, when I come to speak of military rewards .
' Ariase was an immunity from all public duties, taxes, and contribu tions, except such as were required for carrying on the wars, and building ships, which no man was excused from , but the nine archons. This hon our was very rare ; but yet there were instances of it, as particularly those
of Harmodius and Aristogiton's whole families, which enjoyed it for many generations.
Στία , παρασιτία , σίδησις εν Πρυτανεία , was an entertainment given in the Prytaneum , to such as had deserved well of the commonwealth, and
in particular to those who had been ambassadors. Solon made a law that no man should be entertained in the Prytaneum oftener than once. But this being afterwards abolished , some were åsioitoi, constantly maintained
there ;s whence Socrates, being asked by the court what punishment he
thought himself to deserve ? replied, ut ei victus quotidianus in Prytaneo publicè præberetur, that they should allow him a constant maintenance
in the Prytaneum ;' qui honos apud Græcos maximus habetur, .which is reputed one of the greatest honours amongst the Greeks,” as we are in
formed by Cicero. Sometimes we find the privilege granted to whole families, for the service of their ancestors, as particularly to those of Hipà pocrates, Harmodius, and Aristogiton. Their common fare was a sort
of cakes, or puddings, called recézu. Upon holidays they had an allowance
of bread , which Solon appointed, pespecúpesvos tòn " Opencov, in imitation of Homer, whose heroes used to feast in that manner . Besides other provi
sions, the tenths of all the bellies of animals offered in sacrifice were
always reserved for them ; which if any man neglected to send, he was liable to be punished by the πρυτάνες .
Such as had received any honour or privilege from the city, were under its more particular care and protection ; and the injuries done to them were resented as affronts to the whole commonwealth : insomuch, that
whoever did üßeisevy, tatárreiv, narūs tintiv, affront, strike, or speak ill of any such person, was by the law declared ripos, infamous.” If the children of those who had been eminently serviceable to the common wealth were left in a poor condition , they seldom failed of obtaining a plen tiful provision from the public : thus Aristides' two daughters were publicly married out of the Prytaneum , the city decreeing each of them three hun dred drachms for her portion. Nor is it to be wondered, says Plutarch, that the people of Athens should take care of those who lived in the
city, since, hearing that Aristogiton's grand -daughter was in a low con dition in the isle of Lemnos, and on account of her poverty like to want a husband, they sent for her to Athens, married her to a person of consi derable quality , and bestowed upon her a large farm as a dowry. Of which

bounty and humanity , says he, this city of Athens, even in this age , has given many demonstrations, for which she is deservedly held in great
honour and admiration.1
Whilst the ancient virtue and glory of the Athenians lasted, it was ex ceedingly difficult to obtain any of the public honours: insomuch , that when Miltiades, after he had delivered Greece from the Persian army at Marathon , petitioned for a crown , he received this answer from one of the people, That when he conquered alone he should be crowned alone. But
in the days of Aristophanes honours were more common . In later ages, the Athenians grew lavish of their public honours, as may be seen from the stories of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and Demetrius the Phalerean ," to
which we have already alluded.
CHAP. XXVI .
OF THE ATHENIAN LAWS.
;
It was an observation of Cicero, that most of the arts and inventions which are necessary to the management of human life owe their origin to the
Athenians, from whom they were carried into the other parts of Greece, and thence spread among foreign countries for the common benefit of man kind. But of all the inventions commonly ascribed to them , none has been of greater or more general use to the world than that of laws, which, as Æliano and others record , were first established in Athens ; though some ascribe the first invention of laws to Zaleucus the Locrian , or to
Minos, king of Crete . Most other ingenious contrivances respect the
conveniences of human life, but upon this depends the very foundation of all civil government, and of all mutual society amongst men ; for by them
the magistrate is directed how to govern , and the people how far to obey ; the magistrate by them is settled in the possession of his authority over the
people, and the people, too, by them are secured from the arbitrary power and unreasonable demands of the magistrate, as well as from the fraud,
violence, and oppression of each other. The poets tell us, that Ceres first taught the Athenians the use of laws, and to commemorate this benefit, the festival Osopopógice was celebrated, in which she was worshipped by the name of Osojopogos, the Legislatrix , which
exactly answers to the Latin name of Legifera in Virgil. The occasion of
this opinion seems to have been, their ascribing to this goddess the invention of tillage. After this, the lands being not as yet divided into equal por tions, controversies used to be raised ; for the composing ofwhich Ceres gave

directions which afterwards were imitated in all other affairs. Some of
the laws of her favourite Triptolemus are still extant. But to pass by poetical fictions, this much is certain , that the Athenians were governed
by laws before the dissolution of their monarchy, as may be observed from what Plutarch relates of Theseus, namely, that when he divested himself
of sovereign power , and established a commonwealth in Athens, one of
the prerogatives that he thought fit still to retain , was the custody or pro tection of the laws.
The first who gave laws to the Athenians after Theseus was Draco, .who was archon in the first year of the 39th Olympiad. Hislaws, Ælian tells us, were properly called Oscuoi, but were remarkable for nothing but
their unreasonable severity ; for by them every little offence was punished with death , and he that stole an apple was proceeded against with no less rigour than he that had betrayed his country . But these extremities could
not last long ; the people soon grew weary of them, and therefore, though they were not abrogated, yet by tacit consent they fell into desuetude, till Solon , the next lawgiver, repealed them all, except those which concerned
murder, called povizoù vouos ; and, having received from the people power to make what alterations he thought necessary , new -modelled the common
wealth, and instituted a great many useful and excellent laws, which, to distinguish them from Draco's Oopol, were called Nómon. Lest, through the connivance of the magistrates, they should in time be neglected , like those of his predecessor, he caused the senate to take a solemn oath to observe them ; and every one of the thesmothetæ vowed , that if he violated
any of the statutes, he would dedicate a golden statue as big as himself to
the Delphian Apollo ; and the people came under an obligation to observe them for a hundred years.?
But all this care was not sufficient to preserve his laws from the inno vations of lawless and ambitious men ; for shortly after, Pisistratus so far
insinuated himself into the people's favour, that the democracy instituted by Solon was dissolved, and himself invested with sovereign power , which , at his death , he left in the possession of his sons, who maintained it for some
years. Though Pisistratus himself, as Plutarch reports, and his sons after
him , in a great measure, governed according to Solon's directions, yet they followed them not as laws, to which they were obliged to conform their actions, but rather seem to have used them as wise and prudent counsels, and varied from them whenever they found them to interfere with their interest or inclinations.
The family of Pisistratus being driven out of Attica , Clisthenes under took to restore the constitutions of Solon, and enacted many new laws,* which continued in force till the Peloponnesian war, when the form of
government was changed, first by the four hundred, and then by the thirty tyrants. These storms being over, the ancient laws were again restored

in the archonship of Euclides, and others established at the instance of
Diocles, Aristophon, and other leading men of the city. Last of all, De
metrius the Phalerean being intrusted with the government of Athens by the Macedonians, was the author of many new , but very beneficial and laudable constitutions. These seem to have been the chief legistators of
Athens, before she submitted to the Roman yoke; two others are men
tioned by Suidas, namely, Thales and Æschylus. Besides these , the Athenians had a great many other laws, enacted upon particular exigencies by the suffrages of the people ; (not to speak of
Ynpionate rñs Bovañs, the decrees enacted by the authority of the sena tors, whose power being only annual, their decrees lost all their force and
obligation when their offices expired .) The manner of making a law was
this: when any man had devised a measure ,which he thought might con duce to the good of the commonwealth, he first communicated it to the
prytanes, who received all informations of things that concerned the pub
lic : the prytanes then called a meeting of the senate, in which the new
project, after mature deliberation, was rejected, if it appeared hurtful or
unserviceable ; but if otherwise, it was agreed to, and then called Ilgosos asupic . This the prytanes wrote upon a tablet, and thence it was called
Πρόγραμμα . No law was to be proposed to the assembly unless it had been written
upon a white tablet, and fixed up; some days before the assembly , at the statues of the heroes called 'Etrúvuoi, that so all the citizens might read
what was to be proposed at their next meeting, and be able to give a more deliberate judgment upon it. When the multitude assembled , the decree
was read , and every man had liberty to speak his mind about the whole,
or any clause of it : and if, after due consultation, the assembly thought it
inconvenient, it was rejected ; if they approved of it, it passed into a ¥ n @ io . Mac or Nóxos, which were the same as to their obligation, but differed in
this, that Nópos was a general and everlasting rule, whereas hoopia re spected particular times, places, and other circumstances, No man , without a great deal of caution, and a thorough understanding
of the former laws and constitutions, durst presume to propose a new one, the danger being very great, if it suited not with the customs and inclina
tions of the people. Not much unlike this severity was the ordinance of
Zaleucus the Locrian lawgiver, that whosoever proposed the enacting of a new law , or the abrogation of an old one, should come into the assembly
with a halter about his neck, and in that habit give his reasons for what he proposed , and, if these were thought good and sufficient, his proposal was embraced ; if not, he straightway poured out his soul under the hang
man's hands. But the Athenians were not quite so rigid , except upon some extraordinary occasions, when the giddy multitude was hurried on
with unusual rage and vehemence. If any man established a law that

CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. 145
was prejudicial to the commonwealth, he might be called in question for it any time within the space of one year ; after that period , the laws took no notice of him . If he had not published his proposal in due time, if he proposed it in ambiguous and fallacious terms, or, if he proposed any
thing contrary to any of the former and received laws, —a writ for trans
gressing the laws, called Ilagavopias ogaon, might take hold of him ; and therefore, if any of the old laws were found to oppose what they designed to offer, they always took care to have them repealed beforehand .' Those who had preferred a law , which was supávopos, or årstitúdenos, contrary
to the former laws, or the interest of the commonwealth, were first arraigned before the thesmothetæ , or , sometimes before the thesmo
thetæ and sometimes before the other archons, according to the dif ferent nature of their crimes, every arehon having the cognizance of dif
ferent affairs. The accusation being heard, the archon did siráya się dizarthgrov, introduce the cause into that court of justice where such affairs were examined. If the defendant was declared guilty, he was usually punished by a fine proportioned to his offence, which he was obliged to pay under the penalty of ( & tiuia ) infamy. This last punishment was imme diately inflicted on those who had been thrice convicted of this offence , and who were, on that account, ever after excluded from all public assem blies,
If the judges acquitted the defendant, then the plaintiff was amerced in a thousand drachmæ , as á punishment of his false accusation . Though he,
who had been the occasion of enacting any unjust law , could not be pun ished after a whole year was expired, yet it was lawful to cite him before a magistrate , and there compel him to show the design and tendency of his law , to prevent any damage which might ensue from it. But as, not withstanding all this caution, it sometimes happened that new laws were enacted contrary to the old, it was ordered that the thesmothetæ should
carefully peruse the laws once every year ; and if they found any of them oppose another, it was to be proposed to the people , who were to proceed about it in the method that was used in abrogating other laws, and so one
of the laws should be made void . In other cases, it was unlawful for any man to endeavour to have any law repealed, without preferring a new one in its place.
As the change of time and other circumstances make great alterations in affairs, and as ordinances, which were formerly useful and necessary,
by the different state of things become unprofitable, and perhaps incon venient and prejudicial, it was ordained by Solon that once every year the laws should be carefully revised and examined, and that if any of them
were found unsuitable to the present state of affairs, it should be repealed ; this was called επιχειροτονία των νόμων, from the manner of giving their suffrages, by holding up their hands. The method of doing it was this :

on the 11th day of the month Hecatombæon , when the prytanes held their
first stated assembly, after the Kagut had, according to custom , made a solemn prayerbefore the assembly, the laws were read over in this order: first, those that concerned the senate ; next, those that respected the people
and the nine archons, and then the other magistrates in their order . This being done, it was demanded, whether the laws then in being were suffi cient for the commonwealth ? and if it seemed necessary to make any
alteration in them, the consideration was deferred till the fourth of Met
agitnion, upon which day was the last stated assembly , under the first rank of the prytanes, as the repetition of the laws had been at the first.
In all this, the ocopo, or laws concerning such matters, were nicely and punctually observed , and the prytanes and proëdri severely punished, if any thing was omitted . For this was the difference between olomos and
Νόμος, that θεσμός έστι νόμος πώς έδει νομοθεσεων : Θεσμος ές α Ια directing how laws (vóje os) are to be made. Upon the first of Metagitnion, another assembly was called, and the proëdri reported the matter to the people, who did not proceed to the determination of it themselves, but substituted
the nomothetæ to do it ; and appointed five orators, called Zúrdıxos, to de fend the ancient laws in the name of the people. If the prytanes neglected
to convene the forementioned assembly , they were to be fined a thousand drachmæ ; but if the assembly met, and the proëdri then neglected to
propound the law to the people, they were fined only forty drachmæ ; örı βαρύτερόν έστιν όλως το μη συνάξαι τον δήμον εις την εκκλησίας, του μη υπο Bázası " It being a greater crime to neglect the calling of the people to gether, than the propounding of any particular business to them . Any
man was permitted to arraign the prytanes and proëdri, thus offending, before the thesmothetæ , whom the laws obliged to impeach the criminals in the court of heliæa, upon neglect of which they were denied admission into the senate of Areopagus. The nomothetæ having heard what the
orators could say in defence of the old law , gave their opinions accor dingly, and their sentence was ratified by the people in the following assembly .? Solon, and after his example, the rest of those that enacted laws in
Athens, committed their laws to writing,8 differing herein from Lycurgus, and the law givers of other cities, who thought it better to imprint them in the minds of their citizens than to engrave them upon tablets, where it was probable they might lie neglected and unregarded , as Plutarch hath

informed us in his life of Numa Pompilius: It is reported ,' says he, that
Numa's body, by his particular command, was not burned , but that he ordered two stone coffins to be made, in one of which he appointed his body to be laid , and the other to be a repository for his sacred books and writings, and both of them to be interred under the hill Janiculum ; imi. tating herein the legislators of Greece, who having wrote their laws on
tablets, which they called Kugbees, did so long inculcate the contents of them whilst they lived, into the minds and hearts of their priests, that their understandings became as it were living libraries of those sacred volumes, it being esteemed a profanation of such mysteries to commit their secrets unto dead letters .' In some places, especially before the invention of letters, it was usual to sing their laws, the better to fix them
in their memories ; which custom , Aristotle tells us, was used in his days among the Agathyrsi, a people near the Scythians; and this he fancies
was the reason why musical rules for keeping time were called Nópos.?
But Solon was of a contrary opinion, esteeming it the safest way to commit his laws to writing, which would remain entire , and impossible
to be corrupted , when the unwritten traditions of other lawgivers, through the negligence and forgetfulness of some, and the cunning and knavery of others, might either wholly perish in oblivion , or by continual forgeries and alterations be rendered not only altogether unprofitable to the public, but abundantly serviceable to the designs and innovations of treacherous and ambitious men, Whence we find an express law , árpáow róneau sàs
ágzàs pen xeñotas pendi regi švòs, that nu magistrate should in any case
make use of an unwritten law . The tablets in which Solon penned his laws, Plutarch tells us, were of wood, called " Ağoves, and so fashioned that
they might be turned round in oblong cases ; some of them, he says, remained till his time, and were to be seen in the Prytaneum at Athens,
being, as Aristotle affirms, the same with the Kúgßs. But others are of opinion , that those were properly called Kúgßers, which contained the laws concerning ces, and the rites of religion ; and all the rest

Aristotle adds, in his account of the republic of Athens, that they were triangular, and is seconded herein by Pollux ,5 who farther remarks, that the “ Açores were quadrangular, and made of brass. Ammonius 6 will have the distinction to consist in this : that
the Açoves were four-square, containing the laws that concerned civil affairs ; whereas the Kúgßeis were triangular, and contained precepts about
the worship of the gods. What number there was of them it is impossibie

to divine, since none of the ancient authors have given us any light in this particular. They were kept in the citadel, but afterwards removed
to the Prytaneum , that all persons might have recourse to them upon any occasion ;' though some report, that only transcripts of them were carried
thither, and that the original, written by Solon's own hand, remained still in the citadel. Hence, as Pollux of opinion , the laws came to be dis
tinguished into τους κάτωθεν and τους άνωθεν νόμους, the former signifying the laws that were in the Prytaneum , which was in the lower city, the
latter those that were kept in the citadel or upper city. Others are of opinion, that by é zétwley vópos, Demosthenes, whose expression it is, meant no more than the lower part of the tablet : but then, without dis pute, he would have mentioned the number of the tablets , as in other places he and others usually do, and not have left us in the dark which of the
tablets he meant. Besides, the lower part of the tablet might sometimes happen to contain the first part of the law , which it is improper to call tòx xátwbev, because that word seems to import something beneath the rest, and towards the latter end ; for one tablet was not always large enough to contain a whole law , as appears from Plutarch , in whom we find that the eighth law was engraved in the thirteenth tablet . Petitus will have De
mosthenes to mean no more by ó zárubsy vágos than the law which beneath , or afterwards in the same oration, is cited by him. Others understand it
of the lower line, because the laws are said to have been written Bourtee onòòr, which is, as Pausanias explains it,' when the second line is turned on the contrary side, beginning at the end of the former, as the husband
men turn their oxen in ploughing, in this manner : EK AIO Y AP VOZWOX
It was against the law for any man to erase a decree out of any of the tablets, or to make any alterations in them ; and for their greater security,
there were certain persons, called from their office receperearsīs, whose ness it was to preserve them from being corrupted,* and, as their name imports, to transcribe the old, and enter the new ones into the
tablets: they were elected by the senate ; and to render their office more creditable, had several marks of honour conferred upon them . That no
mån might pretend ignorance of his duty, the laws were all engraved on
the wall in the Beoinoxnoroc , or royal portico, and there exposed to public view. But this custom was not begun till after the thirty tyrants were
expelled . Thus much of the Athenian laws in general: their particular laws, most of which have been collected by Samuel Petitus, were the fol lowing :

This law was enacted to restrain the old comedy, wherein men
were reflected on by name.* Let all the different airs and specific kinds of music be observed , and
each of them be made use of at its peculiar festival. This was an ancient law, whereby they who confounded the several kinds of music, being first
convicted before the masters of music, were liable to be punished. But this practice was afterwards laid aside.5
All spectators shall sit with due attention and decorum in the theatre, and the archons shall cause their sergeants to turn him out who shall
cause any noise or disturbance; but if any one persevere in his rudeness a fine shall be his punishment . This law relates to the Dionysia, where the chief archon was president, the care of other games being committed to other magistrates, as that of the Lenæa, and of the Anthesteria, to the Βασιλεύς ..
Sports exhibited in honour of Neptune are to be in the Piræeus, graced with three dances performed in a ring, where the reward to those who
come off best shall be ten prasī; to those whose performance is one degree below , eight, and to the third victors, six. This law was enacted by Lycurgus the orator .?

As for the review of the laws (ixtiysigotovíce vállas), I have purposely omitted it, as being spoken of in the former part of this chapter.
The
Decree
.
Tisamenus
hath
established
with
the
consent
and
by
the
authority
of
the
people
,
that
Athens
shall
keep
her
ancient
form
of
government,
and
make
use
of
Solon's
laws
,
weights
,
and
measures
,
with
Draco's
sanctions,
as
hitherto
:
if
new
ones
shall
seem
requisite
,
the
nomothetæ
,
created
by
the
senate
for
that
purpose
,
shall
engross
them
on
a
tablet
,
and
hang
them
up
at
the
statues
of
the
Eponymi,
that
they
may
be
exposed
to
the
public
view
of
all
passers
by
;
the
same
month
they
are
to
be
given
up
to
the
magistrates
,
after
they
have
obtained
the
estimation
of
the
senate
of
five
hundred
,
and
the
delegated
pomothetæ
.
Be
it
also
farther
enacted
,
that
any
private
man
may
have
free
access
to
the
senate
,
and
give
in
his
sen
timents
concerning
them
.
After
their
promulgation
,
the
senate
of
Area
pagus
is
required
to
take
care
that
the
magistrates
put
these
laws
in
exe
cution
,
which
,
for
the
conveniency
of
the
citizens
,
are
to
be
engraved
on
the
wall
,
where
before
they
had
been
exposed
to
public
view.9
This
law
was
enacted
after
Thrasybulus
had
expelled
the
thirty
tyrants
.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. 153
The
proposer
He that propounds a law contrary to the common good shall be indicted .' See as before . ofa law, after the year's end, shall be accused, if his law
be pernicious, but yet shall be liable to no penalty. See as before,
No law shall be repealed before reference be made of it to the nomo thetæ , which being done, any Athenian may endeavour its repeal, sup posing he substitutes a new law in its stead . Both these the proëdri shall refer to the votes of the people: the first proposal shall be concerning the old law , whether it be any longer conducible to the public good ; then the
new one shall be proposed, and which of the two the nomothetæ shall
judge best, that shall be in force; yet this caution must be observed, that no law shall be enacted, which gainsays any of the rest ; and the person who shall give in a law inconsistent with the former constitutions, shall be
dealt with according to the rigour of the act against those who promote prejudicial laws.2 See as before.
He who, to abrogate an old law , promiseth to make a new one, and doth not, shall be fined ."
The thesmothetæ shall yearly assemble in the repository of the laws,
and cautiously examine whether one law bears any contradiction to
another : whether there be any law unratified , or duplicates about the same things. If any of these shall occur in their examination , it shall be
written on a tablet, and published at the statues of the Eponymi: which done, by the epistata's order the people shall vote which of them shall be made void , or ratified . See as before, No man shall enact a law in favour of any private person , unless six
thousand citizens give leave by private votes. This was one of Solon's laws.
It shall be a capital crime for any man to cite a fictitious law in any court of justice .
The laws shall be in force from the archonship of ' Euclides. This law was enacted after the expulsion of the thirty tyrants, and intimates, that
what had been done under their usurpation should not henceforth be in quired into, an act of amnesty having been passed. Diocles hath enacted, that the laws which were made during the free dom of the commonwealth, before Euclides was archon, and also those that
were made in his archonship, shall be in full force henceforward . Those which have been enacted since the archonship of Euclides, or hereafter to
be enacted, shall be in force from the day wherein each of them shall be enacted , unless a particular time, wherein their force shall begin is speci fied in the law. Those which are now in force, shall be transcribed into
the public records by the notary of the senate within thirty days ; but the laws hereafter to be made shall be transcribed, and begin to be in force
from the day of their being enacted . This law gave perpetual force and

Laws referring to Decrees of the Senate and Commonalty.
Ympionata , or decrees of the senate, are to be but of one year's con tinuance. See book i. chap. 18.
No psephism shall pass to the commons before the senate's supervisal.2 One of Solon's laws. See as before.

the

Let no psephism be of greater authority than the laws, the senate , or the people.
No sophistication is to be contained in a psephism.5
Lauis concerning Native and Enfranchised Citizens.
All laws are to be alike obligatory towards the whole body of the people. One of Theseus' laws.6
All priests and archons are to be elected out of the nobility ( evtargidas), whose duty it is to interpret all laws, both civil and divine. Another of Theseus' laws. See book i, chap. 3.
The oñtes, or those of the meanest sort, shall be capable of no magis tracy. This and the following law are Solon's. See book i, chap. 4 .
The oñres shall have right of suffrage in public assemblies, and of being elected judges. Let all the citizens have an equal share in the government, and the
archons be indifferently elected out of them all. This law was enacted by Aristides.9 See book i . chap. 11 .
No persons but such as have suffered perpetual banishment, or those who with their whole families have come to Athens for the conveniency of trade, shall be enrolled among the denizens. One of Solon's laws.10 See
book i. chap. 9.
Let no person that is a slave by birth be made free of the city.11 See book i. chap. 10. No one shall be admitted citizen , unless a particular eminence of virtue entitle him to it : and if the people do confer a citizenship on any one for his merits, he shall not be ratified, before the Athenians, at the next
meeting of the assembly, honour him with six thousand private votes ; the prytanes likewise shall give them, before the entrance of the strangers, the boxes with the calculi, and take away the largesses. Now these persons,
after enfranchisement, shall be altogether incapable of being archons or priests; as for their children they may officiate, if born of a free woman ; if the persons made free presume the taking up of any office, any free

register of citizens, be so or not ; they who shall not be found citizens on both sides, let them be erased out. The determination of this shall be by
their own borough, by whom , if they be cast, and acquiesce in their sen
tence, without any further appeal to a higher court, they shall be ranked among the sojourners; but they that after appe shall be condemned by the higher court, shall be sold for slaves ; or acquitted, shall continue in
their freedom . See as before . This law was enacted when Archias was archon .
It is permitted any Athenian to leave the city, and take his family and goods along with him .S
Laws appertaining to Children , Legitimate, Spurious, or Adopted.
They only shall be reckoned citizens whose parents are both so. See book i. chap. 9. This law was enacted at the instance of Pericles. He shall be looked on as a bastard whose mother is not free . This was
enacted by Aristophon the orator . Let none of spurious birth, whether male or female, inherit either in sacred or civil things, from the time of Euclides being archon ..
That inheritance shall pass for good, which is given by a childless per son to an adopted son .”
Adoption must be made by persons living :8 that is, not by their last testament.
No one, except the person who adopted shall have a legitimate son, shall relinquish the family into which he is adopted, to return into his natural. One of Solon's laws. See book iv. chap. 15.
Parents may give their children what names they will, or change those that they have for others. 10 See book iv. chap. 14.
Whenever parents come to enrol their children, whether genuine or
adopted, in the public register of the ogátogas, they are obliged to profess by oath, that they were lawfully begotten of a free woman.11 See book i.

a goat to weigh fifty from, and two sheep forty -eight.

and he shall be reputed by me wholly free from guilt, in respect of the gods or dæmons, who will take away his life, or encourage another to do it : farther, in the distribution of his goods, I will pass my vote that the slayer
shall have half; and he that in the attempt shall have the misfortune to
lose his own life, shall, with his heirs, have due respect and honour from me, as Harmodius and Aristogiton, with posterity .

says Nonnus, 1 devotion was called egnozela, 9. Oganic , because it was in vented by a Thracian .
These, I think, were neither altogether in the right, nor yet wholly mistaken ; for as the exact agreement betwixt some of the Grecian cere
monies and the religious worship of Thrace, makes it probable that the
one was derived from the other ; so, on the other side, the conformity of some other parts of the Grecian religion to that of the Egyptians, doth plainly argue that they were fetched from Egypt; but that the whole sys tem of the Grecian religion should be borrowed from either Thrace, or Egypt, or any one country, is improbable if not impossible ; as will evi.
dently appear to every one who considers the great variety of religions in Greece , where almost every city had different gods, and different modes
of worship. It is much more probable that Greece, being inhabited by colonies from various nations, borrowed from every one of these some part
of their religious ceremonies. Thus the Thebans, being descended from
the Phoenicians, retained a great part of their worship ; and the Argives are thought to have been instructed in the Egyptian religion by Danaus and his followers. Cecrops, the founder of Athens, who was the first that worshipped Jupiter by the name of " Tramos, the Supreme, and introduced
civility among the barbarous Athenians, was likewise an Egyptian : whence some think he had the title of dipuns, one with two natures; őri Aiguatios
ών, τας δύο γλώσσας ήπίστατο, because being an Egyptian, he spoke two ( that is, the Egyptian and Athenian ) languages. Phoroneus, who is by some 3 reported to have brought the use of temples, altars, and sacrifices
into Greece, was of the same nation . So many of the Egyptian ceremonies and customs were received at Athens, that one of the comedians upbraids the Athenians, that
Αίγυπτος την πόλιν αυτών πεποιήκασιν αντ' 'Αθηνών .
They had made their city to be Egypt instead of Athens. Add to this, that the Greeks in general, and the Athenians in particular, were so
excessively superstitious, that they would not be content to worship their ancient deities, but frequently consecrated new ones of their own making ; and besides these, assumed into the number of their own the gods of all the nations with which they had any commerce; insomuch that, even in Hesiod's time, they were reis púgios, thirty thousand,

strange gods ; hence they religiously observed the Osoživia , or feast of all the strange gods; which was also celebrated at Delphi, as Athenæus wit
Nay , so afraid were the Athenians of omitting any , that, as Pausanias 2 tells us, they erected altars to unknown gods. It may be objected , that they condemned Socrates for no other crime than worship ping strange gods ; for that this was his accusation , Laërtius witnesses in his life . But to this it is replied, that though they were so desirous of
new deities, yet none were worshipped till they had been approved, and
admitted by the Areopagites, as Harpocration has observed ; and hence, when St Paul preached amongst them Jesus and the Resurrection , he
was summoned to appear before this council, to give an account of his new doctrine .
CHAP. II .
OF THEIR TEMPLES, ALTARS, IMAGES , GROVES, ASYLA, AND SACRED FIELDS.
The first generations of men had neither temples nor statues for their gods, but worshipped towards heaven in the open air. The Persians, even in
ages when temples were common in all other countries, őri oor åvfqwTo φυέας ενόμισαν τους θεούς, καθάπερ οι Έλληνες , not thinking the gods to be of human shape, as did the Greeks, had no temples :* which was the rea
son , as some think, why Xerxes burned and demolished the temples of Greece ; for the Persians thought it absurd to confine the gods within walls, quorum hic mundus omnis templum esset ac domus, whose house and tem
ple was this whole world, ' to use the words of Cicero. The Greeks and
most other nations, worshipped their gods upon the tops of high mountains. Hence Jupiter in Homer commends Hector for the many sacrifices which he had offered upon the top of Ida. Strabo observes, that the Persians had neither images nor altars, but only sacrificed to the gods ir uynaã Tókm , upon some high place . Thus Cyrus, in Xenophon , sacrifices to
paternal Jupiter, the sun , and the rest of the gods, upon the summits of mountains, 's Ilégoun Dúovoiv, as the Persians are wont to sacrifice. The nations which lived near Judea sacrificed also upon the tops of mountains. Balak , king of Moab, carried Balaam to the top of Bahal, and other mountains, to sacrifice to the gods, and curse Israel from thence. The
same custom is attested in almost innumerable places of the sacred scrip
tures ; but I shall add only one testimony more in proof of its antiquity. Abraham was commanded by God to offer Isaac his son for a burnt -offer

ing upon one of the mountains in the land of Moriah .) In later ages , the temples were often built upon the summits of mountains. Thus it is ob served of the Trojan temples, in which the fore -mentioned sacrifices are supposed to have been offered by Hector. Both at Athens and Rome the
most sacred temples stood in the most eminent part of the city. It is farther observable, that very high mountains were commonly held sacred
to Saturn or Jupiter, and sometimes to other gods, particularly to Apollo,
as we are informed by Homer, who thus addresses him : Πάσαι δε σκοπιαί τε φίλαι , και πρώονες άκροι Thine all the caverns, and the topmost cliffs
“Υψηλών ορέων.2. Of lofty mountains. Concerning this custom, I have more copiously treated in my com
mentary upon Lycophron . What was the occasion and origin of it may be disputed. However, it appears to have been continued in the heathen world : because the tops of the mountains approached nearest to the heavens, the seat of the gods. Hence Tacitus in his Annals speaks of
certain mountains, which maximè cælo appropinquare, precesque morta lium à Deo nusquam propius audire, came exceedingly near to the heavens, and alleges that there was in no place a nearer passage for the prayers of men to the gods than from them .' Lucian expressly affirms,
that the priests chiefly frequented such places, ότι των ευχωλέων αγχόθεν
įtarovoiy oi Isoi, because the gods did thence more easily hear their prayers, Who it was that erected the first temple , is not agreed by ancient writers.
Some ascribe it to Phoroneus the Egyptian, others to Merops, others, among whom is Varro, to Æacus the son of Jupiter . Some will have Jupiter to have been the first who built temples, and on that account to have been reputed the first and principal god . The Egyptians refer the invention to Isis, the Phrygians to Uso. Others rather choose to de rive it from Cecrops, the founder of Athens, or Dionysius, otherwise called Bacchus. Some mention the Arcadians, or Phrygians, or Thraci
ans, or Cretans, as the first founders of temples. Others name, in parti cular , Milisseus, king of Crete. Lastly, many are of opinion , that temples owe their origin to the superstitious reverence and devotion paid by the ancients to the memory of their deceased friends, relations, and benefactors ;5 and as most of the gods were men consecrated on account of some public benefit conferred on mankind , so most of the heathen temples are thought to have been at first only stately monuments erected
in honour of the dead . Thus the temple of Pallas, in the tower of the city Larissa, was the sepulchre of Acrisius ; Cecrops was interred in the Acropolis of Athens, and Erichthonius in the temple of Minerva Polias.
A farther confirmation of this is, that those words, which in their proper
acceptation signify no more than a tomb, or sepulchre, are by ancient writers applied to the temples of the gods. Lycophron , a noted affecter of obsolete words, has used túrßos 6 in this sense, (where he speaks of

Diomedes, who, at his return from Troy, was laid in wait for by his wife Ægialea, and forced to take sanctuary in the temple of Juno,) and Virgil,' has tumulus. Nor is it wonderful that monuments should at length be
converted into temples, when at every common sepulchre it was usual to
offer prayers, sacrifices, and libations; but of these more hereafter. Temples were built and adorned with all possible splendour and magni
ficence ; no pains, no charge, was spared upon them , or any part of divine
worship. This they did, partly out of the great respect they had for the gods, to whom they thought nothing more acceptable than costly orna ments ; and partly, that they might create a reverence of the deities in those who came to pay their devotions there. The Lacedæmonians only
nad a law amongst them, that every one should serve the gods with as little expense as he could, herein differing from all other Greeks and
Lycurgus being asked for what reason he made this institution , so dis agreeable to the sentiments of all other men, answered , Lest at any time the service of the gods should be intermitted ; for he feared, that if reli
gion should be as expensive as in the other parts of Greece, it might some time or other happen that the divine worship, out of the covetousness of some, and poverty of others, would be neglected ; and wisely considered, that magnificent edifices and costly sacrifices were not so pleasing to the gods, as the true piety and unfeigned devotion of their worshippers. This opinion of his was confirmed by the oracle of Hammon ;" for the Atheni
ans being defeated by the Lacedæmonians, in many encounters both by land and sea , sent to Jupiter Hammon , to inquire what means they had best use to obtain victory over their enemies ; and withal to ask him why
the Athenians who, said they, serve the gods with more pomp and splen dour than all the Greeks besides, should undergo so many misfortunes,
whilst the Lacedæmonians, whose worship is very mean and slovenly, are always crowned with success and victory ? The oracle made them no other answer , but, That the honest unaffected service of the Lacedæmoni
ans was more acceptable to the gods, than all the splendid and costly
devotions of other people. The reader will pardon this digression, since it doth so fully and clearly set forth the temper of two of the most flour ishing states of Greece.
Sometimes the same temple was dedicated to several gods, who were
thence termed σύνναοι or συνοικέται, as they who had the same altar in common were called opoßüusos. This we find in the medal mentioned by
Saubertus, with the following inscription : AII HAINI

To Jupiter, the Sun , great Serapis, and the gods who cohabit in the same temple. Thus also were joined in one temple, Isis and Apis ; in another, Ceres, Bacchus, and Phoebus ; in another at Rome, Jupiter Capitolinus, Juno, and Minerva ; in another, Apollo Palatinus, Latona, and Diana ; in
another, Hercules and the Muses; in another, Venus and Cupid ; in
another, Castor and Pollux ; in another, Æsculapius and Apollo ; in an other, the Sun and Moon ; in another, Mars and Venus ; in another, Pan and Ceres.
Temples were built after that manner which they thought most agree
able to the gods to whom they designed they should be dedicated ; for as trees, birds, and other animals, were thought sacred to peculiar deities, so almost every god had a form of building peculiar to himself, and which
they thought more acceptable to him than any other. For instance , the
Doric pillars were sacred to Jupiter, Mars, and Hercules ; the Ionic to Bacchus, Apollo, and Diana ; the Corinthian to Vesta the Virgin . I dený not but that sometimes all these were made use of in the same tem
ple : but this was either in those temples which were sacred to more gods than one, or to some of those gods who were thought to preside over several
things; for the ancients, believing that the world was governed by divine providence, ascribed the management of every particular affair to this or that deity ; thus Mars was thought to preside over war , Venus over love :
and to some of their gods they assigned the care over several things ; so Mercury was the god merchants, orators, and thieves ; Minerva was the goddess of warriors, scholars, and artificers, &c.; and therefore it is no
wonder that in some of the temples dedicated to her there were three rows of pillars, the first of the Dorie, the second of the Corinthian , and the third of the Ionic order.
As to the places of temples, it being the common opinion that some of
the gods delighted in woods, others in mountains, others in valleys, others in fields, others in rivers or fountains; it was customary to dedicate the temples in places most agreeable to the temper of the deities who should inhabit them. The people hoped for fruitful seasons, and all sorts of
prosperity, wherever the temples stood . Hence Libanius makes heavy complaints against the Christians, who demolished the pagan temples,
whereby, as he imagined, the fields became unfruitful, the temples being the very life of the fields; and the husbandmen , whose only confidence for themselves, their wives, their children , their corn , their cattle, their
plantations, was placed in temples, were miserably disappointed of their expectations. The temples in the country were generally surrounded
with groves sacred to the tutelar deity of the place, where, before the in vention of temples, the gods were worshipped ; but when these could not be had, as in cities and large towns, they were built amongst, and even adjoining to , the common houses; only the Tanagræans thought this inconsistent with the reverence due to those holy mansions of the gods,

and therefore took care to have their temples founded in places free from the noise and hurry of business : for which Pausanias ? commends them . Wherever they stood , if the situation of the place would permit, it was contrived , that the windows being open, they might receive the rays of
the rising sun. The frontispiece was placed towards the west, and the altars and statues towards the other end, that so those who came to wor
ship , might have their faces towards them ; because it was an ancient custom among the heathens, to worship with their faces towards the east.
This is affirmed by Clemens of Alexandria,3 and Hyginus the freedman of Augustus Cæsar,4 to have been the most ancient situation of temples, and that the placing the front of temples towards the east was only a
device of later ages. Nevertheless the way of building temples towards the east, so as the doors being opened should receive the rising sun, was very ancient, and in later ages almost universal: almost all the temples were then so contrived, that the entrance and statues should look towards
the east, and they who paid their devotion towards the west ;' as we are
expressly told by Porphyry . Thus the eastern nations commonly built their temples, as appears from the temple of the Syrian goddess in Lucian ,
the temple at Memphis, built by Psammitichus king of Egypt, in Dio dorus the Sicilian, that of Vulcan, erected by another Egyptian king, in
the second book of Herodotus, and the temple at Jerusalem . ) If the temples were built by the side of a river, they were to look towards the
banks of it ;& if near the highway, they were to be so ordered that travel
lers might have a fair prospect of them , and pay their devotions to the god as they passed by .
Temples were divided into two parts, the sacred and profane; the latter
they called το έξω περιρραντήριον, the other το έσω. Now this περιρραντήριον was a vessel, usually of stone or brass, filled with holy water, with which all those that were admitted to the sacrifices were besprinkled, and beyond
which it was not lawful for any one that was Báßnaos, or profane, to pass. Some say it was placed in the entrance of the " Aduroy, which was the
inmost recess of the temple, into which none entered but the priests,
called also 'Ανάκτορον, says Pollux ; whence βέβηλος τόπος 1s by Phavorinus said to be so called in opposition to this adytum . But Casaubon 10 tells us,
that the #spopportugoy was placed at the door of the temple ; and this
opinion seems the most probable , because all persons that were ébéßnhos, or unpolluted , were permitted to pass beyond it, which they could not
have done had it been placed at the entrance of the adytum. The word Enxos is variously used . Ammonius 11 and Pollux 12 say, that
it properly signifies a temple dedicated to a hero, or demigod . By Hesy
chius and Suidas it is expounded, ó- lvdórsgos TómOS TOū isgrū, the inner part of the temple ; or that it should seem to have been the same with ãàutov.

The word , in its most proper acceptation, is used for a sheepfold ; and
because the images of the gods were, according to most ancient custom , placed in the middle of the temple, and close railed in on every side, this
place, as some are of opinion , from the likeness it has to a sheepfold, was called onxos, which in time came to signify the whole temple, a part being put for the whole. In the same manner was fotia, that is, the fire- place, or hearth, used for the whole house.
There was a place belonging to temples, termed in Greek ágxsior, by some translated summum templum , which was a repository or treasury , both for the service of the church, and others who desired to secure money
or other things there, as was done by Xenophon , who committed his trea sure to the custody of the priest of Diana at Ephesus. Hence those epi
thets are given it by Pollux, μεγαλόπλουτον, πολύχρυσον, αρχαιόπλουτον, &c.
The old scholia upon Sophocles, and out of them Phavorinus, thus
describe the temples : Naòs , and 'Ispov, or the whole edifice, in which are
contained, Bwuos, the altar, on which they offered their oblations; IIgóvaov, the porch , in which usually stood an altar, or image ; and Téusvos, the
place upon which the image of the chief god was erected. As among the most ancient Egyptians, ázóxvou moi sjovy, the temples were without statues, if Lucian may be credited, so also the Greeks wor
shipped their gods without any visible representation , till the time of Cecrops, the founder of Athens, who, according to Eusebius' account,
lived about the age of Moses. The most ancient representations of the
gods were exceedingly rude, and agreeable to the ignorance of those ages. The Scythians worshipped a sort of sword called áxiváxns the Arabians a stone ; the Persians a river.4
The idol was at first commonly a rude stock, whence it is called savis by St Clemens of Alexandria . Such a one was that of Juno Samia ,
which was afterwards, in the magistracy of Procles, turned into a statue . Sometimes it was a stone, Pausanias tells us, that in Achaia there were
kept, very religiously, thirty square stones, on which were engraven the names of so many gods, but without any picture or effigies. In another place, he speaks of a very ancient statue of Venus at Delos, which instead of feet had only a square stone. No sort of idol was more common than that of oblong stones erected, and thence termed ríoves, pillars. Several
examples are mentioned by the forementioned Clemens, as also by Euse bius ? In the eastern countries these sorts of representations seem to have
been exceedingly frequent. In some parts of Egypt, they were to be seen on each side of the highways.S In the temple of Heliogabalus, that is,
the sun, in Syria, there was one pretended to have fallen down from hea ven.9 Such a stone is feigned by the poets to have been swallowed by

Saturn , instead of his son Jupiter: hence the worship paid to them . Others rather derive it from the appointment of Uranus, the first god, and father of Saturn . One thing is remarkable, both in these stones,
and others of different figures, as particularly in the square stone which
represented the god Mars at Petra in Arabia , that their colours were most commonly black ,” which seems to have been thought in those times the
more solemn and becoming colour of things dedicated to religious uses . They were called βαιτύλια , or βαιτύλοι, which name seems to be derived from the Phoenician language, wherein bethel signifies the house of God .
Some are of opinion, that their true origin is to be derived from the pillar of stone which the patriarch Jacob erected at Bethel. * Most of the bar barous nations worshipped mountains, or rude stocks of trees, or unformed stones , 5 Thus Tacitus affirms, that in Germany the images of the gods
consisted è stipitibus rudibus et impolito robore, of rude trunks and unpolished oak ." Lucan also describes the gods of Massilia, as old
images of forms misshapen , rude, and unknowing of the artist's hand .' And Themistius ? has told us, that all the Grecian images till Dædalus'
time were unformed : he it was that first made two separate feet; whereas before they were but one piece ; whence it was reported , says Palæphatus, that Dædalus formed moving and walking statues. At first, therefore,
they were only called góæva , dià Tò Fožiioboes, because they were shaven : and this word properly denotes an idol that is itsombros, shaven out of
wood or stone, says Hesychius.9 In after ages, when the art of graving and carving was invented, they changed the rude lumps into figures resembling living creatures, generally men ; and then an image was called
Bpiras, dià cò Bootão torxévas, because it was like a man.10 Nevertheless, in more refined ages, such of the unformed images as were preserved,
were reverenced for their antiquity, and preferred to the most curious pieces of modern art.11

and last of all, gold, silver, brass, and all other metals, were put to this
The forms and postures of the statues are uncertain , being com monly made in imitation of the poetical descriptions of the gods, especially those in Homer, whose authority was most sacred . The place of the images was in the middle of the temple , where they stood on pedestals raised above the height of the altar, and were enclosed
with rails ; whence this place was called onrós. That the images were placed thus, Virgil bears witness, when he says, Tumforibus dive, media testudine templi. Then at the chancel door, where Juno stands.
Where, by the fores divæ, is to be understood the entrance of the anxós.
Another of the poets, where he talks of erecting a temple, says, In medio mihi Cæsar erit. I'll Cæsar's statue in the midst erect.
Bwpàs among the Greeks, is a word of larger extent than altare among
the Latins ; for this, in its proper signification, only denotes the place on which they sacrificed to the celestial gods, being raised up high from the
ground, and therefore called Altare, ab altitudine, ' from its height;' but Bespòs is used not only to signify this high altar, but those lower ones called in Latin ara . These altars differed according to the diversity of the gods
to whom they were consecrated ; for the Osoà oùgávia , or celestial gods, had their altars raised up a great height from the ground, insomuch that Pau sanjas 1 tells us, the altar of Olympian Jupiter was almost twenty -two feet high. Porphyry makes no distinction betwixt these and the altars of the
Ocol Xbónov, or terrestrial gods. But though they are both signified by the same word, yet they seem not to have been of equal height. To the heroes they sacrificed upon altars close to the ground, which the Greeks called ioxágos, being only one step high . The subterranean , or infernal gods, called ' TFoxbóvia , had , instead of altars, little ditches or trenches dug
or ploughed up for that purpose ; these the Greeks called aéxzos and Bélgoi. Porphyry adds a fifth, telling us that the nymphs, and such like deities, in
stead of altars, had örtga or caves, where religious worship was paid to them ; δια τα εν άντρους καταλειβόμενα ύδατα, ών αι Ναΐαδες προσήκασι Núppan, by reason of the waters which are distilled into the caverns, and whereof the nymphs called Naiades are presidents.
The altars were always lower than the statues of the gods. They were made commonly of earth heaped together ; sometimes of ashes, as was that
of Olympian Jupiter, beforementioned , which Pausanias 3 says was made of the ashes of burnt sacrifices. Another of ashes was dedicated at Thebes
to Apollo, who had hence the name of Szédos, as we learn from the same author. Lastly, any other durable materials ; as horn in the famous altar
at Delos ; brick in one mentioned by Pausanias :* but chiefly and most
commonly stones. Before temples were in use , altars were sometimes

erected in groves, sometimes in other places ; and Eustathius upon the second Iliad tells us, that they were often erected in the highways, for the convenience of travellers. The terrestrial gods had their altars in low
places, but the celestial were worshipped on the tops of mountains. As for want of temples, they built their altars in the open air ; so for want of
altars, they anciently used to sacrifice upon the bare ground, and some times upon a turf of green earth ; which is called cespes vivus, ' a living turf,' by Horace. The sacrifices offered without altars were termed

coins of the Persian kings, and of Alexander and his successors,
informed by Clemens ' of Alexandria, that Alexander sometimes wore horns, as a token of his divine extraction . And the Phoenician accounts relate, that Astarte, one of the most ancient Phoenician queens, used to
wear upon her head bulls' horns, ws Becordsías Fagkonpon, as an ensign of royalty .
It was customary to engrave upon altars the name, or proper ensign or character of the deity, to whom they belonged. This we find done to the Athenian altar upon which St Paul observed this inseription, ' Ayvártu sõ , To the unknown God. Sometimes the occasion of the dedication,
with other circumstances, was expressed. Thus in the Roman altar, upon which was found this inscription : C. JULIUS ANICETUS SOLI DIVINO SUSCEPTO VOTO ANIMO LUBENS D. D.
“ Caius Julius Anicetus willingly dedicates this altar to the divine sun,
in performance of a vow .” Some altars were furugos, designed for sacrifices made by fire : others, ärugons,without fire, and evaluartos, without blood ; upon which neither fire nor blood could lawfully be placed , but only cakes, fruits of the earth, and inanimate things. An example of these altars we find in the follow ing verse of Orpheus:

Another near the altar of horn at Delos, sacred to Apollo Genitor, upon
which Pythagoras, who thought it unlawful to put animals to death, used to sacrifice , is mentioned by Diogenes Laërtius. Another dedicated to
Jupiter ÜFatos, the Supreme, in the time and by the order of Cecrops king of Athens, we find in Pausanias. Lastly, Paphian Venus had an altar which was esciuntos, free from blood, it being unlawful to offer
animals upon it : but not drugos, void of fire ; for the goddess was wor shipped solis precibus et igne puro, only with prayers , and pure fire ,' as Tacitus affirms,
The manner of consecrating altars and images was the same, and is thus described by the scholiast upon Aristophanes :- a woman dressed in a garment of divers colours brought upon her head a pot of sodden pulse, as
beans, peas , or the like, which they gratefully offered to the gods, in remembrance of their ancient diet. But this custom seems to have been
more especially practised at the consecration of the ' Egucē, ar statues of Mercury , and then only by the poorer sort, as the comedian intimates,
when he speaks of the consecration of another image in his play entitled Peace : 5

Where the scholiast observes, that sometimes their consecrations were
more expensive, being performed with more sumptuous offerings and ceremonies. But these, like the other parts of divine worship, were varied according to the condition of the worshippers, and the nature or humour of the deities. To give one instance: Athenæus in the ninth book of his Deipnosophists tells us, that Jupiter Ctesia's statue was consecrated in this manner : they took a new vessel with two ears, upon each of which
they bound a chaplet of white wool, and another of yellow upon the fore part of it, and covered the vessel; then they poured out before it a libation called ambrosia, which was a mixture of water, honey, and all sorts of fruit. The truth of the matter is this: the primitive Greeks, according
to their usual frugality, consecrated the statues of the gods,with very little expense . Afterwards, when they increased in wealth, and fell into a more
sumptuous way of living, more pompous and costly ceremonies were by
degrees introduced in religious worship. Only the poorer sort, out of
necessity, still adhered to the ancient customs; especially when the meaner sort of statues, such as were those of Mercury , which stood in the
public streets, were to be dedicated . In former ages, even the images and altars of Jupiter were consecrated in the same manner with those of Mercury. This is plain, from the verses cited by the scholiast of Aristo
phanes, out of the Danaïdes of that poet :

But the most usual manner of consecration was performed by putting a crown upon them, anointing them with oil, and then offering prayers and
oblations to them . Sometimes they added an execration against all that should presume to profane them , and inscribed upon them the name of the
deity, and the cause of their dedication. In this manner the Spartan vir
gins, in Theocritus' eighteenth Idyllium, promise to consecrate a tree to Helena : for it was customary to dedicate trees, or plants, after the same
manner with altars and statues. Ovid likewise, in the eighth book of his Metamorphoses, speaks of adorning them with ribands.
The act of consecration chiefly consisted in the unction, which was a
ceremony derived from the most primitive antiquity. The sacred taber nacle, with all the vessels and utensils, as also the altar and the priests themselves, were consecrated in this manner by Moses, at the divine command . It is well known that the Jewish kings and prophets were
admitted to their several offices by unction. The patriarch Jacob by the same rite consecrated the altars which he made use of ;? in doing which,
it is more probable that he followed the tradition of his forefathers, than that he was the author of this custom . The same, or something like it,
was also continued down to the times of Christianity. We find that in
Theodoret's time, superstitious women anointed the balisters, xiyxaídas, of the churches, and the repositories of martyrs.3 And in the primitive ages of the church , oil was used upon some other occasions..

as
we

It

to
have
been
a

cus
tom
,
which
prevailed
not
only
in
Europe
,
but
over
all
the
eastern
countries
,
to
attribute
a
sort
of
religion
to

Hence,
among

precepts
,
whereby
the

kept
from
the
imitation
of

,
this
was
one
:

thou

not

of

.'
This
practice
is
thought
to
have
been
intro
duced
into
Greece
from
Phoenicia
by
Cadmus
.
Some
are
of
opinion
,
that

Several
causes
are
assigned
why
groves
came
into
so
general
request
.
As, first, the pleasantness of such places was apt to allure the people, and to beget in them a love for the religious worship which was paid there ;
especially in hot countries, where nothing is more delightful and refresh ing than cool shades ; for which cause the sacred groves consisted of tall and beautiful trees, rather than such as yielded fruit. Hence Cyril ex

äragiu Góra , trees which afford no fruit for human use, tágysws zágir, merely for the sake of pleasure . Thus one of the temples of Diana is described by Herodotus,4 to stand within a grove dovdgów psylotwr, of the largest trees . And the way to Mercury's temple was set on both sides
with dévèpsa ougovopeńxsa , trees reaching up to heaven , as we are told by the same historian . The same is farther confirmed by the descriptions of
groves which remain in the ancient poets. Secondly , the solitude of groves was thought very fit to create a religi ous awe and reverence in the minds of the people . Thus we are told by Pliny , that in groves, ipsa silentia adoramus,' thevery silence of the place becomes the object of our adoration ,5' Seneca also observes, that when we
come into such places, illa proceritas sylvæ , et secretum loci, et admiratio umbre , fidem numinis facit, “ the height of the trees, the solitude and secrecy of the place, and the horror which the shade strikes into us, does
possess us with an opinion that some deity inhabits there. ' It may not be
impertinent to add one testimony more from Ovid, who speaks thus :? Lucus Aventinosuberal niger ilicis umbra, A darksome grove of oak was spread out near,
Quo possis viso dicere, Numen inest. Whose gloom impressive told, “ A God dwells here."
Thirdly, some are of opinion that groves derived their religion from the

primitive ages of men , who lived in such places before the building of houses . Thus Tacitus 1 reports of the ancient Germans, that they had no other defence for their infants against wild beasts or the weather, than what
was afforded ramorun nexu, by boughs of trees compacted together. All other nations lived at first in the same manner ; which was derived from
paradise, the seat of the first parents of mankind. It is not unworthy of observation , that most of the ceremonies used in religion were at first taken from the customs of human life. Afterwards the manners and customs
of men changed , but the same rites still were preserved in religious wor
ship , which it was thought a sort of irreverence to alter. Thus, from the houses of men were derived the temples and habitations of the gods ; which were not built in the most primitive ages, as hath been before observed, men having not then invented the art of making houses. The altars
served instead of tables, and the sacrifices were the entertainments of the gods. It is farther observable, that the several sorts of things offered in sacrifice were taken from their use in human food . The animals most
commonly eaten by men were made victims to the gods: and those ages,
which are reported to have lived only on the fruits of the earth, are like wise said to have refrained from sacrificing animals ; which will farther appear in the fourth chapter of this book .?
In latter ages, when cities began to be filled with people, and men to delight in magnificent edifices and costly ornaments, more than the coun try and primitive way of living, groves by degrees came into disuse. Yet
such of the groves as remained from former times were still held in great veneration , and reverenced the more for the sake of their antiquity . As in the early times it was accounted an act of sacrilege to cut down
any
the

genius of that poet, but quite contrary to the manners of the times he
describes. His words are these : 1
Congerite silvas ; templa supplicibus tuis Injecta fagrent; conjugem et totam gregem Consumat unus igne subjecto rogus. There are several examples of the same custom in Plautus. When
Tranio, the slave of Theuropides, had fled to a sanctuary, his master
threatens him thus :2 Jam jubebo ignem at sarmenta, carnufer, circumdari.
In another place of that author, Labrax, in the same manner, bespeaks his
damsels, who had betaken themselves to the protection of Venus :3
Volcanum adducam , is Veneris est adversarius.
It being a direct act of sacrilege to take away suppliants from the sanctu ary whither they had fled for protection, this method was used to constrain them to leave it, as it were of themselves, and by their own consent. Nevertheless, this evasion of the sacred privileges was not thought free from impiety. Whence the forementioned words of Hermione are thus
answered by Andromache in Euripides :4 Συ δ' ούν κάταιθο· ιοί γαρ είσονται τάδε. Then burn me ; but these things the gods will see.

The wild beast is secured by the rocks, and slaves by the altars of the gods. Nevertheless it is most certain , to use the words of Servius,6 non fuisse asylum in omnibus templis, nisi quibus consecrationis lege concessum est :
' that all temples were not sanctuaries, but only such as received that privi lege from the manner of their consecration .' Whence, at the dedication
of such places, particular mention is often made by authors, that they were appointed to be sanctuaries ; which would have been needless, if all tem
ples had been invested with that privilege. The same farther appears from this, that some of the asyla were free for all men, others appropri
ated to certain persons, or crimes. Thus, the temple of Diana at Ephe sus, was a refuge for debtors ; the tomb or temple of Theseus, was a sanctuary for slaves, and all those of mean condition , that fled from the
severities and hard usages of their masters, and men in power ; because Theseus was an assister and protector of the distressed, and never rejected the petitions of the afflicted , who fled to him for succour and defence, as
Plutarch reports .? Nor was this honour only granted to the gods, but also
to the statues or monuments of princes, and other great persons. So the

sepulchre of Achilles on the Sigean shore, was, in after ages, made an asylum ; and Ajax had the like honour paid his tomb on the Rhoetean . The first asylum , some say , was built at Athens by the Heraclidæ , and was a refuge for those who fled from the oppression of their fathers ; others
will have this to be a sanctuary for all sorts of suppliants. Others affirm ,
that the first was erected at the building of Thebes by Cadmus, where the privilege of sanctuary was granted to all sorts of criminals ; and in imita
tion of these, they say, the asylum at Rome was opened by Romulus, This is certain , that sanctuaries were common in the heroical times.
Hence Troy being taken, Priamus fled for protection to the altar of Jupi ter Herceus, as we are informed by Pausanias.3 Virgil adds farther, that
he was accompanied by his wife Hecuba, and his children.4 And Polyx
ena, who was to be sacrificed to appease Achilles' ghost, is thus advised by one in Euripides :: 'Αλλ Τθι πρός ναούς , Εθι προς βωμόνς Go to the temples, to the altars go.
The sacredness of these places was held entire till the reign of Tiberius
Cæsar, who, upon consideration of the many inconveniences which must necessarily be the effect of tolerating so many villains as were always har boured in them, dissolved them all, preserving only to Juno Samia , and
one of Æsculapius' temples, their ancient privileges. Suetonius indeed reports,6 that he did abolere jus moremque asylorum , que usquam erant,
abolish the privileges and customs of asyla in all parts of the world . But from Tacitus, who has more exactly reported this matter, we learn , that
the privileges of sanctuaries were not then wholly taken away , but only regulated and reformed ,?
Before the conclusion of this chapter, it will not be improper to mention the fields dedicated to religious uses . These were called Τεμένη. Τίμι
yas is interpreted by the scholiast upon Homer 8 to be isgày xwgion, cowgio pévor Jam xata pigesny is ñ gwž• a sacred portion of land set apart in honour of some god or hero. Several of these places are mentioned by Homer, Pausanias, and other authors. Sometimes their product was carefully
gathered in, and reserved for the maintenance of the priests, or other
religious purposes. For, as hath been already observed, it was customary to pay the same offices to the gods which men stand in need of. The
temples were their houses, sacrifices their food, altars their tables, images
represented their persons, and portions of land were also set apart for the maintenance of their families. The same respect was paid to kings, and
men who had done eminent service for their country. Thus Tarquinius Superbus had a portion of ground in the Campus Martius at Rome. King Latinus' field is mentioned by Virgil :10

CHAP. III.
OF THE GRECIAN PRIESTS, AND THEIR OFFICES.
It has been the custom of all nations to pay a peculiar honour to their priests; which was partly done out of respect to the gods, whom they re presented ; and partly, as Plutarch in his Morals tells us, because they did not pray for a blessing upon themselves, their own families and friends
only, but on whole communities, on the whole state of mankind . They were accounted mediators between gods and mer , being obliged to offer
the sacrifices and prayers of the people to their gods, as will farther appear
in the following chapter ; and on the other side igunveutaì rupà IsWv årbgu F015, deputed by the gods to be their interpreters to men , to instruct them how to pray for themselves, what it was most expedient to ask , what sacri
fices, what vows, what gifts, would be most acceptable to the gods: and, in short, to teach them all the ceremonies used in the divine worship , as Plato informs us.' On this account the priests were honoured with the
next places to their kings and chief magistrates, and in many places wore the same habit. In most of the Grecian cities, and particularly at Athens, as we are informed by Plato, and several others, the care of divine wor
ship was committed to the chief magistrates; and these were often conse crated to the priesthood . Thus Anius, in Virgil, was king of Delos, and

In Egypt the kings were all priests ;2 and if anyone who was not of the royal family usurped the kingdom, he was obliged to be consecrated to the priesthood before he was permitted to govern . In some places of Greece
αντίρροπον ήν το της ιερωσύνης αξίωμα προς το της βασιλείας the dignity of priests was equal to that of kings, as we are assured by Plutarch.3 At Sparta , the kings immediately after their promotion , took upon them the two priesthoods of the enly and the Lacedæmonian Jupiter,4 which was rather esteemed an accession to their honour, than any diminution of it. All the public sacrifices for the safety of the commonwealth were offered by them only ; it being the common opinion , that the gods were
more ready to hear the prayers of them than other men. Neither was this a privilege peculiar to royal priests, but common to all others, even in the most ancient times ; they being all accounted the immediate ministers of the gods, and by them commissioned to dispense their favours to mankind. Hence, though at other times it was not unlawful for other men to offer sacrifices, yet when any public calamity was to be averted, or any great,
and uncommon blessing to be obtained , they had recourse to some of those who were consecrated to the office of priesthood. Thus the pestilence could not be removed from the Grecian army by any prayers or sacrifices,

and the same is frequently done in other places by the heroes, princes, or masters of the family ; it being customary for the most honourable person in the company to perform the religious rites. The same method was observed by the patriarchs in the Holy Scriptures, where we find oblations made by Cain, Abel, Noah , Abraham , Job, Jacob , and others, till the
timeof Aaron's consecration to the priesthood, after which it was reputed
an act of sacrilege for private persons to intermeddle with any of the sacred rites.
Some of the priests obtained their office and dignity by inheritance.
This was the constant method in Egypt, amongst the Jews, the sacred
families at Athens, and in many other places. Some were appointed by lots, others by the designation of the princes, and others by popular elec tions. That this last method was very ancient, appears from Homer ,2
where he speaks of Theano's being appointed priestess of Minerva by the Trojans: Την γας Τρώες έθηκαν Αθηναίης ιέρειαν.
Hér the Trojans appointed to be priestess of Minerva . Where Eustathius
observes , that she was ούτε κληρωτή, ούτε εκ γένους , ούτε ενός ψήφω, αλλ' ήν, ως παλαιοί φασι, το πλήθος είλετο neither appointed by lots , mor by right of inheritance, nor by the designation of a single person , but, as the ancients
say, elected by the people. By, which words he describes the several ways of appointing priests, which were used by the ancient Greeks. It was required, that whoever was admitted to this office, should be
sound and perfect in all his members, it being thought a dishonour to the gods to be served by any one who was lame, maimed, or any other way imperfect; and therefore at Athens, before their consecration, it was exa mined whether they were åpensīs, that is, perfect and entire, neither hav ing any defect nor any thing superfluous . In the same manner, it is commanded by one of the Jewish laws, which in many things agree with those of Athens, that no man of the seed of Aaron that had a blemish, shall come nigh unto the altar.4
Nor ought they to be perfect in body only, but upright in mind ; nothing ought to approach the gods but what is pure and uncorrupt ; therefore the
priests lived temperately and chastely , abstaining even from those plea sures which were allowable to other men ; insomuch that Euripides tells us, that in Crete the prophets of Jupiter did not only deny themselves the use of flesh meat, but forbore to eat any thing that was boiled. Some were so rigid observers of the rules of chastity , that like the priests of the Mother of the gods at Samos, they dismembered themselves. The hiero phantæ at Athens, after their admission , enfeebled themselves by a draught of the juice of hemlock : in short, it was very customary for those that
attended on the more sacred and mysterious rites, by using certain herbs and medicaments, to unman themselves that they might worship the

gods with greater chastity and purity . They also generally retired from the world , to the end, that being free from business and cares, they might have the more leisure to attend on the service of the gods, and wholly
devote themselves to piety, and the exercise of religion. One of the herbs commonly made use of by them was the agnus castus, in Greek aúyos, or čyros , so called from being ayovos, an enemy to generation ; this they were
wont to strew under the bedclothes, believing that it had a certain natural virtue, whereby it was able to preserve their chastity, as Eustathius," be sides many others, hath observed . But though most of them were obliged to strict chastity and temperance, and some to practise these severities upon themselves, yet others were allowed to marry ; and Eustathius 2 tells
us that it was but an institution of later ages, that the priestesses should be virgins ; to confirm which, Homer gives us an instance in Theano, who
was priestess of Minerva, and wife of Antenor the Trojan :
-θιανά καλλιπάρφος At length subdued, Theano, as they came, Κισσηίς, Βλοχος 'Αντήνορος ιπποδάμοιο From Cisseus sprung, Antenor's lovely spouse, Τήν γάρ Τρώες Eθηκαν 'Αθηναίης Σερειαν.3 And priestess by the generalvoice, threw wide
The sacred heights The temple doors.
In Homer's first Iliad mention is made of Chryseis, the daughter of Chry
ses, Apollo's priest ; and in the fifth Iliad , Dares, the priest of Vulcan, is said to have two sons. Nevertheless, second marriages were not reputed cre
ditable . Hence Dido in Virgil, speaking of being married to Æneas after the death of a former husband, calls it culpa, ' a fault :"? Huic uni forsan potui succumbere culpæ .
Where Servius has made this remark , quòd antiqui, à sacerdotio repelle bant bis nuptas: that the ancients used to exclude from the priesthood those who had been twice married .' By which words it is implied, that in
the latter ages such persons were admitted to this office. In some places, to have several husbands, or several lovers, was a necessary qualification for the priestess. Alia sacra coronat univira , alia multivira , et magna religione conquiritur, quæ plura possit adulteria numerare , saith Minu
tius Felix. This we find reported concerning the priestesses in Lydia by Herodotus , and those in Armenia by Strabo.'
At Athens all the priests and priestesses, with the sacred families, and all others who were entrusted with the care of religion, were obliged to give account before certain officers how they had discharged their several functions,
In small cities, all the sacred offices were commonly executed by one
person , who both offered sacrifices, had the care of the temple, collected
the revenues belonging to it, and had the management of other things, which any way related to the worship of the gods. But where the wor shippers were numerous, and by consequence the religious services too
burdensome for one priest, several priests were appointed, and other officers

not only every god had a different order of priests consecrated to him , but
even the priests of the same gods were very different, according to the diversity of place, and other circumstances. I shall not therefore trouble the reader with an account of the particular priests belonging to every
deity in the many cities of Greece, which would be both unpleasant and not very useful, but only briefly mention the general orders, and offices of
them . First, in every place they seem to have had an ' Açxiegwoúrns, or high -priest, whose office it was to superintend over the rest, and execute the more sacred rites and mysteries of religion . Amongst the Opuntians , there were two chief- priests, one of which belonged to the chief and celes tial gods, the other to the Aaipones, or demigods. At Athens they had a
great many, every god almost having a chief-priest that presided over the rest ; as the Dadouchus over the priests of Hercules, and the Stephano
phorus over those of Pallas. The Delphians had five chief- priests, who helped to perform the holy rites with the prophets, and had the chief man agement of all parts of divine worship ; these were called 101, i.e. holy , and the chief of them that presided at sacrifices, dowthg, i. e. the purifier,
one that makes holy ; and another that had the care of the oracle, called
åpning, which is a surname of Apollo, given him by Homer, and signifies one that gives oracles .
Another holy order was that of the parasiti, which word , says Clearchus
the Solensian, one of Aristotle's scholars, in its first acceptation signified Tòy torov, a man quick and expeditious, but was afterwards taken for a table- companion : though Polemon is of opinion that this was its ancient
signification, and that they were so called , because they were allowed part of the sacrifices together with the priest, as is evident from an inscription on a pillar in the Anaceum : TOIN AE BOOIN TOIN HIEMONOIN TOIN EEAIPOTMENOIN TO MEN TPITON MEPOX ΕΙΣ ΤΟΝ ΑΓΩΝΑ ΤΑ ΔΕ ΔΥΟ ΜΕΡΗ ΤΟ ΜΕΝ ΕΤΕΡΟΝ ΤΩ ΙΕΡΕΙ ΤΟ ΔΕ ΤΟΙΣ ΠΑΡΑΣΙΤΟΙΣ ..
That of the oxen , one part should be reserved for the games , and of the other two, one should be given to the priests, another to the parasiti. It was at first an office of great honour; for by the ancient law , the parasiti were reckoned among the chief magistrates.

house, where they kept these first - fruits, was called sogaritmov . Diodorus the Sinopensian in Athenæus tells us, that in every village of the Athe
nians, they maintained at the public charge certain parasiti in honour of Hercules ; but afterwards, to ease the commonwealth of this burden, the magistrates obliged some of the wealthier sort to take them to their own
tables, and entertain them at their own cost ; whence this word seems in
later ages to have signified a trencher -friend, a flatterer, or one that, for the sake of a dinner, conforms himself to every man's humour. Thus in
deed Casaubon interprets that passage ; but the meaning of it seems rather to be this : that whereas in former times, Hercules had his parasiti, the rich men of later ages, in imitation of that hero, chose likewise their parasiti, though not yagicoToTO , such as Hercules used to have, but tous
nołaxsúery durapivous, such as would flatter them most. The rhguxss also, or public criers, assisted at sacrifices, and seem to
have had the same office with the popæ and victimarii among the Latins ; for in Athenæus , one Clidemnus tells us, they were instead of páraigon and Boudurai, cooks and butchers ; and adds, that a long time the crier's
office was to kill the offering, prepare things necessary for the sacrifices, and to serve instead of a cupbearer at the feast; he also tells us, that the ministering of sacrifices did of old belong to the criers. The same is confirmed by Eustathius on this verse of Homer :: Κήρυκος δ 'ανά άστυ θεών ιερών εκατόμβην Along the streets the sacred hecatomb Hyov.

næus 1 tells us, were the first that taught men to boil their victuals, as the
flesh of sheep and oxen , which before they devoured raw . They were had
in great honour at Athens, insomuch , that Athenæus endeavours to prove that the trade of a cook was a creditable calling, from the respect paid to
these ceryces, who were cooks at sacrifices, and likewise seem to have
performed those other holy offices, which belonged to the rúgures in other places. Diodorus Siculus ? resembles them to the Egyptian pastophori,
and thinks they had their origin from them ; indeed some parts of their office were much alike, for both of them killed the victim, and attended on the sacrificers,
Newxógos, called by Nicander Sexógoi,3 so named from rogsīv, which signifies to keep neat, and clean, or to adorn : for it was their duty to adorn the temples, and look after the furniture of them ; but they sub mitted not to such mean offices as the sweeping of them , as Suidas * would have it ; but herein he contradicts Euripides, who brings in Ion, the
vewrógos, or edituus of Apollo, telling Mercury that he swept the temple
with a besom of laurel. There were also væopóranes, whose charge it was to take care of the holy utensils, and see that nothing was wanting, and to repair what went to decay, says Aristotle . Sometimes the parasiti are said to have been entrusted with the reparation of temples ; and there
was a law enacted at Athens, that whatever they expended this way should be repaid them. There were also other priests, one of which Aristophanes ' calls agórs aps, which is a general name for any servant, and therefore to restrain it, he adds Isoő, calling him spórodo5 J 07. These were priests always
waiting on the gods, whose prayers the people desired at sacrifices, at which they seem to have performed some other rites distinct from those
which belonged to the ceryces : their share in the sacrifices was the skin and feet ; the tongues were the fees of the ceryces. Indeed all that served the gods were maintained by the sacrifices and other holy offerings. To
which there is an allusion in Aristophanes, where Cario thus speaks to the priest :

OF THE GRECIAN SACRIFICES, SACRED PRESENTS , AND TITHES.
DIDYMUS, in his Annotations upon Pindar,2 reports, that one Melisseus,
a king of Crete, was the first that offered sacrifice to the gods, and invented religious rites and ceremonies, and that Amalthea and Melissa, who nursed Jupiter, and fed him with goat's milk and honey, were his daugh ters. Others relate, that Phoroneus, some, that Merops, was the first who
erected altars and temples, and offered sacrifices . And others will have
the use of inapocà Jurías, propitiatory sacrifices, to have been first begun by Chiron the centaur ." But passing by these and the like fabulous nar rations, I shall endeavour to describe the customs in use amongst the ancient Greeks at their solemn sacrifices. In doing which, I shall treat, 1. Of the occasion and end of them ; 2. Of their matter ; 3. Of the pre
parations required before them, with all the ornaments both of the sacri fiees, victims, and altars ; 4. Of the sacred rites used at and after their celebration .
As to the causes and occasions of them , they seem to have been chiefly four: For sacrifices were,
1. Eixtaia, or xagiotúgia , vows, or free-will offerings ; such were those promised to the gods before, and paid after a victory ; as also the first
fruits offered by husbandmen after harvest, being grateful acknowledgments to the gods, by whose blessing they had received a plentiful reward for their labour and toil in tilling the ground. These are by Suidas called θυσίαι δωροφορικαί , because they were free gifts ; and αποπληστικαί, be cause thereby they fulfilled some vow made to the gods; both whieh being effects of gratitude, I have reduced under one head . It may not be improper here to correct the mistake of Saubertus, who takes súrtaia for aitntixà, petitionarg sacrifices ; whereas, the proper meaning of súrreios is, according to Hesychius, sò xar' Luxeho úrodidóusvov, that which is dis charged by a vow.

2. ' Ilarrirà, or dicadantixà, propitiatory offerings, to avert the anger of some offended deity. Such were all the sacrifices used in expiations. 3. Aipatixà, petitionary sacrifices, for success in any enterprise. So religious were the heathens, that they would not undertake any thing of moment, without having first asked the advice, and implored the assistance
of the gods, by sacrifices and presents. 4. Tà árò partiías, such as were imposed and commanded by an oracle
or prophet. Some others have been added, which I have purposely omitted, as reducible to some of these four. I come now, in the second place, to treat of the matter of their obla
tions. In the most ancient sacrifices, there were neither living creatures, nor any thing costly or magnificent ; no myrrh , or frankincense, or other perfumes, were made use of; but instead of them all, herbs and plants, plucked up by the roots, were burnt whole, with their leaves and fruit,
before the gods, and this was thought a very acceptable oblation . The like customs prevailed in most other nations, and particularly amongst the primitive Italians, of whose sacrifices Ovid has left us the following
description :
Ante, deos homini quod conciliare valeret, In former times the gods were cheaply pleasid,
Far erat, et puri lucida mica salis. A little corn and salt their wrath appeas'd ;
Nondum pertulerat lacrymatas cortice myrrhas Ere stranger ships had brought from distantshores
Acta per æquoreas hospita navis aquas. of spicy trees the aromatic stores ;
Thura nec Euphrates, nec miserat India costum : From India or Euphrates had not come Nec fuerant rubri cognitafila croci. The fragrant incense or the costly gum ; Ara dabat fumos herbis contenta Sabinis, The simple savin en the altars smok'd , Et non exiguo luurus adusta sono. A laurel sprig the easy gods invok'd :
Siquis erat,factis prati de flore coronis And rich was he, whose votive wreath possessid
Qui posset viulas addere , dives erat. The lovely violet with sweet wild- flowers dresside
Some record that Cecrops introduced the custom of sacrificing oxen ;" but Pausanias, making a comparison between Cecrops and his contemporary Lycaon, king of Arcadia , affirms, that whereas the latter of these sacri ficed a child to Jupiter Lycæus, and polluted the holy altar with human
blood ; the former never sacrificed any thing endued with life, but only the cakes used in his own country , and there called ridaros. Some ages. after, the Athenians were commanded by one of Triptolemus' laws to abstain from living creatures. And even to Draco's time, the Attic
oblations consisted of nothing else but the earth's beneficence. This fru gality and simplicity had in other places been laid aside before this, and
in Athens not long after ; for no sooner did they leave their ancient diet of herbs and roots, and begin to use living creatures for food, which the ancients are said to have thought altogether unlawful; but they also began to change their sacrifices ; it being always usual for their own feasts, and the feasts of the gods ( such they thought the sacrifices), to consist of the
same materials, The solemn sacrifices consisted of these three things, Srovda, Onuiaua,
and ' ligiãoy. This Hesiod 6 seems to imitate in the following verses :

Where it may be observed, that though the more solemn sacrifices con
sisted of all these three parts, yet it was lawful to use some of them by themselves. Whence Eustathius 1 tells us, it was not only usual to offer
drink - offerings of wine at sacrifices, but also at the beginning of a journey
by land or sea, before they went to sleep, when they entertained a stran ger, and at any other time. In short, in all the smaller affairs of life, they seemed to have desired the protection and favour of the gods, by oblations of incense, or drink -offerings ; whereas, the more solemn sacri fices were only used upon set times, and weighty occasions, both because of the expense and trouble of them. The case seems to have been this :
the oblations of the gods, as has been before observed, were furnished after the same manner with the entertainments of men. Hence, as men delight
in different sorts of diet, so the gods were thought to be pleased with several sorts of sacrifices : some with human victims, others with beasts
of various kinds, others with herbs only , and the fruits of the earth. All required salt and drink ; whence there was scarce any sacrifice without salt, and an oblation of drink . The latter of these was frequently offered without victims, though victims were rarely, if ever, sacrificed without oblations of drink ; it being the custom of men to drink without eating, but very seldom to eat a meal without drinking. Σπάνδειν, and λείβειν, amongst the Greeks have the same signification, as
Hesychius and Phavorinus have observed , and imply no more than to pour forth, which is also the proper sense of the Latin word libare, says Isi.
dorus ; but because of their constant use at the drink -offerings of the gods, they came at length to be appropriated to them. The same may be observed of their derivatives orovdn, doußn, and libatio, which words differ
not at all from one another. The matter in the otordà was generally wine. Of wine there were two sorts ; the one fro tovdor, the other coton
dow ; the former was so called, because it was lawful, the latter because it was unlawful to make use of it in these libations ; such they accounted
all wine mixed with water ; whence ärgatov, i. e. pure and unmixed wine, is so often made mention of by ancient writers. Though sometimes mixed
wine is mentioned at sacrifices, yet, if we may believe Eustathius, this mixture was not made of wine and water, but of different sorts of wine. Pliny 3 also tells us that it was unlawful to make an oblation of wine, pressed from grapes cut, pared round, or polluted with a fall on the ground ; or such as came out of a wine-press trodden with bloody and wounded feet,
or from a vine unpruned, blasted, or that had had a man hanged upon it. He speaks also of a certain grape called aspendia,' whose wine it was un

lawful to offer upon the altars. But though these libations generally con
sisted of wine, yet they were sometimes made of other ingredients, and called νηφάλιοι θυσίαι, από του νήφειν, from being sober . Such as these were offered to the Eumenides ; for which Suidas ' gives this reason ,
namely , that divine justice ought always to be vigilant. He likewise adds,
that at Athens such oblations were made to the Nymphs, to Venus, Ura nia, Mnemosyne, the Morning, the Moon , and the Sun ; and there seems
to have been a particular reason , why every one of these were honoured with such oblations. For instance, Eustathius 2 tells us, that honey was
offered to the sun , but wine was never used upon any altar dedicated to him ; because he, by whom all things are encompassed and held together,
ought to be temperate. Plutarch : says, that these inpánsas Ivoice were often performed to Bacchus, for no other reason than that men might not be always accustomed to strong and unmixed wines. Pausanias affirms, that the Eleans never offered wine to the Alorovas, i. e. Ceres and Pro
serpina, nor at the altar dedicated to all the gods. To Pluto, instead of wine, oil was offered, as Virgil * witnesses ; and Homers brings in Ulys
ses telling Alcinous, that he had made an oblation to the infernal gods, in
which he poured forth, first, wine mixed with honey, then, pure wine, and after all, water. His words are these :
-Εγώ δ' άορ οξύ ερυσσάμενος παρά μηρού , I scooped a hollow trench, in measured length Βάθρον δρυξα όσoντε πυγούσιον καινθο και Κυθα:. And breadth a cubit, and libation poured 'Αμφ' αυτό δε χοάς χoμην πάσι νεκύεσσιν, Around for all the nations of the dead, Πρώτα μελικρήτη, μετέπειτα δε ηδέν οίνω, First, milk with honey mix'd, then luscious wine, Το τρίτον αύθ' οπί δ' άλφιτα λευκά πάλυνον . Then water ; sprinkling, last, meal over all. With my faulchion drawn COWPRR .
But concerning the oblations of the infernal gods, I shall discourse in
another place. There were also other gods, to whom , in certain places, they sacrificed without wine; such was Jupiter Fatos, the Supreme, upon whose altar the Athenians never offered wine or living creatures, The νηφάλια τερά ,
sober sacrifices, are divided into four sorts: 1. và vàgóoxorda, libations of water ; 2. tè períowoda, libations of honey ; 3. rå gadarréoroda, liba tions of milk ; 4. Tà inarbonovda, libations of oil. Which liquors were
sometimes mixed with one another. If Porphyry • may be credited , most of the libations in the primitive times were inpárdos. Of these , water was first used, then honey, which is easily to be had , afterwards oil, and in
later ages, wine came to be offered . It is very probable, whether this
order was observed or not, that the most primitive oblations, like the way of living in those ages, were exceedingly simple, and consisted of such
materials as were most easily to be provided. Lastly, it must be farther observed, that libations were always offered in cups full to the brim , it being a sort of irreverence to the gods to pre
sent any thing which was not ríasov xai qey, whole and perfect. Thus to fill the cup was termed ToriQuy xpurñga, to crown it ; and the cup so

of a crown , according to Athenæus . The poets often express this custom. Hence the following verse of Homer: Κούροι δε κρητηρας επεστέψαντο ποτοίο..
And in that allusion of another poet cited by Athenæus,

And

The second thing to be considered in the sacrifices, is the suffitus, in Greek called Juos, which word doth not originally signify the victim, but
sà fairta, i . e, broken fruits, leaves, or acorns, the only sacrifices of the
ancients ; whence, in Suidas, Tà Jún are expounded Jupsánato ,or incense. In like manner, the verb Júes is never used by Homer to signify the offer
ing of the victim (for in this sense, he has made use of piles and deậu), but only of these fourtà, says Athenæus, which signification was afterwards
changed , and almost appropriated to animals . If Adrovandus 4 may be credited , there were no sacrifices in the primitive times, in quibus arbores earumque partes, partem haud exiguam sibi non vendicabant ; whereof
trees or some parts of them were not made a considerable part of the obla
tion . These were chiefly odoriferous trees, some parts whereof roanoi xal vūs T. Júovos, many do even in this age offer, says Porphyry . But the most primitive offerings were only raóut, green herbs, as we are informed by the same author. In later ages, they commonly made use of frankin cense , or some perfume. But it was a long time before frankincense came to be in use . In the times of the Trojan war it was unknown ;
but instead thereof they offered cedar and citron, says Pliny ;6 and the
Grecian fables tell us, that frankincense was first used after the change of a devout youth , called Libanus, into that tree , which has taken its name
from him. It may be farther observed, that some sorts of trees were offered with libations of wine, others only with repeat legd, which are thence called rspúase túra. These, according to Suidas' account, were τα μήτ' αμπέλινα , μήτε σύκινα , μήτε μύρσινα , αιι besides the vine , Eg , and myrrh , which being offered with wine only, were termed oivóozordu . To
this also may be referred the ovroxúrou, ovaai, or mola salsa , which were cakes of salt and barley , ας επίγεον τοϊς βωμούς προ της ιερουργίας , which they poured down upon the altar before the victim was sacrificed . At first
the barley was offered whole and unbroken , till the invention of mills and
grinding, whence they were called ovaai, 9. oras, says Eustathius. To
offer these was termed evnebursīv, and of this custom there is frequent mention in Homer. Of this kind also were the mornya , being round, broad , and thin cakes ; and another sort called Ténavos, of which there were
several kinds, and those three reckoned by Phavorinus, which he calls

Φίσιοι, ανάστατοι, and άμφιφώντες . Another sort of cakes was called σιλή Yes, from the figure being broad and horned, in imitation of the new moon ,
There was another sort of cakes with horns, called also from their figure Bóss , and usually offered to Apollo, Diana, Hecate, and the Moon. In
sacrifices to the Moon , they used, after six of the ordues, to offer one of these, which, for that reason, was termed Boūs ißdouos. The samewas
sometimes offered after a sacrifice of six animals, says Suidas ; and hence
Bows ißdopeos, as being a lump without life, is proverbially used for a stupid and senseless person . There were also other offerings of this sort, peculiar to certain gods, as the obeliophori to Bacchus, the pediTTOŪTOS to Tropho nius, with others, which, for brevity's sake, I omit. It may here be observed, that no oblation was thought acceptable to the gods without a mixture of salt . Nulla ( sacra ) conficiuntur sine mola salsa, ' no sacrifice
is made without meal mixed with salt ,' says Pliny. There is continual mention hereof in the poets. Thus in Virgil:
-Mihi
sacra
parari
Et fruges salse
And in Ovid, describing the primitive oblations:3
Ante, deos homini quod conciliare valeret, In early times the gods were cheaply pleased ; Far erat, et puri lucida mica salis . A little meal with salt their wrath appeased. c.8 .
This custom was certainly very ancient and universal. To forbear the mention of other testimonies, we find this precept given to Moses :
· Every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt: neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy
meat-offering; with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt .' The origin of this custom is by some affirmed to be, that salt was a token of friendship and hospitality It being also constantly used in all the victuals of men, was thought necessary to the entertainments and sacrifices of the gods, as
was before observed. For the same reason there was scarce any sacrifice
without bread-corn, or bread . Particularly barley was offered more than any other grain, that being the first sort of corn which the Greeks used
after their primitive diet of acorns; whence xgibi is by some derived from xgivev, to discern , men being first by that sort of food distinguished from
other animals, with whom they had before lived upon acorns . On the same account the Athenians offered only such barley as grew in the field Rharium, in memory of its having first been sown there. Instead of the
Greek xgids, the Romans used another sort called Said, which was the sort
of corn first used by them. This practice remained in the time of Diony sius the Halicarnassean.7

the very best of all the flocks and herds ; to which end Solon , in his laws, commanded the Athenians to offer &xxgira iegsid, chosen and select sacri
fices ; and it was an ancient custom to cull out of the flocks the goodliest of all the cattle, and put certain marks upon them, whereby they might be
distinguished from the rest. Virgil tells us their herds were divided into
three parts, one of which they designed for propagation , another for sacri fice, and the third for labour ; his words are these :
Post partum cura in vitulos traducitur omnis, To note the tribe, the lineage, and the sire : Continuoque notas, et nomina gentis inurunt ; Et quos aut pecori malint submittere habendo, Or who shall be to sacrifice preferred ; Aut aris servare sacros , aut scindere terram .

The same is affirmed by Apollonius Rhodius in the second book of his Argonautics.2
Notwithstanding
all
this
care
in
the
choice
of
victims
,
it
was
thought
unlawful
to

them
,
till
the

had
,
by
various
experiments
,
made
trial
of
them
,
of
which
I
shall
speak

not

As
to

kinds
of

offered
in

,
they
differed
according
to
the
variety
of
the
gods
to
whom
,
and
the
persons
by
whom
,
they
were
offered

Almost
every
god
had
some

animals

,

of

,
sacrifices
were

all others eaten by men , and sacrificed to the gods. Hence its Greek name rūs, termed in Latin also sus, is thought to have been so called by
changing I into o , from Júsuv, to kill or sacrifice. The same animal is
also allowed by Porphyry ? to have been offered in sacrifice before any other, though upon a different account; for he derives it from a command
of Apollo, who, to excuse Clymene's killing a sow , ordered, that in times to come that animal should be offered in sacrifice, Next to the sow , the
goat came, to be sacrificed , which happened by reason of its browsing upon the vines, and thence becoming an enemy to Bacchus. Thus we find in
Ovid :3 Et prima putatur The entrasted seed, was judged to spoil the crop,
Hostia sus meruisse necem , quia semina pando And intercept the sweating farmer's hope.
Eruerat rostro, spemque interceperat anni. The goat came next in order to be tried :
Vite caper morsa Bacchi mactatus ad aras Her hunger was no plea ; for that she died . Ducitur ultoris : nocuit sia culpa duobus. The goat had cropt the tendrils of the vine,
The sow , with her broad snout, for rooting up And this had lost his profit,thathis wine. GARTH.
The animals most commonly sacrificed were, besides the two foremen tioned, the bull, ox, cow , sheep, lamb, &c. , and amongst the birds, the
cock, hen , &c. Some were more acceptable at one age than another. For example, a heifer a year old, which had never been put to the yoke, was most grateful to the gods. Such a one is promised to Minerva by
Diomedes in Homer ; 4 Σοί δ' αύ εγώ ρίξω βούν ήνιν εύρυμέτωπον, A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,
'Αδμήτην, ήν ούπω υπό ζυγόν ήγαγεν ανήρ. Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke.- POPE
Another is elsewhere promised by Nestor.5 The same may also be observed in other poets. And the Jews were commanded to sacrifice a
heifer, without spot, wherein was no blemish, and upon which never came
yoke ;$ such as had been employed in the service of men being unworthy to be made victims to God. The Boeotians were wont to sacrifice certain eels of an unusual biguess, taken in Copais, a lake of that country, and about these they performed all
the ceremonies usual at other sacrifices. It will be difficult to guess the
reason of this custom , for we are told , that when a stranger once happened to be present at these sacrifices, and inquired what might be the cause of them, the Boeotians made him no other answer, than that they were
obliged to observe the customs of their ancestors, but thought themselves not bound to give foreigners any reason for them. Almost the only ani
mal which it was unlawful to sacrifice, was the ploughing and labour ing ox ; and from him the Athenians abstained, because he assisted them in tilling the ground, and was, as it were, man's fellow -labourer. Nor
did the Athenians only, but almost all other nations, think it a very great crime to kill this creature, insomuch that the offender was thought to
deserve death.10 Ælian 11. in particular witnesses as much of the Phrygi

ans ; and Pliny 1 in his Natural History mentions a person banished Rome on that account. But in later times 2 they were used at feasts, and then
it was no wonder if they were also sacrificed to the gods; and that they were so , Lucian assures us. Nay, to eat and sacrifice oxen , came at
length to be so common, that Boudutxi was used as a general term instead of Júsiv, mactare. Thus in Aristophanes:
Και
νύν
δεσπότης
μεν
ένδον
βoυθυτεί
" Υν , και τράγον, και κριον εστεφανωμένος.5
The person who first adventured to kill a labouring ox was Cecrops, according to Eusebius. Aratus charges it upon the men of the brazen
age : 6 -πρώτοί γε βοών επάσαντ ' άροτήρων .
But Theon , in his commentary upon that passage , affirms that the killing of labouring oxen was held unlawful in the time of the Trojan war, and
that the companions of Ulysses, who are reported by Homer to have suf
fered very much for their impiety in killing the sacred oxen of the sun , were only guilty of killing the ploughing and labouring oxen , by whose assistance we are nourished and see the sun . He farther adds, that the
Athenians were the first who fed upon the flesh of such oxen .
Neither
was
it
lawful
to
sacrifice
oxen
only
,
but
also
men
.

captives at the funeral of Patroclus. Æneas, whom Virgill celebrates
for his piety, is an example of the same practice,2 Sacrifices were to be suitable to the condition and quality of the person by whom they were offered . As it was thought a contempt of the gods for a rich man to bring a poor sordid offering; so , on the other hand , from
a poor man the smallest oblations were acceptable. If his circumstances did not enable him to offer a living ox , it was lawful for him to sacrifice,
in its stead, one made of bread - corn . And on other accounts , when they
were not able to provide the accustomed sacrifices, they were at liberty to offer what the place or time would afford. Hence the Cyzicenians, being
closely besieged, and unable to procure a black ox, which they were obliged to offer upon a certain anniversary festival, made one of corn , and so performed the usual ceremonies. The companions of Ulysses in
Homer, for want of barley, made use of oak leaves ; and instead of wine, offered a libation of water. But from those that were able to procure them , more costly offerings were required . Men of wealth, especially when
they had received, or desired any great favour of the gods, offered great numbers of animals at once ; whence there is frequent mention of heca tombs, which consisted of an hundred living creatures, and of chiliombs, in
which a thousand were sacrificed . A hecatomb, says Eustathius,* pro perly signifies a sacrifice of an hundred oxen, and such a one was offered
by Clisthenes in Herodotus; but is generally taken for such sacrifices as consist of an hundred animals of any surt ; only the ox being the principal
and most valuable of all the living creatures used at sacrifices , it has its name from containing exatör Bows, an hundred oxen . Others derive it from
ixatòy Báoeis, hrou zódes, namely, an hundred feet, and then it must have consisted only of twenty -five animals. Some think a finite number is put
for an indefinite ; and then a hecatomb amounts to no more than a sacri
fice consisting of many animals. Others derive the name not from the
number of the victims, but of the persons present at the sacrifice . Lastly, it may be observed ,5 that a hecatomb was sometimes offered after this manner : they erected an hundred altars of turf, and then killed an hundred Sows, or sheep, &c. Another sacrifice ,6 consisted of seven offerings,
namely, a sheep, sow, goat, ox, hen, goose, and after all an ox of meal,
whence some derive the proverb, Bows ißdopos. Another sacrifice, in which only three animals were offered , was called τριττύς , Or τριττύα . This consisted ? of two sheep and an ox ; sometimes of an ox, goat, and
sheep ; sometimes of a boar, ram , and bull ; and at other times of a sow , he- goat, and ram. Sometimes the sacrifice consisted of twelve animals, and then it was called Sodexedes Juría , and the rest in like manner.

OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE . 223
With regard to the preparatory rites required before, and the ornaments used in the time of sacrifice, no man who had not purified himself cer
tain days before, during which he was to abstain from all carnal pleasures, was admitted to some of the solemn sacrifices. So rigid were they in observing this custom at some of their solemnities, that the priests and priestesses were forced to take an oath that they were duly purified . The
following is the form of that imposed upon the priestesses of Bacchus at
Athens : 2 “Αγιστεύω , και είμι καθαρά, και αγνή από των άλλων των ού καθαριυ órtwy, xai ir avdeos ouvoūsuceso 4,5... I am pure, undefited , and freefrom all sorts ofpollution, and particularly that which is contracted by lying with
a man ; and do celebrate the festival of Bacchus at the usual time, and according to the received custom of my country. This seems to be meant
not only of adultery and fornication, but also of the lawful pleasures of the marriage -bed ; for at the celebration of divine solemnities they thought
more than ordinary purity and sanctity were required of them, and there
fore abstained from delights which at other times they might lawfully enjoy . Yet by some of them this sort of purification was thought unne cessary : for Theano, an Athenian priestess, being asked when it might be lawful for a woman to go from the company of a man to the divine mysteries ? answered , From her own at any time, from a stranger never . Every person who came to the solemn sacrifices was purified by water. For this purpose, a vessel full of holy water was commonly placed at the
entrance of the temples. This water was consecrated by putting into it a burning torch taken from the altar. The same torch was sometimes used to besprinkle those who entered the temple ."
Φέρε δε το δαδίον, τόδ' όμβάψω λαβών. Bring the torch, and taking it I will purify.*
Where the scholiast observes, that this torch was used because of the
quality of fire, which is thought to purify all things. Instead of torches, they sometimes used a branch of laurel. Thus Sozomen , where he
speaks of Valentinian following Julian into a pagan temple, relates, that when they were about to enter, a priest θαλλούς τινας διαβρόχους κατέχων,
rógew'Elanurã migréộparve, holding certain green boughs dropping water, besprinkled them after the Grecian manner. Instead of laurel, olive was sometimes used .?
7 Before the sacrifices of the celestial gods, the worshippers had their
whole bodies washed, or if that could not be, at least their hands; but for
those that performed the sacred rites to the infernal gods, a small sprink ling was sufficient. Sometimes the feet were washed as well as the hands ;

whence came the proverbs, & virtos xepois, and óvintos govis, in Latin illotis manibus, and illotis pedibus,) which are usually applied to men who undertake any thing without due care and preparation. A programme
was fixed up, that no man should go beyond the megappartúgsov, .or vessel which contained the water of purification , till he had washed his hands ;!
and so great a crime was it accounted to omit this ceremony, that one Asterius is said to have been struck dead with thunder, because he had approached the altar of Jupiter with unwashed hands.? Nor was this
custom only observed at solemn sacrifices, but also in the less important parts of their worship. Hector tells us he was afraid to make so much as a libation to Jupiter before he had washed , and Telemachus is said in
Homer's Odyssey to have washed his hands before he durst pray to the
gods. This they did from a belief that thereby they were purified from
their sins ; and withal signifying, that nothing impure ought to approach the deities. For the same reason they sometimes washed their clothes, as Homer relates of Penelope, before they offered prayers to the gods.
The water used in purification was required to be clear, and free from any impurity. It was commonly from fountains and rivers . The water of
lakes, or standing ponds, was unfit for this purpose . So was also the purest stream , if it had been a con able time separated from its
source. Hence recens aqua , ' fresh water ,' is applied to this use in Virgil.' The same custom prevailed in other countries. The Jewish Essenes
made use of καθαρωτέρων, των προς άγνείαν υδάτων, the purer sort of water for cleansing . The apostle seems to allude to the same practice in the following words:6 • Let us draw near — having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.' phet Ezekiel, in like manner : " Then I will sprinkle clean water upon
you, and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness, and from all your
idols, will I cleanse you .” But if sea -water could be procured , it was preferred before all others, because, by reason of its saltness, qúos tò üdwg της θαλάσσης καθαρτικόν έστι, the water of the sea is naturally cathartic.8 Hence Aristæus reports concerning some of the Jews who lived near the
sea, that every day before matins they used απονίψασθαι θαλάσση τας xrigas, to wash their hands in the sea. The Argonauts in Apollonius are said to find Circe washing her head in the sea :9 and that saying of Euripides,
θάλασσα κλύζει πάντα τ' ανθρώπων κακά, The cleansing sea removes all human ills ,
is applied to superstitious men, οι θαλάσση περικαθαίρονται, who purified themselves in the sea , according to Stobæus. When sea -water could not
easily be procured, they sometimes mixed the water with salt , and to that they frequently added brimstone, which also was thought to be endued

It may be farther observed, that the purified person was thrice besprinkled, the number three being commonly observed in the performance of religious ceremonies.3
There are two ways of purifying mentioned in the Moral Characters of
Theophrastus, which differ from those already described. The first by drawing round the person purified , a squill, or sea onion . The second,
called περισκυλακισμός , from σκύλαξ, α whelp , which was drawn about the purified person . This method was used by almost the whole Greek
nation , Grangæus, in his commentary on the forementioned passage of
Juvenal, mentions another way of purifying, by fanning in the air.

married women, and at Athens all bastards , except in the temple of Hercules at Cynosarges, where they were permitted to be present, because Hercules himself was under some illegitimacy , being not one of the great immortal gods, but having a mortal woman for his mother. It was also unlawful for the AzurepóroTp01, or ' Torsgónotu.1;9 that is,
such as had been thought dead, and after the celebration of the funeral
rites unexpectedly recovered ; or those who, after a long absence in foreign countries, where it was believed they were dead, returned safe home to enter into the temple of the Eumenides. Such persons at Athens were
purified by being let through the lap of a woman's gown, that so they might seem to be newly born, and were then admitted to the holy rites.

Jo like manner, at Rome, such as had been thought dead in battle, and afterwards unexpectedly escaped from their enemies, and returned home, were not permitted to enter at the door of their own house , but were received at a passage opened in the roof. It would be endless to mention all those who were accounted profane at particular sacrifices or places ; I shall only , therefore, in general add, that before the ceremonies were begun, the Kñguž, or sometimes the priest, with a loud voice , commanded
all such to be gone, as in Callimachus :'
έκας, εκάς όστις αλυτρός
In allusion to this custom, Orpheus commands the doors to be shut before he explains the mysterious parts of philosophy.
Φθέγξομαι οίς θέμις έστε, θύρας δ' επίθεσθε βεβήλοις I'll sacred oracles to them proclaim , Whom virtue doth with quickening heat infiame ; But the profane, far hence be they remov'd . - J . A.
Sometimes the interior part of the temple was divided from the other by a cord, beyond which the Bibrao. were not permitted to pass . This cord
is called in Greek oxovíov, whence men excluded from the holy rites are called by Demosthenes ? ¿Tiroivio uivos, separated by a cord .

The ornaments used in the time of sacrifice were such as follow : The
priests were richly attired, their garments being usually the same, at
least not much differing from royal robes. At Athens they sometimes used the costly and magnificent garment invented by Æschylus for the
tragedians. At Sparta, their garments were suitable to the other parts of their worship, being neither costly nor splendid ; and they always prayed and sacrificed with their feet uncovered .
In all holy worship, their clothes were to be without spots or stains,
loose, and unbound. If they had been touched by a dead body, or struck
by thunder, or polluted in any other way, it was unlawful for the priests to officiate in them. The purity of the sacerdotal robes is frequently insisted on in the poets.

rhose honour the solemnities were celebrated. They who sacrificed to
he celestial gods were clothed with purple ; to the infernal gods they acrificed in black, to Ceres in white garments. They had also crowns
pon their heads, which were generally composed of the leaves of the tree vhich was accounted sacred to the god to whom they paid their devotions. Thus, in the sacrifices of Apollo ,2 they were crowned with laurel; in
hose of Hercules, with poplar. Crowns and garlands were thought so necessary to recommend men to the gods, and were so anciently used, hat some have derived the custom of wearing them at feasts, from the
vrimitive entertainments at which the gods were thought to be present. S Besides this crown, the priest sometimes wore upon his head a sacred infula , or mitre, from which, on each side, hung à riband . Infulæ were
commonly made of wool, and were not only worn by the priest, but were
put upon the horns of the victim, and upon the temple and altar. In like manner also , were the crowns used by them all. But the covering of the head with a mitre was rather a Roman than a Grecian custom, and was
first introduced into Italy by Æneas, who covered his head and face, lest any ill -boding omen appearing to him should disturb the religious rites. Nevertheless , some of the Roman sacrifices were offered after the Grecian
fashion , á trpaxchúaTW xspaas, with their heads uncovered , and in particular those of Saturn , the rites whereof were first brought from Greece .? The same is affirmed by Dionysius the Halicarnassean ,8 con
cerning the sacrifices offered on the great altar of Hercules, which were first instituted by Evander the Arcadian. The victims had the infula
and the ribands tied to their horns, the crowns and garlands upon their necks. Whether this order was perpetual, is not certain . However, that
victims were adorned with garlands, is attested by innumerable examples,
whereof I shall only at present mention that of Polyxena, who being to be
sacrificed , is called by Lycophron ° στεφηφόρος βούς, because εστεφάνουν και ärdeory i TUTTON TOūs Juopévous, they adorned with garlands, and bestrewed with flowers, them who are sacrificed . Upon solemn occasions, as the reception and petition of any signal benefit, they overlaid the victim's
hords with gold. Thus Diomedes in Homer promises Minerva : 10
Τήν του εγώ ρίξω χρυσόν κέρασαν περιχεύας..

Alluding to this custom , Porphyry calls the oxen designed for sacrifice
xerooxégous. Pliny 11 states, that the larger sacrifices only, such as oxen, were thus adorned ; but the contrary appears from a decree of the Roman senate , 12 in which the decemviri are commanded to sacrifice to Apollo,

after the Grecian manner, an ox, and two she- goats with gilded horns, unless as some think, goats were also numbered amongst the hostie majores, or greater victims ; as the sheep were counted maximæ , or the greatest, not for their bigness, but their value, and acceptableness to the gods. The altars were decked with sacred herbs, called by the Romans verbena ; which is a general name for all the herbs used at sacrifices ; and
here, as at other times, every god had his peculiar herb , in which he was thought to delight. The solemn times of sacrificing were varied according to the temper of
the gods . To the celestial gods they sacrificed υπό την έω ανατέλλοντος TOŨ maíov, in the morning, about the time of the sun's rising, or at least in
open day. To the manes and subterraneous gods, who were thought to hate the light, and to frequent the earth by night only , they offered their
devotions pipiraiou dvouds, about sunset, and very often at midnight; at which time the magical rites, over which Hecate presided, were cele brated .
All things being prepared, the mola salsa, with the knife, or other instrument to kill the victims, and the crowns, were brought in a basket
called ravoūv, whence the Athenian virgins, whose office it was to carry this basket at the Panathenæa, and some other solemnities, were called
κανηφόροι.. The victim , if it was a sheep, or any of the smaller animals, was driven
loose to the altar ; but the larger sacrifices often were brought by the horns. Sometimes 3 the victims were led by a rope ; but then it was a
long one, and not close or strait, lest the victim should seem to be brought by force to the altar. And lest the victim should seem to be sacrificed
unwillingly, and by constraint, the cords were commonly loosed . In one of Aristotle's epigrams, an old woman leads a bull to the altar by his ear, to show his compliance:
Τούτον γρους στείχουσα μόνη μόνον ούατος έλκει Τόνδ ' επί βωμόν ο δ', ώς μασέρι παίς , έπεται .
Sometimes there were certain persons appointed to fetch the sacrifice with musical instruments, and other solemnities ; but this was seldom practised , except at the larger sacrifices, such as hecatombs.
After this, they stood about the altar, and 5 the priest turning towards the right hand, went round it, and sprinkled it with meal and holy water ;
he besprinkled also those who were present, taking a torch from the altar , or a branch of laurel. This water was called xéprey, being the same they
washed their hands with at purification . On both which accounts the poets
use xspvíttsoba, instead of ispia pézsıy, to offer sacrifice. The vessels alse they purified with onions, water , brimstone, or eggs.

Prayer being ended , the priest, having previously examined all the members of the victim , to see if it had any blemish, or other defect, pro
ceeded now to examine, unless this also had been done before, whether it
was sound within. For this purpose ineat was set before it, as barley -meal before bulls, vetches before goats ; which if it refused to eat it was judged unsound. They sometimes besprinkled it with cold water, which, if it
endured without shrinking, it was thought to be some way indisposed ." This being done, they made trial whether the victim was willing to be
sacrificed to the gods, by drawing a knife from its forehead to the tail ;5 at which if the victim struggled, it was rejected, as not acceptable to the
gods; but if it stood quiet at the altar, then they thought the gods were pleased with it ; yet a bare non - resistance was not thought sufficient, un
less it also gave its consent, as it were, by a gracious nod , which was the ancient manner of granting, or approving (whence the word iTivebeu among the Greeks, and annuere among the Romans, signifies to give assent to
any thing ), and to this end, they poured water into its ear, and sometimes
barley, which they called # goxúras.O After this, they prayed again ; then the priest took a cup of wine, and having tasted it himself, caused the company to do so likewise, and powed forth the remainder between the horns of the victim.? , This custom is everywhere mentioned in authors; but it will be sufficient to observe this
one example, in that remarkable epigram of Furius Evenus, wherein the vine thus bespeaks the goat :

230 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIÉS.
Κών με φάγης επί ρίζαν, όμως ότι καρποφορήσω And tear the swelling clusters from my boughs, « Οσσον επισπεύσαί σοι, τράγο, θυoμένω. Luxuriant sprouts will shoot out fresh supplies,
Though, lecherous goat, you on my scions browse, To pour betwixt your horns at your own sacrifice. R. H.
After this, frankincense, or other incense, was strewed upon the altar, and, as some say, upon the forehead of the victim ; being taken out of the cen
ser, called in Greek Jupicuathglos, with three fingers."
Hence it is, that the Pythia in Porphyry says, that the whole hecatombs of the Thessalians were not more acceptable to the gods, than the futà , which a certain Hermionian offered with his three fingers. Then they
poured forth part of the otaad on the back of the victim , which was upon that account bedewed with a small sprinkling of water. This being done, they prayed again , and then offered the remainder of the oúrad upon the
altar: all these they called IIgobúvara , as being offered before the victim.
Then the priest, or the Kõguč, or sometimes the most honourable person in the company when no priest was present, killed the beast, by striking him down, or cutting his throat. Sometimes the person who killed and prepared the victim, which was accounted a more ignoble office , was dif ferent from him who offered it upon the altar. If the sacrifice was in
honour of the celestial gods, the throat was bended up towards heaven ,
and this Homer calls að éqúev, or in one word , avigúciv : but if the sacri fice was made to the heroes or infernal gods, it was killed with its throat
towards the ground. If by any chance the beast escaped the stroke, Jeaped up after it, bellowed, did not fall prone upon the ground, after the
fall kicked and stamped, was restless, as though it expired with pain and difficulty, did not bleed freely, and was a long time dying, it was thought unacceptable to the gods; all these being unlucky omens, as their contraries were tokens of divine favour and good -will. The Kúgures did
then help to flay the beast, light the wood, and do other inferior offices, while the priest, or soothsayer, with a long knife turned over the bowels
to observe, and make predictions from them ( it being unlawful to touch them with his hands). The blood was reserved in a vessel called o paysier,
àuvíoy, or, Ilorjavogic , and offered on the altar to the celestial gods ; if the sacrifice belonged to the gods of the sea, it was poured into salt water ; but
if they were by the sea - side, they slew not the victim over the opensier,
but over the water, into which they sometimes threw the victim.3

Jupiter, that one part only might be offered to the gods, and the remain
der reserved for themselves. The parts belonging to the gods were the pengoà; these they covered with fat, called in Greek xvioon, in order that they might consume altogether in a flame: for except all was burned, they
thought they did not xad dosesiv, or litare, i . e. that their sacrifice was not
accepted by the gods. Upon the ungoà were cast small pieces of flesh , cut from every part of the beast, as the daugyed, or first-fruits of the whole; the doing this they called ipobetzīv, either because they first cut the shoul der, which is in Greek called ipòs, or because they did ispede sideales, put these raw pieces of flesh upon the other parts . The ungol, thighs, were appropriated to the gods, because of the honour due to these parts , διά το λυσιτελείν τοις ζώοις εις βάδισίν τε και γένεσιν, because of their service to animals in walking and generating. And
hereby they commended , in the mystical sense of this rite, both them selves and all their actions and enterprises to the divine protection . So says
Eustathius ;4 but Casaubon 5 tells us, they sometimes offered the entrails,
herein contradicting Eustathius, who informs us that these were divided among the persons present at the sacrifice; and Homer, in the description
of his sacrifices, usually tells us that they feasted upon them, orhárxi' επάσαντο . By the word σπλάγχνα , though it properly signify the bowels,
are to be understood, says my author,6 the spleen , liver, and heart ; and that it is sometimes taken for the heart, will appear by the signification
of its compounds: for by őorhayxvos åving, is meant a pusillanimous man ; as on the contrary, svorhayxvos, denotes a man of courage." Yet in some
places the entrails were burned upon the altar . But Dionysius the Hali carnassean , comparing the Grecian and Roman rites of sacrifice, affirms,
that only the drugXud of the entrails, as has been observed concerning the other members, were sacrificed . “ Having washed their hands,' says he, and purified the victims with clear water, and bestrewed their heads with the fruits of Ceres, they pray to the gods, and then command the officers
to kill the victims: some of these do thereupon knock down the victim, others cut its throat when fallen to the ground , others flay off its hide,
divide the body into its several members ; and cut off the first fruits
(aragràs) from every entrail, and other members, which being sprinkled with harley meal, are presented upon canisters to the persons who offer the sacrifice, by whom they are laid upon the altar to be burnt, and whilst
they are consuming in the fire, wine is poured upon them. All which is
performed according to the Grecian rites of sacrifice, as will easily appear from the poems of Homer. He then proceeds to confirm this descrip
tion of the sacrifices by several testimonies out of Homer, which being
to the same purpose with others already cited out of that poet, shall be omitted .

GRECIAN
ANTIQUITIES

Whilst the sacrifice was burning, the priest and the person who gave the victim , jointly made their prayers to the god , with their hands upon the altar, which was the usual posture in praying, as will be shown here after. Sometimes they played upon musical instruments in the time of sacrifice, thinking hereby to charm the god into à propitious humour, as appears by a story related 1 of Ismenias, who playing upon a pipe at a sacrifice, when no lucky omens appeared, the man by whom he was hired
snatched the pipe, and played very ridiculously himself ; and when all the
company found fault with him, he said, “ To play satisfactorily is the gift of heaven .' Ismenias, with a smile , replied, “ Whilst I played , the gods were so ravished with the music , that they were careless of the sacrifice,
but to be rid of thy noise, they presently accepted it.' This custom was most in use at the sacrifices of the aërial deities, who were thought to de
light in musical instruments and harmonious songs. It was also customary on some occasions to dance round the altars
whilst they sung the sacred hymns, which consisted of three stanzas, or parts ; the first of which, called strophe, was sung in turning from east to west ; the other, named antistrophe, in returning from west to east ; then
they stood before the altar, and sung the epode, which was the last part of the song. These hymns were generally composed in honour of the gods,
contained an account of their famous actions, their clemency and liberality, and the benefits conferred by them upon mankind ; and concluded with a petition for the continuation of their favours. They were all called by a
general name IIzeãuss, but there was also a particular name belonging to the hymns of almost every god. For instance, the hymn of Venus was called ' Triggòs, that of Apollo was peculiarly named Tasày, and both of
them were styled Προσώδια the hymns of Bacchus were called Διθύραμβοι,, &c. Of all musical instruments, the flute seems to have been most used
at sacrifices, whence comes the proverb Aiantoũ Bíov zmy, applied to those that live upon other men's charges, because Avantai, flute- players, used to attend on sacrifices, and to partake of them , and so lived on free cost . '
At some of the Jewish sacrifices, the priests sounded trumpets, whilst the victims were burned upon the altar . And most of the heathen nations were possessed with a belief that the gods were affected with the charms
of music in the same manner as men. On which account they are ridi culed by the Christian apologists . But, as has been several times ob served, the feasts or sacrifices of the gods being managed in the same manner with the entertainments of men , it is no wonder that musical
instruments, so much used by all nations at their feasts and merry meet ings, should be admitted at the festivals and sacrifices of the gods.
The sacrifice being ended , the priest had his share, of which an account
is given in the preceding chapter. A tenth part was also due to the magistrates called Ilguráveis, at Athens. At Sparta, the kings had the

paid to the household gods: whence comes the proverb, «Q'Errias äexsobe , to begin at home. This custom 1 was founded upon a grant of Jupiter to Vesta. After he had suppressed the sons of Titan, he promised Vesta to grant whatever she would request ; whereupon she first desired
that she might enjoy perpetual virginity ; and, in the next place, that she might have the first part in all sacrifices. The last part also, as well as the first, was offered to Vesta, she being the same with the earth , to which
the first and last parts belong; because all things are produced out of that element, and again resolved into it : or because Vesta, who presides over are et foci, the altars and hearths ' of houses, is custos rerum intimarum , • keeper of the most secret things ,' and on that account to be honoured above all other deities. Which reason is assigned by Cicero . To return ; the feast in some places was to be ended before sunset, and was not to exceed an appointed time in any place. After the feast they sometimes
played at dice - a custom derived no doubt from the common practice of recreating themselves with all sorts of plays and diversions after meals.
Neither were dice only, but any other sort of game, used after the feasts upon sacrifices. Hence of the Jews, who had sacrificed to the golden calf, it is said, that they sat down to eat, and rose up to play. But of this custom a more particular account will be given when the Grecian entertainments shall be described . The entertainment and recreations
being ended, they returned to the altar, and offered a libation to Jupiter Teasios, the Perfect. The primitive Greeks were wont to offer the
tongues, together with a libation of wine, to Mercury . The tongues they offered at this time, either with a design to make an expiation for any
indecent language which had been spoken, or in token that they committed to the gods as witnesses what discourse had passed at the table ; or to
signify that what had been spoken there ought not to be remembered after wards or divulged. They were offered to Mercury, the god of eloquence, as taking a particular care of that member.6

Besides the sacrifices, there were also other sorts of presents offered to the gods, even from the earliest times, either to pacify them when angry , or to obtain some future benefit, or as a grateful acknowledgment of some
past favour. These consisted of crowns and garlands, garments , cups of
gold, or other valuable metals, and any other thing which conduced to the ornament or the enriching of the temples : they were commonly termed αναθήματα, and sometimes ανακείμενα , from their being deposited in the temples, where they sometimes were laid on the floor, sometimes hung

upon the walls, doors, pillars, or the roof, or any other conspicuous place.
Sometimes the occasion of the dedication was inscribed either upon the
thing itself, or when the matter of that could not bear an inscription , upon a tablet hung up with it .?
When any person left his employment or way of life, it was customary to dedicate the instruments belonging to it, as a grateful commemoration
of the divine favour and protection. Thus,» a fisherman dedicated his nets to the nymphs of the sea. Shepherds hung up their pipes to Pan, or some of the country deities. Lais, decayed with age, dedicated her mirror to Venus . Whoever is willing to be farther informed concerning
the nature and kinds of these presents, may consult Pausanias, who has left us a very particular description of those in the Delphian temple, which was the richest of any in Greece.
By a very ancient and universal prescription, the tenths of many things were claimed by the gods. Hence the Greeks, having driven the Per sians out of Greece, presented a golden tripod to Delphian Apollo out of the tenths of the spoils taken in the war.” The Argives, Athonians, and Ionians, dedicated a golden buckler to Jupiter after the taking of Tanagra.8 Lucian mentions the tenths of spoils dedicated to Mars. A golden chariot and horses were consecrated to Pallas by the Athenians, 10 The
tenth part of the product of a certain field consecrated to Diana was sacri
ficed every year.11 The Siphnians constantly presented a tenth part of their gold mines to Apollo.12 It was also customary for kings to receive a tenth portion of the several revenues of their subjects. This was paid by
the Athenians to Pisistratus, the receiving whereof that tyrant excuses in
his epistle to Solon, 13 as being not expended in his own private service, but laid out upon sacrifices, and for other public uses. The same custom
prevailed in other countries ; whence Samuel describes some of the incon
veniences which the Jews were bringing upon themselves by desiring a king, in the following words: 14 He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give them to his officers and to his servants. He will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall be his servants. So con
stant and universal was the custom of paying tenths to the gods and kings
that δεκατευται , and δεκαταλόγοι, collectors of tenths, are general names for Tiwras, publicans, or collectors of taxes ; and dexateúsiy is equivalent
to καθιερώσαι, λαφυραγωγείν or τελωνείν , which words signify to consecrate , or to gather tributes and taxes.15 And that the same was derived from the most early times, appears from the well known example of Abraham , who
gave tithes of all to Melchisedeck, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God . 16

CHAP. V.
OF THE GRECIAN PRAYERS, SUPPLICATIONS, AND IMPRECATIONS.
The piety of the ancient Greeks, and the honourable opinion they had
conceived of their deities, appears in nothing more manifestly than in
the continual prayers and supplications they made to them ; for no man amongst them that was endued with the smallest prudence,? would under take any thing of greater or lesser moment, without having first asked the
advice and assistance of the gods; for this they thought the surest means to have all their enterprises crowned with success.
And
that
this
was
practised
by
the
whole
nation
of
the
Greeks
,
as
well
as
by
their
philoso
phers
,
and
that
in
the
most
primitive
times
,
is
fully
witnessed
by
their
poets
,
and
other
ancient
writers
.
Thus
,
in
Homer's
ninth
Iliad
,
Nestor
is
introduced
praying
for
success
to
the
ambassadors
whom
the
Grecian
chiefs
were
sending
to
Achilles
.
In
the
tenth
Iliad
,
Ulysses
enters
upon
his
expedition
into
the
Trojan
camp
in
the
same
manner
.
In
the
last
Iliad
,
Priam
entreats
the
assistance
of
the
gods
,
before
he
durst
venture
himself
into
the
tent
of
Achilles
to
redeem
Hector's
body
.
And
to
for
bear
other
instances
,
the
heroes
seldom
engage
with
their
enemies
till
they
have
first
implored
the
divine
protection
and
favour
.
It seems to have been the universal practice of all nations, whether civil
or barbarous, to recommend themselves to their several deities every morning and evening. Whence we are informed by Plato, that at the rising both of the sun and moon, one might everywhere behold the Greeks and barbarians, those in prosperity, as well as those under calamities and afflictions, prostrating themselves, and hear their supplications.ʻs
The
Lacedæmonians
had
a
peculiar
form
of
prayer
;
for
they
never
used
,
either
in
their
public
or
private
devotions,
to
make
any
other
request,
than
that
the
gods
would
grant
what
was
honourable
and
good
for
them
,
and
that
they
might
be
able
to
suffer
injuries
.
The
Athenians
,
5
in
their
public
prayers
,
desired
prosperity
for
themselves
and
the
Chians
;
and
at
the
Panathenæa,
a
solemnity
which
was
celebrated
once
in
five
years
,
the
public
crier
used
to
implore
the
blessing
of
the
gods
upon
the
Athenians
and
Platæans, Petitioners,
both
to
the
gods
and
men
,
used
to
supplicate
with
green
boughs
in
their
hands
,
and
crowns
upon
their
heads
,
or
garlands
upon
their
necks
;
which
they
did
with
a
design
to
beget
respect
in
those
to
whom
they
made
their
supplications.
These
boughs
were
called
by
various
names
,
as

they were åsbadsīs, always green and flourishing, whence the epithet of exágætos, never -fading, is given to the latter ; or because the laurel was a sign of victory , success, and joy ; the olive of peace and good -will. In these boughs they put wool, which was not tied to them, but wrapped about them ; for which reason the tragedian 2 seems to have called it do hory ädsomeon Quadédos, the tie without a knot, And from their being
wrapped round , some think that they were called by the Romans vitta , or infulæ :3 and by the Greeks they were termed otájjata ' in which sense Homer is by some thought to have used this word :* Στέμματ' έχων εν χερσίν εκηβόλου Απόλλωνος .
For, according to the old scholia upon Sophocles,5 oréjepa is to be inter
preted si agoonia nuévov igsoy sã sanaã, certain wool wrapped about a green bough . With these boughs, and sometimes with their hands, if they were
doubtful whether they should prevail or not, it was usual to touch the knees of the statue or man , to whom they addressed themselves : if they had hopes, they touched his right hand, but never the left, that being
thought unlucky ; if they were confident of success, they rose as high as his chin or cheeks. It was customary to touch the head , either because that is the principal and most honourable member in a man's body ;' or
because they desired the person should give his consent to their petitions annuendo, ' by a nod ,' for this was the manner of granting requests. The hand they touched 8 as being the instrument of action : the knees, because
they desired the soul of the person should bend, as it were, and incline to their requests, for that the joints in that place are more flexible than in
any other part ; or because the knees are the instruments of motion, as if they requested the person to bestir himself, and walk about to effect their
desires. Whence , to use the words of Pliny,' hominis genibus, quædam
religio inest, observatione gentium : hæc supplices attingunt ; hæc, ut aras, adorant ; fortasse quia ipsis inest vitalitas. • By all nations a sort of re ligious veneration is paid to the knees of men ; these the suppliants endea vour to touch ; these they adore in the same manner as they do the altars of the gods ; perhaps because there is a sort of lively vigour in them .' Sometimes they touch the knees with one hand, and the head or hands with the other . 10
Sometimes they kissed the hands and knees. Priam in Homer is intro duced touching the knees of Achilles, and kissing his hands ;11 and Ulysses reports, that himself, when a suppliant to the king of Egypt, touched and kissed his knees. 12
If the petitioners were very fearful, and the persons to whom they addressed themselves of very great quality , they kissed their feet. This kiss the Romans called labratum , and the old Gloss renders it píanpa

βασιλικών , ή ασπαστικών βασιλέως , α kiss of a king . Sometimes they kissed their own hands, and with them touched the person . Another sort of salutation by which they did homage to the gods, consisted in putting the
forefinger over the thumb ( perhaps upon the middle joint, which they used in counting the number ten ), and then giving a turn on their right hand .' Sometimes they prostrated themselves at the entrance of the temples
and kissed the sacred threshold. So generally was this custom of kissing
practised by supplicants, that the word spooruvsīv, to adore, is supposed to be derived from xúev, to kiss.
Another mode of supplicating consisted in pulling the hairs off their head, and offering them to the person to whom they prayed. After this
manner did Agamemnon present himself before Jupiter, when Hector had
given the Greeks an overthrow ."
They often clothed themselves with rags, or put on the habit of mourn ers , to move pity and compassion . The postures they used were various. Sometimes they prayed standing,
sometimes sitting, but generally kneeling, because that seems to bear the greatest show of humility ; whence the words yourélsodui, yovutita ), and
such like, signify to pray , or make supplication. Prostration was almost as frequent as kneeling. The poets furnish us with innumerable examples of prostration before the images, altars, and sometimes the thresholds of
the temples . Lucretius ridicules the practice, and denies that it is an act of piety,
- procumbere humi prostratum , etpandere palmas To fall down prostrate at a senseless shrine,
And
with

Before

The
Greek
scholiast
upon
Pindar
tells
us
,
they
were
wont
to
turn
their
faces
towards
the
east
,
when
they
prayed
to
the
gods
;
and
to
the
west
,
when
to
the
heroes
or
demigods
.
Others
say
,
they
always
kept
their
faces
towards
the
sun
;'
that
in
the
morning
they
turned
themselves
to
the
east
,
at
noon
to
the
south
,
and
in
the
evening
to

OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE . 239
enough , and told the calamity of the supplicant more movingly than a thousand orations,
The Molossians had a peculiar manner of supplicating, different from that of all other countries; which was practised by Themistocles when he
was pursued by the Athenians and Lacedæmonians, and forced to cast himself on the protection of Admetus, king of that country ; he held the young prince, who was then a child, in his arms, and in that posture pro strated himself before the king's household gods; this being the most sacred manner of supplication among the Molossians, and which was not to be
rejected.2 .
They that fled to the gods for refuge or help, used first to crown the altars with garlands, and then to make known their desires to the deity.' It was usual also to take hold of the altars . Whence Varro is of opinion,
that altars were called are , q. anse , which word is used to signify any thing that may be taken hold of. It was also an usual gesture in praying, to lift up their hands toward heaven . Πάνσις άνθρωποι ανατείνομεν τας χείρας εις τον ουρανόν εύχας ποιούμενοι" we all lift up our hands to heaven when we pray , says Aristotle . The same is affirmed by Helena in her prayer to Juno :6
- έρθάς ωλένας πρός ουρανός Relieve, we suppliant beg thee, stretching thus "Ριττούν , ίν ' οικείς αστέρων ποικίλματα . Our hands to yon star-spangled sky, thy seat, Goddess rever'd ! two wretches from their woes
Whence it appears, that the reason of lifting up their hands was, that they might hold them towards the gods, whose 'habitation is in heaven. Homer
everywhere mentions this posture, always adding xcīgas ávaoxày, when he speaks of any one that prayed to the gods. And this custom was so uni
versally received, that the holding up of hands is sometimes used to signify praying.' On the contrary, because the infernal gods were supposed to have their habitation beneath the earth , it was usual to pray to them with hands pointed downwards. Sometimes, the better to excite the attention of these gods, they stamped the ground with their feet. This is said to have been done by the actors, when they pronounced these words of He
cuba , wherein she invokes the assistance of the infernal gods to save her son Polydorus :8
* Ω χθόνιοι Θεοί , σώσατε παϊδ' εμόν.
Whence Cleanthem , cum pede terram percussisset, versum ex Epigonis divisse ferunt : “ It is reported of Cleanthes, that having first stamped the ground with his foot, he recited the following verse out of the Epigoni:'9 Audime hæc, Amphiarai, sub terranabdite !
When they lay prostrate or kneeled upon the earth, it was customary to beat it with their hands.10

Lastly, they who prayed to the deities of the sea expanded their hands towards the sea. This we find done by Achilles in Homer, when he in vokes Thetis ;' as likewise by Cloanthus in Virgil:2 These customs are briefly explained by the scholiast on the forementioned verses of Homer's
ninth Iliad : Εύχονται δε οι ήρωες τους μεν ουρανίοις θεοίς, άνω τάς,
Χείρας ανασχόντες μέγα εύχετόωντο έκαστος..
The heroes pray to the celestial gods, lifting up their hands to heaven , as in the verse there cited. Tois de Jaraocions, to the gods of the sea , they
prayed thus :

Lastly, it was a common opinion , that their prayers were more prevalent and successful , when offered in a barbarous and unknown language: and
the reason assigned for it was, that the first and native languages of man
kind, though barbarous and uncouth , yet consisted of words and names more agreeable to nature.5 Whence it was customary for magicians, and
those who pretended to have a more intimate familiarity with the gods than other men, to make their petitions in barbarous and unknown sounds .
Sometimes if they obtained their request, and it was a matter of conse
quence , they presented to the god some rich gift, or offered a sacrifice in thankfulness for the benefit they had received ; sometimes they related it to the priest of the temple, that it might be registered, as a testimony of the goodness of the gods and their readiness to hear the petitions of mor tals, and send them relief ; and for an encouragement to men to make

known their wants and desires to the deities, and to expect assistance
from them : on which account, as Eustathius has observed, all prayers in Homer, the petitions of which are just and reasonable, are rewarded with a full and satisfactory answer .
The imprecations of the Greeks were extremely terrible, being thought so powerful, when duly pronounced, as to occasion the destruction , not only of single persons, but of whole families and cities. The miseries
which befell Atreus, Agamemnon , and others of that family, were thought
to proceed from the imprecations of Myrtilus upon Pelops their ancestor, by whom he was thrown into the sea. Thus Lycophron :
Φερωνύμους έδυψε Νηρέως τάφους,, Πανώλεθρον κηλίδα θωύξας γένει ..
The same imprecations are likewise mentioned in the Electra of Sopho
cles, and the Orestes of Euripides. Though by others the calamities of
that family are ascribed to the curses of Thyestes, Atreus' brother ; whence Thyesteæ preces are used proverbially for any dreadful impreca tions2
But the most dreadful imprecations were those pronounced by parents, priests, kings, prophets, or other sacred persons. Examples whereof may be found in Homer's ninth Iliad, where Phoenix relates, that the gods would not permit him to have children, by reason of his father's impreca
tions: and afterwards that Meleager was destroyed by the curses of his mother. Hence it was customary for men condemned for any notorious crime, to be publicly cursed by the priests. This befell Alcibiades, against
whom, besides banishment and confiscation , the Athenians decreed that he should be cursed by all the priests and priestesses. Which decree was
obeyed by all who then held that office, except Theano, who professed her
self to be by her office of priesthood appointed to bless, and not to curse. There is likewise frequent mention of imprecations in the Roman affairs and authors. Thus, when Crassus undertook that fatal expedition
against the Parthians, wherein he perished , Ateius running to the gate of the city, placed there a vessel full of burning coals, upon which he offered
odours and libations, and pronounced most dreadful curses against Crassus, as he passed by. And we are informed by Pliny, 6 that diris depreca
tionibus defigi, nemo non metuit: “ All men are afraid of imprecations; there being no way to avoid or expiate their direful effects .? That the same practice was used in other parts of the world, appears
from the sacred writings: in which Jonathan , after he had gained a glorious victory over the enemies of his country, is reported to have been reduced to the last extremity by the imprecations of Saul , his father and
king. And Joshua is said to have pronounced a solemn curse upon the person who should rebuild Jericho ;9 which was fulfilled upon Hiel many

ages after.? Balaam the magician was sent for by Balak, king of Moab,
to corse his enemies the Israelites . The patriarch Jacob is introduced distributing his blessings to some of his children , a custom no less ancient than the other ; and his curses to Reuben, Simeon, and Levi. Noah ,
the father of a new world, pronounced an imprecation upon his grandson Canaan ," which had its effect a long time after. And the practice seems
to have been derived from the curses pronounced by God upon Adam , and
afterwards upon Cain .
CHAP. VI.
OF THE GRECIAN OATHS.
Having described the manner of offering sacrifices and prayers to the
gods, I shall proceed, in the next place, to speak of the honour paid to them, by using their names in solemn contracts, promises, and assevera tions ; and calling them to witness men's truth and honesty, or to punish their falsehood and treachery. This was reputed a sort of religious adora tion , being an acknowledgment of the omnipotence, and omnipresence, and by consequence, of the divinity of the person thus invoked. Whence
the poets describe men's reception into the number of the gods by their being invoked in oaths: thus Horace speaks of Cæsar,5 and Lucan of the Roman heroes, who sacrificed their lives in the civil wars . Adrastus in
Statius compliments the ghost of Archemorus in the same manner. And
the inspired writers, for the same reason , forbid to swear by the pagan deities, and command to swear by the true God . Thus in Deuteronomy: ' Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , and serve him , and shalt swear by his name.'8 And in Jeremiah : How shall I pardon thee for this ? thy
children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods." And, to forbear other instances, the worshippers of the true God are by David described by swearing by him.10
" Ogros, the god of oaths, is said to have been the son of Eris, or Con tention ;ll and fables tell us, that in the golden age, when men were strict observers of the laws of truth and justice, there was no occasion for oaths,
nor any use made of them : but when they began to degenerate from their primitive simplicity , when truth and justice were banished out of the
earth , when every one began to make advantage of his neighbour by
cozenage and deceit, and there was no trust to be placed in any man's word , it was high time to think of some expedient whereby they might

secure themselves from the fraud and falsehood of one another. Hence had oaths their origin. We are told indeed, that Chiron first invented oaths; but the meaning of that seems only to be this ; that he first reduced
some of the barbarous nations to a sense of religion and virtue : whence it
is added in the same place, that he taught them δικαιοσύνην, και θυσίας inapàs, justice and propitiatory sucrifices. However that be, it is proba
ble, that at first oaths were only used upon weighty and momentous occasions, yet in process of time they came to be applied to every trivial matter, and in common discourse, which has given occasion to the dis
tinction of oaths into that which was called 'O péroes, and used only on solemn and weighty accounts ; and that which they termed 'o pixgos, which was taken in things of the smallest moment, and was sometimes used merely as an expletive to fill up a sentence, and make a round and
emphatical period. Some there are that tell us, the péyas ögxos, was that
wherein the gods, pesregós that wherein creatures were called to witness ;, but the falsity of this distinction evidently appears by a great many in
stances, of which I shall only mention one, namely, that of the Arcadians, amongst whom the most sacred and inviolable oath was taken by the water of a fountain called Styx, near Nonacris, a city , or, according to others, a mountain in Arcadia ; upon which account it was, that Cleomenes the
Lacedæmonian, to secure the fidelity of the Arcadians, had a design to carry the principal men among them to Nonacris, and there to make them
swear by this fountain , though they had taken another oath before, as my author 3 hath related . It will not be wholly impertinent in this place to
mention the great oath of the gods by the Stygian lake : for Jupiter, Αυτήν μεν γαρ 3θηκε θεών μέγαν εμμέναι όρκον .. Ordain'd this lake a solemn oath should be

Jupiter was thought more especially to preside over oaths ; though all
the gods seem to have been concerned in them , for it was usual to swear by them all, or any of them ; and of any injured person it was said, in general, that he had offended the gods ; but they were thought chiefly, and
more peculiarly to belong to Jupiter's care ; and though perhaps this may
not appear, as some think it does, from the word jusjurandum , which they will have to be so called q. Jovis jurandum , yet it will sufficiently
be proved by the plain testimony of the poet,5

And Jove, who over human oaths presides.

The gods, by whom Solon commanded the Athenians chiefly to swear
in public causes, were three ,' namely, ' Iréoios, Kabégoros, and 'Egaztotágios, or rather one Jupiter " Ogros, by three names, though some make them to be three distinct gods. Plato, in his Euthydemus mentions Apollo, Mi nerva, and Jupiter. Demosthenes also, in his oration against Midias, swears by the same three deities : but in that against Timocrates he takes
an oath by Jupiter, Neptune, and Ceres. And the Athenians very often swore by other gods; sometimes by all the gods in general, sometimes by
the twelve great gods, as μα τους δώδεκα θεούς ; the Spartans usually μα τω Zw, by Castor, and Pollux. The women's oaths, were commonly by
Juno, Diana, or Venus, or on the Jew, i. e. by Ceres and Proserpine, which were appropriated to the female sex,2 and never used by men except in imitation of the women. Not that these were the only oaths used by
women, but they were the most usual, though they often swore by other god desses, and sometimes by the gods.
Men generally swore by the god to whom the business they had in
hand, or the place in which they were , belonged ; in the market they usu ally swore by 'Equins erogaños, or Mercury ; ploughmen, by Ceres ; those that delighted in horses, by Neptune. The Athenians 3 alone of all the
Greeks used to swear by Isis, and the Thebans commonly by Osiris.
Sometimes, either out of haste, or assurance of their being in the right, or some such reason , they swore indefinitely by any of the gods, in this
manner : " Operopes peiv Tina Tūv Jewel Others, thinking it unlawful to use the name of god upon every slight occasion, said no more than Næi ke tör,
or By, &c., by a religious ellipsis omitting the name. Suidas mentions
this custom, which, says he, gu @mišu após svośßscay, inures men to a pious
regard for the name of god .“ Isocrates, in Stobæus, forbids to swear by any of the gods in any suit of law about money , and only allows it on two
accounts, ή σαυτόν αιτίας αισχράς απολύων, ή φίλους και μεγάλων κινδύνων dramálav, either to vindicate yourself from the imputation of some wicked ness , or deliver your friendsfrom some great danger. To which Simpli cius, in his commentary upon Epictetus, adds a third, namely, to obtuin some considerable benefitfor your country. Pythagoras; was very cautious
in this matter, for he rarely swore by the gods himself, or allowed his scholars to do so ; instead of the gods, he advised them to swear by Tax
Tetpáxtuy, or the numberfour,8 as thinking the perfection of the soul con sisted in this number, there being in every soul, a mind, science , opinion,
and sense . And it is reported of Clinias, the Pythagorean, that when he might have cleared himself from a fine of three talents, he rather chose to pay that sum than to take an oath. Socrates told his scholars, that Rhada

manthus, the justest man that ever lived, had expressly forbidden men to swear by the gods, but instead of them , allowed the use of a dog, goose ,
ram , or such like creatures ; and in conformity to this rule, that philoso . pher was wont to swear m Tòn xúva , xñve , or trátavos, by a dog, goose,
or plane -tree. Zeno, the father of the stoics, usually swore v thy xárta pin, i. e. by a shrub that bears capers. In Ananius, one swears by crambe,
i. e, colewort;' the same oath occurs in Teleclides, Epicharmus, and
Eupolis, and it seems to have been used more especially among the Ioni ans. By which instances it appears, that though the custom of swearing
upon light and frivolous occasions was very common amongst the Greeks, as may be seen in their comedies and other interlocutory discourses, yet
the more wise and considerate sort entertained a most religious regard for oaths. Sometimes they seem entirely to forbid all sorts of oaths, whether just or unjust. To which purpose is that saying of Menander :
• " Ορκον δε φεύγε, κάν δικαίως ομνύης
And another of Choerilus:
" Όρκον τ’ ούτ' άδικον χρεών έμμεναι, ούτε δίκαιον.
And, to mention no more examples, the scholiast upon Homer informs us, that the ancient Greeks did not προπετώς κατά των θεών ομνύναι, αλλά κατά
Tâv sportuyxayórtwy, rashly, and in common discourse, swear by the gods, but made use of other things. The same words oceur also in Suidas.2 Sometimes they swore by the ground they stood upon ;9 sometimes by
rivers, fountains, floods, the elements, sun, moon, and stars, all which they
accounted very sacred oaths. Sometimes by anything they made use of, as a fisherman by his nets, a soldier by his spear ; and this last was a very
great oath, if it be true, that the ancients paid divine worship to this weapon ; in memory of which, in later ages , it was usual for the statues of the gods to hold a spear : and Eustathius writes, that Cæneus erected a
spear, and commanded that it should be worshipped as a god . Kings and
princes usually swore by their sceptres, as we find everywhere in Homer ; and this also 'was thought a solemn oath , because the sceptre is a badge
and ensign of regal and judicial power. They swore also by men ; sometimes by the dead, of which Demos
thenes is a famous instance, who, in an oration to the people of Athens, swore by toùs in Magalwrı, those that valiantly lost their lives in the battle
of Marathon ; sometimes by the living, and this was done either by their
Zwangia, health and safety ; or "Aayea, their misfortunes ; or their names ; or some of their members, as their eyes, right hand, especially their head,
which was accounted a very solemn oath, either because the head was
accounted the principal and most noble part of man ; or,' because it was the hieroglyphic of health.

246 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
Sometimes they swore by those who were dearest to them, as parents , children , or those for whom they had a high esteem ; so thePythagoreans used
to swear by their master Pythagoras ; nor did they this as thinking him a god or hero, but because he was a person whose memory they thought deserving of great veneration , and whose merits had exalted him to a near affinity with the divine nature .
The manner of taking oaths was sometimes by lifting up their hands to
heaven ; whence Apollo, in the poet, bids Lachesis xsīgas kruttivat. though some are of opinion that this custom was of a later origin . Some times in the péyas ögzos, or great and solemn oath, they laid their hands upon the altar, as appears from that saying of Pericles, who, being desired
by a friend to take a false oath upon his account, replied, that he was his friend to the altars, and no farther; as likewise from the story reported by Diogenes Laërtius, of Xenocrates, who, being a man eminent for a strict and virtuous life, was summoned as a witness in a certain cause, where,
having spoken what he knew of the matter, he went to the altar to confirm
his evidence by oath ; but the judges, well knowing the integrity of the man , with unanimous consent bid him forbear, and gave credit to him upon
his bare word . Lastly, to pass by other examples, the same rite is observed in Virgil, at the celebrated league between Latinus and Æneas ;'
Tango aras, mediosque ignes et numina testor : Whatever chance befall on either side, Nulla dies pacem hanc Italis etfudera rumpet. I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames, And all those powers attest, and all their names :
Instead of the altar 2 they sometimes made use of a stone ; this fact is recorded by Suidas, who has taken it out of Aristotle and Philochorus, and for a farther confirmation of it, has cited these words out of the oration of
Demosthenes against Conon : Tών τε παρόντων καθ ένα ημών ούτωσι προς
Tùy ridor äroutes, xaà lžogxbūvtis * i. e, and bringing all us who were present, one by one, to the stone, and there administering the oath to us. What is
meant by this stone, the scholiast upon Aristophanes has informed us in his comment upon this verse :
Τονθορίζοντες δε γήρα τω λίθω προσέσταμεν.. With mutterings near tribunals still approach We, though depressed with age,
Where he tells us, that by aídos is meant the Bñud, or the tribunal, in Pnyx, a public place where the Athenian assemblies used to meet. And
the reason why it is so called, he gives in another place, where the come
dian calls it airge, a stone, because it stood upon a rock ; whence artwó Tas, are those that took or imposed an oath in Pnyx. Instead of the altar, in private contracts, the person swearing, according to the Roman fashion , laid his hand upon the hand of the party to whom he swore.'
In all compacts and agreements it was usual to take each other by the hand , that being the manner of plighting faith ; and this was done, either

of
the

they
had
to
the
number
ten
,
as
some
say
,
there
being
ten
fingers
on
the
two
hands
;
or
because
such
a
junction
was
a
token
of
amity
and
concord
;
whence
,
at
all
friendly
meetings
,
they
joined
hands
,
as
a
design
of
the
union
of
their
souls.
And
the
right
hand
seems
to
have
been
used
rather
than
the
left,
because
it
was
more
honourable
,
as
be
ing
the
instrument
by
which
superiors
give
commands
to
those
below
them
.
Besides
this
,
in
all
solemn

they

to
the

by
whom
they
swore
,
offering
,
for

part
,
either
a
boar,
ram
,
or

;
sometimes
all

;
sometimes
bulls

Sometimes
they
cut
out
the
testicles
of
the
victim
,
and
took
the
oath
standing
upon
them
.
A
ram
or
boar
thus
used
is
properly
called
Topics.
The
ceremonies
were
thus
:
they
first
cut
some
of
the
hair
off
the
victim's
head
,
and
gave
part
of
it
to
all
present
,
that
all
might
share
in
the
oath
,
After
this
they
invoked
the
gods
to
be
witnesses
of
their
agreement,
and
to
punish
the
person
that
should
first
violate
his
oath
.
This
done
,
they
killed
the
victims
by
cutting
their
throats
:

the
phrase

This
done
,
they
repeated
the
form
of
words
,
which
both
parties
were
to
confirm
with
mutual
oaths
,
as
appears
from
Homer's
description
of
the
truce
made
be
.
tween
the
Grecians
and
Trojans.
After
this
they
made
a
libation
of
wine
,
which
was
at
this
time
mixed
,
to
siguify
the
conjunction
and
concord
between
the
parties;
then
praying
again
to
the
gods
,
they
poured
it
forth
,
requesting
,
that
whoever
should
first
break
his
oath
might
have
his
blood
or
brains
poured
out
in
the
same
manner. It
was
very
usual
to
add
a
solemn
imprecation
to
their
oaths
,
which
was
done
either
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
person
by
whom
the
oath
was

or
to
lay
a

unlawful to be eaten ; and therefore, if the person concerned was at home, it was buried ; for so Priam seems to have done with his victims in the
sacrifices before mentioned ; but if the party was a stranger, they threw it into the sea, as Talthybius did the sow , which was sacrificed at one of
Agamemnon's oaths, or disposed of it in some other way. If any unlucky
or ominous accident happened at the time of sacrifice, they usually deferred, or wholly refused to take the oath ; thus when Pyrrhus, Lysimachus, and
Cassander, had concluded a peace, and met to confirm it by solemn oath and sacrifice, a goat, bull, and ram , being brought out, the ram on a sud
den fell down dead , which some only laughed at ; but Theodotus the priest forbade Pyrrhus to swear, declaring that heaven, by that omen, portended the death of one of the three kings, whereupon he refused to ratify the peace.
Another manner of swearing was this: they took hold oftheir garments , and pointing a sword towards their throats, invoked the heavens, earth , sun , and Furies, to bear witness to what they were about to do ; they then
sacrificed a boar-pig, which they cast into the sea ; and this being done they took the oath .
The solemn way of taking an oath amongst the Molossians, was, by cutting an ox into small pieces, and then swearing ; whence any thing
divided into small parcels was proverbially called Bows ó Mohortây. Eras mus, instead of bos Molottorum , writes bos Homolottorum , reading Bows “Ομολοστών instead of βούς ο Μολοστών .
Another manner of swearing was that described by Plutarch, who re ports, that when the Grecians had overthrown and utterly routed all the forces of Xerxes, being flushed with victory, they entered upon a design of making a common invasion upon Persia ; whereupon, to keep them firm to their resolutions, Aristides made them all swear to keep the league, and himself took the oath in name of the Athenians, and after curses pro
nounced against him that should break the vow, threw wedges of red -hot iron into the sea ; by which was signified that the oath should remain in
violable, as long as the irons should abide in the sea without swimming; which custom is also mentioned by Callimachus.' There is also another manner of swearing, mentioned by Plutarch in the life of Dion, which Dion's wife and sister imposed upon Callippus the
Athenian, being moved thereto by a suspicion that he was privy to a con
spiracy against Dion's life. It was thus : the juror went into the temple of Ceres and Proserpine, or, as some say, of Ceres Thesmophorus, or the lawgiver, where, after the performance of certain ceremonies, he was clothed in the purple vestment of the goddess, and holding a lighted torch in his hand, as being in the presence of the deity, took the oath by all the

gods in the world ; this the Syracusans accounted the most solemn and sacred oath that could be.
Another test the Sicilians generally made use of at Palice, a city of Sicily , where was a fountain named Acadinus, to which the jurors came,
and having written the oath in a tablet, threw it into the water, wherein , if it could swim , the person accused was believed honest ; but if it sunk , he was immediately to be cast into the flames which issued from the foun tain .'
They had also other methods of clearing themselves from the imputation
of crimes. As when the person accused creeped upon his hands through
the fire; or held in his hands red-hot iron, called in Greek Múdpos; which was done by the innocent without any sense of pain . Thus one in Sopho cles 3 tells Creon , that all the guards were ready to take upon oath, that they neither buried Polynices themselves, nor knew who had done it :
"Hμεν δ' έτοιμοι και μύδρους αίρειν χερούν, 'The mass of burning iron in our hands Και πύρ αέρπειν, κατά θεούς ορκωμοτείν

A custom not much differing from these was practised in this island by our Saxon ancestors upon the same account, and was therefore called the fire-ordeal," for ordeal in Saxon signifies purgation . The manner of under
going this test was thus : the person accused passed blindfold, with bare
ftet, over certain ploughshares made red-hot, and placed at an equal dis tance from one another. This ordalium Edward the Confessor forced his
mother Emma to undergo, to vindicate her honour from the scandal of incontinency with Alwayne bishop of Winchester ; and by this trial she
gave a sufficient demonstration of her innocence ; for having passed over the iron before she was aware of it, she cried out, When shall I come to
the place of my purgation ? and Cunigunda, the wife of the emperor Henry the Second , upon the like imputation, held a red -hot iron in her
hand, and received no harm thereby. I shall mention but one sort more of these purgation - oaths, which is
described by Achilles Tatius in the eighth book of his Erotic Romance, The Loves of Clitophon and Leucippe. It is this: when a woman' was accused of incontinency, she was to clear herself from this charge by oath, which was written in a tablet, and hung about her neck ; then she went
into the water up to the mid-leg, where, if she was innocent, all things remained in the same manner as they were before ; but if guilty, the very water swelled, as it were, with rage, mounted up as high as her neck, and covered the tablet, lest so horrid and detestable a sight, as a false oath, should be exposed to the view of the sun and the world .

What a religious regard they had foroaths appears from this, that scogxo;, or one that keeps his oaths, is commonly used for svoeßns, a pious person . On the contrary, when they would express a wicked forlorn wretch, they called him śríuqxos, perjurious ; which was the worst and most infamous title
they could fix upon him ; whence Aristophanes,2 speaking of Jupiter's lightning and thunderbolts, which, as some thought, were chiefly levelled against the wicked, says, Ernie Bárde tous étioqxous, if perjured villains
are indeed so liable to the stroke, how comes it to pass that Cleonymus and
Theodorus escape so well ? or that the poor oak is so often shattered to
pieces, ou yde digūs strogxsī, since it can never be perjured ? Such as were common and customary swearers, the Athenians branded with the name
of Ardetti , from ' Apdortòs, the name of the place wherein oaths were re quired of them, before their admission to public offices.
False swearers were, in some places, punished with death : in others,
they suffered the same punishment that was due to the crime with which they charged any innocent person ; in others, only a pecuniary mulct. But though they sometimes escaped human punishment, yet it was thought the divine vengeance would not fail to overtake them, and the dæmons
always pretended an utter abhorrence of such enormous crimes, of which there is a remarkable instance related by Herodotus . There was at Sparta
a man named Glaucus, famed over all Greece for his justice and integrity : into his hands a certain Milesian, fearing some danger at home, and being
encouraged by the character of the man , deposited a large sum of money . After some time the sons of this Milesian came to Sparta, and showing
Glaucus the bill, demanded the money. Glaucus pretended he was wholly ignorant of the matter, yet promised to recollect with himself, and if he
found any thing due to them, to pay it. To do this he took four months'
time ; and having gained this delay, immediately took a journey to Delphi, on purpose to ask Apollo's opinion , whether it was lawful to perjure him
self, thereby to secure the money ? The god , moved with indignation at the impudence of the man, returned him this answer :
Perfidious oaths, and violated faith ,

This prediction was fully accomplished in Glaucus, notwithstanding he afterwards restored the money ; for his whole family was in a few genera tions utterly extinct, and so became a memorable example of divine ven
geance . But though all the other gods took upon them sometimes to punish this crime, yet it was thought in a more peculiar manner to be the
care of Jupiter, surnamed " Ooxlos. And Pausanias reports, that in the
Boudsurácios, or council hall, at Olympia, there was a statue of Jupiter

E. D.
Yet some in that place read xapeóvres, and then the meaning of it will be, that the souls of deceased persons are employed in torturing perjured villains.
In some places even insensible creatures were thought to take revenge for this crime ; for it was generally believed in Arcadia, that no man could forswear himself by the waters of Styx, without undergoing some severe and remarkable punishment; and it is reported of the subterranean cavern ,
sacred to Palæmon at Corinth, that no perjured person could so much as enter into it without being made a memorable example of divine justice. In Sicily, at the temple of the Palici in the city Palice, there were certain crateres, fonts, or lakes, for so they were sometimes called, named Delli, out of which flames and balls of fire, with boiling and stinking water
coutinually issued ; and thither people used to resort from all quarters, for the deciding of controversies. If any one swore falsely near these
fonts, he was presently struck either blind, lame, or dead , on the spot ; or was swallowed up, and drowned in the lakes. But of these mention has already been made.3
Notwithstanding these, and other instances of the divine displeasure at this crime, and the scandal and infamy of it, yet was it so much practised
by the Grecians, that they could never avoid the imputation of treachery
and perfidiousness, insomuch that Græca fides came to be proverbially applied to men that were wavering, inconstant, and unfit to be trusted .
Plautus,' by Græca fide mercari, means to buy with ready money, as though without that a Grecian was not to be meddled with . Cicero speaks
after the same manner : ' that nation ,' says he, ' never made any conscience of observing their oaths.' Their own countryman , Euripides, affirms no

And Polybius yet more fully in the sixth book of his history : amongst the Greeks,' says he, ' if you lend only one talent, and for security have ten bonds, with as many seals, and double the number of witnesses, yet all these obligations can scarcely force them to be honest .' Yet Ausonius had
a better opinion of them , unless his words were irony and ridicule, when he said to Paulus,
Nobiscum invenies watavba, si libet uti At my house, too, if you will honest be, Non Pæna, sed Groca fide. A wapton muse's trifles you may see.
The Thessalians in particular were infamous for this vice ; whence, by
Osooanão vócsopece, is meant fraud and deceit; and the other proverb, namely, Osttadãv cópiona, seems to have had its rise from the treacher
ous and double dealing of the Thessalians with their confederates ; a
memorable instance of which we have in the Peloponnesian war , where, in the midst of a battle , they turned sides, and deserting the Athenians,
went over to the Lacedæmonians ; which reason seems more probable than that mentioned by Zenodotus, namely, their solemn vow of a hecatomb of
men made every year to Apollo, without any design of ever paying it ; which they did in imitation of their forefather Thessalus, who made such à vow to Apollo, but considering how impious and unpleasing to the god
it was like to be, negleeted the performance of it. The Locrians were no
less infamous on the same account, whence those proverbial sayings, nox
ροι τας συνθήκας, and Λοκρών σύνθημα , usually denote fraudulent persons and practices. And the Lacedæmonians, as they were the most renowned of all the Grecians for their valour, temperance, and other virtues, so were
the most scandalous for their treachery , and contempt of oaths ; whence they are called Ainóros, i.e. Vsūotal xaà Sóro, liars and deceitful ; and Σπάρτης ένοικοι , δόλια βουλεύματα. Spartans, fam'd ever for base treacheries,
and are said to have accounted as sacred neither altars, promises, nor oaths. And that this was no calumny, may farther appear from the apho
rism of Lysander, one of the most eminent generals: ' Eğanutęy xan παϊδας μεν αστραγάλους, πολεμίους δε Xors' Boys, said he, are to be
deceived with dice, but enemies with oaths. Though others will have this
to be the saying of Dionysius the tyrant . However that be , it is certain the Lacedæmonians, though perhaps more just and punctual in private affairs, had very little regard for oaths in public business. Their great
Agesilaus seems to have thought it but a weak obligation , whenever it stood in competition with the public good, that great mark to which they thought all their actions were to be directed, insomuch that, as Plutarch
affirms," to serve their country was the principle and spring of all their actions; nor did they account any thing just or unjust, by any measures but that.

appear from the story of Themistocles in Plutarch ; for he, telling the people he had formed a design, which , if accomplished , would be very advantageous to the commonwealth , but might not at this time be com
municated to the whole assembly ; they ordered him to impart it to Aris tides in private, who, having heard the matter, came and reported to the
people that it was indeed a very beneficial contrivance, but withal the
most unjust in the world ; whereupon they immediately commanded The mistocles to desist from his intention . Diogenian, in his book of collections,
tells us, that ' Afrixòs págtus, was taken for a sincere and uncorrupt wit ness ; as also 'Attixn ziotis, for a true, honest, and untainted faith ; and
though some would have this proverb taken from the goddess Fides, who had a temple at Athens, and others, not from the manners of the people, but the nature of their soil, which was so unfruitful, that it brought forth just as much as was sown and no more ; whence Attica fides is applied to any
man that restores all that he was entrusted with ; yet Velleius Paterculus?
assures us it was taken from their faithfulness and unshaken loyalty to the
Romans; whence Attica fides is by Flaccus called certa : by Horace * impolluta ; and by Silius 6 pura . Notwithstanding this, their honesty
was not so firm but that it might sometimes be shaken by the alluring and specious temptation of the public good. I will mention one instance of this, which is the more remarkable, and more clearly evidences the dis
position and temper of that state, because it was approved by the consent of the people, and put in execution by Aristides, a man of greater renown for justice and upright dealing than any that city ever brought forth . He, when the Grecians, after they had utterly routed all the remainder of Xerxes' numerous army, designed a common invasion upon Persia, took, a solemn oath in the name of the Athenians, to observe the league; but
afterwards, when things were brought to such a pass as constrained them to govern with a stronger hand than was consistent with it, advised them
to throw the perjury upon him, and manage affairs as their convenience
required . Upon the whole matter, Theophrastus tells us that this person was, in his own private atfairs, and those of his fellow - citizens, nicely just ; but in public matters did many things according to the state and condition
of his country, for whose sake he frequently committed acts of injustice. Then he adds, that it was reported of him , that to one who was in debate, whether he should convey a certain treasure from Delos to Athens, con trary to the league, at the persuasion of the Samians, he should say, ' that the thing was not just, but expedient,

OF THE GRECIAN DIVINATION, AND ORACLES IN GENERAL.'
It was a received opinion in all ages, that the gods were wont to converse
familiarly with some men , whom they endowed with extraordinary powers, and admitted to the knowledge of their counsels and designs.

all sorts of divination , and signifies the knowledge of things obscure, or future, which cannot be attained by any ordinary or natural means.

dreamers, but the interpreters of dreams, were the diviners; and that their skill was the effect of art and observation, is evident from the many books written upon that subject, and the various signs delivered in them to make conjectures by : in like manner, it was not so much the business of an augur to see the birds of divination , which might casually happen to any rude and unskilful person, but after he had seen them, to interpret what was portended by them .
These, therefore, with others of the like nature, are to be referred to
the second species of divination , called regroxn, or artificial, because it was not obtained by immediate inspiration, but was the effect of experi ence and observation , as soothsaying: or depended chiefly upon human art, invention , or imposition ; which, nevertheless, was not supposed to be altogether destitute of divine direction and concurrence : such was divina tion by lots. I shall begin with the first sort of divination , as having a more imme
diate dependence on the gods: and first with the noblest part of it, I mean Oracles , which are called in Greek χρησμοί, χρησμωδίαι, χρησμωδήματα,
μαντεύματα , θεοτρόπια , θεσπίσματα , θεσφάτα, &c. The interpreters, or revealers, of oracles, xenouodóyo, &c. The consulters, Jeorgóros, &c.
The places in which they were delivered, xenotígid , paytila, &c. Some of these names were also applied to other sorts of divination.

what great esteem oracles were in , at least among the vulgar, when law givers, and men of the greatest authority, were forced to make use of
these methods to win them into compliance. Nay, we are informed , that inspired persons were thought worthy of the greatest honour and trusts ; insomuch that sometimes we find them advanced to the throne, and invested with regal power ; because, being admitted to the counsels of the gods, they were best able to provide for the safety and welfare of man kind.
This reputation stood the priests, who had their dependence on the ora cles, in no small stead ; for finding their credit thus thoroughly established, they allowed no man to consult the gods, before he had offered costly sacri
fices, and made rich presents to them : whereby it came to pass, that few besides great and wealthy men were admitted to ask their advice, the rest
being unable to defray the charges required on that account, which con tributed very much to raise the esteem of oracles among the common people, men generally being apt to admire the things they are kept at some distance from , and on the other hand, to contemn what they are familiarly acquainted with. Wherefore, to keep up their esteem with the better sort, even they were only admitted upon a few stated days: at other
times, neither the greatest prince could purchase, nor persons of the greatest quality anywise obtain an answer . Alexander himself was peremptorily
denied by the Pythia, till she was by downright force compelled to ascend the tripos, when, finding herself unable to resist any longer, she cried out ' Avíxntos sl, thou art invincible ; which words were thought a very lucky omen, and accepted instead of a further oracle.
As to the causes of oracles, it has been disputed whether they were the revelations of demons, or only the delusions of crafty priests. Van Dale has composed a large treatise in defence of the latter opinion ; but his arguments are not of such force, but that they might, without difficulty, be refuted, if either my design required, or time permitted me to answer them . However that be, it was the common opinion that Jupiter was the
first cause of this and all other sorts of divination ; it was he that had the books of fate, and out of them revealed either more or less, as he pleased , to inferior demons ; for which reason he was surnamed IlevopeQuios .2
Of the other gods Apollo was reputed to bave the greatest skill in mak
1 Bishop Sherlock, in his dise and supported by human craft, tween them and the heathens, courses concerning the use and without any supernatural aid of yet they believed them at the intent of prophecy, expresses his interposition whatever.

ing predictions, and therefore it was one of his offices to preside over, and inspire all sorts of prophets and diviners ; but this was only in subordina
tion to Jupiter, and by converse with, and participation from him , as Æschylus 2 gives us to understand, when he says,
Στέλλειν όπως τάχιστα, ταύτα γαρ πατήρ Send, quickly send, for so by Jove inspir'd Ζεύς όγκαθοί Δοξία.
On the same account, in another place , when he brings in Apollo com
manding men to reverence his own oracles, he adds, they must also pay due respect to those of Jupiter, without mentioning any of the other pro phetic deities. Others report, that Apollo received the art of divination from Pan ;s others will have him instructed by Themis,“ others by Glau
cus.5 Lastly , some were of opinion , την Αφροδίτην Ουρανίαν είναι μητέρα
όλων, πάσης μαντείας και προγνώσεως ευρετήν, that the heavenly Venus μας the mother of the universe, and the inventor of all sorts of divination and
prognostication . The manner of delivering oracles was not in all places, nor at all times, the same : in some places, the gods revealed them by interpreters, as did
Apollo at Delphi; in others, more immediately, giving answers them selves, which they either pronounced viva voce , or returned by dreams, or lots (the former of which ere suppose to be inspired, and the latter
directed by the gods), or some other way . The oracles which the gods
themselves pronounced, were termed xenopoà cúrópwvor those which were delivered by interpreters, χρησμοί υποφητικοί. In some places several ways were used : for instance, they who consulted Trophonius, after hav
ing proposed their questions, first received an answer in a dream ; and, if
that was obscure, and hard to be understood, had the meaning of it inter preted by men kept for that purpose , and instructed in that art by the
deity. Several other ways also this god used to give answers to inquirers, as Pausanias reports in his description of Boeotia ; and in another place, the same author mentions these heroic verses, as spoken by Trophonius: Πρίν αορί συμβαλέειν εχθροίς, στήσασθε τρόπαιον , Till a distinguish'd trophy you erect, 'Ασπίδα κοσμήσαντες αμήν, την, είσατο νησ

CHAP. VIII .
OF THE ORACLES OF JUPITER.
1 Dodona 2 is by some thought to have been a city of Thessaly ; by others it was placed in Epirus; and others, to reconcile these two opinions, will
have two Dodonas, one in Thessaly , and another in Epirus. They that place it in Epirus (and that is generally believed to have been the seat of
the oracle, whether there was another Dodona in Thessaly or not), are no less divided in their opinions about it ; for some of them will have it in Thesprotia, others in Chaonia , or Molossia ; but Eustathius 3 has under
taken to decide the controversy , telling us that it did indeed once belong to the Thesprotians, but afterwards fell into the hands of the Molossians;
and he is herein confirmed by Strabo. It was first built by Deucalion, who, in that universal deluge, wherein the greatest part of Greece perished, retreated to this place, which hy reason of its height secured him from the waters. Hither resorted to him
all that had escaped from the inundation , with whom he peopled his new built city, calling it Dodona, either from a sea-nymph of that name, or
Dodon, the son, or Dodone the daughter of Jupiter and Europa ; or from the river Dodon , or Don : for so it is called by Stephanus; or as some
say, from Dodanim the son of Javan , who was captain of a colony sent to inhabit those parts of Epirus. At the same time, Deucalion is said to have founded a temple, which he consecrated to Jupiter, who is thence called Dodonæus. This was the first temple in Greece ; but the oracle seems to have been a considerable time before it ; for Herodotus, in the
second book of his history, reports, that it was the most ancient of all oracles in Greece, which would be false, had it not been before Deucalion's
time ; for he, as the poet tells us, having escaped the deluge , consulted the oracle of T'hemis on mount Parnassus, on what means he should use to

replenish the country with people ; and the same oracle is said to have
been jointly possessed by the Earth and Neptune, before it belonged to Themis ,
The origin of it, though, like all other things of such antiquity, wrapped
up in fables, I will repeat to you out of the forementioned place of Hero dotus, where he hath given us two accounts of it ; the first of which, he tells us, he received from the priests of Jupiter at Thebes in Egypt, which was this : that the Phoenicians had carried away two priestesses from that place, one of whom they sold into Libya, the other into Greece ; that each of these had erected the first oracle in those nations, the one of Jupiter
Ammon , the other of Jupiter Dodonæus. The other account was given him by the priestesses at Dodona, and confirmed by all those that minis
tered in the temple, namely, that two black pigeons taking their flight from Thebes in Egypt, one of them came to Libya, where she commanded that an oracle should be erected to Ammon ; the other to Dodona, where
she sat upon an oak -tree, and speaking with a human voice, ordered that there should be in that place an oracle of Jupiter. Afterwards, Herodotus
delivers his own opinion about the matter, which was this: that if the Phoenicians did really carry two women from Thebes, and sell one of
them in Libya, and the other in Greece, it might be probable that she that was transported into Greece was sold to the Thesprotians, in that country, which in his time was called Hellas, but formerly named Pelas gia, where she instituted the oracle to Jupiter, and gave instructions after what manner he was to be worshipped. To confirm this conjecture, he adds, that those two oracles have a near resemblance to each other. More
over, he tells us, the two women were said to be black, because they camu from Egypt, and were called doves, because their language was barbarous, and as unintelligible as that of birds; afterwards, when they had learned the Greek tongue, they were said to speak with a human voice. Eusta tathius 2 gives two reasons more for this appellation ; the first is, that they
were called nríasmus, or doves, q. Iliasiovávteis, because they made their predictions by the observation of those birds ; as they who made use of crows in divination were named Koparojecérosis. The other reason is, that

in the Molossian language, old women were called níasımı, and old men
Tí2.101, and those prophetesses being old women, either by a mistake of the word, or a poetical equivocation , were called doves ; and why aged
persons should be thus termed, the old scholiast upon Sophocles ' informs us ; for, says he, the three old prophetesses were called Tíasei, q. II !To howuévan, because of their grey hairs. Servius gives another reason ,' viz,
that in the Thessalian tongue, the word measiás is used to signify a pro phetess as well as a dove ; and it seems also no unusual thing amongst the
ancient Greeks for prophetesses to have the name of doves. 3 Lastly, others give this account : that in the hieroglyphical way of writing , according to Hierapollo , γυναίκα χήραν επιμείνασαν άχρι θανάτου
θέλοντες σημήναι περιστερών μέλαιναν ζωγραφούσι: they signify a widow , who remains unmarried till death, by a black pigeon : which very well agrees
with the forementioned relation of Herodotus. Others say, that this oracle was founded by the Pelasgians, who were the most ancient of all the nations that inhabited Greece. Of this opinion is Strabo,4 being led here
unto by the testimony of Homer, who calls the same Jupiter by the two names of Dodonæus and Pelasgicus, in this verse :5 Jove, Dodonean god, Pelasgian !
Hesiod, whose testimony also Strabo makes use of, is yet more express.
Δωδώνην, φηγόν τε Πελασγών έδρανον ήκεν. He to Dodona came, and the hallowed oak, The seat of the Pelasgi.
And this seems somewhat more probable ; especially if what is commonly reported of Deucalion deserve any credit, viz. that he saved himself from the deluge, not on the top of the mountain at Dodona, but on Parnassus, where was the oracle of Themis, consulted by him after his deliverance.
Strabo relates another fabulous opinion concerning the foundation of this oracle, out of Suidas' Thessalica, who, out of a design to gratify the Thes salians with a new invented fable , has reported that the oracle of Dodona
was translated into Epirus out of Pelasgia, a country of Thessaly, being accompanied by a great number of women, from whom the prophetesses in after ages were descended ; and that Jupiter received from them the
appellation of Pelasgicus,
The persons that delivered the oracles were, at the first, men, as Strabo and Eustathius have observed out of Homer, who calls them in the mas
culine gender, Υποφήτας , and Σελλούς: Ζεύ, άνα Δωδωναίε , Πελασγικέ, τηλόθε ναίων , Thou, whom Dodona's frozen cliffs revere , Δωδώνης μεδέων δυσχειμέρου" αμφί δε Σελλοί Where the prophetic Selli dwell around, Σοί ναίουσ υποφήται ανιπτόποδες χαμαιεύναι.

The same, with other accounts of these titles, are also given by the old scholiast upon that passage of Homer.

temple called Dodonides. Their names were these : Ambrosia, Eudora, Pasithoë, Coronis, Plexaure, Pytho, and Tyche, or Tythe. However that
be, it is certain that in later ages the oracles were pronounced by three old women ; and Strabo tells us this change was made, when Jupiter admitted Dione to cohabit with him , and receive divine honours in this
temple ; nor was it strange or unusual that the same temple should belong to two deities ; for Apollo and Bacchus were worshipped in the temple at
Delphi, Apollo and Branchus, or, as others affirm , Jupiter and Apollo at Miletus.
2 Of the people who consulted this oracle, all others received answers
from women, but the Boeotians received theirs from men ; and the reason
of this custom was this : in a war between the Boeotians and Pelasgians, the Boeotians coming to Dodona, to inquire of Jupiter the event of the war, received answer, that their enterprise should have success , if they
would act wickedly. Upon this, the Boeotians, suspecting that the pro phetess spoke in favour of the Pelasgians (they being the first founders of
that oracle), seized her, and cast her into the fire, justifying the lawfulness of the fact. On the other hand, they that ministered in the temple, think ing it impious to put to death, especially in so sacred a place, persons uncondemned, would have had them refer the matter to the two surviving prophetesses : but the Boeotians alleging that no laws in the world pere mitted women to do judgment, it was agreed that two men should be in
joint commission with them. When the time to pass sentence was come,
they were condemned by the women, and absolved by the men ; where
upon, as was usual when the number of voices was equal on both sides,
the Boeotians were acquitted and dismissed . Ever after, it was estab
lished that men only should give answers to the Boeotians. The prophets of this temple were commonly called tomuri, the pro phetesses tomuræ, from Tomurus, a mountain in Thesprotia, at the foot
of which stood the temple. So commonly was this word made use of, that it came at last to be a general name for any prophet; for so Hesychius
expounds it, and Lycophron 3 in this sense applies it to Prylis the son of Mercury :
Τόμουρο, προς τα λίστα νημερτέστατο . The best of prophets, and the truest too.
Some are of opinion that all the oracles were here delivered by women, and that the Selli were only inhabitants of the neighbouring country , who
had some employment in the temple, and published the oracles received from the prophetesses to other men. Hence they will have them to be called by Homer, not προφήτας , but υποφήτας υποφήτας γαρ λέγουσι τους
περί τα χρηστήρια ασχολουμένους και τας μαντείας τάς γιγνομένος υπό τον isgéwr éxpégortas. That name signifying men who lived in the temple, and published the answers made by the priests.

OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE. 263
which the dryades, fauni, and satyri, were thought to inhabit, and in which they were frequently seen dancing under the shade of the trees. Before sowing was invented , when men lived upon acorns, those of this wood were very much esteemed . These oaks or beeches were endued with a human voice and prophetical
spirit , for which reason they were called προσηγόροι, and μαντικαι δρύες, i . e. speaking and prophesying oaks. And Argo, the ship of the Argonauts, being built with the trees of this wood, was endued with the same power of speaking, whence Lycophron calls it várnogov xiooxy, a chatteriny mag pie. The reason of which fiction some think was this : the prophets,
when they gave answers, placed themselves in one of these trees ( for some will only allow this vocal faculty to one of them ), and so the oracle was thought to be uttered by the oak , which was only pronounced out of its
hollow stock, or from among its branches. And some are of opinion, that the oracles were delivered from the branches of the tree, because the pro
phetical pigeon is by Herodotus reported ini Ongoữ " Geodas, to have sat
upon the tree: and the scholiast upon Sophocles affirms, that útsgávw tou Marteiou dúo noav rias101, above the oracle there were two pigeons. But others rather think that oracles were pronounced from the hollow stock,
both because the prophetess could best be concealed there, and because it is expressed and affirmed in the following fragment of Hesiod's Eoa :

of Olympian Jupiter, which was once famous, but did not continue long in repute ; yet the temple in which it stood still preserved its ancient
splendour, and was adorned with magnificent structures, and enriched with presents from every part of Greece. Pindar also has taken notice of an
altar dedicated to Jupiter at Pisa , where answers were given by the poste rity of Janus.
There was another very ancient oracle of Jupiter in Crete, mentioned hy Strabo, from which Minos is said to have received a platform of the laws afterwards enacted by him :2
'Εννίωρος βασίλευε Διός μεγάλου οαριστής. Minos, that counsels dar'd with Jove to mix, sceptre sway'd.
That is, as Plato in Strabo expounds it, he descended into the sacred cave of Jupiter ( for this oracle was under ground), and received from him those precepts which he afterwards made public for the common benefit of man kind. The will of the gods was revealed in this place by dreams, in which
the gods came and conversed familiarly with the inquirers ; as we learn from the story of Epimenides, who lay asleep in this place many years. Pythagoras also descended into this cave to consult the gods, as Diogenes Laërtius has related in the life of that philosopher. There was a temple
in the same place dedicated to Jupiter, from which to the city Cnossus * there was a very pleasant high road. It stood upon mount Ida, and
though Maximus Tyrius, in the forementioned place, calls it Auxtaíou Asòs övtpor,, yet in his twenty -second dissertation, he says it was placed on Ida, to which Diogenes Laërtius and others agree. It was sometimes
called 'Agríomov, from the word ápxéovi, to help, or defend; because the
sons of Titan, being vanquished by Saturn, fled into this cave, and there escaped the fury of their pursuing conqueror."

resorted
thither
for
counsel
;
in
which
respects
it
surpassed
not
only
all
the
oracles
of
other
gods
,
but
even
those
sacred
to
Apollo
himself
.
The place in which the oracles were delivered was called Pythium , the
priestess Pythia ; the sports also instituted in honour of Apollo were named Pythian, and Apollo himself Pythius; either from Python, a serpent, or a man for his cruelty so called, who possessed this place and was overcome
hy Apollo: or árò soll zubes, to putrefy ; because the carcass of Python was suffered to lie there and putrefy :' or árò toŨ tubéoles, to inquire; because the oracle was there consulted and inquired of:? or from Pytho,
another name of Delphi, the place of this oracle, given it from Pythis, the son of Delphus, the son of Apollo.
The city Delphi ' was by some thought to be placed in the middle of the world ; and the poets feign that Jupiter, being desirous to ascertain the central part of the earth, sent forth two eagles, as Pindar majestically styles the birds, in a lost passage, of which Strabo has preserved the sense ; two swans, as Plutarch calls them , or two crows, as they are
named by Strabo himself, one from the east, the other from the west, and that they met in this place. However that be, it was situated in the middle of Greece : whence it is by the poets commonly called 'Onepáros,
a navel, because that is the middle part of the human body; and therefore Sophocles calls this oracle picóp padov parttiov; and in allusion to that name, Strabo and Pausanias say, there was to be seen in the temple the figure of a navel, made of white stone, with a riband hanging from it, instead of the navel string, and upon it were placed two eagles, in memory of the eagles sent forth by Jupiter. But Lactantius and Phurnutus are of opinion , that this name was not derived from the situation of the place,
but from the divine answers given there, which are in Greek called ' Ojpai, and Varro herein agrees with them .”
Concerning the origin of this oracle, there are various reports ; Diodorus
the Sicilian 6 tells us, it first belonged to Earth, by whom Daphne, one of the mountain -nymphs, was constituted priestess ; the same author after
wards says, that in a Greek poem, called Eumolpia, it is reported to have
been sacred both to Earth and Neptune ; and that Earth gave answers herself, but Neptune had an interpreter named Pyrco, and that afterwards Neptune resigned his part to Earth. This goddess was succeeded hy
Themis, who gave oracles about the time of Deucalion's deluge, and was consulted by him . Some there are that will have Themis to have pos sessed this oracle from the beginning ; which is the less to be wondered
at, since Themis and the Earth were commonly reputed the same goddess under different names, πολλών ονομάτων μορφή μία ;8 whence Themis is

called, Otāv papirfutárn, the oldest of the gods.' Yet the same authority elsewhere," reports, that this oracle was first possessed by the Earth, then by Themis, daughter of the Earth, who resigned it to her sister Phoebe,
by whom it was at length given to A pollo. Pindar, and from him the scholiast upon Æschylus, tells us, that Apollo having seized this oracle by force, the Earth endeavoured to precipitate that god into the infernal regions. And Euripides reports, that Apollo having expelled Themis,
was himself expelled by the Earth, but recovered the oracle by the assist ance of Jupiter. Agreeable to which relation is that of Apollodorus, that Apollo having learned the art of divination from Pan, came to Delphi, where oracles were then given by Themis, and having killed Python, the
serpent which guarded the mouth of the sacred cavern , seized the oracle. It must not be omitted, that when this oracle was possessed by the Earth , she returned answers by dreams. Thus Euripides :*

To expel the Earth with her nocturnal oracles from the Pythian temples. And this goddess was reputed the author of dreams in other places, as will appear in the chapter concerning that sort of divination. Others will have
the Delphian oracle to have belonged to Saturn ;6 and we are informed that the Grecians received that celebrated answer ότι τα δεκάτω έτει το "Ιλιον Frogtoovor, that Troy should be taken by them in the tenth year , from this god .' However that be, it came at length into the hands of Apollo : nor did he long enjoy it alone ; for in the war against the sons of Titan , Bac
chus being mangled and torn in pieces by them , was afterwards restored to his brother Apollo, who received him into his temple, and ordered that divine honours should be paid him there. Hence some say , the city Delphi was so called, q. 'Adea poi, brethren , because Apollo and Bacchus
were both sons of Jupiter.
We find it related , that this oracle was first discovered by goats, in
memory whereof, the Delphians, when they asked counsel of the god, for the most part offered a goat. The following circumstances led to the dis
covery : upon mount Parnassus, where goats were wont to feed, there was a deep cavern , with a small narrow mouth , to which , when any of the goats approached, they began immediately to leap after an unusual and antic manner, uttering strange and unheard- of sounds. The goatherd (Plutarch calls him Coretas), observing this, and wondering at the cause ,
went himself to view the cavern, whereupon he was seized with a similar

frenzy, leaping, and dancing, and foretelling things to come. This being noised abroad, vast multitudes of people flocked to the place, where as many as looked in were possessed after the same manner. At length,
when many were possessed with such a degree of divine phrenzy, as to throw themselves headlong into the chasm , there was an edict issued, by
which it was made unlawful for any man to approach it ; and a tripos was placed upon the mouth of it, upon which a virgin was appointed to sit, and there deliver the answers of the god. This is the most common
account of the origin of the oracle : Pausanias has given others, which I forbear to mention. This much, however, is certain (if any thing so remote may be called so,) that this oracle was very ancient, and flourished
above a hundred years before the Trojan war. Concerning the tripos placed upon the mouth of the cavern , there are different opinions; some say it was a pot filled with dust, through which the afflatus passed into the virgin's belly, and thence proceeded out of the mouth ; some that it was a wide-mouthed brass pot, filled with tñpon, or pebbles, by the leaping of which the prophetess made her conjectures ; others, that it was a large vessel supported by three feet, into which the
prophetess plunged herself, when she expected an inspiration . But, according to the more common opinion , it was not a vessel , but a table

or seat, on which the Pythia leaned or sat. The cover of the tripos, or,
as some say , the tripos itself, they called "Olpos , which word properly denotes a mortar, or round stone, according to Hesychius; whence Apollo
is called in Sophocles, " Evodpos , and his prophetess "Evoquis. And this, as some are of opinion , gave occasion to the proverb, 'Ey öt pea eurdow , which is applied to those that speak prophetically ; but others arrive it from a certain diviner, called Holmus ; and others refer it to the old saperstitious custom of sleeping in these apot, when they desired a pro

phetical dream . Phurnutus will have the tripos to have been sacred to
Apollo, either because of the perfection of the number three, or in allusion to the three celestial circles, two of which the sun touches, and passes over the third in his annual circuit. And the scholiast upon Aristophanes ?
will have the three legs of the tripos to signify the knowledge of the god , as distinguished by the three parts of time, viz ., present, past, and future:
"Ος τ' δει τα τ' όντα, τα τ' άσσόμενα, πρό τ' εόντα. Who knew things past, and present, and to come.
The same tripos was not always used ; the first was laced there by the
inhabitants of the neighbouring country ; afterwards, when Pelops married . Hippodamia, the daughter of Enomaus, king of the Eleans, he presented to Apollo a tripos, wrought by Vulcan, which seems to have been that
made of brass, so famous amongst the poets. There was also another tripos of gold,2 dedicated to Apollo on this account : certain fishermen at
Miletus having sold their next draught to some persons that stood by,
cast their net into the water, and drew up a golden tripos ; whereupon there arose a very hot contention between the fishermen and their chap
men ; the fishermen alleging that they sold nothing but the fish they were to take, and that therefore the tripos belonged to them : the buyers, on the
other hand, replied that they had bought the whole draught, and therefore laid a just claim to whatever came to the net. At length , when neither
side would yield, they agreed to submit the matter to Apollo's deter mination ; whereupon they came to Delphi, and there received this answer :
" Βεγονε Μιλήτου , τρίποδος πέρι Φοίβον έρωτάς; To ask what must be with the tripod done “ ος σοφία πάντως πρώτος , τούτω τρίποδα δός. Give it to him whose wisdom claims a right Art thou a native of Miletus, come Above all others.
This oracle was given at the time when the seven wise men flourished
in Greece ; the tripus, therefore, was presented to one of them (which that was, is not agreed on by ancient writers ); he'modestly refusing it, they offered it to another, and so on to the rest, till it had been refused by them
all ; whereupon it wasdetermined to consecrate it to Apollo himself, as being the fountain of all wisdom. The tripos was called by the Latins cortina ,
of which appellation there are several reasons assigned , for which I refer
you to the grammarians. Others say cortina was only the cover of the tripos, and therefore derive it from the word corium , that is, a skin, be
cause it was made, as they say, of Python's skin . Lastly, others more probably think it signified the tent within which was kept the sacred tri
pos, and that because of its figure, which was like that of a caldron ,
round ; upon the same account cortina was used to signify the tiring -room in the theatre, or the curtains, or hangings, out of which the players used to be ushered on to the stage ; whence also the celestial hemisphere is by Ennius called coeli cortina ; and the tholus, or round compass at the t_p
of a theatre, is by another named cortina theatri.

such thing is said, or can be inferred from the Greek, where Perialla is
only called argónartes, which word (however it may seem to signify à pro phet superior to the rest), according to its common acceptation, implies no more than μάντις .. Thus Euripides has used it,' when he says, tópartis zexã , one that foretelleth evils to come : in which sense Herodotus
himself in another place has used the verb gospartsúcoro. More instances would be needless.

their chastity, having passed the time of childbearing, they might remain undiscovered, and not bring the oracles or religion into contempt. Never theless they wore the habit of virgins, thereby to signify their purity and virgin modesty.. They were obliged to observe the strictest laws of tem perance and chastity ; not being allowed to clothe themselves with rich and costly apparel, to use fantastical dresses, to anoint themselves with
perfumes, or to wear purple garments. The Pythia, before she ascended
the tripos, used to wash her whole body, especially her hair in Castalis, a fountain at the foot of Parnassus, where the poets, men inspired by the
same deity, used to wash and drink . At her first sitting down upon the tripos, she shook the laurel tree that grew by it, and sometimes ate the
leaves. Herself also, and the tripos, were crowned with garlands of the same plant. Nor did the Pythia only make use of laurel in this manner ,
but other prophets also, it being thought to conduce to inspiration ; whence it was peculiarly called partixòv Putòn, the prophetic plant. The Pythia
being placed upon the tripos, received the divine afilatus in her belly ;
wlience she is called εγγαστρίμυθος, or στερνόμανσις . She was no sooner inspired than she began immediately to swell, and foam at the mouth, tearing her hair, cutting her flesh, and in all her other behaviour appear
ing like one frantic and distracted . But she was not always affected in the same manner : for, if the spirit was in a kind and gentle humour, her
rage was not very violent ; but if sullen and malignant, she was thrown into extreme fury, insomuch that,3 on one occasion , she affrighted not only those that consulted the oracle, but the priests themselves, who ran away
and left her : and so violent was the paroxysm , that in a little time after she died. Some say , that under the tripos sometimes appeared a dragon
that returned answers, and that the Pythia was once killed by him . And Eusebius reports , δράκοντα είλεϊσθαι περί τον τρίποδα, that a serpent rolled himself about the tripod. The time of consulting the oracle was only one month in the year . This month was called Búoios, and in the opinion of many was so named ,
g. Quoros, from puuv, to spring up , because it was in the beginning of
spring, when all things flourish and put forth buds: but this is not the true reason , for the Delphians do not use B for $ (as the Macedonians, who for Φίλιππος, Φαλακρός and Φεροίκα, say Βίλιππος , Βαλακρός and Βερονίκα) , but instead of 11 ; they usually say, Barsūv for nursīv, and Boxgòv for sixgày: Βύσιος therefore is put for Πύσιος , s0 called δια την πύσιν, because in that
month they were allowed to inquire of Apollo's oracle, and this is their
genuine and country way of speaking. The seventh day of this month they esteemed Apollo's birthday, naming it Ilonuploos (not tokúpberos, as
some read it), not because they baked a sort of cakes called pêóïs, but he cause the god then returned a great many answers ; and at the first the
Pythia gave answers only on this day, as Callisthenes and Anaxandridas

At these sacrifices there were five priests, named "Oo101,
holy , who assisted the prophets, and performed many other offices with them , being supposed to be descended from Deucalion ; there was one also
who presided over these, called 'Oowane, or purifier ; though Plutarch says, that the sacrifice slain when any of the " Oon were declared was called
by that name ; unless instead of tò Juópevov isgsãov, or the sacrifice killed ,
we might be allowed to read sòv Juópevov isption, or the person that killed the sacrifice. There was another priest also that assisted the prophetess
in managing the oracle, whom they called 'Aqńowe, upon the same account that Apollo was so named. The answer was always returned in Greek, as appears from Cicero, who, speaking of the oracle, reported by Ennius to be given to Pyrrhus the Epirote, by Apollo, namely, Aio te, Facida, Romanos vincere posse. Go, Pyrrhus, go, engage with warlike Rome, And you the valiant Romans shall o'ercome. H.H.
concludes it was not genuine, because the Pythia never used to speak in and in Pyrrhus' time had left off giving answers in verse, which
had been the custom in all former ages, from the first foundation of the oracle, deriving its origin from Phoemonoë, the first Pythia. The an cient Greeks delivered their laws in verse, whence it came to pass, that
róuos, which properly signifies a law , is often used to signify verses or songs . The first philosophers, as oft as they thought fit to communicate
their mysteries to the world, clothed them in verse , and the primitive ages scarce seem to have written any thing curious or excellent, nor any thing
of weight or moment, but in verse. The verses of the Pythia were, for
the most part, says Plutarch ,' rude and unpolished, and not comparable to
those of Homer or Hesiod ; yet, says he, this is no reflection upon Apollo, the patron of poets, because he only communicated the knowledge to
the Pythia , which she delivered in what dress she pleased ; the sense therefore was his, the words her own . In the same book he tells us, that
some were of opinion , that there were poets maintained in the temple, to catch the oracles as they were given, and wrap thein up in verse .

In later ages, when oracles began to grow into disrepute, this custom of versifying was left off. I shall only add one thing more to be observed, that as the custom of giving answers in verse never obtained so univer sally but that sometimes they were delivered in prose , as Plutarch has proved by a great many instances, só neither was it ever so wholly left of, but that sometimes oracles were pronounced in verse ; an instance whereoi
he giveth in his own time. The oracle concerning the birth of our Saviour Christ, which was delivered in heroic verse to the emperor Augustus, is
mentioned by Eusebius, Zonaras, and others ; and another, which was returned in the same sort of verse to Julian the Apostate, shall be repeated hereafter.
The Delphian oracles, if compared with some others, might justly be called plain and perspicuous; and, as Hermeas the philosopher tells us, it was usual for those that had received an obscure answer at Dodona to
desire Apollo at Delphi to explain the meaning of it : he adds also, that Apollo had interpreted a great many of them . Nevertheless, they were
generally very obscure and ambiguous ;' insomuch that Apollo, as some say , was called Λοξίας , because his answers were λοξά και σχολιά , crooked and hard to be understood. And Heraclitus in Plutarch, speak
ing of Apollo, says , ούτε λέγει, ούτε κρύπτει, αλλά σημαίνει, he doth not speak the truth plainly , nor yet wholly conceal it, but only gives small hints of it ; so that if the event happened contrary to any man's expecta
tion, he might rather find fault with his own interpretation of the oracles, than call in question either the knowledge or veracity of Apollo. The

reason of this affected obscurity is said to have been this, namely, oj xaba pã xabagoù pártsolar Isposòv,' &c. that impure persons ought not to be admitted to sacred things : being a profanation of the mysteries, and other
things relating to religion, to communicate them to the vulgar and igno rant.
The veracity of this oracle was so famous, that Tờ čx agirodos, the responses given from the tripos, came to be used proverbially for certain and infallible truths ; and, as Cicero rightly argues , it is impossible the Delphian oracle should ever have gained so much repute in the world, or
have been enriched with such vast presents from almost all kings and
nations, had not the truth of its predictions been attested by the experience of all ages. But in later times the case was altered ; and so Cicero tells
us, it was a long time before his days; Demosthenes, who flourished three hundred years before him, complained that the Pythia did Qidirritay, or speak as Philip the Macedonian would have her. Before that time, she was said to receive a bribe of Člisthenes, to persuade the Lacedæmonians to free the Athenians from the tyrants that were imposed on them . Perialla, the
Pythia, was deprived of her office for being corrupted by one of Cleome nes' agents, to say that Demaratus, Cleomenes' colleague, was not the true son of Aristo, king of Sparta, to the end it might be thought he was not his lawful successor, and upon that account be dethroned.
At what time, or upon what account, this oracle came to cease , is un certain : Strabo has told us,3 that in his time it had lost its ancient repu tation. Dio will have it to have been extinct from the time that it was
polluted by Nero, who killed men εις το στόμιον εξ ου ιερών το πνεύμα ανήσι, in the cavern's mouth , out of which the sacred inspiration ascended . In Juvenal's time the gods had quite forsaken it, if any

defect, or a perpetual silence ; for this oracle ? repeatedly lost and recovered
its prophetic faculty, Lucian 8 reports that answers were given in his time, which was about the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his son Com

only supposititious. And farther, it is certain that this, and those at Delos,
and Dodona, with some others, continued till the reign of Julian the Apostate, and were consulted by him : and he is said to have received from
Apollo Delphicus the following answer : Είπατε τω βασιλήί, χαμαι πέσε δαίδαλος αυλα Ουκέτι Φοίβος έχει καλύβαν ου μαντίδα δάφνην , Ου πάγων λαλέουσαν , απέσβετο και καλόν ύδωρ.*
By which it appears this oracle was then in a very low and declining con dition ; but at what time it was finally extinct, is uncertain . For more particular information consult Van Dale's treatise .
When the god forsook Delphi, he betook himself to the Hyperborean Scythians ;' and in former times he was thought to be a lover of that nation, and at certain seasons to remove thither out of Greece. Abaris, one of that country, and priest to Apollo, who travelled into Greece about
the time of Pythagoras, is said to have written a book concerning Apollo's oracles, rcà apišey eis 'Trigßogious, and removal to the Hyperboreans . And the Athenians, at a time when the plague raged over all Greece,
received an oracle from thence, commanding them to make vows and prayers in behalf of the rest ; and they continued to send gifts and offer
ings thither, as they had formerly done Delphi. There was another Apollo's oracles at Cirrha, a seaport belonging to
Delphi, from which it was distant about sixty stadia. This is mentioned in Statius' Thebais :* Tunc et Apollinece tacuere oracula Cirrhæ . Where Lutatius observes, that at Cirrhu none but prosperous oracles
were pronounced ; and if any calamity was to befall them who came for advice, that was declared by the god's silence .' Several others have men tioned this oracle, though not taken notice of either by Strabo or Pausan ias ; the latter of whom has left us a particular account of the temple, sacred field of Apollo, and other remarkable things in Cirrha . Some speak of this oracle in such a manner as makes it probable that it was the same with the oracle at Delphi. Thus Seneca will have it become Apollo's, by his victory over Python, whereby he is known to have
obtained the Delphian . And a prophetess is reported by the same author to have delivered oracles at Cirrha, as was done in the Delphian temple.
Lastly , there was a cavern at Cirrha, as in the other place.?
Next to this oracle may justly follow that at Delos, the most celebrated of all the Cyclades, which were a group of islands in the Ægean sea. It
is famous among the poets for having been the birth -place of Apollo and Diana, and was therefore accounted so sacred and inviolable , that the
Persians, when they pillaged or destroyed almost all the other Grecian temples, durst not attempt any thing upon the temple in this island,

which was seated on the sea shore, looking towards Euboea, in the very place where Apollo was feigned to be born. He had an image erected in this place, in the shape of a dragon ; and gave answers, for their certainty
and perspicuity, not only not inferior to those at Delphi, but, as some report, ' far exceeding them , and all other oracles of A pollo : being delivered
in clear plain terms, without any ambiguity or obscurity. But these answers were not to be expected all the year ; Apollo only kept his summer's resi dence in this place, and in winter retired to Patara, a city of Lycia.2
One of the altars was by some reckoned among the seven wonders of the world. It was erected by Apollo at the age of four years, and composed
of the horns of goats killed by Diana upon mount Cynthus, which were compacted together in a wonderful manner, without any visible tie or cement. To sacrifice any living creature upon this altar was held unlaw ful, and a profanation of the place , which it was the god's will to have
preserved pure from blood, and all manner of pollution . No dogs were permitted to enter into this island: and it was unlawful for any person to die, or be born in it ; and therefore, when the Athenians were by the oracle commanded to purify it, they dug up the dead bodies out of their graves, and wafted them over the sea, to be interred in one of the adjacent islands; this done, the better to preserve it from pollution , they put forth
an edict, commanding, that all persons sick of any mortal or dangerous disease, and all pregnant women, should be carried over to the little isle called Rhena.
I must not omit here the annual procession made by the Athenians to this place. The author of this custom was Theseus, who being sent with the rest of the Athenian youths into Crete, to be devoured by the Mino taur, made a vow to Apollo that if he would grant them a safe return , they would make a solemn voyage to his temple at Delos every year.
This was called Oswpice, the persons employed in it Oiwgoà, and Andenotai, from the name of the island, the chief of them ’Aexreiwpos, and the ship in which they went, Osweis, or Andies, which was the very same that carried Theseus and his companions to Crete ; being, says Plutarch, preserved by the Athenians till Demetrius the Phalerean's time, they restoring always
what was decayed , and changing the old rotten planks for those that were new and entire, insomuch that it furnished the philosophers with matter of dispute, whether, after so many reparations and alterations, it might still be called the same individual ship ; and served as an instance to illus
trate the opinion of those who held that the body still remained the same numerical substance, notwithstanding the continual decay of old parts, and acquisition of new ones, through the several stages of life. For which
reason Callimachus calls its tackle ascúorta, ever- living: 5 -- αειζώοντα θεωρίδος, ιερά Φοίβω , The sturdy Theoris the Athenians send ; Κεκροπίδαι πάμπουσι τυπητα νηός εκείνης. Yet spite of envious time, and angry seas, To great Apollo's temple every year,

The beginning of the voyage was computed from the time that the priest of Apollo first adorned the stem of the ship with garlands ; and from that time they began to cleanse and lustrate the city : and it was held unlawful
to put any malefactor to death till its return , which was the reason that Socrates was reprieved thirty days after his condemnation . The Theori
wore garlands of laurel upon their heads, and were accompanied by two of
the family of the Kingures, who were appointed to be Tlapkoitos at Delos
for that year. Before them went certain men with axes in their hands, in show as if they designed to clear the ways of robbers; to commemorate the fact that Theseus, in his journey from Troezen to Athens, freed the country from all the robbers that infested those parts . When they went
thither they were said avaßaívesy, to ascend ; when they returned, keta Baivev, to descend. When they arrived , they offered sacrifice, and cele brated a festival in honour of Apollo ; this done, they repaired to their ship, and sailed homewards. At their return , all the people ran forth to meet them, opening their doors, and making oþeisance as they passed by ." The next oracle I shall speak of is that of Apollo Didymæus, so named 5 from the double light imparted by him to mankind ; the one directly and immediately from his own body, and the other by reflection from the
The place of it was also called Didyma, and belonged to the Milesians, and hence Apollo is called Milesius. It was also called the
oracle of the Branchidæ , and Apollo himself was called Branchides, from Branchus, who was the reputed son of Macareus, but begotten by Apollo ;
for it was no unusual thing for the ancient heroes to be called the sons of
two fathers, the one mortal, who was always their mother's husband , the other some lascivious deity that had fallen in love with her : so Hercules was the reputed son of Jupiter and Amphitryon ; Hector of Priam and Apollo. The origin of this oracle is thus described by Varro, where speaking of Branchus' mother, he reports, that being with child , she dreamed the sun entered into her mouth , and passed through her belly ; whence her child was named Branchus, from Bpóyxos, the throat, through
which the god had penetrated into the womb. The boy afterwards having kissed Apollo in the woods, and received from him a crown and sceptre,
began to prophesy, and presently after disappeared .' Whereupon a mag
nificent temple was dedicated to him and Apollo Philesius, so called from piasīv, to kiss ; some derive the name from Branchus, a Thessalian youth, beloved by Apollo, who received him into his own temple, and commanded that divine honours should be paid him after death . But others6 tell us, that this oracle was sacred to Jupiter and Apollo, and perhaps it might
belong to all three. However that be, we are assured that this oracle was
very ancient, and frequented by all the Ionians and Æolians :?? and farther , that it was accounted χρηστηρίων Ελληνικών μεσα Δελφούς κράτισ Toy, the best of all the Grecian oracles, except the Delphian . 1 Plato in Phædone.

cally, may be conjectured to be about four cubits . Its depth does not appear to me more than eight cubits. There are not steps to its bottom :
but when any one designs to descend to Trophonius, they give him a lad
der, which is both narrow and light. On descending into this chasm , between its bottom and its summit there is a small cavern , the breadth of
which is about two spans, and its altitude appears to be about one span .
He, therefore, who descends to the bottom of this chasm lays himself down on the ground, and holding in his hand sops mingled with honey, first of all places his feet in the small cavern , then hastens to join his knees
to his feet; and immediately after, the rest of his body contracted to his knees, is drawn within the caver , just as if he was hurried away by the vortex of the largest and most rapid river. But those that have descended
to the adytum of this place are not all instructed in the secrets of futurity in the same manner . For one obtains this knowledge by his sight, and
another by his hearing: but all return through the same opening, and walk backwards as they return . They say no one that descended here ever died in the chasm , except one of the spear-bearers of Demetrius, who would not perform any of the established religious ceremonies, and who did not
come hither for the purpose of consulting the divinity, but that he might
enrich himself by carrying the gold and silver from the adytum . It is also said, that his dead body was thrown up by a different avenue, and not through the sacred opening. Other reports are circulated about this man , but those which I have mentioned appear to me to be the most remarka
ble. When the person that descended to Trophonius returns, the sacri ficers immediately place him on a throne, which they call the throne of
Mnemosyne, and which stands not far from the adytum . Then they ask him what he has either seen or heard, and afterwards deliver him to cer tain persons appointed for this purpose, who bring him to the temple of
Good Fortune, and the Good Dæmon , while he is yet full of terror, und
without any knowledge either of himself, or of those that are near him.
Afterwards, however, he recovers the use of his reason , and laughs just the same as before . 1 I write this notfrom hearsay, but what I have seen

the vracle of Trophonius. All, too, that return from · Trophonius are obliged to write in a table whatever they have either heard or seen .
Thus far Pausanias, Plutarch's relation concerns the appearances ex hibited to consultants, which, though they were various, and seldom the
same, seeing it is a remarkable story, I will give it you. * Timarchus being a youth of liberal education , and just initiated in the
rudiments of philosophy, was greatly desirous of knowing the nature and
efficacy of Socrates' demon : wherefore, communicating his project to no
mortal body but me and Cebes, after the performance of all the rituals requisite for consultation , he descended Trophonius' cave : where having
staid two nights and one day, his return was wholly despaired of, inson much that his friends bewailed him as dead : in the morning he came up very brisk , and, in the first place, paid some venerable acknowledgments
to the god : after that, having escaped the staring rout, he laid open to us
a prodigious relation of what he had seen or heard , to this purpose : in his descent, he was beset with a caliginous mist, upon which he prayed , lying prostrate for a long time, and not having sense enough to know whether
he was awake or in a dream , he surmises, that he received a blow on his
head , with such an echoing violence as dissevered the sutures of his skull, through which his soul migrated ; and being disunited from the body and mixed with bright and refined air, with a seeming contentment, began to breathe for a long time, and being dilated like a full sail, was wider than
before. After this, having heard a small noise , whistling in his ears, a delightsome sound, he looked up, but saw not a spot of earth, only islands reflecting a glimmering flame, interchangeably receiving different colours,
according to the different degrees of light. They seemed to be of an infi nite number, and of a stupendous size, not bearing an equal parity betwixt one another in this, though they were all alike, namely, globular; it may
be conjectured, that the circumrotation of these moved the ether, which
occasioned that whistling, the gentle pleasantness of which bore an ade_ quate agreement with their well -timed motion . Between these there was a sea or lake, which spread out a surface glittering with many colours, in termixed with an azure ; some of the islands Aloated on its stream , by which they were driven on the other side of the torrent ; many others were carried to and fro, so that they were well nigh sunk. This sea , for the most part, was very shallow and fordable, except towards the south , where it is of great depth ; it very often ebbed and flowed, but not with a high tide : some part of it had a natural sea -colour, untainted with any
other, as miry and muddy as any lake : the rapidness of the torrent carried back those islands from whence they had grounded, and situating them in the same place as at first, or bringing them about with a circumference; but in the gentle turning of them, the water makes one rising roll ; be twixt these, the sea seemed to bend inwards about (as near as he could
guess) eight parts of the whole. This sea had two mouths, which were iniets to boisterous rivers, casting out fiery foam , the flaming brightuess

In the time of the Persian war, this temple was plundered and burned ,
being betrayed into the hands of the barbarians by the Branchidæ , or priests, who had the care of it ; but they, conscious of their own wicked ness, and fearing lest they should meet with condign punishment, desired of Xerxes, that, as a requital of their service, he would grant them a
habitation in some remote part of Asia, whence they might never return into Greece, but live secure , beyond the reach of justice. Xerxes granted
their request : whereupon, notwithstanding a great many unlucky omens appeared to them , they founded a city, and called it after their ancient name, Branchida . But for all this, they could not escape divine ven geance, which was inflicted on their children by Alexander the Great, who, having conquered Darius, and possessed himself of Asia, utterly demolished their city, and put all its inhabitants to the sword, as detesting
the very posterity of such impious wretches, The Persians being vanquished , and peace restored to Greece, the temple was rebuilt by the Milesians, with such magnificence, that it sur
passed almost all the other Grecian temples in size, being raised to such a bulk, that they were forced to let it remain uncovered ; for the compass
of it was no less than that of a village, and contained at least four or five stadia .
Another of Apollo's oracles we read of in Aba, a city of Phocis, and are told it was more ancient than the Delphian. The temple of this oracle was burned by Xerxes." At Claros, a city of Ionia, not far from Colophon, there was another oracle sacred to Apollo, first instituted by Manto, the daughter of Tiresias, who fled thither in the second Theban war , when the Epigoni, that is, the sons of those that were slain in the former war, invaded Thebes, under the conduct of Alcmæon , in revenge of their father's death . The person that delivered answers, was a man generally chosen out of some certain families, and for the most part out of Miletus ;5 he was usually unlearned , and very ignorant, yet returned the oracles in verses wonderfully satisfac
tory, and adapted to the intention of the inquirers: and this by virtue of a little well, feigned to have sprung out of the tears of Manto, when she
bewailed the desolation of her country. Into this he descended when any
one came to consult him ; but paid dear for his knowledge, water being very prejudicial to his health ; and 6 a means to shorten his life. By this oracle , the untimely death of Germanicus was foretold .?
At Larissa, a fort of the Argives, there was an oracle of Apollo, sur named Asipaediúrns, from Diras, a region belonging to Argos. The answers in this place were returned by a woman , who was forbidden the company of men . Every month she sacrificed a lamb in the night, and then , hav
ing tasted the blood of the victim, was immediately seized with a divine phrenzy .

Apollo had another famous oracle at Eutresis, a village in Boeotia, seated in the way between the Thespians and the Platæans, Oropæan Apollo delivered oracles at Orope, a city of Euboea. At Orobiæ in Euboea, there was asudioteToy Marttiov, a most infallible
oracle, of Apollo Selinuntius.?. Another oracle of Corypæan Apollo, at Corypæ in Thessaly, is men
tioned in Nicander's Theriaca :
Μαντείας Κορυπαίος εθήκατε , και θέμιν ανδρών.
It is reported, that the Carians, on a certain time, consulted Apollo's oracle at Hybla, which Casaubon would have to be read Abæ, but for no better reason than that he finds no mention of the Hyblæan oracle in any
other author. There was an oracle of Apollo Ichnæus, at Ichnæa, in Macedonia .
At Tegyræ , a city in Boeotia, there was an oracle sacred to Tegyræan Apollo, which was frequented till the Persian war ; but after that remained
for ever silent.5 No less famous was Ptous, a mountain in Boeotia, for the oracles given hy Apollo, surnamed Ptous, from that place, where was a temple dedicated to him. This oracle ceased when Thebes was demolished by Alexander:
Apollo, surnamed Ac precios, from Daphne, his beloved mistress, or the laurel into which she was transformed, had an oracle near the Castalian
fountain , the waters of which were also endued with a prophetic virtue.? Apollo was called Ismenius, from Ismenus, a river and mountain in Boeotia , in which he had a temple, and gave answers to those that came
to inquire of him. We are told of another place in Boeotia ,8 where Apollo returned an
swers, namely, a stone called Ewogoviotne, upon which he had an altar, erected out of the ashes of victims offered to him ; whence he was called
Spodius, from Exodòs , ashes. He did not here, as in other places, signify his will by inspired prophets, but by randóss, ominous sounds, in
the observation of which he instructed persons appointed for that purpose ; for this mode of divination also was in use among the Grecians, especially at Smyrna, where was a temple built on the outside of the city wall for
that
purpose.

ground, at Lebadea , a city of Boeotia, into which , wheri he entered, he pretended to be inspired with an extraordinary knowledge of future events ;
but at length, either out of design to raise in men an opinion that he was translated to the gods, or being some way necessitated thereto, perished in his hole. Others tell us, that Trophonius and Agamedes, having built
Apollo's temple at Delphi, requested of the god , that as a recompense for, their labour, he would give them the best thing that could happen to man .
Apollo granted their petition , and promised them that it should be effected the third day after; accordingly, on that day, in the morning, they were found dead. Several other fables concerning him, and the manner of his death, are related in the scholiast upon the Clouds of Aristophanes. However that be, Trophonius had divine honours paid him after death , and was worshipped by the name of Jupiter Trophonius.3 Nor was it a thing unusual for men deified to be honoured with the name of god, several instances whereof might be produced , but one shall suffice for all,
namely, that of Agamemnon, who was worshipped at Sparta, by the name
of Jupiter Agamemnon . This oracle came first into repute on this account; on a time when , for the space of two years, there had been no rain in Boeotia, all the cities of
that country, with a joint consent, appointed chosen persons to go to Del phi, there to pay their devotions to Apollo, in the name of their country, and desire his advice and assistance: the god accepted their piety, but returned them no other answer than that they should go home and consult
Trophonius at Lebadea . The ambassadors immediately obeyed, and repaired to Lebadea, still remaining as much in the dark as at first; there being not the least sign or footstep of any oracle in that place ; at length, when
they had searched a long time to no purpose , and began to despair of suc cess, one Saon, an Acrephian , the senior of all the ambassadors, espied a
swarm of bees, and immediately took up a resolution to follow them ; by this means he came to a cave, into which he had no sooner entered, than
he perceived, by some evident tokens, that in that place was the oracle
Apollo had commanded them to inquire of. Upon this he paid his devo
tion to Trophonius, and received from him a welcome and satisfactory answer, together with instructions in what manner, and with what rites and ceremonies, he would have those that should come for advice, to approach him ,5
The place of this oracle was under the surface of the earth, and there fore it was commonly called xarobáclov, and the persons that consulted it xutaBaivoytes, because the way to it was a descent. Concerning it there are innumerable fables, which it would not be worth the while to mention
in this place ; I shall therefore pass them by, only giving you the accounts Pausanias and Plutarch have left of it ; the former of whom consulted it in

person , and thereby had an opportunity of being an eye-witness of what he reports.
When any one desires to descend into the cave of Trophonius, he must first take up his residence for a certain number of days in a building des tined to this purpose. This building is a temple of the Good Dæmon , and of Good Fortune. While he stays here he purifies himself in other re spects, and abstains from hot baths. The river Hercyra is used by him for a bath : and he is well supplied with animal food from the victims which are sacrificed . For he who descends hither, sacrifices to Tropho nius and his sons; to Apollo, Saturn, and Jupiter the king ; to Juno the
chariot driver ; and to Ceres, whom they call Europa, and who they say
was the nurse of Trophonius. A diviner is present to each of the sacri fices, who inspects the entrails of the victims, and while he beholds them ,
prophesies whether or not Trophonius will propitiously receive the person who consults him. The other victims do not in a similar manner disclose
the mind of Trophonius : but each person who descends to him , sacrifices, on the night in which he descends, a ram in a ditch, invoking, at the same time, Agamedes. They pay no regard to the former entrails, even though they should be favourable, unless the entrails of the ram are likewise aus picious. And when it happens that the entrails thus correspond in signi fication , then the person that wishes to consult Trophonius descends with good hope, and in the following manner : The sacrificers bring him by night to the river Hercyra ; there they anoint him with oil ; and two boys be longing to the city, each about thirteen years old , and whom they call Mercuries, wash him , and supply him with every thing necessary .
He is not immediately after this led by the sacrificers to the oracle, but is first brought to the fountains of the river, which are very near to each
other. Here he is obliged to drink of that which is called the water of
Lethe, that he may become oblivious of all the former objects of his pur suit. Afterwards he must drink of another water, which is called the
water of Mnemosyne, or memory , that he may remember the objects which will present themselves to his view on descending into the grove.
Having therefore beheld the statue, which they say was made by Dædalus (and which the priests never show to any but those who desire to consult
Trophonius ), performed certain religious ceremonies, and prayed, he pro ceeds to the oracle clothed in white linen, begirt with fillets, and having
on his feet such slippers as are worn by the natives of this place.

This oracle was had in very great esteem : it was amongst the five principal ones of Greece, consulted hy Croesus, before his expedition against Cyrus, viz. the Delphian, Dodonean, Amphiaraus', Trophonius', and the Didymæan ; and 2 was not inferior either to the two first of those already mentioned , or to that of Jupiter Ammon ,
Near the temple was the fountain, out of which Amphiaraus ascended into heaven, when he was received into the number of the gods, which,
for that reason , was called by his name : it was held so sacred, that it was a capital crime to employ the waters of it to any ordinary use , as the washing of hands, or purification ; nay, it was unlawful to offer sacrifices
before it, as was usual at other fountains. The chief use it was employed in was this, viz. they that by the advice of the oracle had recovered out of any disease, were to cast a piece of coined gold or silver into it ; and this
Pausanias tells us was an ancient custom , and derived from the primi tive ages.
At Pharæ , a city of Achaia, answers were given by Mercurius 'Ayo
peãos, so named from ágopà, the market -place, where was a statue of stone erected to him, having a beard, which seems to have been a thing unusual in his statues ; before it was placed a low stone altar, upon which stood brazen basins soldered with lead . They that came for advice, first
offered frankincense upon the altar, then lighted the lamps, pouring oil into them ; after that, they offered upon the right side of the altar a piece
of money, stamped with their own country impression, and called Maaxoüs ; then proposed the questions they desired to be resolved in, placing their ear close to the statue, and after all departed, stopping both their ears
with their hands, till they had passed quite through the market -place ; then they plucked away their hands, and received the first voice that pre sented itself as a divine oracle. The same ceremonies were practised in Egypt, at the oracle of Serapis ."
At Bura 5 in Achaia , there was an oracle of Hercules, called from that city Buraicus. The place of it was a cave, wherein was Hercules? statue : predictions were made by throwing dice. They that consulted the god, first addressed themselves to him by prayer ; then taking four dice out of a great heap that lay ready there, they threw them upon the table : all the dice had on them certain peculiar marks, all which were
interpreted in a book kept for that purpose : as soon, therefore, as they had
cast the dice, they went to the book, and there every man found his doom .
At Patræ , a city on the sea -coast of Achaia, not far from the sacred
grove of Apollo, there was a temple dedicated to Ceres, in which were
erected three statues, two to Ceres and Proserpine, standing ; the third to Earth, sitting upon a throne. Before the temple there was a fountain, in which were delivered oracles, very famous for the truth of their predict

tions. These were not given upon every account, but concerned only the events of diseases . The manner of consulting was this ; they let down a looking -glass by a small cord into the fountain , so low that the bottom of
it might just touch the surface of the water, but not to be covered by it : this done, they offered incense and prayers to the goddess; then looked upon the glass, and from the various figures and images represented in it, made conjectures concerning the patient.
At Troezen , a city of Peloponnesus, there was an old altar dedicated to the Muses and Sleep, by Ardalus, one of Vulcan's sons, who was the first inventor of the flute, and a great favourite of the Muses, who from him were called Ardalides. They that came for advice were obliged to abstain certain days from wine ; afterwards they lay down by the altar to
sleep, where, by the secret inspiration of the Muses, proper remedies for their distempers were revealed to them .
At Epidaurus,” a city of Peloponnesus, there was a temple of Æscula pius, famed for euring diseases; the remedies of which were revealed in
dreams. When the cure was perfected, the names of the diseased per sons, together with the manner of their recovery, were registered in the temple . This god was afterwards translated to Rome , by command of Delphian Apollo, who told them that was the only way to be freed from the plague, which at that time raged exceedingly amongst them : where
upon they sent ambassadors to Epidaurus, to desire the god of them ; but the Epidaurians being unwilling to part with so beneficial a guest,
Æsculapius, of his own accord, in the shape of a great serpent, went straight to the Roman ship, where he reposed himself, and was with great veneration conveyed to Rome, where he was received with great joy ; and having delivered them from the distress they lay under, was honoured with à temple in the little island, encompassed by the river Tiber, and worshipped in the same form he had assumed .3
At Amphiclea, called by Herodotus Ophitea, by Stephanus Amphicæa, there was a temple sacred to Bacchus, but no image, at least none exposed
to public view. To this god , the Amphicleans ascribed both the cure of their diseases, and the foretelling of future events ; the former he effected by revealing proper remedies in dreams, the latter by inspiring into his priests divine knowledge.

ambassadors to consult this oracle , and particularly Cyrus, who being desirous to know by what death he was to die, received this answer, Ta

ój the fury of the women, because he professed a hatred and aversion to the whole sex : his head being thrown into the sea, was cast upon Lesbos, where it returned answers in a cavern of the earth. There were also
persons initiated into the mysteries of Orpheus, called 'Ogpotsaso tai, who assured all those that should be admitted into their society of certain felicity after death ; of which, when Philip, one of that order, but miser
ably poor and indigent, boasted , Leotychidas the Spartan replied , “ Why do not you die then , you fool, and put an end to your misfortunes, together with your life ? ' At their initiation, little else was required of them be sides an oath of secrecy.

Having given you an account of the most celebrated oracles in Greece, which make the first and noblest species of natural divination, I come now to the second, called in Greek Otopartsid , which is a compound word,
consisting of two parts, by which it is distinguished from all other sorts of divination ; by the former, namely, Isòs , it is distinguished from artificial
divination , which, though it may be said to be given by the gods, yet does
not immediately proceed from them , being the effect of experience and

What follows is nothing but a prolix and tedious harangue upon various subjects. One thing there is more especially remarkable in this account, viz, that he makes Timarchus to return from consultation with a brisk and
cheerful countenance, whereas, it is commonly reported that all the con sultants of this oracle became pensive and melancholy ; that their tempers were soured, and their countenances, however gay and pleasant before,
rendered dull and heavy ; whence, of any person dejected, melancholy, or too serious, it was generally said Toopwviou pepecVTEUTæl, he has been consulting the oracle of Trophonius. But this is only to be under

AMPHIARAUS was the son of Oïcleus, and married Eriphyle the sister of Adrastus, king of Argos: he was an excellent soothsayer, and by his skill
foresaw that it would prove fatal to him if he engaged in the Theban war.
Wherefore to avoid inevitable destruction, he hid himself, but was dis covered by his wife Eriphyle, whom Polynices had corrupted with a pre sent of a gold chain . Being discovered, he was obliged by Adrastus to accompany the army to Thebes, where, as he had foretold , together with
his chariot and horses, he was swallowed up by the earth . Some say this

accident happened in the way betwixt. Thebes and Chalcis: and for that
reason the place is called " Agra, a chariot, to this day .' After his death he was honoured with divine worship ; first by the Oropians, and afterwards by all the other Grecians: and a stately temple,
with a statue of white marble, was erected to him in the place where he was swallowed up, being about twelve stadia distant from Oropus, a city in the confines of Attica and Boeotia, which for that reason is sometimes attributed to both countries. There was also a remarkable altar dedicated
to him in the same place. It was divided into five parts ; the first of which was sacred to Hercules, Jupiter, and Pæonian Apollo ; the second , to the heroes and their wives ; the third , to Vesta, Mercury, Amphiaraus,
and the sons of Amphilochus (for Alemæon, the son of Amphiaraus, was
not allowed to partake of any of the honours paid to Amphilochus, or Amphiaraus, because he slew his mother Eriphyle) ; the fourth to Venus,
Panacea, Jason , Hygiea, and Pæonian Minerva : the fifth part to the Nymphs, Pan , and the rivers Achelous and Cephisus.
Answers were delivered in dreams: Jophon the Gnosian , who published the ancient oracles in heroic verse , reports, that Amphiaraus returned an answer to the Argives in verse ; but my author herein contradicts him, and reports farther, that it was the general opinion , that only those who were inspired by Apollo gave answers after that manner ; whereas all the rest made predictions either by dreams or the flight of birds, or the entrails of beasts. He adds, for a confirmation of what he had said before,
viz. that these answers were given in dreams, that Amphiaraus was excellently skilled in the interpretation of dreams, and canonized for the invention of that art.
They that came to consult this oracle, were first to be purified by offering sacrifice to Amphiaraus, and all the other gods, whose names
were inscribed on the altar : 2 they were to fast twenty- four hours, and abstain three days from wine. After all, they offered a ram in sacrifice
to Amphiaraus; then went to sleep, lying upon a victim's skin , and in that posture expected a revelation by dream. In the same manner did the people of Apulia Daunia expect answers from Podalirius, who died there, and returned prophetic dreams to those that came to inquire of him .
Whoever consulted him was to sleep upon a sheep's skin at his altar." To return : all persons were admitted to this oracle, the Thebans only excepted, who were to enjoy no benefit from Amphiaraus in this way ;" for he gave them their option of two things, viz. his counsel and advice, to direct them in time of necessity, or his help and protection , to defend them in time of danger, telling them they must not expect both : where
upon they chose the latter, thinking they had a greater need of defence
than counsel, which they could be sufficiently furnished with by Delphian Apollo.

observation . By the latter, namely , haytside, it is opposed to oracular
divination ; for though martsíc be a general name, and sometimes signify
any sort of divination, yet it is also used in a more strict and limited
sense , to denote those predictions that are made by men ; and in this acceptation it is opposed to χρησμός..!

because

.
As to the manner of receiving the divine inspiration, that was not
always different; for not only the Pythia, but the Sybils also, with many
others, were possessed with divine fury, swelling with rage, like persons distracted and beside themselves.

Few that pretended to inspiration but raged after this manner, foaming,
and making a strange, terrible noise , gnashing with their teeth, shivering and trembling, with other antic motions; and therefore some will have
their name, namely, płytis, to be derived årò toū palveolau, from being mad .
Other customs there were, common to them with the Pythia ; I shall only mention those about the laurel, which was sacred to Apollo, the god
of divination , being sprung from his beloved Daphne, and thought to con duce very much to inspiration, and therefore called jartındy Purdy, the prophetic plant. With this they used to crown their heads. Thus Cas
sandra is described by Euripides . And Æschyluss speaks thus of her : Και σκήπτρα , και μαντεία περί δέρη στέφη .

Where, by oxñarpov, he means a staff of laurel, which prophets usually
carried in their hands; it was called in Greek idurthgrov, as we learn from Hesychius. It was also usual to eat the leaves of this tree ; whence Lyco phron says of Cassandra : 6
Δαφνηφάγων φοίβαζαν εκ λαιμών ύπα.. The mouth with laurel morsels oft replete, In mystic words unriddled future late.
And the Sibyl in Tibullus speaks of it as one of her greatest privileges, placing it in the same rank with that of virginity ,' a thing held by her very sacred , though not always observed by other prophets ; for Cassandra
was Agamemnon's concubine; and though the condition of a captive

might lay some force upon her, yet it is agreed by all, that Helenus mar ried Andromache; and that blind Tiresias was led up and down by his daughter Manto.
It was also customary for diviners to feed upon the κυριώτατα μόρια ζώων partix @ v, principal parts of the prophetical beasts ; such were the hearts
of crows, vultures, and moles, thinking that by these they became partakers
of the souls of those animals, which by a natural attraction followed the bodies, and by consequence received the influence of the god, who used to accompany the souls, 1
Thus much of these prophets in general. I shall only add, that they, as also other diviners, were maintained at Athens at the public charge,
having their diet allowed in the ligutavsīov, or common hall.2 Of the Joueértus there were three sorts among the Greeks, distin guished by three distinct manners of receiving the divine affatus.
One sort were possessed with prophesying demons, which lodged within them , and dictated what they should answer to those that inquired of them ,
or spoke out of the bellies or breasts of the possessed persons, they all the while remaining speechless, and not so much as moving their tongues or
lips, or pronounced the answers themselves, making use of the members of the demoniac. These were called despovóanTTO , possessed with
dæmons ; and because the spirits either lodged or spoke within their bodies, they were also named šyyaorgizubos, which name was also attri
buted to the demons , έγγαστριμάντεις, στερνoμάντεις , εγγαστρίται, &c. This way of prophesying was practised also in other countries, and parti cularly amongst the Jews; as also necromancy ; for the prophet Isaiah denounced God's judgments upon those that made use of either of them .” His words, as they are translated by the Seventy, run thus : Kai įày simwi
προς υμάς, ζητήσατε τους εγγαστριμύθους , και τους από της γης φωνούντας, τους κενολογούντας , οι εκ της κοιλίας φωνούσιν ουκ έθνος προς θεόν αυτού έκζη τήσουσι ; τί εκζητούσι περί των ζώντων τους νεκρούςκαι And if they say unto you , seek unto them whose speech is in their belly, and those that speak out
of the earth, those that utter vain words, that speak out of their belly : shall not a nation seek unto their god ? Why do they inquire of the dead con
cerning the living ? These diviners were also named Eigurasis and Ey puxasītas, from Eurycles, the first that practised this art at Athens ; and IIúbwves, and Ilutwixoà, from Iúlwv, a prophesying demon, as Hesychius and Suidas have told us : the same is mentioned in the acts of the Apos
tles : 'Εγένετο δε πορευομένων ημών εις προσευχήν, παιδίσκην τινά έχουσαν
πνεύμα Πύθωνος, άπαντήσαι ημίν. Our translators have rendered it thus : And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel, possessed
with a spirit of divination , met us . But the margin reads python , instead
of divination , which is a general name, and may be used in that place, as more intelligible by the common people. Plutarch, in his treatise con

cerning the cessation of oracles, says these familiar spirits were anciently called Evquxacīs, and TIúbwrss only in latter ages : ' It is absurd ,' says he, 6 and childish , to suppose that the god himself, like the 'Eyyuorgíuubos, which were formerly called Eugurācīs, but are now named Júlwyss, should enter into the bodies of prophets, and make use of their mouths and voices
in pronouncing their answers.' As to the origin of this name (python) there are various conjectures ; the most probable of which seems to be, that it was taken from Apollo
Pythius, who was thought to preside over all sorts of divination, and after
wards appropriated by custom to this species ; for so we find a great many words of a general signification, in time made peculiar to some one part
of what they signified before. To give one instance, Túpavvos, by the ancient Greeks, was applied to all kings, as well the just and merciful, as
the cruel, and whom we now call tyrannical; but in more modern ages was appropriated to that latter sort, and became a name of the greatest
ignominy and detestation . On the contrary , words of a narrow and limited sense have sometimes passed their bounds, and taken upon them a more general and unconfined one : so Martzia , which at first signified only that sort of prophesying which was inspired with rage and fury , being derived , as Plato and others after him will have it, &TÒ TOû pecíveolan, from being
mad, and by Homer ,' in that sense opposed to some other ways of divina tion , as that by dreams and entrails, came at length to be a general name for all sorts of divination .
The second sort of Θεομάνσεις were called 'Ενθουσιασται, 'Ενθεαστικοί, and OLOTYEUTTA ), being such as pretended to what we also call enthusiasm ; and different from the former, who contained within them the deity himself;
whereas these were only governed, actuated , or inspired by him, and in structed in the knowledge of what was to happen . Of this sort were
Orpheus, Amphion, Musæus, and several of the Sibyls. A third sort were the ' ExoTatixo , or those that were cast into trances
or ecstasies, in which they lay like men dead or asleep , deprived of all sense and motion ; but after some time it may be days, or months, or
years, for Epimenides, the Cretan, is reported to have lain in this posture seventy - five years ), returning to themselves, gave strange relations of what
they had seen and heard . For it was a vulgar opinion , that man's soul might leave the body, wander up and down the world, visit the place of
the deceased, and the heavenly regions, and by conversing with the gods and heroes be instructed in things necessary for the conduct of human life.
Plato, in the tenth book of his Politics, speaks of one Pamphilus, a Phæ rean , who lay ten days amongst the carcases of slain men, and afterwards
being taken up, and placed upon the funeral pile to be burned, returned to life, and related what places he had seen in heaven, earth, and hell, and what was done there, to the astonishment of all that heard him. And

Plutarch , in his discourse concerning Socrates's demon, says, it was re ported of the soul of Hermodorus the Clazomenian , that for several nights and days it would leave his body, travel over many countries, and return
after it had viewed things, and discoursed with persons at a great distance, till at last, by the treachery of a woman , his body was delivered to his enemies, who burned the house while the inhabitant was abroad . Several
other stories of the same nature are recorded in history ; which , whether true or false, it matters not much, since they were believed and received as such .
Hither may also be reduced another sort of divination . It was com monly believed that the souls of dying men, being then in a manner loosed from the body, could foresee future events. Whence Hector is introduced
by Homer ,2 foretelling to Achilles the authors and place of his death ; and
Orodes, by Virgil, foretelling the death of Mezentius. I will only men tion one example more, which is related by Cicero,* concerning Calanus,
the Indian philosopher, who, being asked by Alexander, whether he had a mind to speak any thing before his death, replied, Optime, propediem te
videbo : Yes, I shall see you shortly.' Quod ita contigit ; which accord ingly, says Cicero, came to pass. Thus much for natural divination. I come in the next place to speak something of that which is called artificial. In doing which, because
divination, or prediction by dreams, seems to bear a more near affinity to
the natural thạn the rest, and is by some reckoned amongst the species of it, I shall, therefore, in the first place, give you an account of the customs practised in it.

under any assumed form , conversed with men in their sleep : of this sort was Agamemnon's dream at the beginning of the second Iliad ; where the
god of dreams, in the form of Nestor, advises him to give the Trojans
battle, and encourages him with the promise of victory. Such also was the dream of Pindar ,' in which Proserpine appeared to him and complained that he had dealt unkindly with her, having composed hymns in honour of all the other gods, while he had neglected her : she added , that when he came into her dominions, he should celebrate her praises also. Not many days after, the poet died, and in a short time appeared to an old woman ,
a relation of his, that used to employ a great part of her time in reading and singing his verses, and repeated to her a hymn he had composed in honour of Proserpine.
The second is " Ogeegee, wherein the images of things which are to hap pen are plainly represented in their own shape and likeness : and this is
by some called Oswanua tıxós. Such was that of Alexander the Great," when he dreamed that he was to be murdered by Cassander ; and that of Croesus, king of Lydia, when he dreamed that his son Atys, whom he designed to succeed him in his empire, should be slain by an iron spear.?
The third species, called "Oveigos, is that in which future events are re vealed by types and figures; wh it is named 'Aaangogoxos, an allegory,
• a figure by which one thing is expressed and another signified. Of this sort was Hecuba’s, when she dreamed she had conceived a firebrand ; and Cæsar's, when he dreamed that he lay with his mother ; which signified that he should enjoy the empire of the earth, the common mother of all living creatures. From this species, those whose profession it was to in terpret dreams have derived their names, being called in Greek ' Ovsigoxgí ται , 'Ονειράτων υποκριται, from judging of dreams : 'Ονειροσκόποι, from prgy ing and looking into them ; and ’Ovsigoróhow, because they were conversant about them. To one of these three sorts may all prophetical dreams be reduced : but the distinction of their names is not always critically ob
served . The first author of all dreams, as well as of other divinations, was Ju
piter : -- και γάρ τ' όναρ εκ Διός έστιν. For dreams, too, come from Jove. 5
But this must not be understood as if dreams were thought to proceed
immediately from Jupiter; it was below his dignity to descend to such mean offices, which were thought more fit for inferior deities .
To omit therefore the apparitions of the gods, or spirits in dreams, upon particular occasions, such as was that of Patroclus' ghost to Achilles,6 to
desire his body might be interred ; the earth was thought to be the cause
of dreams :? --ώ πότνια Χθών ,, Hail, venerable Earth , from whom

because the earth, by obstructing the passage of the light of the sun , causes the night in which dreams present themselves, which are on this account imputed to the earth as their mother. Or, because out of the earth pro ceeds meat, meat causes sleep ( sleep, being nothing but the ligation of the exterior senses, caused by humid vapours ascending from the stomach to the brain, and there obstructing the motion of the animal spirits, which
are the instruments of sensation , and all other animal operations), and from sleep come dreams: but these were esteemed mere cheats and delu
sions . Of such as these Homer speaks, when he makes dreams to inhabit near the ocean , the great receptacle of the humid element.2 Others were ascribed to infernal ghosts. Hence Sophocles brings in
Electra, saying that Agamemnon, out of a concern for Orestes and his designs, haunted Clytemnestra with fearful dreams.A Others were imputed to Hecate, and to the Moon , who were goddesses of the night, and were sometimes taken for the same person : they were
also supposed to have a particular influence, and to preside over all the accidents of the night, and therefore were invoked at incantations, and other night mysteries. But the chief cause of all was the god of sleep, whose habitation was
among the Cimmerii, in a den dark as hell, and in the way to it ; around
him lay whole swarms of dreams of all sorts and sizes, which he sent forth when and whither he pleased. Virgil assigns to the false and deluding
dreams another place, upon an elm at the entrance of hell. It may be , he
supposes this to have been the receptacle of some part of them , and the rest to accompany the god of sleep . He had three attendants, more ingenious than the rest, who could transform themselves into any form ; their names
were Morpheus, Phobetor or Icelos, and Phantasus : the employment of the first was to counterfeit the forms of men, the second imitated the like ness of brutes, and the last that of inanimate creatures.
In Virgil, the god of sleep descended from heaven upon Palinurus ; which is not to be understood as if heaven was his proper seat, but that he
was sent thence by some of the ethereal gods, by whom he had been called thither; or else he is to be supposed to rove up and down through the heavens, or air, to disperse his dreams among men as he sees convenient .
There was another deity also, to whom the care of dreams was com mitted , called Brizo, from the old Greek word Beiệuv, to sleep :' she was
worshipped in the island Delos, and boats full of all sorts of things, except fish, were offered to her. But she was thought rather to assist at the in terpretation of dreams, than to be the efficient cause of them , and is
therefore sometimes called BpisódcytoS. The Greeks used to pray to her
for the public safety and prosperity ; but more particularly, that she would vouchsafe to protect and preserve their ships.10

Lastly, it was believed that hawks, or vultures (sépaxss), when they were dead, did μαντεύεσθαι και ονείρατα επιπέμπειν, prophes and send dreams και being then divested of their bodies, and' become yugerah luxai, naked souls.2
There were two ways by which dreams were supposed usually to come ; one for delusive dreams, which passed through a gate of ivory, another for the true, which passed through a gate of horn ."
In allusion to these gates, it was customary to represent any dream in a white garment, wrapped over a black one, with a horn in his hand.3
The time in which true dreams were expected' was Nuxtos deporgós: and therefore Penelope, having an auspicious dream concerning her son Telemachus, who was travelling in search of his father Ulysses, rejoiced' the more, because it appeared to her at that time,4 What time that was grammarians are not agreed : some derive it from the privative particle a
and μολέω, to walk, or μογέω, to labour and toil , as though it were άμoλος or äroyos, and by epenthesis, duongos, as though it should signify the dead of the night, in which people neither labour nor walk abroad. Others
also think it may signify the middle or depth of the night, but for a differ ent reason : for ponyos, say they, is the same with auxvòs, thick or close compacted ; and Hesiod hath used the word in this sense , when he says, Μάζα τ' αμολγαίη
That is, Tollesvern újpesaía, a thick cake, such as the shepherds and labour ing men eat. Others allow it the same signification, but for a third reason :
åmorgos, say they, according to the glossographers, amongst the Achæans, is the same with axun, which signifies the midst or height of any thing,
as úxuain I égous, that part of summer when the height is most violent, midsummer ; and men are said to be tv expiñ, when they are in their fuil
strength ; and therefore αμολγος , or ακμή νυκτός must be the depth or midst of the night. But this signification concerns not our present pur
pose, for I nowhere read that dreams had more credit because they came in the dead of the night. It must therefore be observed, that isoagos was
used in another sense ; for the time in which they used to milk cattle,
being derived from αμίλγω , to milk ; and then αμολγος νυκτός must sig
nify the time of milking in the morning, in opposition to nu'égas iponyès, or the evening milking -time. That it was used in this sense is evident
from Homer's twenty -second Iliad, where he says the dog-star, which rises a little before the sun, appears įy yoxtos époagą.5 And Horáce assures us that this was the time in which dreams were
thought to deserve the greatest regard . Ovid appears to be of the same opinion, and Theocritus agrees with them .
The reason of which opinion was this, namely, they thought all the

remainders of the meat upon their stomachs might by that time be pretty
well digested and gone ; for till then dreams were believed rather to pro ceed from the fumes of the last night's supper than any divine or superna
tural cause ; and therefore Pliny tells us, a dream is never true presently after
eating or drinking; and Artemidorus farther observes, that small credit is to be given to a morning dream , if you have eaten too plentifully the night because all the crudities cannot then be carried off.
For that reason , they who desired a prophetic dream, used to take a special care of their diet, so as to eat nothing hard of digestion, as parti cularly beans, or raw fruit. Some, that they might be sure to be free from fumes, fasted one day before, and abstained from wine for three .
Fish is not soon or easily digested, and therefore, it is probable, was thought to obstruct true dreams, which seems to have been the reason why, when such quantities of other things were offered in sacrifice to the god dess Brizo, fish only were excepted. Plutarch observes, that the head of the polypus was prejudicial to those who desired prophetical dreams, be cause it is sweet and pleasant to the taste, but disquiets men in their sleep, and makes them restless, causing troublesome and anxious dreams : and therefore he compares poetry to it, which contains many things, both pro
fitable and pleasant to those that make a right use of it ; but to others is very prejudicial, filling their heads with vain, if not impious notions and opinions. In short, all things apt to burden the stomach, to put the blood into a ferment, and the spirits into too violent a motion ; all things apt to create strange imaginations, to disturb men's rest, or to hinder in any way the free and ordinary operations of the soul, were to be avoided ; that
so the mind and fancy being pure, and without any unnatural or external impressions, might be the fitter to receive divine insinuations. Some choice there was also in the colour of their clothes : Suidas tells us, it was most proper to sleep in a white garment, which was thought to make the dreams and visions the clearer.
Besides all this, before they went to bed, they used to sacrifice to Mer cury . The Calasiris in Heliodorus, after he had prayed to all the rest
of the gods, calls upon Mercury to give him súóvsugou vúxta, a night of good dreams. Mercury was thought to be őtyou doting, the giver of sleep : and therefore they usually carved his image upon the feet of the bed ,
which were for that reason called équives. Others will have iquis to be derived from squa, a prop , or support, because by it the bed was up held or supported. However that be, certain it is, that one of Mercury's
employments was to preside over sleep and dreams, and the night also, with all things which belong to it.3
After all this preparation , they went to sleep, expecting to discover whatever they were solicitous about before the morning: but if their fate was revealed in obscure or allegorical terms, so that themselves could not dive into their meaning, then an interpreter was consulted . The first of

this kind was Amphictyon, Deucalion's son. Pausanias would have it to
be Amphiaraus, who had divine honours paid him, for the invention of that art. Others ascribe it to the inhabitants of Telmissus ;2 but whoever
was the author of it, it is certain , that amongst the ancient Greeks it
had very great credit, as appears from the number of books written con cerning it. Geminus Pyrius composed three books upon this subject ; Artemon the Milesian two and twenty ; besides Panyasis the Halicarnas sean , Alexander the Myndian, Phoebus the Antiochian , Demetrius the Phalerean, Nicostratus the Ephesian , Antipho the Athenian, Artemidorus, Astrampsychus, Philo Judæus, Achines the son of Scyrimus, Nicephorus,
&c. Yet it was never in so great request as the other species of divina
tion . The many false and frivolous dreams which happen to every man cast a suspicion upon all the rest ; and those which were nothing but delu sions made the truly ( dióTEUTTOI) prophetical to be called in question ; and therefore, when the hero in Homer 3 advises the Greeks to inquire of
some prophet, what means they should use to appease the anger of the gods, he speaks boldly , and without hesitation, of pávtis, or the inspired
prophet ; and isgeüs, or him that consulted the entrails of victims offered in
sacrifice (for so isgsùs must signify in that place); but when he comes to óveigosóros, or the interpreter of dreams, he is forced to make a sort of an apology in this manner :
'Αλλ' άγε δή τινα μάντιν έρείομεν, ή ιερήα, * Η και ονειροπόλον , καί γάρ τ ' όναρ εκ Διος έστιν. Bat let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
Explore the cause of great Apollo's rage ; Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove, By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.
POPE
.
Whereby he anticipates a question, which he foresaw might be proposed
to him thus :—Why should we ask counsel of one whose business is only to expound these delusions ? why should we trust the safety of the whole
army in the hands of a cunning impostor ? To this he answers, that in deed there were many false and deceitful dreams; yet some also were true,
and came from Jupiter, the common father of all prophetical predictions, and therefore might be depended upon . In later ages, dreams came to be
little regarded, except by old doting women , who were very superstitious in observing them.4
In more remote ages, the people who lived near the Gades, and Borys thenes, and the inhabitants of Telmissus and Hybla Gereatis, a city be
longing to the Cataneans, in Sicily, were famed for their skill in this art .
When any frightful or obscure dream appeared , the dreamer used to disclose his fears to some of the gods, offering incense, or some other
oblation; and praying, that if good was portended, it might be brought to pass : if the contrary, that the gods would avert it. This telling of dreams was not appropriated to any particular deity. Some discovered them to
Hercules, others to Jupiter, others to the household gods, because they

were nearest at hand , and were thought to have a peculiar concern and
care for the family in which they were worshipped, and particularly to Vesta.
Apollo also had a peculiar title to this worship , under the name of
Egansorágios, ' Aforgézavos, or Averruncus ; from averting evils, and Ilpootarúgios, from presiding over and protecting houses ; on which ac count, he had images erected to him in the porches. Whence in Sopho
cles, Clytemnestra having seen a terrible dream , calls upon her woman thus.2

But before that, she had discovered her fears to the Sun, whence Chrysa themis learned the dream from one that overheard her : 3

Both the scholiasts upon that place tell us that it was done conformably to the ancient custom of relating dreams to the Sun ; and Triclinius gives
this reason for it, viz. that the Sun being contrary to the Night, averted or expelled all the evils which proceeded from it. The same we find doue by Iphigenia in Euripides,4 with this difference, that she discloses her thoughts to the heavens, whereas Clytemnestra had done it to the Sun
alone . The doing this they called αποπέμσεσθαι, αποδιοπομπείσθαι, and αποτρέπεσθαι έννυχον όψιν, or αποτροπιάζεσθαι τώ ηλίω, &c.
But before they were permitted to approach the divine altars, they were obliged to purify themselves from all the pollutions of the night ; by wash ing the body, or at least the hands, in some running stream .” Amongst the Romans it was usual to dip their heads five times in water before morning prayer.

Somewhat
also
was
observed
in
the
wagging
of
the
tail
;
whence
the
poet
says,
The victim kindly wags his tail.
On this account it was usual to draw a knife from the victim's head to its
tail. Other predictions were made from the tail, when cast into the fire ; when it was curled by the flame, it portended misfortunes ; when it was
extended out in length and hung downward, it was an omen of some over throw to be suffered ; but when erected , it signified victory .*
After this, the victim being cut open, they made observations from its entrails ; these were termed én tupa , from the fire wherein they were burned. The omens were called by Plato và trupa anuata , and the
divination was distinguished by the name of ý difutúgwe partsía. By some it was feigned to have been first occasioned , or very much improved, by the death of the Delphian Sibyl, whose body being reduced to earth ,
imparted first to the herbs, and by their means to the beasts which fed on them , a power of divining : as also those other parts of her, which, mixed with the air, are said to have occasioned the divination by ominous words. If the entrails were whole and sound , had their natural place,
colour, and proportion , then all was well ; but if any part was decayed, or

.
wanting ; if any thing was out of order, or not according to nature , evil
was portended.1 The palpitation of the entrails was a very unfortunate omen ?
The first and principal part to be observed was the liver : if this was
corrupted, they thought that both the blood , and by consequence all the body must be so too ; and therefore if it was found very bad, they desisted
immediately, not heeding what the other parts might promise: these signs were called åréasule, as hindering them from going any farther. This
observing of the liver was called 'HTATOPKOFic, which also became a general name for divination by entrails, being the chief part of it. If the liver
had a pleasing and natural redness ; if it was sound, without spot or ble mish ; if its head was large, if it had two heads, or there were two livers ;
if its lappets were turned inwards, then prosperity and success were
expected. On the other hand, nothing but dangers, disappointments, and misfortunes were to be looked for, if there was defis, too much dryness, or dsomeos, a tie between the parts, especially if it was äroßos, without a lappet, or the liver itself was altogether wanting. Pythagoras the scoth
sayer foretold Alexander's death, örı íroßón o sò rag ñisgríou, because his victim's liver had no lobes. And his friend Hephæstion’s death was
prognosticated by the same omen . Bad signs also were accounted such as these : if there appeared upon it any blisters, wheals, or ulcers ; if it was parched, thin, hard , or of an ugly blackish colour ; had any corrupt and vitiated humours ; was in any way displaced ; or, lastly , if in boiling it
did not conspicuously appear amongst the rest of the entrails ; was polluted
with any nasty corrupt matter, became very soft, and, as it were, melted into a jelly. The concavous part of the liver was called Sotiàs, that is, belonging to the family, because the signs observed there concerned themselves and their friends; the gibbous side irißoals, or articTATIS, because the tokens in it concerned their enemies: if either of these parts
was shrivelled, corrupted , or any way changed for the worse, it boded
ruin to the person concerned in it ; but if large and sound , or bigger than usual, it was a prosperous omen . That the Romans also used this method ,
appears from Lucan, who tells us that Cæsar's victory over Pompey was foretold in this way. His words are these : Quodque nefas nullis impune apparuit extis,

OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE. 301
This was an unfortunate omen , when found compressed or closed ;
whence Dio relates, that the soothsayers warned Caracalla to take care of himself, ότι αι του ήπατος πύλαι κέκλεινται, because the gates of the liver were closed .
The next thing to be taken notice of was the heart, which, if it was
very little, palpitated much, leaped , was shrivelled, or wrinkled , or had no fat at all, portended bad fortune ; if there was no heart to be found, it
was a most deadly omen.
Next to the heart, they observed the gall, the spleen, the lungs, and the membranes in which the bowels were inclosed. If there were two galls ;
if the gall was large, and ready to burst out of its skin ; then sharp and bloody, but yet prosperous, fights were expected. If the spleen lay'in its own place, was clear and sound , of its natural colour, without wheals , hardness, or wrinkles, it boded nothing but success ; as the contrary signs
presaged misfortunes. So did also the entrails, if they chanced to slip out of the hands of him that offered the sacrifice ; if they were besmeared with
blood , of a livid colour, or spotted ; were full of blisters or pimples, filled with corrupt or salt matter, broken or torn in pieces, or stunk like putre
fied bodies. Lastly , if serpents crawling, or any thing else terrible and unusual was found in them. If the lungs were cloven , the business in hand was to be deferred ; if whole and entire, it was to be proceeded in with all possible speed and vigour.
Other
parts
of
the
victim
did
sometimes
presage
things
to
come
,

cially
if
any
thing
happened
extraordinary
,
and
contrary
to
the
common
course
of
nature
.
For
instance
,
on
the
day
that
king
Pyrrhus
was
slain
at
Argos
,
his
death
was
foretold
by
the
heads
of
the
sacrifices
,
which
being
cut
off
,
lay
licking
their
own
blood.2
Another
unlucky
omen
happened
to
Cimon
,
the
Athenian
general
,
a
little
before
his
death
;
for
when
the
priest
had
slain
the
sacrifice
according
to
custom
,
the
blood
that
ran
down
,
and
congealed
upon
the
ground
,
was
by
a
great
many
pismires
carried
to
Cimon
,
and
placed
all
together
at
his
great
toe
.
They
were
a
long
time
in
doing
this
before
any
man
perceived
them
;
but
Cimon
had
no
sooner
espied
them
out
,
but
the
augur
brought
him
word
that
the
liver
had
no
head
;
and
in
a
very
short
time
after
,
that
famous
captain
died
.
Hither are to be reduced some other ways of divination by things made use of at sacrifices ; as, first, Ilugaueantsíc , divination by the fire of the sacrifice. Good signs were such as these : if the flames immediately took hold of, and consumed the victim, seizing at once all the parts of it ; on
which account they usually prepared tà Ogúravæ, dry sticks, which would
easily take fire. Also, if the flame was bright and pure, and without noise or smoke ; if the sparks tended upward in the form of a pyramid ; if the fire went not out till all was reduced to ashes. Contrary signs were,
when it was kindled with difficulty, when the flame was divided, when it
did not immediately spread itself over all the parts of the victim , but
1 Caracalla . 2 Plin. xi. 37

creeping along, consumed them by little and little ; when , instead of
ascending in a straight line, it whirled round, turned sideways, or down wards, and was extinguished by winds, showers, or any other unlucky accident ; when it crackled more than ordinary, was black, casting forth smoke or sparks, or died before all the victim was consumed . All these, and such like omens, signified the displeasure of the gods. Some of these
signs Tiresias speaks of in Sophocles as very fatal and pernicious :
εκ δε θυμάτων But from the sacrifice no flame shone bright,
“Ηφαίστος ουκ έλαμπεν, αλλ' επί σποδα Nor vapour from the humid flesh arose ;
Μηδωσα κηκίς μηρίων ετήκετο It wastel on the ashes, and rolled low
κάτυφε, κανέπτυ ' και μετάρσιοι A dull black smoke, exuding on the fire;
Χολαι διασπείροντο, και καταρρυείς The entrails swelled and burst ; the melting thighs,
Μηροί καλυπτής εξέκειντο πιμελης.. Shrunk from the involving cauls, lay bare .
POTTER .
Sometimes, when the entrails foretold nothing certain by dissection , the priest made observations from them in the fire ; in order hereto he took
the bladder, and binding the neck of it with wool (for which reason Sopho
cles calls the bladders pecen aodérois xúotsis) put it into the fire, to observe in what place it would break, and which way it would dart the urine. Some times they took pitch off the torches, and threw it into the fire ; whence if
there arose but one entire flame, it was taken for a good omen.

frankincense, proceeded from it, it boded ill. Olvoparteia , and ' rogoleavtsía , divination by wine and by water, when conjectures were made from the colour, motion , noise, and other accidents of the wine of the libations; or the water in which the victims were

was commonly thought by the Italians to have been the first who com municated this divination to mankind. It was certainly very ancient,
and obtained so great credit amongst the Greeks, that they would desist from the greatest, and seemingly most advantageous undertakings, and attempt things most hazardous, and unlikely to be attained, if the entrails of victims dissuaded them from the former, or encouraged them to the latter. Of this we have a remarkable instance in Plutarch's life of Aristides : When Mardonius the Persian made an assault upon the Gre
cians, Pausanias the Lacedæmonian, at that time general of all the Grecian forces, offered sacrifice, and finding it not acceptable to the gods, com
manded the Lacedæmonians, laying down their shields at their feet, to abide quietly and attend his directions, making no resistance to any of their enemies. Then offering a second time, for if the first victim afforded
not auspicious omens, it was usual to offer on till they obtained what they desired, as the horse charged, one of the Lacedæmonians was wounded ; at this time also Callicrates, who by report was the most comely proper
man in the army, being shot with an arrow, and upon the point of expir ing, said that he lamented not his death ( for he came from home to lay
down his life in the defence of Greece), but that he had died without action . The cause was heard , and wonderful was the forbearance of the men ; for they repelled not the enemy that charged them, but expecting their opportunity from the gods and their general, suffered themselves to
be wounded, and slain in their ranks; and so obstinate they continued in this resolution , that though the priests offered one victim after another
without any success, and the enemy still pressed upon them, they moved
not a foot, till the sacrifices proved propitious, and the soothsayers foretold the victory .'
CHAP. XV.
OF DIVINATION BY BIRDS.
I COME, in the next place, to speak of divination by birds ; the invention
of which is by some ascribed to Prometheus, or Melampus, the son of Amythaon and Dorippe ; Pliny reports, that Car, from whom Caria
received its name, was the first that made predictions by birds; and
Orpheus by other animals :3 Pausanias tells us , that Parnassus, after whose name the mountain Parnassus was called, first observed the flight of birds.
The same, Clemens of Alexandria reports concerning the Phrygians. This art was very much improved by Calchas, who, as Homer tells us,
was
-οιωνοπόλον όχ' άριστος. Of augurs far the best.

At length it arrived at such perfection, and gained so much credit in the world , that seldom any thing of moment was undertaken , either in time
of war or peace, seldom any honours conferred , any magistrates created, without the approbation of birds; nay , other divinations were sometimes passed by unregarded , if not confirmed by them . At Lacedæmon , the
king and senate had always an augur attending upon them to advise with; and Coelius reports, that kings themselves used to study the art. The
birds, because they were continually flying about, were thought to observe, and pry into men's most secret actions, and to be acquainted with all accidents ; whence that verse of Aristophanes :2 Ουδείς οίδε τον θησαυρόν τον εμόν , πλήν είτις άρ' όρνες. Νone, but perhaps some bird , knows any thing About my treasure.
And the scholiast quotes such another saying out of him ; Ουδείς με θεωρεί, πλήν ο παριστάμενος όρνις. None sees me, but the bird that flieth by.
There is a proverb also much to the same purpose ; for when they thought themselves secure from the knowledge of all persons, they used to say,
Ουδείς οίδε τι ωμίλησα , πλήν γε είτις όρνις : none is conscious to what I have been conversing about, except perchance some bird . Aristophanes hath
introduced the birds themselves, telling what religious observance was paid them : Εσμεν δ ' υμίν "Αμμων, Δελφοί, Δωδώνη, Φοίβος 'Aπόλ. For we to you instead of Ammon are ,

The Grecian augurs were not, as the Latin , clothed in purple, or scarlet, but in white, having a crown of gold upon their heads when they made observations. They had also owotúgioy, that is, a place or seat appointed for that purpose, called sometimes by the general names of Jāros, and Jūros, as in Sophocles' Antigone, where Tiresias speaks thus :: Είς γαρ παλαιόν 95πον ορνιθοσκόπον

,
with

,
lest

.
The omens that appeared towards the east were accounted fortunate by the Greeks, Romans, and all other nations; because the great principle
of all light and heat, motion and life, diffuses its first influences from that part of the world. On the contrary, the western omens were unlucky, because the sun declines in that quarter.
The Grecian augurs, when they made observations, kept their faces towards the north, the east being upon their right hand, and the west upon
their left: that they did so appears from Homer, who brings in Hector, telling Polydamas, that he regarded not the birds :1
Elr' iri de ieri mpos TheAubr ta, Or where the suns arise, or where descend ; Είτ'επ' αριστερά τοί γε ποτί τόφον ήερόεντα . To right, to left, unheeded take your way, Ye vagrants of the sky ! your wings extend, While I the dictates of high heaven obey.-POPE.
The reason of this, as it is delivered by Plutarch, from Plato and Aris
totle, was, that sex sñs xuñosws, the beginning of the celestial motions, was in the oriental parts of the world , and that therefore these were accounted diğià Toû xóopov, the right side of the world ; and the west,
where the motion terminates, úgrotegà, the left. Hence the signs that were presented to them on the right hand were accounted fortunate, and
those on the left unlucky . On the contrary , the Romans, making obser vations with their faces towards the south , had the east upon their left
hand, and the west upon the right, of which there are innumerable proofs, which, for brevity's sake, I shall pass by, remitting such as desire farther satisfaction to Varro and other Latin authors. For this reason , whatever
was fortunate the Grecians called değiòv, the Romans sinistrum , on what
hand soever it appeared. And though the Roman poets do sometimes call things unlucky, sinistra, yet then they speak Græco more : and so
doth Virgil, when he saith ,2 Sæpe sinistra cava prædixit ab ilice cornir. By croaking from the left, presaged the coming Oft the hoarse raven, on the blasted bough,
On the contrary, Statius, though the business in hand concerned the Gre
cians, speaks more Romano, when he says in his Thebais, Signa feras, lævumque tones. Hence it came to pass , that things awkward and foolish were called sinis tra or læva ; in which sense Virgil has used this latter word :3
Sepe malum hoc nobis, si mens non læva fuisset, This, had I not been blind, I might have seen , De cælo tuctas nuernini prædicere quercus. And heaven -struck oaks my monitors have been .

Birds were fortunate, or unfortunate, either by their own nature , or by
the place and manner of their appearance ; for the same birds at different times have boded different and contrary events. The unlucky birds were called ifárasos, pernicious ; árolúpetos, hated or ungrateful ; auréaos , troublesome, from a priv . and sixw , cedo, q. non sinistræ ; i . e, non sinen
tes, because they would not permit a man to proceed in his undertakings; so sinistra, if we may believe Festus, is rather derived d sinendo, than à sinistrá manu . For the same reason they were also named xwaUTizi,
and sigxtıxai, because they restrained men from what they had designed. Those that appeared out of their wonted place, or in any unlucky place,
were called diedgas, and iğedgon, which words are peculiar to the soothsayers,
though they be sometimes applied to other things that are displaced, as when Euripides says, ibideos xbovòs, i . e. persons banished , and that had
left their own country : and fzedgos Peevão, a man distracted and out of his wits. In Hippolytus, the same phrase signifies a thing done contrary
to right reason : 2

I

of

and
the

them

whose

observed

the

:
and
the

oscines
,
which
gave
omens

their

.
First, then , if a flock of all sorts of birds came flying about any man , it
was an excellent omen , and portended some extraordinary felicity, or un expected success ; such as Diodorus Siculus observes happened to Gor dius, who, from a poor country farm , was exalted to a kingdom . The eagle, if she appeared brisk , clapping her wings, sporting about in the air, flying from the right hand to the left, was one of the best omens the gods could give ; as Niphus tells us out of Appian.3 King Priam ,
designing to go to the Grecian fleet to redeem Hector, begs of Jupiter
that he would give him assurance of his protection , by sending his beloved bird the eagle :

Aristander, observing an eagle to fly from Alexander's camp to the enemy's, foretold that Alexander should obtain the victory. Observations
also were made from the manner of taking their prey ; for instance, when Telemachus was at Sparta in search of Ulysses, an eagle came flying upon
his right hand , bearing in her talons a tame goose, which she had caught
in her roost ; from which omen Helena then foretold that Ulysses would return, surprise all Penelope's courtiers in his house, and inflict upon them the punishment they deserved. And Penelope is said to have made the
same conjecture, from an eagle that seized upon twenty geese, whilst they were feeding in her house. When an eagle dragged a fawn by the feet,
and cast it down upon Jupiter Panomphæus' altar, the Greeks, though before quite disheartened, took such courage, that they gave the Trojans a signal defeat. On the contrary, when Hector attempted to burn the
Grecian fleet, an eagle appeared towards the left hand, carrying in her talons a serpent, which made such resistance , that she, not able to convey it to her nest, was forced to let it fall; whereupon Polydamas presently foretold that Hector would be constrained to desist from his enterprise.
When Penelope's suitors waylaid Telemachus, there appeared an eagle on
the left with a dove in her talons ; and Amphinomus concluded from that omen that their design would not succeed. When two eagles appeared
tearing each other with their talons, and hovering over the assembly wherein the suitors were, Halitherses foretold that they should be all slain by Ulysses. Lastly, to mention but one instance more, an eagle, which snatched a javelin out of the hand of a soldier of Dionysius the Syracusan,
and cast it into the deep, portended the downfall and miseries that tyrant was to suffer. 3. The flight of vultures was very much observed, because, as some say,
they do but seldom appear , and their nests are rarely or never found ; wherefore a sight so unusual was thought to portend something extraordi.
nary ; or, according to Herodotus of Pontus, because vultures feed only upon carcasses, not meddling with living creatures : and therefore he tells
us, Hercules was always well pleased when a vulture appeared to him at
the undertaking of any enterprise ; because he esteemed it the most just of all the birds of prey . But Aristotle and Pliny reckon them among the unlucky birds; and add, that they were usually seen two or three days before any great slaughter ; and it was the common opinion , that vultures,
eagles, kites, and other birds of prey , if they followed an army, or con
tinued for a considerable time in any place, were certain signs of death and bloodshed .

The hawk is a ravenous bird, and an unlucky omen, portending death,
says Niphus, if she appeared seizing upon her prey ; but if the prey slipped from her, or made its escape , thereby was signified deliverance from dan gers. The buzzard , called in Greek Tgiógxns, because he has three stones, was accounted by Phoemonoë. a very ominous bird. The falcon -hawk, in Greek, Kiezos, was very lucky to people that were about marriage, or any money -business. This bird was sacred to Apollo, as Homer tells us ;? and
when Telemachus was solicitous in mind about his mother's suitors,
apppeared in this manner :
“Ως άρα οι ειπόντι επέπτατο δεξιός όρνις, His deathful pounces tore a trembling dove ; Κίρκος, Απόλλωνος ταχύς άγγελος, εν δε πόδεσσι The clotted feathers scattered from above, Τίλλε πέλειαν έχων, κατά δε πτερά χεύεν έραζε

Thick plumage, mingled with a sanguine shower. Thus speaking, on the rightupeoar'd in air, The hawk, Apollo's swift-wing'd messenger ;
By which Theoclymenus foretold that Telemachus should prevail over his enemies,
Swallows flying about, or resting upon a place, were an unlucky omen .
In Darius' expedition against Scythia, the appearance of them presaged the total defeat of his army by the Scythians. The same birds, sitting upon Pyrrhus' tent, and Anthony's ship, are said to have signified the overthrow of the armies of both those generals.
Owls were for the most part looked upon to be unlucky birds, but at Athens were omens of victory and success, being sacred to Minerva, the protectress of that city ; and therefore the proverb, raajž TTATAI, was usually applied to persons whose undertakings met with success. Plutarch 3
reports, that when Themistocles was consulting with the other officers
upon the uppermost deck of the ship, and most of them opposed him , being
unwilling to hazard a battle, an owl coming upon the right side of the ship,
and lighting upon the mast, so animated them , that they unanimously concurred with him, and prepared themselves for the fight. But in other
places 4 owls were unlucky omens when they appeared to men going about any serious business ; an instance of which we have in king Pyrrhus, whose inglorious death at Argos was portended by an owl, which came and sat upon the top of his spear, as he held it in his hand. And for this
reason , when Diomedes and Ulysses went as spies to the Trojan camp,
though it was night, the most proper time for owls to appear in, yet Homer reports, that Minerva gave them a lucky omen, by sending an ipwdios, or heron :
Toίσι δε δεξιν ήκεν ερωδιόν εγγύς οδοίο As they were marching on, a lucky heron
Ilaldus 'Aonvain.
Where Eustathius says that this bird was a token of success to men that lay in ambush, or were engaged in any such secret designs. Yet owls
were not at all times esteemed inauspicious, as appears from Hieron, at

whose first admission into military service, an eagle came and sat upon his shield , and an owl upon his spear ; by which was signified that he should be valiant in war, and wise in council, and at length arrive to the dignity of a king. This story you may find in Justin , at the end of his third book .
The dove in Homer is a lucky bird ; so also was the swan , especially to mariners, being an omen of fair weather, for which we have a reason in
Æmilius, as he is cited by Niphus: Cygnus in auspiciis semper lætissimus ales : The mariner, when toss'd by angry seas, Hunc optant nautæ , quia nunquam mergit in undis. Straight for a swan , the luckiest omen , prays ; For spite of tempests she upon the surface stays.
Ravens were very much observed, being thought to receive a power of portending future events from Apollo, to whom they were ingoà xaà ixóaou
bos, sacred and companions . When they appeared about an army, they were dangerous omens : if they came croaking upon the right hand, it was a tolerably good omen ; if on the left, a very bad one ; as also the chatter
ing of magpies seems to have been . When Alexander entered into Baby lon , and Cicero fled from Anthony, their deaths were foretold by the noise of ravens : and these birds alone were thought to understand their own
predictions, because, as Pliny affirms, 2 the worst omens were given by them, when they made a harsh sort of noise, rattling in their throats, as if they were choked .
Cocks were also accounted prophetical, especially in matters of war, for they were sacred to Mars, and therefore are called by Aristophanes ' Agéos YSOTTO), and were usually offered in sacrifice to him, and pictured with him. The crowing of cocks was an auspicious omen, and presaged Themistocles'
victory over the Persians; in memory whereof he instituted an annual feast, called 'Alextquów krwy, which was observed by fighting cocks in the theatre . And that signal victory, wherein the Boeotians overthrew the
Lacedæmonians, was foretold by the crowing of cocks some whole nights before, which was interpreted to be an omen of success ; because the cock,
when he is overcome, sits silent and melancholy ; but when he obtains the victory, struts and crows, and, as it were, triumphs over his vanquished enemy. On the contrary, if a hen was heard to crow, they thought some dreadful judgment was hanging over their heads. Thus I have given a short account of the principal birds that were esteemed ominous. There were several others by which they made pre
dictions, and several other ways of foretelling, from those I have already mentioned ; but what I have said is, I think, sufficient; and therefore shall not be much farther tedious to you. Only I must not forget to add,
that some pretended to understand the language of birds, and thereby to be privy to the most secret transactions; such a one was the famous magi cian Apollonius the Tyanean, of whom it is reported, that as he was sitting in a parlour with his friends, there came a sparrow , and chattered

to a flock of birds that were before the window : Apollonius, having heard the noise, said, she invited them to a feast, at such a certain place , where a mule loaded with corn had let his burden fall; the company, desirous to
know the truth of the business, rose up immediately, went to the place, and found it as he had told them . Democritus also was a pretender to
this art, and gave out, that he could teach others the method of attaining it ; which he did by telling them the names of certain birds, out of a mix
ture of whose blood a serpent would proceed ; which, being eaten, would,
without any farther trouble, inspire into them this knowledge. It is also feigned that Melampus arrived at this art by having his ears licked by
dragons. Such another story Eustathius relates of Helenus and Cassan dra, the children of Priam, the Trojan king, namely , that being left in
Apollo's temple, serpents came to them , and rounding themselves about their ears, made them so quick of hearing, that they could discover the counsels and designs of the gods. I must add one thing more out of
Apuleius, namely, that when any unlucky night-birds, as owls, swallows, hats, &c. got into a house, to avert the bad omen they took especial care
to catch them , and hang them before their doors, that so the birds them
selves might undergo or atone for those evils, which they had threatened to the family.

Bees were esteemed an omen of future eloquence, as appears from the
story of Plato ; for as he lay in the cradle, bees are said to have come and
sat upon his lips ; whereupon the augurs foretold that he should be famous for sweetness of language and delightful eloquence. And Pindar is said
to have been exposed , and nourished by bees with honey instead of milk . Other things also were foretold by them : but the Romans esteemed them an unlucky and very dreadful omen, as may be found in Plutarch's life of Brutus. Before Pompey's defeat, peshvorwv ionos éxi Tois Bwuołę ixébics, a swarm of bees sat upon the altar.2 There was a locust, green, and slow in motion, called Máypes, which was observed in soothsaying, as Suidas takes notice. Toads were accounted lucky omens. Snakes also, and serpents, were ominous, as appears by the serpent that, in Homer's second Iliad, devoured eight young sparrows
with their dam ; which was by Calchas interpreted to signify, that the

whole
years.
Boars
were
unlucky
omens
,
boding
an
unhappy
event
to
all
the
designs
of
persons
that
met
them
.
I
shall
mention
but
one
more
,
namely
,
the
hare
,
a
most
timorous
animal
;
and
therefore
appearing
in
time
of
war
,
it
signified
vanquishment,
and
running
away
:
when
Xerxes
had
prepared
a
vast
army
to
invade
Greece
,
it
happened
that
a
mare
brought
forth
a
hare
;
which
prodigy
was
a
presage
of
Xerxes'
base
and
cowardly
flight,
after
his
fleet
was
destroyed
by
Themistocles
.
I
come,
in
the
last
place
,
to
the
omens
from
heaven
.
I
do
not
mean
those
by
which
philosophers
and
astrologers
made
their
predictions,
but
such
as
were
usually
observed
by
the
common
people
;
such
were
comets
,
which
were
always
thought
to
portend
something
dreadful
.
Such
also
were
eclipses
of
the
sun
or
moon
,
with
which
several
armies
have
been
so
terrified
,
that
they
durst
not
engage
their
enemies
,
though
upon
never
so
great
advantages
.
Nicias,
the
Athenian
general,
being
surrounded
on
every
side
by
his
enemies
,
was
struck
into
such
a
conster
nation
by
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
,
that
he
commanded
his
soldiers
to
lay
down
their
arms,
and
so
,
together
with
a
numerous
army
,
tamely
yielded
up
himself
to
the
slaughter
.
For
the
true
cause
of
them
being
unknown
,
they
were
imputed
to
the
immediate
operation
of
the
gods,
that
were
thought
thereby
to
give
notice
of
some
signal
and
imminent
calamity
;
and
so
strongly
were
the
vulgar
possessed
with
this
opinion
,
that
Anaxagoras
brought
himself
into
no
small
danger
by
pretending
to
assign
the
natural
reason
for
them
.
Lightnings
also
were
observed
;
and
if
they
appeared
on
the
right
hand
,
were
accounted
good
omens
,
but
it
on
the
left
,
unlucky
;
as
Eustathius
has
observed
in
his
comment
upon
the
second
Iliad
;
where
Nestor
tells
the
Grecians
,
earnestly
desiring
to
return
into
their
own
country
,
that
Jupiter
had
made
a
promise
that
they
should
take
Troy
,
and
confirmed
it
by
lightning
:

δεξι
'
έναΐσιμα
σήματα
φαίνων
.
By
ominous
lightning
gave
the
lucky
sign
.
Other
meteors
also
were
observed
by
the
soothsayers
,
as
the
ignis
lam
bens,
which
was
an
excellent
omen
,
presaging
future
felicity
,
as
appears
from
Servius
Tullius,
whose
promotion
to
the
kingdom
of
Rome
was
fore
told
by
it
.
The
Argonauts,
in
their
expedition
to
Colchis,
were
overtaken
by
a
dangerous
tempest
,
near
the
Sigean
promontory
;
whereupon
Orpheus
made
supplication
to
the
gods
for
their
deliverance
:
a
little
after
,
there
appeared
two
lambent
flames
about
the
heads
of
Castor
and
Pollux
;
and
upon
this
ensued
a
gentle
gale
,
the
storm
ceasing
,
and
the
sea
becoming
calm
and
still
.
This
sudden
alteration
begot
in
the
company
a
belief,
that
the
two
brethren
had
some
divine
power
and
efficacy
,
by
which
they
were
able
to
still
the
raging
of
the
sea
;
insomuch
that
it
became
a
custom
for
mariners
,
whenever
they
were
in
any
dangerous
storms
,
to
invoke
their

assistance. If the two flames, which, from this story , are called by the
names of the two heroes, appeared together, they were ever after esteemed an excellent omen , foreboding good weather ; and therefore Theocritus, in
his hymn upon the Dioscuri, praises them for delivering poor seamen, ready to be swallowed up by the deep .
Horace speaks to the same purpose , calling these two meteors stellæ , or stars,
If one flame appeared single, it was called Helena, and was a very dan gerous omen, portending nothing but storms and shipwrecks, especially if it followed Castor and Pollux by the heels, and, as it were , drove them away. Though Euripides, in his Orestes, makes them all prosperous and desirable signs, where, speaking of Helena, he says,
Ζηνός γαρ ούσαν ζην νιν άφθετον χρεών,, For being sprung from Jove, she needs must be Κάστορί το Πολυδεύκει τ' εν αιθέρος πτυχαίς Immortal too , and with her brethren share Σύνθακος έσται ναυτίλους σωτήριος. The heavenly regions, where her glorious beams Will shine alike, to help the mariner,
Earthquakes were unfortunate omens. Hence Seneca , among other
direful presages, mentions an earthquake :? Lucus tremiscit, tota succusso sulo Nutavit aula , dubia quo pondus daret, Acfluctuanti similis.
Earthquakes were commonly thought to be caused by Neptune, who is hence termed ' Evodiyalos, and 'Evvoolgbw , by the poets: and therefore it was usual to sing pæans, and to offer sacrifices, on such occasions, to avert his anger. This we find was done by the Lacedæmonians. A gulf being opened at Rome, Curtius leaped into it to appease the angry gods. And
the same occasion happening at Celænæ , a city of Phrygia, king Midas cast many things of great value, and at length his own son into the gulf, by the command of an oracle ."
The
winds
also
were
thought
to
contain
in
them
something
prophetical,
and
were
taken
notice
of
in
soothsaying
.
Many
others
might
be
added
;

one
more
,

,
the

the

and

was

To avert unlucky omens given by thunder, it was usual to make a liba tion of wine, pouring it forth in cups. And they stood in so much fear of
lightning, that they adored it. They endeavoured to avert its malignant influences, by hissing and whistling at it, which they called SOFTúčely, as appears from Aristophanes,3 when he says, xğu zvaotgáfw, if I cast forth lightning, ToTútovor, they will hiss ; where the scholiast observes, that it
was usual ταϊς αστραπαϊς ποππύζειν, to hiss at the lightning . In places which had suffered by thunder, altars were erected, and oblations made, to avert the anger of the gods; and after that, no man adventured to touch or approach them . Hence Artemidorus observes, that by the thunder obscure places were made irionul, remarkable, by reason of the altars and sacrifices which were there presented to the gods; and that, on the con
trary, places which had been frequented, became ignjece raà őßeta , desert and solitary ; videls gàę šv aútois dergíbarv ft. Jasr because no man would , after that accident, stay there. At Rome, places affected by thun der were inclosed by a public officer ; and the fragments of the thunder
bolt, if any such could be found, were carefully buried, lest any person should be polluted by touching them. And it was farther customary to
atone for any thing, which was thunderstruck, by sacrificing a sheep which
being called bidens , the thing affected by thunder came to be termed bidental ."

OF
DIVINATION
BY
LOTS
.
Of lots there were four sorts, namely, political, military, lusorious, and
divinatory : the three first do not at all concern my present purpose , how ever treated of by some, in this place. Of the prophetical, there were
divers sorts, two of which were most in use, namely , Irixonartsic and Κληρομαντεία .. Prixopartsíce was a sort of divination by verses, wherein it was usual to take fatidical verses, and having wrote them upon little pieces of paper, to put them into a vessel, and so draw them out, expecting to read their fate

in the first draught. This was often practised upon the Sibylline oracles,
which were dispersed up and down in Greece, Italy, and all the Roman
empire : whence there is frequent mention in authors of the Sortes Sibyl line . Sometimes they took a poet, and opening in one, or more places,
accepted the first verse they met with for a prediction. This was also
called 'Paywoonartzia, from the rhapsodies of Homer ; and as some are of opinion , proceeded at the first from the esteem which poets had amongst the ancients, by whom they were reputed divine and inspired persons. But, as Homer had of all the poets the greatest name, so also the Sortes
Homericæ of all others were in the most credit; yet Euripides, and other poets, were not wholly neglected. Virgil also, and the Latin poets, were
made use of in this way, as appears as well from other instances, as that
remarkable one of Severus in Lampridius, whose promotion to the Roman
empire was foretold by opening at this verse : Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento. Remember, Roman, with imperial sway

Kangopartsíc was a sort of divination , wherein they made conjectures
by throwing tous xaneous, lots : where you may observe, that lots were
called in the plural number xañeos, and by the Latins, sortes ; to distinguish them from xañeos, and sors, which, in the singular number, usually signi fied the hint, or occasion given to diviners, to make their conjectures by, as the scholiast upon Euripides reports. These xañpos were usually black and white beans; amongst the ancients little clods of earth ; pebbles also, dice, or such like things, distinguished by certain characters : hence this divination was termed by several names, as ψηφομαντεία, αστραγαλομαν
tría , xubouaytsia , Tiogopaytsíc , &c. They cast the lots into a vessel, and having made supplication to the gods to direct them , drew them out, and, according to the characters, conjectured what should happen to them . All
lots were sacred to Mercury, whom they thought to preside over this divination ; and therefore the ancients, as Eustathius observes,3 svsguia; Svexa, for good luck's sake, and that Mercury might be propitious to them , used , with the rest of their lots, to put in one, which they called ' Equsu
xãñgov, Mercury's lot, which was an olive leaf, and was drawn out before the rest.
Sometimes
the
lots
were
not
cast
into
vessels
,
but
upon
tables
consecrated
for
that
purpose
.

and
they

God
.
This
divination
,
as
it
is
described
by
St
Cyril
of
Alexandria
and
Theophylact
,
2
was
thus
performed
:
having
erected
two
sticks
,
they
mur
mured
forth
a
certain
charm
,
and
then
,
according
as
the
sticks
fell
back
wards
or
forwards
,
towards
the
right
or
left
,
they
gave
advice
in
any
affair
.
Not
much
different
was
Binopartsíc
,
in
which
divination
was
made
by
arrows
,
shaken
together
in
a
quiver
.
Others
are
of
opinion
,
that
the
arrows
were
cast
into
the
air
,
and
the
man
was
to
steer
his
course
the
same
way
that
the
arrow
inclined
in
its
descent
.
This
seems
to
be
the
divination
used
by
Nebuchadnezzar
in
Ezekiel
,
where
he
deliberates
about
invading
the
Israelites
and
the
Ammonites
;
the
words
are
these
,
as
they
are
rendered
by
our
translators
:

Appoint

way
,
that
the
sword
may
come
to
Rabbath
of
the
Ammonites
,
and
to
Judah

Jerusalem

defenced
.
For
the
king
of
Babylon
stood
at
the
parting
of
the
way
,
at
the
head
of
the
two
ways
,
to
use
divination
;
he
made
his
arrows
bright
(
the
septua
gint
translation
speaks
not
of
Béros
,
but
púbdos
)
,
he
consulted
with
images
,
he
looked
in
the
liver
.
At
his
right
hand
was
the
divination
for
Jerusalem
,
to
appoint
captains
,
to
open
the
mouth
in
the
slaughter
,
to
lift
up
the
voice
with
shouting
,
to
appoint
battering

rams
against
the
gates
,
to
cast
a
mount
,
and
to
build
a
fort
.
But
because
the
prophet
speaks
of
making
his
arrows
bright
,
some
are
of
opinion
that
he
divined
by
looking
upon
the
iron
heads
of
the
arrows
,
and
observing
the
various
appearances
in
them
;
in
the
same
manner
as
some
in
our
days
pretend
to
tell
fortunes
by
looking
upon
their
nails
,
says
Clarius
upon
that
place
.
Another
method
of
divination
by
rods
was
used
by
the
Scythians
,
and
is
described
in
Herodotus
.
From
the
Scythians
,
it
was
derived
,
with
some
alteration
,
to
the
Germans
,
and
is
described
by
Tacitus
.

you
may
also

but
these
,
and
some
others
,
I
shall
pass
by
,
as
not
pertinent
to
my
present
design
.
Another way of divination by lots was used in Greece and Rome, in this manner : the person that was desirous to learn his fortune carried with

him a certain number of lots, distinguished by several characters or in scriptions, and walking to and fro in the public ways, desired the first boy that met him to draw ; and if that which came forth agreed with what he
had conceived in his mind, it was taken for an infallible prophecy. This
divination is, by Plutarch, in his treatise about Isis and Osiris, said to be derived from the Egyptians, by whom the actions and words of boys were carefully observed , as containing in them something divine and propheti cal; and for that reason no less absurd than the practice itself, all the grounds they had for it being only this, namely, that Isis having wandered
up and down, in a fruitless search after Osiris, happened at last upon a company of boys at play, and was by them informed about what she had
so long sought for in vain. To this custom of divining by boys, as some think, Tibullus alludes, when he says,' Tla sacras pueri sortes ter sustulit, illi
And
thrice
the
boy
a
happy
omen
drew
.
But
I
am
rather
of
opinion
,
that
the
poet
speaks
of
a
different
kind
of
lots
,
which
was
this
:
in
the
market
,
highways,
and
other
places
of
concourse
,
it
was
usual
for
a
boy
,
or
a
man
,
whom
the
Greeks
called
'
Ayúgans
,
to
stand
with
a
little
tablet,
called
in
Greek
nivač
eyuprixòs,
or
kuptix
oavis
,
upon
which
were
written
certain
fatidical
verses
,
which
,
according
as
the
dice
light
upon
them
,
told
the
consultants
what
fortune
they
were
to
expect
.
Sometimes
,
instead
of
tablets
,
they
had
pots
or
urns
,
into
which
the
lots
or
fatidical
verses
were
thrown
,
and
thence
drawn
by
the
boys
;
and
I
am
the
rather
inclined
to
think
the
poet's

,
which
foretold
things
to
come,
not
by
certain
accidents
,
and
casual
occurrences,
that
were
thought
to
contain
in
them
presages
of
good
or
evil
.
Of
these
there
were
three
sorts
:
the
first,
of
things
internal
,
by
which
I
mean
those
that
affected
the
persons
themselves
.
The
second
,
of
things
external
,
that
only
appeared
to
men
,
but
did
not
make
any
im
pression
upon
them
.
The
third
were
ominous
words
.
Of
these
in
their
order
. First
,
of
those
omens
that
men
received
from
themselves
,
which
are
distinguished
into
four
kinds
:
First,
marks
upon
the
body
,
as
izaic
,
spots
like
oil
.
Secondly
,
sudden
perturbations
seizing
upon
the
mind
;
such
were
the
panici
terrores
,
'
panic
fears
,'
which
were
sudden
consternations
that
seized
upon
men
,
without
any
visible
cause
,
and
therefore
were
im
puted
to
the
operation
of
demons
,
especially
of
Pan
,
upon
men's
fancies,
Of
these
there
is
frequent
mention
in
history
;
as
when
Brennus,
the
Gal
lic
general,
had
been
defeated
by
the
Greeks
;
the
night
following,
he
and
the
remainder
of
his
troops
were
seized
with
such
terrors
and
distractions,
that
,
ignorant
of
what
they
were
doing
,
they
fell
to
wounding
and
killing
one
another,
till
they
were
all
utterly
destroyed
.
Such
another
fright
gave
the
Athenians
a
great
advantage
against
the
Persians
,
insomuch
that
Pan
had
a
statue
erected
for
that
piece
of
service
;
as
appears
from
one
of
Simonides
'
epigrams:
Τον

Πάνα
,
τον
Αρκάδα

This
bust
to

,
Arcadian
Pan
,
was
placed

powerful
Medes
.
These
terrors
were
attributed
to
Pan
,
because
when
Osiris
was
bound
by
Typho,
Pan
and
the
satyrs
appearing
,
cast
him
into
a
fright;
or
,
be
cause
he
affrighted
the
giants
that
waged
war
against
Jupiter
.
There
is
also
a
third
reason
assigned
by
mythologists,
which
will
be
explained
in
the
following
book
,
In
these
terrors,
whereof
there
was
either
no
appa
rent
cause
,
or
at
least
none
answerable
to
the
greatness
of
the
sudden
con
sternation
,
it
was
a
good
remedy
to
do
something
quite
contrary
to
what
the
danger
would
have
required
,
had
it
been
such
as
men
vainly
imagined
.
Thus
Alexander
caused
his
soldiers
to
disarm
themselves,
when
they
were
on
a
sudden
in
a
great
fear
of
they
knew
not
what
.
All
sudden
and
extraordinary
emotions
and
perturbations,
in
body
or
mind
,
were
looked
upon
as
evil
omens
;
such
was
that
of
Penelope's
cour
tiers
described
by
Homer
,
and
said
to
have
been
caused
by
Minerva
,
their
implacable
enemy.

omens

gathered from the palpitations of each of them ; whom you may consult at leisure. Melampus, the famous fortune-teller, dedicated a book upon this subject to Ptolemy Philadelphus; another to the same purpose was com posed by Posidonius : the title of which was Παλμικών oιώνισμα. The fourth sort of internal omens were the IIraquo, or sneezings, which were so superstitiously observed, that divine worship was thought due to
them : though some say this adoration was only an expiation of the omen ; others are of opinion , that sneezing was a disease, or at least a symptom of some infirmity ; and therefore, when any man sneezed , it was usual to say, Zñés, may you live or Zī rãdov, God bless you . "To this custom
Ammian alludes, in an epigram upon one who had a long nose , which, he says, was at so great a distance from his ears, that he could not hear him self sneeze :
Ουδέ λίγει , Ζεϋ σώσον, όταν πταρε , ου γαρ ακούει His long -beak'd snout at such a distance lies Της ρινός , πολύ γαρ της ακοής απέχει.
From
his
dull
ears
,
that
he
ne'er
hears
it
sneeze
;
And
therefore
never
does
he
say
,
God
Lless
.
Where
you
may
observe
,
that
it
was
not
only
usual
for
persons
that
stood
by
to
cry
Ziū
o
woor
,
but
also
for
men
when
themselves
sneezed
.
However
it
be
,
it
is
certain
that
sneezing
was
accounted
sacred
,
as
appears
from
Athenæus
,?
who
proves
that
the
head
was
esteemed
holy
,
because
it
was
customary
to
swear
by
and
adore
as
holy
the
sneezes
that
proceeded
from
it
;
and
Aristotle
tells
us
in
express
terms
,
that
sneezing
was
accounted
a
deity
,
Τον
Πσαρμόν
θεόν
ηγούμεθα
.
Casaubon
also
has
proved
the
same
out
of
Xenophon
,
who
reports
,
that
the
soldiers
with
one
accord
worshipped
it
as
a
god
.
But
it
is
scarce
to
be
supposed
they
could
be
so
ignorant
as
to
think
every
act
of
sneezing
a
deity
;
nor
do
Aristotle's
words
necessarily
imply
they
did
;
for
no
more
need
be
understood
by
them
,
than
that
there
was
a
god
of
sneezing
,
called
Iragueòs
and
Xeno
phon
may
be
expounded
the
same
way
;
namely
,
that
when
the
soldiers
heard
a
sneeze
,
they
worshipped
the
god
,
i
.
e
.
the
god
of
sneezing
;
or
it
may
be
,
no
more
is
meant
than
that
they
worshipped
God
,
perhaps
in
the
usual
form
of
Ziū
owo
ovo
or
by
casting
up
some
other
short
ejaculation
to
any
of
the
gods
to
avert
the
omen
.
However,
it
is
certain
that
great
regard
was
given
to
sneezing,
inso
much
,
that
if
a
man
sneezed
at
certain
times
,
or
on
any
certain
side
,
it
was
enough
to
persuade
them
to
,
or
discourage
them
from
,
any
business
of
the
greatest
moment
.
When
Themistocles
was
offering
sacrifice
,
it
happened
that
three
beautiful
captives
were
brought
to
him
,
and
at
the
same
time
the
fire
burned
clear
and
bright,
and
a
sneeze
happened
on
the
right
hand
;
whereupon
Euphrantides
,
the
soothsayer
,
embracing
him
,
predicted
the
memorable
victory
which
was
afterwards
obtained
by
him.5
Such
a
sneeze
,
happening
whilst
Xenophon
was
making
a
speech
,
was
thought
a
sufficient
reason
to
constitute
him
general.

self, though a great despiser of heathen superstitions, judged it not unrea sonable to make a sneeze serve as an admonition from the demon which
always tended him. And that the observation of sneezing was very ancient, appears from the virgins in Theocritus, 1 who thus congratulate Menelaus upon his marriage with Helena : *Ολβιε γέμβρ', αγαθός τις επιπταρεν έρχομένω σοι To bless her bed, from all the princely crowd 'Ες Σπάρταν. Fair Helen chose you - Cupid sneez'd aloud. FAWKES .
There is also mention of this custom in Homer, who has introduced Penelope rejoicing at a sneeze of her son Telemachus.2 Sneezing was not always a lucky omen, but varied according to the
alteration of circumstances : των πταρμών οι μεν είσιν ωφέλιμοι, οι δε βλαβε poí- some sneezes are profitable, others prejudicial, according to the scho
liast upon the following passage of Theocritus, where he makes the
sneezing of the Cupids to have been an unfortunate omen to a certain lover : 3
Σιμιχίδα μεν έρωτες επέκταρον.
When Xenophon was persuading his soldiers to encounter the enemy, a sneeze was accounted so dangerous an omen, that they were forced to appoint public prayers to expiate it. If any person Sneezed , από μίσων
YUXTūv åxpe préons inégas, between midnight and the following noontide, it
Was fortunate : but από μίσης ημέρας άχρι μέσων νυκτών, from noontide till midnight, it was unfortunate ; the reasonsof which difference Aristotle has
endeavoured to account for . If a man sneezed at the table while they
were taking away, or if another happened to sneeze upon his left hand, it was unlucky; if on the right hand , fortunate. If in the undertaking any business, two, or four sneezes happened, it was a lucky omen, and gave encouragement to proceed ; if more than four, the omen was neither good
nor bad ; if one, or three, it was unlucky, and dissuaded them from pro
ceeding in what they had designed. If two men were deliberating about any business, and both of them chanced to sneeze together, it was a pros perous omen,
I come, in the next place, to speak something concerning the omens which appeared to men, but were not contained in their own bodies, of
which there were several sorts: as first, the beginnings of things were looked upon to contain something ominous.
A sudden and unusual splendour in any house, or other place, was a very fortunate presage ; as, on the contrary, darkness was an omen of in felicity; the former being thought to accompany the celestial gods, whereas
darkness intimated the presence of some of the infernal deities, which was thought to be commonly pernicious. Thus Telemachus, in Homer,
describes a prodigy appearing before the victory which Ulysses obtained against the courtiers of his wife Penelope :?

It was thought a direful presage, when any thing unusual befell the temples, altars, or statues of their gods. Such a one was that which
Pausanias relates concerning the brazen statue of Diana, ' which queñas Thy dorida, let the shield fall out of her hand. Before the Lacedæmoniaus
were vanquished at Leuctra, the two golden stars consecrated by them at Delphi to Castor and Pollux, fell down, and could never be found again .” Hither must also be reduced the sweating, or falling down, of images, the
doors of temples opening of themselves, and other accidents, whereof no account could be assigned .
To this place likewise belong all monstrous and frightful births, sudden and unusual deluges, the unexpected withering and decaying, or flourish ing, of trees or fruits, the noise of beasts, or any thing happening to men
or other creatures, contrary to the common course of nature ; the inversion
of which was thought a certain argument of the divine displeasure.3 Hither also are to be referred ' Eyódese obubonce, omens offering them
selves in the way, of which Polis and Hippocrates (not the physician) are said to have written books.
Such were, the meeting of a eunuch, a black, an ape, a bitch with whelps, a vixen with cubs, a snake lying so in the way as to part the com
pany , a hare crossing the road ; a woman working at her spindle, or carry ing it uncovered, was thought to be very prejudicial to any design, and to blast whatever hopes they had conceived, especially about the fruits of the earth . A weasel crossing the way was a sufficient reason for deferring a public assembly for that day ; it was called yaañ, and Artemidorus gives the reason why its running by was so much taken notice of, viz. because
it is iróf noos dinn ; that is, the letters in each word signify the same
number, viz . 42. All these were δυσάντητα , δυσoιώνιστα , and αποτρόπαια Iscellata , unlucky and abominable sights.
Another sort of external omens were those that happened at home, and the divination that observed them was called Tò oinoo xotixòv, concerning which Xenocrates is said to have writen a treatise. Such as these were
the coming in of a black dog, a mouse eating a bag of salt, the appearing of a snake or weasel upon the house top. This sort of divining by beasts
is reported by Suidas to have been invented by Telegonus. Such also were the throwing down of salt, the spilling of water, honey, or wine,
taking the wine away while any person was drinking, a sudden silence,
and ten thousand other accidents. In putting on their clothes, the right side was served first ; and therefore, if a servant gave his master the left
shoe first, it was no small fault. This omen was particularly observed by
1
Messeniacis
.
2 Cicero de Divinat. i. 3 Georgic. i. 460.



OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE. 321
Augustus Cæsar, as we are told by Suetonius ;' and Pliny reports,2 that on a certain day, wherein that emperor had like to have been destroyed in a mutiny of some of his soldiers, his left shoe was put on before his right. It was a direful omen when the crown fell from any man's head . On which account it is mentioned, among other unfortunate presages, in Seneca's Thyestes. Regium capiti decus Bis terque lapsum est.
Hither also may be referred the various actions which were thought to contain good or bad fortune. For instance, at feasts, was accounted
lucky to crown the cup with a garland.3 This practice was taken from Homer's heroes, who used to drink out of
cups that were iriotipies orvoso the reason of which, says Eustathius, out of Athenæus, was this, viz, because a garland represents a circle, which is the most capacious and complete of all figures. It was usual also to carry home the fragments left at sacrifices, for good luck's sake, as hath been
observed in another place ; and these were called üzícias, as contributing
to the preservation of health ,* &c.
In the last place, I come to ominous words, which , as they were good or bad, were believed to presage accordingly. Such words were called
ότται, κληδόνες, or φημαι, από του φάναι, as the Latin omen is so called, g. oremen , quia fit ab ore ; i. e. because it proceeds from the mouth , says Festus: they may be interpreted voices, for Tully hath called them by the name of voces.5 • The Pythagoreans, ' says he, " used to observe the voices
of men as well as of the gods . Hence, as the same author there observes, the old Romans, before the beginning of any action , used this preface, quod bonum , faustum , felix, fortunatumque sit; wishing that their enter
prise might succeed well, happily, prosperously , and fortunately. In divine service , he adds, that proclamation was made, ut faverent linguis,
that all there present " might govern their tongues .' In bidding to festivals and holidays, the people were commanded, litibus et jurgiis abstinere, “ to beware of brawls and quarrels . At public lustrations, the persons who
brought the victims were required to have bona nomina , “ fortunate names.'
The same, he there tells us, was also observed by the consuls in the choice of the first soldier. This sort of divination was most in use at Smyrna,
where they had xandów iegòv, a temple, in which answers were returned this way ; and Apollo Spodius gave oracles in Thebes after the same manner ; but the first invention of it is attributed to Ceres . Serapion
relates,' that the Delphian sibyl was endued with a power of divining after her death, and that the gross parts of her body being converted first into earth, and then changed into herbs, communicated the same faculty to the entrails of beasts which fed on them ; whence proceeded the way of divin ing by entrails ; but that the finer parts, mixing with the air, presaged

future events by these randóss, ominous voices, concerning which we are now treating.
Words that boled ill were called κακαι ότται , or δυσφημίαι " and hethat
spoke them was said βλασφημεϊν, φθέγγεσθαι βλασφημίαν, as Euripides terms it, where he speaks of certain ominous words let fall by a servant at
a feast, as one of the company was going to drink : Βλασφημίαν τις οικετών έφθέγξατο .. Unlucky words one of the servants spoke.
Plautus called it obscenare, or, as some read , obscævare : for scæva siguifies luck, either good or bad ; and the words Horace calls male omin ata verba .
Such words as these they were always careful to avoid ; insomuch that
instead of δεσμωτήριον, α prison , they put often οίκημα , α house , μέλι instead of όξος , γλυκεία instead of χολή, οχετός for βόρβορος, καλλιάς for πίθηκος, φιλατης for κλέπτης, άγος for μυσος, κοινός for δήμιος , Σεμναι θεαι or Ευμενίδες for 'Εριννύες. Which way of speaking chiety obtained at Athens. In time of divine worship , nothing was more strictly com
manded, than that they should suonyesīv, or avoid all ominous expressions: which , if spoken by a friend or near relation , they accounted so much the
Mr Dryden hath excellently expressed this custom in his Edipus, where after that hero has been thundering most dreadful imprecations
upon the murderers of Laius, Jocasta is introduced speaking thus: Jocasta . At your devotions ? Heaven succeed

Which verses I have here transcribed, because they fully represent the
ancient custom of catching ominous expressions. There are other re markable examples in Cicero.2 Some words and proper names imported success, answerable to their natural signification ; Leotychides being desired by a Samian to wage war against the Persians, inquired his name ; the Samian replied, that it was 'Hyndestpétos, the leader of an army. Then Leotychides answered ,
Hynouotpátou décoledo Tòy olovèy, I embrace the omen of Hegisistratus ;
dézsolan oiwvòv, amongst the Greeks, importing the same with arripere omon amongst the Latins, which signifies the accepting of an omen, and applying it to the business in hand : for it was thought to lie very
much in the power of the hearer whether he would receive the omen
my Laius.

or not, Ostentorum vires in eorum erant potestate quibus ostendebantur,
says Pliny : ' the force and efficacy of omens depended upon the persons to whom they appeared .' For if the omen was immediately taken by the hearer, or struck upon his imagination, it was efficacious; but if neglected , or not taken notice of, it was of no force . Hence it is observed , that Julius
Cæsar, who paid no deference to those predictions, was never deterred by them from any undertaking, whereas Augustus frequently desisted from
his designs on this account.' Virgil introduces Æneas catching Ascanius' words from his mouth ; for the Harpies, and Anchises also, having fore told that the Trojans should be forced to gnaw their very tables for want of other provisions, Sed non ante datam cingetis mucenibus urbem

Imperious hunger urge you to devour Those very tables whence you fed before.
After this they landed in Italy ; and happening to dine upon the grass,
instead of tables, or trenchers, which their present circumstances did not afford, they laid their meat upon pieces of bread, which afterwards they ate up ; whereupon, Heus ! etiam mensas consumimus, inquit Tillus. Ascanins this observ'd, and smiling said , See, we devour the tables whence we fed .
Æneas presently caught the omen, as the poet subjoins.
The lucky sound no sooner reach'd their ears, Prima tulit finem : primamque loquentis ab ore But straight they quite dismiss'd their former caree; Eripuit pater, ac stupefactus numine pressit. Th’ auspicious words his sire in rapture took, Revolving what the oracle had spoke,
This custom of catching omens was very ancient, and derived from the
eastern countries : that it was practised by the Jews, is by some inferred from the story of Jonathan the son of king Saul, who going to encounter a Philistine garrison , thus spoke to his armour-bearer :* • If they say unto us, Tarry until we come unto you, then we will stand still in our place,
and will not go up unto them. But if they say thus, Come up unto us, then we will go up ; for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us.'
For good luck's sake, whenever they applied themselves to any serious
business, they began with such a preface as this, Osòs, Ocòs, or Eŭ rúdos
pesy, or " Ertai pin sů, or " Eotect peir árabina túan, like to Persius' Hoc bene
sit; and that saying of the Romans, Quod bonum, felix , fortunatumque sit. And all their works and speeches were begun in the name of some
god ; whence Aratus, 'Εκ Διός αρχόμεσθαι Let us with Jove begin
which Theocritus has borrowed from him in his seventeenth eclogue, and
Virgil in his third. Xenophon gives the reason of this practice,5 viz, that
things undertaken in the name of the gods were likely to have the most prosperous events .

Certain times also were ominous; some days being accounted fortunate, and causes of success ; others unfortunate, and causes of the miscarriage
of things undertaken upon them . Some days were proper for one business, others for another, and some for none at all, as that author relates in the forementioned poem ; where he runs through all the days of the month ,
declaring the virtue and efficacy of them . Thus, to observe days was termed αισιούσθαι τας ημέρας. This practice was common in other nations, and particularly at Rome. Augustus Cæsar never went abroad
upon the day following the Nundinæ , nor began any serious undertaking on the nonæ ; and this he did on no other account, as he affirmed in one
of his letters to Tiberius, than to avoid duo onuíæv ominis, the unlucky omen which attended things begun in those days. And it was a general opinion among the Romans, that the next days after the nonæ , ides, or kalendæ, were unfortunate, as appears both from the ancient grammarians, and from Livy, Ovid, and Plutarch. The like observation of days was practised by many Christians, when they had lately been converted from
heathenism , as hath been remarked by St Ambrose, in his comment on
that passage of St Paul, where he reproves the Galatians for observing days, and months, and times, and years. The way to avert an omen was either to hrow a stone at thing, or
kill it outright, if it was an ominous animal, that so the evil portended by
it might fall upon its own head ; and if it was an unlucky speech , to retort it upon the speaker with an εις κεφαλήν σοι: Tibi in caput redeat,
it fall upon thine own head :' which perhaps is an expression borrowed
from the 'Ispornófoi, who, when they espied any thing in the victim that seemed to portend any misfortune to themselves or their country, used to pray that it might εις κεφαλήν ταύτην τρέπεσθαι, be turned upon the vie
tim's head. The like expressions are sometimes made use of in holy scripture, as in the fifteenth verse of Obadiah's prophecy, Tò évtarádové σου ανταποδοθήσεται εις κεφαλήν σοι: Or , as our English translators have rendered it, thy reward shall return upon thine own head. And again , in Kings , chap. 3, Και ανταπέδωκε Κύριος την κακιάν σου εις κεφαλήν σου, in English thus: and the Lord hath returned thy wickedness upon thine own head. Herodotus reports, that it was an Egyptian custom , from which it is probable the Grecians derived theirs.5

aversion ; whence πτύειν, to spit , is put for: καταφρονείν, εν ουδενί λογίζειν, to contemn .'
Sometimes they prayed that the ominous thing might in ultimas terras deportari, “ be carried away to the farthest part of the world ;' or in mare deferri, ' be cast into the sea . This last was done to certain monstrous births, particularly to hermaphrodites, which were accounted prodigia .? Sometimes the thing was burned with ligna infelicia, that is, such sort of
wood as was in tutela inferúm deorum , avertentiumque, sacred to the gods of hell, and those which averted evil omens, ' being chiefly thorns, and such other trees, which were fit for no other use than to be burned.
Sometimes the prodigy , when burned, was cast into the water, and parti cularly into the sea, if it was not too far distant.
Lastly, upon the meeting an unlucky omen, they often desisted from
what they were doing, and began it afresh.5
CHAP. XVIII.
OF MAGIC AND INCANTATIONS .
Besides the methods of foretelling future events already mentioned , and that divination which is commonly called physical, because it makes pre
dictions without any supernatural assistance, by the mere knowledge of physical, or natural causes, there are several others, most of which are
comprehended under the names of Μαγεία and 'Επωδαι, magic and incantations; between which though some make a nice distinction, yet they bear a near relation to each other ; and therefore I shall treat of them
conjunctly in this place. And though some of the species of these divina
tions might be invented in later ages, and never practised in old Greece, whose customs alone it is my chief design to describe, not meddling with those innovations that were introduced in later times, after the Greeks
were subjected to the Roman empire ; yet since it is very difficult to determine exactly of all, which were truly ancient, and which were truly modern ; since, also, there is frequent mention of them in writers of the middle ages , especially those that lived towards the declination of the
Roman greatness, I shall beg the reader's leave to give a brief account of the most remarkable of them : for to enumerate all would be an endless,
as well as an unreasonable undertaking ; and a great many of them, such as those wherein the Incubi and Succubi were concerned , contain in them
too much of profaneness and horror to be endured by any civilized ear . Magical arts are said by the Grecians to have been invented in Persia , where, at the first, they were had in great honour and reputation ; for the

First, then , Neugojartsia was a divination in which answers were given by deceased persons. It was sometimes performed by the magical use of
a bone, or vein of a dead body, especially by the Thessalians; or by pour ing warm blood into a carcass, as it were to renew life in it, as Erichtho doth in Lucan ;' or by some other enchantments to restore dead men to life.
Sometimes they used to raise the ghosts of deceased persons, by various invocations and ceremonies. Ulysses, in the ninth book of Homer's Odysseis, having sacrificed black sheep in a ditch, and poured forth cer tain libations, invites the ghosts, particularly that of Tiresias, to drink of
the blood , after which they become willing to answer his questions. The same is done by Tiresias in Statius, by Æson in Valerius Flaccus, by Nero in Pliny. Gregory Nazianzen speaks also of tūv kratejevojévw
παρθένων τε και παιδιών επί ψυχαγωγία , υirgins and boys slaughtered αε the evocation of ghosts. The most usual ceremonies used on these occa
sions are thus described by Seneca, who has introduced Tiresias consulting the ghosts in a dark and gloomy grove :2
Hinc ut sacerdos intulit senior gradum , Vocat inde manes, teque qui manez regis, Haud est moratus : præstitit noctem locus, Et obsidentem claustra lethalis lacus : Tuncfossa tellus, et super rapti rogis Curmenque magicum volvit, et rapido miner Jaciuntur ignes.

formed in any place ; but some places were appropriated to this use , and called Nexvopartsír, several of which are mentioned by the antient poets, but two of them were most remarkable ; the first in Thesprotia, where Orpheus is said to have restored to life his wife Eurydice, and Periander,
the tyrant of Corinth , was affrighted by the apparition of his wife Melissa, whom he had murdered ; the other in Campania, at the lake Avernus,
celebrated by Homer and Virgil, in their stories of Ulysses and Æneas.
'Tàgonavtiíc, or divination by water, sometimes called Ingouarasi , when it was done by fountain water : in this they observed the various impressions, changes, fruxes, refluxes, swellings, diminutions, colours,
images, &c. in the water. Sometimes they dipped a looking-glass into the water, when they desired to know what would become of a sick person ; for as he looked well or ill in the glass, accordingly they presumed of his future condition. Sometimes they filled a bowl with water, and let down into it a ring, equally poised on each side, and hanging hy a thread tied to one of their fingers ; then , in a form of prayer, requested of the gods to declare or confirm the question in dispute ; whereupon, if the thing pro
posed was true, the ring, of its own accord, would strike against the side of the bowl a set number of times . Sometimes they threw three stones into the water, and observed the turns they made in sinking. Instead of water, sometimes they made use of oil and wine, and then the liquor was called xútha and instead of stones, they sometimes used wedges of gold or silver. This divination was sometimes performed in a basin , and thence called
Asxe vopartiía • which also was sometimes practised in a different man
ner, thus: they distinguished the stones, or wedges, with certain charac ters, and then , having invoked the demon in a set form , proposed the
question they had a mind to be satisfied about, to which an answer was returned in a small voice, not unlike a hiss, proceeding out of the water. The scholiast upon Lycophron is of opinion , that this method of divination
was as ancient as the Trojan war, and practised by Ulysses ; which he thinks gave occasion for all the poetical fictions of his descent into the
infernal regions to consult Tiresias' ghost. Sometimes divination by 'water was performed with a looking - glass, and called
Katottgouartsid . Sometimes also glasses were used, and the images of what should happen represented without water. Sometimes it was per formed in a vessel of water, the middle part of which was called gáoten, and then the divination was termed
Teorgopaytéír , the manner of which was thus: they filled certain round
glasses with fair water, about which they placed lighted torches : then
invoked a demon, praying in a low murmuring voice, and proposed the question to be solved . A chaste and unpolluted boy, or a woman big with child, was appointed to observe with the greatest care and exactness all the
alterations in the glasses: at the same time desiring, besecching, and also 1 Herodotus Terpsichore. 2 Cassandra, ver, 813, pàg . 84, Edit, nostræ. 222

.
commanding an answer, which at length the demon used to return by
images in the glasses, which by reflection from the water represented what should come to pass.
Kquoteddouceytsia was performed by polished and enchanted crystals, in which future events were signified by certain marks and figures. Aartvàojeartsíc was a divination by rings, enchanted, or made accord ing to some position of the celestial bodies. Gyges, the king of Lydia, had a ring of this sort, which when he turned to the palm of his hand, he
became invisible to others, but could see every body ; and by the help of this he enjoyed his mistress the queen, and slew his master Candaules, whom he afterwards succeeded, Some ascribe the invention of this divi
nation to Helena, the wife of Menelaus, who in Photius' Bibliotheca is said to have found out τον διά δακτύλων κλήρον, the lots which consisted of rings, and with these to have conquered Alexander. But this is rather
to be understood concerning the game of lots, than any sort of divination, 'Onu xoleseytsia was performed by the nails of an unpolluted boy, covered with oil and soot, which they turned to the sun, the reflection of whose rays was believed to represent, by certain images, the things they had a mind to be satisfied about.
'Asgouartsía, foretold future events from certain spectres, or other appearances in the air; and sometimes thus: They folded their heads in a
napkin , and having placed a bowl full of water in the open air, proposed their question in a small whispering voice ; at which time, if the water boiled or fermented , they thought what they had spoken was approved of and confirmed .
Addopartsíce was sometimes performed by a precious stone called siderites, which they washed in spring water in the night by candle-light : the per son that consulted it was to be purified from all manner of pollution, and to have his face covered : this done, he repeated divers prayers, and placed
certain characters in an appointed order ; and then the stone moved itself,
and in a soft gentle murmur , or, as some say , in a voice like that of a child , returned an answer . By a stone of this nature, Helenus is reported to have foretold the destruction of Troy. Theocritus 1 has given us an account of two sorts of divination practised by a country swain, to try what share he had in his mistress' affections.
Where the shepherd complains he had found his suit was rejected these two ways : first, by the herb telephilum , which, being crushed in his hand ,
or upon his arm , returned no sound ; for it was usual to strike that, or some other herb, against their arms, and if they crackled in breaking, good ; if not, it was an unlucky omen.

This they called Koorivoparttía ; it was generally practised to discover thieves, or others suspected of any crime, in this manner : they tied a
thread to the sieve, by which it was upheld, or else placed a pair of sheers , which they held up by two fingers; then prayed to the gods to direct and assist them ; after that, they repeated the names of the persons under sus
picion, and he at whose name the sieve whirled round, or moved, was thought to have committed the fact. Another sort of divination was com monly practised upon the same account, which was called
'Ažuvopartsía, from ' Ağion, an axe, or hatchet, which they fixed so exactly upon a round stake, that neither end might outpoise or weigh down
the other : then they prayed, and repeated the names of those they sus pected ; and the person at whose name the hatchet made any the least motion, was found guilty. Kepanovofloc vtsic was by the head of an ass, as the name imports, which they broiled on coals ; and after having muttered a few prayers, they
repeated the persons' names as before ; or the crime, in case one was only suspected ; at which, if the jaws made any motion, and the teeth chattered against one another, they thought the villain sufficiently discovered .
'Arizaguopcevtsíce was a very mysterious divination , in which they made use of a cock in discovering secret and unknown transactions, or future events. It was effected after this manner : having wrote in the dust the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, and laid a grain of wheat or barley
upon every one of them , a cock, magically prepared , was let loose amongst
them , and those letters, out of which he picked the corns, being joined together, were thought to declare whatever they were desirous to be cer tified of. This divination the famous magician Jamblichus, Proclus' master, is said to have made use of, with a design to find out the person who was to succeed Valens Cæsar in the empire ; but the cock picking up
only four of the grains, namely, those that lay upon the letters I, 4, 6, d, left uncertain, whether Theodosius, Theodotus, Theodorus, or Theodectes, was the person designed by the fates to be emperor. However, Valens
being informed of the matter, was enraged at it, and put to death several per
sons, for no other reason than that their names began with those letters ;
and made a diligent search after the magicians themselves; whereupon Jamblichus, to prevent the emperor's cruelty, ended his life by a draught of poison.
Endngopartsíu was performed by red-hot iron , upon which they laid an odd number of straws, and observed what figures, bendings, sparklings, &c., they made in burning.
Monußdopartsíc was by observing the motions, figures, &c. of melted lead . The three following methods of divination are by some reckoned amongst the various sorts of incantations.
Timeopartiíd , or divination by ashes ; which was performed in this
manner: they wrote the things they had a mind to be resolved about, in ashesupon a plank, or any such thing : this they exposed to the open air,

where it was to continue for some time , and those letters that remained
whole and nowise defaced by the winds, or other accidents, were thought to contain in them a solution of the question ,
Botavolaytsia , or divination by herbs, especially lasaíopaxos, or salvia ;
or by fig -leaves, and thence called Sunopavrsid , was practised thus: the persons that consulted, wrote their own names, and their questions, upon leaves, which they exposed to the wind : and as many of the letters as
remained in their own places, were taken up, and being joined together, : contained an answer to the question . Knpolicytsia, or divination by wax, which they melted over a vessel of
water, letting it drop within three definite spaces, and observed the figure, situation, distance, and concretion , of the drops. Besides these, there
were infinite other sorts of divination : as Χειρομαντεία , Φυσιογνωμία , which
was practised in Socrates' time, 'Ονοματoμαντία , 'Αριθμομαντεία , Γεωμαν Tsia, Aux roparttid , mentioned with several others, by Aratus in his
Prognostics, and Pliny in his Natural History ; but these I shall pass by, and only trouble you with one more, which is so remarkable, that it must not be omitted, namely ,
paguarsíæ , which was usually performed by certain medicated and en chanted compositions of herbs , minerals, &c., which they called páguards By these, strange and wonderful things were effected ; some of them tacen inwardly, caused blindness, madness, love, & c ., such were the medicaments
by which Circe transformed Ulysses' soldiers. Others infected by a touch ; such was the garment which Medea sent to Creusa. Others spread their venom far off, and operated upon persons at a great distance . There were also pequeaxa owongue , which were amulets against the former; such were the herb moly, which preserved Ulysses from Circe's enchantments ; the
laurel, the sallow -tree, the rhamn, or Christ-thorn , fleabane, the jasper stone , and innumerable others mentioned by Albertus Magnus, and Or
pheus in his book De Lapillis ; likewise certain rings, which Aristophanes, in his Plutus, calls dextuaious paguaxiras. For this art the Thessalians
were most famous of all the Greeks: Democritus and Pythagoras are also said to have been skilled in it. Every story is full of the prodigious
operations wrought by it, some of which I shall give you from the enchan tress ' own mouth in Ovid :1

Where you may observe the last verse, wherein she boasts that she was able to draw the moon from her orb ; for the ancients really believed, that
incantations had power to charm the moon from heaven ;' and whenever
the moon was eclipsed they thought it was done by the power of magic ; for which reason it was usual to beat drums and kettles, to sound trumpets
and hautboys, to drown, if it was possible, the voices of the magicians, that their charms might not reach her. The moon also was thought to
preside over this art, and therefore was invoked, together with Hecate, to
whom the invention of it was ascribed ; whence Medea, in Euripides said,
that of all the gods, she paid the greatest veneration to Hecate . ” Some of the rites used at the invocation of this goddess are given us by
Apollonius.3
To this sort of divination are to be referred charms and amulets against poison, venom, and diseases. Suidas reports, that the curing of distem
pers by sacrifices, and the repetition of certain words, was practised ever since the time of Minos king of Crete ; and Homer relates 4 how Autoly cus' sons stanched Ulysses' blood, flowing from a wound he received in hunting a wild boar, hy a charm .
The same is observed by Pliny ," who adds, farther, that sic Theophras tus ischidiacos sanari, Cato prodidit luxatis membris carmen auxiliari, Marcus Varro podlagris : ' it was reported by Theophrastus, that the hip gout was cured in the same manner ; by Cato, that a charm would relieve any member out of joint; and by Marcus Varro, that it would cure the gout in the feet. Chiron is said to have used the same remedy in some
distempers, but not in all. And it is probable that the use of these incantations gave rise to the fable in which Orpheus is said to have
recovered his wife Eurydice from the dead, by the force of his music ; for we are told , that Orpheus was skilled in the art of music ; and 8 that he published a book concerning the remedies of distempers. To this head are also to be reduced enchanted girdles, and other things
worn about men's bodies, to excite love, or any other passion, in those with whom they conversed : such was the Knotòs in Homer's Iliad, given by Venus to Juno, for the allurement of Jupiter to her love, as Eustathius observes, upon the aforementioned verses in the Odysseis.

Lastly, to this place also belongs Bæoravice, fascination , so called, as
grammarians inform us, hapà rò pásos xaives, from killing with the eyes , whence also the Latin word fascinus is said to have been derived. For it was believed that some malignant influence , darted from the eyes of envious and angry persons, infected the ambient air, and by that means penetrated and corrupted the bodies of animals and other things."

younger animals, as being most tender, were thought most easily to receive this sort of impressions."
Plutarch mentions certain men, whose eyes were destructive to infants
and children, by reason of the weak and tender constitution of their bodies, but had not so much power over men, whose bodies were confirmed and compacted by age. Yet he adds in the same place, that the Thebans about Pontus could not only destroy infants, but men of ripe age. Pliny
affirms the same concerning the Triballi and Illyrians, whose eyes had commonly two pupillæ, which were thought extremely conducive to fascination ; whence the same author observes farther from Cicero, fæminas omnes ubique nocere, quæ duplices pupillas habent, ' that in all places, all the women who had double eyeballs had power to hurt others on whom they would fix their eyes.' These influences were thought
chiefly to proceed from those whose spirits were moved by the passions of anger and envy. Hence the forementioned Triballi and Illyrians are
reported to have injured those whom they looked upon iratis oculis, ' with angry eyes .” And such men as were blessed with any singular and uncommon happiness were chiefly liable to fascination ; hence the follow
ing saying of Horace concerning his country seat: S

.
For the same reason , they who had been extravagantly commended by others, and more especially by themselves, were in danger of having their prosperity blasted. And the goddess Nemesis was thought to have some concern in this matter.6 Pliny speaks of whole families in Africa, quarum laudatione intereant probata, arescant arbores , emoriantur in fantes ; ' whose praises were destructive to things which they commended ,
dried up trees and killed infants. Hence , when the Romans praised any thing or person, they used to add præfiscini or præfiscinè dixerim , to avert any fascination which might ensue ; or to intimate that their commenda
tions were sincerely spoken, and not with any malicious design to preju dice what they commended. Plautus represents the same custom at Athens: Præfiscini hoc nunc dirrrim : nemo etiam me accus vit Merito meo : neque me Athenis est alter hodie quisquam ,

OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE . 333
Sometimes the figure of a man's privities was hung about the necks of children ,l which was also thought a very powerful amulet against fascina
tions, and for that reason was called fascinum . These or the like repre sentations were thought to avert the eyes of malicious persons, dià Thy
útoríay rñs öftes, by the oddness of the sight, from fixing too steadfastly on the person or thing to which they were affixed . Hence they were
sometimes hung upon the doors of houses and gardens ; and * smiths commonly placed them before their forges. Their name was borrévia ;
they are called by Plutarch 5 tpooßernávse ; in the old glossary, a goobao ráva answers to the Latin word mutinum . But we are informed by Phavorinus, that βασκάνιον λέγουσιν οι αρχαίοι" the ancients used the word βασκάνιον , the moderns προσβασκάνιον. It may farther be observed , that these figures were images of Priapus, who was believed to punish such persons as did βασκαίνειν τι των καλών, prejudice good things by fascina tion . The Romans had several other deities who averted fascinations.
The god Fascinus is mentioned as one of these ;' and Cunina is said by
Lactantius , to be worshipped, because she did infantes in cunis tueri, et fascinum submovere, 'protect children in their cradles, and avert fascina tions.' It was before observed, that some omens were averted by spitting at them , which is an action of detestation and abhorrence. Hence some,
chiefly old women , averted fascinations by spitting into their bosoms. Hence the following verse of Callimachus, which is cited by the scholiast upon Theocritus, who farther affirms that the same custom was practised in his time:
Δαίμον, τοι κόλτοισιν επιπτύουσι γυναίκες . It may be farther observed, that this was done thrice, three being a sacred
number, as has been elsewhere shown. Hence Damoetas, who is intro
duced by Theocritus representing the behaviour of Polyphemus, having praised himself, adds, that by the advice of old Cotyttaris he had thrice spit into his bosom , to prevent fascination :9 " Ως μη βασκανθώ δε τρίς εις εμόν έπτυσα κόλπον" I three times dropt my spittle on my breast;
Ταύτα γάρ α γραία με Κοτίτταρις εξεδίδαξεν.
And lest enchantment should my limbs infest Who harvest-homeatHypocoon's sung .---FAWKES
Hence it was usual to reprove arrogant persons, when they assumed more
than their due, bidding them sis xóaTous TTúlv, spit into their bosoms.10 Another method of averting fascinations from infants was this : they tied a thread of divers colours about the neck of the infant, then spit upon the ground, and taking up the spittle, mixed with dirt, upon their finger, put
upou the infant's forehead and lips.11

CHAP. XIX.
OF THE GRECIAN FESTIVALS IN GENERAL .
1 FESTIVALS were instituted upon four accounts: first, in honour of the gods, to whom , besides the worship every day paid them, some more
solemn times were set apart ; especially if they had conferred any signal favour upon the public, or upon private persons; had assisted them in defending their country ; had given them victory over their enemies ; had
delivered them out of any apparent danger, or blessed them with success in any undertaking ; it was thought but reasonable to set apart some time
for offering sacrifices and praises to them, as grateful acknowledgments for the benefits received at their hands.
Secondly, in order to procure some special favour of the gods; for, as you may learn from the following chapters, several of the festivals were instituted with a design to render the gods propitious, and willing to grant some particular blessings, as health, children, and such like. And
in times of famine, pestilence, or other public calamities, the oracles usually advised their consultants to institute solemn festivals, as the best method to appease the angry gods, and obtain of them deliverance from
the evils they laboured under ,
1 The Greeks had scarcely will easily perceive how many from severalexamples,especially any public festivals that were not things musthave combined to in- from that of the temple of Del religious. They were celebrated crease these expenses. They phi, that treasures were there

Thirdly, in memory of deceased friends, of those that had done any remarkable service for their country, or died valiantly in the defence of it. This was no small encouragement to men of generous and noble disposi
tions to enter upon honourable designs, when they saw that the brave actions of the virtuous did not perish with them , but their memories were ever held sacred by succeeding generations.
Fourthly, festivals were instituted as times of ease and rest to labourers ; that amidst all their toil and sorrow , and as it were a recompense thereof,
some days of refreshment might be allowed them. For some one or more
of these ends, most festivals seem to have been first instituted. Amongst the ancients they had few or no festivals, besides those after
harvest or vintage ; for then they used to meet and make merry with the
fruits they had gathered , eating and drinking plentifully ; which they esteemed a sort of offering their first fruits to the gods, whom they thought
honoured by so doing ; and therefore feasts were called odives, q. Jeoves, ότι δια τους θεούς οινούσθαι δεϊν υπελάμβανον, because they thought they were
obliged, in duty to the gods, to be drunk. And Seleucus tells us, that the words θαλία , and μέθη, were derived from the same original, Τόν τε οίνον
επί πλειον και την άλλην ηδυπάθειαν θεών ένεκα προσφέρεσθαι, διό και θρίνας και βαλίας και μίας ώνομασθήναι, banquets were called 9oίναι, θαλίαι, and pében, from Ocòs, or God; because it wus usual at those times to consume great quantities of wine, and other provisions, in honour of the gods. In latter ages, when the gods were increased almost to the number of men, and the old frugal way of living was laid aside, the number of festi
vals was enlarged , and the manner of them quite altered : for, whereas formerly the solemnities consisted in little or nothing besides offering a sacrifice to the gods, and after that making merry themselves ; now a great many games, processions, and innumerable ceremonies, in imitation
of the fabulous actions of the gods, were introduced and practised, to the vast charge of the public.
enians, as they exceeded all other people in the number of
their gods, so they outdid them in the number of their festivals ; which ? were twice as many as any other city observed : nor did the number and
frequency of them abate any thing of the solemnity, splendour, and charges, at their observation . ' The shops, and courts of judicature, were shut up on most of those days; the labourers rested from their works, the
tradesmen from their employments, the mourners intermitted their sor rows; and nothing but ease and pleasure, mirth and jollity , were to be found amongst them. Indeed, κοινον τούτο και των Ελλήνων και των βαρ Bógw ioti, this was common both to Greeks and barbarians, as we are in
formed by Strabo , to celebrate their religious solemnities with mirth and remission of their labours.
Most of them were celebrated at the public charge ; and lest their treasury should be exhausted by so frequent evacuations, several means

336 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
were contrived to supply and replenish them . For instance, after Thra sybulus had deposed the tyrants, their estates were confiscated for this
use ; and when the state was reduced to its old democracy, if any of the citizens, through too much wealth , became formidable to the poorer sort, and objects of their envy , it was customary to compel them to contribute towards the defraying the expenses at public festivals; and so, by con
ferring upon them a great ( though charitable and dear -bought) honour, at once sweeten the imposition , if not also oblige those on whom it was imposed, and rid themselves of those fears, and jealousies which the im moderate opulency of private persons might reasonably give to a popular state .
Thus much of festivals in general: as to the particulars, I have omitted very little that is material in the tracts of Meursius and Castellanus upon
this subject ; and some things not taken notice of by either of them , and
perhaps not unworthy of observation , I have added . Yet I do not pre tend that this is a complete or entire collection of the Grecian festivals : for that would be endless, seeing almost every man of repute, and who
had done any notable service for the public, had his anniversary day, and impossible, since hundreds of them, especially those that were observed by the less considerable cities, are not so much as mentioned in any author at this day extant ; or but barely mentioned , without any account of the
persons to whom they belonged, or the ceremonies used at their celebra
tion : however, the following chapters will furnish as much as is necessary to the understanding of the ancient Greek writers.

ACHTOPEION and ArHTOPIA, mentioned by Hesychius, without any notice of the deity, in whose honour they were observed. It is not impro bable they might belong to Apollo, and be, at least the latter of them , the same with the Lacedæmonian Kægusia . This conjecture is grounded upon the words of Hesychius, who tells us, that 'Ayhrns was the name of the person consecrated to the god at the Kapusīc. and that the festival itself
was termed 'Ayntégre, which name seems to have been derived from ayun

Ayçúnız, was celebrated at Argos, in memory of one of Proetus' daughters ; being, in all probability, the same with
Aggiand, which was observed at Argos, in memory of a deceased per son . It was also celebrated at Thebes with solemn sports,
Ayçaúrsue at Athens, in honour of Agraulus, or Aglaurus, the daughter of Cecrops, and the nymph Aglauris, and priestess of Minerva, to whom she gave the surname of Aglaurus, and was worshipped in a temple dedi cated to her. The Cyprians also 2 honoured her by the celebration of an
annual festival in the month Aphrodisius, at which they offered human victims; and this custom is said to have continued till the time of Dio
medes.
Aygıávica , in honour of Bacchus, surnamed 'Aygıários, for his cruelty ;" or because he conversed with and was attended by lions, tigers, and other
savage animals, which procured him the other name of ' Runoths, which properly denotes an eater of raw flesh . This solemnity was observed in the night, after this manner : The women being assembled," made a strict search after Bacchus, as if he had fled from them ; but after some time,
finding their labour to be in vain , said , that he had retired to the Muses, and concealed himself amongst them . This being done, and the cere. mony ended, they regaled themselves with an entertainment; after which,
the time was passed away in proposing riddles and cramp questions. Large quantities of ivy were used at this time, because that plant was sacred to Bacchus; and such excesses were sometimes committed , that on one occasion the daughter of Minya, in a furious ecstasy of devotion ,
slaughtered Hippasus, the son of Leucippe, and served him up to the table : in memory of which murder, their whole family was ever after excluded from this festival, upon pain of death ; which ? was inflicted upon one of them that surreptitiously conveyed herself in amongst the rest of the worshippers, by Zoilus, a Chæronean priest.
Aygotipus Ouric ,: an anniversary sacrifice of five hundred goats, offered
at Athens to Minerva , surnamed 'Aygorígue, from Agræ in Attica. The occasion of it was this : when Darius, the emperor of Persia, invaded Attica, Callimachus, the polemarch, made a solemn vow to Minerva, that if
she would grant them victory over their enemies , they would sacrifice to

her as many he- goats as should equal the number of the slain on their enemy's side : Minerva granted his request ; but the number of the Per sians that fell in the battle being so great, that all the he - goats they could
procure did not come near it, they offered instead of them all the she goats they could find ; and these also falling infinitely short of the number,
they made a decree, that five hundred goats should be offered every year till it should be completed.
Aygúrvis, a nocturnal festival,2 celebrated in honour of Bacchus, at Arbela , a place in Sicily ; and so called because the worshippers did
dyguaviv, watch all night. Adávid , or Adwsía, was celebrated in most of the cities of Greece, in honour of Venus, and in memory of her beloved Adonis.3 The solemnity continued two days; upon the first of which certain images or pictures of Adonis and Venus were brought forth with all the pomp and ceremonies
practised at funerals ; the women tore their hair, beat their breasts, and counterfeited all other postures and actions usual in lamenting the dead .
This lamentation was termed αδωνιασμός ,4 or αδωνία " whence αδωνίαν άγειν is interpreted by Suidas, " Adwuv maaluv, to weep for Adonis. on this occasion were called ådwvidice . There were also carried along with them, shells filled with earth , in which grew several sorts of

Abnycia , two festivals observed at Athens, in honour of Minerva ; but One of them was called Παναθήναια , the other Χαλκεία .
Ajáruz, sports at Ægina, in honour of Æacus, who had a temple in that island ; wherein , after the end of the solemnity, the victors used to pre sent a garland of flowers.3
Ajártsia , to Ajax, in the isle of Salamis . Also in Attica, where, in
memory of the value of that hero, a bier, upon set days, was adorned with a complete suit of armour ; and such a pious care the Athenians took of his memory , that his name was continued to posterity in that of one of their tribes, which was from him called Alavtis.
Aigistwy ' Eógrn, was a festival at Ægina, observed in honour of Nep tune, during sixteen successive days; all of which were employed in
mirth and jollity, and in offering sacrifices to the gods. And this was done without the assistance of servants, only by free denizens of that island, who were for that reason called Movopánoi, persons that eat by themselves. After all, the solemnity was ended with offering a sacrifice
to Venus. The occasion and origin of these observances are accounted for by Plutarch in his Greek Questions.
Aipaxouge, a Peloponnesian festival, wherein, xoūpoi, boys were whipped at the sepulchre of Pelops, till, aipa, blood was drawn, whence this so lemnity derived its name.
Aiúpo, Eága, Eidsíxvos, or Anýtis, a festivals and solemn sacrifice , celebrated by the Athenians with vocal music, in honour of Erigone,

sometimes called Aletis, the daughter of Icarius; who, out of an excess of grief for the misfortunes of her father, hanged herself: whence the
solemnity had the name of aiága. At her death she requested the gods, that if the Athenians did not revenge the murder of Icarius, their virgins
might end their lives in the same manner that she did. Her petition was granted, and a great many of them , without any apparent cause of dis content, became their own executioners; whereupon to appease Erigone, they instituted this festival, by the advice of Apollo. Others report, 1 that
it was observed in honour of king Temaleus, or of Ægisthus and Clytem nestra. And some are of opinion, that it was first observed, by command
of an oracle , in memory of the daughter of Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, who, in company of her grandfather Tyndarus, took a journey to Athens,
where she prosecuted Orestes in the court of Areopagus; and losing her cause , hanged herself for grief.

Aybiopogrz, a Sicilian festival,? so named årò to Pigaly é :012, from carrying flowers, because it was instituted in honour of Proserpine, whom Pluto is said to have stolen as she was gathering flowers.3
Another solemnity of this name seems to have been observed at Argos, in honour of Juno, to whom a temple was dedicated in that place under the name of 'Aydzia.4
Ayşıyovgía, sacrifices in honour of Antigonus.”
Aprivocía, annual sacrifices, and quinquennial games, in memory of Antinous the Bithynian ; they were instituted at the command of Adrian , the Roman emperor, at Mantinea in Arcadia, where Antinous was hon oured with a temple and divine worship. ( They were celebrated also at
Argos.) Arutoúpia , a festival first instituted at Athens, and from thence
derived to the rest of the Ionians, except those of Ephesus and Colophon. It received its name from érúrn, deceit, because it was instituted in memory of a stratagem by which Melanthius, the Athenian king, over
came Xanthus, king of Boeotia. For a controversy happening between the Athenians and Boeotians, about a piece of ground situated on the con fines of Attica and Boeotia, Xanthus made a proposal, that himself and the Athenian king should end the quarrel by a single combat. Thymoetes reigned at that time in Athens, but declining the fight, was deposed. His

successor was Melanthius, a Messenian , son of Neleus and Periclymene, who, having accepted the challenge, met his enemy at the appointed place ; where, as they were just going to begin the fight, Melanthius thinking, or pretending, that he saw at Xanthus' back a person habited in a black goat skin , cried out that the articles were violated ; upon this Xanthus looking back, was treacherously slain by Melanthius. In memory of this success ,
Jupiter was surnamed 'Arashwe, Deceiver ; and Bacchus, who was sup posed to be behind Xanthus, Msaavagis, clothed in a black goat- skin ; and was farther honoured with a new temple, and the institution of this festi
val. Others are of opinion, that 'Aratoúgre are so called q. áratégia , i. e.
ÓMoratógie, because, upon this festival, children accompanied theirfathers, to have their names entered into the public register: after the same man
ner, άλοχος is equivalent to ομόλεκτρος, and άκοιτις tο ομόκοιτος . Others will have ' Atatoupice to be so named , because the children were till that
time åréroges, without fathers , in a civil sense ; for that it was not till then publicly recorded whose they were. For a like reason , Melchisedec
is by some thought to be called årátwg, knitwe, without father, without "mother ; namely, because his parentage was omitted in the sacred gene
alogies. To return : this festival was celebrated in the month Pyanepsion , and lasted three days.
The first was called Δορπία , from δόρπος, α εupper ; because on that day at evening, each tribe had a separate meeting, whereat a sumptuous en tertainment was provided.
The second day was named 'Ανάρρυσις , από του άνω ερύειν, because on
this day victims were offered to Jupiter øgárpios, and ’Agathvwg, and to Minerva, in whose sacrifices, as in all that were offered to the celestial gods, it was usual ävw epússy Tès raparàs, to turn the heads of the victims up to wards heaven. At this sacrifice, the children enrolled amongst citizens
were placed close to the altar. It was usual also, for persons richly appa
relled , to take lighted torches out of the fire, and to run about, singing hymns in praise of Vulcan , who was the first that taught men the use of
that element: which custom is by Meursius referred to this day, though Harpocration , to whom we are indebted for the mention of it, has left us in the dark as to its time.

OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE. 347
To these Hesychius adds a fourth day, which he tells us was called 'Erißóns; but that name is not peculiar to this festival, but generally applied to any day celebrated after the end of another solemnity ; being
derived å trò tūriaives , fromfollowing ; because it was a sort of append age to the great festival.
This festival was observed five days by the Protenthæ , who began it a day sooner than others. There was also a decree made, when Cephesi
dorus was chief archon, whereby the senate was forbidden to meet for five
days, during the time of the solemnity.” Ataúrs , the second day in marriages, of which I shall have an oppor tunity to speak in another place. Agodtáva, to Apollo at Ægialea, upon this account: Apollo, having
obtained a victory over Python, went to Ægialea, accompanied with his sister Diana; but being frighted from thence, fled into Crete. After this
the Ægialeans were infected with an epidemical distemper; and being
advised by the prophets to appease the two offended deities, sent seven boys and as many virgins, to entreat them to return . Apollo and Diana
accepted their piety , and came with them to the citadel of Ægialea: in memory of which, a temple was dedicated to Pytho, the goddess of per suasion ; and it became a custom to appoint chose boys and virgins to
make a solemn procession, in show as if they designed to bring back Apollo and Diana .
ATOTOUTAI, certain days in which sacrifices were offered to the gods, called Tourruño ." Who these were is doubtful. Certain it is, that roll
Freios denotes any person that conducts another in his way ; and therefore was applied to Mercury, who was believed to be Pluto's gentleman - usher, and to conduct the souls of deceased persons to the shades below . But I
am rather inclined to think, these days belonged to the gods called 'Aro.

the choristers of Bacchus assisted in the solemnity with harps. There was
also a solemn procession , in which the public schoolmaster, accompanied
with his scholars, went first, and the senators, adorned with garlands, with as many of the other citizens as had a mind , followed .
Agysiw 'Eóptı, festivals at Argos, the names of which are lost. One
we find mentioned in Parthenius, upon which, he tells us, there was a public entertainment.
Another is taken notice of in Plutarch,2 upon which the boys called one another in jest βαλλαχράδας , i. e. βάλλοντας άχράδας, by which words are signified persons that throw wildfigs. Which custom, perhaps, was insti
tuted in memory of their ancient diet in Inachus' time, when they lived upon wild figs.
A third we read of in Æneas,) in which great numbers of the citizens
made a solemn procession out of the city in armour. Agrádvud, two festivals at Naxos ,4 in honour of two women, who had one common name of Ariadne. The former of them was thought to be of a
gay and pleasant temper, and therefore her festival was to be observed with music, and many other expressions of joy and mirth .
The latter, being the same that was exposed big with child upon that coast by Theseus, was supposed to be of a melancholy dis sition , and
therefore the solemnity dedicated to her had a show of sorrow and mourn ing ; and in memory of her being left by Theseus near the time of child
birth, it was usual for a young man to lie down and counterfeit all the agonies of women in labour. This festival is said to have been first insti
tuted by Theseus, as a recompense of his ingratitude to her.5
Aggnpágre, at Athens, in the month Scirrophorion , in honour of Minerva, and Ersa, one of Cecrops' daughters, upon which account it is

certain oasprothgrov, or ball- court, appropriated for their use in the Acro polis, wherein stood a brazen statue of Isocrates on horseback . Out of these were chosen two to weave, as the custom was, a rimos, or garment,
for Minerva ; which work they began on the thirtieth of Pyanepsion .
Aprepíois, a festival in honour of " Apteps, or Diana . It was celebrated in several places of Greece, particularly at Delphi, where they offered a mullet to the goddess, as being thought to bear some sort of relation to her; because it is said to hunt, and kill the sea -hare.5 The bread offered
to the goddess was termed nogerà ;6 and the women who performed the Sacred rites were called λόμβαι..? Another solemnity of this name was observed three days together, with banquets and sports, at Syracuse.8 Arxahtera , a festival of Æsculapius, observed in several parts of
Greece , but no where with so much solemnity as by the Epidaurians, whom this god honoured with his more immediate presence, giving an
swers to them in an oracular way : wherefore it was called Msyaduoxas Fila , the greatfestival of Æsculapius.10 One great part of the solemnity consisted of a musical entertainment, wherein the poets and musicians
contended for victory, and therefore was called 'legos cywn,the sacred con tention ,
Arxárse, a festival celebrated by the Athenian husbandmen, in honour of Bacchus,11 to whom they sacrificed a he- goat; because that animal destroys the vines, and therefore was supposed to be hated by Bacchus. Out of the victim's skin it was customary to make a bottle, which being filled with oil and wine, they endeavoured to leap upon it with one foot, and he that first fixed himself upon it, was declared victor, and received
the bottle as a reward . The doing this they called άσκωλιάζειν, παρά το irà tòy toxòy ünneclan, from leaping upon a bottle; whence this festival has its name.12
Apeodiance, festivals in honour of ' AQgodion, or Venus ; several of which were observed in divers parts of Greece: the most remarkable of them
was that at Cyprus,13 first instituted by Cinyras ; out of whose family cer tain priests of Venus were elected , and for that reason named Kurupúdos.

At this solemnity several mysterious rites were practised ; all that were
initiated into them offered a piece of money to Venus, as a harlot, and received , as a token of the goddess's favour, a measure of salt and a
panaós : the former because salt is a concretion of sea -water , to which
Verus was thought to owe her birth ; the latter because she was the god dess of wantonness .
At Amathus, a city of Cyprus, solemn sacrifices were offered to Venus,
and called Kagitóoes ;d which word is derived from xagaròs, fruit; per haps because this goddess presided over generation . At both the Paphi Venus' festival was observed , not only by the inha . bitants of those places, but by multitudes that thronged to it out of other cities.?

The most remarkable persons at this solemnity were young virgins habited
in yellow gowns, and consecrated to Diana. These were usually about tenyears of age ( it being unlawful for any of them to be above ten or
under five) ; and therefore to consecrate them was called dexatibuy, from dira, ten : it was called åprtiheis, and the virgins themselves were named Aprto, bears, upon this account: amongst the Phlauidæ, inhabitants of a borough in Attica, there was a bear which was so far divested of its natural
fierceness, and became so tame and tractable, that they usually admitted it to eat and play with them , and received no harm thereby ; but a young
maid once unluckily happening to be too familiar with it, the beast tore
her to pieces, and was afterwards killed by the virgin's brethren ; upon this ensued a dreadful pestilence, which proved very fatal to many of the
inhabitants of Attica ; as a remedy for which they were advised by an oracle to appease the anger of Diana for the bear, by consecrating virgins to her in memory of it. The Athenians punctually executed the divine command, and enacted a law , that no virgin should be married till she had undergone the ceremony.

The other solemnity was by far the greatest and most remarkable, being celebrated not only by Platæa, but all the cities of Boeotia, once in sixty years ; in memory , and , as it were, in recompense for the intermission of
the lesser festival the same number of years, during which time the Pla tæans had lived in exile. In order to this solemnity, there were always
prepared fourteen Axidana at the other festivals, to be distributed by lots
amongst the Platæans, Coroneans, Thespians, Tanagræans, Chæroneans, Orchomenians, Lebadeans, and Thebans; because they promoted a recon ciliation with the Platæans, and were desirous to have them recalled from
banishment, and contributed offerings towards the celebration of this festival, about the time that Thebes was restored by Cassander, the son of
Antipater. Nor did the forementioned cities only, but other cities of
lesser note join in this solemnity ; the manner of which was thus : A statue being adorned in woman's apparel, upon the banks of Asopus, a woman, in the habit of a bride-maid, was appointed to accompany it,
being followed by a long train of Boeotians, who had places assigned them by lots, to the top of mount Cithæron ; upon which an altar of square pieces of timber, cemented together in the manner of stones, was erected . Upon this, large quantities of combustible matter being laid, each of the cities, and such men as were possessed of plentiful estates, offered a bull
to Jupiter, and an ox or heifer to Juno, with plenty of wine and incense : the poorer sort, and such as were not of ability to purchase more costly oblations, contributed small sheep ; all which, together with the Aqidada, being thrown into one common heap, were set on fire, and not extinguished till the whole fabric, of which the altar itself made a part, was consumed to ashes. The first occasion of these customs was this : on a time, it
happened that Juno had a quarrel with Jupiter, whereby the goddess was exasperated to such a degree that she departed from him, and retired into Euboea. The god was very much troubled at this desertion , and endea
voured by all the arts of persuasion , to engage her to return ; but finding her obstinate in her resolution, went to advise with Cithæron, who reigned
at that time over the Platæans, and had the greatest reputation for wisdom any man in that age. The expedient he advised to, was this : that

Jupiter should dress a statue in woman's apparel, and place it in a chariot, giving out that it was Platæa, the daughter of Asopus, and that she was contracted to him in marriage. The god approved his counsel, and put it in practice ; and the report had no sooner reached Juno, but she posted with all haste to meet the chariot; where, having discovered the cheat ,
she was wonderfully taken with the contrivance, and returned into favour with her husband.
An entire treatise was composed by Plutarch upon this festival, some fragments of which are still preserved in Eusebius, and confirm the substance of the relation now given out of Pausanias ; from whom they only differ in this, that in them Cithæron is called Alalcomenes ; and Platæa, Dædala.
Aapón, a festival of which nothing remains besides the name, which is preserved by Hesychius. If the conjecture of Meursius deserve any credit, it will not be improbable that it belonged to one Daron, who, as the same grammarian informs us, was worshipped by the Macedonians, and thought to restore health to sick persons.
Aaúrss, a solemnity at Argos, in which was represented the combat of Proetus and Acrisius.
Aupinpógice, a novennial festival, celebrated by the Boeotians in honour
of Apollo.? The chief solemnity was thus : they adorned an olive bough with garlands of laurel, and various sorts of flowers ; upon the top of it was placed a globe of brass, from which hung other lesser globes ; about the middle were fixed to it purple crowns, and a globe of smaller size than that at the top : the bottom was covered with a garment of a saffron colour . The uppermost globe was an emblem of the sun, by whom they meant Apollo ; that placed diametrically under it signified the moon ; the lesser globes represented the stars; and the crowns, which were three hun
dred and sixty - five in number, represented the sun's annual revolution ,
which is completed in about the same number of days. The bough thus adorned, was carried in procession ; the chief in which was a boy of a beautiful countenance and good parentage , whose father and mother were both living ; he was apparelled in a sumptuous garment, reaching down to his ancles: his hair hung loose and dishevelled ; on his head was a crown of gold ; and upon his feet shoes, called iphicratida , from Iphicrates, an Athenian , the first inventor of them . It was his duty to execute, at that
time, the priest's office, and he was honoured with the title of Acompégs , laurel-bearer . Before him went one of his nearest relations, bearing a
rod adorned with garlands: after the boy followed a choir of virgins, with
branches in their hands ; and in this order they proceeded as far as the
temple of Apollo, surnamed Ismenius, and Galaxius, where they sung supplicatory hymns to the god. These ceremonies were first practised upon this account: the Æolians that inhabited Arne, and the adjacent
territory, being advised by an oracle to relinquish their old seats, and to

seek their fortunes, made an invasion upon the Thebans, who at the same
time were besieged by the Pelasgians: it happened to be near the time of Apollo's festival, which was religiously observed by both nations; where fore, a cessation of arms being granted on both sides, one party cut down laurel boughs in Helicon, the other near the river Melas ; and, as the cus tom was , carried them in their hands in honour of Apollo. On the same day, there appeared in a dream to Polemates, general of the Boeotian forces, a young man , who presented him with a complete suit of armour, and commanded that every ninth year the Boeotians should offer solemn prayers to Apollo, with laurel in their hands: three days after this vision, he made a sally on the besiegers with such success, that they were forced to quit their enterprise ; whereupon he caused this festival to be insti tuted .1

Another solemnity was every year celebrated in this island, in honour of Apollo, by the Athenians; but of this I have already given you an account .
Anuárgie, a solemnity in honour of Ceres, called by the Greeks Anpán ang, in which it was customary for the worshippers to lash themselves with whips, made of the bark of trees, and called rúgot T06. Anot festival of this name was observed by the Athenians, in honour
of Demetrius Poliorcetes, being the same with that which was before
called Dionysia, and celebrated upon the thirteenth of Munychion , whose name was changed into Demetrion ; as also the day of this solemnity was named Demetrias.
Alauaotivwois, a solemnity at Sparta,3 in honour of Diana Orthia, so named étò FOū MUCtiyoūv, from whipping, because it was usual to whip boys upon the goddess' altar. These boys were, at first, freeborn Spar
tans; but, in more delicate ages, of meaner birth, being frequently the offspring of slaves : they were called BwMovsixes, from the exercise they underwent at the altar, and which was very severe and cruel ; and lest the officer should , out of compassion, remit any thing of the rigour of it, Diana's priestess stood by all the time, holding in her hand the goddess' image, which of itself was very light and easy to be borne, but if the boys were spared , became so ponderous , that the priestess was scarce able to support its weight. And lest the boys should faint under correction , or
do any thing unworthy of Laconian education, their parents were usually present, to exhort them to bear whatever was inflicted upon them with
patience and constancy. And so great were the bravery and resolution of the boys, that though they were lashed till the blood gushed out, and
sometimes to death, yet a cry or groan was seldom or never heard to pro ceed from any of them. Those of them that died by this means were buried with garlands upon their head, in token of joy or victory, and had the honour of a public funeral. Whence this custom had its origin , is not agreed by ancient writers .
By some it is said to have been one of Lycurgus' institutions, and designed for no other end than to accustom the youth to endure pain, thereby to render them fearless and insensible of wounds. Others will have it done
as a mitigation of an oracle, whereby it was commanded, that human blood should be shed upon Diana's altar . By some, it is reported to have been
as ancient as Orestes, who, say they, transplanted out of Scythia into La conia the image of Diana Taurica, to whom the Scythians used to offer human victims ; this barbarous sort ofworship the Lacedæmonians detested :
but withal, fearing the anger of the goddess, made an order , that every year a boy should be whipped upon her altar, till the blood gushed out ;

and so, if nothing could satisfy her but human blood , she might not be
altogether destitute of it. Lastly, some assign this cause for it : Pausa nias, the Spartan general, as he was offering sacrifices and prayers, before the fight with Mardonius, was set upon by a company of Lydians, who plundered and squandered abroad the sacrifice ; but were at length repelled with whips and staves, which were the only arms the Lacedæmonians were
at that time furnished with. In memory of this victory, the whipping of boys at the altar of Sparta, and after that, the Lydian procession, Plutarch tells us, was performed till his days. Alcytívice, a festival at Sparta.

It was celebrated about the latter end of Anthesterion , without the city, where was a great concourse of all the Athenians feasting and offering sacrifices : at the same time there is said to have been a public mart, in which all sorts of vendi
bles were exposed to sale ; whence Strepsiades in Aristophanes says, he bought his son Phidippides a little chariot at this festival: 2

certain cakes, of the same sort with those used at sacrifices, upon a table of brass ; round this they drove a select number of oxen , of which he that ate any of the cakes was presently slaughtered. The person that killed the ox was called Bourns , or Boupóvos. No less than three families

was thus : on one of Jupiter's festivals, it happened that a hungry ox ate up one of the consecrated cakes ; whereupon the priest (some call him Thaulon, others Diomus, or Sopater), moved with a pious zeal , killed the profane beast. In those days it was looked upon as a capital crime to kill
an ox ; wherefore the guilty priest was forced to secure himself by a timely flight; and the Athenians, in his stead, took the bloody axe, arraigned it,

and, according to Pausanias, brought it in not guilty ; but Ælian is of
another opinion , and reports, that the priest and people present at the solemnity (for they also were accused as being accessory to the fact) were acquitted, but the axe condemned, which seems to be the most probable.
In memory of these actions, it became ever after customary for the priest to fly, and judgment to be given about the slaughter of the ox .
Asztúra, a Spartan festival, in honour of Diana, surnamed Dictynna, from a city of Crete ; or from a Cretan nymph, one of her companions in

360 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
At some of them it was usual for the worshippers, in their garments
and actions, to imitate the poetical fictions concerning Bacchus : they put on fawn -skins, fine linen , and mítres ; carried thyrsi, drums, pipes, flutes, and rattles ; and crowned themselves with garlands of trees sacred to Bac chus ; such were the ivy, vine, fir , &c. Some imitated Silenus, Pan, and
the satyrs, exposing themselves in comical dresses and antic motions:
some rode upon asses, others drove goats to the slaughter. In this man ner, persons of both sexes ran about the hills, deserts, and other places, wagging their heads, dancin in ridiculous postures, filling the air with
hideous noises, and yelling, personating men distracted, and crying aloud , Evo súbor, Eso Báxxs , or w " lanx , or ’ lóßurys, or ’IW Bézxs.
Such were the rites used in most of the festivals of Bacchus throughout Greece. At Athens, this frantic rout was, upon one of the solemnities of
this god, followed by persons carrying sacred vessels, the first of which was filled with water ; after these went a select number of honourable virgins, called Karnpógon, because they carried little baskets of gold filled with all
sorts of fruit. In these consisted the most mysterious part of the solem nity ; and therefore, to amuse the common people, serpents were put into
them , which sometimes crawling out of their places astonished the be holders. Next was the ligipanaía, being a company of men carrying
Tous Qanaows, which were poles, to the ends of which were fixed things in the form of a man's privities : these persons were crowned with violets
and ivy, and had their faces covered with other herbs ; they were called Φαλλοφόροι, and the Songs repeated by them Φαλλικά άσματα . After these followed the ' Idupandos, in women's apparel, with garments striped
with white, and reaching to their ancles, garlands on their heads, gloves
composed of flowers on their hands, and in their gestures imitating drunk
There were also certain persons called Asxvopógoi, whose office it was to carry the Aixvox, or mystical van of Bacchus, a thing so essential
to this and other solemnities and sacrifices of this god, that few of them could be duly celebrated without it ; whence ne is sometimes called Aix vírns . At this time, also, public shows, plays, and sports, were frequent ed, and the whole city was filled with revelling and licentiousness, The festivals of Bacchus were almost innumerable ; the names of some of the most remarkable of them are as follow :
Διονύσια αρχαιότερα, celebrated upon the twelfth of Anthesterion , at Limnæ in Attica, where was a temple of Bacchus. The chief persons
that officiated were fourteen women , appointed by the Beoinsùs , who was one of the archons, and provided necessaries for the solemnity : they were called rigripai, renerable, and could not enter upon their office till they had taken an Oath in presence of the Bασίλισσα , or wife of the Bασιλεύς , that they were free from all manner of pollution .

Asaruou pesyana , or the greater, sometimes called ' Actixu, or cà xut' žotu, as being celebrated within the city, in the month Elaphebolion, It is sometimes, by way of eminence, called Asovúoia, without any distin guishing epithet, because it was the most celebrated of all Bacchus' festi

Asovúola 'Agradinà, was an anniversary day in Arcadia, where the chil. dren, having been instructed in the music of Philoxenus and Timotheus, were brought yearly to the theatre, where they celebrated the feast of Bac
chus with songs, dances, and games.6 Several other festivals were observed in honour of this god, as the tri
ennial solemnity, called from the time of its celebration Abovúoice opierings nie,? which is said to have been first instituted by Bacchus himself, in
memory of his expedition into India, in which he spent three years. Another also is mentioned by the scholiast of Aristophanes,& and said to
be observed every fifth year . And besides these, we find frequent men tion of Bacchus' festivals in most of the ancient authors, some of which
are described in other places. Asoxúgice, in honour of Aborough, or Castor and Pollux, who were re puted to be the sons of Jupiter. It was observed by the Cyrenæans,9 but more especially by the Spartans, 10 whose country was honoured by the birth
of these keroes. The solemnity was full of mirth , being a time wherein they shared plentifully of the gifts of Bacchus, and diverted themselves
with sports, of which wrestling matches always made a part.

the Stratonicensians, who were wont to assemble at this time in great numbers.
The Athenians also had a great veneration for this goddess, believing that she was the overseer of their families, and protected their children ; whence it was customary to erect statues to her before the doors of their
liouses, which, from the goddess' name, were called 'Exaraia . Every
new moon there was a public (Osīt you) supper, provided at the charge of the richer sort, which was no sooner brought to the accustomed place, but the poor people carried all off, giving out that Hecate had devoured it ;3 whence it was called ' Exérns Osimyov, or Hecate's supper. This was done
in a place where three ways met, because this goddess was supposed to have a threefold nature , or three offices, in allusion to which she was known by three names, being called in the infernal regions, Hecate ; in
heaven, Esaávn, or the Moon ; and upon the earth, " Agtsess, or Diana : whence it is we find a great many names attributed to her, derived from
the number three, or bearing some relation to it ; as Teoríuntos, Teigan 995 , Tgigacebhun, Tgsodirn, Trivia , Tergemina, Tritonia , with several others.
The reason why Hecate was placed in the public ways, rather than other
deities, was ότι επί των καθαρμάτων και μιασμάτων θεός, because she pre sided over piacular pollutions:' and the above mentioned sacrifices or sup pers (δείπνα ) αποτροπαίων και καθαρσίων επέχει μοίραν, were expiatory offer ings to move this goddess to avert any evils which might impend by rea son of piacular crimes committed in the highways.6 'ExaróuBora, a festival celebrated in honour of Juno,7 by the Argians,

and Æginensians, who were a colony from Argos. It was so called from
frarósefn, which signifies a sacrifice consisting of a hundred oxen ; it
being usual, upon the first day of this solemnity, to offer so many to Juno, the relics of all which were distributed amongst the citizens. There were also at this time public sports, first instituted by Archinus, one of the
kings of Argos ; the prize was a brazen shield and a crown of myrtle. There was also an anniversary sacrifice called by this name in Laconia , and offered for the preservation of the hundred cities, which once flour ished in that country .
'Eratorpóric, a solemn sacrifice to Jupiter, offered by the Messenians, when any of them killed a hundred enemies.?
" Erduoio, a festival observed by the Phæstians in honour of Latona, upon this account:3 Galatea, the daughter of Eurytius, was married to Lam
prus, the son of Pandion, a citizen of Phæstus in Crete : who, being of an honourable family, but wanting an estate answerable to his birth, and being unable to provide competent fortunes for daughters, had commanded his wife, that if she was brought to bed of a daughter, she should imme
diately put her to death. This done, he went to look after his flock , and before his return Galatea was delivered of a daughter, but being overcome
by maternal affection, resolved to disobey her husband's cruel command :
wherefore, to secure the infant, she called it Leucippus, telling her hus hand it was a boy. At length, being no longer able to conceal the arti fice, she fled for succour to Latona's temple, where, with abundance of
earnestness, she entreated the goddess, that, if it was possible, her virgin might be transformed into a boy. Latona, moved with compassion ,
granted her request, and was thence by the Phæstians called Qúria, dà có
Qútiv rehồece cã nógn, because the maid changed her sex ; and 'Ezdusix , eze To any ruida indúzy tòy gitov, because she Put OFF her woman's apparel.
Enconßónoc, in honour of Diana, surnamed 'Elaonlóaos , the huntress ; for which reason, a cake made in the form of a deer, and upon that account called (napos, was offered to her. This festival was instituted upon this occasion : the Phocensians being reduced to the last extremity by the
Thessalians, and disdaining to submit to them, Daïphantus proposed that a vast pile of combustible matter should he erected, upon which they
should place their wives, children , and their whole substance ; and in case they were defeated , set all on fire together, that nothing might come into the hands of their enemies. But it being judged by no means reasonable
so to dispose of the women without their consent, they summoned them to the public assembly ; where, being met in a full body, the proposal was no sooner offered to them , than, with unanimous consent, they gave their approbation of it, applauding Daïphantus, and decreeing him a crown , in reward of so generous and noble a contrivance ; the boys also are said to have met and consented to it. Things being in this posture, they went

to meet their enemies, whom they engaged with such fury and resolution ,
that those by whom they had just been before reduced to extreme despair, were entirely defeated by them . In memory of which victory this festi..
val was instituted, and observed with more solemnity, and frequently by greater numbers of worshippers, than any other in that country. Here you may take notice of the proverb, bwxéwy åróvoid, Phocensian despair,
which is applied to persons lost beyond all hopes of recovery , and is said to have taken its origin from this story.

Elevbigice, at Platæa,3 to Jupiter Eleutherius, or the assertor of liberty, by delegates from almost all the cities of Greece. It was instituted upon this account: Mardonius, the Persian general, being defeated in the ter
ritories of Platæa, by the Grecians, under the conduct of Pausanias the Spartan, the Platæans erected an altar, and a statue of white marble, to
Jupiter Eleutherius, by whose assistance they supposed the Grecians had asserted the liberties of Greece against the force of the barbarians ; and a
general assembly being summoned from all parts of Greece, Aristides the
Athenian, proposed that deputies might be sent every fifth year from the
cities of Greece, to celebrate ' Easubégia , the games of liberty ; which was and great prizes appointed to be contended for.
The Platæans also kept an anniversary solemnity, in memory of those
that had valiantly lost their lives in defence of their country's liberty, of which the manner was thus: on the sixteenth of the month Mæmacterion, which with the Boeotians is Alalcomenius, a procession was made, begin
ning about break of day. It was led by a trumpeter, sounding a point of
war ; then followed certain chariots, laden with myrrh, garlands, and a
black bull; after these came young men, freeborn , it not being permitted any person of servile cond to ass at any part of the solemnity, be
cause the men in whose memory it was instituted died in defence of the liberty of Greece ; these carried libations of wine and milk , in large two . eared vessels, and jars of oil, and precious ointments : last of all came the chief magistrate, for whom, though it was unlawful at other times to touch any thing of iron , or wear garments of any colour but white, yet he was
then clad in a purple robe, and taking a water -pot out of the city-chamber, proceeded with a sword in his hand through the middle of the town to the
sepulchres: then he drew water out of a neighbouring spring, and washed and anointed the monuments ; then sacrificed the bull upon a pile of wood ,
making supplication to infernal Mercury, and Jupiter, and invited the souls of those valiant heroes that lost their lives in defence of their coun
try, to the entertainment; then filling the bowl of wine, said , I drink to

those that lost their lives for the liberty of Greece. These solemnities,
Plutarch tells us, were observed till his days. Another festival of this name was observed by the Samians, in honour of the god of love .
It was also customary for slaves to keep a holiday called by this name, when they obtained liberty. To which custom there is an allusion in
Plautus," who introduces a slave, named Toxilus, rejoicing that his master
was gone from home, and promising himself as much pleasure as if he had obtained his freedom ; whence he makes him to say,

It was the most celebrated and mysterious solem nity of any in Greece ; whence it was often called , by way of eminence,

superstitiously careful were they to conceal the sacred rites, that if any person divulged any part of them , he was thought to have called down
some divine judgment upon his head, and it was accounted unsafe to abide
in the same house with him ; wherefore he was apprehended as a public
offender, and suffered death . Every thing contained a mystery ; Ceres herself (to whom, with her daughter Proserpine, this solemnity was sacred), was not called by her own name, but by the unusual title of "Ax8996 , which seems to be derived from axbos, grief or heaviness, because of her sorrow for the loss of her daughter, when she was stolen by Pluto. This secrecy was strictly enjoined, not only in Attica, but in all other places
of Greece where this festival was observed, except Crete ; insomuch that
if any person that was not lawfully initiated, did but, through ignorance or mistake, chance to be present at the mysterious rites, he was put to
death. It is said by some to have been first instituted by Ceres herself, when she had supplied the Athenians with corn in a time of famine. Others attribute both those facts to king Erechtheus : some will have it to
have been instituted by Musæus, the father of Eumolpus; others by Eu molpus himself.
Persons of both sexes, and all ages, were initiated at this solemnity . Nor was it a thing indifferent, whether they would be so or not, for the
vieglect of it was looked upon as a crime of a very heinous nature ; inso much that it was one part of the accusation for which Socrates was con
demned to death . All persons initiated were thought to live in a state of greater happiness and security than other men, being under the more
immediate care and protection of the goddess : nor did the benefit of it extend only to this life ; but after death too, they enjoyed , as was believed,
far greater degrees of felicity than others, and were honoured with the first places in the Elysian shades ; whereas others were forced to wallow in perpetual dirt, stink, and nastiness.

all strangers, that is, all that were not members of their own common wealth . Hence, when Hercules, Castor, and Pollux, desired to be
initiated, they were first made citizens of Athens, as we learn from Plutarch. Now were they admitted to the Μυστήρια μεγάλα, or greater mysteries, but only to the virgà , or less, which were sacred to Proserpine, and first instituted on this account: on a time when the Athenians were
celebrating the accustomed solemnity, Hercules happening to go that way, desired he might be initiated ; but it being unlawful for any stranger to
enjoy that privilege, and yet Hercules being a person who, by reason of his great power, and the extraordinary services he had done for them ,
could not be denied, Eumolpus thought of an expedient, whereby to satisfy the hero's request, without violating the laws; which he did by instituting another solemnity, which was called Moxgà protagoa, or the lesser myste ries, which were afterwards solemnly observed in the month Anthesterion , at Agræ , a place near the river Illissus; whereas the greater were cele
brated in the month Boëdromion, at Eleusis, an Attic borough, from which Ceres was called Eleusinia. In latter times, the lesser festival was
used as a preparative to the greater ; for no persons were initiated in the greater, unless they had been purified at the lesser, the manner of which
purification was thus: having kept themselves chaste and unpolluted nine days, they came and offered sacrifices and prayers, wearing crowns and garlands of flowers, which were called " Iouegee, or " Ipesca ; they had also under their feet aròs xúdiov, Jupiter's skin , which was the skin of a victim
offered to that god . The person that assisted them herein was called ' Togavès, from üdwe, water, which was used at most purifications: them selves were named Muotas, persons initiated . About a year after, having sacrificed a sow to Ceres, they were admitted to the greater mysteries, the secret rites of which, some few excepted, to which none but the priests were conscious, were frankly revealed to them ;
whence they were called "Epogos, and 2 'ErÓTTUı, inspectors. The manner of initiation was thus : the candidates being crowned with myrtle, had admittance by night into a place called Murtixòs onxòs, the mystical tem ple, which was an edifice so vast and capacious, that the most ample theatre did scarce exceed it. At their entrance, they purified themselves by washing their hands in holy water ; and, at the same time, were
admonished to present themselves with minds pure and undefiled , without which the external cleanness of the body would by no means be accepted.
After this, the holy mysteries were read to them out of a book called
Ilérgwia ; which word is derived from rippa, a stone, because the book was nothing else but two stones fitly cemented together. Then the priest that initiated them , called 'ligopóleons, proposed certain questions, as
whether they were fasting ? &c., to which they returned answers in a set form, as may be seen in Meursius' treatise on this festival, to which I refer the reader. This done, strange and amazing objects presented

themselves ; sometimes the place they were in seemed to shake round them, sometimes appeared bright and resplendent with light and radiant fire, and then again covered with black darkness and horror; some times thunder and lightning ; sometimes frightful noises and bellow ings ; sometimes terrible apparitions astonished the trembling spectators. The being present at these sights was called Aŭtobia , intuition . After
this they were dismissed in these words, Kòys, "Ourot. The garments in which they were initiated were accounted sacred, and of no less efficacy to avert evils than charms and incantations ; and therefore were never cast
ofl'till they were torn and tattered ; nor was it then usual to throw them away, but they made swaddling clothes of them for their children , or con secrated them to Ceres and Proserpine.
The chief person that attended at the initiation was called 'Isgopávrns, a revealer of holy things : he was a citizen of Athens, and held his office
during life ( though amongst the Celeans and Phliasians it was customary for him to resign his place every fourth year, which was the time of this fes tival); he was farther obliged to devote himself wholly to divine service, and to live a chaste and single life ; to which end it was usual for him to anoint himself with the juice of hemlock, which, by its extreme coldness,
is said to extinguish in a great measure the natural heat. The hierophantes had three assistants ; the first of whom was called from his office, Aądoőxos,
torch -bearer ; and to him it was permitted to marry . The second was called Käguš, of whose office I have already given an account. The third min istered at the altar, and was, for that reason , named ' O ità Tã Bwhen .
Hierophantes is said to have been a type of the great Creator of all things ;

day of that mouth, during which time it was unlawful to arrest any man , or present any petition ; and such as were found guilty of these practices were fined a thousand drachms, or, as others report, put to death . It was
also unlawful for those that were initiated to sit upon the covering of a well, or to eat beans, mullets, or weazles. If any woman rode in a chariot
to Eleusis, she was, by an edict of Lycurgus, obliged to pay six thousand
drachms. The design of which order was to prevent the richer women from distinguishing themselves from those which were poor . 1. The first day was called ' Azuqueos, an assembly ; because , it may be, then the worshippers first met together.
2. The second was named "Arade Múoran, to the sea , you that are initi.
ated ; because, I suppose, they were commanded to purify themselves by washing in the sea.
3. Upon the third they offered sacrifices, which consisted chiefly of an Æxonian mullet, in Greek, Tgiyan, and barley out of Rharium , a field of Eleusis, in which that sort of corn was first sown . These oblations were
called @ úa, and accounted so sacred , that the priest themselves were not, as was usual in other offerings, allowed to partake of them . 4. Upon the fourth they made a solemn procession , wherein the make Boov, or holy basket of Ceres, was carried in a consecrated cart ; crowds of
people shouting as they went along, Xaīgs, Ampeñteg, hail, Ceres ! After
these followed certain women, called Kiotopógor, who, as the name implies, carried certain baskets : in these were contained sesamin , carded wool,
some grains of salt, a serpent, pomegranates, reeds, ivy -boughs, and a sort of cakes called plois, poppies, &c.
5. The fifth was called 'H Târ a experádwy spiga, the torch -day ; because , on the night following it, the men and women ran about with torches in
their hands. It was also customary to dedicate torches to Ceres, and to contend who should present the biggest; which was done in memory of Ceres' journey, wherein she sought Proserpine, being conducted by the light of a torch , kindled in the flames of Etna.
6. The sixth was called " Icexxos, from Iacchus, the son of Jupiter and Ceres, who accompanied the goddess in her search after Proserpine, with
a torch in his hand ; whence it is that his statue held a torch. This statue was carried from the Ceramicus to Eleusis in solemn procession , called
after the hero's name " largos. The statue, and the persons that accom
panied it, had their heads crowned with myrtle : these were named ’I xxoywyoù, and all the way danced, and sung, and beat brazen kettles.
The way by which they issued out of the city was called ' Iepà odos, the sacred way : the resting -place, 'Ispà ourñ, from a fig - tree, which grew there , and was, like all other things concerned in this solemnity , accounted sacred. It was also customary to rest upon a bridge built over the river
Cephissus, where they made themselves merry by jesting on those that passed by ; whence yequçiçw, being derived from yiquer, a bridge, is by

Suidas expounded xasválwy, mocking or jeering ; and yepupio tai are , hy Hesychius, interpreted ox@TTI!, scoffers. Having passed this bridge, they went to Eleusis, the way into which was called Muotinn sioodos, the
mystical entrance .
7. Upon the seventh day were sports, in which the victors were re
warded with a measure of barley, as that grain had been first sown in Eleusis.
8. The eighth was called 'Eridavgiwe huégue, because it once happened that Æsculapius, coming from Epidaurus to Athens, and desiring to be initiated , had the lesser mysteries repeated ; whence it became customary to celebrate them a second time upon this day, and admit to initiation such persons as had not before enjoyed that privilege.
9. The ninth and last day of the festival was called Impozóan, earthen vessels ; because it was usual to fill two such vessels with wine ; one of
which being placed towards the east, and the other towards the west, after
the repetition of certain mystical words, they were both thrown down, and the wine being spilt upon the ground, was offered as a libation ."

The other festival was celebrated by the Corinthians, with solemn games and races , in which young men contended, running with lighted
torches in their hands. It was instituted in honour of Minerva, surnamed

yacoy, because by her assistance Bellerophon caught Pegasus, the winged
horse, and brought him under command, which some take to be the first reason of the celebration of this festival. Others are of opinion, that this name was given to the goddess from one Hellotis, a Corinthian woman ;
the story runs thus : - The Dorians being assisted by the posterity of Her
cules , made an invasion upon Peloponnesus where they took and burned Corinth : most of the women took care to secure themselves by an early
flight; only some few , amongst whom were Hellotis and Eurytione, be took themselves to Minerva's temple, hoping that the sanctity of the place
would be a sufficient protection for them. No sooner had this reached the
Dorians' ears, but they set fire to the temple: and all the rest making a shift to escape, Hellotis and Eurytione perished in the flames. Upon this
ensued a dreadful plague, which proved very fatal to the Dorians: and the
remedy prescribed by the goddess was to appease the ghosts of the two deceased sisters; whereupon they instituted this festival in memory of them, and erected a temple to Minerva, surnamed from one of them , Hellotis.

A festival of the same name was also observed in Crete, where it was usual for the servants to sit down at the table , whilst their masters stood
by and waited :1 which custom was also practised at the Roman saturnalia. Another of Mercury's festivals was observed by boys in the schools of
exercise at Athens ; at which no adult persons were allowed to be present,
besides the gymnasiarch ; wio, if convicted of having admitted any, under went the same punishment with those that corrupted freeborn youth : the occasion of this law seems to have been the foul and not-to -be-named lust
and wantonness which were practised in former times at this solemnity. ' Erricia , solemn sacrifices to Vesta,3 called in Greek 'Erria , of which
it was unlawful to carry away, or ' communicate , any part to any besides the worshippers ; whence 'Errią Júliv, to sacrifice to Vesta , is proverbially applied to such as do any thing in private, without spectators ;4 or rather to covetous misers, that will not part with any thing they are once pos sessed of.5
Ευμενίδεια , ο Σέμνων Εορτή, to the Furies,6 who were by the Athenians
called Espevceà Isaì, venerable goddesses ; by the Sicyonians, and others, Ejusvídes, favourable or propitious ; out of an opinion that their true names were unlucky omens. This festival was observed once every year
with sacrifices, wherein pregnant ewes, cakes made by the most eminent
of the young men, and a libation of honey and wine , were offered to the goddesses, the worshippers being decked with flowers. At Athens, none had admission to these solemnities but freeborn denizens ; and of them ,
those only that were of known virtue and integrity, for such alone could be acceptable to these deities, whose peculiar office it was to revenge and punish all sorts of wickedness. Eyqudsávos, to Ceres.?

were two processions to the goddess' temple without the city ; one by the
men in armour ; another, in which Juno's priestess, who was always a matron of the first quality, was drawn in a chariot by white oxen : from her priesthood the Argians accounted their years, as the Athenians did by the government of their archons. Being arrived at the temple , they offered a hecatomb of oxen , whence this festival is named 'Exaróxßoice; that sacri
fice is also sometimes called Aszégree which name may, perhaps, be de
rived from aéxos, a bed, because it was Juno's care to preside over mar- ;' riages, births, & c . There were also certain games , wherein the victory consisted in pulling down a shield that was strongly fixed upon the thea tre : the reward was a crown of myrtle, and a brazen shield ; whence the
game was sometimes called Xá meios kywy, the brazen contention . See 'Εκατόμβοια . Another festival of this name we find celebrated every fifth year in
Elis, where sixteen matrons were appointed to weave a garment for the goddess. There were games also, which are said to have been first insti
tuted by Hippodamia, in honour of Juno, by whose assistance she was married to Pelops. The presidents were sixteen matrons, every one of
whom was attended by a maid : the contenders were virgins, who being distinguished into several classes, according to their ages, ran races in their order, beginning from the youngest.

The Thisbians also, and Thebans in Boeotia, observed a solemn festival in honour of Hercules, surnamed Mhawy, because the uñña, apples, were
offered to him.3 The origin of which custom was thus : it being usual in former times to offer a sheep at this solemnity, it happened once that
the river Asopus had so far overflowed its banks, that it could not be forded, whereby the coming of the victim was hindered. The word

uñaon is ambiguous in Greek, signifying sometimes a sheep , sometimes an apple ; which some of the boys being aware of, for want of other em
ployment, performed the holy rites in sport, offering, instead of the ram , an apple, which they supported with four sticks, in imitation of feet, placing two more upon the top of it, to branch out like horns: Hercules was
mightily taken with the jest, and the custom was continued from that time
to my author's age, who flourished under Commodus the Roman emperor . At Sicyon, Hercules was honoured with a festival, which lasted two
days, the former of which was called 'Ovouéras, the latter 'Hgáxassa . At Lindus, there was a solemnity in honour of Hercules, at which no thing was heard but execrations and ill-boding words, insomuch that if any
person happened to let fall a lucky speech, he was thought to have pro
faned the holy rites; the origin of which custom is accounted for by Lactantius .
There was another festival of Hercules at Coos, wherein the priest officiated with a mitre on his head, and in women's apparel.
Hoopárbesc, a Peloponnesian festival, wherein the women met together and gathered flowers, as the name imports, being derived from fag, the spring, and cybos, a flower.
Heoxic , a festival mentioned by Hesychius. "Howis, a festival celebrated every ninth year by the Delphians, in hon our of some heroine, as may be learned from the name. ? There were in
it a great many mysterious rites, one of which was a representation of something like Semele's resurrection . 'Honorsíc, an Athenian festival in honour of " Hpalotos, Vulcan . At
this time there was a race with torches, called 'Ayàs acuradoüxos, in the academy; the manner of which was thus :3 the antagonists were three young men, one of whom being appointed by lots to take his turn first,
took a lighted torch in his hand, and began his course : if the torch was extinguished before he arrived at his journey's end, he delivered it to the
second, and he in like manner to the third. The victory was his that
carried the torch lighted to the race's end, who was called Acuradnpógos, or Iluponpogos; but if none could perform that, the victory was not adjudged to any of them . If any of the contenders, for fear of extinguishing the torch by too violent a motion, slackened his course, the spectators used to strike him with the palms of their hands; for which reason those blows
were called Πληγαι πλατείαι, broad stripes , as also Κεραμεικαι , because
they were inflicted in the Ceramicus,4 of which the academy was a part. To the successive delivering of the torches from one to another, there are frequent allusions in authors, who usually compare it to the turns and vicissitudes of human affairs, and the various changes and successions that
happen in the world ; of which I will only mention one instance out of Lucretius : 5

Θαλύσια, a sacrifice offered by the husbandmen after harvest, υπέρ της
süasics Two sagrāv, in gratitude to the gods, by whose blessing they en joyed the fruits of the ground. The whole festival was called ' Alwa : as
also Συγκομιστήρια , από της συγκομιδής των καρπών, from the gathering of fruits. Some will have it to be observed in honour of Ceres and Bacchus,
as these were the two deities who had a peculiar care of the fruits of the
earth . But Eustathius tells us, that there was also a solemn procession at this time in honour of Neptune : and adds further, that all the gods had
a share in the offerings at this festival; as appears also from Homer's own words, who tells us, that Diana's anger against Eneus was caused by his neglect of sacrificing to her at this festival, wherein all the rest of the gods had been feasted by him :
Και γάρ τoίσι κακόν χρυσόθρονος 'Αρτεμις ώρσε The silver Cynthia bade contention rise, Χωσαμίνη ότ' οί ούτι θολύσια γουνα αλωής In vengeance of neglected sacrifice : Oινεύς ριζ', άλλον οι θεοί δαινύνθ' εκατόμβας , On neus' field she sent a monstrous boar, Οι δ' ουκ έβρεξε Διός κοόρη μεγάλοιο, That levelled harvests and whole forests tore.

Bagynasa , an Athenian festival in honour of the Sun, and his attend
ants the Hours; or, as others think, of Delian Apollo and Diana. It
was celebrated upon the sixth and seventh days of Thargelion , and received its name from Jagynaed, which is a general word for all the fruits of the earth, because one of the chief ceremonies was the carrying about their
first fruits in pots called Jagynãou, which name was also applied to the Eipsowyces, which were carried about the city at this time, and shall be described in the festival called Iluavifon . The chief solemnity was upon
the latter day, the former being wholly taken up in making preparations for it ; at which time it was customary to lustrate the city, which was done
by two persons, called by the general name of vaquaxoi,4 which is applied to all that purified cities ; or the more peculiar one of Eupefaxyou. They were both men , or, according to others, a man and woman ; one of which represented the male, the other the female sex, and offered a sacrifice for
each of them : it was usual for the man to carry about his neck figs, called iszádes, of a blackish colour, and the woman white.5
Poetical fiction tells us, that the Þaquaròs was so called from one Phar macus, that stole some of the consecrated vessels of Apollo, and being ap prehended in the fact by Achilles' soldiers, suffered death ; of which crime

The Φαρμακός was called Κρατησίτης, from a sort of figs called κράδαι , and used in lustrations; whence also apádns yóuos was a tune upon the

queror to dedicate a tripos in the Pytheum , a temple of Apollo, built by Pisistratuś. At this festival the Athenians enrolled their adopted sons in the public register, as they did their natural at Apaturia. During the solemnity , it was unlawful to give or receive pledges ; and offe of

But the Athenians observed this festival with the greatest show of de votion : the worshippers were freeborn women ( it being unlawful for any of servile condition to be present), whose husbands were wont to defray
the charges of the solemnity ; and were obliged to do so, if their wives’ portion amounted to three talents. These women were assisted by a
priest called Eriparopógos , because his head was adorned with a crown whilst he executed his office ; as also by certain virgins, who were strictly
confined, and kept under severe discipline, being maintained at the public
charge in a place called Oso popogcior . The women were clad in white apparel, to intimate their spotless innocence, and were obliged to the
strictest chastity for five or three days before, and during the whole time of the solemnity, which lasted four days; for which end they used to strew upon their beds such herbs as were thought to destroy all appetite to venereal pleasures ; such were agnus castus, fleabane, and, which were made use of by the Milesian women, vine branches, &c . It was held
unlawful to eat the kernels of pomegranates, or to adorn themselves with
garlands; every thing being carried on with the greatest appearance of seriousness and gravity, and nothing tolerated that bore the least show of
wantonness and immodesty, or even of mirth and jollity, the custom of jesting upon one another excepted , which was constantly done in memory
of lambe, that by a taunting jest extorted a smile from Ceres, when she
was in a pensive and melancholy humour. Three days at least were spent in making preparations for the festival. Upon the eleventh of Pyanep sion, the women, carrying books upon their heads, wherein the laws were
contained , in memory, of Ceres ' invention , went to Eleusis, where the
solemnity was kept ; whence this day was called " Avodos, the ascent. Upon the fourteenth the festival began , and lasted till the seventeenth. Upon
the sixteenth they kept a fast, sitting upon the ground, in token of humi
liation ; whence the day was called Nootsiu , a fast. It was usual at this solemnity to pray to Ceres, Proserpine, Pluto, and Calligenia : this Calli
genia some will have to have been Ceres' nurse, others her priestess, others her waiting-maid ; and some there are who make her the same with
Ceres; but these seem to be sufficiently refuted by the testimony of Aris tophanes, who mentions her as distinct from the goddess ." And this
custom was omitted by the Eretrians alone of all the Grecians. There

called Znuice, a mulct, which was offered as an expiation of any irregulari
ties which happened during the solemnity. At the beginning of this fes tival, all prisoners committed to jail for smaller faults, that is, such as did
not make them incapable of communicating in the sacrifices, and other parts of divine worship, were released.1
Onosid , an Athenian festival in memory of Theseus : it was celebrated upon the eighth of every month, because he was the reputed son of Nep
tune, to whom those days were held sacred ; or because in his first journey from Troezen he arrived at Athens upon the eighth of Hecatombæon ; or in memory of his safe return from Crete,” which happened upon the eighth of Pyanepsion ; for which reason the festival was observed with greater solemnity upon that day than at other times. Some also there are
that will have it to have been first instituted in memory of Theseus' unit ing the Athenians into one body, who before lay dispersed in little hamlets
up and down in Attica. It was celebrated with sports and games, with mirth and banquets ; and such as were poor, and unable to contribute to them, were entertained upon free cost at the public tables. The sacrifices
were called 'Ozdódic, from "Ozdoos, the eighth, as being offered upon the eighth day of the month.4

In the time of Xerxes' invasion, when the Laconians durst not show their heads

at this festival are thus described by Pausanias: At the approach of the
festival, they made an ascent to the altar, heaping up soft earth in the manner of stairs; round the altar they placed , in order, pieces of green
wood, every one of which was in length sixteen cubits; upon it was laid
the driest wood they could get. The solemnity lasted two days ; on the former of which there was a solemn procession, followed by Diana's priestess, who was a virgin , and rode in a chariot drawn by bucks. On
the day following, they assembled to offer sacrifices, which consisted of
birds, bears, bucks, lions, wolves, with all sorts of animals, and garden
fruits, which were cast upon the altar, in part by private persons, and partly at the public charge ; then the fire being kindled, it sometimes happened that the wild beasts, having their fetters loosed by the flames, leaped off the altar, which fell out when my author was present ; yet nei

Auraid , an Arcadian festival, resembling the Roman Lupercalia ; it was celebrated with games, in which the conqueror was rewarded with a suit of brazen armour. A human sacrifice was offered at this time, It
was first observed by Lycaon , in honour of Jupiter, surnamed Lycæus, either from Lycaon's own name, or the Arcadian mountain Lycæus, which the Arcadians pretended was the true Olympus, whence they called it isgày xogupiny, the sacred hill, because Jupiter was feigned to have had his education there ; in memory of which there was an altar, where a certain mysterious worship was paid to that god, and a plot of ground consecrated to him, upon which it was unlawful for any person to set his feet.
Aúxrid , a festival held at Argos to Apollo Aúxulos. This name, as also that other Auxoztóvos, was derived from his delivering the Argives
from (aúxou) wolves, which wasted their country. In memory of which benefit they dedicated a temple to Apollo Lyceus, and called one of their
public fora, 'Ayopà lúxsios, the Lycean forum . Several other reasons are assigned, why the fore-mentioned names were given to Apollo ; as, that

rion, which was a winter month, to Jupiter Maspecéxons, to induce him to send mild and temperate weather, because he was usually taken for the
air, or heavens, and therefore thought to preside over the seasons. There are various reasons assigned for this surname; for paipárons is by Harpo
cration expounded ενθουσιώδης και ταρακτικός, outrageous and furious ; being derived from peripecorsiv, which is, according to Suidas, nãousīobar, Kuustevobas, to trouble or raise commotions. But Hesychius affixes a quite different signification to it ; for, according to him, fecipáxing is the same with usinxros, favourable and propitious : and herein Plutarch agrees with him , who tells us, that it was his opinion , that by the name
of Maspárons, which was given by the Athenians to the king of the gods, was meant Moiríxios . Neither of these significations are at all disagree able to the design of this festival; for since it was to procure good weather, it might either be instituted as a means to appease the deity , who was thought to cause storms and intemperate seasons; or, to entreat the same
person , as being of a mild and gentle disposition, and willing to grant the requests of his votaries.

solemnity they offered certain cakes called aupopārtes, which name is derived útò pou de pe pipásıv, from shining on every side, either because lighted torches hung round them when they were carried into the temple, or because they were offered at full moon , that being the time of this fes tival ; for it was instituted in honour of Diana, who was reputed to be the same with the moon , because it was full moon when Themistocles over threw the Persian fleet at Salamis.

Νουμήνια , Or Νεομήνια , afestival observed at the beginning of every lunar month , which was, as the name imports, upon the new moon , in honour
of all the gods, but especially of Apollo, who was called Nsoušvios, because the sun is the first author of all light; and whatever distinction of times
and seasons may be taken from other planets, yet they are all owing to him, as the origin and fountain of all those borrowed rays, which the rest have only by participation from him. To observe this festival was called
νουμηνιάζειν, certain cakes offered therein νουμηνιον, and the worshippers YouLmViaTTaí. It was observed with games, and public entertainments,
which were made by the richer sort, to whose tables the poor flocked in great numbers. The Athenians, at these times, offered solemn prayers and sacrifices for the prosperity of their commonwealth the ensuing month ,
in Erechtheus' temple in the citadel, which was kept by a dragon, to which
they gave , as was usual also in Trophonius' cave, a honey cake called PENITTCŪTA . Neither were the gods only worshipped at this solemnity, but also the demigods and heroes. Plutarch relates, that the Greeks, on
their new moons, first worshipped (9800s) the gods, afterwards (ñ wees nai cuilcoves) the heroes and dæmons. These sacrifices, because they were offered every month, were called 'ipepenuce ispà , or iriuúvio , and those that
performed them επιμήνιοι, as also άγρεμόνες.
Ezxboxa , a Macedonian festival, so called because it was observed in the month Xanthus, which, as Suidas tells us, was the same with April. At this time the army was purified by a solemn lustration , the manner of which was thus: they divided a bitch into two halves, one of which , to gether with the entrails, was placed upon the right hand, the other upon the left ; between these the army marched in this order : after the arms of the Macedonian kings, came the first part of the army, consisting, I sup pose , of horse ; these were followed by the king and his children, after
whom went the life - guards ; then followed the rest of the army. This

Οσχοφόρια , or' Ωσχοφόρια, an Athenian festival, so called από του φέρειν Tàs ooxas, from carrying boughs hung with grapes, which were termed őoxaci. The institution and manner of it are described thus by Plutarch in the life of Theseus. When they drew near to Attica, both Theseus
and the pilot were so transported with joy, that they forgot to hoist the sail which was to be the signal to Ægeus of their safety, who, therefore, in
despair, threw himself from the rock, and was dashed to pieces. Theseus disembarked, and performed those sacrifices to the gods, which he had
vowed at Phalerum, when he set sail, and sent a herald to the city , with an account of his safe return . The messenger met with numbers lament
ing the fate of the king, and others rejoicing, as it was natural to expect, at the return of Theseus, welcoming him with the greatest kindness, and
ready to crown him with flowers for his good news. He received the chaplets, and twined them round his herald's staff. Returning to the sea shore, and finding that These had not yet finished his libations, he
stopped without, not choosing to disturb the sacrifice. When the libations were over, he announced the death of Ægeus. Upon this, they hastened , with sorrow , and tumultuous lamentations, to the city. Hence, they tell
us, it is, that, in the 'Ooxopógic, or feast of boughs, to this day the herald is not crowned , but his staff ; and those that are present at the libations
cry out, ceaeū , ioù, ioù. The former is the exclamation of haste and tri umph, and the latter of trouble and confusion. It is probable that these are the oσχοφορικά μέλη, which are mentioned by Proclus.5
A little after, my author proceeds thus : “ The feast called 'Orx opézia , which the Athenians still celebrate, was then first instituted by Theseus.
For he did not take with him all the virgins upon whom the lot had fallen , but selected two young men of his acquaintance who had feminine and

These by warm bathing, and keeping them out of the sun, by providing unguents for their hair and complexions, and every thing necessary for
their dress, by forming their voice, their manner , and their step, he so effectually altered , that they passed among the virgins designed for Crete,
and no one could discern the difference. At his return he walked in pro cession with the same young men, dressed in the manner of those who now carry the branches . These are carried in honour of Bacchus and
Ariadne, on account of the story before related ; or rather because they l'eturned at the time of gathering ripe fruits. The Autrápogos, women who carry the provisions, bear a part in the solemnity , and have a share in the sacrifice, to represent the mothers of those upon whom the lots fell,
who brought their children provisions for the voyage. Fables and tales are the chief discourse, because the women then told their children stories
to comfort them and keep up their spirits. These particulars are taken from the history of Demon. ' Besides the rites already described , out of Plutarch, there was always a race at this festival: the contenders were
young men, elected out of every tribe, whose parents were both living. They ran from Bacchus' temple to that of Minerva Sciras, in the Phale.

There were two solemnities of this name, one of which was called Mirúra Ilavadørere , the great Panathenæa, and was celebrated once in five years, beginning upon the 22d of Hecatombæon . The other was

called Moupà Ilavabývæva , the lesser Panathenæa, and was kept every third year ; or rather, as some think , every year, beginning upon the 20th or
21st of Thargelion. In the latter, there were three games managed by ten presidents, who were elected out of the ten tribes of Athens, and who
continued in office four years. On the first day, at even , there was a l race with torches, in which, first, footmen , and afterwards horsemen, con
tended : the same custom was observed in the greater festival. The
second contention was svavogías dywv, a gymnical exercise, so called, be cause in it the combatants gave proof of their strength, or manhood. The place of these games was near the river, and was called from this festival
Tayconeixòy: the stadium , being decayed by time, was rebuilt of white Pentelic marble by Herodes, a native of Athens, with such splendour and
magnificence, that the most stately theatres could not compare with it. The last was a musical contention , first instituted by Pericles. In the songs used at this time, they rehearsed the generous undertakings of Har
modius and Aristogiton, who opposed the tyranny of Pisistratus' sons; and of Thrasybulus, who delivered the Athenians from the thirty tyrants imposed on them by the Lacedæmoniuns. The first that obtained the
victory, by playing upon the harp, was Phrynis, a Mitylenæan . Other musical instruments were also made use of, especially flutes, on which they
played in concert: there was also a dance performed by a circular chorus, of which hereafter: and the poets contended in four plays, of which the last was a satire ; and altogether were named from their number, ostece dogíce. Besides these, there was a contention at Sunium in imitation of a sea -fight. The conqueror in any of these games was rewarded with a
vessel of oil, which he was permitted to dispose of in whatever manner he pleased, whereas it was unlawful for any other person to transport that
commodity: he also received a crown of those olives which grew in the groves of Academus, and were sacred to Minerva, and called pogías, from
pogos, death , in remembrance of the misfortune of Halirrhothius, the son of Neptune, who, in a rage at his father's defeat by Minerva, in their contention about the name of Athens, when he attempted to cut down the olive -tree, by the production of which Minerva obtained the victory, missed his aim, and gave himself a fatal blow ; others derive the name from pégos, a part, because, according to some, these olives were given by contribution ; all persons that possessed olive - trees being obliged to contribute their proportions towards the celebration of this festival. Be
sides these, there was a certain dance called pyrrhichia , performed by young boys in armour, in imitation of Minerva, who, in triumph over the vanquished sons of Titan, danced in that manner . It was usual also,
when Athens was brought under the dominion of the Romans, for gladia tors to contend after the Roman fashion . No man was permitted to be
present at any of these games in dyed garments ; and the punishment of such offenders was left to the discretion of the 'Aywoléans, or president of

the games. Lastly, they offered a sumptuous sacrifice, towards which every one of the Athenian boroughs contributed an ox ; and of the flesh that remained , a public entertainment was made for the whole assembly. In the greater festival, most of the same rites and ceremonies were
observed, but with greater splendour and magnificence, and with the addi tion of some others, not observed in the lesser, as particularly the proces
sion, in which Minerva's sacred zítäds, or garment, was carried . This
tíndos was woven by a select number of virgins, called 'Eygaoríxes, from foyov, work ; these were superintended by two of the 'Apónpogos, and en tered upon their employment at the festival Xanxeia , which was upon the
30th day of Pyanepsion : it was of a white colour, without sleeves, and embroidered with gold ; upon it were described the achievements of Mi nerva, especially those against the giants: Jupiter also, and the heroes, with all such as were famous for valiant and noble exploits, had their effi gies in it ; whence men of true courage and bravery are said to be öğını Títhou, worthy to be portrayed in Minerva's sacred garment . With
this withos they made a solemn procession ; the ceremonies of which were thus: in the Ceramicus, without the city, there was an engine built in the form of a ship, on purpose for this solemnity ; upon this the astos
was hung in the manner of a sail ; and the whole was conveyed, not by the beasts, as some have imagined , but by subterraneous machines, to the temple of Ceres Eleusinia, and from thence to the citadel, where ther's
Thos was put upon Minerva’s statue, which seems to have been laid upon a bed strewed with, or rather composed of, flowers, and called Taxis. This procession was made by persons of all ages, sexes, and qualities. It was led up by old men, together, as some say , with old women , carrying olive -branches in their hands ; whence they are called farnopógor, bearers
of green boughs ; after these came the men of full age, with shields and spears, being attended by the Métoixo, or sojourners, who carried little
boats, as a token of their being foreigners, and were upon that account called Exconpógos, boat - bearers ; then followed the women , attended by
the sojourners' wives, who were named 'Tdqia mógov, from bearing water pots. These were followed by young men , singing hymns to the goddess; they were crowned with millet : next to these came select virgins of the
first quality , called Kampógor, basket-bearers, because they carried certain baskets, which contained some necessaries for the celebration of holy rites, which, as also other utensils required at the solemnity, were in the custody of one who, because he was chief manager of the public pomps, proces
sions, or embassies to the gods, was called 'Agxit'ewgos, and were distri buted by him as occasion required ; these virgins were attended by the
sojourners' daughters, who carried umbrellas and little seats, whence they were called Alpenpógos, seat- carriers ; lastly, it is probable that the boys bore up the rear: they walked in a sort of coats worn at processions,
and called Novoa usxo . The necessaries for this, as for all other pro

cessions, were prepared in a public hall, erected for that use, between the Piræan gate and Ceres? temple ; and the management and care of
the whole business belonged to the Novo úrarss, which name denotes officers appointed to see that the laws, ancient rites, and customs, be observed. It was further usual at this solemnity , to make a jail
delivery, to present golden crowns to such as had done any remarkable service for the com monwealth, and to appoint men to sing some of Homer's poems; which custom was first intro
duced by Hipparchus, the son of Pisistratus, Lastly, in the sacrifices at this, and other quin quennial solemnities, it was customary to pray
for the prosperity of the Platæans, on account of the signal service they had done the Athenians at the battle of Marathon, wherein they behaved themselves with extraordinary courage and resolution . Ilaváreia , in honour of Panace.1

acceptable to Neptune.9

Pan had likewise a festival in Arcadia ,2 the country he was believed most to frequent and delight in , at which they used to beat his statue with orials, sea onions : the same was done when they missed of their prey in hunting, in anger, as it should seem, at the god, whom they reputed to be president of that sport. Farther, it was customary to offer a scanty sacrifice, the relics of which
were not sufficient to entertain those that were present ; because , perhaps, they thought the god had frustrated their hopes of prey in hunting : on the contrary , when they had good success, they were more liberal in paying honours to him.3

Icvoavsíc , a festival, in which were solemn games, wherein only free born Spartans contended ; also, an oration in praise of Pausanias, the Spar tan general, under whose conduct the Grecians overcame Mardonius, in the famous battle at Platæa .
TIehorsie , a festival held by the Eleans to Pelops, whom that nation
honoured more than any other hero. It was kept in imitation of Hercu les, who sacrificed to Pelops in a treneh, as was usually done to the manes and infernal gods. We are informed that the magistrates of the Eleans sacrificed every year a ram in the same manner ; that the priest had no
share in the victim ; and that none of the Eleans, or other worshippers, were permitted to eat any part of it." Whoever ventured to transgress this rule was excluded from Jupiter's temple. Only the neck was allotted to one of Jupiter's officers, who was called Guaeùs, from his office, which was to provide the customary wood for sacrifices,'it being held unlawful in
that country to employ any other tree than the asúrm, or white poplar, to
that
use
.
IIeawgía, a Thessalian festival, not unlike the Roman Saturnalia. It is thus described by Atlienæus :4 . Baton , the Sinopensian rhetorician , in his description of Thessaly and Hæmonia, declares that the Saturnalia are a
Grecian festival, and called by the Thessalians Peloria ; his words are these : “ On a time when the Pelasgians were offering public sacrifices,
one Pelorus came in , and told one of them , that the mountains of Tempe in Hæmonia were torn asunder by an earthquake ; and the lake, which
had before covered the adjacent valley, making its way through the breach , and falling into the stream of Peneus, had left behind a vast, pleasant, and
delightful plain. The Pelasgians hugged Pelorus for his news, and in
vited him to an entertainment, where he was treated with all sorts of dainties : the rest of the Pelasgians also brought the best provisions they
had, and presented them to him ; and his landlord, with others of the best
quality, waited on him by turns. In commemoration of this, when the Pelasgians had seated themselves in the newly-discovered country, they
instituted a festival, in which they offered sacrifices to Jupiter, surnamed Pelor, and made sumptuous entertainments, to which they invited not
only all the foreigners amongst them, but prisoners also, whom they per mitted to sit down, and waited upon them . This festival is to this day
observed with great solemnity by the Thessalians, and is called IIsacopic ." ? IlsgirrétEld , a Macedonian solemnity.5 Περιφαλλία, the same with Φαλλαγώγια , being derived from φαλλός , of which see more in Διονύσια .. litové twv & ogt ), gymnical exercises at Pitana.6

11 uvrhpia , a festival in honour of Aglauros, the daughter of Cecrops, or rather of Minerva, who received from that lady the name of Aglauros.' At this time they undressed Minerva's statue, and washed it ; whence the
solemnity was called hurrágice, from riúviv, to wash. It was accounted an unfortunate or inauspicious day ; and therefore the temples, as upon all
such days, were surrounded with ropes, so that no man could have admis
sion ; the reason of which custom, with a farther account of this solemnity, we have in Plutarch's Alcibiades : “ The festival of the raurtúgia , or puri
fying of the goddess Minerva, was celebrated on the twenty -fifth of May,
when the pasuegridad perform those ceremonies which are not to be re vealed , disrobing the image and covering it up. Hence it is that the Athenians, of all days, reckon this the most unlucky, and take the most care not to do business upon it. Alcibiades' return from exile kappening on this day, it seemed that the goddess did not receive him graciously , but rather with aversion, since she hid her face from
him . Notwithstanding all this, every thing succeeded according to his wish . Farther, it was customary at this festival to bear in procession a clustre of figs, which was called ' Hystopie, or 'Hyúrgia , from óriouces,
to lead the way , because fgs were ηγεμόνες του καθάρου βίου, leaders to humanity, and a civil course of life ; for, when men left off their ancient
and barbarous diet of acorns, the next thing they used for food was figs. Ilonísic , a solemnity at Thebes,” in honour of Apollo, surnamed Iloroos,
grey, because he was represented in this city, contrary to the practice of all other places, with grey hairs . The victim was a bull ; but when it happened once that no bull could be procured , an ox was taken from the cart, and sacrificed : whence the custom of killing labouring oxen , which ,
till that time, was looked on as a capital crime, first commenced . Πομπέων δαίμονος εορτή, a festival mentioned by Hesychius . There was
an image at this solemnity called by a peculiar name Στεμματιαίον. Ποσείδια, or Ποσειδώνια , in honour of Ποσειδών, Neptune, to whom also they offered a solemn sacrifice, called 'Oveíacov,3

funeral of his father, paid his vows to Apollo upon the seventh of Pyanep sion ; for on that day, the youths that returned with him safe from Crete
made their entry into the city. They say, also, that the custom of boil ing pulse was derived from hence ; because the young men that escaped put all that was left of their provision together, and boiling it in one common pot, feasted themselves with it, and with great rejoicing ate
all together. Hence also they carry about an olive branch, bound about with wool , such as they then made use of in their supplications, which was called Eicsorávn, from sigos, wool, and crowned with all sorts of firsi

Though some are of opinion that this custom is retained in memory of the Heraclidæ, who were thus entertained , and brought up by the Athenians: yet the former account is more generally received. It may be added far ther, that the Eigcoiávn, when it was carried about in honour of Apollo, was of laurel; when of Minerva, of olive : because those trees were be .
lieved to be most acceptable to these deities : when the solemnity was ended , it was customary for them to erect it before their house-doors,

instituted by the Grecians, but derived to them from the barbarians (such were the Thracians reputed) , amongst whom, Suidas tells us, oubá Elv was the same with svázev, to shout svoi, as was usual in the festival of

Exsica , Ariga , or Exigopógre, an anniversary solemnity at Athens,4 upon the twelfth day of Scirrophorion , in honour of Minerva, or as some say , of Ceres and Proserpine . The name is derived from Sciras, a borough be

va, surnamed Sciras from that place ; or from one Scirus, an inhabitant of
Eleusis; or from Sciron of Salamis ; or from origos, chalk or white plaster , of which the statue dedicated to Minerva by Theseus, when he returned
from Crete was composed : or from origos, an umbrella , which was at this time carried in procession by Erechtheus' priest , or some of the sacred family of Butas, who, to distinguish them from others that made false
pretensions to that kindred, were called 'Etsoßovrádas, the genuine off spring of Butas ; those that ordered this procession were wont to make use of Aròs xudice, the skins of beasts sacrificed to Jupiter, surnamed Mu
rigoros, and Krusios, of which titles I have spoken before. Farther, there
was at the festival a race called 'Ooxopógia , because the young men that contended therein did Qipalv tàs comas, carry in their hands rine-branches full of grapes. Exregà, or Extégoce, at Alea, in Arcadia ,5 in honour of Bacchus, whose
image was exposed to tñ ozvadi, under an umbrella ; whence it is pro hable the name of this festival was derived. At this time the women were
beaten with scourges, in the same manner with the Spartan boys at the altar of Diana Orthia , which they underwent in obedience to a command
of the Delphian oracle.

danced, and were called Kogubanaíospsas; others exposed themselves in antic and ridiculous postures, and were named Kupitto . They had like
wise a public entertainment at this and some other times, which was
called xoris, and to partake of it, xori sıy. The manner of it was thus: tents being erected near the temple, and beds furnished therein , and
covered with tapestry , all the guests, as well foreigners as natives of Laco nia, were invited to supper, where every man had his portion allotted him , together with a small loaf of bread, called Quoinuados, a piece of new cheese, part of the entrails of the victim, and, instead of sweetmeats, figs, beans, and green vetches.

Athenæus,4 who tells us it was kept at Samos. The chief ceremony con sisted in carrying Juno's image to the sea -shore, and offering cakes to it, and then restoring it to its former place ; which was done in commemo
ration of its being stolen by the Tyrrhenians, and , when their ships were detained in the harbour by an invisible force, exposed upon the shore.

' Tanívbio , an anniversary solemnity 5 at Amyclæ in Laconia, in the
month Hecatombæon , in memory of the beautiful youth Hyacinthus, with games in honour of Apollo. It is thus described by Athenæus:6 «· Poly crates reports in his Laconics, that the Laconians celebrate a festival
called Hyacinthia, three days together ; during first day, their grief for the death of Hyacinthus is so excessive, that they neither adorn them selves with crowns at their entertainments nor eat bread, but sweetmeats
only , and such like things: nor sing pæans in honour of the god , nor prac tise any of the customs that are usual at other sacrifices ; but having supped with gravity, and an orderly composedness, depart. Upon the second day, there is a variety of spectacles, frequented by a vast concourse of people. The boys, having their coats girt about them, play sometimes
upon the harp, sometimes upon the flute, sometimes strike at once upon all their strings, and sing hymns in honour of the god, Apollo, in anapæs tic numbers, and shrill acute sounds. Others pass across the theatre upon horses richly accoutred ; at the same time enter choirs of young men,
singing some of their own country songs, and, amongst them , persons appointed to dance according to the ancient form , to the flute, and vocal music. Of the virgins, some are ushered in, riding in chariots made of wood , covered at the top , and magnificently adorned ; others in race-cha
riots. The whole city is filled with joy at this time ; they offer multi tudes of victims, and entertain all their acquaintance and slaves ; and so
eager are they to be present at the games, that no man stays at home, but the city is left empty and desolate.'
' Biotina, at Argos," upon the sixteenth , or rather upon the new moon , of the month called by the Argives Hermeas. The chief ceremony was, that the men and women exchanged habits, in memory of the gener..
ous achievements of Telesilla, who, when Argos was besieged by Cleo menes, having collected a sufficient number of women, made a brave and
vigorous defence against the whole Spartan army.

called in Greek zbày, or from a damsel of that name, whom Ceres carria
from Argolis to Hermione, where she dedicated a temple to the goddess. The manner of this festival is thus described by Pausanias :1 .Ceres her self is named Chthonia, and under that title is honoured with a festival,
celebrated every summer in this method : a procession is led up by the
priests of the gods, and the magistrates that year in office, who are fol
lowed by a crowd of men and women ; the boys also make a solemn pro
cession in honour of the goddess, being in white apparel, and having upon their heads crowns composed of a flower, which is by them called Koue rávdo aos, but seems to be the same with hyacinth, as appears as well by
the bigness and colour as from the letters inscribed upon it, in memory of the untimely death of Hyacinthus. This procession is followed by persons that drag a heifer, untamed and newly taken from the herd , fast bound, the temple, where they let her loose ; which being done, the door -keepers, who till then had kept the temple gates open, make all fast, and four old women being left within, and armed with scythes, they pursue the heifer, and despatch her, as soon as they are able , by cutting her throat. Then
the doors being opened , certain appointed persons put a second heifer into the temple, afterwards a third, and then a fourth, all which the old women kill in the fore-mentioned manner ; and it is observable, that all fall on the same side.'
Xsrúna, in honour of Diana, surnamed Chitonia , from Chitone, a borough in Attica, where this festival was celebrated.2
Another festival of this name was celebrated at Syracuse , with songs
and dances proper to the day. 3 Xaosice, a festival celebrated at Athens upon the sixth of Thargelion ," with sports and mirth, sacrificing a ram to Ceres, worshipped in a temple in or near the acropolis of Athens, under the title of xaón,5 which name,
though Pausanias thought to bear a hidden and mystical sense , understood by none but the priests themselves, yet perhaps it may be derived from xãón, grass, because Ceres was goddess of the earth , and all the fruits
thereof; and is the same with the epithet of sürdoos, or fertile, which is applied to her by Sophocles :6

Lopeopéyide, a festival in honour of Bacchus 'nuovános, eater of raw flesh , of which I have spoken in the former part of this chapter. In this, as in the other festivals of Bacchus, frenzy and madness were counterfeited :
what was peculiar to it was, that the worshippers used to eat the entrails of goats, raw and bloody, in imitation of the god, to whom the surname
by which he was adorned at this solemnity was given for the like actions. 'hoaña, solemn sacrifices 2 of fruits, offered in spring, summer, autumn,

OF THE RELIGION OF GREECE . 411
(harge. Cicero reports, that a victory in the Olympic games was not much less honourable than a triumph at Rome. Happy was that man
thought who could but obtain a single victory : if any person merited re peated rewards, he was thought to have attained to the utmost felicity that human nature is capable of; but if he came off conqueror in all the exer cises, he was elevated above the condition of men, and his actions styled wonderful victories. Nor did their honours terminate in themselves, but
were extended to all about them ; the city that gave them birth and edu cation was esteemed more honourable and august ; happy were their rela tions, and thrice happy their parents . A Spartan ,4 meeting Diagoras, who had himself been crowned in the Olympic games, and had seen his sons and grandchildren victors, embraced him, and said, “ Die, Diagoras, for thou canst not be a god. By the laws of Solon, a hundred drachms
were allowed from the public treasury to every Athenian who obtained a prize in the Isthmian games ; and five hundred drachms to such as were victors in the Olympic, Afterwards, the latter of these had their main tenance in the prytaneum , or public hall of Athens. At the same place, it was forbidden by the laws to give slaves or harlots their names from any
of these games , which was accounted a dishonour to the solemnities.6
Hence there is a dispute in Athenæus, how it came to pass that Nemea, the minstrel, was so called from the Nemean games. Persons were appointed to take care that all things were performed according to custom, to decide controversies amongst the antagonists, and to adjudge the prizes to those that merited them : these were called
αισυμνήσαι, βραβευται, αγωνάρχαι, αγωνοδίκαι, αγωνοθέται, αθλοθέται, though betwixt these two Phavorinus makes a distinction, for abdod'stui, he tells us, was peculiar to gymnical exercises ; whereas the former was sometimes applied to musical contentions, They were likewise called
fußdoxy, and paBdovóueos, from púbaos , a rod or sceptre, which these
judges, and in general all kings and great magistrates, carried in their hands.

leaping, running, throwing, darting, and wrestling. Instead of darting some mention boxing, and others may speak of other exercises different from those which have been mentioned ; fornévraboy seems to have been
a common name for any five sorts of exercise performed at the same time. In all of them, there were some customs that deserve our observation .
Apópos, the exercise of running, was in great esteem amongst the ancient Greeks, insomuch that such as prepared themselves for it thought it worth their while to use means to burn or parch their spleen , because
it was believed to be a hinderance to them, and retard them in their course. Homer tells us, that swiftness is one of the most excellent endowments
with which a man can be blessed. Indeed, all those exercises that con
duced to fit men for war were more especially valued . Now swiftness was looked upon as an excellent qualification in a warrior, both because it
serves for a sudden assault and onset, and likewise for a nimble retreat ; and therefore it is not surprising that the constant character which Homer
gives us of Achilles is, that he was pódus nnùs, or swift of foot ; and in the holy scriptures, David, in his poetical lamentation over those two
great captains, Saul and Jonathan, takes particular notice of this warlike
quality of theirs: • They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.' To return : the course was called otádrov, being of the same extent with
the measure of that name, which contains 125 paces ; the runners, oradiodgóuon. When the length of it was enlarged, it was named dóaszos,
and the contenders δολιχοδρόμοι ; whence the proverb Μη ζήτει έν σταδίων Són.xov, search not for a greater thing in a less. Suidas assigns twenty
four stadia to the dórixes, and others only twelve. The measure of it seems not to have been fixed or determined , but variable at pleasure. When they ran back again to the place whence they had first set out, the
course was called δίαυλος, and the runners , διαυλοδρόμοι, for αυλός was the old term for stadium . Sometimes they ran in armour, and were termed

men
or lead, called σφαίραι, and tlien it was termed σφαιρομαχία. At first their hands, and arms were naked and unguarded ; afterwards they were
surrounded with thongs of leather called cestus, which at first were short, reaching no higher than the wrists, but were afterwards enlarged, and carried up to the elbow, and sometimes as high as the shoulder : and in time they came to be used not only as defensive arms but to annoy the enemy, being filled with plummets of lead and iron, to add force to the
blows. The cestus was very ancient, being invented by Amycus king of the Bebrycians, who was contemporary with the Argonauts .? Those that prepared themselves for this exercise, used all possible means to render
themselves fat and fleshy, that so they might be better able to endure blows; whence corpulent men or women were usually called pugiles.2 Iléan, the exercise of wres tling, was sometimes called
xurusaytirn, because the com batants endeavoured to throw each other down, to do which
they called pñžas. At first they
contended only with strength of body, but Theseus invented
the art of wrestling, by which were enabled to throw
down those who were far supe rior to them in strength. In later ages, they never encoun tered till all their joints and members had been soundly
rubbed , fomented, and suppled with oil,whereby all strains were
prevented . The victory was adjudged to him that gave his
antagonist three falls ; whence opiážai and útotpočas signify to conquer ; ó τριάξας, οι αποτριάξας, and τριακτήρ, the conqueror , τριαχθήναι, or αποτρια eñvies, to be conquered ; and årgíaxtosőre, an insuperable evil : others make the proper signification of these words to belong only to victors in all the exer cises of the m'évtob2os ;4 however, the forementioned custom is sufficiently
attested by the epigram upon Milo, who, having challenged the whole assembly, and finding none that durst encounter him, claimed the crown ; but as he was going to receive it, unfortunately fell down : whereat the
people cried out that he had forfeited the prize ; then Milo, 'Ανστας δ' εν μέσσοισιν ανεκραγεν. Ουχί τρί έστιν Arose, and standing in the midst, thus cried : One single fall caninot the prize decide, And who is here can throw me t' other two ?
There were two kinds of wrestling, viz . one called 'Oglice cén, and

Oxborúan, which is that already described : and another called 'Avazasyon
tilan, because the combatants used voluntarily to throw themselves down , and continue the fight upon the ground, by pinching, biting, scratching,
and all manner of ways annoying their adversary; whereby it often came to pass, that the weaker combatant, and who would never have been able
to throw his antagonist, obtained the victory, and forced him to yield ; for
in this exercise, as in boxing also, the victory was never adjudged till one party had fairly yielded. This was sometimes done by words, and often
hy lifting up a finger, whence dextúrov úversivooder signifies to yield the victory ; for which reason, we are told by Plutarch, that the Lacedæmoni ans would not permit any of those exercises to be practised in their city,
wherein those that were conquered did dextúzov de versívcoles, confess themselves overcome by holding up their finger, because they thought it
would derogate from the temper and spirit of the Spartans to have any of them tamely yield to any adversary ; though that place has been hitherto mistaken by most interpreters. Martial has taken notice of this exercise:

former, it borrows the custom of throwing down ; from the latter, that of beating adversaries; for wrestlers never struck, nor did boxers ever attempt to throw down one another ; but the rayxatidorai were per
mitted to do both ; and it was customary for the weaker party, when he found himself sore pressed by his adversary, to fall down , and fight rolling on the ground , whence these combatants were called xudod tixoi, which

Besides the exercises already described, there were others of a quite dif ferent nature : in which musicians, poets, and artists contended for victory. Thus, in the 91st Olympiad Euripides and Xenocles contended who should
be accounted the best tragedian . On another occasion, Cleomenes re commended himself by repeating some collections of the verses of Empe docles, which he had compiled . At another time, Gorgias of Leontium ,
who invented the art of discoursing on any subject without premeditation , made a public offer to all the Greeks who were present at the solemnity,
to discourse extempore upon whatever argument any of them should pro pound. Lastly, to mention only one example , more, Herodotus is said to have gained very great applause, and to have fired young Thucydides with
an early emulation of him , by repeating his history at the Olympic games. "

CHAP. XXII .
OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES.
The Olympian games were so called from Olympian Jupiter, to whom they were dedicated, or from Olympia, a city in the territory of the Pisans; or, according to Stephanus, the same with Pisa. Their first in stitution is referred by some to Jupiter, after his victory over the
sons of Titan ;' at which time Mars is said to have been crowned for box
ing, and Apollo to have been superior to Mercury at running. Phlegon, the author of the Olympiads, reports that, they were first instituted by
Pisus, from whom the city Pisæ was named .
According to others, the first author of them was one of the Dactyli , named Hercules, not the son of Alcmena, but another of far greater anti quity, who with his four brethren, Pæoneus, Ida, Jasius, and Epimedes, left their ancient seat in Ida, a mountain of Crete, and settled in Elis, where he instituted this solemnity ; the original of which was only a race,
wherein the four younger brothers contending for diversion, the victor was crowned by Hercules with an olive garland, which was not composed of
the common olive branches, nor the natural product of that country , but brought by Hercules ( so fables will have it) from the Hyperborean Scythi
ans, and planted in the Pantheum ncar Olympia, where it flourished, though not after the manner of other olive trees, but spreading out its
boughs more like a myrtle: it was called xandooripavos, fit for crowns, and garlands given to victors in these games were always composed of it ;
and it was forbidden , under a great penalty, to cut it for any other use. These Dactyli were five in number, whence it is that the Olympian
games were celebrated once in five years, though others make them to be solemnized once in four; wherefore, according to the former, an Olympiad must consist of five, according to the latter, of four years : but neither of these accounts is exact; for this solemnity was held indeed every fifth
year, yet not after the term of five years was quite past, but every fiftieth month, which is the second month after the completion of four years ;3 and
as these games were celebrated every fifth year, so they lasted five days; for they began upon the eleventh , and ended upon the fifteenth day of the lunar month , when the moon was at the full.
Others report that these games were instituted by Pelops, in honour of Neptune, by whose assistance he had vanquished Enomaus, and married his daughter Hippodamia.
Others say, they were first celebrated by Hercules, the son of Alcmena, in honour of Pelops, from whom he was descended by the mother's side ;'

but being after that discontinued for some time, they were revived by Iphitus, or Iphiclus, one of the sons of Hercules.
The most common opinion is, that the Olympian games were first in stituted by this Hercules, in honour of Olympian Jupiter, out of the spoils
taken from Auges king of Elis, whom he had dethroned and plundered, when defrauded by him of the reward he had promised for cleansing his stables :1 Diodorus the Sicilian confirms this account, and adds, that Her
cules proposed no other reward to the victors but a crown, in memory of his own labours, all of which he accomplished for the benefit of mankind, without designing any reward to himself, besides the praise of doing well.
At this institution, it is reported that Hercules himself came off conqueror
in all the exercises except wrestling, to which when he had challenged all the field, and could find no man that could grapple with him, at length Jupiter, having assumed a human shape, entered the lists ; and when the
contention had remained doubtful for a considerable time, neither party
having the advantage, or being willing to submit, the god discovered him
self to his son , and from this action , got the surname of Ichabotins, the wrestler, by which he is known in Lycophron.3 All these stories are rejected by Strabo, in his description of Elis, where
he reports, that an Ætolian colony, together with some of Hercules' pos terity, subdued a great many of the Pisæan towns, and amongst them Olympia, when they first instituted, or at least revived , enlarged, and augmented these games, which, as my author thinks, could not have been omitted by Homer, who takes every opportunity to adorn his poems with
descriptions of such solemnities, had they been of any note before the Trojan war . Whatever becomes of the first author of the Olympian
games, it is certain they were either altogether discontinued or very little frequented , till the time of Iphitus, who was contemporary with Lycurgus
the Spartan lawgiver . He reinstituted this solemnity about four hundred
and eight years after the Trojan war, from which time, according to Solinus, the number of the Olympiads was reckoned. After this they were again neglected till the time of Choroebus, who, according to Phle gon's computation, lived in the 28th Olympiad after Iphitus, and who instituted again the Olympian games ; which , after this time, were con
stantly celebrated . And this really fell out in the 418th year after the
destruction of Troy, or two years sooner, by Eusebius' account, which reckons four hundred and six years from the taking of Troy to the first Olympiad, meaning that which was first in the common computation of
Olympiads, which was begun at this time.6

The care and management of these games belonged sometimes to the Pisæans, but, for the most part, to the Eleans, by whom the Pisæans were destroyed, and their very name extinguished. Polybius, in the fourth
book of his history, reports, that the Eleans, by the general consent of the Greeks, enjoyed their possessions without any molestation or fear of war
or violence in consideration of the Olympian games, which were there celebrated . And this he assigns as a reason why they chiefly delighted in
a country life, and did not flock together into towns like other states of Greece. Nevertheless we find, that the 104th Olympiad was celebrated by order of the Arcadians, by whom the Eleans were at that time reduced to a very low condition ; but this, and all those managed by the inhabi tants of Pisa, the Eleans called ' Avorujeriádes, Unlawful Olympiads, and Jeft out of their annals, wherein the names of the victors, and all occur
rences at these games, were recorded . Till the 50th Olympiad , a single
person superintended, but then two were appointed to perform that office . · In the 103d Olympiad that number was increased to twelve, according to the number of the Elean tribes, out of every one of which one president
was elected : but in the following Olympiad, the Eleans having suffered great losses by a war with the Arcadians, and being reduced to eight tribes, the presidents were also reduced to that number : in the 105th
Olympiad, they were increased to nine ; and , in the 106th to ten, which number continued till the reign of Adrian the Roman emperor. These persons were called 'Exaqvodíxas, and assembled together in a place named 'Elanvodırañon in the Elean forum , where they were obliged to reside ten months before the celebration of the games, to take care that such as offered themselves to contend, performed their tpourréopate, or pre
paratory exercises, and to be instructed in all the laws of the games, by certain men called Nopopúzczes, keepers of the laws : to prevent all unjust
practices, they were obliged to take an oath , that they would act impar tially, would receive no bribes, and would not discover the reason for which they disliked or approved of any of the contenders . At the solem
nity they sat naked, having the crown of victory before them till the exer
cises were finished , and then it was presented to whomsoever they adjudged it. Nevertheless there lay an appeal from the hellenodicæ to the Olym pian senate. Thus, when two of the hellenodicæ adjudged the prize to

All such as designed to contend, were obliged to repair to the public
gymnasium at Elis, ten months before the solemnity, where they prepared themselves by continual exercises: we are told, indeed , by Phavorinus,
that the preparatory exercises were only performed thirty days before the games; but this must be understood of the performance of the whole and
entire exercises in the same manner they were practised at the games, which seems to have been only enjoined in the last month , whereas the nine antecedent months were spent in more light and easy preparations.
No man that had omitted to present himself in this manner was allowed to
put in for any of the prizes ; nor were the accustomed rewards of victory given to such persons, if by any means they insinuated themselves, and
overcame their antagonist; nor would any apology , though seemingly ever so reasonable, serve to excuse their absence. In the 208th Olympiad,
Apollonius was rejected , and not suffered to contend , because he had not
presented himself in due time, though he was detained by contrary winds
in the islands called Cyclades ; and the crown was given to Heraclides without performing any exercise, because no just and duly qualified ad .. versary appeared to oppose him. No person that was himself a notorious criminal, or nearly related to any such, was permitted to contend . Farther,

to prevent underhand dealings, if any person was convicted of bribing his adversary, a severe fine was laid upon him ; nor was this alone thought a sufficient guard against evil and dishonourable contracts and unjust prac tices, but the contenders were obliged to swear they had spent ten whole months in preparatory exercises : and farther yet, both they, their fathers, and brethren , took a solemn oath, that they would not, by any sinister or
umlawful means, endeavour to stop the fair and just proceedings of the games.
The order of wrestlers was appointed by lots, in this manner : a silver urn , called xáamis, being placed, into it were put little pellets, in size
about the bigness of beans, upon every one of which was inscribed a letter,
and the same letter belonged to every pair ; now those whose fortune it was to have the same letters, wrestled together ; if the number of the
wrestlers was not even, he that happened to light upon the odd pellet
wrestled last of all with him that had the mastery ; wherefore he was called poedgos, as coming after the rest; this was accounted the most fortunate chance that could be, because the person that obtained it was to encounter one already wearied, and spent with conquering his former antagonist, himself being fresh , and in full strength .'

CHAP. XXIII .
OF THE PYTHIAN GAMES,
The Pythian games were celebrated near Delphi, and are by some thought
to have been first instituted by Amphictyon , the son of Deucalion, or by the council of amphictyones. Others refer the first institution of them to
Agamemnon ;' Pausanias ? to Diomedes, the son of Tydeus, who having escaped a dangerous tempest as he returned from Troy, dedicated a temple at Troezen to Apollo, surnamed 'Eroßarheos , and instituted the Pythian games to his honour : but the most common opinion, is, that Apollo him
self was the first author of them , when he had overcome Python, a ser pent, or cruel tyrant."
At their first institution, they were only celebrated once in nine years, but afterwards every fifth year, according to the number of the Parnassian nymphs that came to congratulate Apollo, and brought him presents after his victory.
The rewards were certain apples consecrated to Apollo, according to Ister, and the epigram Archias, already quoted , in he thus

Where Brodæus will have uñac to signify the Delphian laurel, which, he
tells us, brought forth berries streaked with red and green , and almost as
large as apples; but this interpretation is by no means genuine or natural, since the word piñaa is never used in that sense : however that be, it is eertain the victors were rewarded with garlands of laurel, as appears from
the express words of Pindar, who tells us that Aristcmenes was crowned
with roce IIcegizoic, or laurel that flourished upon mount Parnassus :1 whence some imagine that the reward was double, consisting both of the sacred apples and garlands of laurel. But at the first institution of these
games, the victors were crowned with garlands of palm , or, according to some, of beech leaves.2
It is said , that in the first Pythian solemnity, the gods contended , that
Castor obtained the victory by horse-races, Pollux at boxing, Calaïs at running, Zetes at fighting in armour, Peleus at throwing the discus, Te lamon at wrestling, Hercules in the Pancratium ; and that all of them were honoured by Apollo with crowns of laurel. But others again tell us,
that at first there was nothing but a musical contention, in which he who sung best the praises of Apollo obtained the prize, which at first was either
silver or gold, or something of value, but was afterwards changed into a
garland . Where the prize was money, the games were called dywyss úgo γυρίσαι ; where only a garland , αγώνες στεφανίται, φυλλίναι, &c. The
first that obtained victory by singing was Chrysothemis, a Cretan, by whom Apollo was purified after he had killed Python ; the next prize was
won by Philemon ; the next after that, by his son Thamyris. Orpheus having raised himself to a pitch of honour almost equal to the gods, by instructing the profane and ignorant world in all the mysteries of religion
and ceremonies of divine worship ; and Musæus, who took Orpheus for bis example, thought it too great a condescension , and inconsistent with the high characters they bore, to enter into the contention . Eleutherus
is reported to have gained a victory purely account of his voice, his song being the composition of another person : Hesiod was repulsed, be cause he could not play upon the harp, which all the candidates were obliged to do. There was also a set song, called IIulizós rómo;, to which a dance was
performed. It consisted of these five parts, in which the contest of Apollo and Python was represented : 1. 'Avengovors, which contained the prepara tion to the fight ; 2. "Autoripa , or the first essay towards it ; 3. Keters devonós, the action itself, and the god's exhortation to himself to stand out with courage ;. 4. " Iapboo nai dúxtuño, the insulting sarcasms of
Apollo over the vanquished Python ; 5. Zúginyes, in imitation of the ser pent's hissing as he expired under the blows of Apollo. Others make this song to consist of the six following parts: 1. Isīgue, the preparation ; 2.

Ilyßes, in which Apollo dared Python to engage him by reproaches: for izpeßiệsıy signifies to reproach , iambic verses being the common form of invectives; 3. AkxTuos, which was sung in honour of Bacchus, to whom
those numbers were thought most acceptable : this part belonged to him, because he had, as some say , a share in the Delphian oracle , or possessed it before Apollo ; 4. Kentixos, in honour of Jupiter, because he was Apollo's father, and thought to delight most in such feet, as being edu cated in Crete, where they were used ; 5. Mateñor, in honour of mother Earth, because the Delphian oracle belonged to her before it came into
Apollo's hand ; 6. Sugiyos, or the serpent's hissing. By others it is thus described :1 1. Titīga , an imitation of A pollo pre paring himself for the fight with all the circumspection of a prudent and
cautious warrior ; 2. Karaxsasvomès, a challenge given to the enemy ; 3. ’ ImpeBoxòs, a representation of the fight, during which the trumpets sound ed a point of war ; it was so called from iambic verses, which are the most proper to express passion and rage ; 4. Et ordeños , so called from the feet of
that name, or from orivdesv, to offer a libation , because it was the celebra
tion of victory ; after which it was always customary to return thanks to the gods, and offer sacrifices; 5. Karaxógsuois, a representation of Apollo's
dancing after his victory .? In the third year of the 48th Olympiad the Amphictyones, who were presidents of these games, introduced flutes, which till that time had not
been used at this solemnity ; the first that won the prize was Sacadas of Argos : but because they were more proper for funeral songs and lamen tations than the merry and jocund airs at festivals, they were in a short time laid aside. They added likewise all the gymnical exercises used in the Olympian games , and made a law , that none should contend in run
ning but boys. At or near the same time, they changed the prizes, which had before been of value, into crowns or
garlands ; and gave these games the name of Pythia, from Pythian Apollo, whereas, till that time, as some say, they had either an
other name, or no peculiar name at all. IIorse races also, or chariot-races, were introduced
about the time of Clisthenes, king of Argos, who obtained the first victory in them , riding in a chariot drawn by four horses; and several
other changes were, by degrees, made in
these games , with which I shall vot trouble you.

CIIAP. XXIV .
OF THE NENEAN GAMES .
THE Nemean games ? were so called from Nemea, a village, and grove, between the cities Cleona and Phlius, where they were celebrated every
third year, on the twelfth of the Corinthian month Ilávspos, sometimes
called 'Isgourvíce, which is the same with the Athenian Boëdromion . The exercises were chariot-races, and all the parts of the pentathlum . The presidents were elected from Corinth, Argos, and Cleonæ, and were dressed in black clothes, the habit of mourners, because these games were
a funereal solemnity, instituted in memory of Opheltes, who was also called Archemorus, from veggen , a beginning, and pogos , fate, or death, because Amphiaraus foretold his death soon after he began to live ; or,2 hecause that misfortune was a prelude to all the bad success that befell the
Theban champions ; for Archemorus was the son of Euphetes and Creusa, or of Lycurgus, a king of Nemea, or Thrace, and Eurydice, and was nursed by Hypsipyle, who, leaving the child in a meadow , whilst she went to show the besiegers of Thebes a fountain, at her return found him dead, and a serpent folded about his neck ; whence the fountain, before called Langia, was named Archemorus ; and the captains, to comfort
Hypsipyle for her loss, instituted these games.3
Others are of opinion , that these games were instituted by Hercules, after his victory over the Nemean lion, in honour of Jupiter, who had a magnificent temple at Nemea, where he was honoured with solemn games , in which men ran races in armour : but perhaps these might be distinct from the solemnity I am now speaking of. Lastly, others grant that they
were first instituted in memory of Archemorus, but allege that after being intermitted they were revived by Hercules, and consecrated to Jupiter. The victors were crowned with parsley, which was an herb used at
funerals, and fabled to have sprung from the blood of Archemorus: con cerning it, Plutarch 5 relates a remarkable story , with which it will not be improper to conclude this chapter . “ As Timoleon, ' says he, was ascend
ing a hill, at the top ofwhich the enemy's camp, and all their vast forces, would be in sight, he met some mules loaded with parsley ; and his men took it into their heads that it was a bad omen, because we usually crown
the sepulchres with parsley, and thence the proverb with respect to one that is dangerously ill , dtiolai osdívou, He has need of parsley. To deli
ver them from this superstition , and to remove the panic, Timoleon
ordered the troops to halt, and making a speech suitable to the occasion , observed, among other things, “ That crowns were brought them before

the victory, and offered themselves of their own accord." For the Corin
thians from all antiquity having looked upon a wreath of parsley as sacred , crowned the victors with it at the Isthmian games ; in Timoleon's time it was still in use at those games, as it is now at the Nemean, and it is
but lately that the pine-branch has taken its place . The general having addressed his army, as we have said, took a chaplet of parsley, and crowned himself with it first, and then his officers and the common sol diers did the same. '
CHAP . XXV .
OF THE ISTHMIAN GAMES.
The Isthmian games were so called from the place where they were cele brated, namely, the Corinthian Isthmus, a neck of land by which Peloponne sus is joined to the continent. They were instituted in honour of Palæmon
or Melicertes, the son of Athamas, king of Thebes, and Ino, who, for fear of her husband, who had killed her own son Learchus in a fit of madness,
cast herself, with Melicertes in her arms, into the sea, where they were received by Neptune into the number of the divinities of his train , out of
compliment to Bacchus, nursed by Ino. At the change of their condition they altered their names ; Ino was called Leucothea, and her son Pala
mon : however, Palæmon's divinity could not preserve his body from being tossed about the sea, till at length it was taken up by a dolphin , and car
ried to the Corinthian shore, where it was found by Sisyphus, at that time king of Corinth , who gave it an honourable interment, and instituted these funeral games to his memory. Others report, that Melicertes' body was
cast upon the Isthmus, and lay there some time unburied, whereupon a grievous pestilence began to rage in those parts, and the oracles gave out, that the only remedy for it was to inter the body with the usual solemni
ties, and celebrate games in memory of the boy : upon the performance of these commands the distemper ceased ; but afterwards, when the games
were neglected , broke out again ; and the oracles being consulted , gave answer that they must pay perpetual honours to the memory of Melicertes, which they did accordingly , erecting an altar to him, and enacting a law , for the perpetual celebration of these games.
Some report, that they were instituted by Theseus in honour of Nep tune ; others are of opinion, that there were two distinct solemnities observed in the Isthmus, one to Melicertes, and another to Neptune;
which report is grounded upon the authority of Musæus, who wrote a treatise about the Isthmian games. Phavorinus reports, that these garnes were first instituted in honour of Neptune, and afterwards celebrated in
lansani.

memory of Palæmon . Plutarch, on the contrary, tells us, tnat the first
institution of them was in honour of Melicertes, but that they were after wards altered, enlarged, and reinstituted to Neptune by Theseus : he gives also several other opinions concerning their origin : “ Theseus, ' says he, ‘ instituted games in imitation of Hercules, being ambitious, that as the Greeks, in pursuance of that hero's appointment, celebrated the Olym pic games in honour of Jupiter, so they should celebrate the Isthmian in
honour of Neptune: for the rites performed there before, in memory of
Melicertes, were observed in the night, and had more the air of mysteries
than of a public spectacle and assembly. But some say the Isthmian games were dedicated to Sciron , Theseus inclining to expiate his untimely fate, by reason of their being so nearly related ; for Sciron was the son of Canethus and Henioche, the daughter of Pittheus. Others will have it, that Sinnis was their son, and that to him, and not to Sciron , the games were dedicated . He made an agreement, too, with the Corinthians, that they should give the place of honour to the Athenians who came to the
Isthmian games, as far as the ground could be covered with the sail of the public ship that brought them , when stretched to its full extent. This
particular we learn from Hellanicus and Andron of Halicarnassus.'
The Eleans were the only nation of Greece that absented themselves from this solemnity, which they did for the following reason . The
Corinthians having appointed the Isthmian games, the sons of Actor came to the celebration of them, but were surprised and slain by Hercules, near
the city Cleone. The author of the murder was at first unknown ; but being at length discovered by the industry of Molione, the wife of Actor,
the Eleans went to Argos, and demanded satisfaction, because Hercules at that time dwelt at Tiryus, a village in the Argian territories. Being repulsed at Argos, they applied to the Corinthians, desiring of them that
all the inhabitants and subjects of Argos might be forbidden the Isthmian
games, as disturbers of the public peace ; but meeting with no better suc cess in this place than they had done at Argos, Molione forbade them to go to the Isthmian games, and denounced a dreadful execration against any of the Eleans that should ever be present at the celebration of them ; which command was so religiously observed, that none of the Eleans dare
venture to go to the Isthmian games to this day, says my author, lest Molione's curses should fall heavy upon them. These games ? were observed every third, or rather 'every fifth year , and held so sacred and inviolable, that when they had been intermitted
for some time, through the oppression and tyranny of Cypselus, king of Corinth , after the tyrant's death, the Corinthians, to renew the memory
of them , which was almost decayed , employed the utmost power and in dustry they were able in reviving them , and celebrated them with such
splendour and magnificence as was never practised in former ages. When Corinth was sacked and totally demolished by Mummius, the Poinan

general, these games were not discontinued ; but the care of them was
committed to the Sicyonians, till the rebuilding of Corinth , and then re
stored to the inhabitants of that city. The victors were rewarded with garlands of pine-leaves ; afterwards parsley was given them, which was also the reward of the New
mean conquerors, but with this difference, that
there it was fresh and green , whereas in the Isthmian games it was dry and withered .
Afterwards the use of parsley was ļeft off, and the pine- tree came again into request , which alterations Plutarch has accounted for in the
fifth book of his Symposiacs.2.
CHAP. XXVI .
OF THE GREEK YEAR,
The writers of ancient fables report, that Ougavàs, whom the Latins call Coelus, king of the Atlantic islands, was reputed the father of all the gods, and gave his name to the heavens, which from him, were by the Greeks
termed ougavàs, and by the Latins coelum, because he invented astrology, which was unknown till his time. Others ascribe the invention both of
astrology, and the whole córas o pasgıxòs, science of the celestial bodies, to Atlas: from him these discoveries were communicated to Hercules, who first imparted them to the Greeks. Whence the authors of fables took
occasion to report that both these heroes supported the heavens with their shoulders . The Cretans pretended that Hyperion first observed the mo tions of the sun, moon, and stars. He was son to the primitive god
Uranus, and from his knowledge of the celestial motions is sometimes taken by the poets and other fabulous authors for the father of the sun,
sometimes for the sun himself. The Arcadians reported, that their coun tryman Endymion first discovered the motion of the moon :o which gave ,
occasion to those early ages to feign that he was beloved by that goddess. Lastly, others report that Actis, by some called Actæus, who flourished
in the isle of Rhodes about the time of Cecrops, king of Athens, invented
the science of astrology , which he communicated to the Egyptians.? But to pass from fabulous to more authentic histories, the first improve .
ment and study of astronomy is generally ascribed to the Grecian colonies which inhabited Asia. And it is thought to have been first learned from

the Babylonians or Egyptians, and communicated to the Greeks either
by Thales of Miletus, Pythagoras of Samos, Anaximander of Miletus, Anaximenes the scholar and fellow - citizen of Anaximander, Cleostratus,
of Tenedos, Enopidas of Chios, or Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, the master of Pericles, who was the first that taught the Ionic philosophy at Athens,
where he opened his school in the same year that Xerxes invaded Greece.
Every one of these seems to have cultivated and improved this science, and on that account by different men to have been reputed the inventor , or first master of it in Greece. Before the time of these philosophers, it
is certain that the Greeks were entirely ignorant of the motions of the heavenly bodies ; insomuch that Thales first observed a solar eclipse in the fourth year of the 48th Olympiad. A long time after that, in the fourth year of the 90th Olympiad, an eclipse of the moon proved fatal to Nicias, the Athenian general, and the army under his command, chiefly because the reason of it was not understood.2 And Herodotus seems to have been
wholly unacquainted with this part of learning; whence he describes the solar eclipses after the poetical manner, by the disappearance of the sun , and his leaving his accustomed seat in the heaven ,3 never mentioning the moon's interposition .

But that the Grecians had then no settled form of years and months, wherein the solar and lunar revolutions were regularly fitted to each other, appears from what is reported concerning Thales the Milesian , that hav ing spent a considerable time in the observation of the celestial bodies,
and observing that the lunar revolution never exceeded thirty days, he
appointed twelve months of thirty days each, whereby the year was made to consist of 360 days. Then, in order to reduce these months to an agreement with the revolution of the sun, he intercalated thirty days at the end of every two years, of the above said months. Whence id tempus
TRIETngida appellabant, quod tertio quoque anno intercalabatur, quamvis biennii circuitus, et revera derneis esset : " that space of time was termed a period of three years, because the intercalation was not made til after
the expiration of full two years, though really it was only a period of two years ;' as we are informed by Censorinus. So that this period of two years contained no less than 750 days, and exceeded the same number of
years as measured by the true motion of the sun, twenty days; which dif ference is so very great, that Scaliger was of opinion this cycle was never
received in any town of Greece. Afterwards, Solon observing that the course of the moon was not finished in thirty days, as Thales had computed it, but in twenty-nine days and
half a day, he appointed that the months should , in their turns, consist of twenty -nine and of thirty days, so that a month of twenty -nine days should
constantly succeed one of thirty days; whereby an entire year of twelve months was reduced to 354 days, which fell short of the solar year , that is, the time of the sun's revolution , eleven days and one -fourth part of a day, or thereabouts. In order, therefore, to reconcile this difference, Tstguerngis, a cycle of four years, was invented. Herein , after the first
two years, they seem to have added an intercalated month of twenty -two days. And again , after the expiration of two years more, another month
was intercalated , which consisted of twenty -three days, the fourth part of one day in every year, arising to a whole day in a period of four years. And thus Solon prevented the lunar years from exceeding those which are
measured by the revolution of the sun, and so avoided the mistake so manifest iu the cycle of Thales. But afterwards it was considered , that the forty -five days added by Solon
to his period of four years, and containing a ( taugns) full lunar month and a half, would occasion the cycle to end in the midst of a lunar month ; to remedy which inconvenience , óxtasingis, a term of eight years was in
stituted instead of the former cycle of four years, to which three entire lunar months were added at several times.2
After the cycle of eight years, no change was made in the kalendar till the time of Meton, who, having observed that the motions of the sun and inoon fell short of one another by some hours, which disagreement, through

at first scarcely perceivable, would quite invert the seasons in the compass of a few ages, invented a cycle of nineteen years, termed švaraidsrustn
pis, in which term the sun having finished nineteen periods, and the moon 235, both returned to the same place of the heavens in which they had
been nineteen years before. Afterwards it was observed , that in the revolution of every cycle, the moon outwent the sun about seven hours. To prevent this inconveni ence , Calippus contrived a new cycle, which contained four of Meton's,
that is, seventy -six years. And upon the observation of some small dis
agreement between the sun and moon at the end of this term, Hipparchus devised another cycle, which contained four of those instituted by Calip
pus. According to other accounts, one of Meton's cycles contained eight insaxaideXustngides, j. e. 152 years. This was afterwards divided into
two equal parts, and from each part one day, which was found to be super Auous in Meton's cycle, was taken away ."
From the Grecian years let us now proceed to their months. In the computation of these, they seem neither to have agreed with other nations, nor amongst themselves. In the authors of those times we find different
months often set against, and made to answer one another : and learned men have hitherto in vain attempted to reconcile these contradictions. Plutarch , in his life of Romulus, owns, that no agreement was to be found between the Grecian and Roman new moons : and in the life of Aristides,
discoursing of the day upon which the Persians were vanquished at Pla tæa, he professes, that even in his own time, when the celestial motions
were far better understood than they had been in former ages, the begin nings of their months could not be adjusted. These disagreements seem
to have been occasioned by some of these, or the like causes :
1. That the years of different nations were not begun at the same time. The Roman January , which was the first month , fell in the depth of win ter, The Arabians and others began their year in the spring. The Macedonians reckoned Dius, their first month, from the autumnal equinox .
The ancient Athenian year began after the winter solstice ; the more modern Athenians computed their years from the first new moon after the summer solstice. Hence those men will be exceedingly mistaken , who
made the Roman January to answer the Attic Gamelion, or the Macedo nian Dius, which are the first months of those nations ; or that measure the primitive Attic year by that which was used after the time of Meton .
2. That the number of months was not the same in all places. The Romans had at first only ten months, the last of which was for that reason
termed December. Afterwards they were increased to twelve by Numa Pompilius. The Egyptians had at first only one month, which was after wards divided into four, according to the seasons of the year: some of barbarous nations divided their year into three months. The same num
1 Conf. Henr. Dodwelii librun de Anne Veieri Græcorum , 2 Conf. Simplicius in lib. 1. Physicæ Aris: otelis.



432 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
ber of the months was received by the ancient Arcadians. Afterwards
the Arcadians parted their year into four months; the Acarnanians reckoned six months to their year ; but most of the Greeks of latter ages,
when the science of astronomy had been brought to some perfection, gave twelve months to every year, besides those which were intercalated to
adjust the solar and lunar periods.
3. That the months were not constantly of the same length . Some contained thirty days, others a different number. Some nations computed their months by the lunar motions, others by the motion of the sun . The
Athenians, and ra.Toto tūv vũ ‘Examvidãy rówv, most of the present Grecian cities, says Galen, make use of lunar months : but the Macedonians and all the agxaño, ancient Greeks, or, as some rather choose to read , Adicevoi, the Asiatics, with many other nations, measure their months by the motion of the sun . 4. That the months of the same nations, partly through their ignorance
of the celestial motions, and partly by reason of the intercalated days, weeks, and months, did not constantly maintain the same places, but hap
pened at very different seasons of the year.
However that be, the Athenians, whose year is chiefly followed by the ancient authors, after their kalendar was reformed by Meton, began their year upon the first new moon after the summer solstice2 Hence the fol lowing verses of Festus Avienus :
Sed primera Meton exordia sumsit ab anno, Torreret rutilo Phæbus cum sidere Cancrum .
Their year was divided into twelve months, which contained thirty and twenty -nine days alternately, so as the months of thirty days always went
before those of twenty -nine. The months which contained thirty days were
termed raugais, full, and dixapdovoi, as ending upon the tenth day : those which consisted of twenty - nine days were called xoãos, hollow , and from their concluding upon the ninth day, évnapdovo.s
Every month was divided into mpíu dexthusga , three decades of days. The first was μηνός άρχομένου, οι ισταμένου. The second, μηνός μεσούντος . The third , μηνός φθίνοντος, παυομένου, or λήγοντος.

decade was φθίνοντος δεκάτη: the second φθίνοντος εννάτη» the third φθίνοντος bydón. and so forward to the last day of the month, which was termed
önuntgids, from Demetrius Poliorcetes. Before the time of Demetrius, it was called by Solon's order, ovn sai véd, the old and new ; because the new moon fell out on some part of that day ; whereby it came to pass, that
the former part belonged to the old moon, the latter to the new .. The same was also named opiáras, the thirtieth ; and that not only in the months which consisted of thirty days, but in the rest of twenty -nine: for
in these , according to some accounts, the twenty -second day was omitted ; according to others, the twenty -ninth.” But which day soever was
omitted in the computation, the thirtieth was constantly retained. Hence, according to Thales' first scheme, all the months were called months of
thirty days, though, by Solon's regulation , half of them contained only twenty -nine ; and the lunar year of Athens was called a year of three hundred and sixty days; though really , after the time of Solon , it con sisted of no more than three hundred and fifty- four days. Whence the Athenians erected three hundred and sixty of Demetrius the Phalerean's
statues, designing for every day in the year one ; as we are informed by Pliny,* and the following verses cited by Nonius from Varro's Hebdo mades :

Quot lucis habet annus absolutus. The names and order of the Athenian months were these which folloir.
1. Εκατομβαιών, which was πλήρης, οι δηκαφθινός , a month of thirty days. It began upon the first new moon after the summer solstice, and
so corresponded to the latter part of the Roman June, and the first part of July. The name was derived από του πλείστας εκατόμβας θύεσθαι τω
remvi robtw, from the great number of hecatombs which were usually sacri
ficed in this month . But the ancient name was Kpóvios, or Kpoviwy, which was derived from Kgóvia, the festival of Cronus or Saturn, which was kept in this month . The days of this month, which may serve as a pattern
for the rest, were thus computed : 1. Νουμηνία, ισταμένου , οι αρχο 10. Ισταμένου δεκάτη.

ARCHÆOLOGIA GRÆCA ;
OR, THE
ANTIQUITIES OF GREECE .
BOOK II . - CHAP. I.
OF THE WARS, VALOUR, MILITARY GLORY, &c. OF THE ANCIENT GRECIANS.
The ancient Grecians were a rude and unpolished race of mortals, wholly
unacquainted with the modern, and more refined arts of war and peace. Persons of the highest birth and quality, and whom they fancied to be descended from the race of the immortal gods, had little other business to employ their hours, besides tilling the earth, or feeding their flocks and herds; and the rapine of these, or some other petty concerns, which was looked on as a generous and heroic exploit, occasioned most of the wars
80 famous in their story. Thus Achilles, in Homer, tells Agamemnon ,
that it was purely to oblige him he had engaged himself in so long and so dangerous a war against the Trojans, from whom he had never received any just cause of quarrel, having never been despoiled of his oxen or
horses, or had the fruits of his ground destroyed by them. '
And the simplicity of their conduct may be sufficiently evinced , as from several other instances, so by those especially where Achilles, Hector, or
Ajax, are introduced opposing themselves to vast numbers, and, by the force of their own valour, putting to flight whole squadrons of their ene
mies. Nor is the poet to be thought blameworthy, or to have transgressed the rules of probability in such relations : which though perhaps strange
and incredible in our days, were no doubt, accommodated to the manners of the times of which he wrote. For even in sacred history, we find it recorded , that a single Goliah defied all the armies of Israel,2 and with
a big look , and a few arrogant words struck so great a terror into them , that they fled before him .
Notwithstanding this, in the revolution of a few ages, Greece became the celebrated mother of the bravest and most experienced soldiers in the
world . For being cantoned into a great number of little independent states, all of which , though bordering upon one another, were governed by different laws, and prosecuted contrary interests, it became the seat of continual wars ; every hamlet being ambitious of enlarging its territory, by encroaching upon its neighbour- village, and contending for the addition

of a few lands, with no less heat and fury than if whole kingdoms had been the prize. The consequence whereof was, that the Grecians being from
their childhood inured to martial affairs, and having to their native bravery added long and constant experience, were rendered , as well in good order and discipline, as true courage and valour, superior to most other nations. They became a terror to all the countries round about them , and with small numbers often put to flight vast multitudes of the barbarians ; the Persians frequently experienced the sad effects of it in the loss of numerous armies, and at length of the greatest empire in the world . And, to
enumerate no more instances in a thing so well known , the Carthaginians, though men of great courage, and excellently skilled in the art of war, being worsted in Sicily by Timoleon the Corinthian, in several encounters, and by unequal numbers of men , were driven into an admiration of the
Grecian valour, and forced to confess, that they were the most pugnacious and insupportable of mankind , and forthwith made it their business to
entertain as many of them as they could procure , in their service, But though almost all the Grecians had their share in military glory,
yet were the rest far inferior to the Lacedæmonians, who, by the laws of
their country , were under an obligation to make war their profession ; they never applied themselves to any art or employment, or the exercise of
trades, which they accounted unworthy of generous and freeborn souls ; but committing all such cares to the Helots, who were a genteeler sort of
slaves, spent their time in manly exercises, to render their bodies strong and active. They were also accustomed by hard diet, by stripes, and
other severities, patiently to undergo hardships, to endure wounds, to encounter dangers, and , if the honour of their country so required, to throw themselves into the arms of death without fear or regret. Yet were
they not so imprudent or foolhardy, as to court dangers or death ;

Or life ; both these the strictest virtue tried, They died, but not as lavish of their blood, And, as that call'd , they gladly liv'd or died.
Nor was this indifference to life or death only discoursed of amongst
them as a point of mere speculation , but carefully and seriously instilled in their tender years, and always embraced as one of the first principles of their actions; which begot in them such an undaunted courage, and so firm and unmoveable a resolution that scarce any other nation was able to stand before them. This extraordinary and unparalleled bravery, being
adorned and strengthened by the wisest conduct, and the most perfect skill in all the stratagems of war those times wero capable of, has rendered
them famous in story, and examples of military virtue to all succeeding ages : " For, ' (these are Plutarch's words),3 the Lacedæmonians were

most expert and cunning in the art of war, being trained up and accus tomed to nothing more than to keep themselves from confusion, when their order should be broken ; to follow any leader, or right-hand man , so
rallying themselves into order, and to fight on what part soever dangers press.'
It is therefore by no means to be wondered at, that foreign and vastly remote nations should be desirous to entertain the Lacedamonians in their
service ; that Cyrus the Younger should think it the readiest and most effectual method to advance himself to the empire of Persia ; that Croesus, the wealthy king of Lydia, and several of the Egyptian monarchs, though surrounded with numerous forces of their own, should never esteem them
selves secure without assistance from Sparta ; or that the Sicilians, Thra cians, Carthaginians, with the Cyreneans, and many others, were beholden
to it for protection, and deliverance from powerful enemies. And for the Grecians themselves, whenever any of their little states were in danger of being swallowed up by their more powerful neighbours, we find them
having recourse for aid to the Spartans, who were a common refuge to the oppressed, and restrained the ambitious invaders of other men's rights.
Hence, likewise, it came to pass, that in all confederacies they were
looked on as the principal associates ; and in all wars carried on by public contributions, they challenged the chief command as their right and pecu liar. Nor could any exigency prevail with them to depart from that
claim, or resign it to the greatest of princes. Gelon , king of Sicily, though promising to furnish them with large supplies against the barbari
ans, on condition that he should be declared captain - general of the Grecian forces, was rejected . Yet we find, that after the victory over Mardonius
at Platæa, Pausanias, the Lacedæmonian general, having, by his excessive severity, and tyrannical behaviour to the rest of the soldiers, rendered the Spartans very odious, in the end they revolted to the Athenians, the gentle and courteous carriage of whose commanders , Aristides and Cimon , had endeared them to all the rest of the Grecians ; and here the magnaņi
mity of the Lacedæmonians was wonderful; for when they perceived that their generals were corrupted, and their minds too much elevated and
puffed up by the greatness of their authority, they left off sending any more of them to the wars, choosing rather to have citizens of moderation, and that persevered in their ancient manners and customs, than to be honoured
with the superiority of all Greece . But this misfortune did not put an end to the Lacedæmonian greatness ; for we find them in a little timu re -assuming their ancient spirits, and disdaining even Alexander himself for their superior, though submitted to by the rest of the Grecians, and de
clared their general against Persia : which is the reason , that in the monu ments erected after the Persian victories, and bearing the names of Alexa

But the Lacedæmonians were not long able to maintain this command ;
for the Athenians having recruited their naval forces, and engaged Eva goras the king of Cyprus, and Pharnabasus the Persian emperor's lieuten
ant, to their interest, by their assistance, and the singular conduct of their own admiral, Conon, gave the Spartans so great an overthrow at Cnidus,*
that they never after pretended to contest the sovereignty of the seas, but contented themselves with the chief command at land, which the Athenians
suffered them to enjoy, without further molestation , both cities being weary of the contention, and convinced at length of the truth of what had been commonly observed , that fortune was most favourable to the Lace dæmonians by land, but in sea engagements sided with the Athenians,5
This seems not to have been without reason ; the Athenians, through the commodiousness of their situation, being disposed, and, as it were, invited hy nature to apply themselves to naval affairs; whereas the Lacedæmonians were placed at a greater distance from the sea, and more inclined to land
service (to which they were inured from their tender years), than to ven ture themselves on the ocean , to which they had never been accustomed ; for Lycurgus, their lawgiver, expressly forbade them to visit foreign

countries, 1 out of a well-grounded fear, lest his citizens should be corrupted by the conversation of strangers, and forsake that excellent platform of government he contrived forthem . And it happened to them as he had
wisely foreseen ; for no sooner had Lysander rendered them sovereigns of the seas, but they began by degrees to leave off' their ancient customs, and
to degenerate from the virtue and glory of their ancestors.?
CHAP. II .
OF THE LEVIES, PAY, &c. OF SOLDIERS.
THE Grecian armies consisted , for the most part, of free denizens, whom
the laws of their country obliged, when arrived at a certain age, to appear in arms, upon the summons of the magistrate , or commissioned officer .
I:: some places they were more early admitted to the wars, in others later.
The Athenians, when arrived at eighteen years of age, were appointed to guard the city, with the forts belonging to it : from their going about to
visit which , they were called megírodos ;8 but were not sent to foreign wars till twenty ; the Spartans seldom till thirty. The younger men in both
cities, with those who, by reason of their age, were discharged from mili tary service, were left at home to defend their habitations.
Some persons were excused by reason of their age ; for, having spent
their youth and strength in serving their country, it was but reasonable to discharge them from farther service, that they might end their days in
peace. After threescore years, it seems to have been usual in most places
to allow them the liberty of retiring. At Athens, no man above forty was pressed to serve in the wars, except in times of extreme danger.* Others
were exempt on account of their functions ; such were, at Athens, o tiños Apreusvoi, the farmers of the public customs, whose presence was required in the city during the whole time of their employment, and several of the holy orders, as also the persons appointed to dance at Bacchus' festival.“
Others were excluded from serving in the wars ; such were the slaves, and such others as lived amongst them, but were not honoured with the freedom of their cities . These were never admitted except in cases of extreme danger, when there remained no other means of preserving the commonwealth . Of this custom I have already given a large account in one of the foregoing books.”
All that served were entered into a public roll ; whence the levy was
called καταγραφή, κατάλογος, στρατολογία ; and to make a levy, κατάλο

γον, οι καταγραφής ποιείσθαι . Amongst the primitive Grecians, it seems
to have been frequently made by lots, every family being obliged to furnish out a certain number, and filling up their proportion by the chance of lots:
whence Mercury, in Homer, ' pretending to be one of the sons of Polyctor the Myrmidon , adds, that he was appointed by lot to follow Achilles to the Trojan war : Τών, μεταπαλλόμενος, κλήμα λάχον ενθάδ' έπεσθαι. 'Twas I, who, when the lots were drawn ,
Was
doom'd
to
follow
Peleus
'
mighty
son
.
For
the
appointment
of
all
persons
of
a
certain
age
to
be
ready
to
serve
in
the
wars
,
seems
only
to
be
an
institution
of
latter
ages
:
whereas
all
such
like
things
were
formerly
managed
at
the
pleasure
of
the
supreme
magis
trate
.
The soldiers were all maintained at their own expenses ; no name was
more opprobrious than that of a mercenary, it being looked upon as a dis grace for any person of ingenuous birth and education to serve for wages.
For all this, it was not permitted any person to absent himself, except upon reasons allowed by the law ; and whoever was found thus to have
transgressed, was at Athens deprived of his voice in all public business,
and in a manner, of all other rights of citizens, and was forbidden to enter
into any of the public temples . And lest any of the persons appointed to serve should make their escape, we find they were branded with certain marks, called oriyuata. These are mentioned by Vegetius,: who, speak ing of the military oath , and the muster-roll, wherein the soldiers' names were registered , mentions also, that they were victuris in cute punctis scripti, ' branded with lasting marks in their flesh .' These marks com
monly contained the name or proper ensign of their general. To dis
tinguish soldiers from slaves, who were commonly marked in the forehead, as has been elsewhere observed, they had oriyyata tu sais xspoi, their
characters impressed upon their hands, as we are informed by Ælian , By the same ceremony, it was customary for men to dedicate themselves to
certain deities. Whence is that question mentioned in Zechariah ," where he speaks of the prophets and votaries of the pagan gods : “ And one shall say unto him , what are these wounds in thy hands? ' And the beast who l'equires all men to worship him in the book of Revelation , ' is there said
to ' cause all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to re ceive a mark in their right hands, or in their foreheads. And to the same custom St Paul is thought to allude, in his Epistle to the Galatians,? where, speaking of the wounds he had received in his Christian warfare,
he tells us, that he bore in his body the origuata , or marks, of the Lord Jesus.
The Carians were the first that served in Greece for pay ,s and have therehy rendered their names infamous to posterity, being represented by

all the writers of those times as a base and servile nation : insomuch that
tapixo, and rapiuongos, are proverbial epithets for persons of abject and pusillanimous tempers, or servile condition ;' and Kãgss is a synonymous term for slaves, as in that proclamation at the end of the Athenian festival
Anthesteria, whereby the slaves were commanded to be gone out of doors :
θύραζε, Κάρες , ουκ έτ' 'Ανθεστήρια. Begone, ye slaves, the Anthesteria are ended .
Thus the Carians were reproached for introducing a custom , which, in a few ages after, was so far from being looked upon as unworthy their birth
or education, that we find it practised by the whole nation of the Greeks,
who not only received pay for serving their own commonwealth , but listed themselves under foreign kings, and fought their battles for hire ; their chief magistrates not disdaining to accompany them in such expeditions. Several instances of this might be produced, were not that famous one of
the great Agesilaus' condescending to serve Ptolemy, king of Egypt, in stead of many
others.
The
first
that
introduced
the
custom
of
paying
soldiers
at
Athens
was
Pericles
,
who
,
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
commonalty
,
represented
how
unreasonable
it
was
,
that
men
of
small
estates
,
and
scarce
able
to
provide
for
their
families
,
should
be
obliged
to
neglect
their
business
,
and
spend
what
their
industry
had
laid
up
,
in
the
public
service
;
and
thereupon
pre
ferred
a
decree
,
that
all
of
them
should
have
subsistence
-money
out
of
the
exchequer
;
2
which
seems
to
have
been
received
with
general
applause
.
What
sum
they
daily
received
cannot
be
easily
determined
,
it
being
in
creased
or
diminished
as
occasion
required
.
At
first
we
find
the
foot
soldiers
had
two
oboli
a
-day
,
which
in
a
month
amounted
to
ten
drachms
,

What
we
read
in

of
the
soldiers
that

one
of
whom
was
allotted
a
drachm
a

day
,
with
another
to
a
servant
for
attending
upon
him
,
must
not
be
understood
as
if
their
ordinary
pay
was
of
that
value
,
that
being
only
to
the
common
seamen
of
Athens

those
that
manned

Titpwbónov

is
a
proverbial
expression
for
a
soldier's
life
;
5
and
Tetpwborígev
,
for
serving
in
the
war
.
The
horsemen's
pay
was
for
the
most
part
thirty
drachms
a
-month
,
that
is
,
a
drachm
a

day
;
this
we
find
to
have
been
termed
natúor
Cois.6
The ordinary method of raising this money, was by imposing a tax on the whole commonwealth, whereby all persons were obliged to contribute according to the value of their estates . But this was done only when the
public treasury was exhausted, and the constant revenues from tributary cities, public lands, woods, mines, or from fines and amercements, were
not sufficient to defray the charges of the war. In cases of great necessity, the richer citizens at were obliged to extraordinary contributions ;
and there appears to have been a generous and laudable emulation amongst
I Hesychius.

the men of quality in that city, who voluntarily offered more than was required of them , and contended which of them should most largely con tribute towards the honour and preservation of their native country. Confederate wars were maintained at the common charge of all the
allies, every one being obliged to send a proportion of men, as we find practised in the Trojan war, which was the first wherein the whole
country of Greece united against a foreign enemy. Sometimes they were carried on by public contributions of money, levied by persons delegated by the common consent of the confederates, which was only the practice
of later ages ; the primitive wars, wherein the soldiers served at their own expense, and supplied their necessities out of the spoils of their enemies, being managed with less charge to the public. The first tax, or tribute, of this nature , that we find paid by the Grecians, was after the expulsion of Xerxes out of Greece, when they agreed to make an invasion upon
their common enemy, under the conduct of the Athenians ; for then Aris tides , the Athenian , at the general desire of the Greeks, surveyed the whole country and revenue, and assessed all particular persons , town by
town , according to every man's ability. Thus he taxed them four hun dred talents, to which Pericles added about a third part more ; for we find
in Thucydides, that in the beginning of the Peloponnesian war the Athe nians had coming in from their confederates six hundred talents . After Pericles' death, being increased by little and little, it was at length raised to the sum of thirteen hundred talents ;' all which was managed at the discretion of the Athenians.

OF
THE
DIFFERENT
SORTS
OF
SOLDIERS
.
The
armies
were
composed
of
various
sorts
of
soldiers
:
their
gro's
or
main
body
usually
consisted
of
footmen
;
the
rest
rode
,
some
in
chariois
,
some
on
horseback
,
others
upon
elephants
.
The
foot

soldiers
we
find
distinguished
into
three
sorts
;
the
first
and
principal
of
which
were
termed
'
Orhite
,
being
such
as
bore
heavy
armour
,
engaging
with
broad
shields
and
long
spears.

therefore,

he

It seems to have been frequent for them , having shot their arrows, to re tire behind the shields of the heavy -armed for protection,
3. Ils TaoTA ,” though frequently comprehended under the fooi, as opposed to the owaitas, were a middle sort between both, being armed with
shields and spears, but far inferior in bigness to those of the heavy - armed men. The name is taken from their narrow shields, called réatu .
The horsemen amongst the ancient Grecians were not very numerous, being only such as were possessed of estates, and able to furnish out horses
at their own charge. Hence, both at Athens and Sparta, we find innsis, or horsemen , to have composed the second order in the commonwealth ,
being placed above the commonalty, and next to those of the highest qua lity and fortune: the same is recorded of the Roman equites, and, to
mention no more, we are told by Herodotus,3 that among the Chalcidians, none but rich men were admitted into that order. Afterwards, when men
of estates began to court ease and pleasure, and thought it more advisable to furnish out a horseman , and maintain him at their proper expenses, than to venture their own persons, they retained indeed their former name, but the honour of serving on horseback was lost.4 Who it was that first instructed mankind in the art of horsemanship, is not agreed by the ancient writers of fables ; some attribute it to the Ama
zous, others to the Centaurs,6 others to Bellerophon ,” others, lastly, to trouble you with no more, ascribe the honour of it to Neptune,8 the first
creator of this animal; for which reason we find the various epithets,
°177105,9 “ ITFuqxos,10 ' Iranyéons, 12 'IFFoxúgros , &c. conferred upon him by the poets and mythologists.
Whoever obliged mankind with the first invention of this art, seems to
have left it very imperfect; for in those early ages it is probable they un derstood not the method of governing horses with reins and bits, but managed them only with a rope or switch, and the accent of their voice ;
this we find to have been the practice of several other nations, as the Numidians, 12 Getulians,13 Lybians,14 and Massylians.15 Afterwards bridles came into fashion , of which the most remarkable
were those called lupata, having bits of iron, not unlike wolves ' teeth, and therefore called in Greek aúxos, in Latin lupi . The first invention of
them is by Statius attributed to Neptune ; by others to the Lapithæ , or Centaurs, who inhabited a town in Thessaly, called Pelethronium : thus Virgil, 17 Fræna Peletkronii Lapithæ , gyrosque dedere The Pelethronian Lapitha first rode Impositi dorso. With bridles, and the circling curvet showd of the gay courser, mounted on his back .
Though some are of opinion that the poet speaks of bridles, as invented not by the Lapithæ , but by a man of that nation , whose name was Pele

thronius, to whom we find Pliny also attributing the invention of bridles and harness : 1 the last of these the Greeks term opguata , and içixtix, which were made of various sorts of stuffs, as leather, cloth , or the skins of
wild beasts. Parthenopæus' horse is covered with the skin of a lynx in Statius ; Æneas' in Virgil, with a lion's ; quem fulva leonis Covered with lion's skin .

Sometimes we find them adorned with rich and costly clothing.3
Of the saddles in use amongst us we find no mention in ancient writers;
nor of the stapia , or more properly subex peduneus, or stirrup, which does not appear to have been used till these latter ages ; there being no notice taken of any such thing in any author, that I know of, before Eustathius,
who flourished five hundred years ago, and in his commentaries upon Homer, hath mentioned an instrument of this sort. In former ages they supplied the want of such helps by their art or agility of body ; being able to leap on horseback ;" or, for their greater convenience, the horses were taught submissively to bow their bodies to the ground, and receive their
riders upon their backs, ' as we find practised as well in Greece as by the ancient Spaniards,6 and other nations.?
Sometimes we find them leaping up by the help of their spears, or other things. Several other methods were used by men of weak and inactive bodies: some getting up on the backs of their slaves ;& others by the help
of short ladders; both which supports were termed å vußodsīs. Lastly, we find the highways filled with stones erected for this purpose ; which is said
to have been done in Italy by Gracchus, and in Greece was always one part of the business of the overseers of the roads.10
It is disputed whether the warriors of primitive ages were carried to the field in chariots or on horseback , Lucretius indeed tells us, that the first
heroes were mounted upon horses, and that chariots were only a later in vention . But we are informed by Palæphatus that chariots were first in use ; the Lapithæ , who flourished about the time of Hercules, being the
first that attempted to ride upon horses, a thing strange and unheard of by the Grecians in those days, who viewed them not without amazement, imagining them to be monsters compounded of the different shapes of men and horses, or bulls, which they frequently backed instead of horses: whence
we have the fables of the Centaurs and Hippocentaurs. And it is more
than probable, that at the time of the Trojan war the custom of riding and fighting upon horses was not commonly received by the Grecians; since
the heroes of Homer, whose authority must in such cases ever be held sacred, are always introduced into the battle in chariots, never on horse back .
The chariots of princes and heroes were not only contrived for service,

Πίπτανται.
And the poet calls that of Achilles άρματα ευ πεπυκασμένα.3
The chariots in Homer are drawn , for the most part, by two horses coupled together ; that of Achilles had no more, the names of his horses being only Xanthus and Balius. To these two was sometimes added a third, which was not coupled with the other two, but governed with reins,
and was therefore called ougaros, ouigeefógos, Fagáosicos, &c. ( but in Homer usually ragrogos), and the rein rappogic. The same custom was practised by the Romans till the time of Dionysius the Halicarnassean, though left off in Greece long before. In the eighth Iliad, Hector's chariot seems to be drawn by four horses; for there the hero thus bespeaks them :
Ξάνθε τε, και συ Πόδαρχε, και Αίθων, Λάμπε σε διε. And however some ancient critics will have the two former to be no more
than epithets of the latter, because Hector afterwards speaks to them in
the dual number ; yet it is evident, from other places, that even in Homer's time it was customary to have chariots drawn by four horses..
Every chariot carried two men, whence it was termed diogos, 9. digopos ;' though that word does not, in its strict and proper acceptation, denote the whole chariot, but only that part in which the men were placed. One of these was called “ shoxos, because he governed the reins, which in those days was not a servile or ignoble office, but was frequently undertaken by

OF THE MILITARY AFFAIRS OF GREECE. 447
from them was certain of success and victory ; insomuch that rodopāvee Tibivas, colophonem imponere, was proverbially used for putting a conclu sion to any affair. The Lacedæmonians were but meanly furnished with
cavalry ; and, till the Messenian "wars, it does not appear that either they,
or the rest of the Peloponnesians, employed themselves in horsemanship, but reposed their chief confidence in foot ;. Peloponnesus being a moun tainous and craggy country , and therefore unfit for horsemen, who in such
places become almost useless in fight. But when the Messenians were
subdued, the Spartans, carrying their arms into other countries, soon found the great occasion they had of cavalry to support and cover their foot; and in a short time supplied that defect, by instructing their youth in horsemanship ; to which end we find they had masters in that art,
called ynoxapátou. But the greatest part of their cavalry was furnished by Sciros, a town not far distant from Sparta, the inhabitants of which claimed , as their proper post, the left wing in the Lacedæmonian armies.?
Attica was likewise a hilly country, and therefore not designed by nature for breeding horses ; we find, accordingly , that the Athenian cavalry were very few in number, consisting only of ninety -six horsemen ; for the
whole Athenian nation being anciently divided into forty -eight naucratiæ,
we are told by Pollux that the number of horses each of these was obliged to furnish to the war, was no more than two. And, therefore, it is not wonderful that the Medes thought them deprived of reason , when at the
battle of Marathon they had courage to encounter a strong and numerous army with so small, and apparently contemptible, a force . Having after wards expelled the Medes and Persians out of Greece, and raised them
selves to a flourishing condition, they increased the number of their cavalry to three hundred ; and , not long after, having once more restored
peace to their city, and established it in greater power and splendour than before , they augmented them to twelve hundred , and armed, at the same time, an equal number of men with bows and arrows,8 of which they had before no greater plenty than of horses ; for both then and afterwards the
strength of most of the Grecian armies consisted in their heavy-armed foot.
The Athenians admitted none to serve on horseback, till they had un
dergone a strict probation ; and if any person was found to have fraudu lently insinuated himself into the roll, upon conviction he was declared Tapos, and disfranchised . This consisted, with respect to the men, in a
search after their estates, and observation of their strength and vigour of body ; for no persons were entered into the roll, but such as had plentiful
possessions, and were in good plight of body. This probation was per
formed by the innUX95, or general of the horse, who, if occasion required,

was assisted by the phylarchi, and senate of five hundred . In horses
they observed their obedience to their riders ; and such as they found un governable, or fearful, were rejected. This examination was performed TOū rádwros fópa , bythe sound of a bell, or some other instrument of
that nature : whence xwdwvíce is expounded supážsıv, to try, or prove, and úxwdavotoy is the same with antipastos, unproved . Such horses, likewise, as were worn out with long service , they branded upon the jaw
with a mark , frequently termed ogoxcès, being the figure of a wheel or
circle ; and sometimes rquoiation, whereby the beast was released from farther service. Hence itibáanu tguointiy, is to excuse . Thus in the
following verse of Eupolis: Εθ' ώσπες Κατω μοι επεβαλεις ταυσίππιον. Which was thus expressed by Crates in his comedy, entitled , The Sami
ans : "Ιππω γηράσκονται τα μείονα κύκλ’ επίβαλλε .
We meet with several titles and appellations of horsemen , most of which were derived from the variety of their armour, or from their dif
ferent manner of fighting, as that of ảxpoßorsotai, who annoyed their
enemies with missive weapons at some distance , δορατοφόροι, ξυστοφόρου , İTAXO'TioTaà, i motoğótus, novTopógos, Jupscpógos, with others, the distinc
tion of all which is sufficiently intimated in their names. " ApQITTob, sometimes by mistake, or corruption , called avoto, ' were such as had two horses, on which they rode by turns. They were some times termed ιππαγωγοί, δια το άγειν ίππον, because they led one of their horses, which was not a late contrivance, but practised soon after the
heroic times.5 Alpecéxas, first instituted by Alexander the Great, were a sort of dra goons, and were accommodated with armour something heavier than that
of ordinary horsemen , but not quite so weighty as that of the foot-soldiers,
that they might be ready to serve either on horseback or on foot; for which reason they had servants attending to take their horses, whenever
the general commanded them to alight.
Horsemen were also distinguished into κατάφρακτοι and μη κατάφρακ .. Tos, heavy and light-armed . The raséopaxtol, or cuirassiers, were not only fortified with armour themselves, but had their horses guarded with solid plates of brass, or other metal ; (which , from the members defended
by them, received different names, being called a golletwridice, regúria, παρήγα , προστερνίδια , παραπλευρίδια , παραμηρίδια , παρακνημίδια , &c.) or
with skins, fortified with plates of metal curiously wrought into plumes, or other forms.8
They were likewise bedecked with various ornaments, namely, with
bells, as we find Rhesus' horses in Euripides, with clothing of tapestry ,

embroidery , and other curious work ; with rich collars and trappings, or what the Latins call phalere , the Greeks Páraga, which some will have to be an ornament for the forehead, others for the jaws; nor are there
wanting, who think them to signify all the ornaments belonging to horses. Of camels and elephants, which are so much talked of in the wars of some countries, we have no mention in the Grecian story before the times
of Alexander, when we find a great number of elephants transported from the eastern parts of the world. These were wont to carry into the battle Jarge towers, in which ten , fifteen, and, as some affirm , thirty, soldiers were contained , who annoyed their enemies with missive weapons, them selves being secure and out of danger .] Nor were the beasts idle or use

OF THE GRECIAN ARMS AND WEAPONS, WITH THEIR MILITARY APPAREL .
The
authors
of
fables
tell
us
,
the
first
person
that
put
on
armour
was
Mars
,
who
,
perhaps
for
no
other
reason
,
was
honoured
with
the
title
of
God
of
War
:
it
being
very
frequent
with
the
ancient
heathens
gratefully
to
acknowledge
their
obligations
to
the
first
contrivers
of
any
profitable
invention
,
by
enrolling
them
amongst
their
deities
,
and
decreeing
to
them
the
perpetual
care
and
sovereignty
of
those
useful
and
ingenious
arts
or
contrivances
of
which
they
were
the
inventors
.
The
workman
employed
by
Mars
was
Vulcan
,
at
that
time
a
master

smith
in
the
isle
of
Lemnos
,
and
so
eminent
in
his
profession
,
that
posterity
enrolled
him
among
the
gods
,
and
honoured
him
with
the
superintendency
and
protection
of
his
own
trade
;
but
his
countrymen
,
the
Lemnians
,
were
not
so
fortunate
,
for
they
stand
represented
to
all
ages
as
common
enemies
of
mankind
,
and
branded
with
characters
of
infamy
for
that
execrable
and
pernicious
device
.
Whence
the
poets
have
fixed
upon
them
the
name
of
Zivtis
,
to
perpetuate
the
remembrance
of
the
harm
they
did
to
mankind
.
Their
country
was
likewise
called
Σιντης
3
From the same origin are derived the common proverbs, Angeria xazi, great and intolerable evils ; Anuvíce mrie, a fatal or mischievous hand ; and
Anunvor Baíasıv, to have a cruel and bloody look . Though some will by 110 means allow this character to have been given to the Lemnians for
their invention of arms, but rather for the frequent piracies and outrages
committed by them upon foreigners, or for other reasons: whereas, they tell us, that Liber, or Bacchus, was the first that introduced the use of weapons .

OF
THE
MILITARY
AFFAIRS
OF
GREECE
.
451
The
arms
of
the
primitive
heroes
were
composed
of
brass
,
as
appears
from
Homer
,
who
is
herein
followed
as
well
by
the
ancient
poets
both
Greek
and
Latin
,
as
by
all
other
writers
that
give
account
of
those
times
.
Pausanias
has
endeavoured
to
prove
this
by
a
great
number
of
instances
::
it
is
reported
in
Plutarch
,'
that
when
Cimon
,
the
son
of
Miltiades
,
con
veyed
the
bones
of
Theseus
from
the
isle
of
Scyros
to
Athens
,
he
found
interred
with
him
a
sword
of
brass
,
and
a
spear
with
a
head
of
the
same
metal
.
More
examples
would
be
superfluous
,
since
we
are
expressly
told
1. 2. 3.
hy Hesiod, that there was no such thing as iron in those ages ; but that their arms, all sorts of instruments, and their very houses, were made of brass ,
And in later ages, when the world became acquainted with the use of iron , the artificers and their occupation retained their old names ;* xed
ziùs denotes an iron smith, and5 exam reuoato is applied to the making of iron helmets.
Some of their arms were composed of tin, especially their boots. This metal was likewise frequently used in other parts of their armour.” Several other metals were made use of ; gold and silver were in great esteem among them ; yet the most illustrious heroes used them only as
graceful ornaments : they whose whole armour was composed of them are usually represented as more addicted to effeminate and delicate arts than manly courage and bravery. The arms of Glaucus were indeed made of
gold, but the great Diomedes was content with brass. Amphimachus, who entered into the war with golden weapons, is compared by Honier to a
trim virgin ::

,
engaged
with
the
rough
Grecians
,
richly
adorned
with
gold
and

,
and
became
an

,
The
Grecian
heroes
,
though
not
so
unpolished
as
to
debar
themselves
the
use
of
these
ornaments
,
yet
were
not
so
excessively
profuse
of
them
,
and
did
not
apply
them
to
the
same
ends
and
purposes
.
The
shield
of
Achilles
,
so
curiously
engraved
by
Vulcan
,
is
a
lecture
of
philosophy
,
and
contains
a
description
of
almost
all
the
works
of
nature
.
The
arms
of
other
valiant
princes
are
frequently
adorned
with
representations
of
their
noble
exploits
,
the
history
of
the
actions
of
their
ancestors
,
or
blessings
received
from
the
gods
;
or
filled
with
terrible
images
of
lions
or
dragons
,
and
rendered
bright
and
shining
,
to
strike
terror
and
amazement
into
their
enemies
.
So
it
is
reported
of
our
British
ancestors
,
that
they
painted
themselves
with
divers
forms
of
animals
,
thinking
thereby
to
appear
more
terrible
to
their
enemies
.
The ancient Grecians were always armed, thinking it unsafe to venture
abroad without a sufficient defence against aggressors. Hence Aristotle has rationally inferred, that they were a barbarous and uncivilized nation :
for being educated in the deepest ignorance, and having very little sense of that justice and honesty, to which all men are obliged by nature's
eternal and immutable sanctions; being also in ' a great measure without the restraint of human laws, all persons thought they had a just title to
whatever they could by any means take into possession , which they had no other method to secure, but that by which they obtained it, and resigned their claim whenever a more potent adversary exhibited his pretensions,
The seas were filled with pirates, the land with robbers, who made a prey of whatever came to their hands, and frequently made incursions into
countries, which they spoiled and depopulated, and if their force was great enough, drove out the inhabitants, and compelled them to seek new settle
ments. By men of this profession, Io, Europa, Ganymedes, and many
others, were stolen ; which put Tyndarus in such a fear for his daughter Helen, that he caused all the young princes that paid their addresses to her, to bind themselves by a solemn oath to recover her, if ever she should be conveyed away . The sea, we are informed by Thucydides, was freed
from piracies by Minos king of Crete , who, with a powerful navy, main tained for many years the sovereignty of it. But the land was still in fested ; and therefore when Theseus proposed to make his first journey from Troezen to Athens, Plutarch tells us, that his relations would have persuaded him to go by sea. • For ,' says he, it was hazardous, at that
time, to go by land to Athens, because no part was free from the danger of ruffians and robbers. Those times, indeed, produced men of strong and
'indefatigable powers of body, of extraordinary swiftness and agility ; but

they
applied
those
powers
to
nothing
just
or
useful.
On
the
contrary,
their
genius
,
their
disposition
,
their
pleasures,
tended
only
to
insolence,
to
violence,
and
to
rapine
.
As
for
modesty
,
justice
,
equity,
and
humanity
,
they
looked
upon
them
as
qualities
in
which
those
who
had
in
their
power
to
add
to
their
possessions
,
had
no
manner
of
concern
;
virtues
praised
only
by
such
as
were
afraid
of
being
injured
,
and
who
abstained
from
injuring
others
out
of
the
same
principle
of
fear.'1
Of
these
,
indeed
,
Hercules
and
Theseus,
and
other
generous
and
public

spirited
princes
,
in
a
great
measure
,
freed
the
country
:
but
before
that
,
it
was
not
wonderful
if
the
Grecians
always
wore
arms,
standing
upon
their
guard
;
especially
since
,
in
those
days
,
few
of
them
were
united
into
large
towns,
but
lived
retiredly
in
country
seats
,
or
,
at
the
best
,
in
small
and
defenceless
ham
lets
.
This
custom
was
first
laid
aside
at
Athens
,
the
occasion
and
neces
sity
thereof
being
first
moved
in
that
city
:
2
for
historians
generally
agree
,
that
the
Athenians
entertained
the
decent
rules
of
civility
and
humanity
,
were
modelled
into
a
regular
form
of
government,
and
enjoyed
the
happi
ness
of
wholesome
and
useful
laws
before
the
rest
of
the
Greeks
.
After
wards
a
penalty
was
laid
by
Solon
upon
those
who
wore
arms
in
the
city
without
necessity
;
s
that
having
in
former
times
been
the
occasion
of
fre
quent
murders
,
robberies,
and
duels
.
On
the
same
account
was
made
the
following
law
of
Zaleucus
,

that
no

.
The
Grecian
arms
are
distinguished
into
two
sorts
,
some
of
them
being
contrived
for
their
own
defence,
others
to
annoy
their
enemies
.
The
pri
mitive
Greeks,
we
are
told
,'
were
better
furnished
with
the
former
,
where
as
the
barbarians
were
most
industrious
in
providing
the
latter
:
the

of
these

most

,
whilst
the
Greeks
thought
it
more
agreeable
to
the
dictates
of
human
nature
to
study
how
to
preserve
their
friends
:
for
which
reason
Homer
always
takes
care
to
introduce
his
brave
and
valiant
heroes
well
armed
into
the
battle
;
and
the
Greciau
lawgivers
decreed
punishments
for
those
that
threw
away
their
shields,
but
excused
those
that
lost
their
swords
or

;

that
their

First,
let
us
take
an
account
of
their

as

the

the

at

which

sometimes taken for the name of a helmet, though consisting of another sort of matter. Thus Homer :1 αμφί δε οι κυνέην κεφαλήφιν έθηκε He put on 's helmet, of a bull's hide made. Ταυρείην.
These skins were always worn with their hair on ; and to render them more terrible and frightful, the teeth were frequently placed grinning on their enemies,2 The forepart of the helmet was open ; for the heroes all entered into the
Oo
battle with faces uncovered ; to the side was fixed a string, by which it
was tied to the warrior's neck. This was termed óx :ù5.3 Some of its parts received their names from the members guarded by them , as opgúsi , that part which covered the eyebrows, and the rest in like manner . The little lappet erected over the brow was, by a metaphorical term , called gooy, the pent-house. But the most remarkable of all the parts in the
helmet was its crest, termed paos, and aópos,4 which was first used by
the Carians, and thence called by Alcæus Kapinos aópos ;5 for the Carians were once famous for military exploits, and obliged the world with this and several other inventions : hence we are told 6 that it was customary
for them to reposit a little shield and a helmet in the graves of their dead. Some will have páros to be distinguished from cópos, that signi
fying the conus, this the plume fixed to it ;? but others allow no difference between them. The former was composed of various materials, most of
which were rich and costly, being designed as ornaments to the helmet. The latter likewise was adorned with divers sorts of paint ; whence it obtained the epithets of ευανθής , υακινθινοβαφής.8 Homer has enriched it
with gold . One of Virgil's heroes has his whole helmet of gold, and his crest painted red . 10 The crest was for the most part of feathers, or of the hair of horses'
tails or manes ; whence we read of λόφος ίπποχαίτος, κορυς ιπποδάσεια , and LTTOURIS.11 The common soldiers had small crests ; officers, and persons

of quality , were distinguished by plumes of a larger size, and frequently took a pride in wearing two, three, or four together. Suidas will have Geryon to have been famous in poetry for three heads, on no other account but because his helmet was adorned with three crests. Virgil describes the head -piece of Turnus after the same manner, adding also to it the figure of a chimæra . This helmet was called trupázsia ; when it was
surrounded with plumes, új pápados ; and when adorned with four, terçá Qudos.2 The design of these was to strike terror into their enemies. For the same reason , Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, besides a lofty crest, wore goats' horns upon his helmet." We are told indeed by Suidas, that the
Teixwois, or crest itself, was sometimes termed vigas. Nevertheless, some of the ancient helmets had no crest or cone at all. This sort was
called xcruitvę. Other sorts of ornaments were used in helmets, as in that called otepárn, which name signifies the ridge of a mountain, and was on
that account applied to helmets, having several igoxai, eminences, or parts jutting out. Of all the Grecian helmets, the Boeotian is said to have been the best.' The Macedonians had a pe culiar one, termed ravoin, which was composed of hides, and served instead of a cap to defend them from the cold . Pliny attributes the invention of helmets to the Lacedæmonians,' as likewise of the Xos. 1 and 2 are Grecian warriors in different styles of armour. No. 3, a Grecian warrior in a tra

sword and spear ; but this must be understood only of the peculiar sorts of those weapons used at Sparta ; other kinds of them being known before
the first foundation of the Spartan government, or nation . The heroes prided themselves in wearing for their defence the skins of wild beasts, which they esteemed badges of their prowess. The lion's skin
of Hercules is very famous in story, and Homer's great princes are fre quently introduced in the same habit ; in imitation of whom the other
Greek and Latin poets have armed their heroes . But we find they were not ashamed of using better and stronger armour for their defence, the ordinary sorts of which were these that follow : Miten, made of brass, but lined with wool, and worn next to the skin , underneath the coat of mail. This we learn from Homer, speaking of a dart that pierced through the rest of the hero's armour, but was so blunted
by the péten , that it only rased his skin . Zwa, or Sworting, reached from the knees to the belly , where it was joined to the brigandine. But the latter of these names is more fre quently taken for the belt surrounding the rest of the armour ; and this was so essential to a warrior, that Šúryvolan came to be a general name for
putting on armour :6 'Ατρείδης δε βόησεν, ιδε ζώννυσθαι άνωγεν. Atrides straight commands them all to arm .,
When Homer makes Agamemnon resemble the god of war in his sára, he is supposed ' to mean his whole armour. The Romans had the same
custom :8 and it prevailed also amongst the Persians, whence Herodotus relates, how Xerxes having reached Abdera , when he fled from Athens,
and thinking himself out of danger, did atau Tony Gávnv, or disarm himself.”
But járn is a more general name than žwotòg, and signifies the píten. Ougat consisted of two parts, one of which was a defence to the back ,
the other to the breast ; the extreme
parts of it were termed Friquuss,
the middle γύαλα.10 The sides were coupled together with a sort of but
tons.11 The same may be observed in Silius of the Roman lorica ,12 which differed not much from the Grecian
thorax, whence Jágaz is by Hesychius expounded awgíxio. qua fibula morsus

tation to his soldiers to turn their backs upon their enemies, commanded them to lay aside their back pieces and arm themselves with vuilwgória , breast-plates ; that so , whenever they were put to flight, their backs might be exposed naked to their enemies. The thoraces were not all composed of the same stuff ; some were made of lint, or hemp twisted into small cords, and close set together; whence we read of thoraces bilices, and trilices, from the number of cords fixed one upon another. These were frequently used in hunting, because the teeth of lions, and other wild
beasts were unable to pierce through them, sticking in the cords ; but were not so often carried into battle :' yet there are not wanting instances of
this sort ; for Ajax the son of Oileus has the epithet of anothenž. Alex ander, likewise, is reported to have worn Júpaxa duvoû dadoīv, a double twisted linen thorax : and Iphicrates caused his soldiers to lay aside their
heavy and unwieldy brigandines of iron, and go to the field in hempen armour." Thoraces were commonly made of brass, iron, or other metal,
which was sometimes so exquisitely hardened , as to be proof against the greatest force. 5 Zoilus an artificer having made a present of two iron
brigandines to Demetrius Poliorcetes, for an experiment of their hardness, caused an arrow to be shot out of an engine called catapulta, placed about
twenty -six paces off ; which was so far from piercing the iron , that it scarcely rased , or made the least impression on it. This armour was of two sorts ; one of which, because it consisted of one piece of metal, or of two-continued pieces, and was inflexible, and able to stand upright, was
termed Fágaz orádios, or orarós. The other was composed of a beast's hide, according to the poet:
- τώ δε θώρακος σκύτει.
Whence the Latin word lorica is thought to be derived from lorum . This was set with plates of metal in various forms; sometimes in hooks, or rings, not unlike a chain ; sometimes resembling feathers, or the scales of
serpents, or fishes; to which plates or studs of gold were often added :
whence we read of θώρακες αλυσιδωτοι , λεσιδωτοι, φολιδωτοί, &c. And the Greek and Latin poets frequently mention them . Thus Silius, speak ing of the consul Flaminius :? Loricam induitur, tortos huic nexilis hamos His coat of mail dieplays its hooked joints, squama rudi, permistoque asperat auro. Studded with gold, and rough with iron points.
Forro
T.
Virgil arms his heroes after the same manner :
Rutulum thoraca indutus, aënis Dress'd in his glittering breastplate, he appear'd Hortebat squamis. Frightful with scales of brass.
The single plates being sometimes pierced through by spears, and mis sive weapons, it was customary to strengthen them by setting two, three, or more, upon one another. Thus Statius :9
ter insuto servant ingentia ferro With triple plates of iron they defend
Pectora, Their breasts.

It is probable that this piece of armour was at first either peculiar to the Greeks, or at least
more generally used by them than by other
nations ; because we find them so perpetually called by the poet, εύκνήμιδες Αχαιοί.
Keipes were guards for the hands, which we find also to have been used
by some of them , with other defences for their arms. 'Aoris, a buckler . This was first used by Pro
tus and Acrisius of Argos. It was sometimes coru
posed of wickers woven together : hence it is termed izéa . It was likewise made of wood ; and because it was expedient that the warriors should be
able to wield it with the greatest ease, they usually
chose the lightest sort of wood for this use, as fig,
willow , beech, poplar, elder -tree, & c. But it was commonly made of hides ; whence we find so frequent mention of uorids;
Bosire . These were doubled into several folds, and fortified with plates or metal. The buckler of Ajax was composed of seven folds of hide, and
covered with a single plate of brass.10 That of Achilles was guarded with
three folds more, as the poet tells us : et æs, et proxima rupit It pierc'd the brass, and through nine Nices it Terga novena boum, decimo tamen urbe moratum est, broke ;

The principal parts of the buckler were these : "Aytv, frus, tigipsguise, or xúxãos, the utmost round or circumference. Oppáros and reso opepáxsov, (Lat., umbo ,) a boss jutting out in the mid
dle of the buckler, upon which was fixed another protuberant part, termed itoupárson. This was of great service to them, not only in giancing off, and repelling missive weapons, but in bearing down their enemies. Whence Martial has this allusion :
In turbam incideris, cunctos umbone repellet. Should you be in a crowd, your slave Would with his boss repel them all,
Traceue's was a thong of leather, and sometimes a rod of metal, reaching across the buckler, by which they hung it upon
their shoulders, according to the primitive fashion.1
It was sometimes called xarwy, unless this may be understood of the rod to which
the shadwy was fastened, which seems most probable ; and that nevóves were rods where
hy the bucklers were held, (as Homer's scholiast reports ), but Teace peñves were the thongs affixed to them , and hung
upon the warrior's shoulders, though Eustathius will have them to have been put to the former use, and to be the same with zaróves . Sometimes
the bucklers were held by little rings, called Fógtares ; but at length most of the Greeks used a handle called öxavov, or ózárn, which, though
sometimes spoken of with the former names, and explained by them , was
really different from both, being invented by the Carians, and, as it is
commonly thought, composed for the most part of small iron bars, placed across each other, and resembling the letter x . When the wars were ended , and the bucklers, as was customary, were hung up in the temples
of the gods, they took off the handles, thereby to render them unfit to serve in any sudden insurrection : whence Aristophanes introduces a per
son afrighted , when he saw bucklers hanging up with handles :
Ο μοι τάλας, έχουσι γαρ πόρπακας.

works of nature , which custom
was derived from the heroic ages, and continued in later times, be
ing ? first introduced by the Ca rians, and from them communi
cated to the Greeks, Romans, and Barbarians.
The Greeks had several sorts of bucklers, the most remarkable of which seem to have been those of
Argos, which are thought to have
beer larger than the rest ; hence Virgil compares them to Polyphemus' monstrous eye, which he tells us
was, 2 Argolici clypei, aut Phæbeæ lampadis instar. Like an Argolic buckler, or the sun.
Most, indeed, of the ancient bucklers seem to have covered the whole
body ; whence Virgil:3 clypeique sub orbe teguntur. Under their bucklers, covered close, they stand.
Tyrtæus enumerates the members protected thereby : Μηρούς τε, κνήμας κάτω, και στέρνα, και ώμους Thighs, legs, and breast, belly and shoulders all, 'Ασπίδος ευρείης γαστρί καλυψάμενος. The mighty bucklers cover'd .
This farther appears from the custom of carrying dead soldiers out of the field upon their bucklers ; hence we read of the famous command of
the Spartan mothers to their sons, "H sày, x ixà sàn, Either bring this (meaning the buckler ), or be brought upon it ; meaning they should either
secure their bucklers, or lose their lives in defending them .' And Homer, for the same reason , calls them, ασπίδας αμφιβρότας, and ποδηνεχείς,
which Eustathius interprets avdeóunxsis, of the same size with a man ,5
Their form was usually round, whence Virgil's clypei orbis, and the frequent mention of dorides töruxãos, távTots docet, &c. Hence the ut most circumference was called κύκλος ..
There were likewise shields of less size, and other forms, the use of several of which was later than the heroic ages, répov, or géppa, was squared like the figure rhombus, and was first used
by the Persians..
Oupeos was oblong, and usually bending inward : it seems to have been
the same as that which is called ασπίς κοίλη ετερομήκης.7 Aavońcoy seems to have been shaped like the former, and composed of hides with the hair , whence grammarians derive it from whores, hairy .
It was very light, whence Homer gives it the epithet #Tigóev.8 Téarn was a small and light buckler in the form of a half-moon , or , according to Xenophon, of an ivy -leaf, and was first used by the Amazons.

This
was
the
chief
of
all
their

the
regard
they
had
for

appears
both
from
what
has
been
already
observed
concerning
their
care
in
adorn

preserving
it
,
and
from
the
common
story
of
Epaminondas
,
who
,
when
he
had
received
a
mortal
wound
,
and
was
lying
under
the
agonies
of
death
,
with
great
concern
inquired
whether
his
buckler
was
safe

rather
chose
honour
ably
to
resign
his
life
with
his
buckler
,
than
leaving
it
,
to
escape
to
another
vessel.2
Military
glory
indeed
being
esteemed
the
greatest
of
which
human
nature
was
capable
,
they
had
a
profound
regard
for
all
sorts
of
arms
,
which
were
the
instruments
whereby
they
attained
it
;
whence
,
to
leave
them
to
their
enemies
,
to
give
them
for
a
pledge
,
or
to
dispose
of
them
in
any
dishonourable
way
,
was
an
indelible
disgrace
,
both
in
Greece
,
3
and
at
Rome
,
and
scarce
ever
to
be
atoned
for
.
Thus have I endeavoured to give you a description of the principal of
the Grecian defensive arms, which are in general termed åastntáciu,
σκεπαστήρια , and προβλήματα. The only offensive arms used by the ancients were stones or clubs, and
such as rude nature furnished them with. They were wholly ignorant of
TITI all those arts and contrivances to destroy their enemies, which necessity and thirst of glory afterwards introduced into the world. These clubs
were called páranyes and parcynoce; whence grammarians 5 conjecture that squadrons of soldiers were termed párayyes , and by the Latins pha langes, from this primitive way of fighting.
'The principal of their offensive weapons in later ages, was ‘yxo; ard escu, a spear, or pike, the body of which was composed of wood, in the
heroic times most commonly of ash ; whence we have so frequent mention
in Homer of pesain. The head, aizpi , was of metal. So was also the
σαυρωτήρ which is so called either g. σταυρωτήρ, from σταυρός, α cross; or from oaūgos, a lizard , which it is said to have resembled , being hollow at one end, where it was fixed into the bottom of the spear, and sharp at the
other, and, being thrust into the ground , held the spear erect, when the soldiers rested from the toil of war.8 Aristotle observes, that this custom

was practised among the Illyrians in his days.3 And it seems to have been common in other
nations, as may appear from the first Book of Samuel," where Saul is said to have slept with his spear fixed in the earth, close by his head . In times of peace they reared their spears against pillars, in a long wooden case called dovpodózn .
There were two sorts of spears ;6 the former was used in close fight, and
was called dópu ógextòr ; for the use and excellent management of which the Abantes are celebrated in Homer :?
Το δ' άμ''Αβαντες έποντο 9οοί , όπιθεν κομόωντες, Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air; Αιχμηται ,μεμαώτες ορεκτησι μελίσσι But with protended spears, in fighting fields
θώρακας ρήξειν όητων αμφί στήθεσσι. Pierce the tough corselets and the brazen shields. Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair, Where may be observed the signification of the word ópížaolal, which, as the scholiast remarks, is applied to arms used in close fight ; whereas
rádass belongs rather to missive weapons, which are called by the general names of raarà and Bian, of which kind was the other sort of spears. This was frequently used in the heroic duels, where the comba
tants first threw their spears, and then made use of their swords. Thus Hector and Achilles,8 Menelaus and Paris,9 and the rest of the heroes attack one another : thus also Castor and Lynceus. 1
The Macedonians had a peculiar sort of spear called págiroa , which was fourteen or sixteen cubits in length.
Eipos, a sword , which, according to ancient custom , was hung in a belt
put round the shoulder,11 and reached down to the thighs.12 It may be inquired whether the sword was hung upon the right side or
the left; to which some reply, that foot -soldiers wore it on the left, horse
men on the right: and Josephus 13 expressly mentions horsemen with their swords on their right sides : but whether this was constantly observed, or
frequently varied, as Lipsius has observed of the Roman sword , 14 cannot easily be determined. The scabbard was called xoasos : close to it was

They had sometimes another sword called xoris , which was the same with the Roman ensis
falcatus, and our falchion , or scimitar, and was chiefly used by the inha bitants of Argos. Not much unlike this were the Lacedæmonian swords,
called ξυίναι, or ξυήλαι, and by the Athenians κνήστιες.9 They were bent like falchions, and were much shorter than those commonly used in other parts of Greece : when the reason of this circumstance was demanded of Antalcidas ; it is, said he, because we encounter our enemies hand to hand ; 10 and when another person told Agesilaus in derision , that a juggler on a
stage would make nothing of swallowing their swords: well, replied the
king, yet, with these little weapons, we are able to reach our enemies.!! The
only thing farther remarkable in the old Grecian sword is the hilt, which they took great pride in adorning, not so much with silver and gold, and
precious stones, as with figures of lions' heads, &c. to make them appear more terrible to their enemies.

OF THE MILITARY AFFAIRS OF GREECE. 465
a bow , which he bequeathed to Philoctetes for his care in kindling the pile wherein he was burned alive.
Both the poets seem particularly to remark the incurvation of the Scy thian bow, which distinguished it from the bows of Greece and other nations, and was so great as to form a half -moon, or semicircle. Whence
the shepherd in Athenæus,3 being to describe the letters in Theseus' name, and expressing each of them by some apposite resemblance, com
pares the third to the Scythian bow :
Σκυθικό δέ τόξω το τρίτον ήν παρεμφερές.
The
third
was
like
a
Scythian
bow
.
Meaning not the more modern character ?, but the ancient, C , which is
semicircular, and bears the third place in OHCETC. The Grecian bows
were frequently beautified with gold , or silver ; whence we have mention
of aurei arcus, and Apollo is called úgyugótoğos ; but the matter of which they were composed seems for the most part to have been wood, though
they were anciently, Scythian - like, made of horn . Whence Lycophron , who affects antiquated customs and expressions, speaks thus of Apollo encountering Idas with his bow :5
--ιν χάρμαισι ραιβώσας κέρας.. in battles bent his horn ,
But some ancient glossographers, by régas, would rather understand reix wors, or the bowstring, which was composed of horse's hair, and there fore called also if sic : 6 to which custom Accius alludes :
Reciproca tendens nervo equino concita Tela .
Drawing the arrows with a horse's hair.
Homer's bowstrings are frequently made of hides cut into small thongs: hence róza Bós.ceo? One thing more is remarkable in their bows; it is
that part to which the string was fixed, being upon the uppermost part of the bow , and called zopárn, commonly made of gold, and the last thing towards finishing a bow ; whence Homer, when he has described the manner of making a bow , adds after all :
χρυσέην επέθηκε κορώνην..
Hence χρυσής επιτιθέναι κορώνην signifies to bring any affair to a harry conclusion .
The arrows usually consisted of light wood , and an iron head , which
was commonly hooked.8 Sometimes they were armed with two, three, or four hooks.9 In this sense likewise Hippocrates' tergáywiae Béan are to be understood. The

leads of arrows were sometimes besmeared with poison ; for which piece
of inhuman skill Virgil's Amycus was famous:) inde ferarum Who dipp'd the envenom'd steel with matchless
Vastatorem Amycum , quo non felicior alter art, Ungere tela manu, ferrumque armare veneno. And double arm'd with death the pointed dart.
Then fierce on Amycus the warrior came, PITT . Whose fatal arrow pierc'd the savage game ;
This practice was more frequent in barbarous nations, but seldom used
or understood in Greece ; wherefore Minerva in Homer having assumed the form and titles of Mentes, of the Taphians, and son to Anchialus,
pretends that her father, out of an extraordinary love to Ulysses, obliged him with a quantity of this deadly ointment, after he had been at the pains of a tedious journey to Ephyra, to furnish himself ; but had been
denied it by Ilus, the son of Mermerus, who, as the poet tells us, rejected Ulysses' request out of a scruple of conscience , being afraid that divine vengeance would prosecute so criminal an action :
'Εξ 'Εφύρης ανιόντος παρ' "Ιλου Μερμερίλαο, Measur'd a length of seas, a toilsome length , in ( Ωχετο γαρ κακείσε τους επ : νηός Οδυσσευς vain .

Arrows were usually winged with feathers to increase their speed and force ; whence Homer's ategócis ios,3 m repósis õiotòs ;4 Oppian's orròs

bow, the heroes carried upon their backs.10
In drawing bows, the primitive Greeks did not pull back their hand
towards their right ear, according to the fashion of modern ages, and of the ancient Persians ; ll but placing their bows directly before them, re turned their hand upon their right breast :12 which was the custom of the
Amazonian women, who are reported to have cut off their right breasts lest they should be an impediment in shooting ; on which account their
name is commonly thought to have been derived from the privative par ticle

and

from
their
want
of
a

some

and
called
in
Greek

in
Latin
,

the

,
which
is
also
used
sometimes
in
a
more
general
sense
for
any
sort
of
darting
,
though
with
out
straps.
The
javelin
thus
cast
was
termed
μεσάγκυλον
;
the
custom
is
mentioned
in
the
Roman
as
well
as
Greek
writers
:
whence
Seneca,
in
his
Hippolytus:

Et

The
ancient
Greeks
were
wont
to
annoy
their
ene
mies
with
great
stones,
such
as
the
joint
strength
of
several
men
in
our
days
would
be
unable
so

to

Ajax

weapons
;
and
the
latter
had
his
buckler
broken
with
a
stone
scarce
inferior
in
bigness
to
a
millstone
.
The
gods
themselves
did
not
disdain
to
make
use
of
them
,
as
appears
from
Homer's
Minerva
,
who
attacked
the
god
of
war
with
a
stone
of
a
prodigious
size
,
which
had
been
in
former
ages
placed
as

But
,
although
the
heroic
fights
were
carried
on
in
this
manner
,
as
most
of
the
ancient
poets
witness
;
yet
in
nearer
ages
,
when
they
tell
us
men's
strength
and
courage
were
lessened
,
but
their
policy
and
conduct
improved
,
we
seldom

any

the

mon
in

engagements
was
,
divdóvn, a sling ; which, we are told by some, was invented hy the na tives of the Balearic islands, where it was managed with so great art and
dexterity, that young children were not allowed any food by their mothers, till they could sling it down from the beam , where it was placed aloft ;8
and when they arrived to be of age to serve in the wars, this was the principal of their offensive arms; it being customary for all of them to be furnished with three slings, which either hung about their necks, or

were carried , one on their necks, one in their hands, and a third about their loins.1 Hence the Balearic
slings are famous in ancient writers." It was likewise common in Greece,
especially among the Acarnanians,3
who were well skilled in managing it, and are by some thought to have invented it : others give that honour to the Ætolians. 4 But none of the
Greeks managed it with so much art and dexterity as the Achaians,
who inhabited Ægium , Dyma, and
Patræ : they were brought up to this exercise from their infancy ,5 and are thought by some to have excelled the Balearians : whence it became a
custom to call any thing directly
levelled
at
the
mark
,

This
weapon
was
used
for
the
most
part
by
the
common
and
light

armed
soldiers
:
Cyrus
is
said
to
have
thought
it
very
unbecoming
an
officer
;)
and
Alexander
,
endeavouring
to
render
his
enemies
as
contemptible
to
his
own
soldiers
as
he
could
,
tells
them
,
they
were
a
confused
and
disorderly
rabble
,
some
of
them
having
no
weapon
but
a
javelin
;
others
were
de
signed
for
no
greater
service
than
to
cast
stones
out
of
a
sling
;
and
very
few
were
regularly
armed
.
»
8
The
form
of
a
sling
we
may
learn
from
Dionysius
,
by
whom
the
earth
is
said
to
resemble
it
,
being
not
ex
actly
spherical
,
but
extended
out
in
length
,
and
broad
in
the
middle
;
for
slings
resemble
&
platted
rope
,
somewhat
broad
in
the
middle
,
with
an
oval
compass
,
and
so
by
little
and
little
decreasing
into
two
thongs
,
or
reins.9
Its
matter
seems
not
to
have
been
always
the
same
;
in
Homer
we
find
it
composed
of
a
sheep's
fleece
;
and
therefore
one
of
the
heroes
being
wounded
in
the
hand
,
Agenor
binds
it
with
a
sling

The
manner
of
slinging
was
by
whirling
it
twice
or
thrice
about
their
head
,
and
so
casting
out
the
bullet
.
But
Vegetius
commends
those
as
the
greatest
artists,
that
cast
out
the
bullet
with
one
turn
about
the
head
.
How
far
this
weapon
carried
its
load
is
expressed
in
this
verse
:
Fundum
Varro
uocat,
quem
possis
mittere
funda
.
Its
force
was
so
great
,
that
neither
head

piece
,
buckler
,
or
any
other
armour
,
was
a
sufficient
defence
against
it
;
and
so
vehement
its
motion
,
that,
as
Seneca
reports
,
the
plummets
were
frequently
melted
.
Lastly,
we
find
mention
of
fire

balls,
or
hand

grenadoes,
called
upoßó
λοι
λίθοι
,
&
c
.
One
sort
of
them
are
called
σκυτάλια
,
οι
σκυταλίδες
,
which
were
composed
of
wood
,
and
some
of
them
a
foot,
others
a
cubit
in
length
;
their
heads
were
armed
with
spikes
of
iron
,
beneath
which
were
placed
torches
,
hemp,
pitch
,
or
such
like
combustible
matter
,
which
being
set
on
fire
,
they
were
thrown
with
great
force
towards
the
enemy's
first
ranks,
head
foremost
,
whereby
the
iron
spikes
being
fastened
to
whatever
came
in
their
way
,
they
burned
down
all
before
them
:?
wherefore
they
seem
to
have
been
of
the
greatest
use
to
leaguers
,
to
demolish
the
enemy's
works
;
though
my
author
mentions
no
such
thing
.
Concerning
military
apparel,
nothing
certain
or
constant
can
be
related
;
only
it
may
be
observed
,
that
Lycurgus
ordered
the
Lacedæmonians
to
clothe
their
soldiers
with
scarlet
:
the
reason
of
which
institution
seems
either
to
have
been
,
because
that
colour
is
both
soonest
imbibed
by
cloth
,
and
most
lasting
and
durable
;
3
or
on
account
of
its
brightness
and
splen
dour
,
which
that
lawgiver
thought
conducive
to
raise
men's
spirits
,
and
most
suitable
to
minds
animated
with
true
valour
;
4
or
lastly
,
because
it
was
most
proper
to
conceal
the
stains
of
blood
,
a
sight
of
which
might
either
dispirit
the
raw
and
inexperienced
soldiers
of
their
own
party
,
or
inspire
their
enemies
with
fresh
life
and
vigour:
5
which
Eustathius
ob
serves
to
have
been
well
and
wisely
considered
,
when
he
comments
on
that
passage
of
Homer
,
where
the
dejected
Trojans,
upon
seeing
Ulysses'
blood
flow
from
his
wound
,
receive
new
courage
,
and
animating
one
another,
rush
with
united
force
upon
the
hero
:
6
Τρώες

Gush from his wounds; then with new life iu

The Trojans saw Ulysses' blood Each stirr'd the other up, and with joint force
Rush'd
on
the
hero.
It
is
farther
remarkable
of
the
Lacedæmonians
,
that
they
never
engaged
their
enemies
but
with
crowns
and
garlands
upon
their
heads
,
"
though
at
other
times
they
were
unaccustomed
to
such
ornaments
:
hereby
making
sure
of
success
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
anticipating
their
victory
,
crowns
being
the
ordinary
rewards
presented
to
conquerors
in
all
parts
of
Greece
.
So
wonderful
,
indeed
,
were
the
old
Lacedæmonian
courage
and
fortune
,
that
they
encountered
their
enemies
fearless
and
unconcerned
,
joining
battle
with
assurance
of
victory
;
which
was
a
thing
so
common
to
them
,
that
for
their
greatest
successes
,
they
seldom
sacrificed

the
gods

more than a cock ; nor were they much elevated when the happy news arrived, nor made presents of any value to the messengers thereof, as was usual in other cities : for after the famous battle of Mantinea , we find the
person that carried the express of victory , rewarded only with a piece of
powdered beef.1
The soldiers usually carried their own provisions, which consisted , for
the most part, of salt meat, cheese, olives, onions, &c.; for which purpose every one had a vessel of wickers, with a long narrow neck , called yursos, whence men with long necks are by the comedian termed in derision

CHAP. V.
OF THE OFFICERS IN THE ATHENIAN AND LACEDÆMONIAN ARMIES .
The Grecian cities being governed by different laws, the nature and titles
of their offices, whether in military or civil affairs, must of consequence be distinguished. Wherefore, it being an endless undertaking to recount the various commands throughout the whole Grecian nation , I shall only pre sent you in this place with a short view of the chief offices in the Athe nian and Lacedæmonian armies,
In the primitive times, when most states were governed by kings. the
supreme command belonged to them of course ; and it was one principal part of their duty towards their subjects, to lead them forth in person against their enemies, and in single combat to encounter the bravest of
them at the head of their armies. And it may be observed , that when any prince, through cowardice, or other weakness, was judged unable to
protect his people, it was customary for them , withdrawing their alle giance, to substitute a person better qualified in his place ; a memorable instance of which we have in Thymoetes, an Athenian king, who declining
à challenge sent by Xanthus king of Boeotia, was deposed without farther
ado, and succeeded by a foreigner, one Melanthius a Messenian, who undertook to revenge the quarrel of Athens on the Boeotians."
Yet, on some occasions, it was not impracticable for the king to nc minate a person of eminent worth and valour to be his Tonépazxos , or general, who either commanded under the king, or , when the emergency
of other affairs required his absence, supplied his place ; which honourable
post was conferred by king Erechtheus upon Ion, the son of Xuthus, in the Eleusinian war.
But the government being at length devolved upon the people, affairs were managed after a new method ; for all the tribes being invested with

an equal share of power, it was appointed that each of them should nominate a commander out of their own body. That this was done in the time of
Cimon, appears from Plutarch . But whether each of the tribes perpetu ally made choice of one of their own body, or sometimes named men of other tribes, is not very certain . No person was appointed to this com mand, unless he had children and land within the territory of Athens.? Those were accounted pledges to the commonwealth . And sometimes
the children were punished for the treason of their fathers ; which though
seemingly cruel and unjust, was yet antiquum et omnium civitatum , 'an ancient custom , and received in all cities,' as Cicero hath observed . He gives us in the same place an instance in Themistocles' children , whı
suffered for the crimes of their father. Hence Sinon in Virgil, pretend
ing to have quitted the Greek for the Trojan interest, speaks thus of his children :
Quos illifors ad pænas ob nostra reposcent Whom haply Greece to slavghter has deereed, Efugia, et culpam hanc miserorum morte piabunt. And for my fatal fight condemned to bleed. PITT.
To
return
to
our
subject.
The
nomination
of
the
generals
was
made
in
an
assembly
of
the
people
,
which
,
on
this
occasion
,
was
convened
in
the
pnyx
,
and
frequently
lighted
upon
the
same
persons
,
if
they
behaved
themselves
with
courage
and
prudence
,
and
executed
their
office
for
the
safety
and
honour
of
their
country
;
insomuch
that
it
is
reported
of
Pho
cion
,
that
he
was
a
commander
five
-and

forty
times
,
though
he
never
sued
or
canvassed
for
that
honour
,
but
was
always
promoted
by
the
free
and
voluntary
choice
of
the
people
.
Before
their
admission
to
office
,
they
took
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
commonwealth
,
in
which
one
thing
is
more
peculiarly
remarkable
,
viz
.
that
they
obliged
themselves
to
invade
the
Me
garians
twice
every
year
:
this
clause
was
first
inserted
in
the
oath
by
a
decree
preferred
by
Charinus
,
on
account
of
Anthemocritus
,
an
Athenian
herald
,
whom
the
Megarians
had
barbarously
murdered
about
the
begin
ning
of
the
Peloponnesian
war
.
This
done
,
the
command
of
all
the
forces
,
and
warlike
preparations
,
was
intrusted
in
their
hands
to
be
em
ployed
and
managed
as
they
judged
convenient
;
yet
was
not
their
power
absolute
or
unlimited
,
for
it
was
ordered
,
that
upon
the
expiration
of
their
command
,
they
should
be
liable
to
render
an
account
of
their
administra
tion
:
only
on
some
extraordinary
occasions
,
it
seemed
fit
to
exempt
them
from
this
restraint
,
and
send
them
with
full
and
uncontrollable
authority
,
and
then
they
were
styled
Aŭtoxgátoges
:
'
which
title
was
conferred
on
Aristides
,
when
he
was
general
,
at
the
famous
battle
of
Plataa
;
upon
Nicias
,
Alcibiades
,
and
Lamachus
,
in
the
Sicilian
expedition
,
and
several
others
.
These
commanders
were
ten
,
according
to
the
number
of
the
Athenian
tribes
,
and
were
all
called

despatched all together in expeditions of concern and moment, where every one enjoyed the supreme command by days. But lest, in contro
verted matters, an equality of voices should retard their proceedings, we find an eleventh person joined in commission with them, who was called
Ioréuagxos, and whose vote, added to either of the contesting parties, weighed down the balance, as may appear from Herodotus' account of the Athenian affairs in the Median war. To the same person the command
of the left wing of the army belonged of right.1 But afterwards, it was looked on as unnecessary , and perhaps not very
expedient, that so many generals should be sent with equal power to manage military affairs: wherefore, though the ancient number was elected every year, they were not all obliged to attend the wars ; but one, two,
or more, as occasion required , were despatched to that service : the polem archus was diverted to civil business, and became judge of a court,
where he had cognizance of lawsuits between the natives, or freemen of Athens, and foreigners: the rest of the generals had every man his proper employment; yet none were wholly free from military concerns, but de termined all controversies that happened amongst men of that profession ,2 and ordered all the affairs of war that lay in the city . Hence they came
to be distinguished into two sorts ; one they termed tous êtà añs droix otws, because they administered the city business; the other, Tojstri Tür oraw, from their concern about arms. The latter of these listed and dis
banded soldiers, as there was occasion, and, in short, had the whole
management of war devolved upon them during their continuance in that
post, which seems not to have been long, it being customary for the generals who remained in the city to take their turns of serving in the war."
Tažiagxou were likewise ten, every tribe having the privilege of electing one , and commanded next under the Ergætnyo . They had the care of marshalling the army, gave orders for their marches, and what provisions every soldier should furnish himself with , which were conveyed to the
army by public criers. They had also power to cashier any of the common soldiers, if convicted of misdemeanours. Their jurisdiction was only over the foot.5
' ITTAQXod, were only two in number, and had the chief command of the cavalry next under the Στρατηγοί. ? Þúragzou were ten ; one being nominated by every tribe. They were subordinate officers to the ' ItTagxo , and invested with authority to dis charge horsemen , and to fill up the vacancies, as occasion required .

OF THE MILITARY AFFAIRS OF GREECE . 473
The supreme command was lodged in one person ; for the Lacedæmo nians, however fond of aristocracy in civil affairs, found, by experience,
that in war, a monarchical government was on several accouuts preferable
to all others : ' for it happening, that once upon a difference in opinion between their two kings, Demaratus and Cleomenes, the former withdrew
his part of the army, and left his colleague exposed to the enemy, a law was hereupon enacted , that, for the future, they should never command the army together, as had been usual before that misfortune. Yet upon
extraordinary occasions, when the safety and honour of the state was in dispute, they had so much prudence, as rather, by transgressing the letter
of the law to secure their country, than , by insisting on niceties, to bring it
into danger : for we find that, when Agis was engaged in a dangerous war with the Argians and Mantineans, Plistonax, his fellow -king, having raised an army out of such citizens as by their age were at other times excused from military service, went in person to his assistance . The general's title, as some say, was Bányos, which others will have common to all other military officers. He was ordinarily one of the kings of Sparta ; it being appointed by one of Lycurgus' laws, that this honour
should belong to the kings : bút in cases of necessity, as in their king's minority, a protector, or viceroy, called Ifpódıxos, was substituted for the management of military , as well as civil affairs . It was under this char
acter that Lycurgus reformed and new -modelled the Lacedæmonian polity , and commanded their armięs, during the infancy of king Charilaus." Pausanias also was tutor to Plistarchus, when he led the Lacedæmonians,
and the rest of the Grecians, against Mardonius, Xerxes' lieutenant, at Platæa.?
This only concerned their land -armies ; for the laws made no provision for their fleets, their lawgiver having positively forbidden them to meddiu
with marine affairs. Wherefore, when they became masters of a navy , they confined not their elections of admirals to the royal house, but rather
chose to commit that great trust to their most able and experienced sea men ; as may appear from the instances of Lysander, and several others, who commanded the Spartan fleets, though never invested with royal power. Nor was it ordinarily permitted their kings, when intrusted with
land -armies, to undertake the office of admiral. The only person họji oured with these two commands at the sametime, was the great Agesilaus .
The king, however limited and restrained when at home, was supreme and absolute in the army, it being provided, by a particular precept of the law, that all others should be subordinate to him , and ready to obey his
commands. Notwithstanding this, he was not always left wholly to him self, and the prosecution of his own measures, it being customary for some of the magistrates, called ephori, to accompany him and assist him with

their advice. To these, on some occasions, others were joined. When
Agis had unadvisedly entered into a league with the Argians, at a time when it lay in his power to have forced them to accept of terms far more
honourable to his country, the Spartans highly resented his imprudence, and enacted a decree, that he should never again command an army, without ten counsellors to go along with him. Whether the succeeding
kings were hereby obliged, does not fully appear ; but it seems probable
they were not sent to the wars without a council, consisting, if not of the same, however of a considerable number of the wisest men in Sparta. Agesipolis was attended with no less than thirty ; and though the tender
ness of his age might occasion that extraordinary provision, yet, in wars of great concern or danger, and such as were carried on in remote coun tries, kings of the greatest experience and most eminent for conduct were
not trusted without a great number of counsellors ; for we are told, that Agesilaus himself, when he made his expedition into Asia, was obliged , by a decree of the people, to take thirty along with him . Besides these, the general was guarded by three hundred valiant Spar tans, called ' ITTñes, or horsemen , who fought about his person ,' and were much of the same nature with Romulus' lifeguards, called celeres, or ‘ light-horse,' as Dionysius of Halicarnassus reports. Before him fought all those that had obtained prizes in the sacred games, which was looked
upon as one of the most honourable posts in the army, and esteemed equi valent to all the glorious rewards conferred on these victors in other cities."

than twenty -five. It is sometimes termed orixes , or dexavíc , and its leader Λοχαγός .
Διμοιρία , or: “Ημιλοχία , was a half λόχος ; its leadler Διμοιρίτης , or Ημι λοχίτης..
Συλλογισμός was a conjunction of several λόχοι sometimes it is termed GoTaois, which consisted of four half, or two complete róxos, consisting of thirty -two men.
IliyonzorTagxia , however the name imports only fifty, was usually a double cúrcuois, consisting of four róxon, or sixty -four men ; whence its
leader was not only termed Πεντηκόνταρχος, but Τετράρχης, and for πεντη κονταρχία, we sometimes find τετραρχία .
'Exafortugzív, sometimes called ráğıs, consisted of two of the former, containing a hundred and twenty -eight men. Its commander was an
ciently called Tačiagxos, but afterwards the name of 'Exætóvtagxos gener ally prevailed. To every łzatortagxia were assigned five necessary at tendants, called " Extar701, as not being reckoned in the ranks with the soldiers. These were ,
1. Ergatorýguš, the crier, who conveyed by voice the words of com .
mand . He was usually a man of strong lungs: the most remarkable of any in story was Homer's Stentor, who, he tells us, was able to shout as
loud as any fifty . 2. Enpesuopógos, the ensign, remitted by signs the officer's commands to
the soldiers ; and was of use in conveying things not to be pronounced openly, or discovered, and when the noise of war drowned the crier's voice.
3. SutiYXths, the trumpeter, was necessary , as well to signify to the soldiers the will of their commanders, when dust rendered the two former
useless, as to animate and encourage them , and on several other accounts. 4. 'Tangérns, was a servant that waited on the soldiers, to supply them with necessaries. These four were placed next to the foremost rank.
5. Oupayòs, the lieutenant, brought up the rear, and took care that none of the soldiers were left behind or deserted.
Σύνταγμα, παράταξις , ψιλαγία, and , according to some, ξεναγία , was

Several other numbers are signified by this name, it being frequently taken for the whole body of foot, and as often in gene ral for any company of soldiers. Indeed the Grecian battles were usually
ranged into an order peculiarly termed phalanx ; which was of such strength, that it was able to bear any shock, with what violence soever charged upon them . The Macedonians were the most famous for this
way of embattling; their phalanx is described by Polybius to be a square battalia of pikemen, consisting of sixteen in flank and five hundred in
front; the soldiers standing so close together, that the pikes of the fifth rank were extended three feet beyond the front of the battalia : the rest, whose pikes were not serviceable by reason of their distance from the front, couched them upon the shoulders of those that stood before them ; and so locking them together in file, pressed forward to support and pushi

’ETix M stes páray's represented a half -moon , the wings turned back .
wards, and the main body advanced towards the enemy, or on the con trary. The same was called xugari and noían, being convex and hollow.
'Εσπαρμένη φάλαγξ, when the parts of the battalia stood at an unequal distance from the enemy, some jutting out before others.
'Trigoazáyyois, when both wings were extended beyond the adverse
army's front ; when only one, útsgxégwois. Ρομβοειδής φάλαγξ, called likewise σφηνοειδής, a battalia with four
equal, but not rectangular, sides, representing the figure of a diamond.
This figure was used by the Thessalians, being first contrived by their countryman Jason . Indeed most of the common forms of battalia in
Greece, in Sicily also, and Persia, seem to have been devised after this, or some other square. ” Eußodov, rostrum , or cuneus, was a rhombus divided in the middle,
having three sides, and representing the figure of a wedge, or the letter A. The design of this form was to pierce, and enter forcibly into the enemy's body.
Koivérboros, or forfex , was the cuneus transversed , and wanting the basis ; it represented a pair of sheers, or the letter V ; and seems to have been signed to receive the cuneus.
Claudiov Isbía , laterculus, an army drawn up in the figure of a brick or tile, with four unequal sides ; its length was extended towards the enemy, and exceeded the depth.
Túgyos, turris, was the brick inverted , being an oblong square, after the fashion of a tower, with the small end towards the enemy.?
Ilaíolov had an oblong figure, but approaching nearer to a circle than a quadrangle.
Tiendas was an army extended at length, with a very few men in a rank, when the ways they marched through could not be passed in broader ranks : the name is taken from a worm that insinuates itself into little
holes in wood. On the same account, we find mention of pádzyš noss ons , so ranged, as it were, to pierce through the passages.
TIúrywois pánayyos, was the ranging soldiers close together, so that, whereas in other battalias every man was allowed four cubits space on each side, in this he took up only two.
Evvæoriopòs was closer than the former, one cubit's room being allowed to every soldier : it is so called from bucklers, which were all joined close to one another .
Several other forms of battalia may occur in authors, as those drawn in all the sorts of spherical figures. One of these was called an , first in
vented by Ilion of Thessaly , representing the figure of an egg, into which the Thessalians commonly ranged their horse. It is commonly taken for any party of horse, of what number soever, but sometimes in a more Jimited sense for a troop of sixty - four.

'Erinaexice contained two nas, i. e, one hundred and twenty -eight. Tapartindegríc was a duplicate of the former, consisting of two hundred
and fifty -six ; for they commonly used a sort of horsemen called Tagartão vat, or irraywotai, who annoyed their enemies with missive weapons,
being unable to sustain a close fight by reason of their light armour, There was likewise another sort of Tarentine horsemen , who, having dis charged their missive weapons, engaged their enemies in close fight. Their name was derived from Tarentum in Italy, which used to furnish
out horsemen of these sorts : but whether the name of this troop was taken from the sort of horsemen , or the numbers being the same with that used

a

turn
to
the

hand
,
whereby
their
backs
were

on
what
before
lay

faces
.
There
were
two
sorts
of
it
:
1. Metabonn is ovgày, whereby they turned from front to rear , which
is termed opà, so that their backs were toward their enemies ; whence it is called μεταβολή από των πολεμίων. It was always effected by turning to the right.
2. Msraßorin år' ovpãs, or Štà modelw, from rear to front, whereby they turned their faces to their enemies, by moving twice to the left.
’Eriotgoon, when the whole battalion , close joined man to man , made one turn either to the right or left.
' Αναστροφή is opposed to επιστροφή , being the return of such a battalion to its former station .
Περισπασμός , a double επιστροφή, whereby their backs were turned to the place of their faces, the front being transferred to the place of the
rear
.
'Extilioruopos, a treble iruotpoon, or three wheelings. Είς ορθόν αποδούναι, or επ ' ορθόν αποκαταστήσαι, to turn about to the places they were in at first.
’Eğeasymeòs, ' Egidiomes , or 'Egiaužus, countermarch, whereby every soldier, one marching after another, changed the front for the rear, or one flank for another ; whence there are two sorts of countermarches, xard
rózous, and nurà Guy', one by files, the other by ranks; both are farther divided into three sorts :
1. Εξελιγμός Μακεδών κατά λόχους, invented by the Macedonians , was thus: first, the leaders of the files turned to the right or left about; then the next rank passed through by them on the same hand, and being come
into the distant spaces, placed themselves behind the leaders of their files, then turned about their faces the same way . In like manner the third
rank after them , with the fourth , and all the rest, till the bringers up were last, and had turned about their faces, and again taken the rear of the battle. Hereby the army was removed into the ground before the front,
and the faces of the soldiers turned backward. This appeared like a re treat, and was for that reason laid aside by Philip of Macedon, who used
the following motion in its stead : 2. ' Egeasypós sáxw xatà nózous, invented by the Lacedæmonians, was
contrary to the former; that took up the ground before the phalanx, this
the ground behind it, and the soldiers' faces turned the contrary way : in that the motion was from rear to front, in this from front to rear. Ælian '
describes it two ways; one was, when the bringers up first turned about
their faces, the next rank likewise turning their faces, began the counter march, every man placing himself directly before his bringer up ; the

.
third did the like, and so the rest, till the rank and file leaders were first. The other method was when the leaders of files began the counter march, every one in their files following them orderly ; hereby they were brought nearer to their enemies, and represented a charge.
3. Εξελιγμός Περσικός, οι Κρητικός, κατά λόχους, was used by the Per
sians and Cretans ; it was sometimes termed ogsãos , because managed like the Grecian Chori, which, being ordered into files and ranks, like soldiers in battle -array, and moving forward towards the brink of the stage, when they could pass no further, retired , one through the ranks of another; the whole chorus all the time maintaining the same space of ground they were before possessed of ; wherein this countermarch differed from the two
former, in both which the phalanx changed its place.
' Egeogpos xatà suyà, countermarch by rank, was contrary to counter march by file : in the countermarch by file, the motion was in the depth of the battalia, the front moving toward the rear, or the rear toward the front, and succeeding into each other's place; in this the motion was in length of the battalia flank -wise , the wing either marching into the midst,
or quite through to the opposite wing ; in doing this, the soldiers that stood last in the flank of the wing moved first to the contrary wing, the
rest of every rank following in their order. It was likewise performed
three
ways
:
1. The Macedonian countermarch began its motion at the corner of the
wing nearest the enemies, upon their appearing at either flank , and re moved to the ground on the side of the contrary wing, so resembling a
flight. 2. The Lacedæmonian countermarch , beginning its motions in the wing
farthest distant from the enemy, seized the ground nearest to them , whereby an onset was represented.
3.
The
Chorean
countermarch
maintained
its
own
ground
,
only
remov
ing
one
wing
into
the
other's
place
.
Athaorkou is to double or increase the battalia, which was effected two ways. Sometimes the number of their men was augmented , remaining
still upon the same space of ground ; sometimes the soldiers, continuing the same in number, were so drawn out by thinning their ranks, or files, that they took up a much larger space than before. Both these augmen tations of men, or ground, being made either in length or depth, occa sioned four sorts of ditimolaouoi, which were made by counter marches :
1. Διπλασιασμός ανδρών κατά ζυγά, οι κατά μήκος , when fresh men were inserted into ranks, the length of the battalia being still the same,
but the soldiers drawn up closer and thicker than before.
2. Διπλασιασμός ανδρών κατά λόχους, or κατά βάθος, was when the files were doubled, their ground being of no larger extent than before, by rang ing them close to one another.

the battalia was increased , without the accession of new forces, by placing the soldiers at greater distances from one another. 4. Διπλασιασμός τόπου κατά λόχους, or κατά βάθος , when the deptll of

To conclude this chapter, it may be observed , that the Greeks were excellently skilled in the method of embattling armies ; and maintained
public professors, called Taxtıxoì, from ráorsiv, who exercised the youth
in this art, and rendered them expert in all the forms of battle, before they adventured into the field .
CHAP. VII.
OF THEIR MANNER OF MAKING PEACE AND DECLARING WAR, THEIR
AMBASSADORS, &c.
BEFORE the Greeks engaged in war, it was usual to publish a declaration of the injuries they had received , and to demand satisfaction by ambassa
dors ; for, however prepared or excellently skilled they were in the affairs of war, yet peace, if to be procured upon honourable terms, was thought more
eligible. This custom was observed even in the most early ages, as ap pears from the story of Tydeus, when Polynices was sent to compose matters with his brother Eteocles, king of Thebes, before he proceeded to invest . that city. Nor was the Trojan war prosecuted with so great hazard and Joss to both parties, till these means proved ineffectual; for we learn from Homer that Ulysses and Menelaus were despatched on an embassy to
Troy, to demand restitution. The same poet in another place, acquaints us, that their proposal was rejected by the Trojans, overruled by Anti machus, a person of great repute amongst them , whom Paris had engaged in his party by a large sum of money.2 Invasions without notice were looked on rather as robberies than lawful
wars, as designed rather to spoil and make a prey of persons innocent and unprovided , than to repair any losses or damages sustained, which, for aught the invaders knew , might have been satisfied for in an easier way. It is therefore no wonder that the Ætolians 3 were accounted the common
outlaws and robbers of Greece ; it being their manner to strike without warning, and to make war without any previous and public declaration , whenever they had opportunity of enriching themselves with the spoil and booty of their neighbours. Yet there are not wanting instances of wars begun without previous notice, even by nations of better repute for justice
and humanity ; but this was only done upon provocations so great and ex asperating, that no recompense was thought sufficient to atone for them ; 3 Polyb. iv.

whence it came to pass, that such wars were, of all others, the most bloody and pernicious, and were fought with excess of rage and fury ; the con testing parties being resolved, if possible, to extirpate each other .
Ambassadors were usually persons of great worth or eminent station , that, by their quality and deportment, they might command respect and
attention from their very enemies: and what injuries or affronts soever had been committed , yet ambassadors were held sacred by all sides . Gods and men were thought to be concerned to prosecute, with the utmost ven geance , all injuries done to them ; whence, to omit several other instances, we read, that the Lacedæmonians having inhumanly murdered the ambas
sadors of Xerxes, the gods would accept none of their oblations and sacri fices, which were all found polluted with direful omens, till two noblemen
of Sparta were sent as an expiatory sacrifice to Xerxes, to atone for the death of his ambassadors by their own. That emperor, indeed, gave them
leave to return in safety, without any other ignominy than what they suf fered by a severe reflection on the Spartan nation, whose barbarous cruelty he professed he would not imitate, however provoked by them ; yet divine
vengeance suffered them not to go unpunished, but inflicted , what those men had assumed to themselves, upon their sons, who, being sent on an em
bassy into Asia, were betrayed into the hands of the Athenians, and by them put to death : which ñy author concludes to have been a just revenge from heaven for the Lacedæmonian cruelty .
Whence this holiness was conferred upon ambassadors, has been matter of dispute ; fabulous authors deduce it from the honour paid by the ancients
to the supuxes, or heralds, who were either themselves ambassadors, or when others were deputed to that service, accompanied them, being held sacred on the account of their origin, because descended from Ceryx, the son of Mercury , who was honoured with the same employment in heaven these obtained upon earth . It is true, that these men were ever had in great esteem , and their persons held sacred and inviolable ; whence, as
Eustathius observes, Ulysses in Homer, when cast upon foreign and un known coasts, usually sends a herald to protect the men deputed to make
discovery of the country and its inhabitants, persons of that character being reverenced even in barbarous nations, except some few , such as the Læs
trygones, or Cyclopes, in whom all sense of humanity was extinguished.” They were likewise under the care and protection of Mercury, the presid ing god of their occupation , and Jupiter;: whence Achilles calls them the messengers, not of men only, but of Jupiter. But these honours seem
to have been conferred upon them not so much because they were de scended from Mercury ( several other families to whom no such respect was
due bearing themselves much higher on account of their origin ), as upon account of their office, which being common to them with other ambassa
dors, seems to have challenged an equal reverence to both. Licens ,

indeed, being once granted to treat persons of that character injuriously,
all hopes of peace and reconciliation amongst enemies must be banished for ever out of the world , and therefore, in the most rude and unpolished
ages, all sorts of ambassadors were civilly entertained, and dismissed with safety: whence Tydeus' lady in Statius ? is prevailed with to let her hus band go ambassador to Thebes, because that title would afford him pro tection in the midst of his enemies.
The Athenian heralds were all of one family, being descended from
Ceryx the son of Mercury, and Pandrosus daughter to Cecrops king of Athens.
The Lacedæmonian heralds were all descended from Talthybius,
Agamemnon's herald , who was honoured with a temple, and divine wor ship, at Sparta.2
They carried in their hands a staff of laurel or olive, called rnpúriav, round which two serpents, without their crests erected , were folded , as an emblem of peace and concord . Instead of this, the Athenian heralds
frequently made use of the Eicsorávn, which was a token of peace and plenty, being an olive branch covered with wool, and adorned with all sorts of fruits of the earth .
Kúgurss, heralds, are by some thought to differ from egéobus, ambas
sadors, in this ; that ambassadors were employed in treaties of peace, whereas heralds were sent to declare war :4 but this distinction is not con
stant or perpetual, the rúguzes being frequently taken for persons commis sioned to treat about accommodating differences, which may appear, both
from some of the fore- cited places of Eustathius, and from several passages in Homer and other authors .
Ambassadors were of two sorts, being either sent with a limited com mission, which they were not to exceed, or invested with full power of determining matters according to their own discretion . The former were
liable to be called in question for their proceedings ; the latter were sul)
act to no after -reckoning, but were wholly their own masters, and for that reason styled nesoßers aútorpátoges, plenipotentiaries." It may be observed, that the Lacedæmonians, as in most other things their customs were different from the rest of the Greeks, so likewise in
their choice of ambassadors, had this peculiarity, that for the most part they deputed men between whom there was no very good correspondence ;
supposing it most improbable that such persons should so far trust one an other, as to conspire together against the commonwealth . For the same reason , it was thought a piece of policy in that state to raise dissensions between their kings.6
Their leagues were of three sorts. 1. A bare oTivon, ouvbhun, sighun , a peace, whereby both parties were obliged to cease fro all acts of hos
tility, and neither to molest one another , nor the confederates of either .

2. 'Eropezxia , whereby they obliged themselves to assist one another in case they should be invaded . 3. Eupeface xia , whereby they covenanted to assist one another as well
when they made invasions upon others, as when themselves were invaded, and to have the same friends and enemies ."
All these covenants were solemnly confirmed by mutual oaths :? and
that the parties might lie under a greater obligation to preserve them in violate, we find it customary to engrave them upon tables, which they fixed up at places of general concourse, that all the world might be witnesses
of their justice and fidelity. Thus we find the articles of treaty between Athens and Sparta not only published in those cities, but at the places
where the Olympian, Pythian , and Isthmian games were celebrated .* Others exchanged certain tessere , in Greek cúpBoda , which might be produced on any occasion as evidences of the agreement. The covenant
itself was also called by the same name.* Farther, to continue the re
membrance of mutual agreements fresh in their minds, it was not uncom mon for states thus united , interchangeably to send ambassadors, who, on
some appointed day, when the people assembled in great numbers, should
openly repeat, and by mutual consent confirm their former treaty. This we find practised by the Athenians and Spartans after their fore -mentioned league, the Spartan ambassadors presenting themselves at Athens upon the festival of Bacchus, and the Athenians at Sparta on the festival of Hyacinthus. Their manner of declaring war was to send a herald, who bade the persons who had injured them to prepare for an invasion , and sometimes, in token of defiance, cast a spear towards them. The Athenians fre
quently let loose a lamb into their enemies' territories ; signifying there by, that what was then a habitation for men should be laid waste and deso
late, and become a pasture for sheep . Hence ägva trobárası came to
be a proverbial phrase for entering into a state of war.

.?
After all these preparations, though the posture of affairs appeared never
so inviting, it was held no less impious than dangerous to march against their enemies till the season favoured their enterprise ; for being extremely
superstitious in the observation of omens and days, till those became for tunate, they durst not make any attempts upon their enemies. An eclipse of the moon , or any other of those they esteemed unlucky accidents, was enough to deter them from marching: and if all other things promised success, yet they deferred their expedition till one of the days they looked on as fortunate invited them to it. The Athenians could not be persuaded to
march évtès éßdóuns, before the seventh ;3 which gave occasion to the pro verb, whereby persons who undertook any business unseasonably , and
before the proper time, were said to do it fyròs idógens . But the Lace dæmonians were of all others the most nice and scrupulous in these obser
vations; their lawgiver having commanded them to pay a critical and in violate obedience to the celestial predictions, and to regulate all their pro ceedings, as well in civil as military aflairs, by the appearance of the hea
venly bodies ; amongst the rest they were obliged , by a particular precept, never to march before the full moon ;" for that planet was believed to have a particular influence upon their affairs, to bless them with success, when itself was in the height of its splendour, but till it was arrived there, to neglect, or suffer them to be blasted for want of power to send assistance. So constant a belief of this they had entertained, that the greatest neces
sity could not prevail upon them to alter their measures ; for, when the Athenians were in danger of falling into the hands of Darius, and sent to implore their assistance, they agreed indeed to send them a supply of men , but, rather than march before full moon, forced them to run the hazard of
a decisive battle, and with a very small force to encounter a huudred thou sand Medians .

CHAP. VIII.
OF THEIR CAMPS, GUARDS, WATCHES, AND MILITARY COURSE OF LIFE,
Or the form of the Grecian camps nothing exact and constant can be delivered , that being not always the same, but varied, as the custom or
humour of different states, or the conveniences of place and time required.
The Lacedæmonians, indeed, are said to have been prescribed a constant method of building towns and encamping, by their lawgiver, who thought a spherical figure the best fitted for defence ;' which was contrary to the custom of the Romans, whose camps were quadrangular: but all forms of that sort were rejected by Lycurgus, the angles being neither fit for ser
vice, nor defensible, unless guarded by a river, mountain , wall, or some such fortification . It is farther observable of the Lacedæmonians, that
they frequently moved their camps, being accustomed vigorously to prose
cute all their enterprises, impatient of delays and tedious procrastinations, and utterly averse from passing their time without action ; wherefore the
reason of this being demanded of Lycurgus, he replied , “ it was that they might do greater damage to their enemies." To which Xenophon adds a second, that they might give more early relief to their friends.*3
Of the rest of the Grecian camps it may be observed, that the most
valiant of the soldiers were placed at the extremities, the rest in the mid dle ; that the stronger might be a guard to the weaker, and sustain the
first onsets, if the enemy should endeavour to force their entrenchments. Thus, we find Achilles and Ajax posted at the ends of the Grecian camp before Troy, as bulwarks on each side of the other princes, who had their tents in the middle .4
When they designed to continue long in their encampments , they con trived a place where altars were erected to the gods, and all parts of divine
service solemnly performed : in the same place public assemblies were called together, when the general had any thing to communicate to his soldiers; and courts of justice were held , wherein all controversies among
the soldiers were decided , and criminals sentenced to punishment: this
custom was as ancient as the Trojan war , and is mentioned by Homer . When they were in danger of having their camp attacked, it was usual
to fortify it with a trench and rampart, or wall, ou the sides of which they
erected turrets not unlike those upon the walls of cities, out of which they annoyed their enemies with massive weapons. Thus, the Grecians in Homer were forced to defend themselves in the ninth year of the Trojan war, when Achilles refused to assist them : whereas, till that time, they had wanted fortifications, bu immured the Trojans within their own walls ..

OF THE MILITARY AFFAIRS OF GREECE . 489
The manner of living in camps depended upon the disposition of their generals, some of which allowed their soldiers all sorts of excess and de bauchery ; others obliged them to the strictest rules of temperance and
sobriety ; a remarkable instance whereof we have in Philip of Macedon , who, as Polybius reports, condemned two of his soldiers to banishment for no other offence , than because he had found them with a singing -woman
in his camp. But the Grecian discipline was not always so severe and and rigid, as may appear from Plutarch, who tells us that the Lacedæ monians alone, of all the Greeks, had no stage- players, no jugglers, no
dancing or singing -women attending them , but were free from all sorts of debauchery and looseness, of gaudy pomp and foppery ; the young men ,
when commanded nothing by their general, were always employed in
some exercise or manly study ; the old were busied in giving instructions, or receiving them from persons more skilful than themselves ; and their leisure hours were diverted with their usual drollery, and rallying one an
other facetiously after the Laconic fashion : yet their lawgiver allowed them greater liberty in the camp than at other times, to invite them to
serve with delight in the wars ; for whilst they were in the field, their
exercises were more moderate than at home, their fare not so hard, nor so strict a hand kept over them by their governors ; so that they were the only people in the world to whom war gave repose. They were likewise
allowed to have costly arms and fine clothes, and frequently perfumed themselves and curled their hair : whence we read, that Xerxes was
struck with admiration , when the scouts brought him word, the Laceda monian guards were at gymnical sports, and curling their hair. It was also customary at Athens for horsemen to nourish their hair. The cus
tom seems to have been derived from the primitive times, there being scarce any expression so frequent in Homer as that of xagnuopówytis ' Ayaso. Afterwards, Cyneas and Phrynus, besides several other changes
in the Athenian discipline of soldiers, procured a law to be enacted, which forbade them και αβροδιαίτους είναι • to nourish their hair and to live delicately .
Their guards may be distinguished into Φυλακαι ημεριναι and νυκτεριναί the first were upon duty by day, the other by night. At several hours in the night, certain officers called Figironos, did regitoasiv, walk round the camp, and visit the watch ; to try whether any of them were asleep,
they had a little bell, termed xúòwy, at the sound of which the soldiers
were to answer :5 whence, to go this circuit, was called xwdwrigsv, and zwdwro@ optie.

dúvotos for érzipuotos, untried, or unproved . This custom furnished Brasidas with an advantage against Potidæa in the Peloponnesian war : for
having observed the sounding of the bell to be over , he took his opportu nity , before the bell's return , to set up ladders in an unguarded place of the wall, and so entered the city. The Lacedæmonian watch were not permitted to have their bucklers,
that, being unable to defend themselves, they might be more cautious how they fell asleep.3
The rest of the Spartan soldiers were obliged to take their rest armed , that they might be prepared for battle upon any alarm .*
It may be farther observed of the Spartans, that they kept a double watch : one within their camp, to observe their allies, lest they should make a sudden defection ; the other upon some eminence, or other place,
whence there was a good prospect, to watch the motions of their ene mies,5
How often the guards were relieved doth not appear ; as neither whether
it was done at set and constant times, or according to the commander's pleasure; Quadxn, indeed , which signifies a watch , is frequently taken for the fourth part of the night, answering to the Roman vigilia , as appears
from several places of the New Testament, as well as other authors. But it seems to have this signification rather from the Roman than the Gre
cian watches, those being changed four times every night, that is, every third hour, computing the night from six to six, or rather from sun to
sun, for the time between the two suns was divided into twelve equal parts, which were not always the same, like our hours, but greater or less,
according to the season of the year : and are therefore, by astronomers, termed unequal and planetary hours.

Before they joined battle, the soldiers always refreshed themselves with victuals, eating and drinking plentifully : of this custom , with its reasons,
Homer gives a full account in the elegant oration of Ulysses to Achil
les, where he advises the young general by no means to lead out his army fasting. The Romans also thought this a preparative absolutely neces
sary , and never omitted it before engagements.?

that

up

an

At this time the general made an oration to his soldiers, in which he exhorted them , with all the motives suitable on such occasions, to exert their utmost force and vigour against the enemy : and so wonderful was the success that attended these performances, that many times when affairs
were in a declining and almost desperate condition, the soldiers, animated with fresh life and courage, have instantly retrieved them, and repulsed those very enemies by whom themselves had before been defeated : several
of these instances may be found in the Grecian and Roman histories, few of which are more remarkable than that of Tyrtæus, the lame Athenian
poet, to whom the command of the Spartan army was given by the advice of an oracle in one of the Messenian wars : the Spartans had at that time suffered great losses in many encounters, and all their stratagems had proved ineffectual, so that they began to despair almost of success, when
the poet, by his lectures of honour and courage, delivered in moving verse to the army, ravished them to such a degree with the thoughts of dying for their country, that, rushing on with a furious transport to meet their enemies, they gave them an entire overthrow , and by one decisive battle
put a happy conclusion to the war.3
Before they ventured to meet the enemy, they endeavoured by prayers, sacrifices, and vows, to engage heaven to their assistence ; and they sang
a hymn to Mars, called fanden iußarúgos, as that sung to Apollo after a prosperous battle was termed παιάν επινίκιος.4 The Lacedaemonians had
a peculiar custom of sacrificing to the Muses, which was either designed to soften and mollify their passionate transports, it being their custom to

enter the battle calm and sedate, or to animate them to perform noble
and heroic exploits, deserving to be transmitted by those goddesses to posterity. The soothsayers inspected all the sacrifices, to presage the
success of the battle ; and, till the omens proved favourable, they rather chose tamely to resign their lives to the enemy than to defend themselves. The Spartans, especially , were above measure addicted to this supersti. tion : for, in the famous battle at Platæa, when Mardonius, the Persian general, had fallen upon the Grecians, Pausanias the Spartan , who at that time commanded the Grecian army, offering sacrifice, found it not accepta
bie to the gods, and thereupon commanded his Lacedæmonians, laying down their bucklers at their feet, patiently to abide his commands ; the
priests offered one sacrifice after another, but all without success, the bar barians all the time charging upon them, and wounding and slaying them in their ranks, till at length Pausanias, turning himself towards the tem
ple, with hands lifted up to heaven, and tears in his eyes, besought Juno of Cithæron , and the rest of the tutelary deities of the Platæans, that if the Fates would not favour the Greeks with victory, they would grant at
least, that by some remarkable exploit they might demonstrate to their enemies that they waged war with men of true courage and bravery.
These prayers were no sooner finished than the sacrifices appeared propi tious, the signal was given, and they fell with such resolution upon the Persians, that in a short time they entirely defeated their whole army.
Their signals are commonly divided into cúpebord, and onusia, which words sometimes indeed are used promiscuously, but in propriety of speech
are distinguished ,
Púpborce, were of two kinds, either owiną , or ógætà, i. e. pronounced by the mouth, or visible to the eye. The first are termed ourlhueta , the latter παρασυνθήματα..
Súvónuce, in Latin tessera , the word, communicated by the general to the subordinate officers, by them to the whole army, as a mark of distinc tion to know friends from enemies. It commonly contained some good
omen , or the name of some deity worshipped by their country or general,
and from whom they expected success in their enterprises. Cyrus, for example, used Ziùs oupesca xos, üyekcin, or owthg ; Cæsar, Venus genetrir ; Augustus, Apollo:7 but this custom often proved of fatal and pernicious
consequence ; for by frequently questioning one another, they bred con fusion among themselves, and, which was no less dangerous, discovered the word to the enemies ; as we find happening in the fight between the Athenians and the Syracusans, spoken of by Thucydides ;& it became like wise the occasion of several mischievous stratagems, one of which we find
practised by an Arcadian captain in a war with Lacedæmon ; when en gaging in the night, all the tessera he gave his soldiers was, that they should forthwith kill whoever demanded the word ; whereby they easily

distinguished and slew the Spartans, themselves being undiscovered, and
therefore secure ,1 Ilapaoúvénece was a visible character of distinction , as nodding their
heads, waving their hands, clashing their weapons, or such like .? Emusic were ensigns, or flags, the elevation whereof was a signal to join battle, the depression to desist. Of these there were different sorts,
several of which were adorned with images of animals, or other things bearing peculiar relations to the cities they belonged to : the Athenians, for instance, bore an owl in their ensigns,4 as being sacred to Minerva, the protectress of their city ; the Thebans a sphinx, in memory of the famous monster overcome by Edipus. The Persians paid divine honours
to the sun, and therefore represented him in their ensigns .
The onusion was frequently a purple coat upon the top of a spear, as appears from Conon's in Polyænus, and Cleomenes' in Plutarch : nor was it uncommon to use other colours; Polybius, speaking of the fight between
Antigonus and Cleomenes,? tells us that the Illyrians, having orders to begin the battle, were to receive a signal by a white flag, that should be
spread from the nearest post to Olympus ; but the signal to be given by the Megalopolitans and the cavalry was a purple coat, which was to be
advanced in the air where Antigonus himself was posted .' The ancient Grecian signals were lighted torches thrown from both
armies by men called πυρφόροι, or πυροφόροι , who were priests of Mars, and therefore held inviolable ; and having cast their torches , had safe re gress :8 whence of battles fought with transport of fury, wherein no quar ter was given , it was usual to say oud' ó fuppógos tocón, not so much as a torch -bearer escaped. To this custom there are frequent allusions in Greek and Latin poets. 9 These being laid aside, shells of fishes succeeded, which they sounded
in the manner of trumpets, which in those days were not invented.10
Hence Theognis' riddle may easily be interpreted :
"Ηδη γάρ μεκέκληκε θαλάττιος οίκαδε νεκρός,, A spa inhabitant, with living mouth , Τεθνηκώς ζωω φθεγγόμενος στοματι.. Spoke to me to go home, though it was dead .
Triton's shell -trumpet is famous in poetical story.11 And most of the poets mention this custom in their description of the primitive wars. 12
Thus Lycophron , speaking of the Trojan war : 13 Και δη καταίθει γαίαν ορχηστής " Αρης , Twining and circling into various rounds;
Στρόμβω τον αιματηρόν εξάρχων νόμον . Thus was the land laid waste, thus rag'd the fi ry
Great Mars, that nimble god of war, god , Invigorates the youth by sound of shell, Where, though the scholiast falls foul upon the poet for introducing shells at a time when trumpets were in use , which he tells us may be made appear from Homer ; yet in this he seems to be too audacious, for it

is observable, that, though Homer mentions trumpets, they never make any part of the description of his heroic battles, but only furnish him
with a simile, or allusion . Whence it may be presumed, that trumpets were indeed used in Homer's time, but were then only a late invention, and not so ancient as the Trojan war . Virgil indeed appears to give some countenance to Tzetzes' opinion , when he speaks of Misenus, whom he makes to have served Hector in the Trojan war, and afterwards Æneas, in the office of a trumpeter . But, in the passage referred to, the brazen
trumpet and lituus are taken from the practice of the poet's own age, by a figure familiar to men of his profession ; for. Misenus was never acquainted with so rare a contrivance ; and though we find him so proud of his art, as to challenge the gods of the sea, yet it was not to a contention on the trumpet, but on a shell, the instrument used by these deities : whence the
same poet, who may be supposed to be the best interpreter of his own
words, speaks thus : Sed tum forte, cava dum personat æquora concha But while the daring mortal, o'er the flood, Demens, et cantu vocat in certamina divos,

There were six several sorts of trumpets,6 and hence the disagreement in ancient writers concerning the first author of the invention ; it being common for them to ascribe to the inventor of any one sort, the honour of the first contrivance .
1. The first trumpet was contrived by Minerva, the patroness of almost all arts and useful inventions ; and hence she was honoured with the title
of záa uyğ.? Under this name she was worshipped in a temple dedicated to her at Argos :S but Pausanias is rather of opinion that this trumpet was
the invention of Tyrrhenus, one of the sons of Hercules, whose son Hege laus (having communicated it to a party of Dorians, the subjects of Te
menus) in memory of the invention, and from gratitude to the goddess,
gave her this surname. 2. The second was the Egyptian trumpet, called xvoún, the contrivance of Osiris : it was round , and was used at sacrifices to call the people together. I

time with their feet to the music, as was their custom. This answer is
indeed facetious, and not wholly without truth, yet seems not fully to com prehend the design of this custom . Valerius Maximus is yet farther from the truth, and stands in direct opposition to it, when he supposes it in
tended to raise the courage of the soldiers, that they might begin the onset with greater violence and fury ; for Thucydides, with whom the rest of the ancient historians agree , assures us that the design of it was rather to render them cool and sedate, trumpets and other instruments being more
proper to inspire with heat and rage ; but these passions they thought rather apt to beget disorder and confusion , than to produce any noble and memorable actions, valour being not the effect of a sudden and vanishing transport, but proceeding from a settled and habitual firmness and con
stancy of mind ; wherefore they endeavoured , not with noise and haste, but with composed minds and settled countenances, to advance in a majestic and deliberate pace towards their enemies. “ The army being drawn up in battle -array, and the enemy near, the king sacrificed a she goat, and at the same time commanded the soldiers to adorn their heads
with garlands, and the musicians to play on the flutes Karrógssy péros, the tune of Castor's hymn ; and himself, advancing forward , began the šußarúgos rusày, or alarm ; so that it was at once a delightful and terrible sight to see them march on , keeping pace to the tune of their flutes, with out ever troubling their order, or confounding their ranks, their music
leading them into danger cheerful and unconcerned : for men thus dis
posed were not likely to be possessed with fear, or transported with fury ; but they proceeded with a deliberate valour, full of hope and good assur ance, as if some divinity had sensibly assisted them .' Maximus the Ty rian attributes to this method those great successes, and numerous victories, which have rendered the Spartan name famous in all succeeding ages ; but
it seems peculiarly calculated and adapted to the discipline and temper of that state, and scarcely ever to be imitated, till the old Lacedæmonian
resolution and unparalleled firmness of mind shall be recalled. The rest of the Greeks advanced with eager haste and fury , and in the
beginning of their onset gave a general shout, to encourage and animate themselves, and strike terror into their enemies : this was called úraray . mòs, from the soldiers repeating áraná. Suidas makes them to have cried also laasū. The first author of this shout was Pan , the lieutenant- general of Baechus in his Indian expedition ; where, being encompassed in a
valley with an army far superior in number, he advised the god to order his men in the night to give a general shout, which so surprised the oppo site

he

it

In the wars of the heroic ages, generals fought at the head of their
armies, as appears in all Homer's battles ; whence they are frequently termed πρόμαχοι and πρόμοι , because they did προμαχίζεις τη στρατώ, fight before their armies. Thus, when he led up the Trojans :? Τρωσιν μεν προμαχίζειν Αλέξανδρος θεοειδής. Leading the Trojans godlike Paris fought.
And when Achilles sends out his soldiers to defend the Grecian ships, having allotted to the rest of his officers their several posts, he places Pa troclus and Automedon, as chief commanders, before the front:S Πάντων δε προπάροιθε δύο ανόρε 9ωρήσσεσθον,, In front of all, two chiefs their station took , Πάτροκλός τε, και Αυτομέδων, ένα θυμόν έχοντες, Patroclus and Automedon ; one mind Πρόσθεν Μυρμιδόνων πολεμιζόμεν.. In both prevail'd, to combat in the van Of all the Myrmidons.
In wiser ages, this practice was laid aside, and generals, considering how much the event of the battle depended upon the preservation of their persons, usually chose safer posts, and were more cautious how they ventured themselves into danger.

The retreat, and other commands, seem usually to have been sounded on the same instrument with which the alarm was given ; yet in those places where the alarm was sounded by soft and gentle music, the retreat
and other orders were sometimes signified upon louder instruments : which may be observed of the Lacedæmonians, who seem to have used trumpets
in signifying the general's orders, as appears from Polybius,' who reports that Cleomenes commanded a division of his army to change their posts by sound of trumpet.

It was frequent among the ancient Greeks to put their cause upon the issue of a single combat, and to decide their quarrels by two or more
champions on each side : and their kings and great commanders were so eager in their pursuit after glory, and so tender of the lives of their sub
jects, that they frequently sent challenges to their rival princes, to end their quarrel by a single encounter, that by the death of one of them they might prevent the effusion of more blood. Remarkable instances of this
we have in Xanthus, king of Boeotia, who, challenging the king of Attica, was slain by him, and so ended a dangerous war between those states ;)
and in Pittacus, the famous Mitylenian , who slew Phryno the Athenian general in a single combat. Ancient histories are full of such examples, as likewise of wars happily concluded by a small number commissioned by mutual agreement to decide the controversy. The Lacedæmonians furnish
us with one memorable instance in their wars with Argos about the title to Thyrea, which was determined by three hundred on each side. Nor 1 Lib. ii. prope finem .

OF THEIR SIEGES AND ENGINES USED THEREIN .
THERE are no traces of any siege among the primitive Greeks: their cities were not fortified with walls, but lay open to all invaders; and their inha
bitants, once vanquished in open field, became an easy prey to the con querors. Wherefore, it is not to be wondered that the people of those times enjoyed no fixed and settled habitations, but frequently removed
from one part of the country to another, being forced to quit their seats
whenever they were coveted by a power superior to their own . This moving and unsettled condition, in which they continued for some ages, caused them to attempt several methods to secure themselves: some
built their cities upon the tops of inaccessible rocks and mountains, whence they could easily repel a greater force of enemies : others, whose situation
was not so defensible, were driven to seek other ways for their safety ; till at length, some heads of no vulgar understanding brought forth an amazing contrivance to inclose their houses and possessions within walls. This, at
first, was looked on as a work so wonderful, so far above human capacity, that the gods were frequently called from their blessed mansions to under take it. The walls of Troy, to mention no more , were of divine work manship, and raised by no meaner persons than Neptune and Apollo: but if mortals had the happiness to project and finish so great a design , they seldom failed of being translated to heaven , and having their names en rolled among those exalted beings, to whom they were thought to make near approaches whilst on earth .
And, since it was their custom to immortalize the first author of every
little contrivance, it is no wonder that they conferred the same honours on those great benefactors, to whom they were indebted for the security and quiet possession of whatever the rest of their deities had gratified them
with . Once, indeed, inclosed within walls, they looked upon themselves as safe from all assaults ; and, had not a weak opposition within been suf
ficient to repel much greater forces of invaders, such a town as Troy

could never have held out ten years against a hundred thousand be siegers.
Nor were the Greeks of later ages, however renowned for knowledge in military affairs, very willing to undertake, or expert in managing sieges ; but rather chose to end their quarrels, if possible, by one decisive battle, than to undergo the fatigue and other incommodities of so tedious, so dangerous, and expensive a method.
Of all the Greeks, the most averse from undertaking sieges, and the most unskilful in carrying them on to advantage , were the Lacedæ monians ; insomuch, that after the defeat of Mardonius at Platæa, when a
body of Persians had taken refuge in some wooden fortifications, they could find no means to drive them thence , but must have been forced to retire, had not the Athenians and some other Greeks advanced to their assist
ance.! Indeed their lawgiver obliged them, by a special injunction, not easily to engage in besieging towns ; and to lose their lives in such under
takings was accounted inglorious, and unworthy a Spartan ; thus Plutarch, speaking of Lysander's being slain before the gates of a little Boeotian
town , called Haliartus, tells us, “ That, like some common soldier, or one
of the forlorn hope, he cast away his life ingloriously , giving testimony to the ancient Spartans that they did well to avoid storming of walls, where the stoutest man may chance to fall by the hand, not only of an abject fel. low , but of a boy or woman : as they say Achilles was slain by Paris at the Scæan gate of Troy.3 Pyrrhus also, the great king of Epirus, fell by the hand of a woman at Argos . When they endeavoured to possess themselves of a town or castle, it was usual first to attempt it by storm, surrounding it with their whole army, and attacking it in all quarters at once, which the Greeks called
o'mynveveiv, the Romans, corona cingere. When this method proved inef fectual, they frequently desisted from their enterprise ; but if resolved to
prosecute it, they prepared for a larger siege ; in carrying on which, they seem not to have proceeded in any constant and settled method, but to
have varied it according to the direction of their generals, as well as the difference in time, place, and other circumstances.
When they designed to lay close siege to a place, the first thing they
vent about was αποτειχισμός , Or περιτειχισμός , the works of circumvalla tion, which we find sometimes to have consisted of a double wall or ram
part, raised up of turfs, called in Greek saívbo and shovdía , in Latin ces pites. The interior fortification was designed to prevent sudden and
unexpected sallies from the town, and to deprive it of all possibility of succour from without ; the exterior, to secure them from foreign enemies that might come to the relief of the besieged. Thus, when the Pelopon nesians invested Platæa, they raised a double wall, one towards the city, the other towards Athens, to prevent all danger on that side : the middle

space, which was sixteen feet, was occupied with lodges for guards and
sentinels, built at due distance one from another, yet so close, that at a distant view the whole pile appeared to be one broad wall, with turrets on both sides, after every tenth of which was a larger tower, extending from wall to wall,
Engines were called by the ancient Greeks jáyyava, and afterwards
Hemgavas. The first invention of them the Greeks claim to themselves,
being not easily induced to allow the contrivance of any art to other na tions ; for it was their custom to travel into Egypt, India, and other eastern countries, to furnish themselves with sciences and inventions,
which afterwards they made public in Europe, and vented as productions of their own ; hence was derived most of the Grecian philosophy; and as
for engines used in sieges, it appears that they were invented in the east ern nations many ages before Greece had the least knowledge of, or occa sion for them . The times of Moses seem not to have been unacquainted
with them ;t several of the Jewish kings likewise appear to have known
the use of them ; whereas the Greeks, till Homer's time, are not found to have had the least hint of any such thing: Statius indeed carries them as
high as the Trojan war ; and speaking of the presents sent to Achilles by
the Greeks, in order to carry on the war, reports that Pylus and Messene furnished him with engines to batter the walls. But the poet seems to
have forgotten the rude and unskilful ages of this hero, and to have formed his description from the practices of his own times, since authors of better
credit have no mention of any such thing, Homer indeed speaks of xgóo Ful, which some ancient interpreters take for xaípecexE5, scaling ladders, 2 but it may, with no less propriety , be taken for the pinnacles of towers.3 Others again will have them to have been as ancient as the Thebanı
war, and to have been the contrivance of Capaneus, one of the seven
champions, the story of whose being knocked down with thunderbolts was grounded on no better a foundation, than that attempting to scale the walls of Thebes with ladders, he was beaten down, and slain with stones ;
and since the contrivance is so easy and obvious, it may not be wholly improbable that even those ages were acquainted with it : however, the different sorts of ladders were invented afterwards, when some of them
were aneri,4 plicatiles, folded; others dianurai, solutiles, to be taken in pieces for the convenience of carriage. The materials of which they were composed were likewise very different, being not only wood , but l'opes, leather, &c. The rest of their engines seem, however, to have been of a later date :
the ram indeed is said by Pliny to have been invented in the Trojan war , and to have given occasion to the fable of the wooden horse, built by
Epeus: but this is only conjecture, and may with the same ease be denied as asserted. Athenæus indeed speaks of this engine as very ancient, but

does not fix its invention to any determinate time, only observing that the Romans were obliged for it to the Greeks ; and since Vitruvius gives the honour of its contrivance to the Carthaginians, in their siege of Gades,
and neither Homer, nor any Greek writer for many ages after, has the least mention thereof, there seems little reason to credit Pliny's report. It is probable, however, that those ages might have some small helps in taking towns, contrived , as by several others, so particularly by Epeus,
who is famous in poetical story for being an artificer, and was very ser viceable, on that account, to the Grecian army.1
But these devices seem to have been exceedingly contemptible and unartificial; and therefore were wholly laid aside in wiser ages, and, it may be, were never practised but at their first invention . The only con
stant instruments used by the ancient Greeks in demolishing the walls,
were those they called agúrava, in Latin terebræ , which were long irons with sharp ends. Wherefore it is reasonable to conclude, that most of their famous engines were invented about the time of the Peloponnesian war, in which it is plain from Thucydides they were used . According to Diodorus 2 and Plutarch, Pericles contrived several of them with the assistance of Artemon , an artificer of Clazomenæ , as rams, tortoises, &c.;
yet Cornelius Nepos reports that some of them were used in the age be fore, by Miltiades, when he besieged Paros : Plutarch also himself, when he reports out of Ephorus that battering engines were first employed in the
Samian war by Pericles, and composed at that time by Artemon , being then a strange and surprising sight, presently after adds, that Heraclides of Pontus will have that engineer to have flourished several ages before the
Samian war ; so that nothing of certainty can be expected in this matter. The principal of the Grecian inventions were these which follow : Xsávn, testudo, a tortoise ; a defensive invention , so called from cor

ering and sheltering the soldiers, as a tortoise is covered by its shell. There were several sorts of it, as,
1. Χελώνη στρατιωτών, the military testudo, termed sometimes συνασπισ mòs, when the soldiers drawn up close to one another, and the hindermost
ranks bowing themselves, placed their targets above their head ; as if we suppose the first rank to stand erect, the rest to stoop lower and lower by degrees, till the last rank kneeled upon the ground ; the men in the front
and on the sides holding their targets before their bodies, the rest covering
the heads of those that were placed before them : so that the whole body resembled a pent-house, or roof covered with tiles, down which the enemy's missive weapons easily glided, without prejudice to the soldiers under neath . This invention was used in field -battles, but more frequently in
surprising cities before the besieged were prepared for defence, and served to protect the besiegers in their approach to the walls.
12. Xezúrn xworgis, was square ; its chief design, as the name imports, was to guard the soldiers in filling ditches, and casting up mounts. 3. Xeháin öguž, was triangular, with its front shelving downwards, for the protection of pioneers who undermined walls. 4. To these may be added testudo arietaria , with which those that bat tered the walls were protected . réppce, wicker hurdles, resembling the Roman vinea , which the soldiers held over their heads. The word came at length to signify trifles, from
the siege of Syracuse, where the Athenians calling continually for hurdles to shelter them , the besiegers in derision cried, véợgo, zépga.
Another engine, composed of boards, and like the Roman pluteus, was
used by the soldiers of Alexander. Xāpce, agger, a mount, which was raised so high as to equal , if not
exceed, the top of the besieged walls : the sides were walled in with bricks

bare. The pile itself consisted of all sorts of materials, as earth , timber, boughs, stones, &c. as Thucydides reports in the siege of Platæa: into the
middle were cast also wickers, and twigs of trees, to fasten , and, as it were, cement the other parts.)
Húgyos, turres, movable towers of wood, usually placed upon the mount: they were driven upon wheels, which were fixed within the bot
tom planks, to secure them from the enemy. Their size was not always the same, but proportioned to the towers of the besieged city . The front was usually covered with tiles, and, in later times, the sides were likewise
guarded with the same materials : their tops were covered with raw hides and other shrouds, to preserve them from fire-balls and missive weapons:
they were formed into several stories, which were able to carry , not sol diers only, but several sorts of engines.?
The invention of them is attributed to some artificers of Sicily, about the time of Dionysius the tyrant; by some to Polyidus a Thessalian , and engineer of Philip of Macedon ; by others to Diades and Chæreas, who were scholars to Polyidus, and accompanied Alexander in his eastern ex
pedition : the last of these seem rather to have been improvers of the for mer invention ; for we find mention of wooden towers in the reign of the
elder Dionysius :5 perhaps the device of making rúgyous Cogntoùs, portable turrets, to be taken in pieces and carried along with the army, may be owing to them.

There is no proper term that I know of, for that famous engine, out of which stones of a size not less than millstones were thrown, with such
violence as to dash whole houses in pieces at a blow : it was called indeed , by the Romans, balista ; but this name, though of Grecian origin , appears
lot to have been used in Greece : this engine, however, was known there, and was the same with that used by the Romans.'

They seem not to have had any constant method of defending them
selves; but this much may be observed in general, that the walls were guarded with soldiers, who, with stones , and all sorts of missile weapons,
assaulted the invaders: and the xatariatas, with other engines of that kind, were planted within the town and played spon them. Several other methods were practised against them, as when the Tyrians, heating brass
bucklers red hot, and filling them with sand and lime, poured it upon
Alexander's soldiers, which getting between their armour and flesh, burned them severely, and caused them to fling off their armour, so that the besieged , wounded them at pleasure, without receiving any hurt. Several ways they had to elude the force of their engines, and defeat their
stratagems: their mines they rendered ineffectual by counter -mines : their
mounts they let fall to the ground, by undermining the foundations: their towers, and all their engines, they burned with fire -balls: themselves they
defended with skins, wool- packs, and other things proper to ward off stones and other missile weapons: the heads of battering rams they broke off with stones of a prodigious size from the walls ; or, as we read of the Tyrians,
rendered them useless, by cutting the ropes by which they were governed with long scythes ; and if there remained no hope of defending their walls, they sometimes raised new ones with forts within . Many
vances were used , as the posture of affairs required , and as

Their manner of treating the cities they had taken was not always the same, depending upon the temper of their general, who sometimes put all, at least all that were in arms, to the sword, demolished the walls and
buildings, and made the rest slaves ; sometimes graciously received them into favour, requiring only some tributary acknowledgment. The Athe nians had a custom of sending colonies to inhabit the places they had de

populated , which they divided by lots among some of the commonalty,
when met together in a public assembly. 2 When they demolished a city, it was customary to pronounce direful curses upon those who should endeavour to rebuild it ; and this, some imagine, was the reason that Troy could never be raised ont of its ashes, though several persons attempted it, being devoted to eternal and irre
parable ruin by Agamemnon. This seems to have been a very ancient custom, and derived from the eastern nations: for, we find that Joshua,
at the destruction of Jericho, fixed an imprecation upon the person that
should rebuild it,4 which was accomplished by Hiel, the Bethelite , many ages after, in the reign of Ahab,5
CHAP. XI .
OF TIE SLAIN, AND THEIR FUNERALS.
THE ancient Greeks seem to have treated the bodies of their dead ene
mies in a very indecent and inhuman manner, basely revenging the in juries they had received from them whilst living, by disfiguring and stab
bing their carcasses , and exposing them to scorn and ignominy. This cruel and barbarous practice was not thoroughly reformed in the Trojan war, as appears from various instances in the Iliad, where dead enemies
are dismembered by insulting conquerors ; none of which is more remark able than that of Hector, who lay unburied many days, was dragged
around the walls of Troy and the sepulchre of Patroclus, and suffered every kind of indignity. This indeed might be imputed to the extravagant rage of Achilles for the loss of Patroclus, or, to a peculiar custom of Thessaly, his native country, where it was their constant practice to drag at their chariots the murderers of their near friends : did it not appear that the rest of the Greeks used him in a manner no less brutish and barbarous,
insulting over him, and stabbing his dead body .? The barbarous nations were not less guilty of this inhuman practice.

Xerxes, had his head fixed upon a pole, and his body gibbeted: but the Greeks were long before that time convinced of the villany and baseness of such actions; and therefore, when Pausanias the Spartan was urged to
retaliate Leonidas' injury upon Mardonius, Xerxes' general, overcome at Platæa, he refused to be concerned in, or to permit a revenge so barbar
ous, and unworthy of a Greek. Even in the times of the Trojan war, the
Greeks were much reformed from the inhumanity, as well of their own ancestors, as of other nations. It had formerly beer ustomary for the
conquerors to hinder their enemies from interring their dead, till they had
paid large sums for their ransom ; and some footsteps of this practice are found about that time : Hector's body was redeemed from Achilles ;2 and that of Achilles was redeemed from the Trojans for the same price he had
received for Hector's.3 And in Virgil, Nisus is introduced dissuading
his friend Euryalus from accompanying him into danger, lest, if he were slain , there should be no person that would recover by fight, or redeem .
his body. Whence it appears, that redemption of the dead was practised in those days, and that, if neglected, they were frequently suffered to lie
unburied : which misfortune happened to many of Homer's heroes, as we learn from the very entrance of the first Iliad, where he speaks of That wrath which hurlid to Pluto's gloomy reign Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore, The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain . Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore . - POPE .
But this was not so common as in more early ages ; for we find that Achilles himself celebrated the funeral of Eëtion king of Thebes in Cilicia ,
and father of Andromache . And that Agamemnon granted the Trojans free leave to perform the funeral rites of all their slain , promising upon
oath to give them no disturbance.6 Not long before, the Greeks were perfect strangers to this piece of humanity ; for we are told that Hercules
was the first that ever gave leave to his enemies to carry off their dead ;?
and others report, that the first treaty made for the recovering and bury ing the bodies of the slain , was that of Theseus with the Thebans, to inter the heroes that lost their lives in the Theban war.8 In succeeding ages
it was looked on as the greatest impiety to deny what they thought a debt to nature, and was rarely or never done to lawful enemies, except upon
extraordinary and unusual provocations; for it was thought below a gener ous temper, and unworthy of Greeks, to vent their malice, when their
enemies were deprived of all power to defend themselves.
The Athenians seem to have been careful to excess and superstition in procuring an honourable interment for the bodies of their own soldiers that
had valiantly lost their lives : insomuch that the ten admirals that gained
the famous victory over the Lacedæmonians in the sea - fight at Arginusæ, were put to death chiefly on this pretence, that they were said not to have
taken due care in gathering the bodies that floated on the waves : when yet they alleged that they were hindered by a tempest, which might have

been dangerous to the whole fleet, had they not provided for their safety by a timely retreat ;l this, no doubt, was one cause why, after a battle upon the Corinthian territory, Nicias, the Athenian general, finding that two of his men were left by an oversight, when they carried off the dead, made a halt, and sent a herald to the enemy for leave to carry them off, hereby renouncing all title to the victory, which belonged to him before, and losing the honour of erecting a trophy ; for it was presumed that he who asked leave to carry, off his dead could not be master of the field .? After that, Chabrias having put to flight the Lacedæmonians at Naxos,
father than leave any of his soldiers, or their bodies to the mercy of the
waves, chose to desist from prosecuting his victory , when he was in a fair way to have destroyed the enemy's whole fleet.3 When they carried their arms into distant countries, they reduced the bodies of the dead to ashes, that those at least might be conveyed to their relations, and deposited in the tombs of their ancestors : the first author of
which custom, they say , was Hercules, who, having sworn to Licymnius to bring back his son Argius, if he would give him leave to accompany
him in his expedition against Troy ; the young man dying, he had no other expedient to make good his oath , but by delivering his ashes to his father ;4 however, we find it practised in the Trojan war, where Nestor advised the Grecians to burn all their dead, and preserve them there till their return into Greece : 5
Αυτοί δ' αγρόμεναι κυκλήσομεν ενθάδε νεκρούς Then we will haste with oxen , mules, and wains, Βουσι και ημιόνοισιν" ατάρ κατακρομεν αυτούς To wheel these bodies down toward the fleet, Τυθον αποπρό νεών , ώς κ' εστία παισιν έκαστος Where we will burn them , that the bones of each οϊκαδ' άγη, όταν αύτε νεώμεθα πατρίδα γαίαν . May be delivered safe at our return, To his own children.
The Lacedæmonians thought this an unprofitable labour, and therefore
buried their dead in the country where they died ; only their kings they em balmed with honey, and conveyed them home, as we learn from Plutarch , who reports that when Agesilaus resigned his life at the haven of Mene laus, a desert shore in Africa, the Spartans having no honey to embalm his body, wrapped it in wax , and so carried it to Lacedæmon . The soldiers all attended at the funeral solemnities, with their arms
turned upside down, it being customary for mourners, in most of their actions, to behave themselves in a manner contrary to what was usual at other times : in those places where it was the fashion to wear long hair , mourners were shaved ; and where others shaved , mourners wore long hair. Their conjecture , therefore, is frivolous, who imagine the soldiers turned the heads of their shields downwards, lest the gods, whose images
were engraven upon them , should be polluted with the sight of a corpse ;" since not the gods only, but any other figures, were frequently represented
there ; not some few only, but the whole company held them in the same posture : besides, not the shields alone, but their other arms were pointed

sometimes their parentage and exploits; which honour the Spartan law giver granted to none besides women who died in childbed , and soldiers 3 that lost their lives in battle : these were buried with green boughs, and
honoured with an oration in their praise. Such of them as had excelled
the rest, and were judged complete and perfect warriors, had a farther honour of being interred in their red coats, which were the soldiers' habit at Sparta. Their arms were likewise fixed upon their tombs ; whence Leonidas, the Spartan king, is introduced in the epigram refusing the
ple robe of Xerxes, and desiring no other ornament to beautify his tomb than his buckler :

This custom was not peculiar to Sparta, but practised all over Greece ; where, besides their arms, it was usual to add the badge of whatever other
profession they had borne. Thus Elpenor, appearing in the shades below
to Ulysses, entreats him to fix the oar with which he used to row upon his tomb, and to cast his arms into the funeral pile ;) and Misenus, the trum peter of Æneas, has his arms, oar , and trumpet fixed upon his grave.. It was customary for the Spartan matrons, when a battle had been
fought near home, to examine the lifeless bodies of their sons; and such as had received more wounds behind than before, they conveyed away
privately, or left in the common heap ; but those who had a greater num ber of wounds in their breasts, they carried away with joy and triumph , to be reposited amongst their ancestors.? They were carried home upon their bucklers ; and hence that famous command of the mother to her son ,8

their own relations; after which went a covered hearse, in memory of those whose bodies could not be found : all these, accompanied with the
whole body of the people, were carried to the public burying -place, called Ceramicus, and there interred : one oration was spoken in commendation
of them all, and their monuments were adorned with pillars, inscriptions,
and all other ornaments usual about the tombs of the most honourable per The oration was pronounced by the fathers of those of the deceased, who had behaved themselves most valiantly. Thus, after the famous battle
of Marathon, the fathers of Callimachus and Cynægirus were appointed to make the funeral oration . And upon the return of the day on which the solemnity was first held, the same oration was constantly repeated every year. This was their ordinary practice at Athens; } but those valiant men who were slain in the battle of Marathon had their bodies interred in the
place where they fell, to perpetuate the memory of that wonderful vic tory.4
It may be observed farther, that in their lists the names of the soldiers deceased were marked with the letter e, being the initial of Ouróvēki, dead;
those of the living with T, the first in Tnpoúpievos, preserved : this custom was afterwards adopted by the Romans.”

Their booty consisted of prisoners and spoils. The prisoners that could
not ransom themselves were made slaves, and employed in the service of their conquerors, or sold .
The spoils were distinguished by two names, being either taken from the dead, and termed oxūza, or from the living, which they called acquga :
they consisted of whatever movables belonged to the conquered , whose whole right and title, by the law of arms, passed to the conquerors.6 Homer's heroes no sooner gain a victory over any of their rivals, than , without farther delay, they seize their armour. Instances of this are as
numerous as their combats. But, however this practice might be usual learned dissertation respecting where it is said, that the Pytha 1 Polemo in Argumento tà

among the great commanders who rode in chariots to the battle, fought by themselves, and encountered men of their own quality in single combat ; yet inferior soldiers were not ordinarily permitted such liberty, but gathered the spoils of the dead after the fight was ended ; if they attempted
it before, they were even then looked upon as deficient in discipline. Nes
tor gives the Greeks a particular caution in this matter : 1 " Ο φίλοι, ήρωες Δαναοί , θεράποντίς'Αρηος ,

This

was

in

;

no

,
than
they
fell
to
stripping

the

of
their

;
only
the
Lacedæmonians
were
forbidden
to

the

that

,
and

a
Lacedæmonian
to
be
enriched
by

;
3
but
this
seems
only
a
pretence
,
since
there
are
several
instances
of
their
dedicating
part
of
their
booty
to
the
gods
:
the

,
perhaps
,
may
be

from
the
constitution
of
their
state
,
whereby
an
equality
was
maintained
amongst
them
,
and
nothing
more
severely
prohibited
,
or
more
repugnant
to
the
very
foundation
of
their
government
,
than
to
acquire
or
possess
large
estates
:
wherefore
,
to
prevent
their
sol
diers
from
seizing
upon
the
spoils
,
they
had
always
three
hundred
men
appointed
to
observe
their
actions
,
and
to
put
the
law
in
execution
against
delinquents
.
The whole booty was brought to the general, who had the first choice, divided part amongst such as had signalized themselves, according to
their quality and merits, and allotted the remainder in equal portions to the rest ; thus in the Trojan war, when the captive ladies were to be
chosen, Agamemnon , in the first place, took Astynome, Chryses' daugh ter ; next, Achilles had Hippodamia, daughter to Brises ; then Ajax chose
Tecmessa, and so on :5 whence Achilles complains of Agamemnon, that he had always the best part of the booty ; himself, who sustained the bur
den of the war, being content with a small pittance . And whenever any
booty of extraordinary value was taken, we find the soldiers reserving it for a present to their general, or the commander of their party. Instances
of this kind are frequent, as in other writers, so especially in Homer : Ulysses' company always honoured him with the best and choicest part of
what they took . Herodotus reports,” that after the victory over Mardo nius, Xerxes' lieutenant, Pausanias the Spartan, being at that time general of all the Grecian forces, was presented with a great booty of women , money , horses, camels, &c., over and above what was give to any other.

This practice indeed was so universal, that to be a commander , and to
have the first share of the booty, are used by the poets as equivalent ex
pressions. But before the spoils were distributed, they looked on themselves as bound to make an offering out of them to the gods, to whose assistance
they were indebted for them all; those separated to this use were termed ακροθίνια , either g. άκροσίνια , παρά το σίνεσθαι εν μάχη πολλούς, because the war , in which they were collected , had destroyed many ; or årò TO Iords,
because after sea - engagements they were exposed upon the shore ;3 or
rather from their being taken år ' cxcou To Jovès, from the top of the heap ; because all the spoils being collected into one heap, the first fruits were offered to the gods:4 in allusion to which custom , Megara in Euripides, telling what choice of wives she had made for her sons out of Athens, Sparta , and Thebes, thus expresses it : 1 γώ δε νύμφας ηκροθιγιαζόμην.
The gods to whom this honour was paid were not only those whom they
looked on as having a peculiar concern in all affairs of war , as Mars, Minerva, &c. but several others, as Jupiter, Juno, and any to whom they
thought themselves obliged for success ; especially those that were pro tectors of their city, or country.
They had several methods of consecrating spoils ; sometimes they col lected them into a heap, and consumed them with fire ; sometimes they made presents, which were dedicated and hung up in temples, So Pau sanias, the Spartan, is reported to have consecrated out of the Persian
spoils a tripod to Delphian Apollo, and a statue of brass, seven cubits long, to Olympian Jupiter.”
It was very customary to dedicate their enemies' armour, and to hang it up in temples ; but the Lacedæmonians were forbidden this custom ;
which perhaps may be the meaning of Cleomenes' forementioned replys for that they were allowed to offer their other spoils, appears as well from that of Pausanias, as from several other instances. This custom was very
ancient, and universally received ; not in Greece alone, but most other countries: hence Hector promises to dedicate his enemies? armour in Apollo's temple, if he would vouchsafe him victory :7
Ει δε κ' εγώ τον έλω, οφη δέ μοι εύχος Απόλλων, Shall stretch your daring champion jp the dust, Τεύχεα συλήσας , οίσω ποτί "Ιλιον ιρήν, If mine the glory to despoil the foe,
Καικρεμόω ποτί νηον Απόλλωνος εκάτοιο. On Phæbus' temple I'll his arms bestow . And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust, Virgil alludes to this custom in his description of the temple where La tinus gave audience to the ambassadors of Æneas.8
Many other instances to the same purpose occur in authors. This cus
tom seems to have been derived by Greece from the eastern nations , where no doubt it was practised : what else can be the meaning of Goliath's sword being reposited in the Jewish place of worship ? 9

Nor was it customary only to dedicate to the gods weapons taken from enemies, but their own likewise, when retired from the noise of war to a
private life ; which seems to have been done as a grateful acknowledgment to the gods, by whose protection they had been delivered from dangers. 1 But lest these arms should furnish malcontents, in sudden tumults and insurrections, they seem to have been usually some way or other rendered
unfit for present service : the bucklers, for instance, were hung up without handles ; whence a person, in one of the poets, seeing them otherwise, cries out in a fright, Ο μου τάλας, έχουσι γάρ πόρπακες . Unhappy wretch ! the bucklers handles have.
The reason may be collected from the foregoing verses, where another
says , Ου γαρ ειρήν, είπερ φιλείς των δημoν, εκ προνοίας If you sincerely wish the public gond, Ταύτας εαν αυτούς τους πόρπαξιν ανατεθήναι.. You should not suffer any to devote Bucklers with handles.
As a farther expression of their gratitude to the gods, it was customary to offer solemn sacrifices, and return public thanks to them. Here it may be observed, that the Lacedæmonians, for their greatest successes by force
of arms, offered no more than a cock to the god of war ; but when they obtained a victory by stratagem , and without blood , they sacrificed an ox ;?
by this they gave their generals to understand, that policy as well as valour was required in a complete warrior, and that those victories were to
be preferred whereby they suffered the least damage ; excelling herein the Roman constitution, which rewarded with greater honours the vietors in open field, than those who gained a conquest by policy, which was esteemed less noble and becoming Romans : wherefore those were permitted to enter the city in triumph, but the latter were only honoured with an ova tion . It may not be improper in this place to add, that the Greeks had
a custom which resembled the Roman triumph ; for the conquerors used
to make a procession through the middle of their city, crowied with gar lands, repeating hymns and songs, and brandishing their spears : the cap
tives were also led by them , and all their spoils exposed to public view ; to do which they called Isareils.v.4
Trophies were called by the ancient Athenians tporaia, by succeeding ages toőruia :5 they were dedicated to some of the gods, especially Jupiter, surnamed Tpórusos, and Tportaloûxo5,6 and Juno, who shared in her hus
band's title , being called Tgonaice;? whence Lycophron :8 Τροπαίας μαστόν ούθηλον θεάς. The manner of adorning trophies was hanging up all sorts of arms taken
from the enemy. To these they usually added the names of the god to whom they were dedicated, of the conquerors, and of those overcome by them , with an account of all the spoils, and other remarkable occurrences in the war : this inscription was called iniygaon, or irigeapped, and

to the fact in several places, and adds farther, that the trophy erected by
Æneas was upon a hill; whence it may seem probable that it was custom ary to set them upon eminent places, to render them more conspicuous.3 In the same manner, Pompey having subdued the Spaniards, erected a trophy upon the top of the Pyrenean mountains.
Instead of trees, succeeding ages erected pillars of stone, or brass, to perpetuate the memory of their victories : to raise these, they termed
ιστάναι τρόπαιον, which expression was likewise applied to the erection of
trees ; for if the place they pitched upon was void of trees fit for their pur pose, it was usual to supply that defect by fixing one there.
To demolish a trophy was looked on as unlawful, and a kind of sacri lege, because they were all consecrated to some deity ; nor was it less a
crime to pay divine adoration before them, or to repair them when de cayed , as may likewise be observed of the Roman triumphal arches ; this being a means to revive the memory of forgotten quarrels, and engage
posterity to revenge the disgrace of their ancestors : for the same reason

Sometimes they erected towers, which they adorned with the spoils of their enemies ; which was likewise a Roman custom , and practised by
Fabius Maximus, and Domitius Ænobarbus, after the victory over the Allobroges.6 It was also customary to raise altars to the gods; an instance of which
we have in Alexander, who, returning from his Indian expedition, erected altars in height scarcely inferior to the most lofty towers, and in breadth exceeding them .?

their ranks, by a law of Charondas, were obliged to sit three days in the
public forum in women's apparel. At Athens, horgáTito , such as re fused to serve in the wars ; asmotántai, they who deserted their ranks; and ds.doi, cowards, were neither permitted to wear garlands, nor to enter the ispès onpentsañ, public temples: and were farther obliged by the unde cimviri to appear in the court called Heliæa, where a fine or other pan ishment was inflicted according to their demerit. If a fine was inflicted , the criminal was kept in bonds till he made payment. Among these are to be reckoned poocorides, they who lost their bucklers, which was ac counted a token of extreme cowardice. Hence a law came to be enacted,
that whoever should impute this crime to any person undeservedly, should be fined. But, of all others, the Lacedæmonians inflicted the heaviest punishments on all such offenders ; for their laws obliged them either to conquer, or to die upon the place ; and such as quitted their bucklers lay under as great disgrace as they had forsaken their ranks. Those who
fled from the field of battle were not only deprived of all honours, but it
was likewise a disgrace to intermarry with them ; whoever met them in the streets had liberty to beat them, nor was it permitted them to resist in their own defence; and to make them more remarkable , whenever they went abroad, they were obliged to wear a nasty habit, their gowns were

Their scandal was likewise extended to their whole family, and therefore their mothers frequently atoned for their crime, by stabbing them at their first meeting ; which was a common practice, and frequently alluded to in
the Greek epigrams, in one of which, a Spartan matron, having run her son through, thus insults over him : "Εβρε , κακόν φύτευμα , διά σκότος , ού διά μίσος By that polluted coast where you abide: Ευρώτας δεολαίς μηδ' ελάφοισι ρέος

as

,
were

?
Besides
the
rewards
of
valour
already
meñtioned
,
there
were
several
others
:
the
private
soldiers
were
put
into
office
,
and
the
subordinate
off
cers
were
honoured
with
greater
commands
.
It
was
likewise
customary
for
the
general
to
reward
those
that
signalized
themselves
with
large
pre
sents
:
whence
Telamon
,
being
the
first
that
gained
the
top
of
Troy’s
walls
,
when
it
was
besieged
by
Hercules
,
had
the
honour
to
have
Hesione
,
the
king's
daughter
,
for
his
captive
;
Theseus
was
presented
by
the
same
hero
with
Antiope
,
the
Amazonian
queen
,
for
his
service
in
the
expedition
against
the
Amazons
.
The
poets
frequently
introduce
commanders
en
couraging
their
soldiers
with
promises
of
this
nature
.
Thus
Agamemnon
,
in
Homer,
animates
Teucer
to
conduct
himself
courageously
,
by
assuring
him
of
a
considerable
reward
,
when
the
city
should
be
taken
;
and
Asca
nius
,
in
Virgil
,
makes
no
less
promises
to
Nisus
,
and
to
Euryalus,
his
companion
in
danger.3
Sometimes crowns were presented, on which were inscribed the person's name and actions that had merited them , as appears from the inscription
upon the crown, presented by the Athenians to Conon , Κονων από της ναυ μαχίας της προς Λακεδαιμονίους..
Others
were
honoured
with
permission
to
raise
pillars
,
or
erect
statues
to
the
gods
,
with
inscriptions
declaring
their
victories
;
this
Plutarch
supposes
to
have
been
an
honour
rarely
conferred
even
on
the
greatest
commanders
:
Cimon
indeed
was
favoured
therewith
,
but
Miltiades
and
Themistocles
never
could
obtain
it
;
nay
,
when
Miltiades
only
desired
a
crown
of
olive
,
one
Sochares
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
,
and
replied
,
When
thou
shalt
conquer
alone
,
Miltiades
,
thou
shalt
triumph
so
too
;
which
words
were
so
agreeable
to
the
populace
,
that
his
suit
was
rejected
.
The
reason
why
Cimon
was
more
respected
than
the
rest
,
our
author
thinks
,
"
was
,
that
under
other
commanders
they
stood
upon
the
defensive
;
but
by
his
conduct
they
not
only
repulsed
their
enemies
,
but
invaded
them
in
their
own
country
.
But
perhaps
a
more
true
and
real
account
may
be
taken
from
the
change
of
times
;
for
the
primitive
ages
seem
not
to
have
been
so
liberal
in
the
distribution
of
rewards
as
those
that
succeeded
;
for
later
generations
degenerating
from
their
ancestors
,
and
producing
fewer
instances
of
magnanimity
and

valour
,

way
to
honour
became
easier
,
and

common
performances

wards, which before were only paid to persons of the first rank for virtue and courage.?
Another honour conferred at Athens upon the valiant, was to have their arms placed in the citadel, and to be called Cecropide, ' citizens of the true old blood ;' to which custom the poet alludes : Ου καλλινίκους Κεκροπίδας έθηκ ' εγώ.
Some were presented with a zavornía , or, complete suit of armour : as
we find of Alcibiades, when he was very young, and returned from the expedition against Potidæa.?
Others were complimented with songs of triumph , the first of which were composed in honour of Lysander, the Spartan general.3 They who lost any of their limbs in the war , were called údúværs , and
were maintained at the public expense, provided they had not an estate of three Attic pounds yearly : on which account they were examined by the senate of five hundred . Their allowance was an obolus a day. Some affirm they had two oboli every day ; others, that they received nine drachmæ , that is, fifty -four oboli, every month . And it is probable that
their maintenance was increased or diminished according to the exigency
of affairs. The custom of maintaining disabled soldiers was introduced by Solon , who is said to have given an allowance to one Thersippus: after wards it was established by a law during the tyranny of Pisistratus . Many other honours were paid to such as deserved well of their coun try ; but I shall mention only one more, which consisted in the care of
the children of such as valiantly sacrificed their lives for the glory and pre servation of the Athenian commonwealth :5 they were carefully educated at the public charge, till they came to maturity, and were then presented with a complete suit of armour, and brought forth before the people, one of the public ministers proclaiming before them , “ that hitherto, in remem brance of their fathers' merits, the commonwealth had educated these young men, but now dismissed them so armed, to go forth, and thank their country by imitatiog their fathers' examples . For their farther encour
agement, they had the honour of a goodgia , or having the first seats at shows, and all public meetings.
The laws of Solon made provision also for the parents of those that died in the wars, it being extremely reasonable that they should be maintained
at the public expense who had lost their children , the comfort and support of their declining age, in the service of the public.6.
It may not be improper to add something concerning their way of send ing intelligence ; this was done several ways, and by several sorts of mes sengers ; such were their ' Hvepodgógos, who were lightly armed with darts and hand - grenadoes ; or with bows and arrows :? Phidippides, famous in the story of Miltiades, for his vision of Pan , was one of these .S

But the contrivance , of all others the most celebrated for close convey
ance of intelligence, was the Lacedæmonian oxutúan, which was a white roll of parchment wrapped about a black stick ; it was about four cubits in length, and was so called from orútos, a skin . The manner and use of it was this : when the magistrates gave commission to any general or
admiral, they took two round pieces of wood , exactly equal to one another ; one of these they kept, the other was delivered to the commander, to whom when they had any thing of moment to communicate , they cut a long narrow scroll of parchmen and rolling it about their own staff, one
fold close upon another, they wrote their business upon it ; then taking it off, they despatched it to the commander, who, applying it to his own staff, the folds exactly fell in one with another, as at the writing, and the characters which , before it was wrapped up, were confusedly disjoined and
unintelligible, appeared very plain .”

or from slight and contemptible beginnings, have been, by long experi ence, curious observations, and various improvements, matured and
brought to perfection. Instances of this kind are everywhere frequent and obvious, but none can be produced more remarkable than in the art of
navigation : which, though now arrived to a pitch of perfection beyond most other arts, by those successful additions it has received from almost every age of the world , was in the beginning so mean and imperfect, that

to
the
whole
invention
.
The first ships were built without art or contrivance, and had neither
strength nor durableness, beauty nor ornament ; but consisted only of planks laid together, and just so compacted as to keep out the water . In some places they were nothing else but trunks of trees made hollow , which
were called thoia plovóžuña , as consisting only of one piece of timber .
In later ages, also, they were made use of at some places, being the same with those called ordon, in the strict and most proper acceptation
of that word ,” from orárted@mi, as made by hollowing, and, as it were ,
digging in a tree. Nor was wood alone applied to this use, but materials that float upon the water without sinking, such as the Egyptian
reed papyrus, or , to mention no more, leather, of which the primitive ships were frequently composed, and called πλοία διφθερινά, or δερμάτινα, These were sometimes begirt with wickers, and frequently used in that mander upon the rivers of Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sabæan Arabia, even in later times ; but in the first of them , we find no mention of any thing but
leather, or hides sewed together. In a ship of this sort, Dardanus secured his flight to the country afterwards called Troas, when by a terrible deluge he was forced to leave Samothrace, his former place of residence . Cha
ron's infernal boat was of the same composition .?
When ships were brought to a little more perfection , and increased in size, the sight of them struck the ignorant people with terror and amaze ment ; for it was no small surprise to behold great floating castles of un

usual forms, full of living men, and with wings, as it were, expanded , flying upon the sea :1 what else could have given occasion to the fiction of
Perseus' fight to the Gorgons, who, as Aristophanes expressly tells us, was carried in a ship ??
Περσεύς προς "Αργος ναυστολών το Γοργόνος παρακομίζων. What other origin could there be for the famous story of Triptolemus,
who was famed to ride upon a winged dragon, only because in a time of
dearth at Athens he sailed to more fruitful countries to supply the neces sities of his people ? or to the fable of the winged horse Pegasus, who ?
was nothing but a ship of that name with sails, and for that reason was feigned to be the offspring of Neptune the emperor of the sea ?' Nor was there any other ground for the stories of griffins, or of ships transformed into birds and fishes, which we frequently meet with in the ancient poets .
So acceptable to the first ages of the world were inventions of this nature,
that whoever made any improvements in the art of navigation , built new ships, of forms better fitted for strength or swiftness than those before
used , rendered the old more commodious by any additional contrivance, or discovered countries untraced by former travellers, were thought worthy
of the greatest honours, and, like other common benefactors to mankind, admitted into the number of the deified heroes ; they had their inventions also consecrated and fixed in the heavens : hence we have the signs of Aries and Taurus, which were nothing but two ships ; the former trans
ported Phryxus from Greece to Colchos, the latter Europa out of Phoeni cia into Crete : Argo likewise, Pegasus, and Perseus' whale, were new sorts of ships, which being held in great admiration by the rude and ig porant mortals of those times, were, in memory of their inventors, trans
lated amongst the stars, and metamorphosed into constellations by the poets of those or the succeeding ages.
At their first appearance in the world, all ships, for whatever use de signed, were of the same form ; but the various ends of navigation , some of which were better answered by one form , some by another, soon gave
occasion to fit out ships, not in bigness only, but in the manner of their
construction and equipment, differing from one another . They were chiefly of three sorts, ships of burden , of war , and of passage. Ships of
passage were distinguished by several names, taken usually from their
cargoes ; those that served for the transportation of men being called by the general names of rógice and iribáds, or, when filled with armed men,
by the particular titles of οπλιταγωγοί, and στρατιωτιδες, these in which horses were transported were named irinyo, in raywyol, and hippagines.

Ships of war are said to have been first rigged out by Parhalus, or Samyres; or, as others say, by Semiramis; but according to some, by Ægæon . They were farther distinguished from other sorts of ships by various engines , and accessions of building, some to defend their own sol diers, others to annoy enemies ; and from one another, in later ages, by several orders, or banks of oars, which were not, as some vainly imagine, placed upon the same level in different parts of the ships; nor yet, accord ing to others, directly and perpendicularly above one another's heads; but
their seats , being fixed one at the back of another, ascended gradually in the manner of stairs. The most usual number of these banks was three,

ber to ten ; Alexander the Great, to twelve ; Ptolemy Soter, to fifteen : Philip, the father of Perseus, had a ship of sixteen banks ; then, for it was easy to make additions, when the method of erecting one bank above another had been found out ; Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, built a
ship of thirty banks ; and Ptolemy Philopater, from a vain - glorious desire
to outdo all the world besides, farther enlarged the number to forty,8 which, all other things bearing a just proportion , raised the ship to such a
prodigious size, that it appeared at a distance like a floating mountain , or island , and, upon a nearer view , seemed like a huge castle upon the floods.
It contained four thousand rowers, four hundred mariners employed in other services, and nearly three thousand soldiers. But this, and such
like fabrics, served only for show and ostentation , being by their great bulk rendered unwieldy and unfit for use, The common names by which
they were known, were Cyclades, or Ætnæ , islands or mountains, to
which they seemed almost equal in size, consisting, as some report, of as many materials as would have been sufficient for the construction of at
least fifty triremes. Besides those already mentioned, there were other ships, with half banks of oars ; such as smoaia , or épíodos, which seems to have been be twixt an unireme and bireme, and consisted of a bank and a half; and
Toinenjesoría , betwixt a bireme and trireme, having two banks and a half:
these, though perhaps built in other respects after the model of the long ships, or men of war, are seldom comprehended under name, and are

sometimes mentioned in opposition to them . Several other ships are mentioned, which differed from those already enumerated ; being fitted for particular uses, or certain seas ; employed upon urgent necessities in naval fights, but more commonly as úningstizai, tenders, and victualling ships, to supply the main fleet with provisions ; and sometimes built for expedition to carry expresses, and observe the enemy's motions, without danger of being seized by the heavier and armed vessels . These were
distinguished from the former by the manner of their construction and equipment, being in part like men of war, partly like ships of burden , and in some things differing from both, as the various exigencies they served
in seemed to require.
CHAP. XV.
OF THE PARTS, ORNAMENTS , &c. OF SHIPPING .
HAVING treated of the different sorts of ships used amongst the ancient Greeks, I shall next endeavour to describe the principal parts of which they consisted ; and in doing so, shall chiefly follow the account of Schef
fer, who has discussed this subject so copiously, and with such industry
and learning, that very little room is left for farther enlargement. The principal parts of which ships consisted were three, viz. the body , the prow, and the stern : these were again composed of other smaller parts , which shall briefly be described in their order.
1. In the body, or middle part of the ship, was ogów , the keel, which was composed of wood, and therefore, from its strength and firmness,
called otsign: it was placed at the bottom of the ship, being designed to cut and glide through the waves, and therefore was not broad, but narrow
and sharp ; whence it may be perceived that not all ships, but only the
jeangai, whose bodies were strait, and of a small circumference, were pro vided with keels, the rest having usually flat bottoms. ? Round the
keel were placed pieces of wood , to save it from damage when the ship was first launched into the water, or when it bulged against rocks ; these were called to stopera, in Latin cunei.3
Next to the keel was φάλκις; within which was contained the άντλία , or pump, through which water was conveyed out of the ship.5
After
this
was

the

placed

Above the pump was a hollow place, called by Herodotus roían rñs onòs ; by Pollux xúros and yéotpo, because large and capacious, after the

with ribs, which were pieces of wood rising from the keel upwards, and
called by Hesychius vocesis; hy others éprvírove, the belly of the ship being contained within them ; in Latin costæ : upon these were placed certain planks, which Aristophanes calls έντερονείας, or έντερωνίδα.
The Fasupai, or sides of the ship, which encompassed all the former
parts on both hands, were composed of large rafters, extended from prow to stern , and called υποζώματα, ζωστήρες , ” and ζωμιάματα,3 because by them the whole fabric was begirt or surrounded .
In both these sides, the rowers had their places, cailed toixos, and
idároc , in Latin fori and transtra , placed above one another ; the lowest
was called Já napos, and those that laboured in it Jandusos : the middle Cuyà , and the men fúzios: the uppermost Igúvol, whence the rowers were
termed Igavítas. In these were spaces through which the rowers put their oars ; these were sometimes one continued vacuity from one end to
the other, called spréons, but more usually distinct holes, each of which was designed for a single oar ; these were styled repeta, tguthata , as
also opladjol, because not unlike the eyes of living creatures : all of them
were, by a more general name, termed ' yxuta, from containing the oars :5 but synwr y seems to have been another thing, signifying the spaces be tween the banks of oars on each side, where the passengers were placed :
on the top of all these, was a passage, or place to walk in, called rúgodos and ragábgavos, as joining to the Spévou, or uppermost bank of oars.

was customary to beautify the
prow with gold, and various sorts of paint and colours. In the primitive times, red was most in use ; whence Homer's ships were commonly digni
fied with the titles of pia Tomágnes, and Ponirotégnos, or red -faced. The
blue, likewise, or sky-colour, was frequently made use of, as bearing a near resemblance to the colour of the sea, whence we find ships called by Ilomer nvaróxewqov, by Aristophanes zvavipßodo. Several other colours
were also made use of, nor were they barely varnished over with them,

but very often annealed by wax melted in the fire, so that neither the sun ,
winds, or water, were able to deface them . The art of doing this was
called , from the wax , xngoycæpice; from the fire, šyxavotinha! In these colours, the various forms of gods, animals, plants, & c. were usually de
scribed, which were often added as ornaments to other parts also of the ships, as plainly appears from the ancient monuments presented to the world by Bayfius.
The sides of the prow were termed # tagà , or wings ; and ragice, ac cording to Scheffer, or rather ragsscà, for since the prow is commonly compared to a human face, it will naturally follow that its sides should be called cheeks. The top of these , as likewise of the stern , was called rage

Tæpéenjoy was the flag by which ships were distinguished from one
another : it was placed in the prow , just below the oróros, being some times carved, and frequently painted (whence it is in Latin termed pic
turu ), representing the form of a mountain , a tree, a flower, or any other thing : in this it was distinguished from what is called tutela, or the safe guard of the ship, which always represented some of the gods, to whose
care and protection the ship was recommended ; for which reason it was
held sacred, and had the privilege of being a refuge and sanctuary to such as fled to it ; prayers also and sacrifices were offered , and oaths confirmed before it, as the mansion of the tutelary and presiding deity of the ship :
now and then we find it taken for the papáonjov ,, and perhaps, in some few instances, the images of gods might be represented upon the flags: by some it is placed also in the prow , but by most authors of credit it is as
signed to the stern . Farther, the tutela and rackonov are frequently distinguished in express words, that being always signified by the image
of a god ; this usually of some creature , or feigned representation. The ship in which Europa was conveyed from Phoenicia into Crete, had a bull
for its flag, and Jupiter for its tutelary deity ; which gave occasion to the fable of her being ravished by that god in the shape of a bull. It was cus tomary for the ancients to commit their ships to the protection of those deities whom they thought most concerned for their safety, or to whom they bore any sort of relation or affection. Thus we learn ,? that the whole
fleet of Theseus, consisting of sixty sail, was under the care of Minerva, the protectress of Athens; the navy of Achilles was committed to the Nereids, or sea -nymphs, because of the relation he had to them on account
of his mother Thetis, who was one of their number ; and, to mention no
more, the Boeotian ships had for their tutelary god Cadmus, represented with a dragon in his hand, because he was the founder of Thebes, the
principal city in Boeotia. Nor were whole fleets only , but single ships
recommended to certain deities, whom the ancients usually chose out of
the number of those who were reputed the protectors of their country or

family, or who presided over the business they were going about ; thus merchants committed themselves and their ships to the care of Mercury , soldiers to Mars, and lovers to Venus and Cupid .' On the prow of the ship , about the arómos, was placed a round piece of
wood called Truxis, and sometimes oplaagòs, the eye of the ship, because fixed in its fore -deck ; on this was inscribed the name of the ship , which was usually taken from the flag ; thus Ovid tells us his ship received its
name from the helmet painted upon it : hence comes the frequent mention of ships called Pegasi, Scyllæ , Bulls, Rams, ers, &c. which the poets took the liberty of representing as living creatures that transported their
riders from one country to another; nor was there, according to some, any other ground for the well known fictions of Pegasus,3 the winged horse of Bellerophon, and of the Ram that is reported to have carried Phryxus to Colchos.
The whole fabric being completed, it was fortified with pitch to secure the wood from the waters; hence it is that Homer's ships are everywhere
mentioned with the epithet of jénaires, black . The first that made use of pitch were the inhabitants of Phæacia, called afterwards Corsica . Wax
was sometimes employed for the same purpose . Now and then it was applied with a mixture of rosin , or other suitable materials ; whence the colour of ships was not always the same, and the epithets ascribed to them in the poets are various.
After all, the ship being bedecked with garlands and flowers, the ma riners also adorned with crowns, she was launched into the sea, with loud
acclamations, and other expressions of mirth and joy ;6 and being purified by a priest with a lighted torch, an egg, and brimstone,' or after some other manner, was consecrated to the god whose image she bore .

OF THE TACKLING AND INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED IN NAVIGATION.
'Tue instruments used in navigation were of various kinds, being either necessary to all sorts of navigation , or only to some form of it, as that by sạils, by oars, &c. The chief of the former sort were as follow :

that

ancient

to

these
were
let
down
by
cords

their
weight

covered whether the bottom was firm and commodious for anchoring, or dangerous by reason of quicksands or other obstructions. It was com monly of lead or brass, or other ponderous metal, and was let down by a chain into the deep .?
Kovtoi, called by Sophocles añxtpoz,2 in Latin conti, long poles, used to sound the depth of shallower waters, to thrust the ship from rocks and shelves, and to force her forwards in fords and shallows, where the waters
had not strength enough to carry her. 'Αποβάθραι, επιβάθραι, or κλίμακες , were little bridges or stairs joining the land to ships, or one ship to another .
' Avrdíov, čvrhov, in Latin haustrum , tolleno, or tollena, &c., a swipe, or engine to draw up water . To some of the above-mentioned instruments certain ropes were re
quired, and distinguished according to their several uses ; as,
Islopata , the cables with which anchors were cast into the sea, called
sometimes ráépesh.01,3 or ráunhos :* hence, when Christ, speaking of the difficulty of a rich man's entering into heaven, tells his disciples, it is harder than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle ; Theophylact
and some others interpret the word ráundes, not of the animal called a camel, but a cable,
' Púucte, óaxoi, or otsipus, parolcones, remulci, ropes by which ships were towed .
'Arbyese, iriysia , niiomata , agupernova, retinacula , cords wherewith ships were tied to the shore. In most harbours stones were erected for
this purpose, being bored through like rings, and thence called dantúa.cos to these the cords cast out of the stern were bound : this custom was
always observed when ships came into port ; and therefore, when they put to sea, it is usually said they did solverefunes, loose their cords.*6 This was done, that the ships might be secured from the violence of the winds
and waves ; for which reason , in those commodious harbours that lay not exposed to them , ships remained loose and untied ; whence Homer :7 'Εν δε λιμήν εξορμος, ίν' ου χρεώ πείσματός εστιν. So still the port, there was no need of ropes .

Exahmoi vere round pieces of wood, on which the rowers hung their oars when they rested from their labours: hence, vacūs rgíoxanpos, a ship
with three rows of scalmi, or a trireme.,
Tgóros, Flow Wrñges , were leathern thongs, with which the oars were hung upon the scalmi; and with which the rudder was bound . Leather, and skins of beasts, were applied also to several other uses, as to cover the
scalmi, and the holes through which the cars were put forth, to preserve them from being worn . There were skins under the rowers called inn
ρέσια , and sometimes υπαγκώνια, οι υποπύγια των ερετών, from Saving the elbows or breeches of the rowers,
' Edúasa obajaru , Sugà, in Latin , transtra and juga, were the seats of the rowers.
The instruments used in sailing were as follow :
' Istia , pórowves, águiro , sails, which are by some thought to have been first invented by Dædalus, and to have given origin to the fable of his
using wings: others refer this invention to Icarus, making Dædalus the contriver of masts and sail -yards. At first there was only one sail in a ship, but afterwards a greater number was found convenient, the names of which were these :
' Agriuav, by sometaken for supparum , or the top -sail, which hung on the top of the mast. ' Arátic , the great sails . Aórwy, the trinket, or small sail in the fore -deck : 6 others make exterior nd down the same.
' Eridgguos, the mizzen -sail, which was larger than the former, and hung in the hind -deck .?
Sails were commonly made of linen , sometimes of any other materials fit for receiving and repelling the winds. In Dio ,8 we have mention of
leathern sails ; it was likewise usual, for want of other sails, to hang up their garments ; whence came the fable of Hercules, who is feigned to have sailed with the back of a lion, because he used no other sail but his garment, which was a lion's skin.9

CHAP. XVII .
OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF WAR IN SHIPS.
What I have hitherto delivered concerning the parts and construction of
ships has been spoken in general, without respect to any particular sort of
them ; it remains, therefore, that, in the next place, I give you a brief account of what was farther necessary to equip a man of war.
" Eußodos, was a beak of wood, fortified with brass, whence it is called
χάλκωμα νεών,3 and ships have sometimes the epithet of χαλκέμβολοι: one or more of these was always fastened to the prow , to annoy the ene
my's ships, and the whole prow was sometimes covered with brass, to guard it from rocks and assaults. The person that first used these beaks
is said to have been one Pisæus, an Italian ;! for it will not be allowed that
the primitive Greeks had any knowledge of them , since no such thing is mentioned in Homer, which could scarcely have happened had they been invented at the time of the Trojan war : yet Æschylus * gives Nestor's ship the epithet of dexíjeßodos, or armed with ten beaks ; and Iphigenia , in Euripides, speaks of brazen beaks. But it may justly be questioned, whether the description of them is not
taken from the practice of their own times, a thing frequent enough with men of that profession. These beaks were at first long and high, but afterwards it was found more convenient to have them short and firm , and
placed so low as to pierce the enemy's ships under water ; this was the invention of one Aristo, a Corinthian, who communicated it to the Syra
cusans, in their wars with the Athenians, against whom it proved a con siderable advantage, for, by these new beaks, several of the Athenian men of war were overturned, or torn in pieces at the first shock. Above the

.
beak was another instrument, called it goepeBoxıs ; and it appears from ancient medals that the beaks themselves were usually adorned with vari ous figures of animals, &c.
' Erwrides were pieces of wood , placed on each side of the prow ,1 to
guard it from the enemy's beaks ; because prows are usually compared to faces, these were thought to resemble ears, whence their name seems to
have been derived, for those are mistaken that would have them belong to the hind-deck.
Καταστρώματα , σανιδώματα , or hatches , sometimes called καταφράγμα
To , whence we meet with vess meogayuivan, zaráqgaxtos, and tecta , covered ships, or men of war : which are frequently opposed to ships of
passage or burden, which were äogaxto, and apertæ , uncovered, or with out hatches : this covering was of wood , and erected on purpose for the soldiers, that they, standing, as it were, upon an eminence, might level their missive weapons with greater force and certainty against their ene
mies. In the primitive ages, particularly about the time of the Trojan war, we are told by Thucydides, that the soldiers used to fight upon the foremost and hindermost decks; and therefore, whenever we find Homer
speak of ixgía unos, which his scholiasts interpret hatches, we must under stand him as speaking of the parts which alone used to be covered in those
days. Thus he tells us of Ajax defending the Grecian ships against the attack of the Trojans :* νηών εκρί ” επώχετο μακρά βιβάσθω ». He march'd upon the hatches with long strides.
'And of Ulysses preparing himself for the encounter with Scylla, he speaks thus :5
εις ικρία νηός Εβαιος Upon the hatches of the foremost deck Πρώρης.
The other parts of the ship are said to have been first covered by the Tha sians,6
Besides the coverings of ships already mentioned , and called xatameáz Mezta , there were other coverings to guard the soldiers from their enemies,
called παραφράγματα, περιφράγματα , παραπετάσματα , παραβλήματα , προ xahúzepedra , in Latin plutei, and sometimes propugnacula . These were commonly hides, or such like materials, hung on both sides of the ship, as well to hinder the waves from falling into it, as to receive the darts cast from the adverse ships, that under these, as walls on both sides, the sol diers might, without danger, annoy their enemies.
Asapir, a certain machine, which, being usually a part of these ships, cannot be omitted in this place. It was a vast and massy piece of lead or
iron cast in the form of a dolphin , and hung with cords and pulleys to the sailyards or mast, which, being thrown with great violence into the adverse ships, either penetrated them , and so opened a passage for the rising floods, or by its weight and force sunk them to the bottom of the sea .?

Another difference betwixt men of war and other ships was, that the
former commonly had a helmet engraven on the top of their masts ."
CHAP. XVIII .
OF THE MARINERS AND SOLDIERS .
We are told by Thucydides, that among the ancients there were no dif ferent ranks of seamen , but that the same persons were employed in those
duties which were in later ages executed by different men, to whom they gave the several names of rowers, mariners, and soldiers ; whereas at first all these were the same men, who laid down their arms to labour at the
car , and perform what was farther necessary to the government of their ships, but, as often as occasion required, resumed them to assault their
enemies ; this appears everywhere in Homer, out of whom I shall adduce this one instance :
έρεται δ' εν εκάστη πεντήκοντα Each ship bad fifty rowers that were skill'd 'Εμβίβασαν τόξων ευ ειδότες.

for

the

were
thought

for

and

;
afterwards
,
when
the
art
of
naval
war
began
to
be
improved
,
it
was
presently
understood
that
any
one
of
the
fore

mentioned
occupations
was
enough
to
require
the
whole
time
and
application
of
the
persons
employed
therein
,
whence
it
became
customary
to
furnish
their
ships
of
war
with
the
three
following
sorts
of
men
:
'Ερέται κωπηλάται, called by Polybius οι υπάρχοντες, 3 and by the same
author,*with Xenophon , tà ringálata , though we are told by the scholi ast upon Thucydides that this is a name of very large extent, compre hending not only those that rowed, but all other persons in the ship, and
sometimes applied to any thing else contained therein . When ships had several banks of oars, the uppermost rowers were called Ipavires, and their bank θράνος :6 the lowest, θαλάμιοι, θαλαμίται, and θαλάμακες, and their bank θάλαμος: those in the middle ζυγίται , and μεσοζύγιοι , and all their banks, how many soever in number, Surá. Every one had a distinct oar , for, except in cases of necessity, one oar was never managed by above one person , as Scheffer hath proved at large; yet their labour and pay were
not the same ; for such as were placed in the uppermost banks, by reason of their distance from the water, and the length of their oars, underwent more toil and labour than those in the inferior banks, and therefore were rewarded with greater wages. The rowers in ships of burden were called

στρογγυλοναύται ! those in triremes τριηρέται” and the rest seem to have
had different appellations from the names of the ships they laboured in . Those that were foremost in the respective banks, and sat nearest the prow ,
were called spórw * 01, and on the other side, those who were placed next the stern were termed itinuro, as being behind their fellows. Their work was esteemed one of the worst and most wretched drudgeries, and there
fore the most notorious malefactors were frequently condemned to it ; for , besides their incessant toil in rowing, their very rest was uneasy , there being no place to repose their wearied bodies except the seats whereon
they had laboured all the day: therefore, whenever the poets speak of
their' ceasing from labour, there is mention of their lying down upon them .
The rest of the ship's crew usually took their rest in the same manner, only the masters, or persons of quality, were permitted to have clothes spread under them ,4 Such as would not be contented with this provision were looked upon as
soft and delicate, and unfit to endure the toil and hardships of war ; which
censure the Athenians passed upon Alcibiades, because he had a bed hung on cords,5
Næūtas, mariners, were exempt from drudging at the oar, but performed all other duties in the ship ; to which end , that all things might be carried on without tumult and confusion , every one had his proper office, as appears
from Apollonius and Flaccus' Argonautics, where one is employed in rear ing the mast, another in fitting the sailyards, a third in hoisting the sails, and the rest are bestowed up and down the ship, every one in his proper place : hence they had different titles, as from águivo , sails, the persons
appointed to govern them were called å Quevotal those who climbed up the ropes to descry distant countries or ships, were termed ogcouroséreb, and the rest in like manner. There were a sort of men inferior to the
former, and called pscovaūtai, who were not confined to any certain place or duty, but were ready on all occasions to attend on the rest of the sea
men, and supply them with whatever they wanted.6 The whole ship's crew were usually wicked and profligate fellosvs, without any sense of reli
gion or humanity, and therefore reckoned by Juvenal amongst the vilest rogues : 7 Invenies aliquo cum percussorejacentem , The bully match'd with rascals of his kind, Permixtum nautis, autfuribus, autfugitivis. Quacks, coffin -makers, fagitives, and sailors. There you're sure to find The soldiers who served at sea were, in Latin , termed classiarii, in
Greek επιβάται, either because they did επιβαίνειν τας νήας , ascend into
ships , or, από του επιβαίνειν καταστρώματα, from ascending the hatches where they fought. They were armed after the same manner with those
designed for land service, only there seems always to have been a greater number of heavy -armed men than was thought necessary by land ; for we

find in Plutarch , that of eighteen men employed to fight upon the hatches, in every one of the ships of Themistocles, only four were light-armed : in deed it highly imported them to fortify themselves in the best manner they could, since there was no possibility of retiring or changing places, but every man was obliged to fight hand to hand, and maintain his ground till
the battle was ended ; wherefore their whole armour, though in form usually
the same with that employed in land service, yet exceeded it in strength and firmness. Besides this, we find also some few instruments of war never used on land, the principal of which are these that follow : Aipatu saúüia xe ,2 spears of an unusual length , sometimes exceeding twenty cubits, whence they are called in Livy3 hasta longa , and by
Homer ξυστά ναύμαχα, and μακρά.4 Δρίτανος, 5 called by Appian δορυδρέπανον , by Diodorus 6 δρεπανηφόρος κε gria , was an engine of iron, crooked like a sickle, and fixed to the top of a long pole, with which they cut in sunder the cords of the sailyards, and thereby letting the sails fall down, disabled the light ships. Not unlike this was another instrument, armed at the end with a broad iron head, edged on both sides, with which they used to cut the cords that tied the
rudder to the ship . Kepaian 8 were engines to cast stones into the enemy's ships,
We find another engine mentioned by Vegetius, which hung upon the main -mast, and resembled a battering -ram ; for it consisted of a long beam and a head of iron , and was pushed with great violence against the sides
of adverse ships. Xsig ordngà , in Latin manus ferrea, was a grappling iron, which they cast out of an engine into the enemy's ship : it is said to have been first used in Greece by Pericles the Athenian ,9 at Rome by Duilius.10 Differ
ent from these were the ågroyes, harpagines, said to be invented by Anacharsis,11 the Scythian philosopher ; which, as Scheffer collects out of Athenæus, were hooks of iron hanging on the top of a pole, which being
secured with chains to the mast, or some other lofty part of the ship, and then cast with great force into the enemy's vessel, caught it up into the air. The means used to defeat these engines was to cover their ships with Irides, which cast off, or blunted, the stroke of the iron ,12
The dominion of the seas was not confined to any one of the Grecian states ; they were continually contending for empire, and, by various turns
of fortune, sometimes possessed, and again , in a few months or years, were dispossessed of it : the persons that enjoyed it longest, and maintained it
with the greatest fleet after Greece had arrived to the height of its glory, were the Athenians, who first began seriously to apply themselves to naval affairs about the time of Xerxes' invasion : the first that engaged them in
this enterprise was Themistocles, who, considering their inability to op

- pose the Persians by land , and the commodiousness of their situation for
naval affairs, interpreted the oracle that advised to defend themselves within walls of wood to this purpose , and prevailed upon them to convert . their whole time and treasure to the building and fitting out a fleet The money employed on this design was the revenue of the silver mines at
Laureotis, which had formerly been distributed among the people , who , by Themistocles persuasion , were induced to part with their income, that provision might be made for the public security. With this,a hundred
triremes were rigged out against Xerxes' numerous fleet, over which, by the assistance of their allies, they obtained an entire victory. Afterwards the number of their ships was increased, by the management of Lycurgus, the orator, to four hundred ;' and we are told by Isocrates, that the Athe nian navy consisted of twice as many ships as all the rest of the Greeks
were masters of: it was made up of two parts, one being furnished out by the Athenians themselves, the other by the confederates.
The fleet equipped at Athens was maintained after the manner pre
scribed by Themistocles, till the time of Demosthenes, who, to ingratiate himself with the commonalty, restored to them their ancient revenues, and devised a new method to procure money for the payment of seamen ,
and the construction of new men of war ; this he effected by dividing the
richer sort of citizens into oupe ogías, companies, which were obliged , ac cording to their several abilities, to contribute largely out of their own substance ; and, in times of necessity , it was frequent for men of estates
to rig out ships at their own expense, over and above what was required of them, there being a generous contention between the leading men in that
commonwealth, which should outdo the rest in serving his country . The remaining part of the fleet was composed of allies ; for the Athe nians understanding how necessary it was to their affairs to maintain the
dominion of the seas, would enter into no leagues or confederacies with any of their neighbours, but such as engaged themselves to augment their navy with a proportion of ships; which became a double advantage to the Athenians, whose fleet was strengthened by such accessions, whilst their allies were held in obedience, as it were , by.so many hostages , all which , upon any revolt, must needs fall into the hands of the Athenians. Those
states that were remote from the sea, or unable to fit out vessels of war, were obliged to send their proportion in money. These customs were first brought up after the second Persian war, when it was agreed, by the com mon consent of all the Greeks, that they should retaliate the injuries re ceived from the barbarians, by carrying the war into their own country,
and invading them with the whole strength of Greece, under the conduct
of the Athenians, who had at that time raised themselves a very high re
putation, by their mighty naval preparations, and the singular courage , wisdom , and humanity, of their two generals, Themistocles and Aristides. Afterwards, being grown great in power, and aiming at nothing less than 2 Panegyrica. 3 Xenophon, Histor. Græc. vi.

the sovereignty of all Greece, they won some by favours and specious pre tences, others by force of arms, to comply with their desires ; for their manner of treating the cities they conquered was to oblige them either to furnish money, paying what tribute they exacted , or to supply them with vessels of war, as Thucydides reports of the Chians, when subdued by the Athenians ;! Xenophon also,2 and Diodorus,3 mention the same custom : thus, by one means or other, the greatest part of the Grecian cities were drawn in to augment the Athenian greatness.
CHAP. XIX .
OF NAVAL OFFICERS.
There were two sorts of officers in all fleets ; one governed the ships and mariners, the other were intrusted with the command of the soldiers,
but had likewise power over the shipmasters and their crew ; these were, Eróraexos, raudoxos, or otparnyós, præfectus classis, the admiral, whose commission was different, according to the exigency of times and circum stances, being sometimes to be executed by one alone, sometimes in con
junction with other persons, as happened to Alcibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus, who were sent, with equal power, to command the Athenian fleet in Sicily ; their time of continuance in command was likewise limited by the people, and prolonged or shortened as they pleased. We read of Epaminondas,4 that, finding his country like to be brought into great dan ger upon the resignation of his office, he held it four months longer than
he was commissioned to do ; in which time he put a new face upon the Theban affairs, and by his wise management dispelled the fears they lay under : which done, he voluntarily laid down his power, but was no sooner divested thereof, than he was called to account for holding it so long, and narrowly escaped being condemned to death ; for it was feared that such a
precedent might, some time or other, be a pretence to ambitious spirits, having so great power intrusted in their hands, to enslave the common wealth . The same reason seems to have been the cause of the Lacedæ
monian law , by which it was forbidden that any person should be admiral above once, which nevertheless stood them in no good stead, it thereby
often happening that they were forced to commit their feet to raw and unexperienced commanders.

therein. The captains of other men of war were dignified with titles taken
from the vessels they commanded , as revonxbytogos, &c.
The officers that had care of the ships were , ' Agxoxußiguntas, those who were intrusted with the care and manage ment of all marine affairs, to provide commodious harbours, to direct the
course of the fleet, and order all other things concerning it, except those which related to war.
Kußsgrýtns, the master, or pilot, had the care of the ship, and govern ment of the seamen therein, and sat at the stern to steer : all things were managed according to his direction : it was therefore necessary that he
should have obtained an exact knowledge of the art of navigation , which was called xußeguntenh Tigun , and chiefly consisted in these three things : 1. In the right management of the rudder, sails, and all the engines used in navigation. 2. In the knowledge of the winds and celestial bodies,
their motions and influences. 3. In the knowledge of commodious har bours, of rocks, quicksands, and other occurrences on the sea.!
As to the heavenly bodies, they were observed by sailors upon a two fold account, being of use to them in prognosticating the seasons, and as guides which way to shape their course . The principal of those used in
foretelling, were Arcturus, the Dog - star, Aræ, Orion, Hyades, Hædi, Castor and Pollux, Helena, &c. It was likewise customary to take notice of various omens offered by sea -fowls, fishes, and various other things, as
the murmuring of the floods, the shaking and buzzing noise of trees in
the neighbouring woods, the dashing of the billows against the shore, and many more , in all which good pilots were nicely skilled. As to the direc
tion in their voyage , the first practitioners in the art of navigation , being unacquainted with the rest of the celestial motions, steered all the day by the course of the sun , at night betaking themselves to some safe harbour,
or resting on the shore, and not daring to adventure to sea till their guide was risen to discover their way : that this was their constant custom may be observed from the ancient descriptions of those times.? Afterwards the Phoenicians, whom some will have to be the first in ventors of navigation , discovered the motions of some other stars,3 The
Phoenicians we find to have been directed by Cynosura, or the lesser
Bear-star,4 which was first observed , as some are of opinion , by Thales, the Milesian , who was originally a Phoenician ;5 whereas the mariners of Greece, as well as other nations, steered by the greater Bear, called He lice : whence Aratus: - Ελίκη γε μεν άνδρες 'Αχαιοί Helice always is the Grecians' guide, Είν ' άλι τεκμαίρονται ένα χρή νήας άγινείν .

Ilgogsòs, or # gwpárns, was next under the master, and had his place in the head of the ship , as his name imports. To his care was committed
the tackling of the ship , and the rowers, who had their places assigned by
him , as appears of Phæax who performed this office in the ships of The seus. We find him everywhere assisting the master at consultations con
cerning the seasons, places, and other things.3

Torngatans, was a musician, who, by the harmony of his voice and in
strument, raised the spirits of the rowers, when weary with labour and ready to faint.? Another, it may be the chief, use of music, was to direct
the rowers, that they, keeping time therewith, might proceed in a regular and constant motion , lest, by an uncertain impulse of their oars, the course
of the ship should be retarded . This music was called víry kapos, or rò
τριηρικόν μέλος.. Siofo , ravoúrazes, custodes navis, were obliged to take care that the ship received no damage by bulging upon rocks or otherwise ;10 whence, in the night especially, we find them employed in sounding and directing the ship with long poles :1 Ως ναοφύλακες νυκτίρου ναοκληρίας As those who sail, with caution in the dark Πλήκτρoις απεθύνουσιν ουρίαν τρόπιν.. Guide and direct with poles the wandering bark . Toixaexos were either those who had the charge of the oīgos tās vzès, or
sides of the ship ;12 or of the soixon, or orcizas são égszwy, the banks of rowers ,
Several other names of officers occur, as Tapios, who distributed to every man his share of victuals, being usually the same with the reasuo TNS , but sometimes it may be distinct from him.13
'Έσχαρεύς, 14 was a person whose business lay περί την εσχάραν, αλout the fire, and therefore is by some thought to have been the cook ; by others, the priest who offered sacrifices.

OF THEIR VOYAGES, HARBOURS, &c.
When it was designed that the fleet should put to sea , the signal being given by the admiral, the mariners hauled the ship into the water ; for it was customary , when they came into harbour, to draw the sterns to dry
land, to prevent their being tossed and dissipated by the waves.I It was also customary for seamen , underpropping their ships with their
shoulders, to thrust them forwards into the sea.? This was sometimes per formed by levers and spars ofwood,over which ships were rolled into the deep ;
these were called φάλαγγες , φαλάγγια, and μοχλοί.4 Buttoremedy the great trouble and difficulty of these methods, Archimedes, the Syracusan, obliged his countrymen with the ingenious contrivance of an engine called helix , by which the ships were with great facility removed from the shore . To
do this, they called την πρύμναν κινείν, or νήας κατερύειν είς άλα . Before they embarked, the ships were adorned with flowers and gar
lands, which were tokens of joy and mirth , and omens of future prospe
rity .? Because no success could be expected in any enterprise without the divine blessing and assistance, they invoked the protection of their gods
by solemn prayers and sacrifices, which, as they offered to other deities, so more especially to those who had any concern or command in the sea, to the winds and tempests, to the whole train of marine gods and god
desses, but, above all, to Neptune, the great emperor of the sea.8 Nor was it enough that they themselves petitioned the gods for safety and success, but all the multitudes that thronged on such occasions to the
shore earnestly recommended them to the divine protection , and joined their fervent prayers for their deliverance from all the dangers they were going to encounter.9
When this was done, it was usual to let fly a dove,10 which, no doubt, was looked on as an omen of safe return , because that bird is not easily forced to relinquish its habitation, but when driven away, delights to re
turn . They then put to sea, the signal being given by a shout, by sound of trumpet, and several other ways ; in the night it was usually given by
torches lighted in the admiral's galley.11 The ships were usually ranged in the following order : in the front went
the lighter vessels, after these followed the men of war led on by the ad miral, whose ship was commonly distinguished from the rest by the rich
ness of her ornaments. Last of all came up the vessels of burden . If the
winds were high, or seas dangerous, they were extended out at length ,

sailing one by one ; but at other times they went three or more in a breast.
When they arrived at any port where they designed to land, the first thing they did was to run their ships backwards upon their hiud -decks, in order to tack about ; this they called ésà agúrvar, or reúprav upobsoles,
a phrase which is elegantly applied by Thucydides to those that retreat fighting, and stil facing their enemies. They then tacked about, which
they termed iristeepuv ,2 turning the heads of their ships to the sea.s. The rowers now ceased from their labours, and rested their oars ; which
the Greeks called trixavaimu væūv, the Latins inhibere remos : these they hung upon pins, and lest they should be broken by the floods, they hung them not so as to reach the water, but upon the sides of their ships.5 Being safely landed, they discharged whatever vows they had made to
the gods ; besides which they usually offered a sacrifice, called åroßari
gros, to Jupiter, surnamed 'Aroßatágios, for enabling them éroßaivou šx TÔn yeâv, to quit their ships, and recover the land . Their devotions were sometimes paid to Nereus, Glaucus, Ino, and Melicertes, the Cabiri, and
other gods of the sea , but more especially to Neptune, who was thought to
have a peculiar care of all that travelled within the compass of his do minions.6
They who had escaped a shipwreck , or any other danger at sea , were more particularly obliged to offer a present to the gods, as a testimony of their gratitude. To this they sometimes added the garment in which they had escaped, and a tablet, containing an account of their deliverance . If
nothing else remained , they at least cut off their hair, and consecrated it
to their protectors. Thus Lucilius affirms of himself in the epigram :8
Γλαύκω και Νηρηί, και "Ινοί , και Μελικέρτη, Και βυθίω Κρονίδη, και Σαμόθρηξι θεοίς , Σωθείς εκ πελάγους Λουκίλλιος, ώδε κέκερμαι Τας τρίχας εκ κεφαλής , άλλο γάς ουδέν έχω.
Hence Petronius Arbiter calls shaving their hair, naufragorum ultimum
volum , the last vow of men in shipwreck .*9 It was also customary for those who had escaped any other danger, particularly ix meyáhou owl'évtis
vorbu, 'for such as had recovered from any dangerous sickness, to sliave oft their hair.10 The Egyptians used to shave their own hair when they paid their acknowledgments to the gods for the recovery of their children.Il
Harbours were places rendered commodious, either by nature or art, for the reception of ships, and to defend them from the violence of winds and waves : the former were usually at the mouth of a river, or in a creek of the sea, under the covert of some lofty promontory ; the latter were vast
piles, or heaps of earth and other materials, cast up in the form of a semi
circle, with arms of a vast length extended into the sea ; these were called

xnaad, from their resemblance to the claws of crabs, or árgas Toũ hous ros ; or áxtai,3
Cicero termsthem cornua . For the security of the ships inclosed in
them, it was usual to fix to the two ends vast chains or booms, as appears of the Syracusan harbour, mentioned in Frontinus : 5 nor was it unfrequent to guard them with great pales, fortified against the water with pitch : hence havens are sometimes termed in Latin claustra, in Greek xasírus.6 On
both sides of the mole were strong towers ,? which were defended in the night, and in all times of danger, by garrisons of soldiers.8 Not far dis
tant was a watch -tower, with lights to direct mariners ; this was called pharos, a name which originally belonged to a little island in the mouth
of the river Nile, where the first of these towers was built, but was after wards naturalized both at . Greece and at Rome,
The second part of the harbour was termed otója, in Latin ostium and fauces, from its being the mouth or entry between the arms of the semi circle .
Muxós was the inmost part of the harbour, nearest to the shore, and most secure from the waves, insomuch that there ships were often suffered
to lie loose ; whereas, in other parts of the harbour, they were usually either chained to the land , or lay at anchor. It was distinguished into several partitions by walls, erected for the most part of stone, under the covert of which the vessels had protection ; these places were called quon,
and saúdoxos, and, together, composed what was called yavataljós. Here were likewise the docks, in which ships were built, or careened and
dragged to land ; these were named ysúroixos, 10 {FIOTIK ,11 yságra, 12 &c. The adjacent places were usually filled with inns and houses13 of a less reputable description , to which the mariners, merchants, and artificers of all sorts, who flocked thither in great numbers, resorted. Most harbours
were adorned with temples, or altars, where sacrifices were offered to the
tutelary deities of the place, and presidents of the sea ; mention of which
we find, in several places, and particularly in Homer,14 who speaks of a cave in the haven of Ithaca dedicated to the Naiades.
Scheffer will have stationes navium to differ from the former in this,
that here ships were not laid up for any considerable time, but remained only till they were supplied with water or other necessaries, or on some other short occasions. They had several names, as öguos,15 ©Pageou ,16 ivogo

the shore; whence ogrão,20 is explained by erooudsúsiv, which imports their,being among the waves ; and by ägu ir ' éyxueñv, which answers

in some measure to the Latin phrase in Livy, in anchoris'stare, ' to ride at anchor.
In times of war they defended themselves with fortifications on both
sides, but made after a different manner : towards the land they fortified themselves with a ditch and parapet, or wall built in the form of a semi circle, and extended from one point of the sea to another. This was
sometimes defended by towers, and beautified with gates, through which they issued forth to attack their enemies.!
Towards the sea, or within it, they fixed great pales of wood , like those in harbours; before these the vessels of burden were placed in such order
as they might be instead of a wall, and give 'protection to those within ; but this seems only to have been practised when the enemy was thought
superior in strength , and raised in them great apprehensions of danger. At other times all they used to do was to appoint a few of their ships to
observe their enemy's motions; these were termed populaxides, and the
soldiers πύρσουροι , or πυρσουρίδαι , from πυρσός, α torch , with which they intimated the approach of the enemy. When their fortifications were
thought strong enough to secure them from the assault of their enemies, it was customary to drag their ships to shore, which the Greeks called
iww.xsīv, the Romans subducere .' Around the ships the soldiers placed their tents, as appears everywhere in Homer, Thucydides, and others :
but this seems only to have been practised in winter, when their enemy's
fleet was laid up, and could not assault them ; or in long sieges, and when they lay in 'no danger from their enemies by sea, as in the Trojan war, where the defenders of Troy 'never once attempted to encounter the Greeks in a sea -fight: at other times the ships only lay at anchor, or were tied to the shore, that upon any alarm they might be ready to receive the enemy.
CHAP. XXI.
OF THE ENGAGEMENTS , &c. BY SEA ,
In preparing for an engagement at sea, the first business was to disburden
their ships of war of all provisions, and other lumber, not necessary in the action , 'lest by too heavy a load they should be rendered unwieldy, and unfit for service, being neither able with force and vigour to assail their enemies, nor by lightly tacking about to avoid their onsets. When
the enemy appeared in view, they took down their sails, ' lowered
their masts, and secured whatever might expose them to the winds, choosing rather to be governed by oars, which they could manage at their pleasure. On this account we read that Hanno the Carthaginian ,

being pursued by a fleet of Dionysius the Sicilian , to which he was much
inferior in strength and number, and having no way to make his escape, took down his sails as preparing to fight; whereby, decoying the Sicilians
to do the like, whilst they were busy and observed him not, he unexpect edly hoisted again his sails, and made away.! As to their order of battle, that was varied as time, place , and other circumstances required ; being sometimes formed like a half-moon , and
called otónos penyosidàs, the horns jutting out towards the enemy, and con taining the ablest men and ships ; sometimes, on the contrary , having its belly nearest the enemy, and its horns turned backwards, whence it was termed xugrin grupárağis: nor was it unusual to range them in the form of
a circle which they called xúxãoy Túttav ; or, to mention no more, in the figure of the letter V,? with the horns extended in a direct line, and meet
ing at the end ; which order was named imix @uths magáražis, in Latin forceps ; and was usually encountered by the enemies ranged in the same order inverted, whereby they resembled the figure of a wedge or beak , whence it was called cuneus or rostrum ; this enabled them to penetrate into the body of the adverse battle. Before they joined battle, both parties invoked the gods to their assist ance by prayers and sacrifices ; and the admirals going from ship to ship
in some of the lighter vessels, exhorted their soldiers in a set oration to
behave themselves like men : then all things being in readiness , the sig nal was given by hanging out of the admiral's galley a gilded shield , as we read in Plutarch , or a red garment or banner ;3 which was termed
aiqsuv onusia . During the elevation of this, the fight continued , and by its depression , or inclination towards the right or left, the rest of the ships were directed in what manner to attack their enemies, or retreat from them . To this was added the sound of trumpets, which was begun in
the admiral's galley, and continued round the whole fleet ;6 it was like wise usual for the soldiers, before the fight, to sing a pean , or hymn ,' to Mars, and after the fight, another to Apollo.
The fight was usually begun by the admiral's galley ,8 and was carried on in two different manners ; for not only did the ships engage one an
other, and by their beaks and prows, and sometimes their sterns, endea
vour to dash in pieces, or overset and sink their opposers ; but the soldiers also annoyed their enemies with darts and slings, and , upon their nearer approach , with swords and spears.9

When a town was besieged by sea, they used to environ its walls and harbour with ships ranged in order from one side of the shore to the other,
and so closely joined together with chains and bridges on which armed men were placed, that without breaking their order, there could be no
passage from the town to the sea ; this leaguer Diodorus calls sūra.? The better to prevent any attempts of the besieged, Demetrius is said to have invented a sort of boom armed with spikes of iron , which swam upon
the waters ; this he placed at the mouth of the harbour of Rhodes ; when
he besieged that city . Sometimes they blocked up the harbour, or made a passage to the town by raising a vast mole before it, as we read of Alex ander, in the siege of Tyre ;s or by sinking ships filled with stones and sand, as we find practised by the Romans.
The attacks were usually carried on by men standing upon bridges be tween the ships, and thence with darts and stones forcing the besieged
from their walls. Thus Alexander in the siege of Tyre so ordered his galleys, that two of them being joined at the head, and the stern somewhat distant, boards and planks were laid over in the fashion of bridges, for sol diers to stand upon , who were in this manner rowed close to the wall, where, without any danger, they threw darts at their enemies, being sheltered behind the fore- decks of their own galleys . Here also, that they might throw their missive weapons with greater advantage, and batter the walls with their rams and other engines, they erected towers so high as to command the city walls, from which having repelled the defenders, they, by this means, had opportunity to descend by ladders.
The besieged were not at a loss for ways of defeating these stratagems ; they pulled asunder with iron hooks the ships linked together ; the pas sage to the town they blocked up in the same manner the enemy had done that of the harbour, or otherwise :5 if they could not hinder their approach,
they failed not to gall them with darts, stones, fire-balls, melted pitch or metals, and many other things , and lastly, to trouble you no farther, it was frequent for those in the town to destroy the vessels and works of the besiegers by fire- ships, as we find done by the Tyrians, who, taking a large vessel, put a great quantity of ballast into the stern , covered the head with pitch, tar, and brimstone, then by the help of sails and oars, brought her close to the Macedonian fortress, where having set the com
bustible matter on fire, they retreated into boats prepared for that purpose : the fire immediately seized the towers of the fortification , and by the help of torches and fire-brands cast by those in the boats, the work itself took fire, and that vast pile on which so much time and labour had been be

likewise meet with amongst the Rhodians..
CHAP. XXII.
OF THE SPOILS , MILITARY REWARDS, PUNISHMENTS, &c,
VICTORY being obtained, the conquerors sailed home triumphant, lader with the spoils of their enemies, and dragging after them the captive ships, as appears from the instances of Alcibiades in Plutarch , and of
Lysander in Xenophon : the latter, according to the invariable custom of the Greeks, had crowns or garlands presented him by all the confederate
cities of Sparta, as he passed by them ; which custom was constantly prac tised by the Greeks, from whom it seems to have been derived to Rome : nor was the admiral or the soldiers and mariners only adorned with gar lands, but their ships were likewise bedecked with them ;t whereby the
Rhodians were once reduced to extreme danger; for their enemies, having made themselves masters of their ships, crowned them with laurel, and
entering them, were received with great joy into Rhodes ;) which strata gem was frequently practised in Greece.6 Nor were they beautified with
garlands only, but hung likewise about with wrecks and broken pieces of the ships destroyed in battle: especially the õpidota , expootóns , xógure Be, and other omamental parts, which the conquerors were industrious in
procuring to grace their triumphs.7 These they called åxpwrugia , and to deprive a ship of them dxgwangsáluv. In this manner the victors returned home, filling the sea with their shouts, acclamations, and hymns ; which were sweetened by the harmony of musical instruments.
Being received into the city, they went straightway into the temples of the gods, where they dedicated the choicest of their spoils. Thus we read , that the Syracusans having defeated the Athenians, and the Rhodians, after a victory over Demetrius, filled the temples of their gods with wrecks of ships. Nor was it unusual to present entire vessels to them ; for we
find that Phormio, having overcome the Lacedæmonians, consecrated a ship to Neptune ;10 and the Greeks, after their great victory over the Per
sians at Salamis, are reported to have dedicated three Phænician tri remes. 11
Having paid their homage to the gods, they bestowed the remainder of their spoils in the porticos, and other public places of their city, to pre
serve the memory of their victory : to which end they were likewise hon oured with statues, inscriptions, and trophies, the last of which were

sometimes erected in their own country, but more frequently near the
place where they had overthrown their enemies, and were adorned with arms, and broken wrecks of ships, which, for that reason , were looked on as a sign and testimony of victory. Thus 1 in a fight between the Athe nians and Corinthians, where both parties made pretensions to victory ,
the former were by most esteemed to have the justest title to it, as having possessed themselves of their enemy's wrecks; and king Philip, though worsted by Attalus, yet because he made a shift to keep his fleet among the adverse party's wrecks, would have persuaded the world that the day was his own.2
These were the principal rewards peculiar to those who had served
their country by sea ; they seem also to have been frequently honoured with others, but these were common to those who had been useful in other stations.
The chief punishment was whipping with cords, which was sometimes inflicted on criminals , having their lower parts within the ship , and their
heads thrust out of port-holes, and hanging into the sea . Thus one Sey lax, master of a Myndian vessel, was treated by Megabetes for not being careful to keep watch and ward_3 There seems to have been a punishment by which offenders were tied with cords to a ship , and dragged in the waters till they were drowned ; Scylla was so treated by Minos, after she had betrayed to him her father and kingdom . Others were thrown alive into the sea.
' Avaupázok, or such as refused to serve at sea after a lawful summons, were, at Athens, themselves and their posterity, condemned to atipia, ignominy, or disfranchisement . AlitovaūTui, deserters, were not only bound with cords and whipped ,5 but also had their hands cut off,6

ANTIQUITIES OF GREECE .
BOOK IV. -CHAP. I.
OF THE FUNERALS OF THE GREEKS.
Pluto was the first who instructed the Greeks ' in the manner of perform ing their last offices to the deceased ; hence the inventors of fables have assigned him a vast and unbounded empire in the shades below , and con stituted him supreme monarch of all the dead. And since there is
scarcely any useful art, the inventor of which was not reckoned amongst the gods, and believed to patronize and preside over those artificers he had
first instructed, no wonder if he who taught the rude and uncivilized ages what respect, what ceremonies, were due to the dead , had the honour to be numbered amongst the deities of the first rank, since the duties be
longing to the dead were accounted of far greater importance , and the
neglect of them a crime of a blacker character, than those required by the living : for the dead were ever held sacred and inviolable even amongst the most barbarous nations; to defraud them of any due respect was a greater and more unpardonable sacrilege than to spoil the temples of the
gods: their memories were preserved with a religious care and reverence, and all their remains honoured with worship and adoration ; hatred and
envy themselves were put to silence, for it was thought a sign of a cruel and inhuman disposition to speak evil of the dead, and prosecute revenge
beyond the grave: no provocation was thought sufficient to warrant so
foul an action : the highest affronts from themselves whilst alive, or after
wards from their children, were esteemed weak pretences for disturbing
their peace, Offenders of this kind were not only branded with disgrace and infamy, but, by Solon's laws, incurred a severe penalty.2 But of all the honours paid to the dead , the care of their funeral rites was the greatest and most necessary ; for these were looked upon as a debt
so sacred, that such as neglected to discharge it were thought accursed ; hence the Romans called them justa, the Greeks δίκαια , νόμιμα, νομιζό .
preva , iAsja, 6014 , &c. , all which words imply the inviolable obligations which nature has laid upon the living to take care of the obsequies of the dead . And no wonder that they were thus solicitous about the interment

of the dead, since they were strongly possessed with an opinion that their souls could not be admitted into the Elysian shades, but were forced to wander desolate and without .company, till their bodies were committed
to the earth ; and that, if they never had the good fortune to obtain human burial, the time of their exclusion from the common receptacle of the
ghosts was no less than a hundred years ; whence in most of the poets, we
meet with passionate requests of dying men or their ghosts, after death, for this favour. I will only give you one out of Homer ;' who introduces the soul of Elpenor earnestly beseeching Ulysses to perform his funeral rites :
Νύν δε σε τών όπιθεν γουνάζομαι, ου παρεόντων , By thy fond consort! by thy father's cares ! Πρός τ' αλόχου και πατρός , ός έτρεφε τυτθον εόντα, By lov'd Telemachus's blooming years ! Τηλεμάχου 9 ', όν μούνον ένα μεγάροισιν έλειπες There pious on my cold remains attend, Μη μ ' άκλαυστον , αθαπτον ιών όπιθεν καταλείπεις There call to mind thy poor departed friend !

This was the reason why, of all imprecations, the greatest was to wish that a person might άταφος εκπίπτειν χθονός , die destitute of ourial ; and of all forms of death the most terrible was that by shipwreck , as in it
the body was swallowed up by the deep : whence Ovid , though willing to resign his miserable life, yet prays against this death : Demitte naufragium , mors mihi munus erit. Death would my soul fronx anxious troubles ease,

558 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
This, in cases of necessity, was looked upon- as enough to gain the ghost's admission into the dominions of Pluto, and to free such as happened upon their bodies from the fear of being haunted, yet was far from afford ing them entire satisfaction ; wherefore, such as had been interred clan destinely, or in haste, and without the customary solemnities, if afterwards
good fortune discovered them to any of their friends, were honoured with a second funeral.?
Nor was it sufficient to be honoured with the solemn performance of their funeral rites, unless their bodies were red for burial by their relations, and interred in the sepulchres of their fathers ; the want of these
requisites was looked upon by themselves and their surviving friends as a very great misfortune, and not much inferior to death itself. Thus Leon
idas the Tarentine, in his epitaph , complains
Πολλών απ ' Ιταλίης κείμαι χθονός, έκ τε Τάραντος From my dear native land remote I lie, Πάτρης , τούτο δέ μοι πικρότερον θανάτου. O, worse than death ! the thought is misery,2-P.
Thus too Electra in Sophocles, having preserved Orestes from Clytæm nestra, by sending him into a foreign country , and many years after hear ing he had ended his days there, wishes he had rather perished at first, than after so many years' continuance of life, have died from home, and been destitute of the last offices of his friends.
For this reason , the ashes of such as died in foreign countries were usually brought home and interred in the sepulchres of their ancestors, or
at least in some part of their native country ; it being thought that only the same mother which gave them life and birth was fit to receive their remains, and afford them a peaceful habitation after death . Hence
ancient authors afford us innumerable instances of bodies conveyed , some times by the command of oracles, sometimes by the good will of their friends from foreign countries to the sepulchres of their fathers, and with
great solemnity deposited there. Thus Theseus was removed from Scy rus to Athens, Orestes from Tegea, and his son Tisamenes from Helice to Sparta, and Aristomenes from Rhodes to Messene.
Nor was this pious care limited to persons of free condition , but slaves also had some share therein : for we find the Athenian lawgiver com
manding the magistrates called demarchi, under a severe penalty, to solemnize the funerals, not so much of citizens, whose friends seldom failed of paying the last honours, as of slaves, who frequently were desti tute of decent burial .
But if any person was backward in paying due respect to his dead
friends, or sparing in his expenses upon their obsequies and monuments, the government looked upon him as void of humanity and natural affec tion, and excluded him from any office of trust and honour; for one special
inquiry concerning the lives and behaviour of such as appeared candidates
for the magistracy at Athens was, whether they had taken due care in

celebrating the funerals, and adorning the monuments of their relations, To appear cheerful and gay before the ordinary time of mourning expired,
was also matter of no small scandal; for we find it objected by Æschines to Demosthenes, as a crime of a very heinous nature , that after the death
of his only daughter, he sacrificed to the gods in white apparel, and adorned with garlands, before due respect was paid tothe memory of such a relation ,
The great concern they had about funerals may farther appear from the respect paid to persons officiating therein ; for we find that the Cretan
acTaraŪTai, who had the care of funerals, were reverenced equally with
their priests ; and when the laws of Crete permitted to steal from others, as was likewise customary at Sparta, these men were exempted from the common calamity, it being looked on as a kind of sacrilege to convey away any part of their goods.2
There were nevertheless some so unhappy, as, by their actions whilst
alive, or from the aggravating circumstances of their death, to be unwor
thy of all title to the common funeral rites, and some to any funeral at all. Such were these that follow :
1. Public or private enemies; for though it was looked upon as inhuman to deny an enemy the common privilege of nature , yet we find it prac tised by the ancient Greeks upon some extraordinary provocation. Homer has introduced Ulysses threatening Socrus therewith ;' Hector likewise promising the same treatment to Patroclus ;" and Achilles revenging his
cruelty by the like usage of him . The same poet has furnished us with
several instances of heroes made xvoù réaanega , a sport to dogs, and xúveron oiwvoisi ti šaágia , a prey to birds and beasts. No better treat
ment had the bones of Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, when treacherously murdered by Orestes . And however this might be thought the practice
of primitive and uncivilized men, yet there are not instances wanting of it in more refined ages ; for Lysander, the Spartan admiral, having routed
the Athenian fleet, caused Philocles, one of their commanders, and four thousand Athenian prisoners, to be put to death , and refused to give them human burial,?
2. Such as betrayed or conspired against their country. On which account Aristocrates being convicted of treason against the Arcadians, was stoned to death , and cast out of the bounds of their country unburied ;9 for it was thought but reasonable, that villains conspiring the ruin of their
country should be deprived of all privilege in it. Pausanias likewise, after he had delivered Greece from the Persians, being found , upon some
discontent, to maintain a correspondence with them, was starved to death, and denied burial ;10 and the famous Phocion being unjustly condemned by the Athenians, as conspiring to deliver the Piræus into their enemies'

hands, had his body cast out of Attica, and a severe penalty was decreed against any that should honour it with interment. So exact were they in the observation of this custom , that when the pestilence raged at
Athens, and the oracle gave out that the only remedy was to fetch the bones of Themistocles from Magnesia, they refused to do it publicly , but conveying them privately , and as it were by stealth, hid them in the
ground. Amongst the betrayers of their country, we may reckon those
who were not active in defending it, for they were likewise frequently denied human burial. Hence Hector is introduced by the poet, threat ening this punishment to all who would not help him in destroying the Grecian fleet:
« Ον δ' άν έγών απίνειθι νεών ετέρωθι νοήσω , And whom I find far lingering from the ships, Αυτού οι θάνατον μητίσσομαι' ουδέ νυ τον γε Wherever, there he dies ; no funeral fires Γνωτοί το γνωται το πυρός λελάχωσι θανόντα , Brother on him, or sister, shall bestow, 'Αλλά κύνες ερύουσι προ άστους ημετέροιο. But dogs shall rend him in the sight of Troy.
Some scholiasts would have this the first example of the practice I am
speaking of, but Homer sufficiently refutes this opinion, by making Aga memnon threaten the same punishment to the Greeks in the second Iliad :3
"Ον δε κ' εγών απάνευθε μάχης εθέλοντα νοήσω Who dares to tremble on this signal day ; Μιμνάζειν παρα νησί κορωνίσιν, ού οι έπειτα That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power " Αρκιον εσσείται φυγέειν κύνας, ήδ' οιωνούς. The birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour. Who dares inglorious in his ships to stay,
Before this instance, Palamedes being condemned as a traitor by the treachery of Ulysses, had wanted burial, had not Achilles and Ajax, in opposition to the commands of Agamemnon, adventured to pay him that office. Nor was the custom begun here ; for in the former age we find
Antigone buried alive by Creon for interring her brother Polynices, by whose means the famous war against Thebes was carried on , which is the subject of the Antigone of Sophocles.
3. To these we may subjoin tyrants, who were always regarded as ene mies of their country, and treated in the same manner as those that endea voured to betray it to foreign powers, there being no difference between a
domestic and foreign slavery. So the Pheræans having slain Alexander , who had cruelly oppressed them , threw his carcase to the dogs ; and Plu
tarch, speaking of the passage of Homer, where Nestor tells Telemachus, that had Menelaus found Ægisthus alive after his murder of Agamemnon and tyranny over the Myceneans, he would not have vouchsafed him
burial,5 observes, that this was not a late or modern custom, but practised
in the most early ages. The Myceneans were not insensible of the wrongs they had suffered by him ; and thinking him unworthy of an honourable
funeral, cast him , with the adulteress Clytæmnestra, out of the city, and there interred them.
4. On the same account, such as were guilty of suicide forfeited their

right to decent burial, and were secretly deposited in the ground, without the accustomed solemnities : for they were looked on as enemies to their country, whose services they deserted . For this reason Ajax, the son of Telamon , was not reduced to ashes, according to custom , but privately
interred ; it being declared by Calchas to be a profanation of the holy ele ment to consume in it the bodies of such as had occasioned their own
death . After the battle of Platæa, when the bodies of the slain were
honoured with the customary solemnities, Aristodemus alone, though he was generally confessed to have acquitted himself in the fight with the
greatest valour of any man in the army, lay unregarded, because he seemed resolved to sacrifice his life, as an atonement for the disgrace he
had contracted by surviving his fellow - soldiers at Thermopylæ . Yet, to
put a period to their lives on just occasions, seems rather to have been reputed the effect of a necessary and laudable courage than any way
criminal or blameworthy. Demosthenes and Hannibal are said to have
been constantly provided with an effectual poison with which they might dispatch themselves, before they should fall into their enemy's hands. Cato, Cleopatra, Brutus, Otho, and several others, have not at all lessered their esteem and character in the heathen world by becoming their own
executioners .' Plato himself, when he commands those only who, out of cowardice and unmanly fear, butchered themselves, to be interred in
lonesome and desolate places, without the ordinary solemnities, seems to excuse others, whom he thought compelled to it by a great disgrace, or any unavoidable and incurable misfortune :4 and it is no wonder if epicu
reans, who expected no future state, and stoics, who thought that all
things lie under an irresistible necessity, pursuant to their principles, abandoned themselves to such fatal courses. Many other instances might be produced , not only from the Greeks and Romans, but from the Indian
philosophers, and almost the whole heathen world.
5. To these we may add villains guilty of sacrilege,5 to inter whom was an affront to the deities they had robbed . The gods i were sometimes thought to inflict this punishment on such malefactors ; wherefore Archi
damus, the Spartan king, being slain in Italy, and deprived of burial, Pausanias 6 concludes it was a judgment upon him for assisting the Pho
cians in pillaging the city and temple of the Delphians. '15.
6. Persons killed with lightning, being thought hateful to the gods, were buried apart by themselves, lest the ashes of other men should receive
pollution from them . Hence Adrastus in Euripides, speaking of Capat neus, says , Η χωρίς , ιερέν ως νεκρόν, θάψαι θέλεις και Shall he apart be buried as accurs'da
Some are of opinion that they were interred in the place where they died ;" others collect out of Plutarch's Symposiacs, that they had no interment,

but were suffered to rot in the place where they fell, which it was unlawful for any man to approach ;' and which for this reason was hedged in , lest any person should unawares contract pollution from it. It may be observed in general, that all places struck with thunder were avoided, and fenced
round, out of a fancy that Jupiter having taken some offence, fixed on them that mark of his displeasure.
7. Those who wasted their patrimony forfeited the right of being buried in the sepulchres of their fathers : hence we find that Democritus was in
danger of wanting a burial-place for spending his paternal inheritance in travel to foreign countries, and searching after the mysteries of nature .
8. To these we may subjoin such as died in debt, whose bodies belonged at Athens to their creditors, and might not receive burial till satisfaction
was made. · Hence it is reported that Cimon had no other method to redeem the body of his father Miltiades, but by taking his debt and fetters upon himself.
9. Some offenders who suffered capital punishment were likewise de
prived of burial; those especially who died upon the cross or were impaled, whom they frequently permitted to be devoured by beasts and birds of prey .* The interpreters of fables allege that the punishment of Prometheus was an emblem of this. If the carcase was spared by the beasts, it com
monly remained upon the cross or pale till the weather consumed and putrefied it.5
This inhuman custom was practised not only in barbarous nations, but
by those who made greater pretensions to civility and good manners, as may appear from the dream of the daughter of Polycrates, who fancied
she saw her father's face washed by Jupiter and anointed by the sun ; which was accomplished not long after, when he was hung upon the cross , and exposed to the rain and sunbeams. Hither also may be referred the answer of Theodorus the philosopher, who being threatened with cru
cifixion by king Lysimachus, replied, “ Threaten those dreadful things to your effeminate courtiers, clothed in purple ; it matters not to Theodorus whether he rots on the earth , or in the air.''? 10. In some places it was customary to inter the bodies of infants who
had no teeth, without consuming them to ashes. If persons who had incurred public hatred had the good fortune to ob
tain burial, it was customary to leap upon their tombs, and to cast stones at them in token of detestation and abhorrence.9
Nor was it unfrequent to punish notorious offenders by dragging their
remains out of their retirement, and depriving them of the graves to which
they had no just pretension. Sacrilegious persons were commonly thus treated . A remarkable instance of this we find at Athens, where Cylo,

an ambitious nobleman , having seized the citadel, and being there straitly besieged, found means to escape with his brother, leaving his accomplices to the mercy of the besiegers ; they fled therefore, for protection to the altars, whence there was no method to draw them, but by promising them
pardon ; but no sooner had they left their sanctuaries, than the magistrates contrary to their covenant, put them to death ; upon which 'facts, them
selves were afterwards arraigned and banished, the deities so command
ing: nor was this alone satisfactory to divine vengeance, till their graves were rifled, and their remains, which had been conveyed into Attica, cast out of the country . I
Traitors were condemned to the same punishment: thus Phrynichus the Athenian , being arraigned and condemned for treason, some time after his funeral, was disinterred, and his relics thrown out of Attica.?
The same was sometimes inflicted upon enemies, when their malice and fury were extended beyond the ordinary bounds of martial law, and hur ried them on to despoil the sacred temples, and commit unsufferable
villanies ; otherwise, thus to treat a lawful and honourable enemy was al ways censured as barbarous and inhuman.
But, above all, it seems to have been the fate of tyrants, who were esteemed of all savage beasts the most hurtful and pernicious to mankind :3 hence Dion was extremely censured for hindering the Syracusans from breaking up the tomb of the elder Dionysius, and scattering his bones. Periander the Corinthian tyrant, by some reckoned amongst the seven
wise men , to prevent his incensed subjects from venting their fury upon his relics, contrived this method : he commanded two young men to walk
in the depth of the night in a certain path , and killing the first man they met, to bury him privately ; to dispatch and inter these, he commissioned four, after whom he sent others ; and after these a greater force, to treat the former in the same manner ; and thus the tyrant himself, meeting the
first pair, was interred in a place unknown to any man.4 Other methods were likewise used to secure peace to their ashes, the disturbance of which was looked on as the highest affront , and the greatest
misfortune in the world : thus, we find Medea resolving to bury her sons
in Juno Acræa’s temple, in the hope that the holiness of the place would protect them from the malice of her enemies.5

When any person was seized with a dangerous distemper, 'it' was usual to fix over his door a branch of rhamn and laurel.6,

The former was designed to keep off evil spirits: against which it was reputed a sovereign amulet; and on that account was sometimes joined
with the epithet αλεξίκακος.. 'The latter was added, to render the god of physic propitious, who, they thought, could purpose no harm to any place in which he found the monu ment of his beloved Daphne. These boughs they termed anthroug.
All sudden deaths of men were imputed to Apollo ; hence Hector , having lain unburied twelve days, and being, by the special favour of hea
ven, preserved fresh and free from corruption , Hecuba compares him to one dead, not of a lingering and wasting distemper, but by a sudden death ;
the former being thin and emaciated, the latter fat and fleshy :3
Nών δέ μοι ερσήεις και πρόσφατος εν μεγάροισι No mark of pain, or violence of face, Κείσαι , το δειλος, όν τ' αργυρότοξος 'Απόλλων Rosy and fair, as Phæbus' silver bow Oις αγανοίς βλέεσσιν επoιχόμενος κατέπεφταν Dismiss'd thee gently to the shades below. Yet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace, The sudden death of women was attributed to Diana :4
Την δε χολωσαμένη χρυσήνιος "Αρτεμις έκτα.. Incens'd Diana her deprivid of life.
The ground of this opinion was , that Apollo was usually taken for the sun , and Diana for the moon, which planets were believed to have a great influence on human life.5 All dead persons were thought to be under the jurisdiction of the infer
nal deities : and therefore no man could resign his life till some of his
hairs were cut, to consecrate him to them : hence Euripides introduces Death with a sword, going to cut off some of the hair of Alcestis, whom the Fates had adjudged to die instead of her husband Admetus :6 “Η δ' ούν γυνή κάτεισιν εις άδον δόμους, Be sure of that, to Pluto's dark domain. Στείχω δ' επ' αυτήν, ώς κατάρξωμαι ξίφει, I go, and with this sword assert my claim ; “Ιερός γάρ ούτος των κατά χθονός θεών, For sacred to the infernal gods that head,
« Οτου τόδ ' έγχος κρατός άγνίσει τρίχα, Whose hair is hallow'd by this charmed bløde.'
This woman goes ,
The ground of this opinion cannot be certainly defined ; but it seems not improbable that it proceeded from a ceremony at sacrifices, in which they
cut off some hairs from the victim's forehead, and offered them to the gods as first fruits of the sacrifice ; hence some imagine the same was thought
to be done by death upon men sent as victims to the infernal gods. When they perceived the pangs of death coming upon them , they made
supplications to Mercury, whose office it was to convey the ghosts to the regions below. An instance of this we have in a Cean matron, who,
being about to rid herself of life by a draught of poison, first called upon
Mercury to grant her a pleasant journey, and convey her to a commodious habitation in Pluto’s dominions. These prayers, whether offered to Mer

cuy or to any other god, were termed iğerúgios sugai, which is a general
name for all prayers before any man's departure, whether by death, or only to take a journey.1
Their friends and relations perceiving them at the point of resigning their lives, came close to the bed where they lay, to bid them farewell,
and to catch their dying words, which they never repeated without rever The want of opportunity to pay this compliment to Hector fur nishes Andromache with matter of lamentation2
They kissed and embraced the dying person , so taking their last fare well; this was a very ancient custom , being derived from the eastern
nations ; for we find in the holy writings, that Joseph fell upon his father
Jacob's neck , when he lay upon his death -bed, and kissed him . They likewise endeavoured to receive into their mouth his last breath , as fancy
ing his soul to expire with it, and to enter into their bodies: and at the
time of its departure it was customary to beat brazen kettles, which was thought an excellent method to drive away evil spirits and phantasms,
whose airy forms were not able to endure so harsh a noise :* they imagined that the dead man's ghost was thus secured from the Furies, and quietly
conveyed to a peaceful habitation in the Elysian fields. For it was an old
opinion , that there being two mansions in the infernal regions, one on the right hand, pleasant and delightful, the other on the left, appointed for the
souls of the wicked, the Furies were always ready to hurry departed souls to the place of torment."
Death and all things concerning it were ominous and ill-boding, and
are therefore frequently expressed in softening terms : thus to die is com monly termed å royivsobou , to which the Latin denasci answers ; sometimes
it is called oiy sober, to depart, and the dead oizópsvou: so also Chio, in an epistle to Plato , says, iš årégua w kresúroues, I will depart out of the world . In the same sense we find the Latin word abitio,6 which is a
synonymous term for death ; and abiit: as when Pliny writes, that Virgi nius Rufus plenus annis abiit, plenus honoribus,? . departed full of years and honours :' thus also the Greeks use Baßiwxe, he once lived ; and the Romans, vixit and fuit,8 Sometimes they used xéxunxs and xapóytis.9 But the most frequent are names taken from sleep, to which death bears
a near resemblance : whence the poets feign them to be brothers, and
zauãoba or sides are generally used for dying.10 So common was this way of speaking with the primitive Christians, that their burying -places were called xospentugia , cemeteries, which is a term of the same sense with Lycophron's súvasthene:11 ΣΧθωνος εις θυγατρός κυναστήριον.. To the sleeping place of Sithon's daughter.

CHAP . III.
OF THE CEREMONIES BEFORE THE FUNERAL .
As soon as any person had expired, they closed his eyes ; to do which , they termed καθαιρείν, συναρμόστειν, συγκλείειν, τους οφθαλμούς, οι τα βλέ Papa , &c.; this custom was so universally practised, that no person who has the least acquaintance with ancient writers can be ignorant of it. Hence xata Músiy came to be used for Ivhoxely, The design of this custom
seems to have been, not only to prevent that horror which the eyes of dead men, when uncovered , are apt to strike into the living ; but also to
satisfy the dying, who are usually desirous to die in a decent posture. Thus Polyxena, in Euripides, is said to have ordered herself in such a
manner, that nothing unfit to be seen should appear in her fall ;' and Augustus Cæsar, upon the approach of death , called for a looking - glass,
and caused his hair to be combed , and his fallen cheeks decently composed.2 For the same reasons, the mouth of the dead person was closed . Hence the ghost of Agamemnon, Homer, complains that his wife Clytæmpes
tra had neglected to perform this ceremony. This being done, the face
was covered : hence Hippolytus in Euripides, when about to expire, calls upon his father Theseus to do him that office :4
Κρύψαν δε μου πρόσωπον ώς τάχος πίπλους . Veil my face over quickly with a sheet.
Almost all the offices about the dead were performed by their nearest relations ; nor could a greater misfortune befall any person , than to want these last respects: Electra in Sophocles seems to prefer death itself before it. All the charges expended on funerals, and the whole care and man
agement of them , belonged also to relations, saving that persons of extra ordinary worth were frequently honoured with public funerals, the expenses of which were defrayed out of the exchequer. Thus we finds Democritus at Abdera, Zeno and Aristides at Athens, Epaminondas at
Thebes, Gryllus, Xenophon's son , at Mantinea, with many others, had their funerals celebrated at the public expense.
Before the body was cold, they composed all the members, stretching them out to their due length: this they termed éxt sively, or óptoūv,5
After
this
the
dead
body
was
washed.6
Plato
tells
us
,
that
Socrates
washed
himself
before
his
execution
,
to
save
the
women
the
trouble

for
this
office
was
commonly
performed
by
women
related
to

party
deceased
;
only
in
cases
of

others
were

ployed

OF
THE
MISCELLANEOUS
CUSTOMS
OF
GREECE.
567
some
places
there
were
vessels
in
the
temples
designed
for
this
use
;
these
were
called
in
Latin
labra
,
whence
some
derive
the
word
delubrum
.
"
This
done
,
the
body
was
anointed
."
Pliny
reports
that
the
Greeks
never
used
ointment
till
the
time
of
Alexander
the
Great,
when
they
had
it
conveyed
out
of
Persia
;
2
and
Homer,
though
frequently
mentioning
the
custom
of
anointing
the
dead
,
yet
useth
no
other
materials
beside
oil
.
But
Athenæus
will
by
no
means
allow
Homer's
oil
to
have
been
distinguished
from
púgov
,
or
ointment
properly
so
called
;
4
and
we
find
that
Solon
allowed
his
citizens
the
use
of
ointments
,
forbidding
only
slaves
to
perfume
them
selves
therewith
.
Hence
it
seems
probable
,
that
although
the
Greeks
might
not
have
any
knowledge
of
the
costly
ointments
with
which
the
Persians
furnished
them
,
yet
they
were
not
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
another
sort
.
After
the
body
was
washed
and
anointed
,
they
wrapped
it
in
a
garment
,
which
seems
to
have
been
no
other
than
the
common
pallium
or
cloak
they
wore
at
other
times
,
as
we
find
the
Romans
made
use
of
their
toga
.
Thus
Misenus
,
being
first
washed
and
anointed
,
then
,
as
the
custom
was
,
laid
upon
a
bed
,
was
wrapped
in
the
garments
he
had
usually
worn
.
?
After
this
,
the
body
was
adorned
with
a
rich
and
splendid
garment
;
hence
we
find,
that
before
Socrates
took
the
fatal
draught,
Apollodorus
brought
him
a
cloak
,
with
a
garment
of
great
value,
8
it
being
the
philoso
pher's
desire
to
prepare
himself
for
his
funeral
before
he
died
.
It
is
re
ported
also
,
that
Philocles
the
Athenian
admiral
,
being
overcome
and
sentenced
to
death
by
Lysander
the
Spartan
,
washed
himself
,
and
put
on
his
best
apparel
,
before
he
was
executed
.
The
whole
body
was
covered
with
this
garment
.
Its
colour
was
commonly
white
.
Whence
Artemi
dorus
reckons
it
an
unlucky
omen
,
and
a
presage
of
death
,
for
a
sick
per
son
to
have
white
apparel.11
This
colour
seems
to
have
been
used
to
denote
the
simplicity
and
harmlessness
of
the
dead
.
12
So
concerned
were
the
Greeks
about
this
garment,
that,
as
some
think
,
they
frequently
pre
pared
it
for
themselves
and
friends
during
life.13
But
it
may
be
disputed
,
whether
these
were
made
on
purpose
for
funeral
garments
,
or
only
designed
to
be
worn
,
and
applied
to
the
former
use
,
in
case
the
person
should
die
,
it
being
usual
to
wrap
dead
bodies
in
the
gar
ments
they
had
used
when
alive
.
The
latter
opinion
seems
more
probable
.
However
that
be
,
it
is
observable
,
that
the
Lacedæmonians
,
as
in
most
other
things
,
so
here
also
ran
counter
to
the
rest
of
the
Greeks
;
for
,
whilst
in
other
places
the
dead
were
clothed
with
costly
apparel,
which
none
except
the
poorer
sort
ever
wanted
,
the
Spartan
lawgiver
ordered
,
that
persons
of
the
greatest
valour
and
merit
should
be
buried
in
nothing
but
a
red
coat
,
which
was
the
common
habit
of
soldiers
;
to
others

denied ;l for he thought it wholly absurd and unreasonable that those who, through life, had been accustomed to contemn riches and superfluous orna ments, should be decked with them when dead, Nor were any ointments or costly perfumes used there, being looked on as conducing nothing to
the felicity of the dead , and unworthy of the Lacedæmonian gravity.
The next ceremony was the bedecking of the dead body with chaplets of flowers and green boughs . When persons of worth and character died in foreign countries, their remains were brought home in urns, and hon
oured with the ceremonies customary at other funerals, but moreespecially with this I am speaking of. All the cities through which the ashes of Demetrius were conveyed sent mourners to meet the sacred urn , with
others to perform the rites usual on such occasions, or at least to crown it with garlands . Philopoemen's relics were attended by captives in chains,
and his urn so covered with ribands and chaplets, that scarce any part of
it was to be seen . This ceremony was either taken from the games, in
which the conquerors were rewarded with crowns of leaves, as signifying that the dead had finished their course, or was designed to express the
unmixed and never-fading pleasures the dead were to enjoy upon their removal out of this painful and troublesome world ;6 for garlands were an
emblem of mirth and joyfulness, and therefore usually worn at banquets and festivals. The same may be observed of ointments and perfumes, the constant attendants of gaiety and pleasantness. To both these ceremonies we have an ingenious allusion of an old poet in Stobæus:
Ο μεν γαρ ούτως άν ποτ' έστεφανωμένοι , But 'cause we're sure of that more happy state, Προυκείμεθ ' &νθεσ' ουδε κατακεχρίσμενου, To which kind death doth every soul translate ,
Ει μη καταβάντας ευθέως πίνειν έδει . Which here by drinking we anticipate ?
Δια ταύτα γάρ τοι και καλούνται μακάριος,, For soon as death his fatal shaft has huri'd,
11άς γαρ λίγει τις , ο μακαρίτης ούχεται . And us transmitted to the other world,
Not that we less compassionate are grown, We drinking sign the immortal beverage, Do we at funerals our temples crown ,
And
in
sweet
joys
eternity
engage
.
Or
with
sweet
essences
adorn
our
hair
,
Hence they by every one are only said And all the marks of pleasing transport wear; To be right happy that are truly dead,
They next proceeded xgoritsolas, collocare, “ to lay out the dead body ;' sometimes they placed it upon the ground, sometimes upon a bier called λίκτρον, φέρτρον, or φέρετρον, which they bedecked with various sorts of
flowers. Some are of opinion that the corpse was first laid out upon the ground, and afterwards lifted upon a bier. This office, like most of the for mer ones, was performed by the nearest relations; whence Lysias, amongst other aggravating circumstances which attended the death of Eratosthenes,
who was condemned bythe thirty tyrants of Athens, reckons this as none of the least, that they laid him out, assuming thereby an office which belonged of right only to the nearest and most tender relations. Tiberius Cæsar is like
wise censured by Dio , not only as neglecting to visit Livia when sick, but because he laid her not out with his own hands when she was dead . The
place where the bodies were laid out was near the entrance of the house , which

dead
men
were
hence
called
a

.
The
reason
of
this
ceremony
was
,
that
all
persons
might
have
opportunity
to
search
whether
the
party
deceased
had
any
wounds
or
other
marks
of
an
untimely
and
violent
death
.
It
may
be
further
observed
,
that
the
feet
were
always
turned
toward
the
gate
.
By
this
ceremony
they
signified
that
they
were
never
to
return
after
being
carried
out
.
Whilst
the
body
lay
in
this
place
,
it
was
customary
to
give
it
constant
attendance
,
to
defend
it
from
any
violence
or
affront
that
might
be
offered
:

till

promised
to

When
any
person
died
in
debt
at
Athens
,
there
was
something
more
to
be
feared
;
for
the
laws
of
that
city
gave
leave
to
creditors
to
seize
the
dead
body
,
and
deprive
it
of
burial
till
payment
was
made
;
whence
the

his

Cimon
had
no
other
means
to
release
it
but
by
taking
upon
himself
his
father's
debt
and
fetters.5
Some time before interment, a piece of money was put into the mouth of the corpse , which was thought to be Charon's fare for wafting the de
parted soul over the infernal river. This was by some termed sagrúdovre ,6 by others δανάη, δανάκη, or δανάκης, from δάνος , α price ; or because it was given toīs devons, to dead men , so called from davà, dry sticks. It was only a single oborós ; Aristophanes, indeed, introduces Hercules tell
ing Bacchus he must pay two oboli .' But the comedian seems to speak this only by way of jeer to the judges in some of the Athenian courts, who were presented with two oboli at the end of their session ; whence Bac
chus presently subjoins: Φεύ, ές μέγα δύνασθον πανταχού δύο οβολώ.
I

Meursius, therefore interpreting this place of the common custom to wards the dead, and adding out of the scholiast that the price was after wards raised to three oboli, seems not to have reached the author's mean ing ; for nothing can be more plain than that the scholiast is to be
understood of the directixòs pecolòs, reward allowed the judges, which
was two oboli, and was afterwards increased to three. The ceremony was not used in those places which they fancied to be situated in the vicinity

Strabo particularly mentions that the Hermionians pleaded exemp tion ,
Besides this, the mouth of the corpse was furnished with a certain cake, composed of flour, honey, &c. and therefore called MERITTovra . This was
designed to appease the fury of Cerberus, the infernal door-keeper, and to procure of him a safe and quiet entrance .
The whole ceremony of laying out and clothing the dead , and some
times the interment itself was called ouryxquidh. In the same seuse ancient writers use ouyxojízsıy, with its derivatives.5

The air proceeding from the dead body was thought to pollute all things into which it entered ; hence all uncovered vessels which stood in the same room with the corpse were accounted unclean by the Jews. On
this account it was customary to have the whole house purified as soon as the funeral solemnities were over.

Plautus likewise for efferre lias foras ferre :3

The time of burial seems not to have been limited. The author of the
Geniales Dies tells us,4 that bodies were usually kept seventeen days and
seventeen nights before they were interred ; which he seems to have out of Homer, who reports that the body of Achilles was committed to the flames, after seventeen days and as many nights of mourning,5 Servius was of opinion, that the time of burning bodies was the eighth day after death, the time of burying the ninth :6 but this must only be un
derstood of the funerals of great persons, which could not be duly solem
nized without extraordinary preparations: men of inferior rank were com mitted to the ground without so much noise and pomp. The ancient
burials seem to have been upon the third or fourth day after death .? It was not unusual, however, to perform the solemnities, especially of
poor persons, on the day after their decease ; this appears from an epigram of Callimachus :
Δαίμονα τις δ' ού οίδε τον αύριον ; ήνίκα καί σε, Who knows what fortunes on to -morrow wait, Χάρμε , τον οφθαλμοίς χθιζόν εν ημετέροις ,

And on the next was mournfully interred !
Pherecydes alludes to this custom in his epistle to Thales, telling him he expected every minute to breathe his last, and had invited his friends to his funeral the day following.
The ceremony was performed in the day, for night was looked on as a very improper time ; because then Furies and evil spirits,which could not
endure the light, ventured abroad . Hence Cassandra, in a quarrel with
Talthybius, foretels, as one of the greatest mischiefs that could befall him, that it should be his fortune to be buried in the night :9

thought it indecent, and almost impious to reveal it in the face of the sun . Hence, as the expounders of fables tell us, came the stories of youths stolen into Aurora's embraces; for when beauteousand hopeful young men suf fered an untimely death, it was customary to alleviate the disaster by
giving it a more pleasant and agreeable name ; whence, instead of calling their departure death, they term it 'Hrigas egtaryhr. Because these funerals were celebrated by torch - light, it became customary to carry torches at all other burials, though performed in the day ; whence came
that proverbial expression , by which old men are said to approach in the dõda toũ Bíou, to the torch of their life . The Athenians went counter to the rest of the Greeks ; for their laws enjoined them to celebrate their funerals before sunrise: which command Cicero 3 will have to be not more ancient than Demetrius the Phalerean ; but Demosthenes ascribes it to Solon ."
It is not improbable that it might be first instituted by Solon, and after wards revived by Demetrius. The design seems to have been, to moder ate the expensive extravagance of funerals, which a more open and public celebration seemed to require.
The bearers usually mounted the corpse upon their shoulders, which Euripides calls äçony gégsov :5 The servants to the grave the corpse do bear Φέρουσιν άρδην πρός τάφοντε και πυράν.. Upon their shoulders.
The body was sometimes placed upon a bier, instead of which the La cedæmonians commonly used their bucklers ; whence that remarkable command of one of their matrons to her son, Tày, i iri onds, either bring
this (pointing to his buckler) back, or be brought upon it. This custom was not unknown in other places.6
But the most ancient Greeks seem to have conveyed their dead bodies
to their funerals without any vehicle; thus when Patroclus was carried forth by the Myrmidons, Achilles went behind to support his head :7 - όπιθεν δε κάρη έχε διος 'Αχιλλεύς.

The persons present at funerals were the dead man's friends and rela
tions, who thought themselves under an obligation to pay this last respect to their deceased friend. Besides these, others were frequently invited to increase the solemnity, where the laws restrained them not from it ; but in some places, either to prevent the disorders which often happened at such promiscuous meetings, or to diminish the excessive charges of funer als, this was not permitted .

at Mitylene, that none but the relations of the deceased should appear at funerals: Solon also laid some restraint upon his Athenians, wholly ex ..
cluding all women under threescore years of age from these solemnities ;
yet female relations were admitted whilst under that age, as appears from Lysias' oration in defence of Eratosthenes, who had murdered his wife's gallant, whose first acquaintance with her, he tells us, proceeded from see
ing her at a funeral. They seem , however, not to have gone promiscu ously among the men , but in a body by themselves, The habit of these persons was not always the same ; for though they
sometimes put on mourning, and at common funerals as frequently retained
their ordinary apparel; yet the exequies of great men were commonly celebrated with expressions of joy for their reception into heaven . Thus Timoleon's hearse was followed by many thousands of men and women in
white garments, and bedecked with garlands, as in festival solemnities ;? the funeral of Aratus was likewise celebrated with pæans or songs of tri umph and dances.3
When the body was conveyed out of the house, they took their last farewell, saluting it in a certain form of words :4 Do you, since ancient custom so requires, Προσείπατ ' έξιούσαν υστάτην οδόν.. Salute the corpse, and take your last farewell.
The procession was commonly made on horseback or in coaches, but at the funerals of persons to whom a more than ordinary reverence was thought due, all went on foot: this respect the Athenians paid to the me mory of Theophrastus, as an acknowledgment of his excellent virtues.s
The relations went next the corpse , the rest walked at some distance: sometimes the men went before it, with their heads uncovered, the women
following it. Patroclus was carried to his funeral surrounded by the Gre cian soldiers. But the ordinary way was for the body to go first, and the
rest to follow ;" the survivers were thus reminded of their mortality, and
taught to remember that they were all following in the way the dead per son was gone before.8 At the funerals of soldiers, their fellow -soldiers
attended with their spears pointed towards the ground, and the uppermost part of their bucklers turned downwards. This was not done so much, as some fancy , because the gods were carved upon their bucklers, whose faces
would have been polluted by the sight of a dead body, as that they might recede from their common custom ; the method of mourning being to act contrary to what was usual at other times ; and therefore not only their bucklers, but their spears, and the rest of their weapons, were inverted,
Nor was this only a martial custom , but practised likewise in peace ; for at the funerals of magistrates, their ensigns of honourwere inverted . Το perform this ceremony , they termed εκπέμπιν, παραπέμπειν, and #goniuttiv; the first with respect to the house , out of which the body was

CHAP. V.
OF THEIR MOURNING FOR THE DEAD.
The ceremonies by which the Greeks used to express their sorrow uponi the death of friends, and on other occasions, were various and unicer
tain : but it seems to have been a constant rule amongst them to recede as
much as possible, in habit and in all their behaviour, from their ordinary customs; by which change they thought it would appear that some extra ordinary calamity had befallen them. ' Hence , mourners, in some cities, demeaned themselves in the very same manner as persons who in other
places designed to express joy ; for the customsof one city being contrary
to those of another, it sometimes happened that what in one place passed for an expression of mirth, was in others a token of sorrow . The most
ordinary ways of expressing sorrow were these that follow :
1. They abstained from banquets and entertainments, and banished from their houses all musical instruments, and whatever was calculated
to excite pleasure , or bore an air of mirth and gaiety . They frequented no public solemnities, nor appeared in places of con course, but sequestered themselves from company, and refrained even
from the comforts and conveniences of life. Wine was too good a friend to cheerfulness to gain admission into so melancholy a society ; the light
itself was odious, and nothing courted but dark shades and lonesome retirements, which they thought bore some resemblance to their misfor
tunes. Whence Artemidorus lays it down as a certain forerunner of death, for any one to dream of a fire’s being extinguished during the sickness of any in the same family.3
2. They diveșted themselves of all ornaments, and laid aside their jewels, gold, and whatever was rich and precious in their apparel,4
This custom is frequently mentioned in the poets, but was not peculiar to mourners for the dead ; being likewise, with several other ceremonies
mentioned in this chapter, practised by all that lamented any great cala
mity . Whence Hecuba had no sooner heard the fortune assigned to herself and Cassandra, than she cried out,

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE . 575
Their mourning garments were always black .' To this custom Peri cles had respect when he boasted , that he had never given cause to any citizen to put on black.”2 Hence Artemidorus will have it to be a pre
sage of recovery for a sick person to dream of black clothes, since not those that die, but those who survive to mourn are apparelled in black.3
The Egyptians are said to have introduced this custom, when they mourned for the death of Liber, otherwise called Osiris, who was treach
erously circumvented and murdered by his brother Typho . Farther, mourning garments differed from ordinary apparel not only in colour but likewise in value, as being of cheap and coarse stuff.4 3. They tore, cut off, and sometimes shaved their hair ; and it was not sufficient to deprive themselves of a small part only , for we find Electra in Euripides finding fault with Helena for sparing her locks, and thereby defrauding the dead . This custom is too well known to need any confir
mation by examples. They had several ways of disposing of their hair : it was sometimes thrown upon the dead body, as we learn from the fune ral- of Patroclus, where the Greeks, to show their affection and respect to
him, covered his body with their hair . It was likewise customary to cast it into the funeral pile, to be consumed with the body of their friend ; as
Achilles appears to have done at Patroclus's funeral. Sometimes it was laid upon the grave , Canace in Ovid bewails her misfortune, because
she was debarred from performing this ceremony to her beloved Macareus:
Non mihi te licuit lacrymis perfundere justis, Nor weeping could I follow to the grave, In tua non tonsas ferre & pulchra comar. Nor on thy tomb could offer my shorn hair. Thy unoffending life I could not save,
Some confine this practice to sons, or very near relations ; but it appears to have been common to all who thought themselves obliged to express their respect or love to the dead ; insomuch that, upon the death
of great men , the inhabitants of whole cities and countries were commonly shaved ,
The praetice may be accounted for two ways: it was used, partly to render the ghost of the deceased person propitious, which seems to be the reason why they threw hair into the fire to burn with him, or laid it on his body; partly that they might appear disfigured , and careless of their
beauty, for long hair was looked on as very becoming, and the Greeks
prided themselves in it ; hence they are so frequently honoured by Homer with the epithet of καρηκομόωντες..
It may be farther observed , that in solemn and public mournings, it was common to extend this practice to their beasts, that all things might appear as deformed and ugly as might be. Thus Admetus, upon the death of Alcestis, commands his chariot- horses to be shorn :9
Τιριττά τι ζούγνυσθε, και μονάμπυκας My chariot-horses, too , shall share my pain > > it ' ΙΙίλους σιδήρη τίμνετ' αυχένων φόβην. Let them be shorn, and lose their comely tnane.

Thus likewise the Thessalians cut off their own hair and their horses'
manes at the death of Pelopidas ;? when Masistius was slain in a skirmish with the Athenians, the Persians shaved themselves, their horses, and
their mules ;. but Alexander, as in the rest of his actions, so in this
went beyond the rest of mankind ; for at the death of Hephæstion , he not only cut off the manes of his horses and mules, but took down the battle
ments from the city walls, that even towns might seem moumers ; and
instead of their former beauteous appearance, look bald at the funeral.3 It may be objected , indeed, to what I have been stating, that shaving was a sign of joy ; whereas to let their hair grow long was the practice of persons in affiction : hence Joseph is said to have been shaved when he
was delivered out of prison ; and Mephibosheth, during the time king David was banished from Jerusalem , let his hair grow , but on his return shaved himself. Thus likewise mariners, upon their deliverance from shipwreck , used to shave themselves . Whence Artemidorus will have
mariners that dream of having their whole head shaved , to be forewarned
by the gods, that they are to undergo very great hazards, but to escape with life . Pļiny also, in one of his epistles, interprets his dream of cut ting off his hair, to be a token of his deliverance from some imminent
danger ; and the poets furnish us with several examples to our purpose . Lycophron , for instance , thus describes a general lamentation : 6
πάς δε λυγαίαν λεώς “Εσθήτα προστρόπαιον έγχλαινούμενος, Αυχμό πινώδης λυπρόν άμερεύσει βίον " Κρατός δ' άκουρος νώτα καλλυνει φόβη Μνήμην παλαιών τημελούσ ' οδυρμάτων.

Plutarch , undertaking to solve this difficulty, reports that the men let their hair grow , but the women were shaved ; it being the fashion for men to wear their hair short at other times, and for women to suffer
theirs to grow :7 but, on the contrary, it plainly appears from the instances already produced , and many others, that the men frequently wore long hair, which they cut off upon any great calamity ; nor can it be doubted
that the women frequently wore long hair in sorrow , since it is remarked , as a badge of a woman in mourning, that she has her hair dishevelled, and carelessly flowing about.
Wherefore two things may be observed for the solution of this difficulty : first, the manner of being shaved : for though to be shaved or trimmed
by barbers was a token of cheerfulness, yet those that cut off their own hair, and that in a negligent and careless manner, were looked on as mourners : whence, though Artemidorus reports that no man under the
pressure of misfortunes was ever shaved , yet he adds, in the same chap

ter, that for a man to dream of shaving himself was a presage of some
great calamity ; because men in such circumstances were wont to shave themselves . Secondly, the different fashions of several nations are to be considered : for where it was customary to wear short hair, there the length of hair was a token of mourning ; but where long hair was in fashion , there mourners shaved themselves. It is reported by Herodotus'
and others , that the Argians having lost Thyrea to the Spartans, made a
decree, that their whole city should cut their hair, and never permit it to grow again to its accustomed length till they recovered that place. The
Spartans, on the contrary, who used to wear their hair short, put forth a decree that from that time they should nourish their hair, in reproach to their enemies. Now, in these cities, when the fashion was to wear short
hair, then mourners were distinguished by long hair ; but long hair com ing into fashion, mourners were shaved .
4. It was frequent for persons overwhelmed with grief, and unable to bear up under it, to throw themselves upon the earth, and roll in the dust ; and the more dirty the ground was, the better it served to defile
them , and to express their sorrow and dejection.3 5. They covered their heads with ashes. Thus Achilles, upon the news of Patroclus' death :
'Αμφοτέρυσι δε χερσίν ελών κόιν αιθαλόεσσαν, And seizing the burnt ashes with both hands, Χούατο κακκεφαλής.

6. When any occasion required their attendance abroad , their heads were muffled up, as appears from these verses in the epigram :5 - φάρος γαρ επικρεμές αμφί πρόσωπα Her face, wrapt in a veil, declared her woes, Πήματα και δείκνυσιν.---
Whence Orestes, persuading Electra to leave off mourning, bids her be unveiled : --- ανακάλυπτο , ώκασίγνητον κάρα , Pull off your veil, dear sister, and forbear

7. Another token of dejection was , to decline their heads, upon their
hands. Whence Helen speaks thus of the calamitous Trojans:1 'Επί δέ κρασί χείρας έθηκαν. They with their hands support their drooping head.
8. They went softly to express their faintness and loss of strength and
spirits. Thus Ahab, king of Israel, being terrified by the judgment Elias denounced against him , .fasted , and Jay in sackcloth , and went
softly ." And Hezekiah, king of Judah, being told by the prophet that he was never to recover of a distemper he then lay under, amongst other expressions of sorrow hath this : “ I shall go softly all my years, in the bitterness of my soul.” 4.9. They beat their breasts and thighs, and tore their flesh , making furrows in their faces with their nails; these actions, though practised sometimes by men, were more frequent among women, whose passions are more violent and ungovernable.4
Solon thought fit to forbid this amongst other extravagances at funerals. The Lacedæmonians bore the death of their private relations with great constancy and moderation ; but when their king died, they had a barbarous
custom of meeting in vast numbers, where men, women, and slaves, all mixed together, tore the flesh from their foreheads with pins and needles. The design of this was not only to testify their sorrow , but also to gratify
the ghosts of the dead, who were thought to feed upon , and delight in no thing so much as blood.6 10. They accused and cursed their gods.7 Nor was this the effect of
extravagant passion , or practised only by persons of weaker understand
ings in the extremity of their sorrow , but frequently done by men of all qualities, and that in the most grave and solemn manner that could be 3 For the gods being thought subject to human passions, it was very easy for men under misfortunes to impeach them of cruelty or envy . Thus,
when Hylas, the darling of Hercules, perished in the waters, the deities residing there were said to have been enamoured with him, and to have
stolen him : and when any great and public blessing was taken away , the immortal beings were said to envy mankind so great felicity '

580 GRÉCIAN ANTIQUITIES.
motion of the spheres made a divine and eternal harmony : others say ,
they were designed to divert the sorrow of the dead man's surviving relations. The most probable opinion is, that they were intended to
excite sorrow ; and hence the lyra, being consecrated to Apollo, and fit only for pæans and cheerful songs , was never used at such solemnities. Admetus, indeed, commands the flute likewise to be banished out of his city upon the death of Alcestis. But we are only to infer from this
that the ancients had different sorts of flutes, some of which were proper in times of mirth , others in times of mourning ; for it appears by many
examples, that some of their ævioi, or tibiæ , were of all instruments the most common at funerals.?
Some indeed will have the Lydian flutes more suitable to funerals; the
Phrygian , of which Statius speaks, to agree with mirth and cheerfulness , and to be used only at funerals of infants or youths, which were ordinarily solemnized in a manner quite different from those of grown persons, which
they think confirmed by Statius's words : but as these may bear a quite different sense, not the instrument, but the song, of which he there speaks, being proper for the funerals of persons under age ; so it appears farther,
that the most common flutes used at these solemnities were of the Phry gian fashion , though perhaps neither the Lydian nor some others might be wholly excluded : hence nænia, which is the Latin word for funeral
dirges, seems to have been derived from the Greek vnvictoy, which is used by Hipponax ; and (however Scaliger deduces it from the Hebrew )
affirmed by Pollux to be of Phrygian original; vnuupistolas is of the same descent, and expounded by Ignusãy. The Carian flute was likewise used on these occasions, whence the musicians and mourners were termed
Kapvícs,s and Kapixi povod is a funeral song: now this was the very same with that used by the Phrygians, from whom Pollux tells us it was first
conveyed into Caria . I shall only mention two more ; the first is the Mysian flute, an instrument likewise fit for sorrow ; hence Æschylus :5 Και στέρν ' αράσσει , κλπιβοά το Μύσιον.

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 581
antiquity may perhaps admit of a dispute. But it seems probable, that however the låter Greeks were better affected to the way of burning, yet
the custom of the most primitive ages was to inter their dead. It is
plain the Athenians, however afterwards addicted to burning, used inter ment in Cecrops' reign, if any credit may be allowed to Cicero ;' and the
scholiast upon Homera positively affirms, that interring was more ancient than burning, which he reports to have been first introduced by Hercules.
However, it appears that the custom of burning was received in the Tro jan war, and both then and afterwards generally practised by the Greeks: insomuch that when Lucian enumerates the various methods used by dif ferent nations in disposing of their dead , he expressly assigns burning to
Greece , and interment to the Persians. But this is not so to be under
stood , as if the Greeks in the ages he speaks of never interred their dead, or thought it unlawful so to do ; but only that the other custom was
more generally received by them. Socrates, in Plato's Phædon, speaks
expressly of both customs; and it appears that some of them looked on the custom of burning as cruel and inhuman ; whence a poet cited by Eusta thius , introduces a person exclaiming against it, and calling out upon Prometheus to haste to his assistance, and steal, if possible , from mortals,
the fire he had given them. The philosophers were divided in their opinions about it ; those who thought human bodies were compounded of water, earth , or the four elements, inclined to have them committed to
the earth . But Heraclitus, with his followers, imagining fire to be the first principle of all things, aflected burning: for every one thought it the most reasonable method , and most agreeable to nature , so to dispose of bodies, as they might soonest be reduced to their first principles.
Eustathius assigns two reasons why burning came to be of so general use in Greece ;' the first is because bodies were thought to be uucleau
after the soul's departure, and therefore were purified by fire ; whence Euripides speaks of Clytæmnestra: τυρί καθήγνισται δέμας..
The
body
is
purified
by
fire
.
The
second
reason
is
,
that
the
soul
being
separated
from
the
gross
and
ivactive
matter
,
might
be
at
liberty
to
take
its
flight
to
the
heavenly
mansions
.

Wherefore
the
Indian
philosophers
,
out
of
impatience
to
expect
the
time
appointed
by
nature
,
used
to
consume
themselves
in
a
pile
erected
for
that
purpose
,
and
so

their

ment
.
A

example

this

that

into whose stiffen'd limbs
celestial part of man , by separating from it all gross and corruptible mat ter, with the impure qualities which attend it. Thus Scylla, being slain
by Hercules, was raised from the dead and rendered immortal by her father Phorcys :

δομήσατο
,,
Phorcys by quickening flames new life inspir'd, Αέπτυνιν ου τρέμουσαν ουδαίων 9«άν.. And rais'd her high above the fears of death .
The piles on which they burned dead bodies were called Tupai. They seem not to have been erected in any constant form , or to have consisted always of the same materials, these being varied as time, place and other circumstances required .
The body was placed upon the top of the pile, but was rarely burited
without company ; for besides the various animals they threw upon the pile, we seldom find a man of quality consumed without a number of slaves
or captives: besides these, all sorts of precious ointments and perfumes were poured into the flames.? The body was covered with the fat of beasts that it might consume the sooner ; for it was looked on as a singular blessing to be quickly reduced to ashes; wherefore, in funerals where
numbers of bodies were burned on the same pile, they were so disposed , that those of moist constitutions and easy to be inflamed, being propor
tioned to bodies of contrary tempers, should increase the vehemence of the fire : whence for ten men it was the custom to put in one woman ."
Soldiers usually had their arms burned with them.5
It seems likewise to have been the custom for the garments they had
worn in the time of their lives to be thrown into the pile. Some were so solicitous about this, that they gave orders in their last wills to have it
done : and the Athenians were, as in all other religious observances, so in this, the most profuse of all the Greeks; insomuch that some of their law
givers were forced to restrain them, by severe penalties, from defrauding the living by their liberality to the dead. Lycurgus allowed nothing to be buried with bodies but one red garment, or, at the most, a few branches
of olive; and these only when the person had been eminent for virtue and fortitude. Solon allowed three garments and one ox.8 At Chæronea ,
those that were convicted of extravagance at funerals were punished as soft and effeminate by the censors of women.' The pile was lighted by some of the dead person's nearest relations or
friends, who made prayers and vows to the winds to assist the flames, that the body might be quickly reduced to ashes, 10
At the funerals of generals and great officers, the soldiers, with the rest
of the company, marched in solemn procession three times round the pile, to express their respect for the dead .11 This action was called in Greek

accompanied
with
shouts

appears from others to have been made whilst the pile was burning.4 During the time the pile was burning, the dead person's friends stood by it, pouring forth libations of wine, and calling upon the deceased.5
When the pile was burned down, and the flames had ceased ,
they extinguished the remains of the fire with wine, and then they collected the bones and ashes. This last office, it appears, was performed by near relations.
The bones were sometimes washed with wine, and, which

The remains of Patroclus were inclosed in fat.9
It may here be demanded, how the relics of the body were distinguished from those of the beasts and men burned with it? In answer to this in
quiry, omitting those groundless stories of the stone amianthus, and the
Indian hemp, which could not be consumed by fire, I shall produce two instances, from which it appears the method they took to effect this was by placing the body in the middle of the pile, whereas the men and beasts burned with it lay on the sides. Thus Achilles tells the Greeks it would be easy to discover the remains of Patroclus: 10
Πρώτον μεν κατά πυρκαϊην σβήσατ ' αίθοπι οίνω First let us quench the yet remaining flame Πάσαν, όπoσσον έπεσχη πυρός μόνος" αυταρ έπειτα With sable wine ; then as the rites direct) 'Οστέα Πατρόκλοιο Μενουτιάδαο λέγωμεν, The hero's bones with careful view select; Εε διαγιγνώσκοντες , άριφραδέα δε τέτυκται : Apart, and easy to be known, they lie "Εν μίσση γάρ έκειτο πυρή, τοι δ' άλλοι άνευθεν Amidst the heap ; and obvious to the eye 'Εσχατιή καίοντ ’ επιμιξ ίπποι τε και άνδρες. The rest around the margin may be seen Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name, Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men.
The bones of Achilles are said to have been similarly distinguished . 11 [wine, Δή τότε πυρκαϊήν οίνω σβάσαν, οστέα δ' αυτού When the remaining flames they'd quench'd with
Φαίνετ’ άριφρ δέος" επεί ουχ' ετέροισιν όμοια Which were the hero's bones was plainly seen ; *Ην, αλλ ' οία γίγαντος άτειρέος" ουδε μεν άλλα Nor like the rest which fell his sacrifice, Σύν κείνους εμέμικτο επκι βόες , ήδε και ίπποι, But of a larger and gigantic size ; Και παίδες Τρώων μίγδα κταμένοισι και άλλοις Nor could his bones be with the vulgar mix'd

Diogenes the Cynic, being asked in what posture he would be in

The Megarensians commonly put two, three, or four dead bodies into the same sepulchre ; but at Athens, and in other parts of Greece, one sepulchre, much less one coffin or urn, seldom contained more than one body ;' only those that were joined by near relation or affection were usu
ally buried together, it being thought inhuman to disunite those in death,
whom no accidents of life could separate. Many examples of this nature occur in ancient writers; hence Agathias' epigram concerning two bro thers, twins : Εις δύο αδελφούς ώδ ' επέχει τάφος, έν γαρ επέσχον Two brothers lie interr'd within this urn, * Ημαρ και γενεής οι δύο και θανάτου.. Both died together, as together born .
Lovers thought this no small'accession to their happiness ; Thisbe's last request was, that she might be interred with Pyramus :8 Admetus in
Euripides declares his resolution to lie in the same coffin with his wife
Alcestis . Patroclus appearing after death to Achilles, begs of him that he would deposit his bones in the same urn he designed for his own :10 and when Achilles was dead, we find that the Greeks put the ashes of his friend Antilochus into the same urn with his ; but those of Patroclus were
not only deposited in the same vessel, but mingled together.11 Halcy
one's love carried her still farther ; for her husband Ceyx having perished in a tempest at sea, she comforts herself in this, that though his body
could not be found, yet their names should be inscribed upon the same monument, and, as it were, embrace each other.12

CHAP. VII .
OF THEIR SEPULCHRES, MONUMENTS, CENOTAPHIA, &c.
The primitive Greeks were buried in places prepared for that purpose in their own houses.' The Thebans had once a law, that no person should
build a house without providing a repository for his dead. It seems to
have been customary , even in later ages, to bury within their cities ; the most public and frequented places of which seem to have been best stored
with monuments : but this was a favour not ordinarily granted, except to men of great worth, and public benefactors ; to such as had raised them
selves above the common level, and were examples of virtue to succeeding ages, or had deserved, by some eminent service, to have their memories
'honoured by posterity. The Magnesians raised a sepulchre for Themisto
cles in the midst of their forum ;2 Euphron had the same honour at Co rinth ;9 and it appears to have been common for colonies to bury, in the
midst of their cities, the remains of the leaders under whose conduct they had possessed themselves of new habitations.*
Temples were sometimes made repositories for the dead ; of this the primitive ages afford us so many instances, that some have been of opinion that the honours paid to the dead were the first cause of erecting temples . Nor were later times wholly void of such examples, for the Platæans are said to have buried Euclides in the temple of Diana Euclea , for his pious labour in going a thousand stadia in one day to fetch some of the hallowed fire from Delphi :6 from which, with many other instances, it appears that
this was looked on as a very great favour, and granted as a reward for public services. Sometimes it was desired for protection, as we learn
from Medea's case , who interred her two sons in Juno Acræa's temple, to secure them from the malice of her enemies .?
But the general custom , in later ages especially, was to bury the dead without their cities, and chiefly by the highways. This seems to have
been done, either to preserve themselves from the noisome smells where with graves might infect their cities, or to prevent the danger to which their houses were exposed when funeral piles were set on fire ; or it may be, to fill the minds of travellers with the thoughts of mortality, or to ex cite themselves to encounter any dangers, rather than permit an enemy
to approach their walls, and despoil the monuments, or disturb the peace of the dead . Others think it most probable that this custom was first in troduced by a fear of contracting pollution from the dead.
But Lycurgus, as in most of his institutions, so in this too, differed

from the rest of the Grecian lawgivers ; for, to cut off the superstition of burying- places, he allowed his Lacedæmonians to bury their dead within
the city, and even round about their temples, that their youth , by being used to such spectacles, might not be afraid to see a dead body : and withal, to rid them of the conceit, that to touch a corpse, or tread upon a grave,
would defile a man .
Every family was wont to have its proper burying -place ; to be deprived of which was reputed one of the greatest calamities that could happen ; hence, when the Lacedæmonians were resolved to conquer the Messenians, or to lose their lives in the attempt, we read that they bound tickets to their right arms, containing their own and their fathers' names ; that if
all should perish in the battle , and their bodies be so mangled that they
could not be distinguished, those notes might certify to what family they belonged , that so they might be carried to the sepulchres of their ances
tors. The rest of the Greeks had the same custom ; whence ( to trouble
you with only one instance more) there being a law, that such as preserved not their inheritance should be deprived of the sepulchre of their fathers,
Democritus, having spent his estate in the study of philosophy, was in danger of incurring that penalty.3 The common graves of primitive Greece were nothing but caverns dug in the earth ,4 and called ' cóyou, but those of later ages were more curi ously wrought; they were commonly paved with stone, had arches built over them , and were adorned with no less art and care than the houses of
the living, insomuch that mourners commonly retired into the vaults of
the dead , and there lamented over their departed relations for many days and nights together.5 Kings and great men were anciently buried in mountains, or at the foot, of them.6
Whence appears to have originated the custom of raising a mount upon the graves of great persons :7
Et regim cineres extructo monte quiescunt,
This consisted sometimes of stone ; whence Theseus in Euripides tells Hercules the Athenians would honour his corpse :
λαΐνοισί τ' εξογκώμασι . With high -built monuments of stone.
But the common materials were nothing but earth ; whence it is usually called χώμα.8 To cast it up, Homer calls χέειν σημα , 9 Antipater terms
it χώννυσθαι τάφον" It is sometimes expressed by the more general names of oyxwood, , &c.
Thus

stone were polished and adorned with greater art: whence there is so fre quent mention of ξεστοί τάφοι.3 The ornaments with which sepulchres were beautified were numerous. Pillars of stone were very ancient, as appears from the story of Idas'

The pillars were termed orññas, and frequently contained inscriptions declaring the family, virtues, and whatever was remarkable in the de ceased ; which were commonly described in verse . The Sicyonians had no such inscriptions.7 Lycurgus also would by no means allow of talka
tive grave -stones, nor suffer so much as the names to be inscribed, except of such men as had died in the wars, or of women who had died in child
bed.8 Nor was it unusual at other places to omit the names of the deceased , writing instead of them some moral aphorism , or short exhorta
tion to the living, such as this : ΤΟΥΣ ΑΓΑΘΟΥΣ ΚΑΙ ΘΑΝΟΝΤΑΣ EYERFETEIN ΔΕΙ. The virtuous even when dead ought to be respected .
Besides this, especially when there was no inscription, they commonly
added the dead man's effigies, or some other resemblance pertinent to the

a custom the young men had of carrying water to the sepulchres of un married maids. A careful housekeeper was represented by such figures
as are mentioned in the following epigram of Antipater upon Lysidice: AIaστεύω τίς σου, τίς επί σταλήτιδι πάτρα, What mean these curious figures round thy tomb ?

My peaceful temper next the muzzle shows, What is the meaning of this imagery ? That I no scold or busy tattler was.'
Diogenes the Cynic had a dog engraven upon his monument, to denote the temper of his sect, or his own. The tomb of Isocrates was
adorned with the image of a syren ; that of Archimedes with a sphere and cylinder : by which were signified the charming eloquence of the former, and the mathematical studies of the latter. Nor was it unusual to fix upon graves the instruments which the deceased had used. The
graves of soldiers were distinguished by their weapons ; those of mariners by their oars ; and, in short, the tools of every art and profession accom panied their masters, and remained as monuments to preserve their memory. Hence Elpenor is introduced by Homera begging of Ulysses to
fix upon his tomb the oar with which he used to row.3 Æneas in Virgil performs the like office to his trumpeter Misenus.
These, with many other ceremonies, were designed to perpetuate the
memory of the deceased ; and hence their graves were termed ohjata, penusid , peváheTL, &c. Agamemnon reckons it a great happiness to Achilles that he was honoured with a monument which would transmit his name to posterity .
But later ages grew so extravagant in these structures, that their law
givers were forced to keep them within bounds, by inflicting severe pen alties upon such as exceeded their prescriptions. Solon , in particular,
ordered that no statues of Mercury ( as had been customary, because Mercury was an infernal god ), or arched roofs, should be made in the Athenian monuments, and that the monuments should never be greater
than ten men were able to erect in three days; and Demetrius the Phalerean enacted a law , that not more than one pillar, and that not
exceeding three cubits in height, should be placed upon any monu ment, 6
It may not be improper to mention their custom of praying for their friends, and for men of piety and virtue, that the earth might lie light upon them ; for their enemies, and all wicked men, that it might press heavy upon them ; for they thought the ghosts that still haunted their shrouds,

Of these there were two sorts: one was erected to such persons. as had been honoured with funeral rites in another place ; of which we find fre quent mention in Pausanias, who speaks of such honorary tombs dedicated
to Euripides, Aristomenes, Achilles, Dameon, Tiresias, &c. The second sort was erected for those that had never obtained a proper
funeral; for the ancients were possessed with an opinion that the ghosts
of men unburied could have no admittance into the blessed regions, but were forced to wander in misery one hundred years ; and that when 'any
man had perished in the sea, or in any other place where his corpse could not be found, the only method of giving him repose was to erect a sepul
chre, and by repeating three times, with a loud voice, the name of the deceased , call his ghost to the habitation prepared for it ; which action was termed ψυχαγωγία ..
This practice seems to have been very ancient: Pelias is introduced in
Pindar ,” telling Jason he must recall the soul . of Phryxus, who died in
Colchis, into his native country. Æneas in Virgil performs the same office to Deiphobus :8 Ausonius has elegantly described , and assigned the reason of this custom :9
Hoc satis et tumulis, satis et telluris egenis; Small is the privilege the unburied crave, Voce ciere animasfuneris instar habet: No grave or decent burial they have ;

In the age before, we find the funeral of Edipus solemnized with sports,
and Hercules is said to have celebrated games at the death of Pelops. The first on whom this honour was conferred was Azan , the son of Arcas,
the father of the Arcadians, whose funeral 4 was celebrated with horse The prizes were of different sorts and value, according to the qua
lity and munificence of the person that celebrated them . The garlands given to victors were usually of parsley, which was thought to have some particular relation to the dead , as being feigned to spring from the blood
of Archemorus; whence it became the crown of conquerors in the Ne mean games, which were first instituted at his funeral.5
It was a general opinion that dead bodies polluted all things about them : this gave rise to the custom of purifying after funerals, which Virgil has thus described :6 Idem ter socios pura circumtulit undn,

The bones selected in a brazen case : Lustravitque viros. A verdant branch of olive in his hands, He mov'd around and purified the bands.
Several other modes of purification may be met with, but they contain nothing peculiar to funerals, and have been already described . Till this
purification was accomplished, the polluted person could not enter the temples, nor bear a part in the worship of the gods :? « Ητες , βροτών μεν ήν τις άψηται φόνου,

Nor was it Diana alone, of whom the poet speaks, that had such an aversion to these pollutions, but the rest of the gods and goddesses were of the same temper. Lucian , in his treatise concerning the Syrian goddess , tells us that when any person had seen a corpse, he was not admitted into her temple till the day following, and not then, unless he had first puri fied himself; and the general prevalence of this custom 8 shows that the
rest of the celestial beings were equally afraid of defilement. This may farther appear from its being unlawful for those persons to enter the tem
ples, who were called irrigótotjos, or devtegóroTfOs, such as were thought dead , but who, after the performance of their funeral rites, recovered ; or such as were reported to be dead in some foreign country, and unexpected
ly returned : these men were prohibited from worshipping any of the gods. Hesychius mentions only the Eumenides, but others speak of the gods in

Delphian oracle what method he should use to be freed from pollution, where he received this answer :
« Οσσα μεν εν λεχέεσσι , γυνή τίκτουσα τελείται , All forms and customs which childbirth attend, Τόσσα μεν άν τελίσαντα θύειν μακάρεσσι θεοίσι. The same must you to the angry gods comniendo
Upon which he was washed , swaddled , and treated in all other respects as Dewborn infants, and then received into communion : but 2 others make
this custom more ancient than Aristinus, carrying it up as high as the
primitive ages. : And it is certain the opinion that dead bodies polluted all things about them was very ancient, as appears from the Jewish laws.

superstitious follies, and to think it unreasonable to fancy that such as lived a virtuous life, and conformably to their discipline, should contract any pollution from death ; on the contrary , they esteemed their remains worthy of respect and honour, and therefore thought no places so fit to contain them as those adjoining to the temples of their gods.3 After the funeral was over, the company met together at the house of the deceased person's nearest relations, to divert them from sorrow ; here
there was an entertainment provided ,4 which was termed rsgidsutvov, vex góðumrov, rápos ; in Latin, circumpotatio, according to Cicero, who iu forms us that the Attic laws prohibited the use of this ceremony at the funerals of slaves. The custom was very ancient ; the Trojans, having
celebrated Hector's funeral, were splendidly entertained at king Priam's palace :6

though perhaps containing a more mystical sense, was an undoubted allu sion , Tà recórru pen anaiptioboly take not up things fallen down ; or, as others express it , Μηδέ γεύεσθαι άτα ' αν εντός τραπέζης καταπίση , do not so much as taste things fallen under the table. These fragments were
carried to the tomb, and there left for the ghost to feast upon ; whence, to
denote extreme poverty, it was usual to say, that a person stole his meat from the graves .
The entertainments of later ages consisted not, like those in Homer, of
flesh only, but of all sorts of pulse,3 beans, pease, with lettuces, parsley, eggs, and many other things. The chief subjects of discourse at these
meetings were the praises of the dead, especially if they had been eminent for any virtue or commendable quality ; otherwise, so great was the sim plicity of primitive ages, that they looked upon it as most expedient to say
nothing, when by speaking they must unavoidably offend the dead man , or transgress the rules of truth , both which were thought equally criminal; afterwards, however, they grew more lavish of their commendations, be stowing them on all without distinction ; hence came the proverb, Our
iparvedsins oud iv tepidshaww , you would not be praised even at a funeral entertainment, which was only applied to the greatest villains, and such as had not the least shadow of a good quality to recommend them . There was a custom at Argos, which obliged those who had lost any of their kindred or acquaintance, to sacrifice to Apollo presently after mourning, and thirty days after to Mercury, from an opinion , that as the earth received their bodies, so their souls fell into the hands of Mercury .
The barley of the sacrifice they gave to the priest of Apollo, the flesh they took themselves ; and having extinguished the sacrificial fire, which they accounted polluted, they kindled another on which they boiled the flesh , calling it iyxviouce , from the fumes ascending from the burnt sacrifice, which were termed κνίσσα ,.
The honours paid to the sepulchres and memories of the deceased were of various sorts ; it was customary to place lamps 5 in the subterraneous

vaults of the dead, to which such as would express an extraordinary affec tion for their relations retired, and cloistered themselves up." They had a custom of bedecking tombs with herbs and flowers, amongst
which parsley was chiefly in use ; hence it was that when Timoleon,
marching up an ascent, from the top of which he might take a view of the army and strength of the Carthaginians, was met by a company of
mules loaded with parsley ; his soldiers conceived it to be a very ill-boding and fatal occurrence, that being the very herb with which we adorn the sepulchres of the dead . Hence also the despairing proverb applied to one
dangerously sick, dicha osnívou, that he has need of nothing but parsley ; which is in effect to say, he is a dead man, and ready for the grave. All
sorts of purple and white flowers were acceptable to the dead, as the amaranthus, which was first used by the Thessalians in adorning the
grave of Achilles ;? xólos asuxos,3 which some will have to be the jessa mine, with lilies, and several others. The rose too was very grateful.5 T66ε και νεκροίς αμύνει. , A pleasing fragrance o'er the dead.

In short, graves were bedecked with garlands of all sorts of flowers :1 περιστεφή κύκλο Wherein he lies inurn'd, with wreaths of flowers, Πάντων όσ ' έστιν ανθέων θήκην πατρός. Glowing in all their various dyes, hung round . the sepulchre, POTTER .
These were commonly called { pw Tes ; either from their design to express love and respect to the deceased person , or from iparos, because they were usually composed of a collection of several sorts of flowers ; or
from šga, as being laid upon the earth ; though neither of these last rea sons are constant; for the garlands were some
times composed of only one sort of flowers, and were frequently hung upon the pillars, and not laid upon the grave -stone.
Several

To these practices we find another added, viz. running naked around

GREECE

597 was
Sacrifices
and
libations
were
also
offered
to
the
dead
:
the
victims
were
black
and
barren
heifers
,
or
black
sheep
,
as
being
of
the
same
sort
with
those
offered
to
the
infernal
gods
,
to
denote
the
contrariety
of
those
re
gions
to
light
and
fruitfulness
.
These sacrifices were offered in ditches; the first thing they offered
was the hair upon the victim's forehead, which , for that reason
termed étagaui, and to offer it árégzsoler: but though these terms are sometimes used for the sacrifices of the ghosts, yet the custom of offering these first- fruits was common to the sacrifices of the celestial and other deities, as appears from several instances. Homer mentions it at one of
Minerva's sacrifices ;2 and in another place speaks of it as acceptable to
the gods.4
But their ordinary offerings were nothing but libations of blood , honey, wine, milk , water, &c.4 Solon forbade the Athenians švey's Boữv, to
offer an ox on this occasion.5: Upon the sacrifice they commonly sprin kled barley-flour. Honey was rarely omitted, being accounted Javérov rújborov, a symbol, or emblem of death . Hence, as some think, the
ghosts of the deceased came to be termed μέλισσαι, the internal gods μειλ ίχιοι, and their oblations μελίγματα.
These oblations were designed to render the ghosts kind and propitious,
and were therefore termed χοαι ηδυντήριοι, or θελκτήριοι. Iphigenia in Euripides thus describes them : 8

The water thus employed was termed λουτρών,, χθόνιον λουτρόν, and at Athens , άπόνιμμα. When persons died who had been married , it was cus
tomary for women to carry water to their graves,
who from pouring it forth were termed lyxu- . ogíorgian. When a young man or maid died, the
water was carried by a boy ,3 or, which appears to some more probable, by a boy to the sepul chres of young men, by a maid to the sepulchres
of maids ; whence came the custom of erecting images, representing maids with vessels of
water upon the sepulchres of such as died in their virginity. Those that died in their in fancy were honoured with no libations, and had no right to the rest of the funeral solemni
ties.5
These honours were paid to the dead on the ninth and thirtieth days
after burial, and were repeated when any of their friends arrived that had been absent at the solemnity, and upon all other occasions which required their surviving relations to have them in memory ; but some part of the month Anthesterion seems to have been especially set apart
for these ceremonies in se zeral of the Grecian cities. The Apolloniatæ ,7 for example, paid the dead the customary honours in this month ;8 and the same custom was observed at Athens, where the days appointed for those solemnities were termed μιαραι ημέραι, and by. others αποφράδες,
as being polluted by their dedication to the dead, whose ghosts were thought to ascend from their subterraneous habitations to enjoy the kind entertainment of their friends ;10 the want of which was thought a great
calamity , and therefore it is reckoned by Cassandra among the manifold misfortunes of the Trojans, that they should have no surviving friends to offer sacrifices at their tombs : ουδέ πρός τάφους

To return : they had anniversary days, on which they paid their devo tions to the dead : these were sometimes termed Népsora, as being cele
brated upon the festival of Nemesis, who was thought to have especial
care for the bonours of the dead ;- sometimes 'Ngaña ,3 as also revéocce4 the reason of which seems to be, that it signifies the anniversary day of a man's nativity, which after his death was solemnized with the same cere
monies that were used upon the anniversary of his death , which were properly termed Nextora ; hence it is, that these two words are commonly
thought to signify the same solemnity.
The
honours
of

These and the other honours of the dead were thought most acceptable when offered by their nearest friends; when by their enemies they were
rejected with indignation. For men were thought to retain the same af fections after death which they had entertained when alive. This appears
from the story of Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of Edipus, who, hav
ing killed each other in single combat, and being burned on the same pile, the flames of their bodies would not unite, but, by keeping apart from each other, demonstrated the irreconcilable and immortal hatred of the brothers.8
Lycophron has furnished us with the parallel example of Mopsus and
Amphilochus, who, having slain each other, were buried in the opposite sides of a hill, lest their ghosts should be disturbed by having their sepul chres within sight one another.9

CHAP. IX.
OF THEIR LOVE OF BOYS .
Who it was that first introduced the custom of loving boys into Greece is uncertain : however ( to omit the infamous amours of Jupiter, Orpheus,
Laius of Thebes, and others), we find it generally practised by the ancient Greeks, and that not only in private, but by the public allowance and
encouragement of their laws; for they thought there could be no means more effectual to excite their youth to noble undertakings, nor any greater
security to their commonwealths, than this generous passion. This the
invaders of their liberties so often experienced , that it became a received maxim in the politics of tyrants, to use all their endeavours to extirpate
it out of their dominions ;' on the contrary, free commonwealths, and all those states that consulted the advancement of their own honour, seem to
have been unanimous in establishing laws to encourage and reward it.
The practice was so generally adopted, and so highly esteemed in Crete, that such of their well-born and beautiful youths as never had any
lovers, incurred the public censure , as persons some way or other faulty in their morals ; as if nothing else could hinder, but that some one's af
fections would be placed upon them : but those that were more happy in being admired, were honoured with the first seats at public exercises, and wore, for a distinguishing badge of honour, a sort of garment richly
adorned ; this they still retained after they arrived to man's estate , in memory that they had once been xduvoi, eminent,2 which was the name
the Cretans gave to youths who had lovers. The lovers themselves were
called piantages. One thing was remarkable in this place, that the lovers always took their boys by force ; for having placed their affections upon any one, they gave notice of it to his relations, and informed them on
what day they designed to take him : if the lover was unworthy of the boy they refused to yield him up ; but if his quality and virtues were answerable they made some slight opposition, to satisfy the law , and pursued him to his lodgings, but then gave their consent. After this, the lover carried
the boy whither he pleased, the persons that were present at the rape bearing him company. He entertained him some time, two months at the farthest, with hunting, and such diversions, and then returned him
home. At his departure, it was ordered by law that the boy should receive a suit of armour, an ox , and a cup , to which the lover usually
added out of his own bounty several other presents of value. The boy on his return home sacrificed the ox to Jupiter, made an entertainment for
those who had accompanied him in his flight, and gave an account of the usage he had experienced from his lover ; for in case he was rudely

Ereated, the law allowed him satisfaction . During all the time of their
converse together, nothing unseemly, nothing repugnant to the ancient laws of virtue, passed between them ;2 and however some authors are
inclined to have hard thoughts of this custom , yet the testimonies of many others, with the high characters given by the ancients of the old
Cretan constitutions, by which it was approved , are sufficient to vindi
cate it from all false imputations. The same is put beyond dispute by what Strabo tells us, 3 that was not so much the external beauty of a
boy, as his virtuous disposition , his modesty , and courage, which recom mended him.
From the Cretans pass we to the Lacedæmonians, several of whose constitutions were derived from Crete . Their love of boys was remark able all over Greece, and for the whole conduct and excellent consequences of it everywhere admired ; for it was generous, and worthy of the Spartan education ; it was first entertained from a mutual esteem of one another's
virtue ; and the same cause which first inspired the flame alone served to nourish and continue it ; it was not tainted with so much as a suspicion of immodesty. Agesilaus is said to have refused so much as to kiss the boy
he loved,4 for fear of eensure ; and if a person attempted any thing but what was consistent with the strictest rules of modesty, the laws, however encouraging a virtuous love, condemned him to disgrace ,5 by which he
was deprived of almost all the privileges of free denizens. The same practice was allowed the women toward their own sex, and was so much
in fashion among them , that the most steady and virtuous matrons would publicly own their passion for a modest and beautiful virgin ;6 which is a
farther confirmation of the innocency of this custom . Maximus, the Ty rian ,7 assures us the Spartans loved their boys no otherwise than a man may be enamoured with a beautiful statue, and he proves this from the
fact, that though several men's fancies met in one person , yet did not that cause any strangeness or jealousy among them, but was rather the beginning of a very intimate friendship ; whilst they all jointly conspired to render the beloved boy the most accomplished in the world ; for the ob
ject of this love was, that the young men might be improved in all virtu ous and commendable qualities, by conversing with men of probity and
experience ; and hence the lover and the beloved shared the honour and
disgrace of each other ; the lover especially was blamed if the boy offended, and suffered what punishment was due to his fault;' thus we read of one who was fined by the magistrates, because the lad whom he loved cried
out effeminately whilst he was fighting. The same love continued when the boy had attained to manhood ; he still preserved his former intimacy with his lover, imparted to him all his designs, and was directed by his counsels, as appears from the history of Cleomenes, who, before his ad

vancement to the kingdom , was beloved by one Xenares, with whom he ever after maintained a most intimate friendship, till he went about his project of new -modelling the commonwealth , which Xenares not approv ing, departed from him, but still remained faithful to him, and concealed his designs. If we pass from Sparta to Athens, we shall find that there Solon forbade
slaves to love boys, making that an honourable action , and, as it were , inviting 2 the worthy to practise what he commanded the unworthy to forbear3 That lawgiver himself is said to have loved Pisistratus,4 and the most eminent men in that commonwealth submitted to the same pas
sion . Socrates, who died a martyr for disowning the pagan idolatry, is very remarkable for such amours, yet seems not, whilst alive, to have in
curred the least suspicion of dishonourable conduct ; for what else could be the cause , that when Callias, Thrasymachus, Aristophanes, Anytus, and Melitus, with the rest of his enemies, accused him of teaching Critias to
tyrannize, and of sophistry, contempt of the gods, and other crimes, they never so much as upbraided him with impure love, or for writing or dis
coursing upon that subject ? And though some persons, especially in later ages, and perhaps unacquainted with the practice of the ancient Greeks,
have called in question that philosopher's virtue in this point, yet both he and his scholar Plato are sufficiently vindicated from that imputation by
Maximus'the Tyrian, to whom I refer the reader. The innocency of this love may farther appear from their severe laws enacted against im

modest love, by which the youths that entertained such lovers were de
clared infamous, and rendered incapable of public employments, and the persons that prostituted them condemned to die. Several other penalties were likewise ordered , to deter all men from so heinous and detestable a crime.1 The Theban lawgivers encouraged this excellent passion, to temper
the manners of their youth ; nor were they disappointed of their expecta
tion, a pregnant evidence of which we have in the ispà pánay's, sacred band ; it was a party of 300 chosen men, composed of lovers and their beloved, and therefore called sacred ; it gained many important victories, was the
first that ever overcame the Spartans, whose courage till then seemed ir resistible, upon equal terms, and was never beaten till the battle at Chæ
rónea ; after which king Philip, taking a view of the slain , and coming to the place where these 300, who had fought his whole phalanx, lay dead together, was struck with wonder ; and understanding that it was the band of lovers, said , weeping, let them perish who suspect that these men either
did or suffered any thing base.
The lover was called by the Spartans είσπνιλος , είσπνηλος , or, as others write it, εισπνήλης : the beloved was termed by the Thessalians αΐτης - 3
Both the names are derived παρά το τον ερώμειον εισαΐειν και εισπνείν τον ipwta tū kyatūvto, from the lover's being inspired with affection by his beloved .

in love with deciding causes, he says that upon every place he writ xnu's xados, which word signifies the cover of the judiciary urn .
Lovers usually decked the doors of their beloved with flowers and gar lands; for , thinking that the persons on whom their affections were placed , were the very image of the deity of love, their house could be no less
than Cupid's temple, which was accustomed to receive those honours. From the same origin , they seem to have derived that other custom of making libations before their mistress' doors, and of sprinkling them with
wine, of which we have mention in the scholiast upon Aristophanes,3 where
he reports that many of the Thessalian gentlemen were in love with the beautiful Naïs, and publicly owned their passion by sprinkling the doors of her house with wine.
When a person's garland was untied , it was taken for a sign of being in
love ;4 and for a woman to compose a garland was another indication of her passion :
Εάν τις πλίκη The wreathing garlands in a woman is Γήνη στέφανον , εράν δοκεί . The usual symptom of a love - sick mind.
They had several methods of discovering whether their love would prove successful: that of the cótraßos, which was very common at entertain
ments, is hereafter described . Two other ways mentioned by Theocritus, I have already described in one of the preceding books, 7 When their love was without success , they had recourse to several arts
to procure the affections of their beloved. The Thessalian women were famous for their skill in this, as well as other magical practices. The
means by which it was effected were of various sorts : it was sometimes
done by potions called piatga, which are frequently mentioned in authors of both languages .
Their operations were violent and dangerous, and commonly deprived such as drank them of their reason , Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos report,
that Lucullus, the Roman general, first lost his reason , and afterwards his life, by one of them. Lucretius the poet ended his life the same way ; and
Caius Caligula was driven into a fit of madness by a philtre given him by his wife Czesonia.9
'Ovid likewise assures us that this was the usual effect of these potions: Nec data profuerint pallentia philtra puellis, Ne'er move the scornful maids' relentless hearts, · Philtra nocent animis, vimquefuroris habent. They but distract the senses, seize the brain , All poisonous drugs and necromantic arts And Venus' rights and mysteries profane,
The ingredients of which they were composed were of several sorts. Several of the most remarkable were these that follow :
Hippomanes, a piece of flesh upon the forehead of colts newly foaled, of a black or brown colour, in bigness and shape like a fig; which the mares
bite off as soon as they have foaled ; but if they be prevented, forsake their offspring ; whence it was thought a prevalent medicine to conciliate love,

Lol on the mountain brow the mares inhale
especially when reduced to powder, and swallowed with somedrops of the
lover's blood . It is frequently mentioned by the writers of natural his-> tory. Aristotle, Pliny, Solinus, Columella , with many others, have
thought it worth their notice . The poets are full of its effects ; whence Dido, to omit other instances, has recourse to it, when pretending to re call Æneas to her affection , 1
The same word is frequently taken in another sense, and is described
by Pliny to be virus distillans ab inguine equæ coitum maris appetentis, et in furorem agens. This was no less powerful than the former, as ap
pears from Pausanias' story of a horse's statue, dedicated by one Phormis, an Arcadian , which being infected by a magician with the hippomanes I

Virgil will have it to proceed from Lusitanian mares impregnated by the wiod : 4

"lüyf is the name of a small bird, the Latin of which is not agreed on ; some translate it passerculus, others will have it the same with torquilla, frutilla , or with regulus. This bird the writers of fables tell us,6 was the
daughter of Pan and Pitho, or Echo, and having inveigled Jupiter into the love of Io, was transformed by Juno ; upon this she became the dar
ling of Venus, and retaining the same inclinations she formerly had, still served to promote the affairs of love : the first time the goddess made use of her was in the Argonautic expedition, when she invented love-magic,
with charms and potions ( a chief ingredient whereof was this bird), which she communicated to Jason , to gain his access to Medea's affections.?
The part most valued by enchanters was the tongue, which they looked
on as having a sovereign virtue in love potions : sometimes they fastened the whole bird to a wheel of wax , which they turned over the fire till both
were consumed , thus inflaming the party in whom they had a mind to create love. Others will have türš to signify nothing but a musical in strument ; and some take it for all sorts of allurements .

To these may be added several herbs ; insects bred out of putrid mat

to generate love, whereas those on the right side caused hatred. Others took the same 'bones, when the flesh was devoured by ants, and cast them into a vessel of water, wherein those that sunk , being wound up in
a white linen cloth, and hung about any person , inflamed him with love, the others with hatred . The entrails of the toad were also used in poi

Other ingredients were rags, torches, and, in short, all relics, and whatever had any relation to corpses, or funerals. Sometimes a nest of young swallows was placed in a convenient vessel, and buried in the earth
till they were famished : then they opened the grave , and such of them as
were found with mouths shut, were thought conducive to allay the passion of love ; but the rest, which perished with mouths gaping for food, were
thought to excite it. To the same end they used bones snatched from hungry and ravenous bitches, which were believed to infuse some part of
the eager desire of those animals into the potion .
To these they added another ingredient more powerful than any of the rest :4
Abacta nulla Veia conscientia, &c. O'er dainties, chang'd twice, thrice a -day, Veia, who never knew remorse , Slowly to gaze his life away ; Uplifts the spade with feeble force ; That the foul hags, an amorous dose And breathless with the hellish toil,

it, barley -bran , which , either by itself, or made up in paste, they cast into the fire, hoping thereby to inspire the flames of love.
Sometimes they used @apita , flour, which the scholiast upon Theocri tus will have termed θυλήματα • 22 Instead of bran or flour, it was usual to burn laurel.3
It was likewise customary to melt wax , thereby to mollify the person's heart whom they desired . Sometimes they placed clay before the fire, together with wax, that as
one melted whilst the other hardened , so the person that then rejected them might have his heart softened with affection, and inflamed with de.. sire, whilst their own became hard and unrelenting ; or that his heart .
might be rendered incapable of any impression from other beauties, but easy of access to themselves. This seems to be Virgil's meaning in the first of the following verses ; the latter two contain some of the customs already described out of Theocritus :5
Limus ut hic durescit, et hæc ut cera liquescit, Such let the soul of cruel Daphtis be, Uno endemque igni; sic nosiro Daphnis amore : Hard to the rest of women , soft to me. Sparge molam , et fragiles incende bitumine luuros ; Crumble the sacred mole of salt and corn , Daphnis me malus urit, ego hanc in Daphnide lau- Next in the fire the bays with brimstone burn,

It was customary to imitate all those actions which they had a mind that the person whom they loved should perform . They turned a wheel
round, praying he might fall down before their doors, and roll himself on the ground :6
Χώς δινειθ', 8δε ρόμβος ο χαλκεός, εξ 'Αφροδίτας And, Venus, as I whirl this brazen wheel, Ως κείνος οινοιτο ποθ' άμετέροισι θύραισιν. Before my doors let perjur'd Delphis reel,
We are told that it has been usual to compose an image of wax, and
calling it by the name of the person to be inflamed with love, to place it near the fire, the heat of which affected the image, and the person repre
sented by it, at the same time.7 Virgil's enchantress speaks of drawing it three times round the altar :8 terque hæc altaria circum

the threshold ; this was done for the purpose of retaining the lover, and securing his affections from wandering. Another method consisted in throwing the ashes of the various sub
stances that had been burned during the incantation , backwards, over the head, into a running stream , without venturing to look behind.2
I shall only trouble you with one expedient more , which was their tying three love -knots to unite the beloved person's affections with their own.3
It is deserving of remark, that most of their actions in these rites were confined to the number three , 'Ες τρίς αποσπίνδω , και τρις τάδε, πότνια, φωνώ.4 Thrice, thrice I pour, and thrice repeat my charma.
because the gods were thought to take pleasure in that number : - numero deus impare gaudet.

Many of their other practices were the same with those used at common incantations: the charm , or form of verses, had little difference besides
the proper application to the present occasion : Virgil's nymph speaks of her verses as of the same sort, and endued with the same efficacy as Circe's.s And the herbs and minerals used in other magical operations, were no
less sought for in this, there being in them, as it was thought, some won derful powers, which were equally prevalent in all supernatural and mi raculous effects : hence we find Virgil's nymph alluring Daphnis to her love by the very same medicaments which Moeris had found effectual in
performing other magical feats.9 The gods likewise were the same that superintended all magical arts. 10 Thus far concerning their arts in exciting love. It may be inquired, in the next place, whether they had any means to allay the passion when once raised ? Now it appears , that it was common to set the patient at

liberty by the help of more powerful medicaments, or demons superior to those that had bound him . But love, inspired without the assistance of magic, scarce yielded to any cure. Apollo himself could find no remedy against it :
Hei mihi ! quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis, To cure the pains of love no plant avails, Nec prosunt domino, quæ prosunt omnibus, artes. And his own physic the physician fails. Alas ! that fields and forests can afford No remedies to heal their love-sick lord !
No art, according to Ovid, was ever able to set a lover at liberty : 3 Nulla fecantatas deponent pectora cures, Altars may smoke with expiatory fire, Necfugiet vivo sulphure victus amor, Too weak to make a well- fix'd love retire ; Not all the power of verse with magic join'd Love by repulse still works the passion higher. Can heal the torture of a love-sick mind ;
But, notwithstanding the difficulty of this cure, there are not wanting various prescriptions adapted to the several causes and occasions of the malady.4
The antidotes may be reduced to two sorts : they were either such as had some natural virtue to produce the designed effect ; as agnus castus,
and all the herbs reputed enemies to generation :5 or such as wrought the cure by some occult and mystical power, and the assistance of demons; as the sprinkling of the dust in which a mule had rolled herself , the tying of toads in the hide of a beast lately slain , and all the minerals and herbs, which were looked on as amulets against other effects of magic, for those were likewise proper on such occasions : hence the poets, usually mention Caucasus, Colchis, and other places famous for magical plants, as those which alone could furnish remedies and antidotes against love.8
The infernal gods were called upon for assistance.9
Lastly, to mention no more expedients, they cured themselves of love by washing in the water of Selemnus, a river that falls into the sea near Argyra in Achaia. Selemnus, a beautiful young shepherd in those parts,
was beloved by Argyra, the nymph from whom the town and fountain of
that name were called ; but the flower of his age being over, the nymph deserted him, upon which he pined away , and was transformed into a river by Venus; after this he still retained his former passion , and, as the Patrensians report, for some time conveyed his waters through a subter
raneous passage to the fountain of Argyra, in the same manner that Alpheus was said to join himself with Arethusa, till, by the favour of Venus, the remembrance of her was effaced from his mind. Hence it
came so pass, that as many as washed themselves in this river were made to forget their passion. 10

XI
OF THEIR MARRIAGES .
THE first inhabitants of Greece lived without laws and government ; no bounds were prescribed to their passions ; their love, like the rest of their desires, was unconfined, and promiscuous mixtures, because forbidden by
no human authority, were publicly allowed . The first that restrained this
liberty was Cecrops, who, having raised himself to be king over the peo
ple afterwards called Athenians, amongst many other useful institutions introduced that of marriage .! Others ascribe the honour of this institu
tion , together with the invention of dancing, to Erato, one of the Muses ;
but some rather understand the story of the marriage solemnity , the regi lar conduct of which, they say , was first ordered by Erato. However that be, it was in process of time received by all the Greeks ; for no sooner did
they begin to reform their savage and barbarous course of life, and join themselves in towns and societies, than they found it necessary to confine the unruly lusts of men, by establishing lawful marriage, with other rules of good manners .
Marriage was very honourable in some of the Grecian commonwealths,
and was very much encouraged by their laws, as the abstaining from it was discountenanced , and in some places punished ; for the strength of states consisting in their number of people, those that refused to contribute
to their increase were thought very cold in their affections to their country. The Lacedæmonians were very remarkable for their severity against those that deferred marrying, as well as those who wholly abstained from it.?
No man among them could live without a wife beyond the time limited by
their lawgiver, without incurricg several penalties ; as first, the magis trates commanded such, once every winter, to run round the public forum naked ; and to increase their shame, they sang a certain song, the words of which aggravated their crime and exposed them to ridicule. Another
of their punishments was, to be excluded from the exercises, in which, ac cording to the Spartan custom , young virgins contended naked.3 A third
penalty was inflicted upon a certain solemnity,4 in which the women dragged them round an altar, and beat them all the time with their fists.5

Lastly, they were deprived of that respect and observance which the
younger sort were obliged to pay to their elders, and therefore, says Plu tarch , no man found fault with what was said to Dercyllidas, a great cap
tain , and one that had commanded armies, who, coming into the place of assembly, a young man , instead of rising and making room , told him, " Sir, you must not expect that honour from me, being young, which can not be returned to me by a child of yours when I am old .' To these we
may add the Athenian law ,2 by which all that were commanders, orators, or entrusted with any public affair, were to be married , and have children , and estates in land ; for these were looked upon as so many pledges for
their good behaviour, without which they thought it dangerous to commit to them the management of public trusts. Polygamy was not commonly tolerated in Greece, for marriage was
thought to be a conjunction of one man with one woman ; whence ' some will have γάμος derived παρά το δύο άμα είναι, from two becoming one. When Herodotus reports that Anaxandridas the Spartan had two wives,
he remarks that it was contrary to the custom of Sparta . The rest of the Grecian cities, for the most part, agreed in this point with the Lace dæmonians ; only upon some emergent occasions, when their men had been destroyed by war or other calamities, toleration was granted for mar rying more wives ; an instance of which we have at Athens, in the time of Euripides, who, as some say, conceived a hatred against the whole sex , for which he is famous in story, by being harassed with two wives at once .*
Socrates is said to have been married to Xantippe and Myrto at the same time ;5 and Athenæus concludes it was then reputed no scandal, because we never find any of his enemies casting it in his teeth ;6 but some think
the matter of fact may be justly called in question ; and, in Plutarch's
opinion, Panætius of Rhodes, ixavās érteignus, has fully confuted it in his discourse concerning Socrates.
The time of marriage was not the same in all places : the Spartans were not permitted to marry till they arrived at their full strength ;9 and though
I do not find what was the exact number of years they were confined to, yet it appears from one of the sayings of Lycurgus, that both men and women were limited in this affair ;9 that lawgiver, being asked the reason of this enactment, said, his design was that the Spartan children might be strong and vigorous. The Athenian laws are said at one time to have
ordered that men should not marry till above thirty -five years of age ; for
human life was divided by Solon into ten (ebdopádes) weeks, and he
affirmed , that in the fifth of these men were of ripeness to multiply their
able tax on celibacy. Certainly in particular.- Social Condition 8 Xenophon de Repub. Lace the victims would not be spared, of the Ancient Greeks, pp. 94, 95. dæm .

kind ;t but this dependea upon the humour of every law giver, nothing being generally agreed to in this matter. Aristotle a thought thirty -seven
good age, Plato thirty ; and Hesiod was much of the same opinion.s Women married sooner than men ; some of the old Athenian laws per mitted them to marry at twenty -six, Aristotle at eighteen , Hesiod at
fifteen . In the passage referred to, the poet advises that women be per mitted to grow to maturity in four years, i. e. four after ten , and marry
in the fifth, i. e. the fifteenth : others think he means they must continue
unmarried four years after their arrival at woman's estate, i. e. at fourteen years, and marry in the fifth , i . e. the nineteenth ; but as the women were
sooner marriageable than men, so their time was far shorter, it being com mon for men to marry much older than women could expect to do . The times or seasons of the year most proper for marriage were, according to
the Athenians, some of the winter months, especially January, which , for that reason , was called roundoúv :6 hence Antipho, in Terence, the scene
of whose fable is laid in Greece, affirms the soothsayers had forbidden to enter upon matrimony till winter. 7
The most convenient season was when there happened a conjunction of the sun and moon , at which time they celebrated their festival called Oso
groepeia , marriage of the gods.8 Clytæmnestra, in Euripides, having asked Agamemnon when he designed to give Iphigenia in marriage to Achilles, he answers that the full moon was the fittest time :9

Several other days were looked on as favourable or otherwise, in this and all other affairs, which it would be too tedious to enumerate in this place. Most of the Greeks looked on it as scandalous to marry within certain
degrees of consanguinity. Hermione, in Euripides, speaks of the custom
of brothers marrying their sisters with no less detestation than of sons marrying thejr mothers, or fathers their daughters.13 Several of the barbarous nations seem to have overlooked the rules of
decency, and to have allowed unlawful and incestuous mixtures. The

Yet
it
was
not
reputed

,
in

places
,
for
brothers
to
marry
their

;

their

that

.
The Athenians were forbidden to marry ou opentgious, sisters by the same mother, but not ouo tarpious, those by the same father . Of this we have an instance in Archeptolis, the son of Themistocles, who married his sis
ter Mnesiptolema ;6 as likewise in Cimon, who being unable, through ex
treme poverty, to provide a suitable match for his sister Elpinice, mar ried her himself. Nor was this contrary to the laws or customs of Athens; for 8 it was done publicly, and without any fear of the laws. Cornelius Nepos likewise assures us it was nothing but what the custom of their country allowed. We find , indeed, that Cimon is sometimes taxed for
his familiarity with Élpinice ; but this is only to be understood of his tak ing her after she had been married to Callias; for it appears from the
forecited authors, that Cimon first married her himself, then gave her to
Callias, a rich Athenian ; after which he again became familiar with her,
which indeed was looked on as adultery, as she was then another man's wife .
Most

the
Grecian
states
,
especially
those
that
made
any

,
r'e
quired
their
citizens

citizens
;
for
they
looked
upon
the
freedom
of
their
cities
as
too
great
a
privilege
to
be
granted
on
easy
terms
to
foreigners
or
their
children
:
hence
we
find
the
Athenian
laws
sentencing
the
children
of
such
matches
to
perpetual
slavery.10
This
was
not
all
;
for
they
had
a
law
,
that
if
a
foreigner
married
a
free
woman
of
Athens
,
it
should
be
lawful
for
any
person
to
call
him
to
account
before
the
magistrates
called
Thesmothetæ
,
by
whom
,
if
he
was
convicted
,
he
was

a
slave
,
and
all
his
goods
were
confiscated
,
and
one

them

belonging to them as citizens. Lastly, if any man of Athens married a woman that was not free of that city , he was fined a thousand drachms. But these laws were not constant and perpetual: sometimes the necessity of the times so far prevailed , that the children of foreign women enjoyed
all the privileges of freeborn citizens. The old law , which prohibited the men of Athens to marry strangers, having been some time disused , was revived by Pericles, and afterwards, at the instance of the same person ,
abrogated by a decree of the people; but it was again renewed in the
archonship of Euclides, at the motion of Aristophon, when it was enacted that no persons should be free denizens of Athens, unless both their parents were free,3
Virgins were not allowed to marry without the consent of their parents : whence Hero 4 tells Leander, they could not be honourably joined in mar . riage, because her parents were against it :
'Aμφαδόν ου δυνάμεσθα γάμους οσίοισι πελάσσαι, My parents to the match will not consent, Ου γαρ εμοίς τοκείσιν επεύαδεν.- Therefore desist, it is not pertinent.
Hermione, in Euripides, professes she had no concern about her marriage, but left that wholly to her father : Νυμφευμάτων μεν των εμών πατήρ έμός I'm not concern'd, my father will take care Μέριμναν εξει, κούκ εμόν φρονείν τάδε. Of all things that respect my nuptials.
The mother's consent was necessary as well as the father's ;6 nor were men permitted to marry without consulting their parents ; for even the
most early and ignorant ages were too well acquainted with the right' which parents have by nature over their children, to think these had
power to dispose of themselves without their parents' consent. Achilles,
in Homer, refuses Agamemnon's daughter, and leaves it to his father
Peleus to choose him a wife ; and Pamphilus, in Terence, is betrothed by his father Simo.8
When virgins had no fathers, their brothers disposed of them : thus
Creon promised his sister Jocasta to any person who should destroy the Sphinx that infested Thebes ; and Orestes gave his sister Electra to his friend Pylades. When they had neither parents nor brothers, or if their
brothers were not arrived at years of discretion , they were disposed of by their grandfathers, especially those by the father's side ; when these failed ,
they were committed to the care of guardians , called επίτροποι, οι κύριοι. Sometimes husbands, upon their deathbeds,10 betrothed their wives to other persons, as appears from the story of the father of Demosthenes, who gave
his wife Cleobule to one Aphobus, with a considerable portion. When he was dead, A phobus took the portion , but refused to marry the woman : whereupon Demosthenes made his complaint to the magistrates, and ac çused him in an elegant oration. And that this custom was not unusual,

appears from the same orator's defence of Phormio, to whom , being a slave, and faithful in his business, his master bequeathed both his liberty and his wife.
They had several forms of betrothing, such as ? Ilaidwa oráqqu pwr yon σίων δίδωμι σοι την έμαυτού θυγατέρα , 1 give you this my daughter to make you the father of children launfully begotten . The dowry was sometimes mentioned , as 2 when Cyaxares betrothed his daughter to Cyrus, aidwar
σοι, ώ Κυρε , αυτήν την γυναίκα θυγατέρα τε ούσαν εμήν, επιδίδωμαι δ' αυτή tyw zaci pegrino Mndias rãour, 1 give you , Cyrus, this woman, who is my daughter, with all Mediu for her dowry. The persons to be married
plighted their faith to one another, or to their relations. Thus Clitophon and Leucippe swear to each other, the former to be constant and sincere in his love , the latter to marry him, and make him master of all she had .
Ovid makes the next ceremony after betrothing, to be the virgin's oath to her lover : Prunisit patro hanc, hæc el juravit anunti. Her father promis'd , she an oath did take
The ceremony in promising fidelity was kissing each other, or giving their right hands, which was the usual form of ratifying all agreements :
hence Clytæmuestra, in Euripides, calls for Achilles' right hand , to assure her of his sincere intention to marry her daughter :* Join your right hand to mine, a sacred tie Σύναψον, αρχήν μακαρίαν νυμφευμάτων.

In the primitive ages, women were married without portions, being prirchased by their husbands, whose presents to the woman's relations were
called her dowry. Thus we find Shechem bargaining with Jacob and liis sous for Dinah : • Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say
unto me, I will give : ask me never so much dowry and gilt, and I will
give according as ye shall say unto me ; but give me the damsel to wife.” Several instances may be produced to the same purpose , were not this
custom too well known to need farther confirmation ; only thus much must be observed , that when civility and good manners came to be establislied in any place, it was usually laid aside; for Aristotle makes it one argu ment to prove that the ancient Greeks were an uncivilized people , that they used to buy their wives. No sooner , therefore , do we find them
luginning to lay aside their barbarous manjers, than this practice was left 011 ; insomuch tliat Medea, in Euripides, complains that women were the most miserable of all rational creatures, because lying under a necessity of
purchasing their own masters at a dear rate . ' So common became the

custom for women to bring portions to their husbands, that some make the most essential difference between yurn and fandann, wife and concubine, to consist in this, that wives had dowries, whereas concubines were usually without.
Hence men who were content to marry wives who had 110 fortune,
commonly gave them a coixãe, an justrument in writing, acknowledging the receipt of their dowry. The rest of their distinction was chiefly
founded on this ; that she who had a dowry thought it a just title to greater freedom with her husband, and to more respect from him, than such as owed their maintenance to him ; hence Hermione, in Euripides, is enraged
tliat the captive Andromache should pretend to be her rival in the aflec tions of Pyrrhus.?
So sensible was Lycurgus of this, and of some other inconveniences at tending this custon , that, partly for fear wives should domineer over their
hushands, and partly from a desire that men should choose wives more for
the sake of their persons than their money, and that 110 woman's poverty should deprive her of a husband, he quite banished it out of Sparta.3 So
Jon agreed herein with Lycurgus: for all the dowry he permitted the Athenian wives to have, was a little inconsiderable household stuff, and
three suits of clothes : for,' says Plutarch , he would not have marriages for gain or an estate, but for pure love, kind aflection , and to get children . * But some are of opinion that this ordinance had no relation to dowries,
hut only to the gifts called maútok, which the bride brought with her. And that Solon did not prohibit other dowries appears from this, that men who had no sons were allowed to entail their estates upon daughters ; and
every heiress ( the Athenians called them iríxangon) was obliged to marry her nearest relative, lest her estate should go out of the family ; but in
consideration of her dowry, she had the privilege, when her husband was impotent, of consorting with his nearest kinsman ; which law was con
trived against those who, conscious of their own inability, would match with heiresses for the portion's sake, and make use of a law to put violence upon nature ; yet, says my author, it was wisely done to confine her to
lier husband's nearest kinsman, that the children might be of the same
family. A further privilege heiresses had above other women was, that their husbands were obliged to lie with them thrice a month . When
there were any orphan virgins without inheritance, whom they termed
Iñooc1,6 he that was next in blood was obliged to marry her himself, or
settle a portion on her according to his rank ; if he was 11 :17hxoriopédsgevos, one of thefirst rank, five mine, or 500 drachms; if 'Iftiùs, of the second
rank, 300 ; if Zurions, of the third rank, 150 ; but if she had many rela tions equally allied , all of them coutributed their proportions to make up the sum. If there were more than one virgin, their nearest kiusman was

obliged to marry , or give a portion only to one of them ; and upon his re fusal to do this, any person was allowed to indict him before the archon , who was obliged to compel him to his duty ; and if he refused to put the law in execution, was fined 1000 drachms, which were consecrated to
Juno, the goddess of marriage .! It may be farther observed, that afterwards, when money became more
plentiful, the relations of these virgins increased their dowries ; for we are
told 2 that the levteroolopédspero gave ten minæ, and men of inferior qua lity, without doubt, raised their contributions in proportion . When vir gins had no relations to provide for them , and were descended from men
that had been serviceable to their country, it was common for the state to take care of them ; a remarkable instance of this we have in the two
daughters of Aristides, to each of whom the city gave 300 drachms for her portion , Nor is it to be wondered at that the Athenians should make
provision for those that lived in their city , since, hearing that the grand
daughter of Aristogiton, a famous patriot that opposed the sons of Pisistra tus, was in a low condition in the isle of Lemnos, and like to want a hus
band because without a portion, they sent for her to Athens, married her to a person of high rank, and gave her a farm belonging to the city for a dowry. Indeed, however generous the love of the more ancient Atheni
ans was, their successors commonly made money the chief tie of their af . fections: and the later Spartans were of the same humour, even whilst the
laws of Lycurgus were still in being ; for we find that whilst Lysander
was in a flourishing condition, and passed for a wealthy man , several per sons engaged themselves to his daughters, who, seeing after how poor and honest he died , broke off their contract. It is true the Spartans punished
them severely for their perfidy: but that seems to have been done rather out of respect to Lysander's memory 4 than to their ancient constitution , which , as soon as riches began to be possessed and admired at Sparta,
seems to have been laid asleep. The Greeks, indeed, notwithstanding the prohibition of some of their laws, were generally lovers of money, and seem to have matched rather for the sake of that than of other more com
mendable qualifications. Nor was this a late corruption , but entertained even in the primitive times ; for we find Andromache called by Homer 5
Noaúdwgos, i . e, according to Eustathius, Ilonú poixos, possessed of a large dowry : and, before the use of money was common, virgins increased their husbands' estates by adding sheep and oxen to their flocks and herds,
in which the riches of those ages chiefly consisted ; hence they are some
times honoured with the epithet of årpeoißover. And from the expense fathers were at on this account came the proverb,
Παϊς μοι τριτογενής είη μη τριτογένεια
Which is nothing but a father's wish that his children might rather he

boys than girls. As to the value of dowries, nothing can be determined,
the humours of persons, and their particular exigencies, being the laws by which they were usually directed'in such cases ; only it may be observed, that in Crete, sisters were put off with half the shares of their brothers.'
The dowry was named προϊξ, sometimes μείλια , παρά το μειλίσσειν τον a vàge, or idres, q. ñdava , Fapà có ñdesv, as designed to procure the favour and good- will of the person to whom they were given ; sometimes gegen, from dépass, because brought by the wife to her husband. Some of the same names are used for the man's dowry or portion . When the wife had a dowry, it was commonly expected that her husband should make her
a settlement, to be a maintenance for her in case he should happen to be
separated from her by death or divorce ; this was usually a house or land , and was anciently called å rotilenua,2 being a return equivalent to the dowry ; afterwards it was frequently termed ivrimigun, a recompense for
her dowry , or υπόβολον, from υποβάλλειν, because it was υποβαλλόμενον τη
Oggyon, given instead of her dowry ; but where no such security was given , husbands who divorced their wives were obliged to return their dowry.
The same obligation was binding on their heirs, upon refusal to maintain the wives of those whose estates they inherited : hence Telemachus, in
Homer, having suffered many affronts, and sustained great losses by the
suitors of his mother Penelope, yet thought it not prudent to dismiss her to her father Icarius, because that could not be done without returning her portion . The passage referred to seems to intimate farther, that if the woman departed of her own accord, the forementioned obligation became void . Yet, at Athens, in case the woman departed from her husband in the manner which was allowed by the laws, her dowry was restored to her.
It was also the custom there , when any man's estate was confis
cated, that the wife's dowry should be assigned to her. In the same city it was decreed , that he who did not restore to his wise,
when divorced, her dowry , should pay nine oboli every month whilst it was detained, for interest. If this was neglected, an action termed Gitiou dinn was preferred against him in the Odeum by the woman's isitgot" guardian . This is to be understood of the dowries of those of the lowest
class of citizens, to whom, as has been before observeu , Solon allotted 150 drachmæ ; for it being the custom for one perł , which is equivalent to 100
drachme, to bring in an interest of six oboli every month, the interest of 150 drachmæ must amount to nine oboli.
Hence the payment of the dowry was attested by sufficient witnesses, and also by a written instrument called troszące. If these could not be produced, the husband was not obliged to allow his wife a separate main . tenance . If the woman died without children , her dowry was repaid to
the person by whom she had been endowed ;5 for the dowry was intended 3 Odyss. B '. 132.

since it was common to attribute to those that were first eminent for any virtue or excellent quality, the actions of all that afterwards imitated them. Hence we have several Jupiters, Minervas, Bacchuses, Herculeses, &c., the famous exploits of many persons, distant as well in time as place, be ing ascribed to one hero. We find Diana concerned in the preparatory solemnities before all marriages ; for a married life being her aversion ,
it, was thought requisite for all that entered upon it to ask her pardon for dissenting from her. This was done by prayers and several sorts of sacri.. fices, which were called γαμήλιοι ευχαι, προγάμεια , προτέλειοι ευχα or
προτέλεια ; for τέλος and γάμος are terms of the same signification ;? the former denoting marriage, either as a general name for all sorts of rites and ceremonies, or because the longing expectations of married persons are
thereby consummated, and brought to an end, or because persons that are married become complete and perfect men , and renounce all the customs and desires of childhood ; whence yñas, to marry , is termed sesiwohvan,
to be made perfect.3 Married persons are called reas101,4 and are said to
be iv Biw tensiw. The same epithet is commonly given to the gods that had the care of marriage : whence we read of Jupiter téac105, Juno tisíce, 5
&c . These gods were likewise rendered propitious before the nuptials, and the sacrifices, with other devotions offered them, were all known by the same names as those offered to Diana : Juno's were called, besides
their general name, 'Houríasic, from her own name, which in Greek is
" Hpa . Several other deities had their share in these honours. Minerva, surnamed Iluptéros, the virgin , had a peculiar title to them at Athens, on the same account that they were paid to Diana : and it was not permitted a virgin to marry till she had performed her devotions in the temple dedi
( ated to this goddess in the citadel.6 Venus likewise, and all the rest of the governeo. Isoi, gods superintending marriage, were invoked. The
Lacedæmonians had a very ancient statue of ’ Appodían " Hg., Venus Juno, to which all mothers sacrificed when their daughters were married.8 The most ancient Athenians paid the same honour to Heaven and Earth, which were believed to have a particular concern in marriages, the latter of them being rendered fruitful by the benign influences of the former, and there
fore a fit emblem of marriage.9 The Fates and Graces being thought first
to join , and then preserve the tie of love, were partakers of the same re spect; 10 and it is probable that several other deities at different places, and
for different reasons, claimed a share therein. The day on which this ceremony was performed was usually that which immediately preceded the marriage :11 it was commonly called youndía, and xovpsūtis,12 from the
custom they had of shaving themselves on this occasion, 13 and presenting their hair to some of the forementioned deities, or to other gods to whom

they lay under particular obligations. Some offered their hair to Diana and the fatal sisters.1 At Troezen the virgins were obliged, before they
entered into marriage bonds, to consecrate their hair to Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, who died for his chastity.2 The Megarensian virgins offered their hair, with libations, at the monument of Iphinoë, the daugh
ter of Alcathous, who died a virgin ; the Delians to Hecaërge and Opis :* the Argians and Athenians to Minerva. But these names, younaia and zougtūris, were at Athens peculiar to one day of the solemnity called apa turia , when fathers had their children enrolled in the public register, at
which time they offered sacrifices for their prosperity, with a particular respect to their marriages, and commonly shaved off some of their hair to be dedicated to some of the deities, especially to her in whose honour that festival was celebrated. But though the time of presenting their hair might not be constantly the same, yet the custom itself seems to have been universally observed, not only by women but men, who rarely failed
to perform this ceremony upon their arrival at years of maturity. Some of their locks were carefully preserved for this use ; and therefore when Pentheus, in Euripides, threatens Bacchus to shave his hair, the young god tells him it would be an impious action, because he designed it for
an offering to some deity. The hair was called raóxopos Igentúgios, be cause presented to a god as an acknowledgment of his care in their edu cation , The deity thus honoured was commonly Apollo, as Plutarch
reports, when he tells us that Theseus, according to the custom of Grecian youth , took a journey to Delphi to offer the first- fruits of his hair to the
god of that place . But this could not concern the poorer sort, to whom such journeys would have been too expensive : nor were those of better quality under any strict obligation to pay this honour to Apollo, as it was
not unusual to do it to other gods, such especially as were thought to have protected their infancy from danger, and preserved them to manhood . Instances are needless in a thing so well known ; only it may be necessary
to observe, that the deities of rivers were commonly thought to have a
title to this respect : which conceit (seems to have proceeded from the opinion of some philosophers, who thought that all things were first pro duced out of water, and are still nourished and rendered fruitful by it :
whence the poets took occasion to give the epithet xovgorgópos to the dei ties of the waters, as well as to Apollo, those being no less instrumental
to the growth and increase of living creatures, than the sun, whose influ ences without moisture can contribute nothing to the production or pre
servation of life; hence both were looked on as deserving of returns of gratitude for the first gift, as well as for the continuance of life. As an
example of hair presented to rivers, I would only trouble you with that of Achilles, who preserved his hair as a present to Sperchius, on condition that he should return home in safety, and afterwards shaved it, when he

The custom of nourishing hair, on religious accounts, seems to have prevailed in most nations. The Jews had their Nazarites. Osiris the
Egyptian consecrated his hair to the gods . And we find in Arrian's ac count of India, that it was a custom there xouậu rū Dem, to preserve their
hairfor some god, which they first learned , as that author reports, from Bacchus.
Before the marriage could be solemnized, the other gods were consulted
and their assistance implored by prayers and sacrifices, which were usu ally offered to some of the deities that superintended these affairs, by the parents, or other relations of the persons to be married . Nor can these
offerings be thought the same with those already mentioned , and called # goríasse, since we find them plainly distinguished by Euripides, in a dia
logue between Agamemnon and Clytæmnestra , concerning the marriage of their daughter Iphigenia :3 ΚΑ. Πρoτέλεια δ' ήδη παιδός έσφαξας θεα ;

When the victim was opened , the gall was taken out and thrown be bind the altar,4 as being the seat of anger and malice, and, therefore, the aversion of all the deities who had the care of love, as well as of those who
became their votaries. The entrails were carefully inspected by sooth sayers ; and if any unlucky omen presented itself, the former contract was
dissolved, as displeasing to the gods, and the nuptials prevented. The
same happened upon the appearing of any ill-boding omen without the victim. Thus we find in Achilles Tatius, that Clitophon’s intended mar
riage with Calligone was hindered by an eagle, that snatched a piece of the sacrifice from the altar. The most fortunate omen that could appear was a pair of turtles, because of the inviolable affection which those birds
are said to have for each other. The same may be observed of topwers, crows, which were thought to promise long life or happiness, from the
length of their own lives, which is proverbially remarkable, and the per petuity of their love ; for when one of the mates is dead, the other remains
solitary, ever after ; hence the appearance of those birds single boded sepa ration or sorrow to the married couple ; for this reason it was customary at nuptials to sing Kopin ixxógsı xogárny, maiden , drive away the crow , whereby the maids were put in mind to watch, that none of these birds,
coming single, should disturb the solemnity ; or perhaps to avert the per icious influences of that unlucky omen , if it happened appear.

other remedy against evil omens was, to write over the doors of their houses, MHAEN EIXITO KAKON, let no evil enter. To this they some times joined the name of the master of the house, as appears from a newly
married person who wrote thus upon his house : “Ο ΤΟΥ ΔΙΟΣ ΠΑΙΣ ΗΡΑΚΛΗΣ ΚΑΛΛΙΝΙΚΟΣ ΕΝΘΑΔΕ ΚΑΤΟΙΚΕΙ , ΜΗΔΕΝ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ ΚΑΚΟΝ.
Here dwells Hercules, the victorious son of Jupiter ; let no evil enter . This gave occasion to the jest of Diogenes, who, seeing upon the door
of a vicious fellow , the forementioned prayer, said , Then let not the master of the house enter.'1
The bridegroom's garments were all dyed. However that be , both the married persons and their attendants were richly adorned , according to
their rank . They were likewise decked with garlands of various herbs and flowers. 3
The herbs were usually such as some way or other signified the affairs of marriage, as those sacred to Venus,

bride, who had given her lover some
trouble in courting her, and gaining her affections, which she recompensed after
wards by the pleasantness of her con versation . The house in which the
nuptials were celebrated was likewise
-decked with garlands ; a pestle was tied
the door; a maid carried a sieve; and the bride 6 herself bore opún γετον, φρύγετρον, or Φρύγητρον ,7 an earthen vessel, in which barley was parched , to signify her obligation to attend to the business of her family. The bride was usually conducted in a chariot from her father's house
to her husband's in the evening,8 that time being chosen to conceal her blushes . She was placed in the middle, her husband sitting on one side, and, on the other, one of his most intimate friends, who, for that reason,
was called cégoxos . This custom was so frequent, that when the bride

,

They were sometimes attended with singers and dancers.
The song they were entertained with in their passage was called equé TELON Méaos, from águce, the coach in which they rode, the axletree of which they burned when they had arrived at the end of their journey, thereby
signifying that the bride was never to return to her father's house. The Rhodians had a peculiar custom of sending for the bride by a public crier.
When the bridegroom entered the house with his bride, it was customary
to pour upon their heads, figs and various other sorts of fruits, as an omen
of their future plenty. The day of the bride's departure from her father was celebrated in the manner of a festival , and called Προσχαιρητήρια. It
seems to have been observed at her father's house, before she departed , being distinct from the nuptial solemnity, which was kept at the bride groom's house, and began at evening, the usual time of the bride's arrival there .
The bride being come to the bridegroom's house, was entertained with
a sumptuous banquet, called by the same name with the marriage, viz.
γάμος , and hence δαίειν γάμον is to make a nuptial entertainment.8 The reasons of this entertainment (to pass by the joy and mirth it was
intended to promote) were two : the first was , the respect due to the gods of marriage, who were invoked before the feast, and had no small share in it ; and it is thought by some, that most of the Grecian festivals were
first observed on this ground. The second was, that the marriage might
be made public ;9 for all the relations of the married couple were invited as witnesses of their marriage, and to rejoice with them : hence the
young man in Terence concludes, the marriage he there speaks of could not be presently consummated , because time was required to invite
friends, and to make necessary preparations :10 Ducenda est uror, ut ais; concedo tibi: 'The money, he must wed the girl; I grant it; Spatium quidem apparandis nuptiis, But then some little time must be allow'd Vocandi, sacrificandi dabitur paululum .

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 625
During the solemnity the company diverted themselves, and honoured the gods of marriage with music and dancing : we seldom read of a marriage without them. All the songs were called υμέναιοι, Or υμένες":1 Πολύς δ ' υμέναιος ορώρει.

This name was taken from the frequent invocations of Hymen, or Hyme næus, the god of marriage, always made in these songs . This Hyme. næus, we are told , was an Argian ,4 whom they received into the number of their gods, and thus remembered for a generous action in delivering certain Athenian virgins from the lust and cruelty of some Pelasgians, Others derive the word “ TÒ TOū óvoũ veísıv, from the married couple's
inhabiting together ; others, lastly, from úpny, which signifies the mem brana virginalis.
About the time of their entertainment several significant ceremonies took place, relating some way or other to the state of marriage. One at Athens consisted in the introduction of a boy, covered with thorn -boughs
and acorns, carrying a basket full of bread, and singing " Equyov xanày súgos čipesuvov, I have left the worse and found the better . This saying
· was used at one of their festivals, when they commemorated their change
of diet from acorns to corn ; but seems at this time to have signified also the happiness which the married persons were entering upon, and that marriage was preferable to a single life. The Lacedæmonians had a
custom of carrying about a sort of cakes, made in various figures, and
called nugábaves, whilst they danced, and commended the bride in songs.” When the dances were ended , the married couple were conducted to the marriage -bed,6 called in Latin lectus genialis; in Greek xaíon rupepidin,
or yourzh, or , when the persons were first married , and in their youth
κουριδίον λέχος. It was as richly adorned as the rank of the person would permit ; the covering was usually of purple,7
In the same room there was commonly placed a side-bed , called xaron παράβυστος ,8 υπέρ του την παιδα μη αθυμήσαι.9 But before they went to bed the bride bathed her feet10 in water which the Athenians always
fetched from the fountain Callirhoe, afterwards called 'Exvsázpouvos, from
nine cisterns supplied by it with water. The person that brought it was
a boy nearly allied to one of the married couple, and whom from his office they termed courpopógos.11 This being done, the bride was lighted to bed with several torches; for a single torch was not enough.12

: 626 GRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.
The relations of the married persons assisted in tlie solemnity, and it was looked on as no small misfortune to be absent; the mothers especially were assiduous in lighting torches when their sons' wives entered the
houses. Thus Jocasta , in Euripides, severely chides Polynices for mar rying in a foreign country, because she, with the rest of his relations and
friends, were deprived of their offices at his nuptials .
The bride's mother had no less a right to this office ; for we find Cly tæmnestra, in the same author, though professing all due submission to Agamemnon , when desired by him to absent herself from Iphigenia's
marriage, stedfastly refusing it, as a thing against all justice, notwithstand ing his promise to perform her part of the ceremony.3 4 The married couple being shut up together in the chamber, the laws of Athens obliged them to eat a quince, by which was intimated that their
first conversation ought to be pleasing and agreeable. The husband then

loosed his wife's girdle, whence avan zárny is to deflower , and your a vosa
Suvos, a woman that is no longer a virgin . This girdle was not, as some seem to fancy, worn by maids only, but was used as well after marriage as before , being designed to secure the weaker sex from the sudden
attempts of men inflamed with lust ; hence Nonnus calls it caópwv, and
when he introduced the satyrs endeavouring to embrace certain virgins, we find their honour secured by it. This farther appears from the men tion which authors make of untying women's girdles in child -birth , and from calling only such girls épuitpos, not having a girdle, as were not ar rived at maturity.
At this time the young men and maids stood without the door, dancing
and singing songs, called itibaképeic, from Járopios, the bride- chamber , and making a great noise, by shouting and stamping with their feet, which was termed κτυπία, Or κτυπίoν,3 and was designed to drown the cries of
the bride . Lest the women should go to her assistance, one of the bride groom's friends stood sentinel at the chamber door, and from his office was
called Jugwgós. This song, as likewise all the rest, was termed ' Tusyosos, and consisted of the praises of the bridegroom and bride, with wishes for
their happiness. They returned again in the morning, saluted the mar ried couple, and sung itibancusce systirà, awakening songs, for that was the name of the morning songs, which were designed to awake and raise the bridegroom and bride ; as those sung the night before were intended
to dispose them to sleep, and are on that account termed tichápice 70 Mentirà, lulling songs.5 Νεόμεθα καμμες ες όρθρον , επεί κα πράτος αοιδός When first the crowing cock shall wake the morn, * FE srås klainoy drao u dorpe za dapár When through his feather'd throat he sends his Ομάν, Υμέναιε , γάμον επί τώδε χαρείης. we'll return , O Hymen, Hymen, at this feast rejoice. CREECH.
The solemnity lasted during several days. The day before the mar riage was termed apoatare, as preceding that on which the bride did
availaotus tū vuugiw, lodge with the bridegroom . The marriage -day was called yápos; the day following, according to Pindar, irißons, which word signifies a day added to any solemnity ; Hesychius6 calls it waaía , which may perhaps be derived from guaív, because the former day's mirth was, as it were, repeated , hence the Romans call it repotia ; unless, for παλία we might be allowed to read παλαια , and then it would be the same with Athenæus' whos apspee ;? for śwhos denotes any thing that has
ceased to be new ; hence Tully calls a book whov, when men's first and tager inquiry after it is cooled : and Athenæus, in another place, has op
posed τας ακμαίας γάμων ημέρας to the το έωλον της συμποσίας :8 others call the second day επαύλια, or έπαυλία . The third day was termed άπαυλία ,

this upon the seventh day after marriage ; others will have it so called, because the bridegroom lodged apart from his bride at his father - in -law's
house. It is possible both may be in the right, and that both bridegroom and bride might lie at her father's house, but in different beds. Others
make druúão, to be the same with étaba.c ; whence a seeming difficulty arises, since those two words import contraries, one seeming to denote that the bride lodged apart from the bridegroom, the other with him ; but this may be easily solved, by applying Én cúncc to her lodging with her
husband, and énavace to her departure from her father's house.! On the day called úraúnic the bride presented her bridegroom with a
garment called aravanangia . Presents, called sometimes úraúna, some
times itaúrvce, were likewise made to the bride and bridegroom , by the bride's father and friends; these consisted of golden vessels, beds, couches, plates, ointment-boxes, combs, sandals, and all sorts of necessaries for
housekeeping, which were carried in great state to the house by women , who followed a person called zarnpágos, from carrying a basket in the man ner usual at processions, before whom went a boy in white apparel, with a
torch in his hand. It was also customary for the bridegroom and his
friends to give presents to the bride, which they called evanahuathaice ; and Ηesychius is of opinion that the third day was called ανακαλυπτήριον,, because then the bride first appeared publicly unveiled . Suidas tells us that the gifts were so called , because she was then first shown to her
bridegroom . For the same reason they are sometimes called Isúigntou , οπτήρια , αθρήματα , and προσφθεγκτήρια, because the bridegroom had then leave to converse freely with her ; for virgins before marriage were under
strait confinement, and were rarely permitted to appear in public or con verse with men ; and, when allowed that liberty, wore over their faces a
veil, which was termed záaurrgov, or nadúatea, and was not left off in the presence of men till this time ; and hence some think that the bride
was called νύμφη, από του νέον, (i , e. πρώτως,) φαίνεσθαι, that being the first time she appeared in a public company unveiled . It is in allusion to this
custom that the poet speaks of Pluto’s gists to Proserpine, when she un veiled herself, as we read in those verses of Euphorion , cited by the scho
liast upon Euripides:4
Τρά ποτε Κρονίδης δώρον πόρο Περσεφονείη Pluto to Proserpine a present gave , Είνι γάμοις, ότι πρώτον ο πωπήσασθαι έμελλε, Νυμφιδίον σπείροια παρακλίνουσα καλύπτρα ».. And at the marriage show'd herself uncover'd.
It is told of the sophist Hermocrates, in relation to this custom , that having a woman not very agreeable imposed upon him by Severus the
Roman emperor, and being asked his ανακαλυπτήρια, when she took of her veil, the replied , εγκαλυπτήρια μεν ούν τοιαύτην λαμβάνων, it would be more proper to mahe her a present to keep her veil on, unless herface was
more agreeable .
When first she laid aside her maiden veil,

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE . 629
The ceremonies of the Spartan marriages being different from all others, I have reserved them for this place, and shall set them down in Plutarchi's
own words :1 • In their marriages, the bridegroom carried off the bride by
violence ; and she was never chosen in a tender age, but when she had arrived at full maturity. Then the woman that had the direction of the
wedding, cut the bride's hair close to the skin, dressed her in man's clothes, laid her upon a mattress, and left her in the dark . The bride
groom , neither oppressed with wine nor enervated with luxury, but per fectly sober, as having always supped at the common table, went in pri
vately, untied her girdle, and carried her to another bed. Having staid there a short time, he modestly retired to his usual apartment, to sleep with the other young men ; and observed the same conduct afterwards,
spending the day with his companions, and reposing himself with them in the night, nor even visiting his bride but with great caution and appre
hensions of being discovered by the rest of the family ; the bride at the same time exerted all her art to contrive convenient opportunities for their private meetings. And this they did not for a short time only, but some
of them even had children before they had an interview with their wives in the day time. This kind of commerce not only exercised their tem perance and chastity , but kept their bodies fruitful, and the first ardour of
their love fresh and unabated ; for as they were not satiated like those that
are always with their wives, there still was place for unextinguished de sire ."

this to any man that was afraid of having too great a number of children ; the Athenians likewise did it upon very slight grounds, but not without giving a bill, in which was contained the reason of their divorce, to be
approved , if the party divorced made an appeal, by the chief magistrate . The Spartans, though marrying without much nicety in choice, seldom divorced their wives ; for we read that Lysander was fined by the magis trates called ephori on that account: and though Aristo, one of their kings,
put away his wife with the approbation of the city, yet that seems to have been done rather out of an earnest desire to have a son to succeed in his
kingdom, which he could not expect by that woman, than according to the
custom of his country. But whatever liberty the men took , their wives were under a greater restraint; for it was extremely scandalous for a wo
man to depart from her husband : hence we find Medea 3 complaining of the hard fate of her sex, who had no remedy against the unkindness of men, but were first under the necessity of buying their husbands with large
portions, and then of submitting to their ill usage without hope of redress :

The Athenians were somewhat more favourable to women, and allowed them to leave their husbands upon just occasions ; but not without making
appeal to the archon, and presenting him a bill of grievances with their
own hands. Plutarch 4 has a story of Hipparete, Alcibiades' wife, ' who, ' he tells us, was a virtuous lady, and fond of her husband, but at last growing impatient of the injuries done to her bed by his continual enter
taining of courtezans, as well strangers as Athenians, she departed from him , and retired to her brother Callias' house, Alcibiades seemed not at
all concerned at it, living on still in his former lewd course of life ; but the law requiring that she should deliver to the archon in person, and not by proxy, the instrument whereby she sued for a divorce, when, in obedi ence to it, she presented herself before him , Alcibiades came in , took her
away by force, and carried her home through the forum , no man daring to oppose him , or take her from him , and she continued with him till her
death. Nor was this violence to be thought a crime ; for the law , in
making her who desires a divorce appear in public, seems to design that her husband should have an opportunity of discoursing with her, and of endeavouring to retain her.' Persons that divorced their wives were
obliged to return their portions ; if they failed to do this, the Athenian laws obliged them to pay her nine oboli a month for support, for which

the woman's guardian was empowered to sue at the court kept in the Odeum . It may be observed, lastly, that the terms expressing the sepa ration of men and women from each other were different: men were said
FOTÉTev, to dismiss their wives ; & toúsiy, to loose themfrom their obli
gation ; čxbúrkev, to cast them out ; ÉnTÉMmuY, to send them away ; aud
prévau, to put them away ; but wives, étod siruv, to leave or depart from their husbands.
It was not unusual to dissolve the marriage tie by consent of both par
ties ; when this was done, they were at liberty to dispose of themselves as they pleased in a second match ; an instance of this we find in Plutarch, who reports, that when Pericles and his wife could not agree, and became
weary of one another's company, he parted with her, (willing and consent ing to it), to another man . There is something more remarkable in the
story of Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, who, falling desperately in love with Stratonice his mother -in -law , married her with his father's consent,3
The Romans had the same custom , as appears from Cato's parting with his wife Martia to Hortensius, which, as Strabo assures us, was a thing
not unusual, but agreeable to the practice of the old Romans, and some other countries.
What may appear more strange is, that it was customary in some parts of Greece to borrow one another's wives. At Athens, Socrates fent his
wife Xantippe to Alcibiades, and the laws of that city permitted heiresses, when they found their husbands deficient, to make use of his nearest rela tion . Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver,6 thought that the best expedient against jealousy was to allow men the freedom of imparting the use of their
wives to whom they should think fit, that so they might have children by
them : this he accounted a very commendable piece of liberality, and laughed at those who thought the violation of their bed such an insupport able affront as to revenge it by murders and cruel wars. He had a good
opinion of that man , who, being old, and having a young wife, recom mended some virtuous and andsome young man , that she might have a
child by him to inherit the good qualities of such a father, and who loved this child as tenderly as if begotten by himself. On the other hand, an honest man who loved a married woman , upon account of her modesty
and the comely features of her children , might with good grace beg of her i husband his wife's conversation , that he might have a scion of so good'y a
tree to transplant into his own garden ; for Lycurgus was persuaded that
children were not so much the property of their parents as of the whole commonwealth , and therefore would not have them begotten by the first comers, but by the best men that could be found. Thus much, says Plu
tarch, is certain , that so long as these ordinances were observed, the women
were so far from that scandalous liberty, which has since been objected to

further told by others, that strangers, as well as citizens of Sparta, were allowed the same freedom with their wives, provided they were handsome men , and likely to beget lusty and vigorous children :1 yet we find their
kings were exempt from this law , that the royal blood might be preserved unmixed , and the government remain in the same lineal descent.
Notwithstanding this liberty, which was founded upon mutual consent, they accounted all other adulteries the most heinous crimes in the world ,
and whilst they kept to their ancient laws, were wholly strangers to them.2 Geradas, a primitive Spartan, being asked by a stranger, what punishment their law had appointed for adulterers ? replied, there were no adulterers in his country : but, returned the stranger, suppose there were one, and the crime were proved against him, how would you punish him ? He
answered , that the offender must pay to the plaintiff a bull, with a neck so long as that he might reach over the mountain Taygetus, and drink of the river Eurotas that runs on the other side. The man , surprised at this, said , why, it is impossible to find such a bull. Goradas smilingly replied, it is just as possible to find an adulterer in Sparta.
The punishments inflicted upon adulterers in Greece were of various sorts ,
To begin with the heroic ages : if the rapes of women may be allowed
room in this place, we shall find that they were revenged by many cruel and bloody wars . According to Herodotus they gave rise to the constant
enmity that existed for many ages between Greece and Asia, and which was not allayed till the latter was conquered, and became subject to the former,3 Lycophron agrees with Herodotus, and affirms that the rape of lo by the Phoenicians incensed the Greeks against the inhabitants of Asia ; and, after frequent injuries committed, and wars waged on both sides, they
reduced the Asian empire under the dominion of the Europeans under Alexander of Macedon . +
But however the truth of this may be questioned, there being in those
early ages no distinction of the world into Greeks and barbarians, nor any common association those amongst themselves, or against the others ;
yet we have a remarkable instance of a long and bloody war, occasioned by Paris' rape of Helen. What sentence the heroic ages passed upon adultery may appear, from the l'evenge of Atreus upon his brother Thyestes, who was entertained at a banquet with the flesh of his own son , for defiling Aërope, Atreus' wife ; and other examples of the cruelty of the men of those times, against such as committed adultery with their wives
or other near relations ; but more clearly from the punishments inflicted by laws or magistrates upon such offenders, who were usually stoned to death ;
hence Hector, in Homer, tells Paris his crime in stealing another man's wife deserves no less a punishment than aáivos Xotiv, a coat of stone,

The same punishment seems to have been customary iu more eastern countries ; the Jews were particularly obliged to inflict it both on men and women, as appears from the express words of their law.2 Rich adulterers
were sometimes allowed to redeem themselves with money, which was
called Morgcúrgic, and was paid to the husband of the adulteress ; hence Mars being taken with Venus, Homer's gods all agreed that lie must pay his fine to Vulcan. Nor would Vulcan consent to set his prisoner at
liberty till Neptune had engaged for the payment of it.4 It appears from the same place to have been customary for the woman's father to return all the dowry he had received of her husband : and hence Vulcan threatens to secure both Mars and Venus in chaius till that was
done,5 Some think that this sum was refunded by the adulterer, because it was reasonable he should bear the woman's father harmless, since it appears
not that the fine imposed on Mars was a distinct sum ; for upon Neptune's
becoming surety for it, Vulcan loosed him from his bonds without farther
scruple . Another punishment was putting out the eyes of adulterers, which
seems to have been no less ancient than the former, and may he thought just and reasonable , as depriving the offender of that member which first admits the incentives of lust. Fabulous writers tell us that Orion hav
ing defiled Candiope, or Merope, had his eyes put out by Enopion , the
lady's husband, or, according to others, her father.6 Phoenix, the guar dian of Achilles, suffered the same punishment for defiling Clytia, his father's concubine.? Homer indeed has no mention of this punishment,
but only informs us that his father having discovered him , prayed that he might never have any children,S which Tzetzes I thinks is meant by losing his eyes, because children are dearer to parents , and afford them greater comfort than their most necessary members ; but this interpretation is
forced, and contrary to the sense of mythologists, ancient as well as mo
dern, who relate the story agreeably to the literal meaning of Lycophron's words. The Locrians observed this custom in later ages, being obliged
thereto by Zaleucus their lawgiver, whose rigour in executing this law is very remarkable ; for, having caught his own son in adultery , he resolved
to deprive him of sight, and remained a long time inexorable, notwith
standing the whole city was willing to remit the punishment, and request ed him to spare the youth : at length, unable to resist the people's impor
tunity, he mitigated the sentence, and redeemed one of his son's eyes by
another of his own ,10 so at once becoming a memorable example of justice and mercy.

At Gortyn, in Crete, there was another method of pumishing adulter ers ; they were covered with wool, an emblem of the softness and efsemi
blacy of their dispositions, and in that dress carried through the city to the magistrate's house, who sentenced them to åripíc , ignominy, whereby they
were at once deprived of all their privileges, and of their share in the mall agement of public business.?
If credit may be given to Pausanias, 2 the first who made a law and con stituted punishments against adulterers was Hyettus, an inhabitant of Ar gos, who, having caught Molurus, the son of Arishas, too familiar with his
wife, slew him, and fled to Orchomenus, the son of Minyas, then king of that city of Boeotia which hore his name ; the king received him kindly , and gave him part of his territories, where he called a village Hyettus,
after his own name, and established severe laws against adultery.
The Athenian punishments seem to have been arbitrary, and left to the discretion of the supreme magistrate ; hence we find Hippomenes, one of the posterity of Codrus, and archon of Athens, pronouncing a very odd
sentence upon his own daughter Limone, and the man caught in adultery
with her : he yoked them to a chariot till the man died , and afterwards shut up his daughter with a horse, and so starved her to death.3. Some
time after, Draco being invested with power to enact laws, left adulterers at the mercy of any man that caught them in the act, who had free license
to dismember, murder, or treat them in what other manner he pleased, without being called to account for it ; which punishment was the same that had been before appointed for this crime by Hyettus," and was after wards continued by Solon . Several other punishments were ordered by
Solon against the same crime, when proved by evidence in lawful judica ture. A man that ravished a free woman was fined 100 drachms ; one that enticed her twenty , or, as some say, 200, it being a greater jujury
to the husband and family of a woman to corrupt her mind than her body ; but he that forced a free virgin was to pay 1000, and whoever deflowered one was obliged to marry her. If, however, the virgin or her mother
had accepted any present from her gallant, he was not obliged to make her
his wife, but she was looked on as a common strumpet . When a man
was thrown into prison on suspicion of adultery, he was allowed to prefer his appeal to the magistrates called thesmotheta , who referred the cause
to proper judges ; and these, in case the crime was proved against him,
liad power to lay on him , with the exception of death, any punishment they pleased. There was another remarkable punishment for adulterers,
called ruputia peos or guepuvídwors, the part being put for the whole ; quan

The Greeks appear to have had a more favourable opinion of concubin
age ; for they were allowed , and that without scandal , to keep as many concubines as they pleased ; these they styled rannaxides they were
usually women taken captives, or bought with money, and were always inferior to lawful wives, whose dowry, noble parentage, or some other ex cellency, gave them pre -eminence. There is continual mention of them in Homer. Achilles had his Briseis, and in her absence Diomede ; Pa
troclus his Iphis ; Menelaus and Agamemnon , and, to mention no more,
the wisest, gravest, and eldest of all, Phoenix and Nestor, had their Nor is it to be wondered at that heathens should run joto such
excesses, when the Hebrews, and those the most renowned for piety, such
as Abraham and David, allowed themselves the same liberty. Yet the Grecian wives always envied their husbands this freedom , looking on it as
an encroachment upon their privileges: hence Laërtes, in Homer, though he had a great respect for his slave Euryclea, never took her to his bed for
fear of his wife's displeasure . The mother of Phoenix persuaded him to defile his father's concubine, to free her of so troublesome a rival ;5 and,
not to multiply instances, Clytemnestra, having slain her husband Aga memnon, wreaked her malice upon Cassandra his concubine .
Harlots were no less common than concubines, being tolerated in most of the Grecian and other commonwealths. Nor was the use of them
thought repugnant to good manners, the wisest of the heathen sages being of this mind . Solon allowed common whores to go publicly to those who
hired them , and encouraged the Athenian youth to indulge in occasional intercourse , to hinder them from making attempts upon the wives and daughters of his citizens.8
Cato, the Roman censor, was of the same opinion, as appears from the
well known story , that meeting a young nobleman of Rome coming out of the common stew, he commended him for diverting himself in that place .

I forbear to mention other instances, the testimony of Cicero being suf ficient to confirm what I have said, when he challenges all persons to name
a time in which men were either reproved for this practice, or not coun tenanced in it. Nor can it be wondered at that heathens allowed themselves
this liberty, when the Jews looked on it as lawful; they were indeed for
bidden to commit adultery, and fornication also was prohibited under se
vere penalties ; but these prohibitions 2 were thought to concern only women of their own nation , as their law did not extend to foreigners ; and
we find accordingly that public stews were openly tolerated amongst them , and that women residing there were taken into the protection of the go vernment, as appears from the two harlots that contended about a child,
and were heard in open court by king Solomon ,3 But the Jewish women were not permitted to prostitute their bodies; and therefore strange or foreign women are sometimes taken for harlots, as when Solomon advises
his son to embrace wisdom and understanding, that they may keep
him from the strange woman , from the stranger which flattereth with her words;4 and to arm him against the allurements of harlots, he
tells him the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil, but her end is bitter as wormwood , sharp
as a two- edged sword . " The Athenians, in this as in many other things, had the same custom with the Jews ; for though severe penalties were laid on those who defiled women that were citizens of Athens, yet
foreigners had the liberty of keeping public stews, and their harlots, like those among the Jews, were, for that reason , called Zivas, strange women .
The harlots of the primitive ages were not so wholly divested of modesty as afterwards, for they never went abroad barefaced, but, as was the cus tom of other women, covered themselves with veils or masks; nor were
they allowed, as some think, to prostitute themselves within the cities ; this custom seems to have been derived from the eastern nations: for we
find Tamar, in Genesis," when she had a mind to appear like a harlot, * covering herself with a veil, and sitting in an open place by the way to
Timnath ;' but it may be, her design in placing herself there was only that she might meet with Judah or his son , whom she desired to entice to her
embraces. We find , however, that in after ages, when harlots were cer tainly permitted to reside in cities, they used to post themselves in the highways, as places of resort. In Solomon's reign they frequented the
cities. Yet some ages after, when it is certain they were no more re strained from abiding in cities than in his days, they resorted to places of general concourse out of them, such as highways, especially where several
ways met, and had tents erected to wait in for custom.? At Athens they chiefly frequented the Ceramicus, Sciros, and the old forum , in which stood the temple of Venus llévènpos, where Solon permitted them to pros

titute themselves. They also frequented very much a certain forum in
that part of the haven Piræeus which was called otoà fecexpà , the long por tico, the parts whereof are thus described by Julius Pollux, dūruce, futó ριον εμπορίου δε μέρη, καπηλεία , και πορνεία . In other ports also there
were commonly great numbers of stews. In some places harlots were distinguished from other women by their apparel.) What sort of habit this was is not certain ; but if the Athenian custom was in this, as in many other things, taken from the Jews, we
may conclude that their whores wore flowered garments; for the Athe
nian lawgiver thinking it necessary to distinguish women of virtuous con versation from harlots by some open and visible mark , ordered that the former should never appear abroad but in grave and modest apparel, and that the latter should always wear flowered garments. Hence Clemens
of Alexandria has remarked , that as fugitive slaves are known by their stigmata , ούτω την μοιχαλίδα δείκνυσι τα ανθίσματα , 80 Howered garments are an indication of a harlot .? The same law was enacted among the
Locrians by Zaleucus, and was also observed at Syracuse ;4 for, though harlots were tolerated in the Grecian commonwealth, yet they were gen
erally infamous, and consisted chiefly of captives and other slaves. Hence it was forbidden by the laws of Athens to derive the name of a harlot from any of the sacred games, as Athenæus hath observed from Polemo's de
scription of the Acropolis ; whence that author seems to wonder how it
came to pass that a certain harlot was called Nemea, from the Nemean games, 5
Corinth is remarkable for being a nursery of harlots, there being in that
city a temple of Venus, where the readiest method of gaining the favour of the goddess was to present her with beautiful damsels, who from that
time were maintained in the temple, and prostituted themselves for hire. We are told by Strabo,6 that there were no fewer than a thousand there at one time. Hence rogivosásıv, to act the Corinthian , is įtasgsúev, to com mit fornication. Λεσβιάζειν, λεσβιών, and φοινικίζειν, are used in the same sense, the Lesbians and Phoenicians being infamous for this vice. Aso
Brázs also signifies an impure way of kissing, whence it is interpreted by the same author, πρός άνδρα στοματιύειν, and λεσβιας is expounded by λαι ráorgio , a harlot. The Corinthians were a genteeler sort of harlots, and admitted none to their embraces but such as were able to deposit a consi derable sum. This gave rise to the proverb,
Ου παντός άνδρός ές Κόρινθον έσθ' ο πλούς . Which Horace has thus translated :
Non euivis hominum contingit adire Corinthum . To Corinth every person cannot sail.
Some rather refer it to the famous Corinthian strumpet Lais, and others
assign other reasons. Their occupation indeed was very lucrative, so that

those whom beauty and talents recommended frequently raised great estates. A remarkable instance of this we have in Phryne, who ofiered to rebuild the walls of Thebes, when demolished by Alexander, on condi tion that the Thebans would engrave on them this inscription :

OF THE CONFINEMENT AND EMPLOYMENTS OF THEIR WOMEN.
The barbarous nations, and amongst them the Persians especially ,' were
naturally jealous, clownish, and morose towards their women , not only their wives, but their slaves and concubines, whom they kept so strictly,
that no one ever saw them except their own family ; when at home they were cloistered up ; when they took a journey they were carried in coaches or wagons, close covered at the top and on all sides : such a carriage was prepared for Themistocles when he fled into Persia , to keep him se
cret ; so that the men who conveyed him told all they met and discoursed
with upon the road, that they were carrying a young Grecian lady out of Ionia to a nobleman at court.
From the manner in which Plutarch relates this story, it is evident that neither he nor his countrymen the Greeks, approved of the severity used by barbarous nations towards their women ; yet they themselves, though

remitting somewhat of the Persian rigour, kept their women under strict
discipline, and were no less excelled by the Romans in this respect, than they themselves surpassed the barbarians; for, whereas the Roman women were allowed to be present at public entertainments, and to converse with
the guests, and were complimented by their husbands with the best rooms in their houses, those of Greece rarely or never appeared in strange com
pany but were confined to the most remote parts of the house.l For this purpose the Grecian houses were usually divided into two parts, in which the men and women had distinct mansions assigned. The
part in which the men lodged was towards the gate, and was called avdqwr, or ävdgwritis. The part assigned for the women was termed yuvaixáv, yuvasxwvírns, or yuvaixwvītis; it was the remotest part of the house, and
behind the aian, before which there were also other parts, called gódomos, and προαύλιον.. Thus, in Homer, the sons of Priam were all placed by themselves, and separated from his daughters, who lived in more remote places . The women's chambers were called mégsor Jánapos, as being placed at the top of the house ; for the women's lodgings were usually in the uppermost rooms, which was another means of keeping them from
company ; hence Helen is said to have had her chamber in the loftiest past of the house :
“Η δ' εις υψόροφον θάλαμον κίε δια γυναικών. Into the upper chamber Helen went.
Penelope appears to have lodged in such another place, to which she
ascended by a κλίμαξ : By a long ladder came down from her room .
The word signifies a staircase, but in this place may as well denote a lad
der, which seems to have been used in those days, when architecture was not much understood ,5
These upper rooms, especially at Lacedæmon , were sometimes called
wa, wia , or inseñal, which words being distinguished only by the accent,6 ( the use of which seems not to have been known by the ancient Greeks)

Sometimes they were so strictly confined, that they could not pass from one part of the house to another without leave, hence Antigone, in the
same poet, obtains her mother's leave to go to the top of the house to view the Argian army that besieged Thebes ; notwithstanding which her guar dian searches the passage, lest any person should have a sight of her, which , he says , would be a reflection upon her honour and his own fide. lity. New -married women were under almost as strict a confinement as vir
gins, and were thought, by appearing out of doors, to endanger their re putation . According to Menander," the door of the air was the farthest a married woman ought to go : πέρας γαρ αύλιος θύρα The laws do not permit a free -born bride 'Ελευθέρα γυναικι νενομιστ’ οικίας .

To the same purpose was the emblem of Phidias, representing Venus treading upon a tortoise,9 which carries its house upon its back . When they went abroad , or appeared in public, they covered their faces with veils; as we find of Penelope, when she descended from her apart

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 641
To prevent all private assignations, Solon enacted that no wife or matron ( for virgins were always strictly confined ) should go from home with more
than three garments, or carry with her a larger quantity of meat and drink than could be purchased for one obolus, or with a basket of more than a cubit in length. He farther ordered, that she should not travel in the
night without a lighted torch before her chariot. Afterwards, it was de creed , at the instance of Philippides, that no woman should appear in public undressed, under the penalty of paying 1000 drachms. This law
was carefully put in execution by the officers called yuvaszovópos, and que salxozóouoi and a tablet, containing an account of the mulcts thus incurred
was publicly exposed upon a plane tree (Trátavos) in the Ceramicus.] It was likewise customary for women to have attendants,? who seem to have been women of age and gravity. These women not only attended
their ladies when they went abroad, but kept them company at home, and had the care of their education when young, and were therefore called
τροφοί .. Nor were women only appointed to this charge ; for Antigone, in
the forecited tragedy of Euripedes, has an old man for her governor. It was likewise customary to commit women to eunuchs, who performed all
the offices of maids, and were usually entertained by persons of quality.3 The first that made eunuchs was Semiramis. T'he barbarous nations
were in general much fonder of them than the Greeks, who looked upon it as an inhuman piece of cruelty, thus to mutilate man . Phocylides has
left a particular caution against it :6

place, that their usage was very different according to the temper of their husbands or guardians, the value of their fortunes, and the humour of the place or age they lived in .
The Lacedæmonian women observed fashions quite different from all their neighbours: their virgins went abroad barefaced , the married women
were covered with veils ; the former designing ( as Charilus replied to one that inquired the reason of that custom ) to get themselves husbands, where
as the latter aimed at nothing more than keeping those they already had . We have a full account of the conduct of the Spartan women in the follow

it at the very source, taking into consideration their conception and birth , by regulating the marriages. For he did not, as Aristotle says, desist from his attempt to bring the women under sober rules. They had , indeed ,
assumed great liberty and power on account of the frequent expeditions of their husbands, during which they were left sole mistresses at home, and so gained an undue deference and improper titles ; but notwithstanding
this he took all possible care of them . He ordered the virgins to exercise
themselves in running, wrestling, and throwing quoits and darts; that their
bodies being strong and vigorous, the children afterwards produced from them might be the same , and that, thus fortified by exercise, they might
the better support the pangs of childbirth, and be delivered with safety . In order to take away the excessive tenderness and delicacy of the sex, the
consequence of a recluse life, he accustomed the virgins occasionally to be
seen naked as well as the young men , and to dance and sing in their pre

sence on certain festivals. There they sometimes indulged in a little
raillery upon those that had misbehaved themselves, and sometimes they sung encomiums on such as deserved them, thus exciting in the young men a useful emulation and love of glory . For he who was praised for
his bravery , and celebrated among the virgins, went away perfectly happy: while their satirical glances thrown out in sport, were no less cutting than
serious admonitions ; especially as the kings and senate went with the other citizens to see all that passed . As for the virgins appearing naked ,
there was nothing disgraceful in it, because every thing was conducted
with modesty, and without one indecent word or action . Nay it caused a simplicity of manners and an emulation for the best habit of body ; their ideas too were naturally enlarged, while they were not excluded from their share of bravery and honour. Hence they were furnished with sentiments and language, such as Gorgo the wife of Leonidas is said to have made use of. When a woman of another country said to her, “ You of Lacedæmon are the only women in the world that rule the men : ' she answered , “ We
are the only women that bring forth men . '
These public dances and other exercises of the young maidens naked, in sight of the young men, were moreover incentives to marriage : and to use Plato's expression , drew them almost as necessarily by the attractions of love, as a geometrical conclusion follows from the premises, 1
Afterwards, when the laws of Lycurgus were neglected, and the Spartans had degenerated from the strict virtue of their forefathers, their women also were ill spoken of, and made use of the freedom which their lawgiver
allowed them to no good purposes ; insomuch that they are censured by ancient writers for their wantonness and excessive desire of unlawful plea sures , and branded by Euripides, with the epithet of avdogucersis, possessed
with furious love of, and, as it were, running mad after men .

called Torrotátopes, or Tpirotárgsis. Who these were, or what the origin of their name, is not easy to determine. According to Orpheus their proper names were Amaclides, Protocles, and Protocleon , and they presided over
the winds. According to Demo they were the winds themselves ; but what business the winds or their governors have in generation is difficult to
imagine. Another author tells us that their names were Cottus, Briareus,
and Gyges, and that they were the sons of Ougavòs and rũ, Heaven and Earth . Philochrus likewise makes Earth their mother, but instead of Heaven , substitutes the Sun or Apollo for their father; whence he seems to account as well for their being accounted the superintendents of genera
tion as for the name of Tgitorátogss, for being immediately descended from two immortal gods, themselves, says he, were thought agíto catégis, the third fathers, and therefore might well be esteemed the common parents of
mankind, and from that opinion derive those honours which the Athenians
paid them as the authors and presidents of human generation , The goddess who had the care of women in childbed was called Elas θυια , or Ελλήθεια , Sometimes 'Ελευθώ :
Μόχθον 'Ελευθούς You're past the pongs o'er which Eleutho reigns. ' Εκφύγες. She is called in Latin Lucina . Both had the same respects paid by wo
and the same titles and epithets given them. Elithyia is called by Nonnus , 3 -- 'Aρήγων θηλυτεράων. The succouring deity in child - birth .
Ovid speaks in the same manner of the Latin goddess :* Gravidisfacilis Lucina puellis. Lucina, kind to teeming ladies.
The woman in Theocritus invokes Elithyia :5 "Ενθα γαρ Ειλείθυιαν εβώ σατο λυσίζωνον

'The Roman women called for Lucina's assistance ; whence Ovid : Tu voto parturientis ades. Thou kindly women in their travail hear'st.
Several other things are common to both. As Elithyia was styled udivax
itcowyös, Inacãy outsipa, &c. so likewise Lucina was graced with various appellations denoting her care of women . Their names, indeed , appear to
have distinct originals, yet both have relation to the same action ; for Einduice is derived atò toŨ lasúby, from coming, either because she came
to assist women in labour, or rather from her being invoked to help the infant žexsolar sis to pãs , to come into the light or the world . Lucina is
taken from lux, light, for the same reason. The Greek name twoQigos, sometimes attributed to this goddess, is of the same import with the Latin
Lucina, and is derived ÅTÒ TOŬ Qãs págsıv, from bringing light, because it was
hy her assistance that infants were safely delivered out of their dark man sions, to enjoy the light of this world. In allusion to this, the Greek and
Latin goddesses were both represented with lighted torches in their hands ;

which reason seems far more natural than that which some assign , viz.
ότι γυναιξίν εν ίσω και πυρ εισιν αι ωδίνες , that the pain of bearing children is no less exquisite than that of burning .”
Who this Elithyia is, authors are not agreed : some will have her to be a Hyperborean , who came from her own country to Delos, and there assisted Latona in her labour : they add that this name was first used in
Delos, and was thence derived to other parts of the world . Olen , the
first writer of divine hymns in Greece, makes her the mother of Cupid, whence it might be inferred she was the same with Venus, were not Pausanias, who cites this passage of Olen , against it, when he brings this as a different account of Cupid's descent from the received one of his being Venus's son . The same poet, cited by the same author,4 will have her to be more ancient than Saturn , and the self same with IIETOW
uion, which is the Grecian name for Fate. Others make her the same with Juno, Diana, the Moon, &c. What appears most probable is, that all the tool yavédnos, i. e, those deities who were thought to have any
concern for women in childbed, were called Elithyiæ and Lucinæ , for these are general names , and are sometimes given to one deity, some times to another.
Juno was one of these goddesses ; whence the woman thus invokes her : Juno Lucina, fer opem . Juno Lucina, help, assist the labour.
There are several remarkable stories concerning Juno's power in this
affair, of which I shall only mention that about Alcmena, who having incurred this goddess's displeasure by being the mistress of Jupiter, and
being with child by him , Sthenelus's wife being likewise with child at ihe same time, but not so forward as the other, Juno first obtained that
le who should be first born should rule over the other, then altered the
course of nature, caused Eurystheus to be born of the wife of Sthenelus, and afterwards Hercules of Alcmena ; and hence Hercules was always
subject to Eurystheus, and undertook his famous labours in obedience to his commands.
The daughters of this goddess were employed in the same office, and dignified with the same title,5
The moon was another of these deities, insomuch that Cicero will have Luna, the name of the moon in Latin , to be the same with Lucina ; and
it wasnot without reason that the moon was thought one of the deities that had the care of childbirth , since , as, several philosophers are of
opinion, her influences were very efficacious in carrying on the work of generation ,
Diana being commonly reputed the same with the moon, was likewise thought to bear the same office , and that not in her celestial capacity only, and as bearing the same character with the moon, but as frequent

ing these lower regions and traversing the woods. Hence she is called
in Theocritus, uogóo tomas, the common epithet of Elithyia : ' Αλλά τεή βασίλεια , μoγοστόκος "Αρτεμίς έστι.
Orpheus gives her various other titles relating to this affair : 2
Πασιφαής , δαδούχε θεά δίκτυνα , λοχεία , 'Ωδίνων επαρωγέ, και ωδίνων άμυητέ , Λυσίζωνε , &c.
The epithets pasopógos, psgéobios, &c. which denote the giving of life and light, being likewise attributed to Proserpine, it is probable that she also was thought to be concerned for women in labour ; and this cannot appear strange, if we consider her as the same goddess with Diana, who
being in three different capacities, as conversant in heaven, earth , and hell, has three distinct names : in heaven she is reason, the Moon ; on
earth " Aposuess, Diana ; in hell Megaspávn, Proserpine ; hence come those epithets by which the poets denote her threefold character : rgájogos, triformis, tergemina, with several others.
One end of invoking these goddesses was, that the women might be delivered without pain , which was thought an infallible token of the
divine favour.3 Nay, so great an opinion had they of this favour, that the gods were believed to vouchsafe it to none but the chaste and the
virtuous ; and hence it came to be looked on as a convincing proof of a woman's honesty.4
Another token of divine favour was thought to be conferred when they brought forth twins.5
They had likewise other means to procure an easy delivery, one of which was, to hold in their hands palm branches, tokens of joy and con
quest, and used as emblems of persons raised from great afflictions to prosperity ; it being observed of that tree, that the hanging of heavy weights upon it is a means to cause it to branch out to a greater height. Latona, when she was delivered of Apollo, made use of this expedient to ease her pain :6
When handling palm Latona brought you forth . Φοίνικος ραδινής χερσίν εφαψαμένη..
The ancient Athenians used none but men -midwives, it being forbid
den by their laws that women or slaves should study or practise medicine.
This proving fatal to many women, whose modesty suffered them not to intrust themselves in the hands of men, one Agnodice disguised herself
in man's clothes, studied medicine under a certain professor, called Hero philus, and having attained to a competent skill in that art, revealed her
self to her own sex, who agreed with one consent to employ none but her ; upon this the rest of the physicians, enraged at their want of business, indicted her before the court of Areopagus, as one that corrupted men's

wives. To obviate this accusation she disclosed her sex ; the physicians
then prosecuted her with great eagerness, as violating the laws and en croaching upon the men's prerogative ; when , to prevent her ruin , the principal matrons of the city came into court and addressed themselves to
the judges, telling them , that they were not husbands, but enemies, who
were going to condemn the person to whom they owed their lives.' Upon this the Athenianš repealed the old law , and permitted free women to undertake this employment."
No sooner was the child brought into the world than they washed it with water.2 The Lacedæmonians bathed their new -born infants, not in water , as was the custom of all other countries, but in wine, to prove the temper
and complexion of their bodies ; for they had an idea that weakly children would fall into convulsions, or immediately faint, on their being thus
bathed, and that, on the contrary, those of a strong and vigorous consti
tution would acquire a greater degree of firmness by it, and get a temper in proportion like steel in the quenching. The next action observable is cutting the child's navel, which was done by the nurses , and called ομφαλοτομία ; 4 hence arose the proverb, ομφαλός voù sú rispostujon, thy navel is not cut ; which is as much as if we say, you are an infant, and scarcely separated from your mother . There was
a place in Crete called Omphalium , from óuponós a navel, because Jupiter's navel-string was cut there ."
Then the nurse wrapped the child in swaddling bands, lest its limbs,
being tender and flexible, should be distorted ; the Spartan nurses, how ever, were so careful and experienced, that without using swaddling
bands, their children were all straight and well proportioned . Their management of children differed likewise from all the rest of the Greeks
in several other respects, for they accustomed them to any sort of meat, and sometimes to bear the want of it ; not to be afraid in the dark, or to
be alone ; nor to be froward , peevish, and crying, as they are generally in other countries, through the impertinent care and fondness of those who
take charge of them . On this account Spartan nurses were frequently hired by people of other countries ; and it is reported that she who suckled Alcibiades was a Spartan .”

The Lacedæmonians religiously observed this latter ceremony.
In other places they placed their infants in a thing bearing some re semblance to whatever sort of life they designed them for. Nothing was
more common than to put them in vans, or conveniences for winnowing corn , in Greek aixva , which were designed as omens of their future riches and affluence. This was not always a real van , but commonly an
instrument bearing the figure of it, composed of gold, or other material.3
One thing more is to be observed concerning the Athenians, before we dismiss this head, viz. that it was a common practice among them , espe
cially in families of rank , to place their infants on dragons of gold. This custom was instituted by Minerva, in memory of Erichthonius, one of
their kings, who had feet like those of serpents, and being exposed to the wide world when an infant, was committed by that goddess to the custody of two vigilant dragons:4 Κείνω γαρ ή Διός κόρη

on this day was, ŐT, ŠTÍStivov rñ owTnpią, because by this time they began to conceive hopes that it would live ; for weakly infants, rà misiota årees gsitat po rñs éßdóuns, commonly die before the seventh . 1
Some kept the eighth day after the infant's birth, calling that yevídanos huipa , the birth -day, because solemnized in memory of the child's nativity. The same day was kept every year after during the life of the child. The same day was also observed by the Jews for their circumcision , as has
been remarked by the ancient interpreter upon the following passage of Terence :2 Another gift when Madam's brought to bed ; Ferietur alio munere, ubi hera pepererit: Another too when Master's birth -day's kept, Porto alio autem , ubi erat prero natalis dies, And they initiate him . Geta , moreover, shall be struck for more ; COLMAN .
Others named their children on the tenth day after their birth, on which also they invited their friends to an entertainment, and offered sacrifices to the gods: 3 Τίς σι μήτηρ εν δεκάτη τόκον ώνόμασενκαι What mother on the tenth day nam'd you?
Some are of opinion that the tenth day was the same with 'Aj piągópice,
but, although some persons might join the two solemnities, they were
commonly distinct : to celebrate this day was called δεκάτην θύειν, δεκάτην αποθύειν , δεκάτην εστιάσαι, 4
When the child received its name, whether on the tenth, or any other
day, a considerable number of friends were present. This custom was observed not only by the Greeks, but at Rome, and in most other parts of the world ; the chief end of it seems to have been , to prevent controversies that might afterwards arise, when the child came into business, and was under several civil relations, if his name was not certainly known.

grandfather's name ; and, in St Luke's gospel, we find the friends of
Zacharias strangely surprised when his son the Baptist was called John, because none of his relations were known by that name, The actions of parents were frequently perpetuated by the names of
their children : 1 so Cleopatra, or rather Marpissa ( for Eustathius and the
old scholiast are of different opinions herein ), was called Halcyone, because when she was ravished by Apollo, her mother was no less afflicted than the halcyon is wont to be for the loss of her young. 2 Hector's son Scamandrius was named by the Trojans Astyanax, because his father was
TOŪ ŽOT:05 ávač, the defender of the city of Troy ; for the original signifi cation of čva's is no more than a saviour or defender ; whence the gods are commonly called ανακτες.3 Ulysses was called 'Οδυσσεύς , δια το οδύσσεσθαι Tùy Aúróżuxos, from the anger of his grandfather Autolgcus .*
Men's own actions, complexions, or condition , frequently gave occasion to their names . Thus Edipus was named διά το οίδεϊν τους πόδας: because
his feet were swollen.5
The son of Achilles was first called Tluppòs, from his ruddy complexion , or the colour of his hair, afterwards Nson tóksmos, from undertaking the
management of the Trojan war when very young . To mention other instances is needless, wherefore I shall conclude this head with Plutarch's words, in which we have an account of the Roman as well as of the Grecian
method of imposing names:6 " Hence (i. e, from the taking of Corioli, the chief city of the Volscians) came Coriolanus the third name of Caius Mar
cius. By which it appears that Caius was the proper name; that the second name, Marcius, was that of the family ; and that the third Roman appel
lative was a peculiar note of distinction, given afterwards on account of some particular act of fortune, or signature, or virtue of him that bore it.
Thus among the Greeks additional names were given to some on account of their achievements, as Swahe, the preserver, and Kanaínzos, the victo
rious; to others for something remarkable in their persons, as púoxwy, the gor -bellied, and reoròs, the eagle- nosed ; or for their good qualities, as Eusgyéons, the benefactor, and pincédsages, the kind brother; or for their
good fortune, as Eydaljewe, the prosperous, a name given to the second prince of the family of the Batti. Several princes also have had satirical names bestowed upon them : Antigonus, for instance, was called Aúrur,
the man that will give to-morrow , and Ptolemy was styled Adjugos, the buffoon, from the fond opinion he had of his own wit and pleasantness. But appellations of this last sort were used with greater latitude among the Romans. One of the Metelli was distinguished by the name of Anca
dýpectos, because he went a long time with a bandage, which covered an ulçer he had in his forehead : and another they called Celer, because with surprising celerity he entertained them with a funeral show of gladiators, a few days after his father's death. In our times, too, some of the Ro

mais receive their names from the circumstances of their birth ; 'as that
of Proculus, if born when their fathers are in a distant country ; and that of Posthumus, if born after their father's death ; and when twins come into the world, and one of them dies at the birth , the survivor is called Vopiscus. Names are also appropriated on account of bodily imper.
fections ; for amongst them we find not only Sylla, the red, and Niger, the black ; but even Cacus, the blind, and Claudius, the lame ; such per sons by this custom being wisely taught, not to consider blindness or any other bodily misfortone as a reproach or disgrace, but to answer to appel lations of that kind as their proper names .
Sometimes the Greeks took a more compendious way to dispose of their children , either killing them outright, or exposing them in some desert place, or elsewhere, to the mercy of fortune. To do the latter of these
they termed εκτίθεσθαι, or αποτίθεσθαι : and it was not accounted a cri minal or blame-worthy action, but was permitted by some lawgivers, and expressly encouraged and commanded by others. The Lacedæmonians were remarkable for their behaviour in this matter; for they did not allow fathers to rear their children when inclined to do it, but obliged
them to carry all their new -born infants to certain triers, who were some of the gravest men in their own tribe, and kept their court at a place called
Aiorn, where they carefully viewed such as were brought to them ; if they found them lusty and well favoured , they gave order for their education , and allotted a certain proportion of land for their maintenance ; but if weakly or deformed , they ordered them to be cast into a deep cavern
in the earth, near the mountain Taygetus, thinking it neither for the
good of the children themselves, nor for the public interest, that they should be brought up, since nature had denied them the means both
of happiness in themselves, and of being serviceable to the public, by not enduing them with a sufficient measure of health and strength. On this
account it was that new-born infants were bathed in wine, as has been already observed . The place into which the Lacedæmonians cast their infants was called 'Arobitas hence à totidsoba is usually taken for exposing
with a design to destroy: whereas ixridsole commonly bears a milder
sense ; for many persons exposed their children when they were not will ing they should perish, only because they were unable to maintain them :
daughters especially were thus treated, as requiring more charges to edu cate and settle them in the world than sons ; whence the saying cited out of Posidippus:
Υιον τρίφει τις καν πένης τις ών τύχη, A man, though poor, will not expose his son , θυγατέρα δε εκτίθησι καν η πλούσιος.. But if he's rich, will scarce preserve his daughter.
The Thebans disliked this barbarous custom, and had a law by which
the practice of it was made a capital offence ; such as were not able to pro vide for their children were ordered to carry them as soon as born to the magistrates, who were obliged to take care of their maintenance, and

who, when they were grown up, used them as slaves, taking their service as a recompence for the charge and trouble they had been put to. 1
Children were usually exposed in their swaddling clothes and laid in a
vessel. Aristophanes, speaking of Edipus, calls it örtguxos :3
-Αυτον
γενόμενον
Χειμώνος άντος εξέθεσαν εν οστράκω ..
It is sometimes termed rúmgo , whence yureilu is the same with εκτίθεσθαι and χυτρισμός with έκθεσις..
The parents frequently tied jewels and rings to the children they expos ed, or any other thing by which they might afterwards discover them, if
providence took care for their safety. Another design in thus adorning these infants was, either to encourage such as found them to nourish and educate them , if alive, or to give them burial, if dead , Terence intro
duces Sostrata assigning another reason for this practice, when she relates how she had caused her daughter to be exposed , to save her from her hus

Women during their confinement were looked on as polluted ; whence the Athenians enacted a law that no woman should bring forth in Delos,
an island consecrated to Apollo, because the gods were believed to have an
aversion to all sorts of pollution . Iphigenia in Euripides tells us, that no person who was guilty of murder, or had touched a woman in childbed, or a corpse , could be admitted to the altar of Diana , 7
When the fortieth day came, the danger of childbirth being then over, they kept a festival, called from the number of the day 7 : 50Upakorrós at this time the woman , having been before purified by washing, entered into some of the temples, most commonly into that of Diana, which, from her i labour, till that time she was not allowed to do ;' here she returned thanks
for her safe delivery, and offered sacrifices. It was likewise the custom to present her garments to Diana, who acquired hence the surname of Xırávn ; 9 and women after their first child offered their zona to the same
goddess, who was on that account called Avoisórn, and had a temple at Athens dedicated to her under that title. 10

OF THEIR DIFFERENT SORTS OF CHILDREN , WILLS, INHERITANCES ; THE DUTIES OF CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS, &c.
The scholiast on Homer mentions four different sorts of children : 1. Oi
yřnoso or iteysvsīs, children born in lawful marriage. 2. oi védos, those
born of concubines or harlots. 3. oi onórios, those whose fathers were not
known, wherein they were distinguished from the former. 4. oi sapos víces, such as were born of women, who, though vitiated before marriage, were still taken for virgins. This and other divisions of children I shall pass by, only taking notice of three sorts,

Those were reputed lawfully begotten who were begotten in lawful
marriage, which was measured by different rules, as the affairs of every
state required . In some places, whoever had a citizen for his father, though his mother was a foreigner; in others, those also who were born
of free women , when their fathers were foreigners, passed for legitimate,
and inherited the freedom of the city in which they were born, and all privileges of citizenship . Most commonwealths at their first constitution ,
and after great losses of inhabitants by war, plagues, or otherwise, seem to have taken this course to replenish and strengthen their country with
people ; but when that exigency ceased, and it became necessary to re strain the too great increase of free citizens, they commonly enacted that none should be esteemed legitimate but such as were descended from
parents who were both citizens ;' and this order was dispensed with or
abrogated as oft as fresh occasion required. This may be observed at Athens in the time of Pericles ; for when Pericles was in a flourishing
condition , and had sons lawfully begotten, he proposed that Solon's old law should be revived, by which it was enacted that they only should be
reputed true citizens of Athens whose parents were both Athenians, whereupon almost five thousand lost their freedom , and were sold for slaves. But Pericles himself afterwards having lost all his legitimate
sons, so far prevailed with the Athenians, that they cancelled the law , and permitted him to enrol his natural son in the register of his own ward by his paternal name, which was a thing the Nóbos, natural children ,
were incapable of, as having nothing to do with the name, family, or estate of their father, as neither were they allowed to intermeddle in sacred or civil affairs. Lest any person should insinuate such children into the city register, in which all the citizens' names were enrolled ,
1 Aristoteles Politic. Di, 5 . 2 Aristophanis Scholiastes, Avibus,

they made severe scrutinies in every borough, which were termed drcy. pious, by which all persons not duly qualified were ejected from the
city. There was also a court of justice in Cynosarges, a place in the suburbs of Athens, where examination was made 'concerning such per
sons. Nor were such as had only one parent an Athenian, though allowed the freedom of Athens, reputed equal to such as were Athenians of the
whole blood ; for we find,2 that while these performed their exercises at the schools within the city, those of the half blood , with the foreigners, were only allowed to exercise at Cynosarges, where was a gymnasium dedicated to Hercules, who himself was illegitimate, as not being de scended from two immortal gods, but having a mortal woman for his mother . Themistocles, offended at this reproach, persuaded several of the young noblemen to accompany him to anoint and exercise themselves.
at Cynosarges, whereby he seemed with some ingenuity to take away the distinction between the truly noble and the stranger, and between those of the whole and those of the half blood of Athens,3
There was never any time that I know of (whatever some may pretend to the contrary ), when illegitimacy was not reckoned a disgrace, unless in those ages when men lived without laws and government, allowing promiscuous mixtures, and all other sorts of uncleanness. Eustathius will
have concubines and their sons to have been as honourable as wives and
sons begotten in lawful marriage, about the time of the Trojan war ;4 but the whole course of antiquity seems to be clearly against him ; for I do
not find a single instance, in any ancient author, which can countenance this opinion . It is possible, indeed, that concubines might sometimes be treated with greater respect than lawful wives, and bastards than legiti mate children ; but that was owing to the partial affections of husbands,
which women, by their superior beauty and arts of insinuation, might gain, but can by no means be attributed to the practice of those times.
The chief reason Eustathius alleges is, that Agamemnon calls Teucer vobos, when encouraging him to fight; at which time it would have been
very improper to have given him opprobrious language. The hero's words run thus :5
Τεύκρα, φίλη κεφαλή, Τελαμώνιε, κοίμανε λαών , Smite ever thus the foe, that hope once more Βίλλ' ούτως αϊ κόν τε φόως Δαναοίσι γίνηαι May cheer the Greeks, and Telamon rejoice, Πατρί το σώ Τελαμώνι, 3 σ' έτρεφε τυτθον εόντα, Who rear'd thee, though his spurious son, with Και σε νόθον περ 86ντα κομίσαατο η ενί οίκω..

In which words Agamemnon excites Teucer, the natural son of Telamon , to behave himself with courage, by two reasons : first, that so doing, he would be instrumental in delivering the Greeks from their enemies, who daily got ground of them ; the other, that such an action would be a
credit to his father, for whose honour he ought to have a more tender concern , since he had received such extraordinary benefits from him, as

having, notwithstanding his illegitimacy, been carefully educated, and that not in any remote place, where he might have been neglected , but
under Telamon's own eye, and in his own house . This is so far from establishing an equality between legitimate children and bastards, that it
evidently shows the contrary , the particle irse after sólox plainly implying that such care of bastards was something more than common in those
days. Nor can the poet be blamed for making Agamemnon call him by such a name, since the thing was no secret, but was known to all the
Greeks, and , no doubt, appeared every day from Teucer's submissive be
haviour to Ajax, his half -brother, and the lawful son of Telamon,

How shameful for a slave Against us, by our vengeance not chastis'd , To hear such arrogance ?
Some are of opinion that ɔnly the natural children of kings, and of persons
of rank , were equal to those who were lawfully begotten. It may be true that such children were above the legitimate ones of private persons; but
that they were of the same dignity with the legitimate issue of princes does not appear ; nay , the contrary is manifest from the forementioned
example of Teucer, both of whose parents were princes. The same might be proved by other instances ; Ion, for example, who had Apollo for his father, and Creusa, the wife of an Athenian king, for his mother, is
yet introduced by Euripides complaining of his hard fortune in being illegitimate .
It may indeed be objected, that natural children sometimes succeeded to the kingdoms of their fathers ; but that only happened for want of legi timate issue, and was not always allowed even in such cases. places the bastards of private persons likewise inherited the estates of their fathers, when there were no lawful children or relations :3 but where there
were relations, bastards had no share, as is plain from a dialogue between Pisthetærus and Hercules, in Aristophanes, where Hercules, having been persuaded by Neptune that he was heir -apparent to Jupiter, is undeceived by Pisthetærus, who tells him, that heing illegitimate he had no right of

Those who had no legitimate sons were obliged by the Athenian laws
to leave their estates to their daughters, who were necessitated to marry their nearest relations, or else to forfeit their inheritance, as we find to
have been practised likewise by the Jews, many of whose laws seem to l.ave been transcribed by Solon . These virgins, whether sole heiresses,

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 659
or only co - heiresses, were called by Solon himself wigirangítidos, by others Targovxou, or (which is the most common name of all) irixangor, and sometimes mevdan.' These and their nearest relations were empowered to claim marriage from one another, and if either party refused , the other preferred an action, which was termed iridirá sobar, which word was
applied to all sorts of lawsuits; hence inheritances about which they went to law were termed xangovouíao izidras those of which they received quiet possession , everídomas. Others state, that whether there was any dispute or not, the nearest relation was obliged to claim his wife with her inheritance in the archon's court if he was a citizen, in that of the pole marchus if only a sojourner ; and that this was termed imidirá sobo , and
might be done in any month of the year except in Scirrophorion , the magistrates being then busy in making up and returning their accounts.2 The law concerning the marriages of heiresses gave occasion to a comedy
of Apollodorus, entitled 'Eridiazépiros, or ' Eridixaçouévn , as Donatus reads, understanding it of the virgin's suing for a husband. This was translated into Latin by Terence, and called Phormio , and in it we have these verses , mentioning the law of which I have been speaking :
Ler est, ut orbæ qui sint genere proximi, The law commands that orphans marry those Iis nubant, et illos ducere eadem hæc lexjubet. That nearest are allied, and that the men Consent to join with these
We also find it ordered , that when men had given a daughter in marriage, and after that died without sons to inherit their estates, their nearest
relation had power to claim the inheritance, and to take the woman from her husband ; and this Isæus 3 tells us was a common practice.
Persons who had no lawful issue were allowed to adopt whom they pleased , whether their own natural sons, or, by consent of the parents, the sons of other men . But such as were not rúgiou favtūv, their own mas
ters, were excepted ; such were slaves, women , madmen , infants, that is,
all such as were under twenty -one years of age ; for these not being capa ble of making wills, or of managing their own estates, were not allowed
to adopt heirs to themselves. Foreigners being excluded from the in heritance of estates at Athens, if any such was adopted, he was made free of the city. The adoption being made, the adopted person had his name enrolled in the tribe and ward of his new father ; this was not done at the
same time in which the children begotten of themselves were registered, but on the festival called Orpynasa, in the month Thargelion . The Lacedæmonians were very cautious and wary in this affair, and for the
prevention of rash and inconsiderate adoptions, had a law that they should be confirmed in the presence of their kings. Adopted children were
called παιδες θετοί, or είσποιητοι, and were vested with all the privileges and rights, and obliged to perform all the duties, of such as were begotten by their fathers: and being thus provided for in another family, they

ceased to have any claim of inheritance or kindred in the family which they had left, unless they first renounced their adoption, which the laws
of Solon allowed them not to do, except they had first begotten'children bearing the name of the person who had adopted them ; thus providing against the ruin of families, which would have been extinguished by the desertion of those who were adopted to preserve them . If the adopted persons died without children , the inheritance could not be alienated from
the family into which they were adopted , but returned to the relations of the person who had adopted them . The Athenians are by some thought
to have forbidden any man to marry after he had adopted a son, without leave from the magistrate. And there is an instance in Tzetzes' Chi liads,3 of one Leogoras, who being ill used by Andocides the orator , who was his adopted son, desired leave to marry . It is certaio, however, that
some men married after they had adopted sons ; and if they begot legiti mate children, their estates were equally shared between those begotten and adopted. It may be observed in this place, that it was an ancient custom for legitimate sons to divide their father's estates by lots , all
having equal share, without respect to priority of birth , but allowing &
small pittance to such as were unlawfully begotten.4 Such as had neither legitimate nor adopted children, were succeeded by their nearest relations, as appears from the forecited dialogue between
Hercules and Pisthetærus. This custom was as ancient as the Trojan war, being mentioned in Homer, when he relates how Diomedes slew the two only sons of Phænops:5 " Ενθ' 3 γε τους ανώριζε, φίλον δ' ξαίνυτο θυμόν

sessions belonged to the prince, the commonwealth , or the supreme magis trates, as the laws of each state directed .
The Grecian practice concerning wills was not the same in all places: some states permitted men to dispose of their estates; others wholly deprived them of that privilege . Solon was much commended for his law
concerning wills ; for before his time no man was allowed to make any , but all the wealth of deceased persons belonged to their families ; but he
permitted them to bestow it on whom they pleased , esteeming friendship a stronger tie than kindred , and affection than necessity, and thus put every man's estate in the disposal of the possessor. He did not, however,
allow sorts of wills, but required the following conditions in all persons that made them :
1. That they must be citizens of Athens, not slaves or foreigners; for then their estates were confiscated for the public use. 2. That they must be men who have arrived at twenty years of age ; for
women , and men under that age, were not permitted to dispose by will of more than one medimn of barley.2
3. That they must not be adopted ; for when adopted persons die with out issue, the estates they received by adoption return to the relations of the man who had adopted them . 4. That they should have no male children of their own , for then their
estates belonged to them . If they had daughters only , the persons to whom the inheritance was bequeathed were obliged to marry them.3 Yet men were allowed to appoint heirs to succeed their children, in case these happened to die under twenty years of age .
5. That they should be in their right minds, because testaments extorted in the frenzy of a disease, or in the dotage of old age, were not in reality the wills of the persons that made them . 6. That they should not be under imprisonment or other constraint, their consent being then only forced, nor in justice to be reputed voluntary.
7. That they should not be induced to it by the charms and insinuations of a wife ; for, says Plutarch, the wise lawgiver, with good reason , thought that no difference was to be put between deceit and necessity , flattery and
compulsion , since both are equally powerful to persuade a man from reason. Wills were usually, signed before several witnesses, who put seals to them for confirmation, and were then placed in the hands of trustees,
called lassantai, who were obliged to see them performed. At Athens, some of the magistrates, particularly the astynomi, were often present at the making of wills . Sometimes the archons were also present. When
any thing was given in the presence of the archons, it was termed dóois :6 for this word, though commonly taken for any sort of gift or present, was
by the Athenian orators peculiarly applied to legacies, and things dis

και κατά διάθεσιν, by gift and will , is opposed to succession κατά γένος, by natural right. Sometimes the testator declared his will before sufficient witnesses, without committing it to writing. Thus Callias, fearing to be cut off by a wicked conspiracy, is said to have made an open declaration of his will before the popular assembly at Athens. The same was done in the nuncupative wills at Rome.
There are several copies of wills in Diogenes Laërtius, as those of Aristotle, Lycon, and Theophrastus ; from which it appears they had a
common form , beginning with a wish for life and health ; afterwards add ing, that in case it happened otherwise, their will was as followed , in this
manner : " Έσται μεν εύ , εάν δέ τι συμβή, ταύτα διατίθεμεν, &c.

Men's vices and dishonourable actions were likewise participated by
their children ; for it was thought no more than reasonable that those who share in the prosperity and good fortune of their parents should partake likewise of their losses and miscarriages. Agamemnon in Homer could
be prevailed on by no arguments to spare the sons of Antimachus, their father having endeavoured to procure the death of Menelaus and Ulysses when they were sent on an embassy to Troy :4

There are many other instances to the same purpose ; hence it appears this practice was not owing to the passions and prejudices of particular persons, but was thought agreeable to justice and reason . It may be sufficient in this place to mention the famous Macedonian law , by which it was ordered, that men guilty of conspiring against their king should not only suffer death , with their children, but that all those who were
nearly allied to them should share in the same punishment; hence we find, that when Philotas was found guilty of treason against Alexander, of the noblemen and others related to him, some stabbed themselves, and
others fled into wildernesses and deserts, till the king issued his pardon for them,
It remains that I add something concerning the returns of gratitude due from children to their parents, which appear from their assiduous attendance on them in the lowest offices ; whence one in Aristophanes relates how his daughter washed and anointed his feet : 2 -- και πρώτα μεν η θυγάτηρ First, my dear child did wash her father's feet, 'Arority, kai tà trú8 ådsløg, kai # porúfasa pianos. Then she anointed them, and bending down, Gave them a sweet endearing kiss.
They were zealous in vindicating the honour, and revenging the injuries of their parents: hence Telemachus in Homer says, Orestes had gained
the applause of all Greece, and recommended his name to succeeding ages, by taking revenge on his father's murderers.3
Several other instances might be produced , wherein children showed their gratitude to their parents, of which I shall only mention their care in providing a comfortable subsistence for their old age (to do which was
termed yngoßoortiv ), and in performing their funeral rites. So concerned were they about these things, that when they undertook any hazardous enterprise, it was customary to engage some of their friends to maintain
and protect their aged parents. Thus, when the Thebans living in exile
at Athens conspired' to free their native country from the Tyrants whom the Lacedæmonians had imposed on it, they divided themselves into two
companies, and agreed that one should endeavour to get into the city , and surprise the enemy, whilst the other remaining behind in Attica, should await the issue, and provide for the parents and children of their asso
ciates, if they perished in the attempt. And thus Euryalus, in Virgil, when going to expose his life to danger, passionately entreats Ascanius to comfort and make provision for his mother.6

behaviour of children to their parents as one of the greatest, and which called to heaven for vengeance :
No crime was thought to be followed with more certain and inevitable judgments than this ; for the Furies and other infernal deities were be
lieved always ready to execute the curse of parents injured by their chil dren ; hence Telemachus in Homer refuses to force his mother Penelope
from his house, for fear of being haunted by the Furies and reproached by

Phænix was punished with barrermess when his father invoked the assistance of the Furies against him :3
Many other instances occur in authors, as those of Edipus, Theseus,
and others produced by Plato,4 where he endeavours to prove that the
gods were always prepared to hear the prayers and revenge the injuries of parents. Nor was the punishment of this crime only left to be exe
cuted by the gods, but frequently inflicted by human appointment. Solon ordered all persons who refused to make due provision for their parents to be punished with scripía, ignominy.5 The same penalty was incurred by those who beat their parents. Neither was this confined to their im
mediate parents, but equally understood of their grandfathers, grand mothers, and other progenitors.
When persons admitted to appear for the office of archon were ex amined concerning their life and behaviour, one of the first questions
proposed was , whether they had honoured their parents ; if they were found faulty in this respect, their suit was rejected. Yet there were some cases in which that lawgiver excused children
from maintaining their parents, as when they had been bred up to no calling or profession, by which they might be enabled to subsist in the world ; for the care and trouble of parents in educating their children
being the main foundation of those duties they were to expect from them , their default herein was thought to absolve the children from their alle giance. In like manner, such as were prostituted by their parents were not compelled to maintain them . The sons of harlots were also declared to lie under no obligation of relieving their fathers, because they who
keep company with harlots are not supposed to design the procreation of children , but their own pleasure, and therefore have no pretence to up braid those with ingratitude, whose very birth they made a scandal and reproach to them ?
As the unkindness of parents was made a sufficient excuse for children

to deny them relief in their old age, so the disobedience or extravagance of children, whether natural or adopted,' frequently deprived them of the care and estate of their parents ; yet the Athenian lawgiver did not allow fathers to disinherit their children from passion, or slight prejudice, but
required their appearance before certain judges appointed to take cogni zance of such matters, where, if the children were found to deserve so
severe a sentence, the public crier was ordered to proclaim , that such a
person rejected the criminal, whose name was then repeated, from being
his son ; hence , to disinherit a son is called åtoxneúžas sòv viòv, and the person so disinherited αποκήρυκτος.2? To be disinherited was likewise
called εκπίπτειν του γένους , to be received again , αναλαμβάνεσθαι εις το γένος.. It may be farther observed , that parents were allowed to be re
conciled to their children , but after that could never abdicate them again , lest απέραντοι των παιδιών αι τιμωρίαι, και φόβος αΐδιος, the punishments of
children should become endless, and their fears perpetual.3 When any man , either through dotage or other infirmity, became unfit to manage his estate, his son was allowed to impeach him before the ( ogátoges) men of his own ward , who had power to invest the son with
the immediate possession of his inheritance. There is an allusion to this law in Aristophanes, who has introduced the son of Strepsiades exclaiming :* οι μου , τι οράσω παραφρονούντος του πατρόςκαι What course pursue with one, whose reason war Πότερον παρανοίας αυτόν εισαγαγών όλω ; Out of all course ? Shall I take out the statute, How shall I deal with this old crazy father ?
And there is a remarkable story concerning Sophocles, who being accused by Iophon and his other sons, of neglecting his affairs through dotage,
read to the judges his tragedy called Edipus Coloneus, which he had then lately composed, and was acquitted.5

The times of eating, according to Athenæus,l were four every day. 1 . 'Axpériopce, the morning meal, so termod because it was customary at this (ime to eat pieces of bread dipped in wine unmixed with water, which in
Greek is called örgæter. This meal, which was taken about the rising of the sun , is by Homer called girtov, either árò to úsígay, from its being first taken away ; or rather år) Toũ hgrotāv, because the heroes immediately went to the war from this meal, and there valiantly behaved themselves. ? Sometimes it was termed davnotionós, jentaculum , breakfast. 2. Arīsvon, so named because after this meal dtí rovsīv, it was usual to return to the
war, or other labours: whence it is sometimes synonymous with ägotov, being taken for the morning meal, as Athenæus hath observed from the
following verse of Homer, in which the heroes are said to put on their armour after the dsītroy.
Ο δ' άρα δείπνον έλοντ' , από δ' αυτού θωρήσσοντο.
3. Asasvòv, sometimes also termed torégioua, the afternoon meal. 4 . Aéros, the supper, (which afterwards among the later Greeks was termed
δείπνον,) s0 named from ιαύερσος, that meal being eaten όταν εις το ιαύειν Fogsvápesta, the last before we go to sleep. Philemon , as he is cited by
Athenæus, thus enumerates the times of eating : 1. ' Axpériodic . 2. "Agio

δειλινόν, or εσπέρισμα, a distinct meal from the δόρπος , seem to have had no better foundation for that distinction than that verse of Homer,

frugal and temperate. It was thought sufficient if they had a moderate breakfast, and after the business and labour of the day, refreshed themselves with a plentiful meal. Hence Plato wondered that the Sicilians and Ita
lians should eat two plentiful meals every day ; and amongst the Greeks it was accounted extravagance to breakfast or dine to the full; neither was it thought convenient by Cicero the Roman ,l bis in die saturum fieri,
twice a -day to eat to the full ;' and so temperate were the ancient Romans, that viles et rusticos cibos ante ipsosfocos sumpserunt, eosque ipsos capere
nisi ad vesperam non licuit, 2. they lived upon very mean food, and used not to allow themselves that till the evening ;' whence Isidorus,3 explaining the
words cena and vesperna , by which the supper or evening meal is signi
fied , adds, that dinners were not used.
CHAP, XVI .
OF THE SEVERAL SORTS OF ENTERTAINMENTS.
the primitive ages, 4 πάσα συμποσίου συναγωγή την αιτίαν εις θεόν ανέ
Oegs, all meetings ut entertainments were occasioned by their devotion to the gods; neither was it usual either to indulge themselves with the free use of wine or dainties, unless they did it on a religious account ;5 for on
festival days they used to rest from their labours, and to live more plenti fully than at other times, believing that the gods, on such oceasions, were present at their tables,6 -mensæ credere adesse c'eos.
And in consequence of this opinion , τας εορτάς σωφρόνως και κοσμίως διήγoν, they behaved themselves with sobriety and decency at their festival enter
tainments; neither did they drink to excess, but having moderately refreshed themselves, offered a libation to the gods, and then returned home.?
Afterwards, when a freer mode of living was in use , we find mention of
three sorts of entertainments ; είλαπιν , γάμος, and έρανος,
Είλαπίν, δέ γάμος , επεί ουκ έρανος τα δε γ' εστίν. 8
Hence there are commonly said to have been three distinct sorts of enter tainments among the ancient Greeks ; but these may be reduced to two,
sination and égavos, under one of which yógos, the marriage entertainment, may be comprehended . The first of these (siaativn), sometimes termed
ευωχία, and ασύμβολον δείπνον, was an entertainment provided at the ex pense of one man : on the contrary, šparos was an entertaiument made at
the common charge of all present, being so named útò roll oursąv xai puppígur fruotov, because every man contributed his proportion , 9 this

entertainment was sometimes termed lingos. hence the guests, who are more commonly named ερανισται, were called συνθιασώται. The contri
bution of each guest was termed συμφορά, εισφορά, καταβαλά , συμβολή , &c.
hence the entertainment was named δείπνον συμφορητόν, συμβολιμαίον, από our Boañs, rarußórias, and sometimes tò ix zonvoû, &c. At Argos they
called the contribution by a particular name, xão. The persons who col lected the contributions were called by the same name with the guests,
ερανισταί.
Hither may be referred δείπνον συναγώγιμον, mentioned in the Fragments of Alexis, which is by Menander termed auvayárov. Both names are
derived from ouvége, which, by a particular use, signified usz' saanawe civsiy, to drink together. But whether this entertainment was the same
with žgayos is not determined.
Δείπνα επιδόσιμο, or, εξ επιδομάτων, were entertainments in which some
of the guests contributed more than their exact proportion ; to do which is termed επιδιδόναι ..
To this place also must be reduced rò ÚTÒ otupídos , in Latin called e sportulá cena : when any man having provided his own supper, puts it into a basket, and goes to eat it at another man's house , 2 Different from this was the Roman sportula, which was an alms received by clients from their rich patrons, in a basket of that name, of which we have frequent mention in Juvenal, Martial, and the histories of the Roman emperors. This cus
tom is also mentioned by Hesychius, who tells us, that arò orugidos deuson Yī signifies to receive in a basket a piece of silver, or fragments of meat,
instead of a supper. Which explication of that expression , though rather taken from the writers of the Roman than Grecian affairs, gave occa
sion to the mistake of Meursius, who, in his learned Commentary upon
Lycophron , confounds the Grecian onugis with the sportuta of Rome. The čpavo being provided at less expense than other entertainments, in which one person sustained the whole charge, were generally most fre quented, and are recommended by the wise men of those times as most apt to promote friendship and good neighbourhood . They were also for
the most part managed with more order and decency, because the guests who ate of their own collation only were usually more sparing than when
they were feasted at another man's expense. And so different was the behaviour at their public feasts from that at private entertainments, that Minerva in Homer, having seen the intemperance and unseemly actions
of Penelope's courtiers, concludes their entertainment was not igaros, pro vided at the common charge, but sinativ, or gámos, and furnished at the expense of a single person .” They who were present without contributing towards the entertainment
were termed doumbohon in which condition were poets and singers, and

others who made diversion for the company ; hence that saying of Anti
phanes . "Ακαπνα γαρ αεί αοιδοί θύομεν. We singers always feast without smoke.
For @rayve Jóa , to feast or kill without smoke, is a proverbial phrase for
such as partake of entertainments without the charge and trouble of pro viding them ; whence in Leonides's epigram to Cæsar, there was this ex
pression : Καλλιόπης γαρ άκαπνον αεί θύος.. Calliope always kills without smoke.
By which is meant, that the Muses and their favourites are always en
tertained at other men's expense ; hence also dobußodos is sometimes taken for a useless person who is maintained by other men, and contributes
nothing towardsthe charge ; as, for example, in Plutarch,2 where he relates the celebrated fable of Menenius Agrippa, in which the rest of the mem
bers are said to accuse the belly, ως μόνης αργού και ασυμβόλου καθεζομένου, that when they all had some use or employment, she alone remained idle and contributed nothing to the common service.
It must not be omitted, that there were in many places public entertain
ments, at which a whole city, or a tribe, or any other body or fraternity of men were present ; these were termed by the general names ouroitia ,
Favdaíoices, &c., or sometimes from the body of men who were admitted , δημοθoινίαι, δείπνα δημόσια, and δημοτικά, φρατρικά , φυλετικά , &c . , accord ing as those of the same borough (oñuos), fraternity, (peargia ), or tribe, (quan), met together. And the provision was sometimes furnished by contribution, sometimes by the liberality of some of the rich , and some times out of the public revenue . The design of these entertainments,
which , in some places, were appointed by the laws, was to accustom men
to parsimony and frugality, and to promote peace and good neighbourhood . They were first instituted in Italy by king Italus, from whom that country received its name. The next to these, in order of time, were those
appointed by king Minos in Crete, after whose example Lycurgus insti tuted the public entertainments at Sparta, though the name was varied ; for 4 the Cretans termed their Syssitia, or public entertainments, évègsła,
and the Lacedæmonians, Pudíric yet this difference was not primitive, if we may believe Aristotle, who affirms that anciently the Lacedæmonians
did not use the name of Quiditia, but that of avdosid, which was the Cre tan word . These entertainments were managed with the utmost frugality, and persons of all ages were admitted, the young being obliged by the
lawgiver to repair hither, as to didvoransive owogorúuns, schools of temper ance and sobriety, where, by the example and discourse of the more aged, which was generally instructive , they were trained to good manners and useful knowledge. The Athenians had likewise their Syssitia, particu larly that in which the senate of five hundred, together with such as, for the public services, or the eminent, merit of themselves or their ancestors,

were thought worthy of this honour, were entertained at the public expense : many others, both at Athens and in other places, are mentioned by the Greek authors.
CHAP . XVIII,
OF THE MATERIALS OF WHICH ENTERTAINMENTS CONSISTED,
In the primitive times, men lived on such fruits as sprung out of the earth
without art or cultivation , and desired no sort of drink but that which the fountains and rivers afforded. Ælian , describing the most ancient food of
several nations, reports that at Argos they fed chiefly upon pears, at Athens upon figs, in Arcadia upon acorns ; and so celebrated were the Arcadians
for living upon that sort of diet, that they are distinguished by the name of Bercenpáryos, acorn -eaters. Most of the other nations of Greece also made use of acorns. Hence it was customary at Athens, when they kept their
marriage festivals, for a boy to bring in a bough full of acorns, and a plate covered with bread , proclaiming, " Epuzov ruxòv, es por cuessvov, I have escap ed the worse, and found the better ; which was done in memory of their leaving the use of acorns for- that of bread. At Rome, also, the corona civica was composed 4 of oak -leaves, because that tree afforded the most ancient food ; for the same reason, some of the trees which bear acorns
were termed in Greek páros, from pázsiv, to eat, and in Latin esculi, from esca , food ;5 and, as Macrobius 6 has observed , “ Ancient authors have
either delivered upon their knowledge, or feigned, that in the first ages,
men lived upon acorns and berries, and were for a long time unacquainted with the art of ploughing the earth for corn ; ” nevertheless they believed
that in the golden age, when men enjoyed all sorts of plenty and prospe rity, the earth produced corn without cultivation . But this age being expired, the earth, as they imagined, became unfruitful, and men falling into extreme ignorance and barbarity, lived 8 not unlike to brute beasts, till Ceres taught them the art of sowing, and several other useful inven tions, the memory of which was celebrated many ages after on their festival
days. The first whom Ceres taught to sow and till the ground was Trip tolemus, by whom that knowledge was communicated to his countrymen , the Athenians. Afterwards, she imparted the same art to Eumelus, a citi
zen of Patræ in Achaia, by whom it was first introduced into that country , as it was also by Arcas into Arcadia.9 Some farther state that the invention of making and baking bread is due to Pan. We must not omit to mention
that barley was used before any other sort of corn ; for it is reported that

this was the first food which the gods imparted to mankind ;1 and that it was the most ancient sort of victual, appears both from the custom of the
Athenians mentioned by Menander, and from the name of those gladiators who are called hordearii, from the Latin name of barley. But in more
civilized ages, barley bread came to be the food of beasts, and of the poor, who were not able to furnish their tables with better provision. In the
Roman camp,3 soldiers who had been guilty of any offence, were fed with
barley instead of bread-corn ; as, for example, in the second Punic war, where the cohorts which lost their standards had an allowance of barley assigued them by Marcellus.4 Augustus Cæsar commonly punished the
cohorts which gave ground to the enemy, by a decimation, and allowing them no provision but barley.5 The first ages of men wholly abstained from flesh , 6 from an opinion that it was unlawful to eat, or to pollute the altars of the gods with the blood of living creatures. Swine were used for food first of all animals,
being wholly upserviceable for all other purposes, and having, in the lan
guage of Cicero,” animam pro sale ne putrescant, “ lives only , instead of salt, to keep them from putrefying. On the contrary, for several ages
after flesh came to be eaten , it was thought unlawful to kill oxen , because they are very serviceable to mankind , and partners of their labour in cul
tivating the ground.8 It was also unusual to kill young animals (hence Priam is introduced by Homer reproving his sons for feasting upon young
lambs), either because it savoured of cruelty to deprive those of life that had scarce tasted the joys of it, or that it tended to the destruction of the species ; whence, at a time when sheep were scarce at Athens, there was
a law enacted to forbid &Téxtov degròs gausoties, the eating of lambs which had never been shorn . Neither did the ancients seek for dainties or
rarities, but were content with sheep, goats, swine, oxen , (when it was become lawful to kill them ,) what they caught in hunting, and what was most easy to be provided, and afforded the most healthful nourishment. Hence all the Greeks in Homer live upon a simple diet ; young and old ,
kings and private men , are contented with the same provision. Aga memnon entertains Ajax, after his combat with Hector, with the chine
of an ox, as a reward of his valour. Alcinous, king of Phæacia, who
affected a more splendid and delicate way of living, feeds upon beef. Menelaus sets before Telemachus a chine of beef at the marriage -feast of
his son. And the courtiers of Penelope, though given to all sorts of pleasure, are never entertained with either fish or fowl, or any delicacies.
This has been observed by Athenæus ; 9 who has likewise remarked , that Homer's heroes neither boil their meat nor dress it with sauces, but only
roast it. This was in most places the ancient way of dressing meat: hence Servius also affirms,10 that in the heroic ages they did not eat

boiled flesh , and that among the Romans the primitive diet was roast, then boiled , and last of all broths came into use . Nevertheless, as Athe
næus has elsewhere taken notice, even in Homer's time boiled meat was
sometimes provided ; which appears both from that entertainment in the Odyssey, where an ox's foot is thrown at Ulysses ; it being well known that ( in that author's words) no man ever roasts an ox's foot ; and also
from the express words of the 21st Iliad :1 "Ως δε λέβης ζει ένδον επειγόμενος περι παλλό, Κνίσσομελούμενος απαλοτροφέος σιαλοοο .
This was the mode of living among the ancient Greeks; the Lacedæ
monians of later ages were not less temperate than their ancestors, so
long as they observed the laws of Lycurgus. They had their constant diet at the ouosítı , or public entertainments, wherein the food was ex tremely simple, of which each person had a certain proportion allotted .
The chief part of the provision was péaces Sweeds, the black broth , peculiar to that nation, which was so unpleasant that a citizen of Sybaris happening once to be entertained at Sparta, cried out, that he no longer wondered why the Lacedæmonians were the most valiant soldiers in the world, when any man in his sound mind would rather die a thousand times than Jive on such vile food . " And it is reported that Agesilaus distributed
certain sweetmeats, which had been presented to him by the Thasians, amongst the slaves, saying, that the servants of virtue ought not to in dulge themselves with such delicacies, it being unworthy of men of free birth to share those pleasures by which slaves are allured .' For this rea son the cooks of Lacedæmon were only dressers of flesh , and they who understood any thing farther in the art of cookery were banished from Sparta , as the filth of men, infected with the plague.'3 Hence Mithæcus, a very eminent cook , designing to follow his profession in that city , was immediately commanded by the magistrates to depart. This custom was not unlike that of the ancient heroes, who kept no cooks, but some times dressed their own provisions.5 τάμνυν δ' άρα δίoς 'Αχιλλεύς , Achilles at the genial feast presides, Kai sà per að miorudis, kai åpg' oBeAviou (trips.

Sicilians were so remarkable for their luxurious way of living, that Exxs
aoxn zpárosa, a Sicilian table, was a proverbial phrase for one furnished very profusely and luxuriously.3 Next to the Lacedæmonian tables, those of Athens are said to have
been furnished most frugally, the Athenian soil being unfruitful, and un
able to supply more provision than was just necessary for the support of its inhabitants. Hence Lynceus the Samian is cited by Athenæus for
contemning the Athenian entertainments : 4
Μάγεις', ο θύων ο δειπνίζων τ' εμέ, Ρόδιος : εγώ δ' ο κεκλημένος , Περίνθιος " Ουδέτερος ημών ήδεται τοϊς Αττικούς Δείπνοις " αηδία γάρ έστιν Αττική.
And the same author goes on in his description of the meanness of the provisions at Athens, which were so exceedingly parsimonious, that Dro meas, an Athenian parasite, being asked whether the suppers at Athens
or those at Chalcis were more magnificent ? replied, that the fpoolusor, first course, at Chalcis was preferable to the whole entertainment at Athens. Hence to live 'Attixnews, like an Athenian , is to live penuri .

the general drink , with which they were supplied from the nearest foun
tain . Afterwards hot fountains came into request, from the example of Hercules, who being very much fatigued with labour, refreshed himself
at a hot fountain, which, as fables tell us, was discovered to him by Minerva or Vulcan ; and this sort of water was thought extremely bene ficial on similar occasions. Hence Plato commends his Atlantic island ,
which he describes to be the most delightful country in the world , on account of its hot as well as cold fountains; and Homer relates that one of the fountains of the river Scamander was exquisitely cold , and the other hot ; yet it will be difficult to infer from Homer that hot waters were drunk in the heroic ages ;3 they seem only to have been used for bathing,
unless prescribed by the physicians, as was usually done to old men, and others who had weak stomachs. Certain, however, it is that, at least in later ages, hot waters were in request amongst the Greeks, and from them came to be used at Rome ; hence the Roman authors mention the use of them as a Grecian custom.4
Quo Chium pretio cadum Mercemur ? quis aquam temperet ignibus ?
Where Acron explains temperet by tepefaciat ; nam tepefactis aquis sole bant Græci vinum temperare : ‘ for the Greeks,' says he, used to temper their wine with warm water . "
But there is more frequent mention of cold water than of hot, both in the Greek and Roman authors ; and in order to drink it exquisitely cold,
it was customary to temper it with ice, which they had several methods of preserving through all the heat of summer : Plutarch 6 relates that it
was usual to wrap it in cloths and straw ; hence St Augustine asks,

The invention of wine was ascribed by the Egyptians to Osiris, by the Latins to Saturn , and by the Greeks to Bacchus, to whom divine honours were paid on that account. It is reported by Hecatæus the Milesian ,
that the use of wine was first discovered in Ætolia, by Orestheus the son of Deucalion , whose grandson Eneus, the father of Ætolus, from whom

sary to human bodies, that they invented a sort of wine, made of barley,
for the poorer sort, who wanted money to purchase that which was pressed from grapes.2
In Greece, the matrons and virgins drank wine, as appears from the examples of Nausicaë and her companions in Homer.3 And because the
same freedom was rarely allowed that sex in other countries, the Grecian women were ill thought of on that account.4 It was likewise customary
to give it to children, unless the management of Achilles was different from that of other infants.5

Nevertheless, most of the Greeks, and particularly the Lacedæmonians,
sometimes expatiotipov privers, drank wine with little or no water, which they termed intorubious, to act like a Scythian ; for the Scythians were very much addicted to drunkenness, and used wine without water ; hence
άκρατοπιείν is commonly termed σκυθιστι πιείν, or σκυθοπιεϊν " and άκρα τοποσία is called Σκυθική πόσις: these expressions came into vogue at Sparta from the time that Cleomenes the Spartan , by living and convers
ing with the Scythians, learned to drink to excess and madness. The Thracians also drank their wine unmixed with water ; and both they and
the Scythians were generally such lovers of it, that the women and all the
men thought it a most happy life to fill themselves with unmixed wine, and to pour it upon their garments.9 Hence also by Θρακία πρόποσις, the

vocatores, and by the Greeks naáreges, or dutyoxańcopes. They were also, though not so frequently, called incargo and lauatgoi, from lasos, the name of the table on which the provision was placed in the kitchen . Thus éasatpol, according to Pamphilus in Athenæus,' are they who
invite to the king's table.' Sometimes to invite was termed karaygá Quv, to write down, from the custom of inscribing the names of the per sons to be invited upon a tablet. The hour was signified at the invita
tion ; and because they then numbered the hours by the motion of the sun , there is frequent mention, on these occasions, of oxià , the shadow of
the sun, and of otozesios, the letter of the dial.2 Relations often went without invitation , as hath been observed 3 from that verse of Homer where he describes an entertainment at Agamemnon's tent :4
Αυτόματος δε οι ήλθε βοήν άγαθος Μενέλαος.,
Valiant Menelaus came to him αυτόματος, that is, άνευ του κληθήναι ,
without being invited. Such as were brought without invitation to the entertainment by some of those who had been invited,5 were termed oxiai,
shades, from their following the principal guests, as shadows do bodies. The same persons were by the Romans called umbræ ,6
They who forced themselves into other men's entertainments were in Greek called revices, in Latin muscæ , flies, which was a general name of reproach for such as insinuated themselves into any company where they
were not welcome : thus the parasite is described by Antiphanes:
Θύρας μοχλεύειν, σεισμός είσπηδάν ακρίς: Δειπνείν άκλητος, μυϊκ μη εξελθείν, φρέαρ.
In Plautus,7 an entertainment free from unwelcome guests is called hospitium sine muscis, “ an entertainment without flies; and an inquisitive and busy man, who pries and insinuates himself into the secrets of others,
musca.8 In Egypt, a fly was the hieroglyphic of an impudent man, be cause that insect, being beaten away, still returns again ;9 on which ac count it is by Homer made an emblem of courage.

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE . 6ST
those who, by flattery and other mean arts, used to insinuate themselves
to the tables of other men ; in which sense it was first used by Epichar mus, and afterwards by Alexis :1 nevertheless, it was common for friends and men of credit to visit one another's houses at the times of entertain
ment, without expecting a formal invitation , as appears from that saying cited by Eustathius: 2
'Aκλήτοι κωμάζουσιν είς φίλους φίλοι,
And that other in Plato :3
εις άρα και αγαθών επί δαιτα; ίασιν Αυτόματοι αγαθοί ..
Which is sometimes thus cited in one hexameter verse :
Αυτόματοι δ' αγαθού άγαθών επί δαιτας εσιν.
The number of guests was unlimited : some chose to invite three, or
four, or five at the most. Among the ancients it was not usual for more than five to sup together.5 In after times the numbers were indefinite. In the overitia, or common meals, not above ten were admitted ; which, in
the opinion of some, was the ordinary number of guests at entertainments in the primitive times; and hence they think it is, that when Agamem non in Homer 6 speaks of distributing the Grecian army at an entertain ment, he mentions only dexádes, tens. But this must only be understood
of the entertainments of private men. Princes often invited greater num bers ; Agamemnon in Homer entertains all the Grecian princes together ;
and Alexander the Macedonian is reported, before his expedition against Persia , to have furnished a tent with 100 beds for an entertainment.? And
the same vanity by degrees crept in amongst private men , insomuch that
in the time of Athenæus, apparócio, infinite numbers, were invited . Hence, partly to prevent tumult and sedition, and partly to restrain the expensiveness and prodigality of their citizens, some lawgivers thought it necessary to limit the number of guests ; at Athens in particular no per son was allowed to entertain above thirty at once . In order to put this
statute in execution, certain magistrates, called Turainovópon, were obliged to go to entertainments, and to expel thence such as exceeded that
number ; and the cooks who were commonly employed to dress the victuals at entertainments were obliged to give in their names every time they were hired.8
It must farther be observed concerning the guests, that men and women were never invited together. In this respect the Greeks differed from the Romans, amongst whom the women were allowed more freedom : " for
what Roman ,' to use the words of Cornelius Nepos, was ever ashamed to bring his wife to an entertainment ? And what mistress of a family can

he shown, who does not inhabit the chief and most frequented part of the house ? whereas in Greece she never appears at any entertainment except
those to which none but relations are invited, and constantly lives in the
innermost part of the house, which is called yuvaixwvītis, the women's apart ment, into which po man, except near relations, has admission. Before they went to an entertainment, they washed and anointed them selves, for it was thought very indecent to go thither defiled with sweat
and dust. They who came off a journey were washed and clothed with apparel suitable to the occasion, in the house of the entertainer, before they were admitted to the feast ; thus we find in Homer, where he describes the reception of Telemachus and Pisistratus by Menelaus : 3
"Ες ρ' οσαμίνθους βάντες εξέστους λουσαντο ' Thence to the bath, a beauteous pile, descend : Τους δ' επεί ούν όμωαι λούσαν, και χρισαν ελαίω, Where a bright damsel-train attend the guests 'Αμφί δ' άρα χλαίνας ούλας βάλον ήδε χιτώνας, With liquid odours, and embroider'd vests. "Ες ρα θρόνους έζoντo παρ' 'Ατρείδην Μενέλαον. Refresh'd , they wait them to the bower of state, From room to room their eager view they bend ; Where circled with his peers Atrides sate . POPE.
The same persons also washed their hands before they sat down to meat.4
It was also customary to wash between every course, and after supper. Hence Homer introduces his heroes δειπνούντας, ομιλούντας , είτα απονιψα
peévous Fonsi ráan duit voorras, supping, conversing, then washing, and after
that again supping ; and Aristophanes speaks of bringing üdwe xarà xsipos Mità tarifus, water to wash the hands after the courses . By those who
spoke accurately, to wash the hands before supper was termed vikaolu , to wash after supper, kroví baoba.. Hither are to be referred the words απομάξασθαι, εναπομάξασθαι , άποψήσαι, and the like , which signify to wipe
the hands. The towel was termed éxpaycior, xsegóvaxtgav, &c., instead of which the ancient Greeks used åfojiceydanícs, which were the soft and fine part of the bread, which afterwards they cast to the dogs, hence áro μαγδαλίαis by the Lacedaemonians called κυνάς..
It is farther to be observed, that in the washing after supper they used some sort of ouñyua kropúxews répov, stuff to scour the hands ;6 for which
use nitre and hyssop are mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. Lastly, upon washing, the hands were perfumed with odours.
It may not be improper in this place to add something farther, by way of digression , concerning the custom of washing and anointing, which in Greece and other hot countries,was so frequent. To wash is upodstixor μεν ρυπού, αναψυχής δέ τινος αίτιον , α means both to cleanse the body from
filth and refresh it ;; whenever therefore they ceased from sorrow and
mourning, it was usual to bathe and anoint themselves : whence Eurynome in Homer advises Penelope to leave off lamenting :?
Χρώτ ' ασονιψαμένη , και επιχρίσουσα παρειάς ,
washing her body and anointing her fače. The ancient Greeks com

lemachus and Pisistratus are bathed and anointed at the palace of Mene laus, after a long journey ; Diomedes and Ulysses, after their return from
discovering the manner of their enemies' encampment, ' having bathed and anointed , sat down to supper.' In the heroic ages, men and women, without distinction bathed themselves in rivers ; this we find done by
Nausicaë, the daughter of Alcinous, king of Phæacia ;? and Europa, in Moschus,2 cleanses her body in the mouth of Anaurus. Helen also and her companions wash in the river Eurotas,3

whence kokerbos is mentioned by Pollux amongst the vessels which belong to balneos ; and the ancient Romans had a ves

when two baths came to be used,

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 685
Athenæus tells us that in his age, they were but lately come into use, and
thatformerly no such places were allowed to be within the city.
The baths commonly contained the following rooms : 1. 'Αποδυτήριον, in which απεδύοντο τα μάτια, they put of their clothes. 2. 'Tróxaustov, or rupicctágios, the sweating room , most commonly round , and provided with üp öxarvoy, fire so contrived that it should not smoke, for the benefit of those who desired to sweat; it was also termed Laconicum ,
from the frequent use of this mode of sweating in Laconia .
3. Bartoothgov, a hot bath .
4. Aourgày a cold bath . 5. 'Aurthgrow, the room in which they were anointed.
After bathing they always anointed , either to close the pores of the body, which was especially necessary after the use of hot baths, or to prevent the
skin from becoming rough after the water was dried off it. If we may believe Pliny,3 they had no better ointment in the time of the Trojan'war
than oil perfumed with odoriferous herbs, especially with roses ; whence padósy frasov, oil mixed with roses, is mentioned in Homer's twenty - third Iliad ,4 where Venus anoints the body of Hector :
-ροδόεντι δε χαρίεν ελαίω ' Αμβροσία
To the same ointments he elsewhere gives the epithets of depeßgónicy, εδανόν, and σεβυωμένου, 5 speaking of Juno :

smell of oil, which was used in the schools of exercise. Solon prohibited
men from selling ointments ; and the laws of Sparta entirely forbade any person to sell them ; nevertheless, women , and some effeminate men,
were so curious in their choice of ointments, that they could tell very critically what sort suited best with each member of the body ; an example of this we will find in the following verses of Antiphanes, which are cited by Athenæus: 'Εκ χρυσοκολλήτου δε κάλπιδος μύρω Αίγυπτίω μεν τους πόδας και τα σκέλη,, Φοινικίνω δε τους γνάθους και τα τιτθέα,, Σισυμβαίνω δε τον έτερον βραχίονα,, ' Αμαρακίνω δε τας οφρύς και την κόμην, “Ερπυλλίνω δε το γόνυ και τον αυχένα.
The feet being most exposed to dust and filth , were oftener washed and
anointed than other parts of the body ; on which account they are by some thought to be called λιπαροι πόδες in Homer.. Women were generally
employed to wash and anoint the feet, both in the heroic and later ages ; it was customary for them to kiss the feet of those to whom they thought
a more than common respect was due ; thus the woman in the gospel kisses the feet of our blessed Saviour, while she anointed them . The same ceremony was performed towards Philoleon by his daughter, as himself
relates in Aristophanes :2
-και
πρώτα
μεν
θυγάτης
με
'Απονίζη και τα πόδ' αλείφη και προσκύψασα φιλήση. The first ceremony after the guests arrived at the house of entertain
ment was the salutation performed by the master of the house, or one appointed in his place ; to do this was termed by the general name of årtálcoles, though this word in its strict sense , signifies to embrace One with arms around , being derived από του άγαν σπάσθαι εις εαυτόν τον
(tipov, fromforcibly drawing another to one's self;3 but the most common
salutation was by the conjunction of their right hands, the right hand being accounted a pledge of fidelity and friendship ; whence Pythagoras advised Min farti šubáade thy değiày, that the right hand should not be given to every man , meaning that all persons were not fit to be made our friends.
This ceremony was very ancient.4 Hence değiouobus is sometimes joined
with korálcobas, and is almost synonymous with it :5 sometimes it is used figuratively for any sort of entertainment or reception . Thus we find
δεξιούσθαι δαισί, δεξιούσθαι τραπέζη, δεξιούσθαι δώροις, δεξιούσθαι χρηστους λόγοις , και έργοις , & c .
Sometimes they kissed the lips, hands, knees, or feet, in salutations, as the person deserved more or less respect. There was a particular sort of kiss, which is called by Suidas xúrpov, by Pollux xúrpa, the pot, when they took the person , like a pot, by both his ears ; this was chiefly practised by

The guests when admitted, did not immediately sit down at the table, which was accounted ill-breeding, but spent some time in viewing and com mending the room and furniture.4

Joseph ordered his brethren to sit according to their ages, the custom of lying at entertainments not having then obtained . But afterwards when
men began to be soft and effeminate, they exchanged their seats for beds, in order to drink with more ease ; yet then , the heroes who drank sitting
were still thought praiseworthy ; and some who accustomed themselves to a primitive and severe mode of living retained the ancient posture. This
was done by the Cynic philosophers.? In Macedonia, no man was allowed to sit at meals till he had killed a
boar without the help of nets. Alexander the Great sometimes adhered
to the ancient practice; and once entertaining 400 commanders, he placed them upon silver seats, covered with purple cloth.4 And in the most
luxurious and efseminate ages, children were sometimes not permitted to lie down, but had seats at the end of their father's beds. In the time of
Tacitus it was the custom for the children of princes, and the rest of the nobility of that age, to sit at their meals in the sight of their relations,5
Hence Suetonius, describing the behaviour of Augustus towards his grand children, says that they always sat at the end of the bed when they supped with him . The same author reports that the emperor Claudius always supped with his children, and some of the noble boys and maids, who according to ancient custom sat at the bottom of the bed. The same place was commonly assigned to men of mean condition , when they were entertained by persons of superior rank ; hence in Plutarch, the rest of

the guests lie down ; only Æsop is placed upon a seat next to Solon. And
Donatus reports,' that Terence being ordered to repeat some part of his comedies to Cæcilius, went to him at the time of supper, and being in mean apparel, was placed upon a seat near the bed ; but after he had recited a few verses was invited to lie down to supper.
The manner of lying at meat was thus: the table was placed in the
middle, round which stood the beds covered with cloth or tapestry, accord ing to the rank of the master of the house : upon these they lay, inclining the superior part of their bodies on their left arms, the lower part being
· stretched out at length, or a little bent; their heads were raised up, and their backs sometimes supported , with pillows. If several persons lay on
the same bed, then the first lay on the uppermost part, with his legs stretched out behind the second person's back ; the head of the second lay below the navel or bosom of the former, his feet being placed behind
the third person's back ; and in like manner the third , fourth, fifth , &c.;
for though it was accounted mean and sordid at Rome to place more than three or four upon one bed, yet, as we are informed by Cicero, 3 the Greeks
used to crowd five, and frequently a greater number, into the same bed. Persons beloved commonly lay in the bosoms of those who loved them ;
thus the beloved disciple in the gospel lies in the bosom of our blessed
Saviour at the celebration of the passover . Thus also Juvenal :5
Cona sedet, gremio jacuit nova nupta mariti. Supper is set; the new married wife lay in the husband's bosom.
At the beginning of the entertainment it was customary to lie flat upon
their bellies, that so their right hand might with more ease reach the table ; but afterwards, when their appetites began to decrease , they reclined on their sides ; in this sense we are to understand the words of Plutarch ,6
έκαστον εν αρχή μεν επί στόμα προνεύειν, αποβλέποντα προς την τράπεζας ύστερον δε μετασχηματίζειν επί βάθος πλάτους την κατάκλησιν , or, as it should be read, xatáxisoiv, that at the beginning every one put his
mouth forward ,looking towards the table ; but afterwards changes the pos
ture of his inclination from depth to breadth . Horace also alludes to this custom . ?
It was customary, from the heroic ages downwards, for the guests to be ranked according to their quality. It is evident that in Homer,8 the chief persons had the uppermost seats at entertainments. Afterwards, at public entertainments, there was óvopaxańowe, nomenclator, a person appointed
to call every guest by name to his proper place. But to determine in what order they sat, and which were accounted the chief places, is more difficult. It seems probable that the heroes sat in long ranks, and that the chief persons were placed at the head of each rank , on both sides of the table,

which is the meaning of the word äugos, uppermost; thus, when Achilles,
entertains the embassadors of Agamemnon , he places himself uppermost in one rank, and Ulysseș, as the principal ambassador, in the other :

Η δ' άρα πάρ Διϊ πατρί καθίζετο, ειξε δ ' ' Αθήνη.
Juno led the opposite rank ; and being the wife and sister of Jupiter,
neither gave place to Thetis nor any other.3 The most honourable places in beds at entertainments were not the same in all nations. In Persia,
the middle place was the chief, and was always assigned to the king, or to the chief guest ; in Greece, the first or nearest to the table ; and
amongst the Heracleotæ , and the Greeks who lived about the Euxine sea, the first place of the middle bed was the most honourable . At Rome, on
the contrary, the last or uppermost place of the middle was preferred be fore any other. But they who affected a more free and easy way of living were not solicitous about places. An example of this we have in Timon , who having invited men of all ranks, citizens, strangers, friends,
and relations, to a splendid entertainment, desired every man to lie down
in that place which pleased him best ; nevertheless, men of proud tempers, even on such occasions, like the Jews, who were on that account reproved by our blessed Saviour, affected to have the chief places ; so it happened at Timon's entertainment, where many of the guests having taken their places, one in very fine apparel, and attended with a numerous retinue, came to the door of the room, viewed all the company, then presently
retired ; and being followed by several of those who were present, and de sired to return , replied there was no fit place left for him . Some dis
posed their guests in such order as they thought most apt to promote good fellowship, placing men of the same years, of the same profession, or temper, next to one another ; or tempering the variety of humours, by
placing men of angry dispositions nearest the meek and gentle, those of silent tempers nearest the talkative: but in things of this nature there
was no certain rule ; every man followed his own fancy ; and it is pro pounded as a problem in Plutarch ,6 whether it was best to assign every man his place, or leave the guests to take the places which happened to them ? It is said have been a very ancient custom at Lacedæmon ,
for the eldest person present to go before the rest to the beds at the com

mon hall, unless the king gave the precedence to another by calling him . first.1
The table was accounted a very sacred thing, by means of which honour was paid to the god of friendship and hospitality . This god was Jupiter, who, from his protection of guests and friends, received the titles
of Ginos and piacos. Hercules also had some care of this affair ; hence
he is called τραπέζιος and επιτραπέζιος " neither were the rest of the gods thought to be wholly unconcerned . It was customary to place the statues of the gods upon the table ; whence Arnobius derides the Gentiles for
consecrating their tables by placing on them salts and images of their gods.' They also offered libations to the gods upon their tables ; hence
Cleodemus in Plutarch calls it ' the altar of the gods of friendship and hospitality.' And according to the saying of Thales, as the destruction of the earth would occasion disorder and confusion in all parts of the uni verse , so the table being taken away, the whole house would presently be dissolved ; the holy fire, and hearth, and entertainment, which are the
chief endearments of life, or rather life itself, would all be destroyed .”+
Hence we may learn why so much veneration was paid to the tables, that to dishonour them by any dishonest or indecent behaviour was thought a very great crime. Complaints against su as perfidiously violated the
regard due to the hospitable tables are very frequent in the poets: thus Cassandra in Lycophron 6 complains of Paris, who stole away Helena, the wife of Menelaus, by whom he had been courteously entertained :
'

Λάξας τράπεζαν, κανακυπώσας θέμιν.
In the heroic ages the tables were made of wood, polished after the best
manner of those times, and the feet were sometimes painted with a
variety of colours : hence the following epithets of tables in Homer, čloth, löžoos, nuevómica, &c. The form was circular, if we may believe Myr leanus,” who reports that the ancient Greeks made their tables, and several other things, spherical, in imitation of the world, which they be lieved to be of that figure. But Eustathius, who is rather to be followed ,
observes, fromseveral passages in Homer, that the tables were not then round, but extended in length ; which figure is more agreeable to what
has been before observed concerning the manner of their sitting in long ranks. The tables in those days were not covered with linen , but only carefully cleansed with wet sponges. Of this custom there are several examples in Homer.8 And later authors speak of the like practice.9 In later ages, the tables of men of inferior rank were commonly sup
ported by three feet, and made of plain and ordinary wood ; but those
which belonged to men of better condition were composed of more costly materials . The most curious sorts of wood were sought, and many times

fetched from foreign countries for this use . They were also adorned with
piates of silver or other metals, and supported by one or more feet, curi ously wrought, and called, after the name of some of the ancient heroes, Atlantes, Telamones, &c. The most common support of these tables was an ivory foot, cut in the form of a lion, a leopard , or some other animal.
Some have thought that in Homer every guest had a distinct table by himself,1 and that the ancients used to eat by themselves ; but as that is not sufficiently proved by the instances which are produced for that end , so, in the following ages, it was certainly accounted more unsociable and
inhuman to eat in that manner, which was nevertheless practised by some of the barbarous nations, and in particular, as Tacitus reports, by the Germans.
Teórica in Greek, and mensa in Latin , are ambiguous words, and signify not only the tables, but also the meat placed upon them.3 Hence,
by retai , deúrspas, agitus agérica, and in Latin by prime, secunda , tertiæ mensæ , are understood the first, second, and third courses of meat. This ambiguity of signification is thought by some to have been occasioned
by the custom then in use, of bringing in and taking away the tables and the meat upon them together ; which opinion is confirmed by the follow ing passage of Alexis in Athenæus :'
'Ως δε την τράπεζας ανθρώπους δύο Φέροντας είσω, ποικίλων παροψίδων

δόρπισμα , επιδορπίσματα, επιφορήματα, επίδειπνα, μεταδόρπια, &e. ; and by the Dorians, who called entertainments aixia and ourairaala, termed
Isaíxasia ,1 This course was furnished with the utmost splendour, espe
cially in ages addicted to luxury ; and hence it was sometimes, by way of eminence, called tpétiga, the course. But in this sort of provision , the
Greeks were very much excelled by the Persians, who used to say , ' that the Greeks leave off eating while they are hungry, because nothing of any value is ever set before them after supper ; and yet if any thing is pro duced they still eat on.'3
Sometimes the three forementioned provisions were called Furn, deu riga, ogíon ogáriš%, the first, second, third course, the spoobusov delavou
being reckoned a part of the supper, and making the first course ; and where there was a great variety of dishes, a paper was delivered to the master of the feast, containing a catalogue of all the dishes which the cook had provided, and this was communicated by him to the guests as occasion required , that each of them might choose what pleased him best.
It is not, however, to be imagined, that the Grecian suppers always con sisted of such a variety of dishes or courses ; whatever might be the custom at the tables of princes, and others of the first rank, the rest were content with meaner provision for their ordinary diet, and in the heroic ages had rarely more than one course, except on the festivals of the
gods, or on other special occasions, when they allowed themselves more freedom.
The ancients had so great a sense of the divine providence, that they thought it unlawful to eat till they had first offered a part of their provi
sion, as a sort of first- fruits to the gods. This custom was so religiously observed in the heroic ages, that Achilles, though disturbed by the am bassadors of Agamemnon at midnight, would not eat till an oblation was offered :)
--- θεοίσι δε θύσαι ανώγει The first fat offerings, to the lanmortals due, Πάτροκλον όν έταιρον, ο δ' εν πυρί βάλλε θνηλάς. Α τηidst the greedy fames Patroclus threw.-POPE.
And Ulysses, in another place of Homer, reports , that in the den of Polyphemus, himself and his fellow -soldiers were not unmindful of this duty.6
In the entertainments of Plato and Xenophon, we find oblations made ; and, to forbear the mention of more examples, the neglect of this duty was accounted a very great impiety , of which none but Epicurus, and others, who worshipped no gods at all, would be guilty? The first of these oblations was always made to Vesta, the chief of the household
gods ; afterwards they worshipped some of the other gods ; and , last of all, offered a libation to Vesta.8 The reason why this goddess had this
honour paid her, was either because she, being protectress of the house,

was , in Cicero's language , rerum custos intimarum , ókeeper of things most concealed from public view ;' or because she, being the same with the earth in the estimation of the people , was the common principle out
of which all bodies are produced, and into which they are again resolved ; or, lastly, this privilege was conferred by Jupiter, for the service done by Vesta in his war against the giants :2 hence came the proverb, ko' ' Errics
ägxsobo , to begin with Vesta ,3 by which was intimated that our domestic concernments ought to be our first and chief care .
During the entertainment, all the guests were appareled in white, or some other cheerful colour ;4
and, to use Cicero's words, Quis unquam cænavit
atratus ? • What person was ever found to sup in black ?' That colour was reserved for times of
mourning. It was also customary to deck them
selves with flowers, or garlands composed of flowers, which were provided by the master of the feast, and
brought in before the second course, or , as some are of opinion, at the beginning of the entertainment.
They not only adorned their heads, necks, and
breasts, but often bestrewed the beds on which they lay, and every part of the room ; but the head was
chiefly regarded . Garlands are by some thought to have been an
invention of Prometheus, who first prescribed the use of them, that men might, by that emblem of his bonds, commemorate the punishment which he had suffered for his kindness to them . To this opinion the following verses of Æschylus seem to allude : 8
Τώ δε ξένω γε στέφανον , αρχαίον στέφος Δεσμών άριστος εκ Προμηθέως λόγου ..
Others say that Janus invented garlands, ships, boats, and the art of coining money ; and hence it was customary, in several cities of Greece,
and also of Italy and Sicily, for the coin to bear on one side the image of two - faced Janus, and on the reverse a boat, a ship, or a garland. Ac cording to Pliny, the first garlands were used by Bacchus, and were
composed of ivy. 10 And in later ages they commonly made use of ivy and amethystus, as preservatives against drunkenness ; hence the latter of them has its name from the privative particle & and pión.11 Festus affirms that the most ancient garlands were made of wool ; with one of this sort the enchantress adorns her cup :12 Στέψον ταν κελίβαν φοινικέω οιός αώτη.. And crown the narrow brim with purple wool.

not certain . They are used by none of Homer's herces, yet the poet himself has several allusions to them ; hence some conclude that garlands
were unknown in the heroic ages, but came into use before Homer's time.1
The flowers and herbs of which garlands were composed were various. In the primitive times, they made no entertainments but upon the festi
vals of the gods ; and then the garlands, hymns, and songs , were such as the gods were thought to delight in. And in later ages, upon the public festival of any god , they seem to have used the particular herb or flower which was sacred to him ; but at other times all sorts were made use of, as the season would allow , or as they were thought most conducive to
pleasure, refreshment,3 or health . Some were very curious in the choice of their garlands, thinking them to have a very great influence upon the bodies of men ; hence Mnestheus and Callimachus, two Greek physicians,
wrote books concerning garlands. I shall only add, that the rose, being dedicated by Cupid to Harpocrates, the god of silence, to engage him to
conceal the lewd actions of Venus, was an emblem of silence ; hence, to
present it or hold it up to any person in discourse, served instead of an admonition that it was time for him to hold his peace ; and at entertain
ments it was customary to place a rose above the table, to signify that what was there spoken should be kept private." The ancient Greeks anointed their heads with some common and ordi
nary sort of ointment,6 thinking by that means to keep themselves cool and temperate, and to prevent fevers, and other mischievous effects pro ceeding from the immoderate use of wine; but afterwards, as it is usual
for men to improve the things which are used out of mere necessity, by the addition of others, which serve for pleasure and luxury, they came to
use precious ointments and perfumes. These, as also the distribution of garlands, and second courses at entertainments, with all the arts of luxury
and effeminacy, were first introduced into Greece by the Ionians, who, by conversing with the Asiatics, were taught to lay aside the primitive plainness of their manners sooner than the other Greeks; hence Ionicus risus and Ionicus motus became proverbial expressions for profuse laughter
and unseemly motions. The chief part to which ointments were applied
was the head ; but other parts of the body had sometimes their share both of ointments and garlands. The breast, in particular, was adorned with garlands, and anointed, as being the seat of the heart, which they thought was refreshed by these applications, as well as the brain.8 . And the room
in which the entertainment was made was sometimes perfumed by burn ing myrrh or frankincense, or with other odours.9
The officers and attendants at entertainments were these which follow :

In the first place , συμποσίαρχος , sometimes called συμποσίου επιμελητής,
τραπεζοκόμος , τραπεζοποιός , και επί της τραπέζης, άρχιτρίκλινος, and alsa tasargòs, & c., was chief manager of the entertainment. This office was
sometimes performed yb the person at whose charge the entertainment was provided, sometimes by another named by him ; sometimes, especially in entertainments provided at the common expense, by a person elected
by lots, or by the suffrages of the guests. Next, and sometimes the same with the former, was the Becordsòs,
otherwise termed otpatnyos, razlagxos, &c. , and in Latin rèx , modim perator , &c. , the king, whose business it was to determine the laws of
good fellowship, and to observe whether every man drank his proportion , whence he was also called oplaapós, the eye : he was commonly appointed
by lot.' The guests were obliged to be in all things conformable to the commands of the Budiheds ; hence Cicero upbraids a certain person, that
" he who never had submitted to the laws of the Roman people, should
yield obedience to the laws of drinking. " And Arrian reports 3 that the king being created by lot, commands in this manner : do you drink , do you fill the glass, do you go, do you come. The chief magistrates were
not exempted from yielding obedience, if the lots gave another the pre eminence ; hence Agesilaus, king of Lacedæmon, being present at an entertainment, was not declared rex till the lots had favoured him, as we
are informed by Plutarch ,4 who reports in the same place, that being asked by the cup -bearer how much wine each guest should drink , he
made this reply : if there is plenty of wine, let every man have what he
calls for ; if not, let every man have an equal share .' Auitgòs, the carver or distributor, was so termed ' TÒ TOű daleobas, from
dividing and distributing to every guest his portion; and hence enter tainments were also called daites. In the primitive times, the master of the feast carved for all his guests ; thus in Homer 6 when Agamemnon's ambassadors were entertained at the table of Achilles : κρέα νεϊμεν 'Αχιλλεύς.
In later times, the same office was executed by some of the chief men at
Sparta, as appears from the example of Lysander, who was deputed to it
by Agesilaus.7 This custom of distributing to every guest his portion was derived by some from the ages in which the Greeks left off their ancient
way of living upon acorns, and learned the use of corn , which being at first very scarce, gave occasion to continual quarrels: hence úroobania,
which originally signified the disorders committed at feasts, became a general name for all sorts of injurious and wicked behaviour. To prevent
these disorders, it was agreed that a person should be named to distribute to every man his portion ; and hence, as some are of opinion, the phrase dais iton, equal entertainment, so frequently occurs in Homer. Those
Achilles distributed the flesh .

to whom particular respect was due were helped to the best parts, and
very often to a larger share than the rest of the guests: thus Eumæus, in Homer's Odyssey, gives vāros, the chine, which they esteemed the chief
part, to Ulysses ; the same is given by Agamemnon to Ajax 'as a reward for his service in the war. Sarpedon , one of the Lycian kings, in the
same poet, is honoured , " Eden Ti, xpécoin te, idè nasions derásodiv, with the first seat, the best share of meat, and full cups. In another place, Dio
medes κρέασι και πλείοις δεπάεσσι δεξιούται, is entertained with the best
share of the meat and full cups. It appears from Herodotus that the
kings of Sparta had dir háoru reyte , a double portion of every dish . And in the sacred writings the mess of Benjamin , the beloved brother of Joseph , was five times as large as any of the other messes. They who received this honour ' had the privilege of gratifying whomsoever they
pleased with a part of their portion , as was done by Ulysses, who carved a part of the chine which was set before him to Demodocus.' After wards, when Greece learned the arts of luxury, the primitive way of
dividing to every man his portion was laid aside, “as covetous and illi
beral,' and the guests were allowed to carve for themselves in the manner
which pleased them best ;4 nevertheless the ancient custom was retained a long time at the entertainments after sacrifices, and by some who pre
ferred the primitive temperance and frugality to the modern profuse way of living. And Plutarch, in his discourse on the question , · Whether the
ancient Greeks, who allotted to every man his portion , or the modern , who set their provision in common before all the guests, were more to be commended ?' informs us, that the entertainments were conducted with
greater decency , and fewer disorders committed, so long as every man had his portion allotted him.5 The persons employed to distribute drink were commonly termed oivo
xóo , and about the Hellespont émeyxúrai . 6 In the entertainments of the
heroic ages the xágures, heralds, commonly performed this office.? Mer cury, the herald of the gods, is said to be introduced by Alcæus and Sappho, filling the goblets at the celestial entertainments ;8 and it is very
well known that the xhgures were deputed to all sorts of ministrations. It was customary for boys or young men to fill the cups :9
Κούροι μεν κρητήρας έπεστέψαντο ποτοίο ..
Ancient authors affirm that the wine used to be filled about by virgins ;10
and this is agreeable to the manners of those times, in which the guests were attended by virgins without any suspicion of lust or immodesty ;
hence the daughter of Cocalus, king of Sicily, is said to have washed Minos, king of Crete ; and the same is done by other virgins and women in several parts of Homer.l1 So common was it in the primitive times

for young persons of both sexes to be employed in all kinds of ministra tions, that doúros, servants, came to be termed by the names of raides vai Fandíoxas, boys and girls, because persons of that age were commonly employed to serve.1 Nor was this done only by children of mean fortune
or birth ; but, in the primitive times, those of the highest rank filled out
wine, as we find done by Menelaus's son in the following verse of Homer :2
Ωνοχόει
δ
'
υιός
Μενελάου
κυδαλίμοιο
..
The
same
custom
was
,
in
later
and
more
refined
ages
,
still
retained
at
the
entertainments
in
the
temples
,
where
many
of
the
ancient
practices
were
observed
long
after
they
had
been
laid
aside
in
other
places
.
At
the
public
sacrifices
of
the
Æolians
,
in
particular
,
care
was
taken
that
boys
of
the
highest
rank
should
perform
this
office
;
this
was
also
the
practice
at
Rome
,
where
they
used
in
all
things
to
imitate
the
Æolians
,
even
to
the
very
tone
of
their
voice
.
Hence
,
perhaps
,
arose
the
opinion
that
the
custom
of
employing
young
persons
of
liberal
birth
and
education
to
fill
the
wine
was
derived
from
the
sacrifices
of
the
gods
,
at
which
no
slave
was
permitted
to
minister
:
4
but
it
is
rather
to
be
ascribed
to
the
plainness
and
simplicity
of
the
ancient
Greeks
and
other
nations
;
which
was
such
that
the
sons
and
daughters
of
kings
,
and
others
of
the
first
rank
,
were
employed
in
keeping
flocks
,
and
in
almost
all
other
services
.
Another
reason
why
young
persons
served
at
entertainments
rather
than
those
in
years
was
,
because
by
their
beauty
and
sprightliness
they
were
thought
more
apt
to
exhilarate
the
guests
,
whose
eyes
were
to
be
entertained
as
well
as
their
other
senses
:
on
this
account
the
most
comely
persons
were
deputed
to
this
ministration
,
even
in
the
primitive
times
.
Amongst
the
gods,
πόσνια " Ήβη
Νέκτας έωνοχόει
fair Hebe, the goddess of youth, and daughter of Juno, filled the nectar.5 And Ganymede, the most beautiful of mortal race, was translated by the
gods into heaven, to serve at the table of Jupiter.6 Hence we may learn , that in the most remote times, which were thought the age of the
gods, as those which followed were the age of heroes, this practice was observed . And hence, by the names of places, which are said to be in use among the gods, are to be understood the first and most ancient
names, where the poet tells us, that a certain place in Troas was by the
gods, that is, most anciently, called Myrina's Tomb ; but by men, that is in later times, Batiæa.
That
at
the
time
of
the
Trojan
war
it
was
customary
for
young
persons
of
beautiful
countenances
,
and
well
dressed
,
to
serve
at
entertainments

is

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 699
it was usual to give vast prices for beautiful youths, as we learn from Juvenal,' who reprobates the practice, and from Philo the Jew , who tells us , that it was usual to procure most beautiful slaves to attend at enter tainments, not so much for any service they were to do, as to gratify the
eyes of the beholders : of these the younger boys filled the wine ; those of riper age , being washed, trimmed, and painted , with their hair curled in
various forms, served up the water. The cups and drinking vessels come next to be considered ; and, in Homer, every one of the guests seems to have had a distinct cup, out of which he drank when he
pleased.3 On this account
the cups
of
the
heroic
age
were
very
capacious
;
that
of
Nestor
,
in
par
ticular
,
was
so
weighty
,
that
a
young
man
had
scarce
strength
to
carry
it
:
*
Athenæus
,
however
,
tells
us
that
,
though
men
of
great
estates
and
high
rank
in
his
time
used
large
cups
,
yet
that
was
not
anciently
the
practice
of
Greece
,
but
lately
learned
from
the
barbarous
nations,
who
being
ignorant
of
arts
and
humanity
,
indulge
themselves
in
the
immoderate
use
of
drink
,
and
all
sorts
of
dainties
;
whereas
it
does
not
appear
,
says
he
,
from
the
testimony
of
any
of
those
who
lived
before
our
times
,
that
a
cup
of
a
very
large
size
was
ever
made
use
of
in
any
part
of
Greece
,
except
those
which
belonged
to
the
heroes
.
'
However
,
the
cups
which
they
used
after
supper
were
larger
than
those
they
drank
in
at
supper
.
In
the
houses
of
wealthy
men
there
was
com
monly
a
large
xursxsãoy
,
cupboard
,
furnished
with
cups
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
,
rather
for
ostentation
than
use
.
The
cups
used
by
the
ancient
Greeks
were
very
plain
,
and
corresponded
to
the
rest
of
their
furniture
,
being
usually
composed
of
wood
or
earth
.
Afterwards
,
when
they
began
to
imitate
the
pride
and
vanity
of
the
Asiatics
,
their
cups
were
made
of
silver
,
gold
,
and
other
costly
materials
,
curiously
wrought
,
inlaid
with
precious
stones
,
and
otherwise
adorned
;
but
the
primitive
cups
seem
to
have
been
composed
of
the
horns
of
animals
,
which
persons
of
rank
tipt
with
gold
or
silver
:
these
are
mentioned
by
Pindar
,
Æschylus
,
Xeno
phon
,
and
several
other
authors
:
they
were
also
used
by
some
in
later
ages
,
and
particularly
by
Philip
of
Macedon
.
Hence
,
as
some
are
of
opinion
,
Bacchus
had
the
surname
of
Taurus,
from
his
being
worshipped
by
the
Cyzicenians
in
the
shape
of
a
bull
,
and
painted
with
horns
in
several
other
countries
;
and
some
think
that
the
words
xparãess
,
cups
,
and
zepáru
,
to
mix
wine
with
water
,
are
derived
from
xigata
,
horns.6
The cups were encircled with garlands, and filled up to the brim . Both of these customs are mentioned in the following passage of Virgil :?

And the latter in this verse of Homer,
Κούροι μεν κρητηρως επιστέψαντο ποτοίο ..
For énetéYavto signifies they filled up to the brim ; and stépus, com. monly signifies a sort of fulness ; hence they were wont always rri@ ..
xonagas , to fill the cup to the brim, when libations were offered to the gods, because we offer nothing imperfect to the gods, but only things whole and entire ; and that which is full is entire , 2 The cups were crowned with drink, that is, were filled above the brim , so that the drink rose in the
manner of a crown , for the sake of good luck.
In
the
heroic
times
,
the
young
men
who
ministered
always
presented
full
cups
to
men
of
high
rank
,
and
distributed
wine
to
the
rest
in
equal
proportions
;3
thus
Agamemnon
entertains
Idomeneus
king
of
Crete
:
4
κίπερ γάρ τ ’ άλλοι γε καρηκομόωντες Αχαιοί Restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,
Δαιτρόν πίνωσιν, σον δε πλείον δέπας αλεί Though all the rest with stated rules we bound, “ Eστηχ' ώσπερ εμοί, πιέειν, ότε θυμός ανώγοι. Unmix'd, unmeasur'd, are thy goblets crown'd. For this in banquets, when the generous bowls
Hector, in another place reproaches Diomedes, when he fled from him , with the enjoyment of this honour :5
Τυδείδη, περί μέν σε τίoν Δαναοί ταχύπωλοι Tydides ! the Achæan heroes thee Eόρη το, κρέασίν τε , ιδε πλείοις δεπάεσσι ,

This
respect
is
also
said
to
be
paid
by
the
Lycians
to
Sarpedon
and
Glaucus
,
kings
of
Lycia.6
Another
respect
was
paid
to
the
most
honourable
guests
,
by
drinking
first
to
them
;
for
it
was
customary
for
the
master
of
the
feast
to
drink
to
his
guests
in
order
,
according
to
their
rank
,7
The
manner
of
doing
this
was
by
drinking
part
of
the
cup
,
and
sending
the
remainder
to
the
person
whom
they
named
,
which
they
termed
a
gorivsu
:
but
this
was
only
the
modern
way
,
for
anciently
they
drank
per
tòn
tùy
ozúpov
,
the
whole
cup
,
and
not
a
part
of
it
,
as
was
usual
in
the
time
of
Athenæus
;
to
do
which
,
as
that
author
thinks
,
ought
rather
to
be
termed
#goertisiv
than
,
by
the
old
name
,
sportive
.
The
form
of
saluta
tion
was
various
.
Sometimes
they
who
drank
to
another
used
to
say

as
in

example
,
zažge
,
’
Axiasī
,
I

Sometimes
the
person
who
sent

cup
saluted
his
friend
in
this
form
,
προπίνω

:
the
other
replied

:
and
,
this
being
a
testimony
of
friendship
,
to
drink
in
this
manner
to
another
was
sometimes
termed

Thus
Elian
explains

salutation

account

and

gives

The

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 701
fellowship to drink off whatever remained in the cup ; or if the cup was emptied, to take another of the same size ;l thus Alexander having begun
a very large vessel to Proteas a Macedonian, he drank it off, and presented his service to Alexander in another of the same dimensions. This propination was carried about towards the right hand, where the superior rank of some of the guests did not oblige them to alter that method : hence it was termed degíwois, whence dudeorsolu in Homer is
interpreted a gorivwy değeouobau: thus, in the fourth Iliad, at an assembly of the gods: xevotios demásoos
Δειδέχασ’ αλλήλους
That is, according to Athenæus, ideğivūvto oporivortes saurois dečicis. The same explanation is given by him upon that verse of the ninth Iliad, where Ulysses drinks to Achilles :
Πλησάμενος δ' οίνοιο δίπας δείδεκτ ’ 'Αχιλήα.
That is, says he, έδεξιούτο, ό έστι προέπινεν αυτώ, τη δεξιά διδούς το ποτήριον, he drank to Achilles, delivering the cup with his right hand . This has also been observed by Eustathius. But there is express mention of drinking toward the right hand, in the following passage of Homer,3 where Vulcan fills wine to the gods :
θεοίς ενδέξια πάσιν Qrozóes.
That is, he filled , as the old scholiast explains it, årò tüy doğrūv pispôv,
beginning from the right hand. Another example of this custom is pro duced from Critias's epigram upon Anacreon :
Παις διαπομπεύση προπόσεις εις δεξιόν δμον .. And a third 4 out of the "Aygoixos of Anaxandrides. The doing this,
therefore, was commonly termed švdežice rivsuv ;5 but it was sometimes
called εν κύκλω πίνειν , and the action itself έγκυκλοποσία , because the cup was conveyed round the table , beginning from the uppermost seat.6

was

It was also customary to drink to those who were absent. First the
gods were remembered, then their friends; and at every name, one or more cups of wine, unmixed with water, was drunk off. This is termed
by Cicero, Græco more bibere,8 • to drink after the Grecian manner,' which some interpret of drinking draughts of unmixed wine, out of large cups :9

whereas it was Græcus mos, ut Græci dicunt, oupestitūv uvalisonívous, cumi merum cyathis libant, salutantes primo deos, deinde amicos nominatim , the Grecian method to drink wine out of smallcups, saluting first the gods,
and then their friends by name:' for it was their custom to drink unmixed wine as often as they named the gods or their friends. They were wont
also iniyty rñ yñ, to pour forth some of the wine upon the earth , as often as they mentioned any person's name, this being the manner of offering libations ; it seems to have been a form of adoration when any of the gods,
were named , and of prayer for their friends, when they mentioned them : amongst their friends they most commonly named their mistresses. ? Sometimes the number of cups equalled that of the letters in their mis tress's name,3 Na e via sex cyathis, septem Justin a bibatur.
There were also several other modes of numbering the cups to be drunk off at once : thus, three were taken off, because the Graces were
of that number, and nine, according to the number of the Muses:4 the
Greeks thus expressed this custom , "Hygis, i agis ogía , either three, or three times three . There was another saying, which forbade the drinking
of four cups, that being no lawful number : 'Hrgic rivs, ñ din Tétragu , Yet they did not always observe the number ee, as appears from the
following epigram, which commands to fill ten cups to the health of Dirodice, and nine to that of Euphrante . 'Εγχει Δειροδίκης κυάθους δέκα , της δε ποθεινής Ευφράντης ένα μοι ήττο δίδου κυάθον ..
Sometimes they contended who should drink most. Alexander the
Macedonian is reported to have drunk a cup containing two congii, (which contained more than our pottle, though less than our gallon ,) to Proteas, who, commending the king's ability, pledged him ; then called for another cup of the same dimensions, and drank it off to him. The king, as the
laws of good fellowship required, pledged Proteas in the same cup ; but being immediately overcome, fell back upon his pillow , letting the eup fall out of his hands, and by that means brought on the disease of which he shortly after died.5 Prizes were sometimes awarded to the conquerors ;
this custom was ingeniously inverted by Anacharsis, the Scythian philoso pher, who being entertained by Periander, one of the seven sages, and king of Corinth, demanded the prize for being first drunk ; that, as he
said, being the end at which all aim in drinking, as racers press forward toward the goal. It is reported by Timæus, that Dionysius the Sicilian, at an entertainment, promised a crown of gold to the person who should first drink a cup containing a congius, and that Xenocrates the philosopher obtained the prize. And at the funeral of Calanus, the Indian philoso
pher, there were not only exercises and musical contentions, but also

drinking matches, in which the prize, promised by Alexander to the first conqueror, was a talent; that to the second, thirty uram, that to the third ,
ten gevai. One Promachus obtained the first prize, having drank four congii of unmixed wine : thirty of the combatants died on the spot, and in a short time after, six more expired in their tents. When any person drank off a large cup αμυστι, that is, απνευστι, άνευ του αναπαύεσθαι, υith
out intermission , or taking his breath , the company used to applaud him in this form : Zhosias, long may you live ? At Athens there were three public officers who attended at entertainments and observed whether every person drank his portion : they were called from their business, olyón TOCI,
and sometimes by a metaphorical name, ipeadpoi, eyes. They who refused to drink were in most places obliged to depart, by that celebrated law of good fellowship , " H Tidi, žaibi, drink, or begone.4 Hence it appears how much the Greeks were addicted to drinking ; por were the Romans more free from that vice : Seneca himself thought it allowable to drink, even to drunkenness, to ease the mind of any great
and tormenting cares. Cato of Utica sometimes spent whole nights in drinking. And concerning the elder Cato, as also Corvinus the stoic
philosopher, to mention no more examples, we have the testimony of Horace," that the latter, though tinged with Socratic principles, was no
enemy to the wine- cask ; and that the former ofteu enlivened and invigo rated his virtue by wine .
Yet others disapproved of the immoderate use of wine. Some lawgivers
enacted laws against it, and others prohibited all compotations where more wine was used than was necessary for health. Some of the Grecian sages allowed no more than three cups ; one for health , a second for cheerful
ness, and a third for sleep.6 Panyasis allowed no more than the second cup ; the first to the Graces, Hours, and Bacchus, the second to Venus
and Bacchus ; they who proceeded to the third cup, according to that author, dedicated it to Lust and Strife. Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver,
prohibited unnecessary drinking, which debilitates both the body and mind ; and ordered that no man should drink for any other purpose than to satisfy his thirst .? And to lay on the Spartans a necessity of keeping
themselves within the bounds of sobriety, the same lawgiver enacted
farther, that all men should return from entertainments without a torch to show them the way . Hence the propinations and methods of drinking which other nations observed were unheard of at Sparta.8

ployed in making themselves useful to the commonwealth . Lastly, to mention only one example more , as the island of Mitylene abounded with wine, in order to restrain the inhabitants from the immoderate use
of it, Pittacus, their lawgiver, one of the seven sages, enacted, that who ever committed a crime when drunk, should suffer double punishment. " There were some particular and solemn cups mentioned in ancient
authors, which are next to be described ; such were,
'Ayedoll Auipovos rigating, the cup of Good Genius, by whom was under
stood Bacchus, the inventor of wine ; in memory of which benefit a cup of full unmixed wine was carried round the table, which all the guests tasted, at the same time raising an ejaculation to the god that he would preserve them from committing any indecency through the immoderate
use of that liquor ; hence on.YOTOTOŪTES, persons who drink very little, are termed åyalodaiponotab. Whether this cup was brought in before the table on which they supped was taken away , or afterwards, is not agreed ;
that it was sometimes brought in before the taking away of the table , seems probable from what is related of Dionysius the Sicilian , who, being
entertained in the temple of Æsculapius in Syracuse, at a table of gold, as soon as he had tasted the cup of Good Genius, commanded the table to be carried off.
Keethg Aids Ewrñgos, the cup of Jupiter the Saviour, which was mixed
with water, and dedicated to Jupiter, president of the air, which is the
most humid element; in memory of the invention of tempering wine with water,
Kearing 'Tyısías, the cup of Health, is added by some, and as well as
that of Jupiter, is termed Metaurrgis, or petávatpov, as being drunk after the washing of their hands, the entertainment being ended ; and the
same names are, for the same reason, given by some to the cup of Good Genius.2
Kgathe 'Eguoũ, the cup of Mercury, to whom a libation was offered before they went to bed , when they gave over drinking. Others state the order of the solemn cups in a different manner.
According to Suidas ,4 three cups were brought in at supper ; the first dedicated to Mercury, the second to Charisius, which is a surname given
to Jupiter, from xágos, favour or grace , because through his influence men obtain the favour and affection of one another ; and in this, it is pro
bable, respect was had to the invention of tempering wine with water ; the third to Jupiter the Saviour.
Others mention one cup of wine, mixed with water, dedicated to Olympian Jupiter ; a second to the heroes ; a third and last to Jupiter the Saviour, so called on this occasion , to intimate that the third cup might be safely taken, without any disorder of mind or body: this cup was called ríassos, either because it was the last, which is one meaning of that

word , or from the perfection of the number three, which, having a begin ning, middle, and end, was accounted the first complete number, whence it was commonly applied to divine things, and particularly to human souls, which, according to the Platonic philosophy, consisted of this number. It must not be omitted, that the first and last cups were sacred to Jupiter, who is the supreme deity, the beginning and the end of all things; and the middle cup, to the heroes, who were thought to be of an intermediate
nature between gods and men. It may also be observed, that most
authors, however variously describing them in other respects, agree in fixing the sacred cups to the number three ; hence the saying?
Μέχρι γάρ τριών φασί τιμών τους Θεούς ..
The entertainment being ended, before they engaged in the diversions
used on such occasions, a libation of wine, with a prayer, was offered, and a hymn sung to the gods. Thus we are told by Xenophon , that when , at the entertainment described by him, the tables were taken away , and
they had offered a libation and sung a hymn to the gods, a certain man of Syracuse brought in a skilful minstrel,' &c. Virgil describes the libation in such a manner that it should seem to have been poured out of the cup of Good Genius ; and this is another proof that this cup was not filled till the tables were taken away, which indeed at fortelsen ut vuiseems to have been the time of drinking all

Nobody ever dances, even in solitude, or at a private meeting of friends,
who is not either drunk or mad . Dancing is always the last act of riotous banquets, gay places, and much jollity.'. And Cornelius Nepos,4
having related that Epaminondas well understood the art of dancing, of playing upon the harp and flute, with other liberal sciences, adds,
though in the opinion of the Romans these were trivial things, and not
worthy to be mentioned,yet in Greece they were thought very commend able .' The same observation is also made by that author in his preface
to the Lives of the Illustrious Commanders. And these arts were held
in such estimation among the Greeks, that they regarded vocal and in strumental music as the greatest erudition ; and therefore it is recorded of Epaminondas, who, in my opinion , was the first man among the Greeks,
that he played excellently on the flute ; and Themistocles, some years before, was deemed ignorant because he refused at an entertainment to play on the lyre. For this reason musicians flourished in Greece ; music was a general study ; and whoever was unacquainted with it, was not considered as fully instructed in learning..'35 Nevertheless, wanton and effeminate dances were thought to be indecent in men of wisdom and character ; hence
Hippoclides the Athenian, having been designed by Clisthenes, king of Argo for his daughter's husband, and preferred before all the young
noblemen of Greece, was rejected, for his light and unbecoming dances and gestures. The Ionians delighted in wanton dances and songs more than the rest of the Greeks, their manners being more corrupted than
those of any other nation in Greece ; their mode of singing was very dif ferent from the ancient, and their harmony more loose and wanton ; and wanton gestures were proverbially termed Ionici motus, ' Ionian motions." In the primitive ages, the entertainments were seldom made but on
the festivals of the gods; and the songs were commonly hymns in praise of their deities ; the singing of which was accounted a part of divine wor ship. Soft and wanton songs were then unknown ; hence Athenæus was
of opinion that music was not brought into use at entertainments for the

sake of any mean and vulgar pleasure, but to compose the passions of the soul, and to improve men's manners. And from the descriptions of entertainments which we find in Homer, it appears that the songs used
about the time of the Trojan war consisted chiefly of hymns, in which the actions of the gods and heroes were celebrated ; but in later ages it was so uncommon to sing sacred hymns at entertainments, that Aristotle was
accused by Demophilus of an act of very great impiety for singing a pæan every day at his meals.?
The most remarkable songs at entertainments were those termed
ozór, with the accent on the first syllable , by which it is distinguished from the adjective oroasa , which is accented upon the last syllable ;3 whence
in the present editions of Athenæus, which often call thesesongs ononià,
they who will acquiesce in the judgment of that critic must read oxóaso. These scolia consisted for the most part of short verses, hence oxóason is interpreted sonnet, consisting of short verses , and derived from oxonidy,
crooked, difficult, and obscure, which, by the figure antiphrasis, may be rendered easy. Others observe, that scolia cannot be derived from
sxodios, difficult, or obscure ; because these songs were commonly light and cheerful; but that, as there were three sorts of songs at entertain
ments , of which the first was sung by the whole company joining in a choir, the second by all the company in their turns, and the third by some few who were best skilled in music ; this last was termed oxóasov,
from the adjective ononsòv, signifying crooked , as being sung out of course , and not by every man in his own place, like the two former. The cus
tom was thus : after the company had all sung in a chorus, or one after another, a musical instrument, most commonly a harp or lute, was carried
round to every person, that such as understood music might entertain the company . They who would not, or could not play upon the instrument, were presented with a branch of laurel or myrtle, which they held in their hands, and to which they sung : this was termed. Ergòs dépeny, or agès
puppívny ädery, to sing towards the laurel or the myrtle. This branch was
also termed αίσακος, or άσακος παρά το ασαι τον δεξάμενον, because the person who received it was obliged to sing, as we are informed by Plu tarch ,? who more agreeably to the former account, and perhaps to the truth, observes, that the oxóre were not sung by all who could not play
upon the musical instrument, which is the opinion of Hesychius, but only by those who were skilled in music : hence he derives the name from oróxos, difficult, to sing one of these songs being what could not be done
by any but proficients in the art of music. He farther adds, that some were of opinion that the branch of myrtle was not delivered to the com

pany in a direct order, but carried from couch to couch, so as when the first person in the uppermost coueh had done singing, he delivered to the
first in the second couch, from whom it was transmitted to the first of the third couch : that the seconds in each couch delivered it to one another in
the same manner, and so forward, til it had passed through the whole company ; and that on this account the songs were termed oxów , from
oranoòs, as it signifies crooked, by reason of the several windings in carry ing about the branch of myrtle. These scolia were chiefly used by the Athenians, but they were not unknown in other parts of Greece, where we find several celebrated writers of scolia to have lived ; as Anacreon of Teos, Alcæus of Lesbos, Praxilla of Sicyon, and others. Their subjects
were of various kinds : some of them were exwarixà , rà dè égwrixà, toarà dè xou otoudaid , ludierous and satirical, others amorous , and many of them serious. Those on serious subjects sometimes contained
παραίνεσίν τινα και γνώμην χρησίμην εις τον βιον , α practical exhortation on
sentence ;3 sometimes they consisted of the praises and illustrious actions
of great men, and commonly bore the names of the persons whom they celebrated : thus ' Agrodiou réaos, the song of Harmodius, was the scolium
composed by Callistratus upon Harmodius, the famous patriot, who deliv ered Athens from the tyranny of Hipparchus the son of Pisistratus, whom
he killed.4 ' Aduntou nógos was a scolium upon Admetus king of Thes saly : it is mentioned by the same author:
'Αδμήτου λόγον, ώ ταίρε, μαθών, τους αγάθους φίλει. Τούτω τι λέξεις σχόλιον ..
There are many examples of the ancient scolia preserved in the Greek authors, of which I shall only set down that one which was composed by
Aristotle upon Hermias, tyrant of Atarnea, which, though Demophilus, suborned by one Eurymedon , affirmed to be a sacred pæan , in order to
prove the philosopher, who daily used this song, guilty of impiety, as has been before related, yet it is, from the very phrase and diction, plainly
demonstrated to be nothing more than an ordinary scolium , by Demo critus in Athenæus :5

From the songs let us pass to the sports and pastimes which followed entertainments. This was the ancient method, as we learn from Homer's
description of an entertainment made by Alcinous, king of Phæacia, wherein the entertainment being taken away , and the music ended, the
guests are invited to wrestle, leap, run races, and participate in other hodily exercises: 1

Whence Eustathius observes, that the heroes did not rest after meals, for the better concoction of their meat, as became customary in later ages ;
on which pretence the later Greeks, laying aside the violent exercises which were anciently used , diverted themselves with such sports and recreations as required less toil and labour. The several sorts of sports and games which were practised by the Greeks, are too numerous to be recounted in this place ; the xóttußos, however, which was more peculiar to entertainments, must not be omitted. This pastime was first invented
in Sicily , whence it was communicated to most of the other parts of Greece, especially to Athens, where it obtained very great repute. The
form was thus: a piece of wood being erected, another was placed upon the top of it, with two dishes hanging down from each extremity, in the man ner of scales; beneath each dish was placed a vessel full of water, in which
stood a statue, composed for the most part of brass, and called párns. They who undertook xotraßizsıv, to play at the cottabus, stood at some distance, holding a cup of water or wine, which they endeavoured to throw into one of the dishes, that the dish by thatweight might be knocked against the head of the statue under it. The person who threw in such a manner
aş to spill the smallest quantity of water, and to knock the dish with the greatest force upon the statue, was conqueror, and was thought to reign in
the affections of his mistress, which was the thing to be learned by this

pastime. The sound made by the projection was, by an onomatopæia , termed λάταξ ; and the wine projected λατάγη, and sometimes λάταξ . The action , as also the cup out of which the wine was projected , was called
αγκύλη, because την δεξιάν χείρα ήγκύλουν, they turned round their right hand with a sort of dexterity and art upon which they valued themselves very much. Hence we find mention of xórtebo úryxvanto in Æschylus. The vessels were named κότταβοι, οι κοτσαβίδες" and the prizes, whicli were sweatmeats, kisses, or whatever else the company agreed upon , κοτσάβια , κοτταβεία , and also κότταβοι. The play itself, to distingui it from others of the same name, was termed xóttabos KATAXTÓS. So
much addicted were the Greeks to this pastime, that they had not only vessels made for it with the utmost art and care , but circular houses, built in such a manner, that the cottabus being placed exactly in the middle, the gamesters might stand at equal distances on all sides.
There was another sort of cottabus, in which a vessel was placed full of
water, with empty vials swimming upon it ; into this they projected wine out of cups ; and he that had the fortune to drown the greatest number of the vials obtained the prize.
There was also another sort of cottabus in which they projected dice.
Lastly, another sort of cottabus is mentioned, which was a contention who should sit up awake the longest : the prize was commonly a cake made of honey and sesame, or wheat, and was thence termed onoauoüs,
or aupapolls: the latter seems to have been most common , whence it is men tioned alone by Artemidorus, ήν δε ο πυραμούς παρά τους παλαιούς επινίκιος : the pupapeolls was anciently the prize,2 and hence that word became a general name for any other prize.3
It was also held necessary to entertain the guests with suitable discourses, as well as with sports and pastimes. In the opinion of the ancient Greeks,
it was more requisite and becoming to gratify the company by agreeable conversation than with variety of dishes.' And in the heroic ages it was customary at entertainments to consult about affairs of the greatest mo ment :5 hence Nestor in Homer6 persuades Agamemnon to invite the Grecian commanders to an entertainment, in order to deliberate concern
ing the management of the war :
Δαίνυ δαίτα γέρoυσι , έoικο του, ούτοι αεικές. Banquet the elders, it shall not disgrace Thy sovereignty, but shall become thee well.
Πολλών δ' άγρομένων, τα πείσει ός κεν αρίστην
Βουλήν βουλεύση.. Thy many guests assembled, thou shalt hear Our counsel, and shalt choosethe best.
It was believed that at such times men's invention was more quick and fruitful, according to the saying in Aristophanes :?

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 711
It was also the custom in Persia to consult at entertainments, concern
ing warlike preparations and other serious affairs, after the manner of the ancient Greeks; nay , if Strabo may be believed , they used to consult about atlairs of the highest importance over their wine; and what was there de termined was held more firm and inviolable than their sober resolutions.
According to Herodotus, those things on which they resolved (výQoutes ) when they were sober were canvassed over again when they had drunk freely, and the things which they determined (uidvoxóusvoi) in their drink were examined again in their sober hours. Not unlike this is what Tacitus reports of the Germans, that their consultations about the reconciliation of
enemies, the contracting of affinities, the appointment of princes, and all
other affairs, whether military or civil, were for the most part held at
entertainments. The way of the syssitia in Crete was as follows :5 Supper being ended , they first deliberated upon civil affairs ; then the discourse was turned to war, at which time they repeat the praises of illustrious
persons , προτρεπόμενοι τους νέους είς άνδραγαθίαν, thereby to excite the young men to courage and bravery . The Lacedæmonian youth frequented the
syssitia, ws didaorahsia ow@gooúrns, as the schools of temperance and prudence, ia which they heard discourses of public affairs, and conversed
with the most liberal and best accomplished masters. The Cretan åvågzice and the Spartan Puditiu, that is, their public places of entertainment,
βουλευτηρίων απορρήτων και συνεδρίων αριστοκρατικών τάξιν είχεν, were instead of councils, where the chief men of the commonwealth met to consult about
the most secret affairs; and the prytaneum and thesmothesium , or public halls in Chæronea, seem to have been applied to the same use.
custom seems to have obtained in several other cities, and particularly at Athens, where the supreme council supped every day together in the pry
taneum ; and ,? at Rhodes, where the chief magistrates were obliged, by an express law , every day to entertain the principal men of that city at a
public table , in order to deliberate what should be done the day following.'
Hence, it has been supposed,8 Bacchus had the surname of EyBourns, pru dent counsellor ; and the night was called süpgóvn , as being the time of wise and prudent counsels. Not unlike these is that assembly of most wise
and excellent persons in Plato, where things of the greatest concern are discussed . As they who were concerned in public business used to dis
course of public affairs, so the conversation of philosophers was commonly upon some philosophical subject ; grammarians disputed upon critical sub jects , and others conversed in their several ways, insomuch that every art and science was cultivated and improved upon these occasions ; hence it has been justly remarked, “ that the Greeks did not drink to excess at their
public entertainments, but only to keep up the conversation about serious

affairs, Specimens of the discourse at entertainments may be found in
Plato and Xenophon , and might have been found ( had they been yet extant) in Aristotle, Speusippus, Epicurus, Hieronymus, and Dio the
academic , who wrote λόγους παρά πόσον γενομένους , Books of Table -dis courses .?
It was however also customary by turns to unbend their minds, and divert them from serious affairs, by discourses upon ludicrous subjects:
hence cuperório , the Greek name for an entertainment, is defined , κοινωνία σπουδής και παιδιάς, λόγων και πράξεων , α mixture of seriousness and mirth , of discourses and actions. At the forementioned syssitia of the Lacedæmonians, where the most grave and important subjects were
treated on , they also used to sport and to jest, though without any of that scurrility and reflection which is apt to give offence 3 And from the Table - discourses of Plutarch and others, it appears to have been the ancient custom to contrive their discourses in such a manner as would
both entertain and instruct the company: nevertheless, in the time of Plutarch, they rarely discoursed upon any serious argument at public entertainments ; and hence when a discourse was begun at the table of
Nicostratus, concerning a subject which was to be discussed in the popular assembly at Athens, some of the company , who had never heard of the ancient Greek custom , affirmed that it was an imitation of the Persians.
And this question is propounded in the same author,5 Whether were allowable to discourse philosophy over their cups? Some delighted to tell stories, and to repeat ancient fables on these occasions ; others chose to
read some diverting discourse Coñow sirsiv ), or to hear a poem recited, which was very common among men of letters ; but no diversion was more usual than that of propounding and answering difficult questions. Such of these as were designed merely for amusement, were termed aiyiyuata, but those which farther contained something serious and instructive, were
called yeimos, which word ,6 in its primitive acceptation, signifies a fishing net. Hence, to use the words of Clearchus, . the Griphi contained philo
sophical disquisitions, in which the ancients used to give a specimen of their learning, insomuch that this pastime became a proof of every person's
proficiency in learning. The person who solved the question propounded was honoured with a reward ; he who was not so fortunate underwent a
certain punishment: the rewards were otipavos raí süpnuía , a garland and the applause of the company : the punishment was, to drink, without taking breath, a cup of wine, mixed with salt :8 according to some, the reward 9 was a dish of meat ; the penalty a salt cup. Others report, that a cup of wine was the prize, which was adjudged to him who solved the riddle ; or
in case no man could solve it, to the person by whom it was propounded. 10

OF THE MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS OF GREECE. 713
Hesychius tells us that ygípos is “ an enigmatical question at compotations, which, whoever fails of solving, is obliged to drink that which is set before him, whether it be unmixed wine or water ;' and there is no doubt but
the rewards and penalties were varied, according to the disposition of the company. The common name of these, and of all other questions used on
similar occasions, was xurízsio Enthuatl . Theodectes the sophist termed
them punuóvia SnTÁllata , because he had got a set of them by heart, which was usually done by such as frequented public entertainments. That the
custom of propounding riddles was very ancient, and introduced from the eastern nations into Greece, appears from the story of Samson , in the book
of Judges, who propounded a riddle to the Philistines at his nuptial feast. Neither were these questions confined to entertainments, but, in the primi tive times, were proposed on other occasions, by those who desired to put to the test each other's wisdom and learning. Hence there is mentionof the
queen of Sheba’s question to king Solomon ,2 of those which passed between Hiram and Solomon , and of several others. Sometimes the entertainer made presents to all his guests. Lysimachus
of Babylon having entertained Himerus, the tyrant of the Babylonians and Seleucians, with 300 other guests, gave every man a silver cup of four pounds weight . When Alexander made his marriage-feast at Susa in
Persia, he paid the debts of all his soldiers out of his own exchequer, and
presented to each of his guests, who were not fewer than nine thousand , a golden cup.4 From these instances, it appears that cups were commonly presented on these occasions. This was done because it was customary for the company, before they parted, to pour forth wine, as a libation to
Mercury, who was accounted the president of the night, and believed to send sleep and pleasing dreams, whence he is called by Homer5 vuxtòs
όπωπητήρ and ηγήτωρ ονείρων. To the same god they also sacrificed the tongues of the animals which had been killed for the entertainment. The
reason of this rite was by some thought to be , that Mercury being the president of eloquence, was chiefly delighted with that member ; others rather think that by this sacrifice he was invoked as a witness of the dis course which had passed . Some are of opinion , that by burning the
tongues at the conclusion of the meeting, was intimated , that whatever had been there discoursed should be kept secret. Several other conjectures
concerning the origin of this custom have been made by learned men.6 It was chiefly observed by the Athenians, Ionians, and Megarensians. And some affirm that it originated with one of the kings of Megara, who having the tongue of a lion, which had wasted his country , brought to him
hy Pelops, sacrificed it at the end of an entertainment. It was certainly very ancient; whence, according to Apollonius, it was observed by the
Argonauts. And it is practised by the heroes in Homer :

OF THE MANNER OF ENTERTAINING STRANGERS .
The keeping of public inns for the reception of strangers was assigned by Plato to foreigners, or the meanest sort of citizens, as an illiberal and
mean employment. The ancient Greeks had no public inns, which were an invention of later ages. In the primitive times, men lived at home,
neither caring to cultivate friendship with foreigners, nor to improve themselves and their estates by commerce with them. Nor was it safe
to travel without a strong guard, the sea and land being both exceedingly

infested with robbers, who not only spoiled all whom they caught of their
valuable goods, but treated their persons with the utmost cruelty, as ap pears from the stories of Procrustes, Sinnes, Sciron, Periphetes, and others. To live on the plunder of others, was then by many thought a
very honourable way of subsisting ; and they placed a sort of glory in overcoming and spoiling their neighbours, believing that the rules of
· humanity and justice were observed by none but such as were destitute
of power. Hence , among the ancient Greeks, strangers and enemies were both des ated by the same name, gvos, all strangers being then accounted enemies. And the Persians, who for several ages waged con
tinual wars with Greece, are particularly signified by that word . The
Lacedæmonians are said to have termed the barbarous nations, whom the Greeks took for their common enemies, by the name gevor3 And among
the primitive Latins, the name hostis, which was afterwards appropriated to enemies, signified a stranger .
The sea was freed from pirates by Minos king of Crete, who with a strong fleet for a long time maintained the dominion of all the seas
around that island . The land robbers were destroyed by Hercules, The
seus, and other primitive heroes ; from which times, Xenophon reports, that till his own age, no man offered violence to strangers.' And in the earliest ages, all who were not entirely void of humanity are said to have entertained strangers with respect : it was then the custom to supply them with victuals, and other necessaries, before they inquired their names, or asked them any other questions. Thus Telemachus and his
company are treated by Menelaus, who thus bespeaks them upon their arrival at Sparta :

one was termed sorphingiv, in which strangers were lodged , the other åvdesãos, being the place of eating, in which all the Cretans supped to gether : in the uppermost part of this room there was a constant table set
apart for strangers, and called zgánica Ševia, sevixò, or síos Gaviouo ac cording to others, two tables were appointed for this use. And in the
distribution of victuals, the strangers were always served before the king, or any of the Cretan nation ; and some of them were permitted to bear very important offices in the state. ?
The rest of the Greeks, and especially the Athenians, vere generally courteous to strangers, except the Lacedæmonians, who are censured for
their want of hospitality ; and hence are described as most opposite to the Athenians in their behaviour to strangers. For the same reason they
are called by Aristophanes desigwyóževos,4 and by others tevnaktai, from their imposing upon strangers and driving them away : this is the more
to be wondered at, because Lycurgus, in the regulations which he made at Sparta, chiefly followed the laws and manners of Crete. Nevertheless,
it is very certain that very good care was taken of strangers at Sparta. It was one part of the royal office to make provision for them ; and M. Antoninus affirms,6 that strangers had a convenient place assigned in the shade , whereas the Lacedæmonians themselves lay down without distinc tion of places. But the opinion of their rough and uncivil usage of
strangers seems to have prevailed chiefly upon these two accounts : 1. Because foreigners, when they lived on the Spartan diet, which was extremely coarse , thought themselves ill entertained ;) and, 2. because
strangers had admittance into Sparta only on ωρισμέναι ημέραι, certain days. This last appointment was a provision against the promiscuous and frequent concourse of other nations, which they avoided as much as they possibly could, either to prevent foreigners from observing the faults
and miscarriages of Sparta,9 with which Pericles in Thucydides 10
also to reproach them, or rather to prevent the manners of their citizens from being corrupted by a too free and unlimited conversation with other
nations:11 for the same reason an edict was once published at Rome, by which strangers were forbidden the use of that city.12 Aud the Lacedæ
monians were not allowed to travel into foreign countries, lest they should introduce foreign customs and vices into Sparta . " That these and similar laws were not enacted without sufficient cause , appears from the history of Lysander and of Agesilaus, the former whom returning
home from Athens, and the latter from Asia, contributed very much to
the general corruption of manners, which, soon after, destroyed the an cient Lacedæmonian discipline and mode of living. In order to excite the people to treat strangers with kindness and

respect, the ancient poets and lawgivers persuaded them that strangers
were under the peculiar care of certain gods, who revenged all the inju ries done to them . In the number of these gods were reckoned Minerva,
Apollo , Venus, Castor and Pollux, and chiefly Jupiter, who had hence the surname of Eivos , hospitable ; which was also sometimes given to other gods, who were believed to protect strangers: - hence Ulysses in Homer endeavours to appease Polyphemus with the consideration , that Jupiter was the patron and avenger of strangers. And Eumæus is moved
by the same reason to entertain the same hero, as himself professes : Ξείν', ού μοι θεμις έστ' ουδ' ει κακίων σέθεν έλθοι, To slight the poor, or aught homane despise : Ξεϊνον ατιμήσαι" προς γάρ Διός εισίν άπαντες For Jove unfolds our hospitable door ; Ξεϊνοί τε, πτωχοί τε. "Tis Jove that sends the stranger and the poor. The swain replied ; It never was our guise
For the same end the gods were feigned to travel in the habit of strangers : thus Jupiter speaks of himself in Ovid :3 Et deus humana lustro sub imagine terras.
In another passage of that author, the same god, accompanied by Mer
cury , is said to have been denied reception by 1000 houses, which, for
that offence , he turned , with the adjoining country , into a lake. Lycaon was said to have been transformed into a wolf for his injurious treatment
of Jupiter. And , to mention only one example more , when Antinous in Homer 5 treats Ulysses, who there appears like a stranger, injuriously,
he is reminded that the gods used to visit the cities of men in the habit and form of strangers:
Και το θεοί ξείνοισιν έoικότες αλλοδαποίσι They ( curious oft of mortal actions) deign, Παντοίσι τελάθοντες, επιστρωφώσι πολήας, In forms like these, to round the earth and main ; 'Ανθρώπων 8βριν τε και ευνομίην εφορώντες. Just and unjust recording in their mind, And with sure eyes inspecting all mankind.-POPE.
The rites of entertaining strangers were the same with those of re
ceiving guests at entertainments, with this exception , that salt was com monly set before strangers, before they tasted the victuals provided for
them ; by which it was intimated, that as salt consists of aqueous and terrene particles mixed and united together, or as it is a concrete of several aqueous parts, so the stranger and the person by whom he was
entertained should , from the time of their tasting salt together, maintain a constant union of love and friendship. Others tell us, that salt being
apt to preserve flesh from corruption , signified, that the friendship which was then begun should be firm and lasting. And some think that a regard was had to the purifying quality of salt, which was commonly used in lustrations, and that it intimated, that friendship ought to be free from all design and artifice, jealousy and suspicion . It may be, the ground
of this custom was only this, that salt was constantly used at all enter tainments , both of the gods and men ; whence a particular sanctity was believed to be lodged in it. It is hence called Jeños cas, divine salt, by

Ilomer ; and isgoà árss , holy salt, by others ; and by the placing of salt on the tables, a sort of holiness was thought to be imparted to them . !
Indeed, whatever in any way conduced to promote love and concord ,
especially in those early times when men lived by spoil and rapine, was held to be sacred ; hence the table was thought to be endowed with an inherent holiness, as well as the salt . Το ομοσράπεζoν, to have eaten at
the same table, was esteemed an inviolable obligation to friendship ; and
cha xai apánileev rapesecivev, to transgress the salt and the table, that is, to break the laws of hospitality, and to injure one by whom any person had been entertained , was accounted one of the blackest crimes ; hence
that exaggerating interrogation of Demosthenes,2 Που δε άλες και που τρά
πεζαι και ταύτα γαρ τραγωδεί παριών: Where is the salt ? where the hospi table tables ? for in despite of these he has been the author of these trou bles : hence, too, in Lycophron, the crime of Paris in stealing Helena is
aggravated by Cassandra,: upon this consideration, that he had contemned the salt, and overturned the hospitable table . Tò opboteyou, to converse
under the same roof, was thought to be a sort of engagement to love and courtesy. 4
The

which
was
contracted

was
termed

;
it
was
held
very

,
and
was
rather

the

than
the

Teucer

to
deprive

though
he
was

Hence
it

that

were deposited by the ancient Greeks among their treasures to keep alive the memory of their friendships to succeeding generations.! The later Greeks used to break korpáyunos, a die, into two parts, one of which the guests carried away , the other remained with the enter tainer, The same custom was used at Rome, where each part of the
die was termed tessera hospitalis.3 Upon these tesseræ , their names, or some other character of distinction , as also the image of Jupiter Hospi talis, were commonly engraven. When they renounced their hospitable alliance, it was customary to break in pieces the hospitable tessera ; hence tesseramfrangere signifies to violate the laws of hospitality .
They who entertained private strangerswere termed idrorgóğsvor. They who received ambassadors, and other foreigners, who came on any public
account, were called agáčevo. . But the same name is often given to men who entertained their own private friends of other nations. If the person who received the foreigners, who came under a public character, did it voluntarily , he was called ide20fgóğivos ; in this sense Pithias is called by
Thucydides iberon gócevos ’ Adnvolwr, the voluntary entertainer of the
Athenians. But more commonly the gótsvol were appointed to that office, either by the suffrages of the people in popular governments, or by designation of the king, in monarchical countries. Thus, at Sparta, the kings appointed τους άν έθέλουσι των αστών, whomsoever of the citizens
they pleased to be proveni.? Nor did the office of proxeni consist only in providing lodging and entertainment for the forementioned strangers ; but
it was also their duty to conduct them to the king, or the popular assem bly, to provide for them convenient places in the theatre, and to serve and assist them on all other occasions. Hence, xaco Tivos ñ xaxoũ QÏTIOS,
whoever was the procurer of any good or evil to another person was termed
apótevos. The author of another man's ruin and misery was called orgógeros
απωλείας , Or πρόξενος φθοράς : the author of his safety and felicity , πρόξενος σωτηρίας , or πρόξενος υγιείας.8 The office of prođeni was by the more modern Greeks called fagoxin, which word is used in that sense in one of St Basil's epistles. Ilagovai
are by Hesychius interpreted χαρίσματα , δωρήματα, presents or gifts , and public entertainments are called by Cicero, parochiæ publicæ ; unless instead of these words, we read, as some learned men have done, paro
chus publicus; for the officers were called srágoxon and Gevorágozou. The ancient Romans called them copiarii, but Horacelo uses the name of paro chus, which was current in his age :

Whoever undertook a journey, first implored the divine protection . Before their departure into any foreign country, it was customary to sa lute, and, as it were, take leave of the deities of their own country , by kissing the earth. The same rite of salutation was commonly practised
on their arrival in any country: thus Ulysses, in Phæacia ,3 xúos de Zsídwpov depougæv, kissed the fruitful earth ; and Cadmus in Boeotia ,4 oscula terre figit, .imprints kisses on the soil.' In this manner they paid homage to,
and invoked the assistance and protection of, irigógioi Jeol, the gods who were the patrons of that country ; and during their residence in that place they worshipped the same gods. This was done by the Samaritans, whom
the king of Assyria planted in the country of Israel, as we learn from the sacred history , and by Alexander the Great, whilst he staid in Troas, as
the writers of his life and actions report. Lastly , when they returned home, they saluted the gods of their own country in the same manner,
and gave them thanks for their safe return . This was done by Ulysses at his return to Ithaca;5 by Agamemnone when he returned to Mycenæ ; and by Hercules? on his return from the infernal regions.

HISTORY OF GREEK LITERATURE.
The Greeks in a dream of national vanity, gave out their noblest stocks for the offspring of their own soil . They were ashamed to deduce their origin from any country, whose inhabitants they justly deemed inferior to
themselves in the arts of war and peace. This fanciful hypothesis, how ever false as fa: as regards the people, becomes true when applied to one part of their intellectual history. Their literature was indeed autoch thonal. The rise of mental refinement among them was independent of
other races of men ; and its development was their own work . Their literary greatness, whose remains are a brighter trophy than the memory of their martial deeds or of their political systems, was the growth of the beautiful region which it adorned ; and the same hands which reaped the field had sown it. It is not denied that they knew of the intellectual
progress of nations anterior to themselves, nor that materials for thought to fashion, or imagination to embellish, were drawn by them , to a large extent, from foreign sources. But as it was with the language, so was it
with the literature of the Greeks. Just as their language, after its principles were once fixed, and its vocabulary was established on a broad
basis, while it admitted contributions from other lands, caused them to pass through an assimilating process of naturalization ; so, to the ideas that
poured in from various quarters, their plastic minds gave a new consis tent shape and an exalted value. Thus, among the elements of their my thology, originally discordant, though blended by genius into a wonderful
semblance of uniformity, we perceive strong traces of the Oriental and Egyptian creeds ; but the parts taken from them have been cast in a fresh mould, and reproduced in more captivating lineaments. The monstrous
is subdued into the vast ; the grotesque is softened into the graceful; and
a fine spirit of humanity is diffused over the rude proportions of the primeval figures. Such , likewise, has been the case with the Grecian mental philosophy. Many of its dogmas, some of its most remarkable

forms, are evidently derived from Egypt or the East ; but all that tends to beautify the mean , to harmonize the incongruous, or to enliven the dull ; all that converts the simple precepts of morality, or the crude mate
rial of metaphysics, into an elegant department of literature ; belongs to the Greeks themselves. From the first dawn of intellectual culture among
them they were creators of something new, not mechanical echoers of the old. Upon the earliest manifestation of their genius there is no foreign
stamp ; their literature displays at once a proper , peculiar character. Its aspect not Egyptian ; for, though proficient in many branches of science ;
in medicine, astronomy, mechanics, chemistry, mathematics ; Egypt had no literature. Nor is it Oriental ; for, with the exception of those hints
in religion and philosophy, to which we have already alluded , the East imparted none of her mental treasures to the ancient Greeks. Even the
Phænicians, the oriental people with whom Greece had the closest and most constant relations, were of no service in this respect. They, too, were devoid of literature beyond the mere rudiments of philosophic spe
culation ; too deeply engrossed with their commercial adventures to yield more than a passing thought to less gainful pursuits. Yet it must not be
forgotten that to them the Greeks were indebted for those means of per
petuating the fruits of intellectual exertion , of which they made such glorious use. Whatever uncertainty may hang about some parts of the legend of Cadmus, there can be no doubt that Greece received the inestimable gift of an alphabet from the shores of Phænicia . '

GREEK LITERATURE. 723
That the practice of writing, however , did not at once become common annong the Grecian tribes, and that the materials of the art were scarce
and costly, was perhaps as fortunate for their first efforts in composition , as it has been for posterity that the art was applied in time to snatch from
the frail tenure of memory, and fix in an enduring shape, the finest monuments of their genius. The mere process of writing might have
impaired that free, flowing, and exuberant character, which probably belonged to their earliest productions, since it is so conspicuously mani fested in the most ancient that still remain. Conjecture guided by
analogy , our only light in examining those distant times, appears to indi cate that from these remains we may correctly infer the nature of preced ing attempts. The mainspring of intellectual exertion among the Greeks
was the same that has acted upon all nations, who have not derived
their literature from imitation ; that joyous activity of mental power which breaks out wherever circumstances allow it to find scope, that desire
to embody thought and feeling in a cognizable shape, and to impress upon
the minds of others a copy of our own, of which original genius is uni

chief means of perpetuating the results of mental labour. It was natural,
too, that religious emotion , as one of the most vivid and universal feelings of man , should be early embodied in the poetry of a simple age. But
those theories are fallacious, which assume that direct addresses to the
gods, or lyric hymns, as parts of a public ritual, were the primary form of poetical composition among the Greeks. It must be remembered that
of their poetry, previous to Homer, we have not even a fragment on which to reason ." Many names , indeed, of more ancient poets are
recorded , and works ascribed to some of the most famous of them are extant at this day : but the spuriousness of these is too manifest to admit of controversy. From Homer alone, and from the portraiture of elder bards, which certain passages of the Homeric poems supply, we must learn the properties of the earliest Grecian minstrelsy. This evidence
makes it plain that religious invocation was but an incidental portion of the minstrel's lay, and that the homage due to the deities was principally paid in a lively exhibition of their characters and adventures, a setting forth of mythological traditions, and a display of that faith which traced the interference of divine agency in every turn of human affairs. In short it is not more certain that poetry was the first form of Grecian lit
erature, than that the very rudiments of that poetry appeared in the
guise of heroic song . For this there was found a rich profusion of ap propriate and inspiring themes ; and the chivalrous propensities of a
people , whose legends abounded in such topics, insured popularity for the strains in which they were recorded . Nor was there any lack of other cir cumstances favourable to the rise and growth of heroic poetry. The pride of chiefs, the spirit of clanship, the love of ancestral distinction,
combined to elicit and reward the skill of those who could gratify passions so vehement. Hence not only Ionia, that seat of the Greeks where the
most brilliant success in this species of composition was attained, but almost every part of the countries possessed by them , resounded with the
voice of minstrels. Absurd as it is to imagine that the contributions of many separate bards could have been blended into poems of such marked
unity and surpassing lustre as the Iliad and Odyssey, it is yet undoubtedly true that the bards were a numerous class . The “ fames of the heroes ,”
such as Achilles chanted to the harp , the Argonautic expedition , the siege of Thebes, the death of Meleager, above all the “ tale of Troy,"

were the most prominent subjects of their lays. By the constant cele
bration of these favourite themes the powers of the Grecian mind were
called out and cherished , the language was improved in copiousness and harmony, and the versification was moulded into an exquisite structure , which no subsequent endeavours were able to excel. Brighter, from
time to time, shone the gleams of creative fancy'; sweeter, and more sweet arose the sounds that were heard in every quarter, until at last came that burst of amazing sweetness, strength , and majesty, which was designed to overpower all previous strains, and to fill the ears of posterity with its own music .
That great authors represent the times in which they flourish is an
opinion commonly advanced and admitted . The proposition is true in relation to those who have taken their subjects from their own times, and so have been induced and enabled to draw from the life a picture of contemporary manners, feelings and events. But it is more generally
true to say that a great author represents the mind of his age ; partly as by
his influence on others he moulds their tastes and understandings to liis personal bent, and still more as his genius empowers him to seize in its
real essence the spirit of the time, to raise it to the highest pitch, to embody it in the most striking forms, and to bequeath for the instruction of future generations an unerring index to the intellectual condition of
Thus, in the poetry of Homer, 1 while we can perceive that he lived on the margin , as it were, of the heroic age,” and that the state of
things and manners around him was in some respects altered from that
which he describes, we recognise withal a sincere though splendid image of the mental attainments, tastes, and tendencies of his Grecian contem

726 HISTORY OF
poraries. What the Greeks knew , thought, felt, loved, admired , despised, hated, twenty -seven centuries ago, may be gathered from his strains as fully and freshly as if there had been no interval between them and our selves. Whatever improvements, and doubtless they were many, he
might make on the language of his countrymen ; or on the compass and variety of that metré, to whose first principles the genius of the tongue
itself must have led in the very dawn of their poetry : such as we find is in his poems we may infer to have been the prevailing style of composition in his day. Such in kind, however inferior in excellence ,was the character of all that Greece could yet show of a literary nature, and had later efforts redeemed from oral recitation a mass of contemporary verse , the sole
change required in alluding to it would have been one of epithet, from the Homeric to the Heroic literature. Nevertheless, in the case of Homer, as in that of all transcendant genius, the powers and properties
of an individual mind are deeply impressed upon his works. There is
much in them which could not, we may be well assured , have emanated
from any other mind. He had all that the minstrels of his age possessed : he had a great deal, to the measure and stature of which they never at tained .
To analyse the qualities of Homer's genius would happily be a super fluous task . No student of general literature is ignorant of these - of his
sublimity and pathos, his tenderness and simplicity, his inexhaustible vigour, that seems to revel in the endless display of prodigious energies.
The universality of his powers is their most astonishing attribute . He is
not great in any one thing ; he is greatest in all things.

Scarcely does it seem necessary to take further notice of that strange theory which denies the individuality of the author of the Iliad , and



GREEK LITERATURE. 727
asserts that, in the age of Solon and Pisistratus, the poem was not merely educed to writing, but was then for the first time compiled out of separate lays into an epic whole . As if a series of national songs could have been brought to cohere with so much smoothness ; or would have evinced such
unity of plot and purpose ; or have been confined to so small a segment
of the Trojan story ; or have given such prominence to a single Thes
salian hero ; or have displayed throughout the characteristics of an identical and inimitable genius ! Under all the shapes, with which
French ignorance and German erudition , have clothed it, this hypothesis is equally untenable ; and those who, while the genuine impulses of feeling and judgment prompt them to reject it, have not sufficient leisure
or learning to examine the matter critically, may rest satisfied that there is no difficulty in the belief of a single author, comparable to the difficulties of the opposite opinion . There may be difficulties upon the one side, but
there are impossibilities upon the other. Intent, like all poets of the school of nature, not upon himself but his subject, Homer has told us nothing of his personal history. All biography that relates to him is of a
fabulous character ; but, holding a steady course between credulity and
scepticism , we may be assured of a few points of primary importance ; to wit, that his name, whatever its etymology , has been rightly transmitted to us ; that his principal residence was in the delicious climate of Ionia ;
and that though he belonged , as a poet, to a class, of which he is the
glorious representative, yet that he excelled, in a high degree, all his brethren , and was as much the light of his own age, as he has been the wonder of those which have succeeded it.1

HISTORY
OF
A more rational question than that above alluded to , was raised even
by some of the ancient critics, as to the other great poem ascribed to Homer. There are certainly some traces in the vocabulary, syntax,
mythology, and manners of the Odyssey, which, compared with those of the Iliad, appear to indicate a later period and a different author . On
the other hand, it is hard to believe that Greece produced two minds, , so kindred in strength and spirit ; not only similar in kind, but equal in

degree ; and perhaps this last consideration should be suffered to outweigh all arguments, however plausible, in favour of a divided authorship.
Moreover, the Return of Ulysses, while it was a natural theme for a bard who had sung the Wrath and Glory of the son of Peleus, necessarily led to
scenes and subjects which may account for the larger portion of the dis crepancies between the poems. At least the interval between them could
not have been wide. They are compositions of the same class. In both
there is the same general cast of thought, language, and versification ; the same attachment to heroic life in all its adventurous varieties ; the
same views of the external world ; the same mellifluous but masculine
forms of speech ; the same flexible harmony and rich cadences of metre. The beauties of the Homeric poems were so striking in themselves, and so well calculated to rivet the national affections of the Greeks, that we
can discover nothing surprising in the great and permanent influence
which they exerted over all subsequent branches of Grecian literature. The marvel is, that this influence should be least perceptible upon the im mediate successor of Homer. The tone and temper of Hesiod’s2 poetry

are marked by a greater difference from his, than even many of the prose compositions which afterwards appeared. The juniority of this poet to
Homer is proved not more by those verbal and metrical peculiarities,
which speak so plainly to the ears of a critical scholar, than by something in the turn of thought and choice of subjects that evinces a further removal from the fountain -heads of natural feeling. We are forced to suppose the
lapse of not less than a century ," from the age of the Iliad and Odyssey to that of the Theogony and the Works and Days. What a change from the deeds of soldiers domesti arrangements and the cultivation of the soil!
from “ moving accidents by flood or field ” to moral precepts and the de tails of celestial genealogy! It seems as if either the era of adventures were gone for ever, or the poet wished it to be so. He would call roving clans and fierce marauders to agriculture, to commerce, to all the
beneficent arts of peace ! We see that the didactic strains of the Works
and Days were meant to unteach the spirit of the heroic times, and to heal the wounds which they had left behind them. Nor is it less evident
that the Theogony, a poem whose authenticity has been rather unreason ably questioned, must have been posterior to the Homeric pictures of the gods. It was in regular sequence that after the bard should come the
system -maker, with an attempt to reduce to order the desultory sallies of
an imagination, which had given its own colouring to every thing that fell within its range. Perhaps, too, since Hesiod belonged, by residence at
least, to a part of European Greece, his breast was imbued with the spirit of that Orphic poetry, of which we have no genuine remains, but which was certainly didactic in its tone, and devoted to the inculcation of ethics and theology. Now the Orphic poetry, together, with the rites of the
Bacchanalian worship, first introduced into Thrace, seem to have taken

hold of the Grecian mind subsequently to the epoch of Homer. A con
templative cast of disposition , clearly discernible in his strains, will like wise serve to explain why Hesiod should have inclined to the mysteries of a symbolical religion, rather than to the more popular and romantic representations of the Homeric muse. The genius of the elder and far
greater poet asserted, however, in this, as in all other points, a decided ascendency. We recognize it already in those Hymns in honour of the deities, commonly called Homeric, which came not, indeed, from Homer
himself, but some of which are probably little later than the age of Hesiod, about eight centuries before the Christian era .
These hymnst form the connecting link between the Epic poetry, which, after being carried to perfection by Homer, ceased for a long period to be successfully cultivated by the Greeks, and those Lyric effusions, under whose shape their inspiration was next bodied forth . The steps of the
transition can be distinctly traced . Even the recitations of Heroic verse had been sustained by a simple musical accompaniment; but the music,
to which the Hymns were sung, was apparently of a more prominent character, and thus led on to that decided influence of the lyre and pipe,
which had so strong an effect upon the metre, style, and whole construc tion of the later poetry. Again, in the Epic narrative, the person of the
minstrel was almost entirely concealed ;but in the Hymns, as in the strains of Hesiod, it became more visible, and so prepared the minds of Grecian
audiences for those explicit revelations of individual feeling, in which Lyric poetry, the poetry of emotion , largely indulges. Through all the
Greek Lyric compositions, whether appearing in odes, in songs, or in the choruses of Tragedy and Comedy, this is the predominant tone. We

GREEK LITERATURE . 733
Pindar : 1 three illustrious names that mark the close of each successive
century from the date of Hesiod, down to that of the Persian war, one of
the most distinguished epochs in the literary history of Greece.
During this long interval of three hundred years, of which the remains are miserably scanty in comparison with its extent and importance, there
occurred many events of vast moment to the progress of Grecian literature. It includes the age of Solon,2 and the reduction of the old heroic min
strelsy to writing, of which the practice had then become current, and the materials abundant. It includes the rise of prose composition in the works
of the early historians , whose chronicles, though but a few fragments
of them survive, appear evidently to have set the example, and paved the
way , for the immortal muses of Herodotus. It embraces, also, the separa tion of the Greek tongue into dialects, ' a thing observable in every language, but rendered most conspicuous in this instance, by the rank of
and value of the several bodies of literature, thus distinguished from each other . It is true that, from the mode in which the ravages of time have operated, the relics of Ionic and Attic literature are by so much the most considerable , as to throw the rest into the shade ; yet the Æolic and
Dorian branches, to judge even from the fragments we possess, maintained an equal elevation , at least during the period now marked out, and until
the culminating star of Athenian genius usurped the sky. While the
heroic times, and those immediately succeeding them , still endured, and
the forms of manners and policy among the Grecian tribes were nearly uniform , there was one general language of composition, somewhat modi fied by circumstances, chiefly of a local nature. Homer on the coasts of
Asia Minor, Hesiod in Bæotia, and other poets in different quarters, em
ployed the same form of their native tongue, diversified in none of its essential characteristics ; and that form was undoubtedly the current speech of their countrymen, so far adapted to the exigencies of versification , and
subjected to such occasional process of extension or elision , as was possible
in the day of no grammars and glossaries, without risk of baulking the comprehension of their hearers. But with the various forms of life and government that followed the decline of the heroic age, there arose simul taneous variations in the language and complexion of Greek poetry , as
well as in its concomitant music and dancing. In accordance with the
simple but flowing rhythm of the Ionians, their compositions were com monly either of a soft, or of a buoyant and brilliant character ; while the
Æolic and Dorian harp resounded in unison with more deep and thril
ling strains, as it was swept by the movements of more impetuous passion . And thus, too, the gradations were fine and gentle by which the heroic verse and diction passed into the chief varieties of Ionian metre, and the peculiarities of the Ionian dialect, finally subsiding into the kindred Attic :
but the changes made by the Doric and Æolian lyrists on the old metrical

OF
canon were abrupt and violent, and their dialects, retaining all the
roughest collocations and inflections of the antique language, sought to re vive or create a diction of the utmost strength and sternness. The
opposite attributes of the two principal races, are strikingly displayed in these differences ; the Ionic elegance and airiness, contrasted with the lofty aspirations and the solemn and earnest disposition of the Dorian tribes .
Little later in its origin than the Lyric poetry of the Greeks, their
Elegiac poetry flowed from the same source, though not by the same channel. Of the metre and language of this style of composition moulded by an easy process out of the Homeric, Tyrtæus ' gave 2 the first example . The stirring war -songs of this poet are conceived in the true spirit of
Homer . They are even marked by a similar prominence of the subject over the person and individual feelings of the author ; and thus differ widely from the martial lays of the troubadours, Bertrand de Born , Ram
baud de Vaqueiras, and other heroes of the Provençal literature, who have
sometimes been compared with him. Allied in tone and temper to the Tyrtæan elegy were the patriotic strains of Callinus : 3 but the instinctive
taste of the Greeks soon confined the elegiac distich to subjects for which it was better suited ; themes of a plaintive, ethical, or domestic character.

preferred , long after the time of Hesiod, for those speculations upon nature , morality , and politics, in which his spirit was partly revived by Solon and his sage contemporaries. From what we know of the seven wise men , that celebrated band which included the Athenian legislator, it is plain
that they were the founders of the school of gnomic poets, for whose sen tentious maxims the elegiac couplet was so well calculated, as to be at
once adopted by them. How far the verses of this complexion, still ex tant under the names of Solon , Theognis, and Phocylides, are authentic , is very questionable ; but there can be no hesitation in admitting them as specimens of the kind of composition , in which these writers exercised their poetical talents.
A single glance at the exquisite remains of Sappho and Simonides is
enough to awaken the wish, keen in proportion to its hopelessness, that time and barbarism had spared a larger share of the Greek lyric and elegiac literature . Fortunate, however, it is, that in the former province we can still point to the strains of at least one immortal poet.

the wreck of all these compositions, nothing has been left unmutilated except forty -five triumphal lays in honour of victors in the public games. Yet it may be believed that time in this respect has not been cruel to the
fame of Pindar. Considering the importance attached , in the eyes

or

.
The most careless reader of these odes must be struck by the excessive admiration of wealth , magnificence, and every species of greatness, to which we have alluded as a characteristic of Pindar's mind. Splendour
was the passion of his soul: splendour of achievement, splendour of re
nown, splendour of station and outward circumstances. His very pride seems to have suggested to him that nothing but splendour was worthy of
his muse. His genius, to use a figure of his own , was the eagle of Jove, that would not be severed from the sceptre and the god. These aristo
cratic predilections, this enthusiastic attachment to munificent monarchs
and chiefs of ancient fame, were in perfect unison with the whole tenor
of his destiny ; born, as he was, in the midst of the Pythian festival, living surrounded by shows of solemn pomp, and dying, as he had lived , in the full blaze of public ceremony, in the centre of a theatre, and while rapt in those emotions of rejoicing sympathy, which such scenes were
sure to awaken in his bosom . To those, however, who may deem apology requisite for the indulgence of so stately a temper, it may be urged in behalf of Pindar, that, as in the case of many remarkable poets, the ah
stract feeling of veneration was predominant in his mental constitution , and that it was called forth not merely by rank and opulence among
mankind, but even more powerfully by the contemplation of the divine attributes. Hence that glow of piety which shines so brightly in his odes, sometimes breaking out in expressions of the deepest awe, or in sublime pictures of deity, and sometimes assuming an aspect of moral beauty, adding force and lustre to the lessons of wisdom . The latter modifica
tion of religious feeling has given birth to some of the noblest passages
in the poetry of Pindar. He was well aware that emotion does not exclude sentiment ; that the ethics of the heart are not less sound than those of the brain ; and that nature is often hurried , in moments of
excitement, into the innermost shrines of truth. But he knew, likewise, that the philoso of such moments is prompt and peremptory ; oracular
not syllogistic ; and this knowledge has secured him from frequently
offending against the general character of lyric song by lengthened trains
of moral reflection . His example, indeed strongly supports a doctrine 30 3



738 HISTORY OF
primarily suggested by the study of the heart itself, that the lyric trans
port should not be abated by many thoughts of a meditative cast ; and that
the middle region , which certain critics have discovered ; that mild and temperate clime in which they place the ethical and philosophic ode ; is properly the province not of lyric but of didactic poetry. No opposition to this doctrine can fairly be grounded upon the strains of moral senti ment, so frequently found in the choral parts of ancient tragedy. For it may be argued that these are the offspring of peculiar circumstances, allowable, on a principle of contrast, as points of repose amid the passions of the drama; that they are, at whatever length delivered, still the dic
tates of a moral sense, brought into sudden energy by the excitement of the moment ; and that, upon the whole, the greater portion of the choric
odes rather abound in glowing portraitures of the objects of sense, in rapid narration , in brief allusions to heroic or divine achievements, in short in all: those brilliant qualities that adorn the verse of Pindar. A rapid
movement, though perfectly consistent with the utmost grace in the transitions, is impressed upon the whole style of this genuine lyrist ; dis
tinguishing on the one hand his bursts of moral feeling from the formality of didactic poetry, and on the other his sketches of incident' or action
from the copiousness of epic narrative. The latter distinction should be especially noted by those , who would understand wherein consists both the resemblance and the difference of heroic and lyric song . Narrative
is a prominent feature of both ; but the narrative of the Epos abounds in
full details, and dwells with lingering fondness upon the minutest parti culars of an action ; whereas the narrative of the Ode is of a summary and
impetuous character, bounding from part to part of a history with unflag
ging vigour, and touching only upon the most salient and striking points. This is the true source of nearly all the obscurity which modern readers, not so well versed as the ancients were in the ground -work of their own heroic legends and family traditions, have to complain of in the writings
of Pindar ; for nothing can be less like his style than the laboured inco herence and affected wildness of many of his imitators, whose faults,
though belonging entirely to themselves, have been unjustly visited upon the name of their master.

coincidence, to have made his first public exhibition a few months before
the Theban lyrist produced the first of his extant odes, of which the date can be ascertained . The name of this great poet marks an era of twofold interest and importance ; the rise of the Athenian dialect and literature, and the commencement of the regular drama. A tendency towards this
most prominent and palpable species of imitative composition is so strik ingly displayed in every development of Grecian intellect, that we are not
surprised to find Aristotle identifying imitation with the very essence of poetry. Nowhere is it shown more evidently than in the most ancient works. Plato does not hesitate to call Homer, in express terms, the
father of Tragedy. But, however strongly the imitative principle might
manifest itself in heroic song, or in other kinds of composition , it was
hardly possible, in rude and boisterous times, for the stately fabric of the theatre to arise. Progressive approximations to this conclusion were made, however, in various parts of Greece, as the habitations of men
became more settled, and greater attention was bestowed upon the culture of peaceful arts and enjoyments. Mimetic performances were gradually
blended with Bacchanalian hymns and other rites of a serious or mirthful
character. On the soil of Attica the first decided step to dramatic exhi bitions was taken by Thespis ;? many improvements were made by his

successor and scholar Phrynicus ;' and at last, under the impulse given by the genius of Æschylus, the migratory wagon and temporary
scaffold were exchanged for a stage ; dialogue was introduced , and by degrees established in due pre- eminence over the lyric effusions of the chorus ; theatrical dress and decoration became sumptuous and effective ;
and tragedy assumed , in shape and in substance, its noblest attributes. Hitherto the art had been in embryo, a mere larva struggling into form ;
now it started up as the finished specimen , perfect in all its members, although hues of beauty and powers of Aight were afterwards added or increased .
Æschylus is a glorious example of the Athenian character in its highest perfection ; genius, patriotism , and valour. The virtues of the soldier
citizen, called forth by the shock of foreign arms, and inflamed by the remembrance of hard -earned triumphs, have given peculiar force to the
poetry of one who had personally shared the dangers of the conflict. It is everywhere the language of a hero, and seems to resound with the
noise of battle . At the same time, the innate propensities of the mind of Æschylus, as well as the emotions naturally excited by the Persian invasion , and by the great part which Athens had sustained in the con test, are to be traced in the daring flights and lofty conceptions of his There was something gigantie in his mental character, that found
congenial elements in the antique mythology and legends of Greece ; in the Titans who combated with Jove, the founders of extinct dynasties, and those deeds and crimes of the olden time, which were magnified by
the mist of intervening ages into features of transcendent greatness or atrocity. That ideal standard, which all poetry erects for itself, since all
poetry has more or less of an ideal tincture in its composition , was clothed
in his imagination, with an aspect of supernatural strength, wisdom , or Hence it is, that beings and faculties of more than mortal mould are so often conjured within the circle of this potent enchanter.
Hence, too, the extravagance and eccentricity of thought and diction,
which have always been pointed out as the chief faults of Æschylus. His metaphors, like the masks of his invention , are exaggerated images ; his
genius, like his actors, bellows through a trumpet. Yet, though fonder
of commanding our wonder than our sympathy, he was not without an
muse .

to have carried Greek tragedy to the highest pitch of perfection , this original principle of structure had a prodigious effect . But he was more
of an artist than Æschylus: he was more happy in the selection and ar rangement of his fables ; and abounds more in the well-wrought interest and striking reverses, which Aristotle instructs us to esteem as the
triumphs of dramatic skill. That these are compatible with a rigid unity of action is sufficiently proved by the manner in which Sophocles has
treated the legend of (Edipus, in the best of all his productions; while the failure of Corneille and of Voltaire, in their several attempts to extend the combinations and improve the conduct of the plot, is perhaps the most
decisive tribute to the ability of the Greek poet in the management of that difficult subject. His general desire to heighten the interest of his
fables is shown by the addition he made to the number of actors, who might be simultaneously brought upon the stage ; an improvement cer tainly copied by Æschylus in the latter part of his career . But, besides
this technical addition to the facilities of the dramatic art, Sophocles was in other respects an improver on the Æschylean model. The ideal
region, in which his imagination loved to expatiate, was different from
that of the elder bard ; peopled not with supernatural terrors and shapes
of colossal magnitude, but with images of perfect majesty, serenity, and beauty. The impress of such lofty and noble contemplations is seen in the almost faultless excellence of his style . It is not wild , unequal, and irregularly grand ; but stately, sober, and elaborate . The few sallies
which he makes in the manner of Æschylus, fail, as imitations often do, by putting on the external shape without the vivifying spirit of the ori ginal. But in these passages the poetry of Sophocles is wandering from
its native channel, along which it usually flows, a mild majestic stream , seldom ruffled by the tempest, seldom breaking in upon its limits, but bearing on its aspect the unquestionable symbols of dignity and power.
With the third of the great tragic writers of Athens the decline of the art at once commenced and was consummated . Active and fertile as

GREEK LITERATURE. 745
standard above humanity was discarded ; but a standard beyond human ity was substituted in its room . In seeking to keep up a tempest of
perpetual agitation, to harrow the weaker feelings of our nature, Euripides showed men as they never show themselves ; he enhanced
voluptuousness and aggravated error . In character, language, costume, and attitude, that Homeric tone of masculine greatness, which had hither to ennobled the stage, disappeared. With this departed likewise the
solemn march and simple evolution of the tragic fable. Their place was supplied by plots perplexed without interest, and fantastic without inge nuity. Nor were these the only faults of the new school. The choric odes though adorned with poetical graces, were but loosely connected with the
business of the scene : the dialogue was disfigured by the quirks of sophistry, and the pomp of rhetorical declamation ; qualities which pro bably contributed to make Euripides so marked an idol of Parisian taste .
Hence , notwithstanding the many merits of this writer as a poet ; his pathos, his tenderness, his love of nature, his insight into the heart of man ; to him must mainly be imputed the ruin of the tragic drama
among the Greeks. His very beauties made him a fatal example. He thought too much of himself, and too little of his subject; the play was bad when the poetry was exquisite ; his aim was occasional effect, rather
than steady and consistent excellence. If his perceptions were keen, his discrimination was not equally acute ; he mistook the coarse, or the
ludicrous, for the simple ; and if he sometimes made little things great,
he more frequently made great things little. In the pathetic , his most successful branch of writing, he is often a plagiarist on his own concep
tions; in ethics he is rarely free from subtlety or petulance : and in
philosophy, content to be always a disciple, and devoid of original power,
he has repeatedly been made the organ of doctrines, whose folly or mis chief he did not understand .
Longinus, who has drawn from the sun a simile to illustrate the differ ences between the Iliad and the Odyssey, might have disc ered a like
illustration of the rise and fall of Grecian tragedy. With Æschylus, it is the dawn of a glorious day, rich in gorgeous colouring and bright promise,
but still battling against the clouds, and thwarted by the morning haze ; with Sophocles, of a mature and steadfast radiance, it glows in the meri
dian ; and with Euripides, its aptest emblem is the setting luminary , beautiful even in decline, and flooding the skies with a softened lustre, but shorn of power and splendour, and soon to be swallowed up in the darkness of night. Into those shades of obscurity it is not necessary to to follow the expiring art.

HISTORY
OF
the classical era as low as the fourth century after Christ. All the lustre
of Greek tragedy vanished with Euripides, and in the latest productions that assumed the title, its very form disappeared .
If it is expedient, when considering the ancient tragedy, to dismiss modern notions of plan and excellence ; it is yet more proper to do so when engaged with the subject of the Greek comic drama. The form of
that species of poetry, especially in its more early and interesting shape,
was very different from the comedy of intrigue which has gained posses sion of most modern stages. Like tragedy, it arose out of the ebullitions
of Bacchanalian festivity. It is probable that Susarion of Megara first
improved the Phallic hymn, a principal portion of the Bacchic ritual, into a farce performed by a chorus, and accompanied by extemporaneous
effusions of raillery and sarcasm . But the Syracusan 2 Epicharmus,3 the contemporary of Æschylus, did for Grecian comedy that which Æschylus effected in the other department of the drama. He changed the loose interlocutions of the Megarian comedy into regular dialogue ;
gave to each exhibition an unbroken fable ; and softened into ridicule the
coarseness of a personal invective. His plots were chiefly of a mythologi cal cast, and the elegance of his style was the more remarkable, when contrasted with the rough buffoonery to which succeeded . Mitigated ,

GREEK LITERATURE .
however, as the scurrility of his predecessors was in the plays of Epi charmus, accurate criticism will detect, in what tradition has recorded
of them , some distinct elements of the Aristophanic comedy. The habit
of burlesquing the tragic style and subjects, to which jealousy of their rising fame probably inclined him , was revived in the incessant parodies in which the Athenian comic writers indulged their humour or their
spleen , those political strokes that seasoned the wit of Epicharmus, were a type, though a faint one, of the perpetual battery which the poet of
Athens was expected to play upon public affairs and public men ; and the invented characters, the fanciful stories, the mixture of seriousness
with jocularity, which marked the Sicilian style, are all features to be recognised anew in such productions as the Wasps, the Birds, and the Clouds of Aristophanes.
The chief alteration made by this great writer and his Athenian pre
decessors on the Syracusan model, was the bringing back, with a loftier aim, but equal or augmented bitterness, the personal satire of the prim itive Phallic songs. They thus stamped upon the Old Comedy a deep indelible impression . It was essentially satirical, and sank at once when its essence was withdrawn . Not that its authors were so simple as to baulk their countrymen of that variety, which in the theatre, as
everywhere else, was dear to the inhabitants of Attica. Many other
ingredients were blended with the predominant one of personal invective. On the slender thread of an inartificial plot were strung together sar casm , ridicule, poetry, wit, humour, politics, parody, and puns. The
old Comedy may want symmetry and order ; it may be deficient as a work of art ; yet as a rich and ready vehicle for the flights of genius, it was congenial to the taste of Athens, and worthy of the illustrious poet, from whose remains we now learn to understand its nature .
Aristophanes' had so high an idea of his function as a dramatist, and

of his own mental powers, that, had regularity of plot, or an ingenious combination of incidents, been required in the structure of the old
comedy, he would certainly have attempted it, and if we may judge even from some scenes of his existing plays, with eminent success. But in
reviewing his productions as a whole, and as specimens of the system to which they belonged , not only the ancient conception of the comic art, but likewise the character of the Bacchanalian festival must be taken into the account. To the more solemn and exalted species of mental inspira

that intoxication of the soul, of which Bacchus was equally the patron ,

GREEK LITERATURE 749
On this principle we easily find a reason for the wildest sallies of buffoon
ery , and a reason too, if not an excuse, for that grossness of language and allusion , which harmonized with the obscene ensign of the original Phallic ceremonies . But, above all, this principle explains to us the general
meagreness or irregularity of the Aristophanic plots. It was impossible often to contend against the humours of the feast. While “ laughter
holding both his sides ” was lord of the ascendant, the poet was ashamed to show himself in earnest. To take anything in earnest was alike foreign
to the disposition of his audience. Thus they tolerated the most vehement
attacks upon their own faults and follies in a collective capacity; and per mitted the comic author to treat their deities, and the religion of the state , with a degree of irreverence, the slightest approach to which , in a writer
of tragedy, was visited with severe animadversion . Aristophanes was not behind his brethren in availing himself of some of these professional im munities ; yet, wherever, amid the coarseness, the grotesqueness, and the mockery of the old comic vein, the personal character of the man breaks out, we see that it was not merely his boast, but his real wish and
aim, to elevate the tone of his art. The graces of his diction no one will
seek to gainsay. He wields the idiomatic powers of the Attic form of speech with a skill unrivaled, except, perhaps, in the dialogues of his admirer Plato . Nor should it be forgotten, that he is at least as much a
poet, as a satirist or a buffoon . Snatches of exquisite poetry are perpetu
ally intermingled with the passages of a more robust or vulgar quality, like glimpses of an Elysian distance descried from some rugged or re volting foreground. When we add to this, that the patriotism of Aristo
phanes was of that sterling ore which shines from its own brightness,
without the adventitious gilding of popular professions, we claim for him the crowning merit of a great mind . The last mentioned excellence ne cessarily involves another that may justly be ascribed to him—a sound consistent view of the philosophy of morals. Even his memorable assault upon Socrates, however erroneous in the choice of an object, or unwar ranted in the extent to which it was carried, must be imputed to no other motive . It was wrong to confound Socrates with the sophists of his day ;
but it was right that the practices and doctrines of the sophists should be exposed' and reprobated with exemplary rigour. Yet the precipitance with which the poet identified a wise and virtuous humourist with the
intellectual empirics around him, has caused his satire, in this instance alone, to recoil upon himself. In all other instances the attacks of Aris
tophanes were as just as they were tremendous ; a fact greatly to the honour of one whose shafts flew, so thick on every side, that he might well
have exclaimed, with a celebrated writer of modern times, “ What public
question have I declined ? what villain have I spared ? ” Such severe, though wholesome discipline, as that which was exercised
by the authors of the old comedy, could coexist with nothing but a state
of absolute liberty. When the free spirit of Athens was extinguished, 3R3

GREEK LITERATURE . 751
great branch of literature had been cultivated by some of the most power ful minds that adorn the Grecian annals, and that have raised prose com . position, in its chief varieties, to a level with the noblest achievements
of poetry. To the earliest Greek chronicles, which prepared the way for regular
history, we have already had occasion to allude. Succeeding, as records of past transactions, to the songs of the mythic age, they had about them
much of the spirit of poetry , which still lingers in the epic plan , the picturesque descriptions, and the untiring flow and fulness of ' Herodo

and natural pathos, are the qualities that render the style of this author so perfect a model of historical composition in the eyes of all who aru
not blinded by false taste, or by attachment to a particular theory. Something, perhaps, of the inexpressible pleasure, with which we dwell upon his pages, is due to the musical forms and idiomatic graces of the Ionic dialect ; employed by him though he was himself a Dorian , either
in deference to the preceding annalists, whose desultory sketches he im proved into an art, or from a deliberate choice, grounded upon its exquisite fitness for the purpose of narration . Even if, in respect of dialect, he was indebted to the example of his predecessors, he left them far behind
him both in excellence of method , and in extent and dignity of subject. His was one of those fertile minds whose energies were summoned forth
by the prodigious crisis of the Persian war ; an event which, though
ushered in by a copious introduction , and surrounded by beautiful epi sodes, yet constitutes the main plot and business of his history. Herodotus has been called the Homer of historical composition ; and he deserves to be so named, not only from a certain affinity with the style and language of the great poet, but from the unity of his design, and its subservience to the renown of his country. Like Homer, too, though well versed in the owledge of human nature and the foundations of ethical science,
he makes no parade of his own sagacity. He suffers persons and events, delineated with graphic minuteness, to speak for themselves. In this, as in other particulars, he displays a true conception of the historian's
office. History is never so enchanting, never so useful, as when it keeps to its native domain.
Every one will wish to believe, though the tradition rests on no very ancient authority, that the public recital by Herodotus of that great work, in its first condition, which for fifty years he continued to enlarge and improve, drew tears of youthfulemulation from the eyes of " Thueydides.

Yet, if the spirit of rivalry were thus roused within him , he at least took care to strike out a new path, as remote as possible from the track already opened up. In many things his manner of viewing and of treat
ing history was perfectly original. Together with the Attic dialect,
which had been only recently adapted to prose composition , but which was suited, by its compact strength and manly tone, to the grave tenor of his subject, he introduced other deviations from the Ionian standard .
While in Herodotus we find the simple majesty, the flexibility, the stately evolution and warm colouring of the heroic epos, Thucydides has all the concentrated interest, the depth, and the gloom of tragedy. Greece, no
longer buoyant on the tides of patriotism and national triumph , but torn hy intestine animosities, the sport of profligate counsels, and about to
sink into the gulf of ruin ; a great people, in their corruption and decline ; and the fall of that Athens, which, in spite of its vices and follies, had
been the boast of the best days of freedom ; such was the melancholy theme with which he chose to moralize his pages. It was a sombre, but
à pregnant subject ; full of striking lessons ; rich in materials for eloquent

If, however, that state- lic avocations, he was left with being the mover ofa separate de ment be correct, Dodwell seems outanyattachments but to simple cree oftheassembly for therecall to have proved the circumstance truth, and proceeded to qualify of Thucydides.

description ; and worthy of the highest elaboration which art cowd be stow. Of these capabilities it would be vain to deny that the historian has made admirable use . But in no instance are the defects, that often
accompany genius of the first rank, more conspicuous. With all his
dramatic power , and vivid represention of separate scenes, Thucydides is
not happy in the general arrangement of his topics. His style is dark ened by a studied obscurity, that too frequently converts eloquence into
the appearance of conceit. Above all, the spirit of philosophizing has infected too large a portion of his work . In the harangues, which he
puts into the mouths,of his personages, and the reflexions which he makes upon events, we often detect a metaphysical subtlety, diving too deep for the truth . The example thus set has been eminently unfortu nate : it has operated more or less upon all subsequent historians, opening a wide door for partiality and prejudice, and changing, in many cases,
the art of animated and impressive narrative into that of mere specula tion .

why, in general estimation , Xenophon should be ranked below Thucy dides, as well as below the historian of Halicarnassus ? It seems that
for this inferiority his subjects must be chiefly accountable. They are deficient either in unity and grandeur, or in compass and importance. The conclusion and results of the Peloponnesian war, detailed in his Hellenic Annals, present not so fine a field as the causes and course of that great moral and political revolution' which Thucydides traced out in its operation upon all parts of Greece : and the brilliant adventures, portrayed in the Anabasis, though they blend the dignity of truth with
the interest of fiction , and may even be connected, by some visible rela tions, with subsequent events of the highest moment, have of themselves
the air of a mere episode in history. But, in addition to this, it cannot
be disguised that the masculine energy and weight of Thucydides, as a political reasoner, by no means revive in the parallel passages of Xenophon . Notwithstanding his grace, his perspicuity, and his tenderness, the intel lectual achievements of the latter furnish a proof that he who passes, in
too ambitious a career , from province to province of literature, must not hope to erect in any the trophies of supreme dominion. For it is in many different capacities that Xenophon must be viewed, in order to comprehend his whole character ; and in all he has associated
his name with the art of composition. Not to mention his writings as a statist, an economist, and a sportsman, the works next in value to his historical productions, are those in which he skims the surface of the Socratic philosophy, and draws a picture of its founder. Thus he forms, in his own person, a link between the literature of Greek history, and
the literature of Greek philosophy ; a subject far better treated by him , where he makes Socrates directly his hero, than where, in the province
of historical romance, to which the Cyropædia belongs, he mixes up Grecian tenets as well as Grecian manners, with elements of a heteroge neous description.
With the peculiar systems of the various schools, into which the phi losophers of Greece were divided, we have here no concern. This sketch
can embrace only the prominent characteristics of the few great men, whose genius has given to the speculations of science a place in the most beautiful of all bodies of literature. It has been previously remarked,
that the first regular seeds of Grecian philosophy lie scattered amid the poetry of Hesiod ; and that the poetical medium long continued to be that through which its maxims were conveyed. But many of the most celebrated among the elder sages declined the honours of authorship ; a
fact, perhaps, not much to be regretted, at least if we are to suppose that their style would not have excelled their doctrines. Look to whatever side we please, if we except a few gleams of truth, and a few gnomic precepts of moral or political sagacity, there is little in what we know of
the ancient schools, Ionian, Pythagorean, or Eleatic, to impress us with a high degree of veneration . Everywhere we see them lost in physical

theories, that run into materialism, or in visionary metaphysics, that cannot be said “ to call for aid on sense . To the instability of their
principles, the uncertainty of their deductions, and a sort of mental re finement, perfectly compatible with gross corruption of manners, which grew out of their speculative exercises, and gradually cast its sickly hues over the manly lineaments of the old Greek character, must be traced the rise of the Sophists, that dangerous tribe, who flocked from many quarters to Athens, about the period of the Peloponnesian war, and whose history powerfully demonstrates, that errors of opinion must end at last in practical mischief. A show of universal knowledge, a dextrous per
version of the dialectical art, and a jingle of antitheses, that sounded like
oratory to undiscriminating ears, were the chief weapons of this pestilen tial race, who were unhappily allowed to poison the sacred sources of edu cation, and whose influence on the acute but fickle minds of the Athenian youth threatened the utter subversion of truth . But the excess of the
evil wrought its own cure, The activity, the success , and the ostenta
tion of the Sophists, stung into vigorous antagonism an intellect as subtle
as their own, capable of wielding the same arms, but with a more potent energy , and a better aim . Socrates ? entered the controversial arena ,

complete and glorious a revolution in the Greek philosophy. While Socrates purified the spirit and corrected the tendency of phi losophical researches ; while he even laid, by the hands of his disciples,
the foundations of systematic speculation ; he himself wrote nothing.
Yet his colloquial lessons, preserved by that affectionate enthusiasm , which his virtues kindled, and his very eccentricities helped to keep alike, gave birth to the branch of literature, that numbers among its foremost names those of Xenophon and Plato. In the pages of Xenophon we find a lively sketch of the Socratic ethics, and noble views of natural
religion, which have almost exhausted that province of argument ; but
there is a want of depth and of completeness on the more abstruse points of metaphysics, which is somewhat unsatisfactory when compared with

the fine essence of poetry ; attempts, from which his own sagacity, or the advice of his great master, speedily diverted him ; he did not waste his fire on other pursuits. Without being a methodical writer, he had
an intellect too discerning and too accurate to leave mental science as vague and undefined as he found it. He shadowed out its chief divisions,
and their mutual dependencies ; and was a benefactor to philosophy even
with regard to form . But much more did he benefit philosophy by the light and glory which his genius flung around every topic' it embraced,

760 HISTORY OF
distorted or exaggerated the views of Socrates ; the mysticism into which he is prone to dream himself away ; the folly of some of his politi
cal reveries ; the perverseness of some of his ethical doctrines ; all is forgiven, as we smile or sigh beneath the spells of this mighty wizard.
The shape into which he has thrown his productions; that shape of dia logue which, as managed by him, appears so easy and delightful, that it requires the repeated failures of other writers to demonstrate its intrinsic
difficulty ; afforded room for every grace of composition, from the smart ness of dramatic retort, to the flow of copious dissertation ; and in Plato
every grace is found. His style appears to possess a principle of self adaptation, by which it responds, with miraculous facility, to each varied
mood of sentiment and passion. He is at once a satirist, a rhetorician, a critic, a fabulist, and, when he pleases, a sophist. We follow him with admiration through all his changes ; we are charmed with him under all aspects ; but most, perhaps, in those introductory or incidental passages
of narrative or description, wherein he combines the skill of a consum mate artist with the rich and eloquent enthusiasm of a devout lover of the beautiful.
To this vein of mingled fancy and reason ; to this Proteus-like pliancy of style ; to this profusion of picturesque and glowing imagery ; the strongest of all possible contrasts is seen in the works of him, who has
exerted, and down to the present hour continues to exert, an influence
commensurate with that of Plato upon the whole fabric of philosophy. Were it not that there is somewhat of a kindred spirit in the acuteness
and dexterity with which both wield the weapon of analysis ; that there is an agreement in many of their fundamental doctrines, and their ab
stract principles of taste ; and that a sort of filial tenderness perceptibly moderates the tone of the pupil when alluding to his master ; it would be impossible to believe that · Aristotle & was for twenty years the dis

HISTORY
OF
assigned to philosophy, and in the proposed end and object of some of its
branches, the chief of the Peripatetics places himself in decided opposi. tion to the founder of the Academy. With him commenced that way
between empiricism and rationalism , as they are technically called , which has raged ever since. But in style the difference of the two leaders is perhaps most deeply marked ; and certainly not to the advantage of Aristotle. The fair and flowing stream of Plato's eloquence seems to
have sunk without effect into the arid texture of his pupil's mind. A
contempt of the flowers of diction, a resolute rejection of ornament, are
the prominent features of the Aristotelian style. It is so dry as to ap
proach the confines of dulness ; so elliptical as frequently to border on the enigmatic. Moreover, it wants the easy command of idiomatic
phraseology, the genuine Atticism with which Plato captivates his
readers. We detect in it decided traces of that corruption of the Athe nian dialect, which dates from the era of Alexander, and are already
called upon to mourn over the decay of the noblest vehicle ever invented for the thoughts of man . Yet Aristotle, in spite of all the faults that may be imputed to him, is great even as a writer. Austere and tuneless
as his composition is, it is so pregnant with thought, so “ instinct with spirit,” and sometimes so enlivened by a true feeling of the lofty or the tender, that it seldom fails to rouse the attention or to interest the heart. Nor is he altogether devoid of a certain touch of humour, not
transgressing the bounds of philosophic decorum ; a mixture of slyness and apparent simplicity ; that has a poignant effect when he chooses to
display it. Amid his multifarious productions the best specimens of his
literary powers are those most universally known ; that ethical treatise, which , through a veil some perplexity and self-contradiction, discloses
so many glimpses of truth ; that inestimable work on rhetoric, which is
still the manual of the art of persuasion ; that code of the laws of poetry,
which, though but a mutilated fragment, embraces all the principles of just criticism, and the germs of the most popular and brilliant theories
that, from time to time, have enriched the philosophy of taste . Within the compass of the classical age of Greek composition , the
literature of philosophy presents no other prominent points .

standing the high rewards of eloquence, which the constitution of that '
state held forth , it was long before eloquence was cultivated , within her bosom as a regular art. The elder Athenian statesmen , even those
most famed for their success in the assemblies of the people, seem to have studied little how to insure or to heighten the effect of their natural talents. Perhaps the speeches, which the character of ancient
history allowed to be intermingled with the narrative, and in which it
was the evident aim of some historical writers to display the full force
of their political and historical abilities, supplied the earliest evidence of the magnificent results attainable by assiduous care and elaborate
preparation . Then eloquence arose as an art and a branch of instruction ,
Schools for the inculcation of its principles were opened at Athens, and
no price was thought too high for the lessons of an eminent professor. It cannot be denied that the influence of this methodical training was not always fortunate. Thus it would have been better for Isocrates, had he
never imbibed an affected prettiness and a finical modulation from the example and the rules of Gorgias. But it is equally undeniable that by
such scholastic discipline, and by private toils and trials, too arduous and unremitting for modern impatience to undergo, was matured that
perfection of style, proof, in its intrinsic strength and beauty, against all changes of manners, times, and circumstances, which still astonishes and awes the mind in the pages of Demosthenes.? Out of the list of

gumentative, so plausible, and so powerful withal, that it is difficult to
imagine him prostrated at the feet of a victorious rival; it is not of any, nor of all of these, that we are understood to speak, but of the great
luminary that eclipsed every other light, and shines in unapproachable splendour. The striking fact that in Demosthenes we find the only consummate orator that Athens herself ever produced, may impress
upon us the extreme difficulty of the art which he practised. Greece
can boast an array of five or six illustrious poets, of three great historians, of at least two philosophers who take a high place in literature ; but she hias only one Demosthenes. This eulogium will not be condemned as extravagant by those who have studied with all the attention , which such works deserve to have bestowed on them , the series of his political
speeches ; the attacks upon Philip , and defences of his own administra
tion , summed up and carried to the loftiest pitch of conceivable ex cellence, in the wonderful oration on the crown. For the complete
enjoyment of this master-piece of eloquence an essential prefıration is
the perusal of the great speech of the accuser ; that admirable effort, which for a moment seems to raise Æschines almost to the Demosthenean level, and must extort from every one the question, " how could this be
answered or evaded ? ” But a mere glance at the reply of Demosthenes
at once explains the defeat of his opponent. What power! what art ! what nature ! what elaboration ! A heathen need not have scrupled to
exclaim , that to purchase the glory of this matchless triumph it would have been worth while to live the life of Demosthenes, and to die his death ! When Alexander , after the destruction of Thebes, demanded the surrender of the Athenian orators, he showed at once his hatred of
liberty, and his clear perception of the means that had mosi effectually sustained it. This act was far from inconsistent with the spirit in
which , amid the horrors of an exterminating conquest, he had spared the dwelling and the descendants of Pindar. He intended a death -blow to Greek oratory ; but he held himself forth as delighted to cherish and
reward all less dangerous manifestations of intellect ; and the declension

of literature, which was one of the most signal results of his ambitious
career, was at the same time a severe and a fult' retribution for his po litical crimes. Well might he sigh in vain for a great pset to celebrate his exploits ; he, who by his own deeds had trampled out the fires of
genius, and polluted the true sources of fancy and natural emotion. We
mark with regret, but without surprise, the change that, from the period
of his ascendency, began to affect the various developments of the Grecian mind. Eloquence died away in the sickly languor of Oriental affectation . History seeming to catch its tone from the extravagant projects and romantic adventures of the conqueror , became a tissue of
bombast, compliment, and fable. Science, indeed, flourished in many
of its branches ; for science does not scorn the patronage of despotism, and often requites its munificence by aiding its designs ; but all the
charms of the art of composition , whose noblest efforts have ever sprung from the impulse of unfettered minds, fled with the extinction of free dom .
The victorious sword of Alexander opened a way, however, for the diffusion of Greek literature over half the globe, and carried a know ledge of its attractions to the very confines of China. But, though it
lingered long in different quarters, it was in Egypt that the principal effort was made, after the death of the Macedonian prince, to form a new focus of letters and mental refinement. All influences were
brought together, that could contribute to make Alexandria be, what
Athens had been, the capital of the intellectual world ; all, except the
presence of those Muses, who could not be compelled to migrate from the clime of their birth. The liberal dynasty of the Ptolemies encour
aged learning and learned men ; collected libraries ; founded universi
ties ; and was repaid by the too frequent produce of such institutions. The new Greek literature was the literature of courtiers and grammarians.
Even the Alexandrian poetry, the most favourable side on which that literature can be viewed, is the poetry of art and labour, not of nature . Let Apollonius! Rhodius 2 be selected as perhaps the best specimen of

neatness and smoothness had become the characteristics of Greek poetry , and when its choicest productions were fit only to bloom in an anthology. **
To complete the sketch of literary history in classical times, it is ne cessary only to notice the after- growth of Grecian literature , long posterior
to the Alexandrian epoch , in which some of the raciness of ancient genius seemed to be renewed . Even during the height of Roman ascen dency, the Greek intellect had not failed to yield symptoms of life.

and a warrior, by the calm and masculine tone of his narrative, deserved
the applause of all cultivated ages, and the fame of a great political teacher. It is his style alone that condemns him to a subaltern rank in literature. In it we certainly detect a wide departure from pure Atti cism, an admixture of Macedonian words and terminations, aggravated
by the adoption of forms and inflections from the poets, and of technical phrases from the school of Aristotle. Yet so much was his work admired ,
that, with a few exceptions, it was chosen as the model, both in matter and composition , by subsequent historians. To the acuteness and sound
ness of the matter, however, the majority of them made no near approach, while they fell even below the level of the style. They displayed more

THE
MANNERS AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE SPARTANS .
BY THE EDITOR .
The distinguished station which Sparta occupied in Greece, renders it necessary that some notice should be taken in this place of its manners
and institutions, especially as they differed so widely from those of the other states.
THE
CITY
.
The city itself, unlike its rival Athens, could pretend to little beauty, In its form it was irregular, as if it consisted merely of a group of villa ges ; its public buildings were few , and the most of them inelegant; and
its general appearance, as Thucydides observes, was far from conveying a just idea of its importance . Almost the only structures of any note
were the lonxian, a range of galleries decorated with fine fresco paintings, and the Tegorin otod, a portico, built in commemoration of the victory at Platæa. This building was in the aroga, where it formed a very con
spicuous object. Beside it stood the senate -house and other public offices. The IIA&Tavotas served as an approach to the enclosure in which the
youth practised their gymnastic exercises. It was so called from the plane-trees with which it was shaded . On an eminence, within the pre
cincts of the city, rose the temple of Minerva, Xanx101xos , built of brass, whence it had its name. This was the asylum in which Pausanias
took refuge, and perished . The height itself on which it stood, was termed the Acropolis, not from being fortified , but merely on account of its elevation. Sparta, indeed , had no citadel like that of Thebes or Athens ; neither was it surrounded by walls, a prohibition to that effect, having been laid down by Lycurgus, probably that the citizens might

thereby learn to regard their own valour as the only means of security.
During eight centuries it had no other bulwark , nor did it require any other till it had lost its independence.
CLASSES OF THE PEOPLE,
9
One of the most striking features of the Spartan constitution was the equal division of property which it established . Lycurgus marked out the whole territory of Lacedæmon into thirty thousand portions, which he assigned to as many families - nine thousand to the Spartans, and the rest to the people of the country . The former, who were of Doric origin , were called EnapTiaraı; the latter, who were Achæans, and had inhabited
the city previous to the Dorians, by whom they were dispossessed, were called Thegioixos. He farther passed a law , fixing the number of citizens at that of the lots of land. To prevent the population from falling short
of this amount, marriage was enjoined on all, public ridicule was incurred by all who abstained from it, and certain immunities were offered to those who had several children . When there was an excess, it was
obliged to emigrate. These lots could neither be bought nor sold, but descended unalienably from father to son. If there was no son, the in
heritance passed to the daughter ; and if there was no issue at all, it reverted to the state. Had he allowed these lands, however, to be tilled by their respective owners, he foresaw that a greater or less degree of cultivation would soon have given rise to a difference of value. To pre
vent equality from being in this way destroyed, they were consigned into
the hands of bondsmen , who were permitted, after allowing the proprietor a fixed portion of the produce, to retain the remainder to themselves.
As the quantity required of them was only a small portion of what was
raised , the slaves in Lacedæmon were in general more opulent than their masters.
At Sparta, as in every Dorian state , there were three tribes, Hylleis, Dymanes, and Pamphyli, which were farther subdivided into thirty ißen,
clans. The pogues were six divisions, including all who were capable of bearing arms. There was likewise another class called yobazes, composed
of strangers and slaves, who, having been trained up from infancy along
with the Spartan youth, received some of the privileges of citizenship. In early times this honour was often conferred gratuitously ; but with the increase of population, this became less frequent. Almost the only distinction of rank among the citizens was that between the ómovos, or equals, and the 'Rolstoves, or inferiors ; but in what this distinction consisted, is not clearly ascertained. It appears, however,
that although it was hereditary, a person might be removed from the one
class to the other as a punishment or reward ; and likewise, that a removal from the higher to the lower was the special penalty incurred by those who did not give up their children to be educated as the laws required . This degradation fell also on the children .



OF THE SPARTANS. 777
But the great distinction of rank was that between the free population and the 'EJAWTES, or slaves, so called, according to Müller, from law, in a passive sense, as a general term for prisoners of war. These slaves
were much more numerous than the Lacedæmonians themselves, being
in the proportion of at least five to one. The purposes for which they
were employed were extremely various. They tilled the land, practised the arts, waited at the public entertainments , attended the heavy armed troops on land, and served as sailors in the navy . In short, they relieved their masters from every kind of labour, except that of the gymnasium or the camp. But notwithstanding the services they rendered, their
treatment was far from kind . They were reminded from time to time,
by blows and insults, of their degraded condition ; they were forbidden to use the Spartan songs, because they breathed sentiments of liberty ; and they were even forced to intoxicate themselves, and perform in that
state licentious dances, in order that the disgust which they thus excited might operate on the citizens as an antidote to intemperance. It is
generally understood, too, that they were exposed to a yearly massacre, the xqurtula , instituted as an exercise in stratagem for the youth ; but it
is more probable, as Müller suggests, that this was only a species of very severe labour. But be this as it may, it is certain that in dangerous cir cumstances, when their vast number made them formidable, and the
cruel usage which they experienced gave reason to suspect their fidelity, many of them were secretly destroyed. It affords some slight alleviation
to the dark light in which this presents the Spartan character, that these unhappy beings were not hopelessly retained in bondage, but were some times emancipated for their services. This was a power which belonged exclusively to the state .
The
administration
was
distributed
among
three
powers
,
viz
.
,
kings
,
senate
,
and
people
;
in
this
way

a
union

THE KINGS.
When
the
Dorians
and
Heraclidæ
took
possession
of
the
Peloponnese
,
the
crown
of
Sparta
fell
to
the
share
of
Aristodemus
;

prince

left
at
his
demise

,
between
whom
the
question

could

arose

conjointly.
These
two
dynasties
were
the
Agidæ
and
Eurytionidæ
.
Although
this
distribution
of
the
royal
power
was
often
the
cause
of
strife
between
the
sovereigns
them
selves
,
yet
its
tendency
was
rather
salutary
than
otherwise
,
as
their
mu
tual
jealousy
kept
them
from
making
any
attempt
on
the
other
branches
of
the
legislature
;
and
it
was
perhaps
partly
on
this
account
that
no
al
teration
in
this
respect
was
made
by
Lycurgus
.

religion , and the right of presiding in the senate. In war, however, it
was much increased . He took command of the army by right of birth ; he had the entire direction of its movements, the power of life and death,
of raising supplies in foreign countries, and receiving embassies. In short, his authority was all but absolute. A council indeed was appointed to attend him, but he might deliberate with it or not at pleasure. When
he returned , however, his conduct was liable to review , and if it was dis approved of, he might be censured or suspended . This was sometimes done even without a specific charge. Every nine years the Ephori were authorized to go out into the fields in a calm mooniess night, and if a shooting star, which was regarded as a sign of the divine displeasure, was observed, he was immediately deposed. He could be reinstated
again only by the interposition of the Delphic oracle .
Among a people so very much opposed to riches, the king's revenue could not have been great ; still it was more than sufficient for the decent maintenance of the royal dignity. The sources whence it arose were cer
tain lands in the territory of the legionoi, a part of the Spartan lands, and a large share of the military spoils. He was also entitled to a double
allowance (dotadoir) at entertainments, and victims, wheat, and wine, for sacrifices. As the lineal descendant of Hercules, and the minister of re
ligion, he was always treated with respect. He enjoyed the first place in
public ( agosogice); on his entrance all but the Ephori rose up ; in the field he was followed by three hundred chosen warriors, as a retinue ; and his decease called forth the most violent lamentations.
THE
SENATE
.
The supreme deliberative body at Sparta was the senate , composed of the two kings, and twenty -eight old men chosen by the people. Owing to the advanced years of these representatives, it was called ysgwa , or yegovora . A place in this council was the highest honour to which a Spartan could aspire ; and as no one could become a candidate for admis
sion before the age of sixty, the hope of it exerted on all during life the
most salutary influence in deterring from what was base, and inciting to virtuous exertion . The mode of election was somewhat singular. When a vacancy occurred, several persons were shut up in an edifice near the place of meeting, from which they could obtain no view of what was going The candidates were then led along in succession , amid the acelama tions of the assembly, and the choice fell on the individual who was de clared by the judges in the adjoining building to have been most clamor ously received. After this contest, which was called vixneugier ons agstas ,
the trial of merit, the victor was conducted in triumph , by crowds cele
brating his virtues, to the temples, where, with a garland on his head ,
he offered up incense. A variety of ceremonies followed , after which he took his seat in the senate .

addition to all questions of state which came primarily under its consider
ation , it also decided in cases affecting the life or character of a citizen ; and hence, in allusion to their twofold functions, its members are styled
κυριοι και δεσποται της πολεως, and κυριοι μεγαλων κρισεων.
THE EPHORI .
The chief executive power at Sparta was exercised by magistrates, called Epogos, a name expressive of the object for which they were created
—the guardianship of the public interest. The number of these magis trates, as of the tribunes at Rome, who greatly resembled them , was five,
the first of whom , from giving his name to the Lacedæmonian year , was styled επωνυμος.. They were chosen at the public assembly from the
people indiscriminately, the only requisite qualification being that they belonged to the op010 . The term for which they held office was a year. Once a month during this period they took an oath to support the royal authority, so long as it continued constitutional.
Their duties were various. They attended daily at their hall (agxshov) in the forum , where, on their seats of office (do @ ga spopixe ), they gave
judgment in civil causes. They superintended the games and festivals. They had the peculiar charge of the youth, whom they inspected every ten days, to see that they were not brought up with too much delicacy. On such occasions they were expected to make use of the most efficient means to inspire them with emulation . They further took cognizance of
any breach of public morals, awarding punishment not only in the case of positive crimes, but even for indolence or pusillanimity. They had also
the inspection of the inferior magistrates, and the power of punishing them for misconduct. Two of their number always accompanied the
general in war, as spies upon his actions. If they observed any thing amiss, they could summon him, on his return , for trial before the people, and obtain a sentence of censure or dethronement. They also summoned the popular assemblies, proposed the subject of deliberation , and carried the resolutions into effect. In addition to this share in the internal gov ernment of the state, they had also the chief direction of its foreign policy. To them exclusively belonged the right of receiving embassies, of raising levies, of providing for their maintenance, and fixing their destination . Even in the field, notwithstanding the full powers with which the general
was invested, they sometimes interposed to direct his movements, and, as in the instance of Agesilaus, to recall him in the midst of his opera tions.
And yet, of the manner in which they exercised power of such exorbi tant extent, the Ephori could not be called to render an account. . This want of responsibility, however, does not appear to have been abused ; for
as they returned, at the expiry of their office, to the rank of private citi zens, they could have no object to divert them from the only interest which a Spartan recognised-- that of the constitution . That they were actually



780
MANNERS
AND
INSTITUTIONS
faithful to this interest, is evinced by the universal respect which they commanded , not only while the spirit of the ancient institutions continued
to animate the people, but even when they were far sunk in degeneracy.
PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES .
The principal assembly which met at Sparta was that emphatically termed the ixxanove This assembly was composed of deputies from the people of Laconia , of the kings, the senators, the magistrates, and ambas sadors from the allies. It was convened preparatory to engaging in any important enterprise, but not so much with a view to deliberate on the
expediency of the measure, as merely to procure for it the sanction and support of the country. And hence the chief business of this assembly in
the case of a war, was merely to fix the amount of supplies which each district should contribute .
The other assembly, which was designated {xxanoiae peixga , was com posed entirely of citizens. It was held originally without the city, in an open space , between the river Cnacion or Oeneus, and the bridge Babza ; but afterwards a building named oxins was built for the purpose. The ordinary time of holding it was once a month , at full moon ; and it also met occasionally incidental business.
At this assembly every Spartan who had reached the age of thirty en joyed the right of being present, and taking a part. To be heard, how
ever, with attention , it was requisite that his character should be irre proachable.
The usual speakers were the kings, the senators, and the Ephori ; the latter of whom proposed the subject of deliberation , and took the sense of the meeting. This was not done by taking votes, as at Athens, but by acclamation -- κρινουσι βοη και ου ψηφω ; and when the strength of parties
could not be determined in this way, they were separated and counted . In this assembly the people did not possess the right of originating any
measure, but only of confirming or negativing those submitted to them by the senate. Proposals were made at various times to shake off this depen dence, but the majority always chose rather to acquiesce in it than alter the constitution .
MAGISTRATES AND OFFICERS.
After the Ephori, the chief of these were , 1 , the Bridico, five in num
ber, who presided at the contests of the youth, particularly those held in the Πλατανιστας .. The office of these magistrates stood in the forum .
2, The NoroQuraxes, whose duty it was to see that the laws were en forced. 3, The 'Aguorurol, who had the inspection of the public manners
in general, but especially those of the women in this department of their duty , corresponding with the Athenian Tuvosxorpo.. These magistrates had the direction of the female exercises . 4, The Tubos, who were em
ployed to consult the oracle on matters of public concern . They were



OF THE SPARTANS. 781
appointed by the kings, with whom they had the privilege of supping at
the same table. 5, The Algodonos, or guardian of a prince during his mii nority . This officer was generally the next in succession , and while his
charge lasted , he enjoyed all the powers of royalty. 6, The Ilocidovopeos, or superintendent of the youth. This officer was always elected from among the most virtuous of the citizens. He had several young men
under him , who went by the same name. 7, The Agrootas, of whom there were two kinds. The first was a single magistrate, who was created
only in emergencies, for which the ordinary magistrates were unequal , and, like the Roman dictator, was superior to the laws. The second were elected annually, as governors of provinces, and generals of the allies.
8, The Toaspiagxou, officers who commanded under the king in war, and,
when in the city, had the charge of the public acts, arms, and military
exercises. 9, The ' Ismeygerai, three officers, who were placed over the heavy -armed troops, and had the appointment of the dogades, a band of
three hundred , selected as the bravest of the citizens. 10, The Ilgogivos,
magistrates appointed to take charge of strangers. These strangers were such as came on business of state ; for by the law ğsurihaosa , none but
such were allowed to enter Laconia, unless by a special order from the Ephori. The design of this interdict was to prevent the rigour of the Spartan manners from being softened by intercourse with foreigners ; and hence even the few who were admitted had to conform during their stay
to the frugal mode of living which the laws enjoined.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
The judicial power at Sparta was vested in different hands. The
senate decided in criminal cases ; the Ephori in such as regarded pro
perty, or the conduct of other magistrates ; and the kings in causes of heiresses and adoptions. Disputes were also sometimes settled by arbi tration . As there were no advocates at Sparta , the action was conducted
in private cases by the parties themselves ; but in criminal ones , it ap
pears that the circumstances were merely communicated to a magistrate, and brought by him under the notice of the senate . The laws which regulated the decision were committed , not to writing, but to the memory.
PUNISHMENTS .
These were of various kinds. 1 , Znpesce, a fine in money or property ;
unless in the case of kings and generals, this was very small, for the most part nothing more than a cake or a few laurel leaves. 2, A tipesce,infamy.
The severest form of this punishment was that inflicted on those who fled from battle. Such persons could fill no public office, or associate with their fellow citizens, or dwell in the same part of the city, but were marked out by various painful distinctions for the public contempt. A
lighter species of ignominy was incurred by the dissolute and slothful.
3, Buyn. This was not so much a punishment as a voluntary withdrawal 3u

by

as
the

kind
of
punishment,
or
as
at
all
equal
to
an
existence
prolonged
in
infamy.
It
was
usually
inflicted
by
strangulation
,
and
always
in

Besides
these,

were
also

EDUCATION
OF
THE
YOUTH
.
As
it
was
the
main
object
of
the
Spartan
legislator
to
give
to
his
country
a
robust
and
temperate
people
,
so
the
provisions
which
he
made
were
eminently
calculated
to
effect
it
.
As
soon
as
a
child
was
born
,
it
was
carried
for
inspection
to
the
seniors
of
the
tribe,
and
if
it
appeared
sickly
or
deformed
it
was
at
once
destroyed
.
If
,
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
approved
of
,
it
was
sent
back
to
the
parent's
house
,
to
be
reared
up
in
such
a
way
as
would
give
the
fullest
development
to
all
its
powers,
and
lay
the
foundation
of
a
bold
and
patient
character.
On
reaching
the
seventh
year,
he
was
removed
to
one
of
the
public
classes
(
aysła
),
where
he
was
taught
exercises
,
suited
to
his
strength
,
and
gradually
inured
to
cold
,
hunger,
and
fatigue.
After
the
twelfth
year
,
the
exercises
became
much
more
severe
.
About
the
age
of
sixteen
,
he
was
numbered
among
the
σιδευναι
..
At
eighteen
he
passed
from
this
class
into
that
of
the
lonßos,
and
thence,
two
years
after,
into
that
of
the
sigEvÉS
;
the
discipline
continuing
to
grow
more
and
more
arduous
as
he
advanced
,
until
he
be
became
one
of
the
ignßos,
and
a
franchised
citizen
.
Even
then
,
however
,
gymnastic
exercises
were
his
chief
employment.
Up
to
this
period,
the
whole
youth
,
both
male
and
female
,
contended
daily
in
running
,
leaping,
wrestling
,
and
throwing
the
javelin
.
The
former
were
also
frequently
exercised
in
the
chase
,
and
made
to
pass
whole
nights
uncovered
in
the
fields.
Any
carelessness
or
delinquency,
any
foolish
answer
or
remark
,
was
punished
with
the
whip.
They
were
farther
required
to
be
modest
in
their
deportment
to
pay
the
greatest
deference
,
not
only
to
their
regular
masters,
but
likewise
to
all
the
citizens
to
submit
patiently
to
be
rebuked
by
any
of
them
,
or
directed
,
or
chastised
.
To
the
efficacy
of
this
system
in
fitting
the
Spartans
for
war
all
writers
concur
in
bearing
testimony
;
nor
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
this
was
the
great
cause
of
their
eminent
success
.
.
PUBLIC
ENTERTAINMENTS
.
In
order
that
the
effect
of
this
discipline
might
not
be
counteracted
by
luxurious
living,
all
the
citizens
were
obliged
to
sup
in
public
,
where
care
was
taken
that
nothing
should
be
served
up
but
the
simplest
and
coarsest
food
.
From
their
spareness
,
these
entertainments
were
called
Qidotice.
This
food
,
however
,
was
not
provided
by
the
government,
as
in
Crete
,
but
by
the
guests
themselves,
each
being
required

a
certain
amount
of

,

At
these
entertainments
,
citizens
and
magistrates
sat
down
together
;
nor
could
any
one
be
absent
without
incurring
the
censure
of
the
Ephori
.
An
excuse
,
however
,
was
sustained
if
the
person
had
been
engaged
in
sacrifice
or
the
chase
,
only
he
was
expected
to
send
a
share
of
the
game
or
victim
to
his
companions
.
In
order
to
be
admitted
to
a
particular
table
,
it
was
necessary
that
the
applicant
should
be
agreeable
to
all
the
guests
.
To
ascertain
this
,
a
vessel
was
carried
round
into
which
each
dropped
a
crumb
of
bread
;
if
he
was
favourable
to
the
suit
,
this
crumb
was
round
;
if
not
,
it
was
flattened
,
and
a
single
crumb
of
this
latter
sort
was
sufficient
to
exclude
.
This
vessel
was
called
xaddos
,
hence
xixaddiolas
,
to
be
rejected
.
The
youth
were
admitted
to
these
enter
tainments
,
that
they
might
be
instructed
by
the
conversation
,
which
usually
turned
on
acts
of
heroism
or
virtue
:
and
they
had
likewise
leave
given
them
to
pilfer
from
the
tables
what
they
could
,
in
order
to
teach
them
invention
and
dexterity.
The stairday was an after -meal, furnished out of the presents made to the table The xosis was a private entertainment, to which the host
invited his personal friends.
DRESS .
The precautions of Lycurgus against luxury extended also to dress. The young women wore only a woollen robe (ipation ), loose at one side and fastened over the shoulder with clasps. Besides this, married
women used an upper garment and a veil. The habit of males (Trabwe) was also of wool ; coarse and small, and renewed not oftener, at least by the youth, than once a -year.
Ointments
and
baths
were
prohibited
.
Embroidery
,
gold
,
and
precious
stones
were
allowed
only
to
courtezans
.
The
only
rings
in
use
were
of
iron
.
The
hair
and
beard
were
worn
long
;
but
the
hair
of
boys
was
cut
close
to
accustom
them
to
cold
.
Soldiers
were
dressed
in
scarlet
;
and
before
an
engagement
bound
chaplets
rowd
their
heads
.
LITERATURE.
It
was
inconsistent
with
the
object
of
Lycurgus
to
permit
his
country
men
to
bestow
much
care
on
letters
.
For
besides
diverting
their
atten
tion
from
gymnastic
exercises
,
he
foresaw
that
intellectual
culture
would
soon
raise
them
from
that
state
of
rudeness
which
he
wished
to
perpetuate
,
as
the
most
favourable
to
valour
.
The
course
of
study
,
accordingly
,
was
of
small
extent
,
and
embraced
only
what
was
positively
useful
,
and
in
unison
with
the
spirit
which
marked
the
public
institutions.
Reading
and
writing
were
generally
taught
;
as
also
poems
like
those
of
Tyrtæus
,
in
praise
of
magnanimity
:
but
comedy
was
proscribed
,
as
useless
,
and
tragedy
as
softening
the
character
by
the
tender
emotions
it
awakened
.
The
same
severity
extended
to
logic
,
rhetoric
,
and
history
.

MANNERS
AND
INSTITUTIONS
Eloquence was looked on as a mere instrument of delusion ; but hesides this it could never have attained much success among a people who
regarded conciseness as the chief excellence of style. Every thing, in short, either abstruse or ornamental, every thing that aimed at affecting the imagination or the heart, was treated with contempt. Dancing, from its connexion with gymnastic exercises, was practised and encour
aged. The Spartan music was wholly martial, and of the rudest kind.
RELIGION
The influence of religion, as an instrument of forming the character, was too obvious for Lycurgus not to take advantage of it. The peculi
arities of the Spartan form of worship are a proof of this. The statues of the gods were represented armed ; the offerings made to them were to be of small value ; the prayers short, simple, and sincere. At certain
festivals, there were processions where the old recounted, in verse , their former exploits, and the young declared their willingness to die for their
country. Fears and lamentations for the dead were prohibited : the period of mourning lasted only eleven days. The place of burial was within
the city, in order that the people by having the tombs of their forefathers continually before their eyes, might be reminded of their virtues, and roused to emulate their example. As a farther incentive to heroic
bravery, epitaphs were held out as the exclusive privilege of those who fell in battle ; and as these tombs were erected in the vicinity of tem ples, the principle of patriotism was thus strengthened and elevated by religious associations.
WARFARE ,
In addition to the ordinary exercises of the Spartans, which all tended, as we have said , in an eminent degree, to qualify them for war, they were also taught military tactics as an art. That it was not conquest,
however, which Lycurgus proposed as the object of his system , appears not only from some of his laws directly forbidding it, but also from the fact that the territories of Sparta received no accession during the most flourishing period of her history. So far, indeed, as the art of war was
cultivated on its own account, it was intended merely for self -defence, while the great design of the other institutions was public temperance and virtue.
The military age at Sparta lasted till the fortieth year from manhood,
or the sixtieth from birth ; but there is some uncertainty as to the period when it commenced. Those liable to serve were called su@gougos. The
army consisted of λοχοι πεντηκοστυες , ενωματια , and μοραι. Τhe relative numbers which these divisions contained is not very clearly ascertained . In the battle of Mantinea, there were seven doxos, each containing four
FENTILOOTUES, and each TEVTNXOOTUS four ivwpatid . Perhaps, however, this proportion was only occasional . There was another body of six



OF THE SPARTANS. 785
hundred light infantry, the oxigtas doxos, who marched in front, to be ready for any rapid movement. A number of Helots were often attached
to the regular troops. The cavalry were few , and seldom of much ser vice .
The Spartans were prohibited to pursue far from the field , to strip the slain, to besiege any city, to remain long in the same quarters, or fight often with the same enemy.
When encamped , the soldiers were obliged to lie in their armour, in case of any sudden assault ; but however great a privation this
might be to others, it was none to men who regarded war as a pastime. As a relief from the more rigid discipline of the city, a sacrifice was offered by the king, just before engaging, after which they advanced to the sound of flutes . In action, their courage was calm and com
posed ; in this respect differing from that of the more northern Greeks. What with the fortitude imparted by the laborious course of training, the
moral courage and devotedness to the state, which so many influences
conspired to form , and the ignominy which awaited cowardice, the feel ing of all was,-victory or death !
REVENUES .
The
expenses of the Spartan government were defrayed not by regular taxation , but by occasional assessments to the amount required by the exigency. The ordinary sources, whence the revenue was derived , were
the pogos, or contingents of the Laconians and allies, and the glo popect, levied on the property of the citizens. Considerable sums were also obtained from the sale of spoils, and the ransoms of prisoners. As the
amount of tribute was regulated by the circumstances, there was no treasury at Sparta till after the Peloponnesian war ; but the immense quantities of gold and silver then brought from Athens, rendered the
erection of one necessary , and from that time the city contained more of these metals than any other in Greece.

GRECIAN WEIGHTS, MEASURES, AND MONIES .
MEASURES OF LENGTH.— The unit of lineal measure adopted by the Greeks was the foot (tous ), of which the dártudos, or finger's breadth, was ',
and the puhasth or palm , £. The latter was also understood by doxun, from dégoueas to receive, by the compound term daxTudodáxun, and by dwgov, which properly signifies a gift ; the application of the latter term to this measure is commonly explained by the fact, that the palm of the hand is naturally extended in receiving a gift. Etibapin, or span , equals
12 dáxtudos, and is defined by Hesychius to be the distance from the extremity of the thumb to that of the little finger, when the hand is
opened with a view of grasping or measuring any object. The divisions of the πούς, more rarely employed , are κόνδυλος , διχάς, λιχάς, and ορθό
dwpor ; the first being 2 dáxtudo, and the second | Toūs, hence entitled by Theophrastus ήμισόδιον. The Λιχάς , was 10 δάκτυλοι, and the oρθό dwpor, being the length of the hand from the wrist to the extremity of the middle finger, equalled 11 dártudos. Pollux, (Lib. 2 ) from whom the previous definitions have been derived, informs us that guypeń = 18 súr tudo , was the distance from the elbow to the extremity of the meta carpal bo of the middle finger, while that reckoned to the extremity
of its first phalanx was πυγών = 20 δάκτυλοι, and that πήχυς = 24 δάκτυλοι, was the cubit, or the distance from the elbow to the extremity of the
middle finger. The rñgus then contained 1} sódes. The Bhua was 2 Fródes, and thus corresponded to the pes sestertius of the Romans. It was
employed by the people at large as the unit of distance, whence Bopez Tir
Taà means measurers of roads. 'Ogguid, or fathom , from ógéyw , tend , ” is the distance from the hands, when the arms are raised and
extended, measured along the breast, and equals 6 róðrs ; hence it has
received from Herodotus the epithets τετράπηχυς and εξαπόδης. The measure from which the Romans probably borrowed their decempeda was άκαινα or κάλαμος=10 πόδεςκαι six of these constituted the άμμα , which
together with the πλέθρον = 100 πόδες, and the κάλαμος was used princi

pally in the measurement of lands. The most ancient itinerary
measure of the Greeks was the orádsoy, which appears to have had a very
rude origin. It is said to have been the invention of Hercules, whose athletic exertion it exhibited, since it comprehended the distance which
he was able to run without taking breath. Isidorus informs us, that it
took its name from iotapes, " to stand ," and assigns as a reason , “ quod in fine respirasset simulque stetisset. It was established as the measure of
the length of the aúnòs, or foot course , at the Olympic games , and from
the respect in which these exercises were held, it became an itinerary This distance, the hero who instituted it measured by the
length of his foot, which he found equal to one six -hundredth part of the Censorinus and M. Gosselin have endeavoured to show that
there were different stadia employed among the Greeks, but their re
marks have been completely refuted by Wurm . ' ITHızóv, or the distance a horse could run , “ sub uno spiritu ,” equals 4 orádia, and dóanxos has
been variously assumed as 6, 7 , 8, and even 24 orádice, but more cor rectly as 12. Those linear measures which were known to the Greeks by their intercourse with other nations, were mínios, or the Roman mile
=8 orádia ; nugaráyyns = 30 orádice, according to Herodotus ii. 6. and Xenophon , ( Anab. v. 7.) though Strabo makes it in different places 40 and 60 orádia ; and oxoīvos, an Egyptian measure , whose value is differ ently assigned to be 60, 40, and 32 stádia .
DETERMINATION OF THE GREEK FOOT . - There are two methods of in
vestigating the value of the toūs proposed to us : the first consists in its
determination by its ratio to the Roman foot; the second, by means of
the public edifices of the Greeks which are yet standing. 1. All authors agree that the ratio subsisting between the Roman and Greek foot is 24 : 25, as might also be inferred from the value the Greeks
assigned to μίλιον, which we have mentioned was 8 στάδια = 4,800 πόδες =5,000 pedes. Now the Roman foot having been determined = .97075 feet, the value of the Greek foot hence deduced is 1,0111812 feet.

III. MEASURES OF CAPACITY. - 1 . For Liquids.-- The greatest liquid
measure was μετρητής , which was also called κάδος , from χάδειν , « to contain ;" regápov, probably from its being made of horn ; and appogsùs,
from éppípogeus, receiving its name from the two handles by which it was
Carried. Another synonym vvas στάμνιον, ( « κεράμιον του οινού ή ύδατος otápsov , " Hesychius.) From the verses of Rhemnius Fannius,
“ Attica præterea dicenda est amphora nobis Seu cadus; hunc facies, si nostræ addideris urnam ,"
appears that the festgnans = lt amphoræ = 8 gallons 2 quarts 0,46 pints. It contained 12 zows, 72 Ekotes, and 144 noturas; and, by comparing the Roman and Greek capacious measures, we will perceive that the rows
corresponded in value to the congius, giorns to sextarius, and morúan to hemina . Certain festivals at Athens were called fóss, because, according
to Suidas, every man had a goûs of wine given him, and, as Athenæus
declares, because Demophoon , king of Athens, offered a sweet- cake, and
Dionysius the tyrant, a crown of gold, as a prize to the first person who drank a rows of wine. Korúan derived its name from its cavity, and Galen mentions that the norúan and hemina were applied by the ancient
physicians to the same use with the modern graduated glasses of our
apothecaries, being vessels of horn , of rectangular or cylindrical shape, divided on the outer side by means of lines into 12 parts, which they
called ounces of measure ( ourgíus feetgiraf), and which corresponded to a certain number of ounces by weight, (ovyklas otcbpizai.) Now the hemina, being 1-96 of the amphora, weighed when filled with wine, 10 unciæ , so that the account of Galen is involved in doubt, inasmuch as the ounce by
measure was hence 5-6 of that by weight. Tiragrov, ožúßepov, and zúcados,
were respectively equal to the quartarius, acetabulum , and cyathus of the Romans. The remaining measures are xéyxn, peúotgov, xchun, and
xoxarágios, concerning which authors are slightly at variance . Cleopatra makes a greater and less xóvxn, the greater being the same with the
ögußepov, the less } rúabos ; while Pliny ( H. N. xii . 25. ) makes the réyxn a determinate measure. Μύστρον, or μύστλαν, was borrowed , a its name imports, from the shell of the sea-mouse , and was of two kinds. the less and more common being & xúabos, the greater 1-18 of the xotúan. Xhun, derived also from some shell - fish , was divided into the greater or rustic = 1-20 nothan ; and the less, or that used by physicians = 1-30
κοτύλη. Κοχλιάριον was equal to και χώμη.
2. For things dry . The largest measure employed in the measurement of grain was Médipsos = 6 Modii.
Its divisions were ogíros, éxtos, and ópisztov ; and it contained 48 Xorxes ; so that the zoīviğ equalled 4 roturas. The remaining measures were the same with the liquid measures. ( See Tables 4 and 5.)

χους .
Suidas = 6 χάλχοι. Τhe Romans translated χαλχος αreolus , and λέπτον minuta, or minutia . Though Rhemnius Fannius asserts that the Greeks used no weights less than the óboaós, the physicians employed some
smaller, viz.: xegátios, equal to the siliqua of the Romans, = 1-144 uncia,
and oitágios, or grain, = 4 siliqua. The multiples of the ponderal unit, or the weights greater than the dga xus, were the pevã , or mina, = 100, and rádaytoy = 6000 dea xual. From Libra, the later Greeks derived their Artpa , which, in imitation of the Romans, they divided into 12
ovyrian. The sáravtoy being, according to Livy, (38. 38.) 80 Libræ ,
the Libra= 75 dga xuad and the spazun = 1-70 Libra = 67,327 grains ; which result differs very little from that assigned by Wurm . Considering
that a more correct value of the dea zuen might be obtained from the coins extant, he has followed the determinations of Letronne, and assumed it
= 82 , 1-7 Par grains = 67,3349 grains. (See Tables 6 and 7.)

The oboros was so called , because, previously to the introduction of coined money, it was in the form of a small spit. The silver coins
referring to the οβολός, are τεσρόβολον, τριώβολον, διόβολον, ημιβόλιον, and Sigarxov ; but those are most celebrated which refer to the deaxrñ, viz. :
δίδραχμον, τρίδραχμον, τετράδραχμον. Romeo de l'Isle mentionsa Greek coin of silver , = ll dga xual, and Plato and Julius Pollux speak of the TEYTNXOYTÁdeaquor, which, were it a coin, must have been very large. Δραχμή quasi δραγμή, is interpreted a handful of 6 οβολοί , which were
equal to it in value ; it was employed in the computations of the Greeks, as the sestertius was by the Romans, Plutarch affording us many examples.
The egaxuñ varied in different countries determining the ráaartoy of corresponding variation ; that of Ægina was called razsīce, since it equalled if Attic drachms, in contradistinction with the Attic, called dereń.
There is mention made of the Boūs, a coin so called from the stamp of
an ox with which it was impressed, reputed equal to the sidqaxmov, and coined of gold and silver. This was perhaps one of the most ancient Greek coins, being known to Homer, if we credit the testimony of Julius Pollux, and to it that immortal bard is supposed to allude, when he sings
of Glaucus changing his golden armour, worth 100 Boss, for the brazen
one of Diomede. The retçádza zmov, or silver orarhg, appears to have been the coin most generally in use among the Greeks. Livy informs us, that between the years 564 and 566, A. U.C. there were brought to Rome by M. Fulvius 118,000, by M. Acilius 113,000, by L. A. Regillus 34,700 , and by Scipio Asiaticus 22,400 terpádpa xha . So many speci mens of them remain, that they are to be found atthe present day in al most every collection . Letroune having accurately examined 500 of



790 MEASURES, WEIGHTS, AND MONIES
them , and arranged them according to the centuries in which they were
struck , deduced the mean weight of the old Attic deathen coined two centuries and more B. C. = 82 1-7 Par. grs. = 67.3349 grs. and its purity being .97, its value is 9d. 2.85 far. or 17 cts. 5:93 mills Federal
currency. The latter Attic dga xchen was also found = 77 1-7 Par. grs. = 63.236 grs. and its value thereby determined is 9d. 0.487 far. or 16 cts.
5:22 mills. The Xgrooūs, or golden otathg, weighed 2 , and was valued at 20 dga xrecà ; golden pieces were coined of double and half its weight,
and though no Attic staters remain at the present day, there have been preserved some Darics and Philippics, whose purity is very remarkable, being .979. The ratio of gold to silver varied at different periods. Hero dotus estimates it as 13 to 1 ; in the dialogue of Hipparchus, commonly
ascribed to Plato, it is 12 to 1, and Lysias the orator, assumes it as 10 to 1 , which last ratio was preserved without alteration . The Mina (Myã ), according to Plutarch , equalled 75 dpaxua ), till the
time of Solon, who made it contain 100. The Attic talent of silver
equalled 60 minæ ; that of Ægina, which was current at Corinth, was 100 ; and the Attic talent of gold was 600 minæ, according to the pro
portion of gold and silver just premised. For the values of the different coins, see tables 8 and 9.

THE ATHENIAN COINAGE.
ANCIENT authors, and other usual sources of information , throw little light upon the management of the mint at Athens, and this circumstance
seems to imply, that the right of coinage was monopolized by the state , and the economy of the department veiled from the popular eye. Indeed , we may well conceive that the monetary system could not have been prudently entrusted to comparatively irresponsible individuals, and that
the general safety was best consulted by connecting it with the govern ment. The inscriptions and devices of the coins themselves evidence
the fact : the national insignia, emblematic allusions to the state , together with the Athenian title, were the uniform bearings of the coin ; and it was only an exception to the general rule, when names of individuals and local references were added .
The most important feature in the Athenian coinage was its purity
and freedom from alloy ; for though the ancient method of refining could scarcely succeed in wholly separating the silver from the lead always found with it in the mines of Laurium , numismatic researches have dis covered very little impurity in the Athenian coin, and in no instance
have detected the presence of copper, which, as being more suitable for the purpose, would have been employed for wilful adulteration . The
usages of modern states, not excepting our own country, present a de cisive contrast. The silver coin of Henry the Eighth , and of his suc cessor, were repeatedly adulterated, till in the end, 3 oz. fine, and 9 oz. alloy, were substituted for 11 oz. 2 dwts. fine, and 13 dwts. alloy, which
1 Abridged from Cardwell's Lectures on the Coinage of the Greeks and Romans.



OF THE GREEKS. 795
had been the national standard. Impurity was at the same time intro..
duced into the gold coinage, yet with little or scarcely any reference to the respective values of that metal and silver. The consequences may be conceived : mercantile transactions were thrown into confusion, and
nearly suspended ; and though penal enactments were resorted to in sup port of the legal tender, the severities of the law were rendered nullities by a course of evasion, which , while it produced temporary relief, laid
the foundation of lasting distress. During a period of intestine trouble, an attempt was indeed made to debase the coinage of Athens with copper ; but this act was met by so strong a feeling of discontent, that the national
standard was very shortly after restored . Therefore, though we may find difficulty in assigning to the existing specimens of Athenian silver their
true era, we may consider them as applying to the most flourishing por
tions of Athenian history, and vouching for the extreme purity of the coinage. Purity was not the only superiority of the Athenian coin over that of modern states. It might probably be owing, in a good measure, to the rude process of minting, that the coin issued from the mint in a form best
of all suited to prevent loss by friction . However this may be, the globu lar form , admitting it to be inconvenient for transfer, maintained the value of the coin unimpaired during a long circulation . The effect of friction was also reduced by the purity ; it being an ascertained fact, “ that the purer the metal is, the less consumption of it from friction arises in use."
A remarkable fact connected with the Athenian money is the confine ment of the issue to one species ; for if we except the copper coinage,
which was comparatively of no importance, we find the legal currency restricted to silver coins, ranging from the tetradrachm to the quarter ohol. The operations of commerce brought the gold coin of other states
into Athens ; but though these were received in payment without mur mur, and circulated amongst themselves, they appear to have been rated according to their intrinsic value. It may excite surprise that the Athe
nians should display so much adroitness in the management of their cur rency, at a period when , we presume, the arts of government were scarcely matured ; but historical evidence is at hand to prove the extent of their commercial transactions, whence may be inferred a cor

It is scarcely necessary to insist on the attention that was paid to the subdivision of the coinage, to meet the various demands of commercial convenience, since, with few exceptions, this provision has always been •3x2

made in monetary systems. The freedom with which the Athenians allowed their coin to be exposed is more worthy of remark . Xenophon
confirms this usage ; and Plato and Polybius make mention of a money
common to all Greece, which, it is probable, was the silver coin of Athens.
A question of apparent difficulty here suggests itself: since the Athe nians so well understood the principles of a currency , and were so inge
nious in its management, how is it to be accounted for, that at a period when taste and refinement prevailed so generally at Athens, the coin of that state should retain its coarseness of execution and rude appearance , when
the money of other and inferior districts was distinguished for its beauty
and elegance ? The most obvious, and perhaps the only satisfactory answer that can be returned is, that a change of coinage, though in reality
unimportant, is ever viewed with jealousy ; and in the case of the Athe nian silver , which was renowned for its purity, any change that might
tend to improve its appearance would be impolitic, since it would in effect
destroy the identity of a currency whose reputation could never be sur passed . For the reason just mentioned, the Venetians retain their sechin ,
which “ is perhaps the most unseemly of the coins of modern Europe. ” And, in 1818, an issue of the inelegant crowns of Maria Theresa was made from the mint at Milan, solely because they were highly esteemed in the Levant trade.
In the age of Demosthenes, and prior to his time, the bankers at Athens held an important station in the monetary system . These were
usually manufacturers or speculators, who, while pursuing their individual advantage, found means to give profitable employment to the spare capital
of such as intrusted them. They had also an understanding with each other, resembling in its operations the modern clearing house , by which
depositors could make transfers to each other, or obtain receipts to their credit ; and the effect of this regulation was to produce a distinct kind of money, similar to our bills of exchange. Farther than this, the govern
ment was accustomed to issue évopohorúuata , or cash orders, on well accredited security ; and these exchequer bills (for such they may be
termed), we are informed , were sometimes drawn, in cases of emergency, to meet the demands of the state, when the payment was most probably referred to the national revenue .

and intrinsically valueless, tokens of this country met the exigencies of local trade prior to the issue of the present coinage. Ficoroni published a dissertation on ancient leaden coins, and introduced a vast number of
specimens referring to the era of the Antonines, but generally believed to be of more modern date . Some of these, however, waving the authen ticity of date, seem rather to have been used as weights, others have the
character of tesseræ , and those which may claim to be reckoned as coins, have nothing to recommend them to notice. We may, therefore, confine ourselves to a few cursory remarks on the gold , silver, and copper money of the ancients.
Whatever impurities attached to the gold in its original state were
separated from it by fire. This powerful agent, how great soever its in tensity , can effect no injury on the gold, yet carries off in fume, or de posits apart from the metal, all extraneous adhesions or alloying substances . The ancient method of refining, though rude and unassisted by any
de
fined
chemical
process
,
was
so
successful
,
that
we
are
informed
the
Daries
of
Persia
contained
only
zde
of
alloy
,
while
the
gold
coins
of
Philip
and
Alexander
boasted
of
still
higher
purity
.
A
specimen
of
the
gold
cur
rency
of
Vespasian
was
tested
at
Paris
,
and
the
alloy
found
to
be
in
the
ratio
of
only
1
to
788.
In
contrast
to
this
,
we
may
mention
the
gold
coinage
of
our
own
country
,
which
contains
alloy
in
the
proportion
of
1
to
12
.
Silver and copper are the alloys in general use ; and the admixture of a very small quantity of either with the pure gold, is a corrective of the
extreme malleability of the latter, and renders it in many respects more suitable for circulating medium . The ancient electrum was a compound metal, composed , as stated by Pliny, of four parts of gold to one of silver ; but other authorities reduce its value by affirming that the proportion of
the more precious metal was not so great. Existing specimens vary, however, very considerably in their degrees of purity. The brass coinage was a mixed metal, composed of tin and native cop per ; and as these substances were never found combined together in the ores, it is probable that the ancients were not ignorant of the advantages
resulting from their admixture. When examining the remains which have been transmitted to our own times, we notice that the coins which
are altogether, or mostly native copper, are much corroded and defaced ; whilst those that have a due portion of alloy are not only more perfect,
but have acquired an attractive richness of hue, which it has been found impossible to imitate with exactness.
The
accidental
admixture
of
gold
,
silver
,
and
copper
,
at
the
siege
of
Corinth
,
is
stated
to
have
produced
the
compound
known
under
the
name
of
Corinthian
brass
.
Of
what
nature
soever
the
composition
might
have
been
,
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
ever

to

purposes
:
no
more
than

to
it

therefore
necessary

this
place

rather than the quality of the metal itself, gave rise to and maintained its extraordinary reputation. The coins and medals of the ancients were not cast in a mould , but
received their impression under the hammer ; and it is remarkable that
they should have adopted such a process, since their knowledge of metals
was too limited to produce a material for the dies of sufficient temper to sustain the required force, and hence they must be frequently making This is evidenced by the fact, that seldom indeed have two
ancient coins been discovered apparently proceeding from the same die ; and in a large collection of Sicilian medals, made by the prince Torre Muzza, no two exist which in every particular resemble each other. The devices and bearings of the ancient coins form a subject far too
intricate and diffuse to be discussed at length on the present occasion . Traditionary legends, the worship of the deities, and allusions to the
arts, and to the actions of illustrious men, were impressed upon the
metal, together with national emblems, and smaller devices referring to the different mints, or the sigla of the treasurers. The names of the coins were derived in some instances from their bearings, and in others
from the name of the person hy whom, or of the place at which they were minted.
The devices by which the silver coinage of Athens is identified, and referred to its true era, consist of the inscription AOE, the head of Pallas, and the owl . The successive adjuncts to these devices mark with tolera ble certainty the respective dates of the coins. Prior to the time of
Pericles, the helmet of Pallas appears without ornament ; in the suc
ceeding period it is decorated with the sphinx and griffins, which were probably added from the Minervan statue in the Acropolis. In the earliest times the owl also is accompanied by an olive branch and a
crescent only ; but afterwards the laurel wreath upon a diota, together with a variety of emblems, allusive to the history of the state , were added. The owl was an universal emblem of the Athenians; and it is
remarkable to have the extent of citizenship denoted by its union on the coins of Athens with the national emblems of all the countries that held
commercial intercourse with that state. The corn - ear of Sicily, the
elephant of Africa, the pegasus of Corinth, the sphinx of Egypt, the lion of Leontium , and the flower of Rhodes, are associated with the sacred bird. The devices of the Athenian coin were so generally adopted, that,
at length, they became permanently established at the Roman mint, and were even impressed upon the currency of Sparta ; a singular coincidence , that the memory of Athenian greatness should thus have been perpetuated by her earliest and latest enemies.
It would be gratuitous trifling to remark on the reasons for introducing the head of Pallas and the owl on the coinage of Athens ; but some oh
servation appears necessary with reference to the diota , afterwards asso ciated with these emblems. Some connect this latter device with the
..

amphora of oil presented at the Panathenæic festival to the conquerors ;
while Corsini considers it an honorary allusion to the manufactures in terra cotta, on which the Athenians greatly prided themselves, and for which they obtained so great fame, that the poet Critias places the in
vention of the potter's wheel on equality with the trophy erected at
Marathon . It is probable, however, that the diota referred rather to the rich olive grounds of Athens ; since the same device was impressed on the coins of other countries to denote their best products.
