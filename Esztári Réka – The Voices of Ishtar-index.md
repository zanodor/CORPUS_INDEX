The Voices of Ištar
Prophetesses and Female Ecstatics in the Neo-Assyrian Empire
Abstract: On the basis of cuneiform sources, we try to analyse the role of prophecy in general in the Mesopotamian tradition, and of prophetesses and female ecstatics (ass. raggintu and mahhūtu) in particular in the Neo-Assyrian royal court (in the seventh century B.C.). The first part of this paper focuses on the ideas and rules applied to and made them members of a religious community, the institutional framework of the temple of Ištar, in the second part we intend to examine the political decision-making systems of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and define the proper place of prophetesses and other diviners within this structure.
Keywords: Mesopotamian Prophecy; Neo-Assyrian Period; Prophetesses, Devotees of Ištar; Liminality

In the course of our study on Neo-Assyrian prophecy, we did not intend to concentrate on the most commonly asked questions concerning Ancient Near Eastern prophetic literature. Therefore we investigated the phenomenon of Mesopotamian prophetism outside the context of its various alleged or attested parallels, its differences from or even connections with Biblical prophecy. Rather, we attempted to investigate those aspects of Neo-Assyrian prophecy which can be defined as essentially indigenous, Mesopotamian in nature. By the time of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (912–612 B.C.), the professional activity of prophetesses and female ecstatics looked back on a thousand years old tradition in the ancient Near East. Reports about their prophecies could be detected as early as the beginning of the second millennium B.C., in letters found in the city of Mari, on the banks of the Euphrates, today a main archeological site in Syria (Tell Hariri), from the 18th century B.C. Most Mari-texts were recovered in the archives of the famous royal palace, and can be dated approximately

to the final decade of the reign of Zimrī-Lîm, the last king of the independent kingdom of Mari (c. 1777–1761 B.C.).1 In these texts the most common term for a (so to say) professional prophet was āpilum / āpiltum (fem.) which is derived from the verb apālu(m), which means “to answer”—so they were primarily designated as “answerers.” The other common designations were muhhûm and its feminine counterpart muhhūtum. These titles are derived from the verb mahû(m), which literally means “to become crazy, to go into a frenzy,” so they refer to someone who reached an altered state of consciousness whereupon he or she received and transmitted divine messages–in other words, the latters were the designations of the ones we might call “ecstatic prophets.”2 The text corpus of Neo-Assyrian prophecies dates to the reigns of the kings Esarhaddon (681–669 B.C.) and his son and successor, Assurbanipal (668–631 B.C.). In contrast to the already mentioned prophetic letters from OldBabylonian Mari, the majority of extant Neo-Assyrian prophecies have not been preserved in an epistolary form, but rather in the form of oracle collections. Although in these collections the names of the oracle-giver prophets or prophetesses and their city of provenance were also included, there are no explicit references to the relevant historical circumstances. In this respect, they also differ from the Mari-texts—which were relevant only in connection with single historical events.3 The common word for “prophet” in Neo-Assyrian times was raggimu / raggintu (fem.), which literally means “shouter” or “proclaimer.” Among the

older terms, mahhû /mahhūtu (fem.) were still in use, although only in literary texts, where they were used as synonyms for the former ones.4 The first part of this paper seeks to examine these professional prophets and prophetesses primarily as members of Mesopotamian society, and the ideas and rules that applied to them, in other words, tries to determine their proper place and roles within the Mesopotamian social matrix. In this respect the first and most important preliminary statement has to be that prophets both in Old-Babylonian Mari and in Neo-Assyrian times were cultic functionaries, permanent members of certain temple communities. They were probably also housed within certain temples, temple complexes, which were in most cases dedicated to the goddess Inana/Ištar.5 The fact that they were integrated to the official cult of this goddess and formed part of the peculiar religious community of her devotees is of prime importance relating both to their social and—albeit it may sound surprising—their gender role. The phenomenon which we may properly call “the genuine Mesopotamian tradition of prophetic activity” is, as we will see, inseparable from its main source, namely the essential nature and capabilities of the most famous Mesopotamian goddess, Inana/Ištar. In Old-Babylonian Mari the most important local source of the oracles was the goddess Annunītum, a specific form of Ištar,6 whose very name was earlier merely an epithet of a female war goddess, Inana-Annunītum („Inana/Ištar, the skirmisher”).7

4 On the Neo-Assyrian terms in general see among others: PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, 45–47; NISSINEN, The Socioreligious Role, 90–91; and TEPPO, Women and their Agency, 84. 5 See also (inter alia) PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, esp. 47; TEPPO, Women and their Agency, 84; and NISSINEN, The Socioreligious Role, esp. 95–98 on Neo-Assyrian prophets as permanent members of the temple communities of Ištar, and also DE VILLIERS, The Origin of Prophetism, 3–4, with references to the similar situation reflected by the Mari documents (with further literature). 6 Other prominent oracle giver deities of the Mari-texts were Dagan, one of the main Syrian gods, who usually revealed his messages in his temple in Terqa (moder Tell Ashara), the city of origin of the family of king Zimrī-Lîm, and Adad, the Storm god of the Syrian city of Aleppo (ancient Halab). On the less frequently attested oracles of other gods see HUFFMON, A Company of Prophets, 49; NISSINEN, The Socioreligious Role, 100; NISSINEN, Prophets and Prophecy, 14–15. We have to stress that both prominent Syrian gods transmitted their oracles abroad, that is, in their own cult centers. In the city of Mari itself, Inana/Ištar-Annunītum, originally a NorthMesopotamian war goddess (see the following note), prevailed over the cultic domain of prophecy. 7 Inana/Ištar-Annunītum was the divine patron of the Dynasty of Sargon (c. 2334–2154 B.C.) and originally also the patron goddess of their capital. At some point towards the end of the period of the Akkadian Empire the kings of Akkad (Agade) gained control over Mari and main

The situation is similar, but even more unequivocal in Assyria. Here the prophets appeared as cultic devotees of Ištar already in the Middle-Assyrian period,8 and in Neo-Assyrian times most of them served in the temple of Ištar in Arbela (modern Erbil), which was the most important center of the Neo-Assyrian prophecy.9 We can also safely assume that, at least in Neo-Assyrian times, in those rare cases when gods other than Ištar such as Marduk or Nabû, so even male deities addressed the king by means of prophecy, the transmitter of their message was likewise a devotee of the goddess, a prophet linked with the temple and cult of Ištar.10

tained their rule there through the installation of a “military governor” (šakkanakkum), and during the period of the Akkadian rule the cult of Inana/Ištar-Annunītum was also imported to Mari. For a more detailed description of the structure of the Akkadian Empire, and also of the religious policies of the Akkadian kings, see WESTENHOLZ, The Old Akkadian Period, esp. 49–50, and on the spread of the cult of Inana/Ištar-Annunītum during the Akkadian period see also SALLABERGER, Der kultische Kalender, 198 with note 941. On the name and origin of the “Warlike Ištar”, Inana/Ištar-Annunītum see: SELZ, Five Divine Ladies, 34–35, with note 83. 8 In a ration list which can be dated to the 13th century B.C. (MARV 2 I 37'-39'), professional prophets and prophetesses (mahhê and mahhūtu) were grouped together with other cultic functionaries (among others assinnu-s, see below) of the temple of Ištar in the city of KārTukultī-Ninurta in Assyria, see JAKOB, Mittelassyrische Verwaltung und Sozialstruktur, 517–518. The other prominent oracle-giver goddess in the Neo-Assyrian documents, Mulissu, the wife of the state god Aššur, was also equated with Inana/Ištar. 9 See among others PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, 47; NISSINEN, The Socioreligious Role, 95–98. 10 Ištar was the par excellence mediator between deities and humans, accordingly, she transmitted the plans and decisions of the gods to the deified kings of the late 3rd – early 2nd millennium B.C. in South-Babylonia, within the confines of the so called sacred marriage rite (which basically can be regarded an elaborate cultural metaphor for the alliance and the establishment of social ties between the rulers and the divine world). On the latter interpretation of this rite see: COOPER, Sacred Marriage and Popular Cult, esp. 91; PONGRATZ-LEISTEN, When the Gods Are Speaking, 145–147; and more recently PONGRATZ-LEISTEN, Sacred Marriages and the Transfer. Later, in the Old-Babylonian period, when the phenomenon of prophecy was first detected in Mari and also in two other centers, Ešnunna in the Diyala Region and in the city of Uruk in South-Babylonia, she still remained the “voice of the gods”, the one who revealed their “secrets” to the kings. On the exceptional Old-Babylonian prophecies given by Ištar-Kitītum to king Ibalpiel II of Ešnunna (FLP 1674, from the city of Ishchali), and by Inana to Sîn-kašid of Uruk (W19990, I) see ELLIS, The Goddess Kititum Speaks (with the comments of PONGRATZLEISTEN, When the Gods Are Speaking, 157–159 and PONGRATZ-LEISTEN, Sacred Marriages and the Transfer); and PONGRATZ-LEISTEN, When the Gods Are Speaking, 155–157, respectively. The Mesopotamian evidence then clearly shows, that—as Beate Pongratz-Leisten already observed (PONGRATZ-LEISTEN, Cassandra's Colleagues, 24)—the prominent role of Inana/ Ištar in Ancient Near Eastern prophecy has to be considered a phenomenon of genuine Mesopotamian origin, largely differing from the ancient Syrian tradition, in which the prophetic voice of Adad and Dagan were the dominant ones. The role of Ištar as divine mediatrix became traditional and

In short, to define the proper social role of the Mesopotamian prophets and prophetesses, who were in most cases also cultic functionaries of the goddess Ištar, moreover, to understand their connection to other members of the temple communities of this deity, and to her cult as a whole, and finally to shed light on the peculiar features that enabled or qualified them for functioning as a mouthpiece of the goddess, first it is reasonable to examine the proper character of their divine mistress herself. Considering that in some respects her devotees also impersonated her, we shall start by assessing the special qualities which, according to Mesopotamian concepts, empowered Inana/Ištar herself to be, as was already said, the main source of the prophetic oracles of ancient Mesopotamia.
Mistress of Heaven—Mistress of Prophecy
As to her role in the Mesopotamian pantheon, it is well known that the deity known as Inana in her Sumerian and Ištar in her Akkadian name was the most significant goddess of love, of war and also of the planet Venus. Her cult enjoyed great popularity over approximately three millennia. This goddess has been the subject of a great deal of discussion and dispute since the earliest days of assyriology. By all accounts, Inana/Ištar embodied within herself polarities and contraries, or, to quote Rivka Harris, “she was a deity who incorporated fundamental and irreducible paradoxes.”11 Most prominently, her frequently pictured sexual allure was connected to a certain propensity to violence: she could be described as the most beautiful female creature, whether an alluring maiden or a temptress, while other texts stress over and over again her thirst for blood and her love of battle and carnage. According to the latter peculiarities, she is often represented in the visual arts as a female representative of a typically male role, as a fully armed warrior,

even more pronounced in first millennium Mesopotamia. On those cases, when another deity spoke through a prophet or prophetess of Ištar see in general (inter alia) NISSINEN, The Socioreligious Role, 99–101; and TOORN, Mesopotamian Prophecy, 78–79. An illustrative example for the latter phenomenon is the case of Bayâ, a prophet/prophetess from Arbail (whose gender role might be regarded uncertain, see below), who proclaimed the oracles of Bēl (Marduk), Ištar of Arbail and also of Nabû to king Esarhaddon in 681 B.C., see PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, 6–7 (SAA 9 1.4, and possibly also 2.2, on the latter see PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, 49 and 14–15). 11 HARRIS, Inanna–Ishtar as Paradox, 263.

Formerly it was assumed that this specific contradiction was the result of the fusion of the Akkadian Ištar, protectress of war and battle with the Sumerian Inana, the goddess of love and procreation.13 But such a fusion does not adequately explain Ištar’s personality, since many of her contradictory characteristics seem to have belonged already to the Sumerian Inana, the “Mistress of Heaven.”14 This heavenly Sumerian mistress was identified with the planet Venus. According to archaic texts from the city of Uruk, the foremost Sumerian cult center of Inana, we can distinguish between two distinct epiphanies of the goddess, namely “Morning Inana” (dI n a n a- h u d 2 ) and “Evening Inana” (dI n a n a - s i g ).15 Thus she was seen and worshiped as the planet Venus shining in the morning or in the evening sky respectively, and it is also clear from these archaic textual references that two different cults existed alongside for the Morning and the Evening Inana, that is, for the two distinct manifestations of the same deity. At this point it is tempting to connect this peculiarity with the following statements (although they stem from later texts from the first millennium) relating to her astral manifestations in question, because they highly correspond to the dual character of Inana/Ištar mentioned above, that is, to her dual nature as goddess of love and of war. According to certain astrological omens and omen commentaries, when “the Venus rises in the East, she is female, (but) when she rises in the West, she is male.”16 So as Morning Star, Venus was female, but as Evening Star, she assumes a male aspect,17 and this latter, male Ištar is also described and often even repre

In this regard the decoration of an Archaic period cylinder seal is also worth mentioning, since it preserved among its elements the e z e n (which means “festival” in Sumerian), the standard of Inana, star decorations and the signs that represent the sunrise and the sunset, see HOROWITZ, Sumerian Star-Names, 175 with note 48. 16 Inter alia: Ach.

sented as bearded. For example, a hymn of the goddess Nanaya, in which she assumes the appearance of Ištar, proclaims that “in Babylon, I am bearded”18while the duplicate of the same text has the variant: “In Babylon, I am a male.” We may also quote a later hymn of king Assurbanipal, in which Ištar “like the god Aššur has a beard.”19 This is the exact same phenomenon which was depicted for example on the cylinder seal in Fig. 2 below, which can presumably be dated again to the 3rd millennium. Here Inana/Ištar seems to be depicted as a female with male gender characteristics, and she appears fully armed again, but this time wearing a beard.20

17 On the original, presumably male manifestation of the Semitic Ištar (Aštar) as Evening Star, and also on the possible existence of a female from, the divine manifestation of the Morning Star see SELZ, Five Divine Ladies, 32 with note 44 and further literature (and contra GRONEBERG, Die sumerische-akkadische Inanna/Ištar, 30–31). This “male Ištar” (written as dI n a n a - n i t a ) seemingly appears already in the pre-Sargonid texts from the city of Mari, see ibid. The concept of the warrior, male-like aspect of the goddess as Morning Star is also evidently present in the Old-Babylonian hymn of king Iddin-Dagan, which we will in turn analyze in detail (IddinDagan A, see below with note 31). 18 ziqna zaqnāku in LKA 37:3, see REINER, A Sumero-Akkadian Hymn, 224, strophe I, line 4. 19 akî dAššur ziqni zaqnat, ABRT 1 7:6 (=SAA 3 7, Assurbanipal’s Hymn to Ištar of Nineveh), which uses in turn a rather common expression and picture of the Venus-omens from the first millennium, see the relevant examples in CAD Z 126 (sub. ziqnu, usage b). 20 BM 130694, c. 1850–1720 B.C., see the more detailed description in WESTENHOLZ, Inanna and Ishtar, 337 (with Fig. 23.3).

So Inana/Ištar could represent both sexes, in her “own” words: “(Though) I am a woman, I am a noble young man.”21 She could also represent the typical traits and behaviors traditionally attributed to both men and women—it goes without saying that these are socially constructed gender roles—so she was able to embody both femaleness and maleness. For example, in the famous passage of the Gilgamesh-Epic, she is the one who—in a rather assertive way—proposes marriage to the hero—thereby she, acting as a man, assumes a typically masculine role.22 By shattering and confusing the boundaries that separated sexes and gender roles she clearly defines them, but also, to some extent, exceeds and, above all, unites them, and thus sometimes she can be seen as a genderless person (or more properly: god). So Inana/Ištar has to be considered and interpreted, most appropriately, as the goddess of boundaries. She is the sole deity who was capable of transgressing a wide variety of social, moral, biological or even transcendental boundaries. For example, she was the only deity who was able to descend to and ascend from the Netherworld, the realm of the dead. Moreover, she was the only god who could not only unite what was once separated, but, as an essentially liminal figure, she was also the one most capable of connecting the two sides of the boundaries. Thus she was able to mediate between different spheres of existence: the divine and human worlds.

the consequent ambiguous gender role of her devotees, who were “men turned into women.” According to the famous passage of a Sumerian hymn attributed to Enheduana, daughter of king Sargon of Akkad and high priestess (e n) of the Moon god in the city of Ur:
To turn a man into a woman and a woman into a man are yours, Inana (In-nin-ša3-gur4-ra Hymn 120)23
This fact enabled her devotees to unite with the goddess on a level that no ordinary man could have achieved, and therefore they discarded their original (presumably) male identity. However, it is impossible to determine whether they were eunuchs, or (at least in some cases) congenitally malformed individuals with sexual defects, that is, for example, hermaphrodites or simply transvestites.24 The commonest titles worn by them were the following:25

In the latter text the speaker is Ištar herself: “I change the right side to left, I turn the man into a woman, the woman into a man.” Tablet XX, lines 65–68 of the composite text, see VOLK, Die Balağ̃-Komposition, 143–144. 24 Compare HARRIS, Inanna–Ishtar as Paradox, 276; LEICK, Sex and Eroticism, esp. 158 (on the sexual status of the assinnu and kurgarrû, see below); and more recently TEPPO, Sacred marriage, 75–76, 78–79 and on their physical sex: op. cit. 89. 25 On the titles, peculiarities and activities of the kurgarrû and assinnu see the thorough study of Stefan M.

As it can be seen, besides the reasonable renderings of “man-woman” and “transvestite,”26 both titles used to be referred to also as “male prostitutes,”27 although there is no serious evidence which could confirm this presumed function, and for the most part this supposition is based on alleged cross-cultural parallels—first and foremost on the sexual and social roles of the famous Hijra of contemporary India, ritual performers who are also “neither male nor female.”28 More cautious translations, as well as those provided by the main dictionary entries, designate them rather as “ritual performers.”29 They were also the nearest “colleagues” of the prophets, as their titles regularly appeared together not only in ration lists, but also in the lexical tradition, indicating that in certain respects they were considered to be similar.30 Furthermore, some

assinnu-s in the Mari-texts appear even as transmitters of the prophetic messages of the goddess Annunītum, while in the Neo-Assyrian prophetic record the ambiguous gender identity of (professional) prophets is at times also distinctively marked, chiefly through the seemingly inconsistent usage of the gender-determinatives before their names. For more details on this, see below. The most telling source regarding the characteristics and functions of these peculiar cult personnel is the famous Inana-Dilibad (Venus) Hymn, also known as Iddin-Dagan A and as the Sacred Marriage Hymn of Iddin-Dagan (an early Old-Babylonian ruler from Isin, who reigned 1974–1954 B.C., as the third king of the first dynasty of Isin).31 This literary composition, written in Sumerian, includes an exceptionally vivid and detailed description of the procession and rituals preceding and following the proper rite of sacred marriage. The passage quoted below begins with the description of the ceremonial march and symbolic activities of the s a ğ - u r - s a ğ (the Akkadian assinnu-s) before the goddess, which presumably took place in the evening before the culmination of the festival on “New Year’s Day”32—that is, the consummation of the marriage of the goddess with the king, appearing as her divine spouse, the god Dumuzi.

The above translation follows the line numbering of the composite text edited in ETCSL. For a brief summary of the events and the ritual process described in this composition, see COOPER, Sacred Marriage and Popular Cult, 92–94; GRONEBERG, Lob der Ištar, 138–145; and more recently JONES, Embracing Inana, 292–296; and BÖCK, Überlegungen zu einem Kultfest, 27–29. Although all the known manuscripts of the hymn (originating from the city of Nippur) date to the eighteenth century B.C., we can safely assume that the original composition was written during the reign of Iddin-Dagan, see REISMAN, Iddin-Dagan’s Sacred Marriage Hymn, 185 (with the list of the manuscripts); JONES, Embracing Inana, 292 with note 10; and also BÖCK, Überlegungen zu einem Kultfest, 26. For a general overview of the historical context of Iddin-Dagan A see RÖMER, Hymnen und Klagelieder, 35–37; and CHARPIN, Histoire Politique du ProcheOrient, 60–64. 32 According to lines 175–176 on the day after the above described ritual activities, which was also the day of the disappearance of the moon, the bed of Inana was set up for the subsequent ceremonies of the „New Year's Day:” (z a g - m u ): u d n u 2 - a m e š u d u 7 - d u 7 - d e 3 / z a g m u u d ğ a r z a - k a “So that on the day of the disappearance of the moon the divine powers can be perfected, / at the New Year, on the day of the rites” (a bed was set up for Inana). Since the edition of the classic study of Walther Sallaberger on the cultic calendar of the Ur III period (SALLABERGER, Der kultische Kalender) it is now widely accepted, that the Sumerian term z a g m u (literally “the side/boundary of the year”) did not referred to an overall state ceremony with a fixed date, but rather to the main feasts of the prominent city-gods, celebrated at different dates in different locations, that is, the marked beginning of the cultic year according to each individual local calendar, see SALLABERGER, Der kultische Kalender, 142–143 with note

669, 175, 310; and the brief summary of the evidence in SALLABERGER, Neujahr(sfest). However, consideration of relatively certain facts might permit another interpretative approach, which is also relevant to the precise dating of the ceremony in question. The facts relevant in this respect are the following: the ceremony explicitly took place before and during the first visibility of the new moon, presumably after the spring equinox (on the appearance of the new moon, “Neulichttag” in a cultic context see SALLABERGER, Der kultische Kalender, esp. 38–39 and 54, and on the later Babylonian tradition of the “ideal” beginning of the year at this very date, on the first of Nisan see among others HOROWITZ, The 360- and 364-Day Year, 36; and PONGRATZLEISTEN, Neujahr(sfest), 294–295), and additionally the hymn of king Iddin-Dagan, along with other literary texts also related to the sacred marriage rite, contain numerous “astral” or astronomical references. As it has already been suggested by Daniel Foxvog (FOXWOG, Astral Dumuzi), concerning the clear connection of the “Astral Dumuzi” with the new moon, such rituals had close ties with certain astronomical phenomena. It seems quite probable, that they were connected not only with the moon, but, at least in these “ideal” literary descriptions, also with the rising, setting and periodic cycles of the sun and the Planet Venus, observable for the naked eye. On the early Mesopotamian astronomical observations in the 3rd and early 2nd millennium in general (and further on the periodicity of Venus, see note above 15) see HOROWITZ, Some Thoughts on Sumerian Star-Names, and esp. 174 with note 45 for an astronomical calculation regarding New Years Day, mentioned in the Cylinder B of Gudea (III: 5–8). In the case of the hymn of Iddin-Dagan, the praising of Inana/Ištar above all as the Evening and later as the Morning Star also makes it reasonable to assume that the above described ritual cross dressing, reappearing in a late Old-Babylonian hymn of Ištar, but there in the case of “young men and women” (Ištar-Louvre = AO 6035, col. ii 1–20, see the text edition in GRONEBERG, Lob der Ištar, 26–27) symbolized basically the transformation/metamorphose of the planet Venus itself (for a similar presupposition see GRONEBERG, Lob der Ištar, esp. 152–154, pointing out the “shamanistic” character of the cult of the goddess, which was in turn already suggested by Stefan Maul, see MAUL, Kurgarrû und assinnu, 163–164), which took place after its conjunction with the Sun, a period of invisibility generally lasts three days in inferior conjunction—that is, a liminal period, during of which Venus was neither Evening or Morning Star, neither male nor female.

76 With daggers in their hands, the ascending k u r - g a r - r a (kurgarrû) priests... walk before her, holy Inana. Those who cover their swords with gore spatter blood as they walk before her, holy Inana. 80 Blood is poured on the dais of the throne room, as t i g i , š e m and a l a drums are made to sound loudly. (Iddin-Dagan “A”, ETCSL 2.5.3.1)
According to the beginning of this passage, the assinnu-s appear with their typical hair-style and colourful ribbons, while the following, well-known lines (6063) describe their mentioned transvestism or cross-dressing, that is, “on their right side they dress with man’s clothes, (and) their left side they cover with woman’s clothes.” Obviously, they emphasize their ambiguous gender by wearing male and female clothing and ribbons, while they perform (possibly) some sort of dance. The climax of the show is the appearance of the kurgarrû-s, who seemingly lacerate themselves in an ecstatic frenzy, accompanied by drums.33 Grasping a sword, they “cover” it with blood, then they pour out the blood “on the dais of the throne room.” This one is, again, a famous passage, and is often mentioned as a reference to ritual self-mutilation or even self-castration34—but, as we see, this text in itself does not clearly support an interpretation of this kind. Although this presupposition could base only on external evidence, namely on cross-cultural comparisons, it is not impossible that they indeed used some sort of ascetic technique in order to reach an altered state of consciousness in which they could achieve union with the goddess. In this latter respect the cross-dressing, together with one specific statement, seems to be more relevant. As line 49 of the hymn says, “The physical characteristic of divinity was present (with)in their bodies,” in other words, they were considered to be (one might say): holy (literally: endowed with “the k u š of divinity”).35 On this basis, it is even safer to assume that their transvestism, as it

33 Regarding the „ascending kurgara” (k u r - ǧ a r - r a e d 3 - d a ) in lines 74–75 Willem H. Ph. Römer (RÖMER, Sumerische Hymnen II, 42) suggested, that “ascending from below to above” is the literary expression of the goddess' ability to make people fall into trance. On descending and ascending among the “divine powers,” that is, abilities or rituals of Inana/ Ištar see note 45 below. 34 This interpretation is widely accepted, see for example HARRIS, Inanna–Ishtar as Paradox, 276; COOPER, Sacred Marriage, 93; GRONEBERG, Lob der Ištar, 143 with note 165; and more recently TEPPO, Sacred marriage, 79 and 83.

was already observed by Rivka Harris, simulated the androgyny of Inana/Ištar: by emulating their goddess, who was both female and male, they shattered the boundary between the sexes and genders.36 The prime function of ritual transvestism, as Mircea Eliade observed, was “to restore the initial completeness, the intact source of holiness and power.”37 This kind of androgyny, whether conceived as a union of opposites, or as the transcendence of social differences,38 constituted a liminal state, a state of holiness.

meaning of the word k u š , that is, “leather” (see ePSD sub. k u š , and for the same translation (in German) already: MAUL, Kurgarrû und assinnu, 169, note 40), and also the interpretation of Daniel Reisman (REISMAN, Iddin-Dagan's Sacred Marriage Hymn, 187): “They place upon their bodies the cloak of divinity,” according to which the k u š n a m - d i ğ i r - r a might have been an article of clothing. However, on the one hand, as the verb ğ a l 2 refers neither to clothing nor placing, but rather it simply means “to be,” those interpretations remain doubtful, as it was already observed by Gwendolyn Leick (LEICK, Sex and Eroticism, 290, note 1). On the other hand, regarding the rather enigmatic k u š , first of all, it is important to note, that it was written with the same cuneiform sign as the word s u in the same line (the sign SU), that is, it could be seen merely as a variant reading of the latter. In other words, it is also possible to interpret it in the same way, as “body, physical appearance.” To the latter interpretation compare the translation and comments of LEICK, Sex and Eroticism, 157–158. 36 HARRIS, Inanna–Ishtar as Paradox, 277. 37 ELIADE, The Two and the One, 113. 38 In connection with the procession of the hymn Iddin-Dagan A, Barbara Böck has recently suggested that the main purpose of this ritual was the temporal abolishment of the accepted social norms and roles, and their subsequent renewal, reestablishment, which reaffirmed the appropriate social structure and order, see BÖCK, Überlegungen zu einem Kultfest, esp. 33. On the “temporal disorder” and the subsequent renewal of the “normal conditions” also manifesting themselves in the ritual inversions described by this hymn, see already HARRIS, InannaIshtar as Paradox, 274 with note 70, who in turn cites the conclusion of the classic study of Umberto Eco (ECO, The Frames of Comic Freedom, esp. 6–7) on carnivalesque behavior (which is often paired with cross-dressing or symbolic cross-gendered activities, on the latter elements see IVANOV, The Semiotic Theory of Carnival, 13–16). All the mentioned works, regarding their considerations about social structure and social disorder, are based upon the basic considerations of post-structural anthropology on which, in general, see the influential studies of Victor Turner (e.g. TURNER, The Ritual Process, esp. the Chapter “Liminality and Communitas”). In the case of the hymn Iddin-Dagan A, we might say that the social structure and norms are indeed reestablished during the subsequent feast, which follows the sacred marriage of the king and the goddess (on this function and meaning of feasts and feasting in general see DIETLER, Theorizing Feasts, 65–72). However, regarding the essential goal of this ritual, namely, the direct communication and union with the divine, it is the state of liminality, achieved by the reversal of gender roles, and also manifesting itself in the person or “body” of the devotees, which is of vital concern here. This is the exact state which allows the temporal slurring of the boundaries between the human and the divine world, which, in turn, enables the king to get into direct contact with the goddess, and moreover, this is the state in which (as a beautiful example of

Moreover, in many cultures, the person who achieved this state was also thought to be able to communicate with the divine sphere, and often mediate between the human and the divine worlds. To quote a quite suggestive example, Firmicus Maternus describing the “impure” and “unchaste” galli, priests of Cybele and Attis in the mid-fourth century A.D., representing similar ecstatic practice and gender transgression, wrote that:
They wear effeminately nursed hair and dress in soft clothes. They can barely hold their heads up on their limp necks. Then, having made themselves alien to masculinity, swept up by playing flutes, they call their Goddess to fill them with an unholy spirit so as to seemingly predict the future to idle men (De errore profanarum religiorum 4.2).39
One might also recall the famous second-century novel of Apuleius, the Metamorphoses (also known as the The Golden Ass), which provides an even more detailed description of the appearance of the galli, and of the ritual acts performed by them:
The following day they went out, wearing various colored undergarments with turbans and saffron robes and linen garments thrown over them, and every one hideously made up, their faces crazy with muddy paints and their eyes artfully lined. Some wore tunics, fastened with belts, with purple stripes flowing in every direction like spears and yellow shoes on their feet. They put the goddess, draped in a silk cloak, on my back to carry, and with their arms bared to the shoulders, hoisting enormous swords and battle-axes, they leapt about shouting [evantes], raving in a religious dance to the singing of pipes. After wandering by not a few cottages, we arrived at some villas of landowners, and entering

communitas), at least for some brief moment, even the common people are able to be in touch with the divine. According to lines 117–119 (after the discussed ritual procession), at night, during sleep, “Those, who sleep on the roofs and those who sleep by the walls step up before her [...] and bring her their cases She makes her order known...” So Inana communicates with and judges the people (“who sleep on the roofs and who sleep by the walls,” that is, regardless their social standing) in their dreams, half-way between the terrestrial and the divine worlds. Of course, this kind of communication has to be differentiated from the one achieved by the king, who even exceeds the state of communitas and, according to the marriage metaphor, is capable to unite with the goddess. This clear distinction is also apparent from the following passage of the Sumerian epic known as Enmerkar and Enšuhgirina (ETCSL 1.8.2.4), where the Lord of Aratta, competing with Enmerkar, the ruler of Uruk for the favors of the goddess, referring to the means of contact with Inana, describes the same situation: “He may meet with Inana in his dreams at night, but I shall converse with Inana between her gleaming legs” (lines 31–32, see also VANSTIPHOUT, Epics of Sumerian Kings, 31–32). 39 Translated by Clarence Forbes, (FORBES, Firmicus Maternus, 50–51). For a more detailed analysis of the quoted passage, and about the origin, history and peculiarities of the institution of the galli, examined as a representative example of ritual gender transgression see ROSCOE, Priests of the Goddess, esp. 195–202.

the first one, they immediately flew around every which way, howling [ululatibus] cacophonously. For a long time they would hang their heads down on their necks and with quick, twisting motions whirl their hanging hair around in circles and sometimes assail their flesh with bites. At last, with a two-edged axe that they carried, everyone cut their arms. Then, from among them, one of these pouring forth in raving pretended to be stricken with madness [vecordiam] and affected repeated gasps from the depth of his breast, as if filled with the power of a divine spirit—as if, in other words, the presence of a god were not accustomed to make men better but weaker and ill! ... You could see, by the cutting of the swords and the blows of the whips, the soil become wet with the filthy blood of the effeminates (8.27–28).40
The further comparison of the latter texts with the above quoted passage of the hymn of Iddin-Dagan lies beyond the scope and limits of this paper.41 As for now, it would be enough to state, that assinu-s and kurgarrû-s (who, actually, well fit in the category of the tertium sexus, the third gender),42 as a result of their special social and gender role (so that they were men clothed as both men and women or, according to other sources, at times only as women, and acted

40 English translation of William Adlington (ADLINGTON, The Golden Ass, 391). On the description of Apuleius in a cross-cultural context see ROSCOE, Priests of the Goddess, 202; and for a more detailed analysis see BENKO, The Virgin Goddess, 72–78, with further literature. 41 The characteristics of the devotees of Inana/Ištar that were described above are often compared with the seemingly similar peculiarities of the galli, see for instance COOPER, Sacred Marriage and Popular Cult, 93; and GRONEBERG, Lob der Ištar, 18, and sometimes also with other cults known to had involved the cultic transvestism or cross-dressing of the participants (for example the cult of the “Hermaphrodite or Bearded Aphrodite” (Venus Barbata) in ancient Cyprus, see GRONEBERG, Die sumerische-akkadische Inanna/Ištar, 28; and GRONEBERG, Lob der Ištar, 15–16). Albeit many of these characteristics seems to be typical features of the ecstatic cults in general, it was recently assumed by Mary M. Bachvarova in a comparative study on Ancient Near Eastern and Greek lamentation (BACHVAROVA, Sumerian Gala Priests) that the similarities of the cultic functionaries of Ištar and the galli, the effeminate eunuch priests of Anatolian origin are “more than typological,” and must be at least in part the result of direct contact across the Mediterranean, see BACHVAROVA, Sumerian Gala Priests, esp. 18–22 and 3639. The later study concentrated primarily on role of the g a l a (Akkadian kalû), the Mesopotamian lamentation priests with ambiguous gender identity who were also closely connected with Inana/Ištar, and traditionally used e m e - s a l , the so-called Sumerian woman’s language. On the g a l a in general see among others COOPER, Genre, Gender, 42–45; BACHVAROVA, Sumerian Gala Priests, 19–22; and also TEPPO, Sacred marriage, 83–84; and compare also RUBIO, Inanna and Dumuzi, 270, with the discussion of the Sumerian cuneiform sign for g a l a , which is a combination of the signs for “penis” and “anus.” It is also worth mentioning that a g a l a appears in the Sumerian version of the myth of Inana’s Descent, as one of the savers of the goddess—on the latter episode see note 44 and also BACHVAROVA, Sumerian Gala Priests, 33–34. 42 For the general concept of a third gender, and its applicability in Ancient Near Eastern context see MCCAFFREY, Gender Ambiguity in Mesopotamia, 385–391. On the devotees of Inana/Ištar, as members of the third gender category, see: TEPPO, Sacred marriage, 89–91.

both as men and women) were, just like their goddess, also capable to transgress the boundaries not only between sexes, but also between the transcendental spheres.43 So it is not a coincidence that in the Sumerian myth of Inana’s Descent to the Underworld, the k u r ǧ ar a (Akkadian kurgarrû) and the g al atu r - r a (Akkadian kalû) while in the Akkadian version of the same story the assinnu44 are the ones who finally save the life of their goddess, because they are the only ones among both gods and humans who are able to pass through the gates of the Underworld (without even being noticed), and also, they are able to come back from the Land of No Return.45 To quote the Sumerian version,

43 The idea according to which gender transgression enables a person to communicate not only with the divine, but also with the dead, is again a widespread, one might say universal one, which is widely attested in the traditional shamanistic cults around the world (see for instance the impressive amount of material collected and discussed in BAUMANN, Das Doppelte Geschlecht, 15–39), and also tangible in Ancient Near Eastern ritual lamentation, see BACHVAROVA, Sumerian Gala Priests. On the cross-dressing of the shamans, as a characteristic that further enables them to mediate between the various (transcendental) spheres, see also ELIADE, The Two and the One, esp. 377. 44 According to the version from Nineveh (CT 15, 46: Rv. 12). The Assur-manuscript of the same text has kulu’u instead of assinnu here (KAR 1 Rv. 6). Compare line 92 of the composite text in LAPINKIVI, The Neo-Assyrian Myth, 19. The kulu’u was also a member of the temple-personnel of Ištar, who performed various dances and music, and was in turn equated with the assinnu in the lexical lists (lu2[u r -SAL] = kulu’u, lu2u r -SAL = assinnu: Igituh short version, 265–266, on the Sumerian expression see note 26). Regarding his/her gender role, compare also the following statement of a Middle-Babylonian letter (AfO 10 3: 21): “He is a kulu’u, not a (he-)man” (kulu’u la zikaru šû), see CAD K 529, sub. kulu’u, also for further references. 45 The cultic functionaries appearing in this myth, as it was already stated, to some extent embodied the characteristics and abilities of the goddess, in order to unite with her. She is in turn, due to her essentially liminal nature, shattered the boundaries between the realms of the living and the dead. This fact clearly manifests itself in the Sumerian and Akkadian myths of her descent to the Underworld and her subsequent resurrection, stories which based again on the observation of the periodical disappearance and transformation of the planet Venus, see already HEIMPEL, A Catalog of Near Eastern Venus Deities, 9; more recently WESTENHOLZ, Inanna and Ishtar, 335, and also note 32 of present article. The myth of Inana and Enki, which contains the famous enumeration of the m e , the divine powers or, according to another interpretation, the roles and rituals performed by the worshipers of the goddess (on the latter possibility see GLASSNER, Inanna et les me, esp. 56–57; and BARRETT, Was Dust Their Food, 22), also mentions the “descending to the Netherworld” (k u r e d 3 - d e 3 ) and the “ascending to the Netherworld” (k u r e d 3 - d a ) as activities belonging to the domain of Inana, and, as already mentioned (see note 33), connected with the ritual performance of the k u r ǧ a r a (Inana and Enki, ETCSL 1.3.1, Segment F 23 and Segment J 19–20, see also FARBER-FLÜGGE, Der Mythos “Inanna und Enki,” 28–29 and 54–55.

One might also recall the image of the famous Burney Relief (Fig. 3) which, together with the similar depictions of a winged, taloned goddess, represents an underworldform of Inana/Ištar, a liminal figure who, to quote Rivka Harris, also “breaks down the boundary between the species” (HARRIS, Inanna–Ishtar as Paradox, 272).

Prophets or Prophetesses?
Such a person is obviously more “suitable” to fill the role of a prophet, and also, while embodying the deity, to transmit her messages. Therefore it is not surprising that, among the Mesopotamian prophets known by name, we find assinnu-s (in the prophetic records from Mari),47 and that in the Neo-Assyrian corpus we can also determine a few with clearly indicated “ambiguous” gender role48they are the ones in the following tablet who, for example, have male names, but appear with female determinatives.

47 In ARM 26, 198, 212, 213 and possibly also in ARM 26, 197, on the latter see DURAND, Archives epistolaires de Mari (=ARM 26), 425. The assinnu-s were, according to the first three letters, directly connected to the cult and temple of the goddess Annunītum. Moreover, an administrative texts from Mari (M. 11299) lists the assinnum-s among the receivers of certain provisions from the Annunītum-temple, see DURAND, Archives epistolaires de Mari (=ARM 26), 399. On the OldBabylonian assinnum as professional prophet, and therefore gender ambiguity as an integral part of professional prophecy in Mari, see HUFFMON, The assinnum as Prophet. The only counter-argument to this theory, namely that (according to a note of Jonathan Stökl, see STÖKL, Female Prophets, 55 note 50) the “cross-dressing behavior” of the assinnu(m) does not attested prior to the first millennium, is inaccurate, see the explicit references to this phenomenon in the second millennium hymn of king Iddin-Dagan quoted earlier in the present study, or the mentioning of the assinnu in the late Old-Babylonian hymn Ištar-Louvre also in the context of a “transvestite ritual” and of an ecstatic performance note 33 and also GRONEBERG, Lob der Ištar, 17–18 for the summary of the passage in question. 48 On the “uncertain” gender of some Assyrian prophets see already (inter alia) PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, 48; NISSINEN, The Socioreligious Role, 94; and also TEPPO, Women and their Agency, 84–85; and TEPPO, Sacred Marriage, 82.

Of course, we are not inclined to presume that the “genderless state” described above was an exclusive criteria in the case of the personage of the prophets (as we will see, at times even ordinary people, non-professionals, were considered to be able to transmit a divine message), but it had to be a state which made a given person so to say more suitable to function like that, because, in light of the former facts, such persons even more embodied the general concept of liminality (which was attributed to the cultic functionaries of Ištar as a whole). So the common assumption that, in Neo-Assyrian times, the prophets of Ištar were, according to their names, predominantly women,50 should be treated

49 Based mainly on the data tabulated in TEPPO, Women and their Agency, 87. By contrast, beyond those prophets, whose names have been included in the above tablet, there are four male prophets, whose names have survived, so the majority of named prophets in the NeoAssyrian texts are female, see recently STÖKL, Female Prophecy, esp. 55–56, with note 44 about the named male prophets and for previous literature. See also NISSINEN, The Socioreligious Role, 94; and TEPPO, Women and their Agency, 88 with note 93 on the rather problematic definition of the gender role of a certain prophet/prophetess named Issār-lā-tašīyat (who appears in SAA 9, Collection 1.1, line 28’–29’ with masculine and divine determinatives written over the originally written female determinative before his/her name, see PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, 5). Whether it is a simple correction, or should be understood as another allusion to the gender-transgression of this person, it is difficult to ascertain, and in this respect, his/her designation as “d u m u Arbail,” considering that the above mentioned Bayâ worn the same title, cannot be helpful either. Because of these uncertainties, Issār-lā-tašīyat is not included in the above tablet. 50 For example PARPOLA, Assyrian Prophecies, 48; NISSINEN, The Socireligious Role, 109; TEPPO, Women and their Agency, 86; PONGRATZ-LEISTEN, Cassandra's Colleagues, esp. 24 and 27; DE VILLIERS, The Origin of Prophetism, 3; and also a recent study by Jonathan Stökl for the proportional differences between men and women among Old-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian prophets (STÖKL, Female Prophets on the Neo-Assyrian material see esp. 54–56). Note also the remarkable case of a Neo-Assyrian administrative list of female palace personnel (SAA 7 24) in which 13 kurgarrû appear with female determinative (obv. 24) and counted among the female musicians. It is again difficult to answer, whether this might be seen as an exceptional attestation of female kurgarrû-s (who are otherwise unknown), or they should be interpreted as trans-gendered persons who were, at least in the administrative record, lacking further categories, considered to be female and included in the homogenous group of the female singers.

more carefully, bearing in mind, that in a case like that a name is not necessarily conclusive evidence regarding the biological gender of a person – as the following example from Mari clearly illustrates. The famous early-dynastic votive statue of a cultic singer named Ur-Nanše from the city of Mari, from around 2400 B.C.,51 depicts a person who thus bears a typical male name, while, according this image, where he is represented in a male garment, but also with clear female characteristics, he has to be considered either a hermaphrodite, a cross-dressed female, or probably a male castrated before his puberty. In this case the name-giving was apparently based primarily not on his/her physical sex, but rather on the role he/she played in the society, the way, in which he/she acted, and according to that Ur-Nanše, who is wearing a male garment, was considered as male. There is one last important lesson derived from this image: the fact that UrNanše had the opportunity to erect a votive statue in a temple, consequently, even as a person with elusive gender, he was a respected member of the society, who acquired both wealth and considerable social prestige. Likewise the prophets of the goddess Inana/Ištar, although liminal or marginal in nature, were in neither way marginalized, but rather they were integrated into the temple community and into society as a whole.52 Moreover, their profession assured stable social standing and respect, so we can safely assume that they were much more admired than feared.
Prophecy and Divination in the Neo-Assyrian Royal Court
Since these prophets and their prophecies, referring to diverse state matters, were essentially ideological and political tools in the hands of state authority, they formed part of another special community: the inner circle of professional diviners and scholars of the Neo-Assyrian royal court. According to the famous Cuthean Legend of Narām-Sîn,53 the diverse divinatory acts that anticipated sig

nificant royal decisions were indispensable and integral parts of good government and, as it can be attested from the Old-Babylonian period onwards, played indeed a traditional role in the decision-making procedures of royal courts.54 However, in contrast with former periods, the cuneiform sources from the NeoAssyrian capitals present increasing references to various divinatory methods: interpretation of astral phenomena, extispicy, dream interpretation, and prophecy. These references stem, on the one hand, from the correspondence of the Assyrian rulers with scholars of the royal court,55 and, on the other hand, from technical texts such as the “Queries to the Sun god Šamaš”.56 From the reign of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal, the royal archives of Nineveh have yielded a large number of letters written to the kings by various people, commonly defined as “scholars,” who were experts in the fields of Mesopotamian scholarship (extispicy, astrology, exorcism and magic, medicine and lamentations) and were attached to the court for royal service. In these letters, scholars informed the king about the interpretation of the meaning of celestial phenomena and other events, so they gave him advices on his decisions in the fields of politics, religion, or military strategy.57 During his eighth campaign, Sargon II (721–705 B.C.) recognized messages of the gods:
At the exalted command of Nabû and Marduk, who had moved on a path in a stellar station, (which meant) the advancement of my weapons; and further, as a favourable sign for the obtaining of total power, the god Magur, lord of the tiara, made an eclipse that lasted one watch, to announce the destruction of Gutium.

warrior Šamaš, who wrote encouraging omens on the exta that he would walk at may side, ... I set out and took the road to Muṣaṣir.58
As may be seen, we have here the record of two complete astrological observations. The first is relevant to the course of the planets Mercury and Jupiter, the second concerns a lunar eclipse, with Magur standing as a synonym of the divine name of the Moon god Sîn.59 Finally, we have the confirmation of these astrological observations by means of an extispicy, from the Sun god. It is still an open question whether or not the succession of Esarhaddon was eventually legitimate, in the wake of the murder of his father, Sennacherib (704–681 B.C.) in a plot led by his half-brother, Arda-Mulissi.60 In any case, in his royal inscription Esarhaddon describes the auspicious omens foretelling his reign—astral phenomena of Sîn and Šamaš (Moon and Sun), the Venus and the Mars, prophecies, dreams and ominous utterances.
In [order] to give the land and the people verdicts of truth and justice, the gods [Sîn and] Šamaš, the twin gods, took the road of truth and justice monthly. They made (their simultaneous) appearance regularly on days [first]61 and fourteen. Venus, the brightest of the stars, was seen in the west, [in the Path] of the Ea-stars. Concerning the securing of the land (and) the reconciliation of its gods, it (Venus) reached (its) hypsoma and then disappeared. Mars, the giver of decisions on the land Amurru, shone brightly in the Path of the Ea-stars (and) it revealed its sign concerning the strengthening of the ruler and his land. Messages from ecstatics (mahhû) were constantly available. Good signs occurred for me concerning the securing of the foundation of the throne of my priestly office forever. Favorable omens concerning the securing of my throne (and) the prolongation of my reign came to me in dreams and through oracles. I saw those (signs), was encouraged, and my mood felt good. (LEICHTY, The Royal Inscriptions of Esarhaddon, no. 57, i 3’−ii 26. Highlights by the present authors)
By the end of the Sargonid dynasty (7th century B.C.), all political decisions were preceded by one or more divinatory procedures. During the reign of Esarhaddon we could identify a royal will to collect all the scholars and diviners of the em

pire in the Assyrian metropolises, or at least to exercise imperial control over the work of these experts. Rich sources for this process are the letters of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal with the scholars and diviners of the Assyrian royal court—and with those officials who were assigned to control their work.62 For the goodwill of the empire, diviners and direct mediums of the divine will worked in parallel in Nineveh—in a concentration never seen before.63 One of the most important questions concerns the prophets’ proper place and status within this particular community. First and foremost, we have to investigate what was the social rank of the prophets. Were they considered to be lower than scholars or divinatory experts of the Neo-Assyrian royal court, or in other words: were the Neo-Assyrian prophecies subordinated to the other, inductive means of divine communication? As it is commonly assumed, although the prophetic oracles were taken seriously by the political authorities in the state of Old-Babylonian Mari, they were not the first or preferred means of communication with the gods.64 Prophetic messages were reported to the king in the form of letters, and in this official communication they were, in contrast to other kinds of divinatory methods, subject to review by technical divination (normally by extispicy). The Mari letters also report that, either voluntarily or as a requirement, the prophets submitted a bit of their hair and a trimming from their garment (sissiktum). This “hair and hem” were surely used in technical divination, as a means of verifying the authenticity of the prophetic word.65 So in some cases the writers of the Mari letters left it to the king whether he intended to trust the prophecy or not, or they advised him not to proceed further without extispicy.66 Was the status of the Assyrian prophets in the hierarchy of divinatory experts similar to their Mari colleagues?

62 A characteristic anonymous denunciation is a letter (SAA 16 65) in which the goldsmith of the queen is accused of buying a Babylonian scholar to teach his son the interpretation of astrological and medical texts. In a letter to his father, the Babylonian crown prince complains about astrologers and other diviners who didn’t report their observations to the royal court (SAA 16 21). For the royal will to collect scholars from all over the world, see the report of Marduk-šapik-zēri (SAA 10 160) and the study of RADNER, Royal Decision-making, 366–368. 63 RADNER, Royal Decision-making, 368–370.

The suggestive allusions regarding this subordinate status can seem almost obvious when one reads a text like the following Neo-Assyrian letter, in which a certain Bēl-ušēzib,67 a prominent astrologer of the king Esarhaddon, asks the ruler why he had summoned prophets and prophetesses to assist in the understanding and dealing with troubles he had reported. He asks:
Why has the king ... not summoned me? (SAA 10 109.)
So he seems to be saying that he would have been more effective than the prophets, even if they may have been present as a group. This latter statement coincides with the above mentioned Old-Babylonian sources from Mari. We would say, based on these texts, that in the intellectual milieu of first millenium Assyria, prophetic oracles enjoyed a second rank position compared to the work of court scholars. In this respect, it would also seem relevant that the divinatory method practiced by prophets is based purely on verbalism, so in the absence of a written lore learned and used by them.68 In addition, although it cannot be stated conclusively that prophets received no training or education at all (probably at times they had to undergo some form of preparation—as we could hear about prophetic schools even in the Bible69), as far as we can judge from our sources, the Assyrian prophets were mostly illit

67 “Bēl-ušēzib is the only non-Assyrian scholar belonging to the ‘inner circle’ of scholars who are engaged in a more or less regular correspondence with Esarhaddon. Judging from the vast amount of astronomical phenomena and astrological omens dealt with in his letters, astronomy and astrology must have been his main fields of expertise.” FABRITIUS, Bēl-ušēzib, 338. 68 The five scholarly disciplines of Assyrian wisdom were the āšipūtu (‘exorcistic lore’), the asûtu (‘medicine, therapy’), the bārûtu (‘divination,’ ‘extispicy’), the kalûtu (‘science of lamentation’), and ṭupšarrūtu (‘science of the scribes,’ ‘astrology’) (JEAN, Divination and Oracles, 267). For the scholarly practice and written lore of the Mesopotamian experts of divination, see VELDHUIS, The Theory and Knowledge, 80–87. 69 In Ramah 1Samuel 19,18–24: “So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. And it was told Saul, saying, ‘Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.’ And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, ‘Where are Samuel and David?’ And one said, ‘Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.’ And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?”

erate. So their oracles had to be recorded (if not interpreted) by more learned scribes. In contrast to the prophecies, the reliability of technical or inductive divination (first and foremost astrology and extispicy) is based on a written, technical lore, which gained recognition from a tradition written down and handed over by scholars throughout centuries,70 and according to their scholarly tradition, it passed down from the very ancient times or had a divine origin.71 Bearing all these facts in mind, it would surely seem surprising, at least at first glance, that no other Neo-Assyrian sources support the hypothesis formulated above. Although the previously outlined social status of professional prophets and that of court scientists differed of course in many respect—the latters, as members of the royal court, were literally closer to the king, and consequently they surely could exert greater influence on his decisions—apart from the quoted lament of this certain Bēl-ušēzib, there is not any indication in the vast Neo-Assyrian text corpus, from which we could conclude or even suppose that prophecy was seen as a subordinate type of oracle. On the contrary, the picture that can be drawn from the literary and epistolary allusions, dated to the reigns of the two last major Assyrian monarchs (Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal), tends to represent a radically different situation from the one observed in Mari. The prophecy and the technical divinatory processes enjoyed equal importance in the eyes of the Neo-Assyrian rulers. Moreover, there is no sign of competition between the experts of intuitive and inductive divination: the scholars of the royal court and the prophets of the temples were considered—so to say—as colloquial equals. Investigating the key factor of the verification or checking of the results of a certain divinatory act, it appears that in the case of Mesopotamian scientific disciplines and scholars the checking of a given sign and its interpretations are also frequent. Moreover, in his fear to be fooled, Esarhaddon had the very habit to check and re-check the predictions and prescriptions (as in SAA 10 42). To quote another telling source, the second oracle question from the edition of Wilfred G. Lambert asks the gods Šamaš and Adad to confirm—by means of extispicy—the coming of an eclipse with ominous consequences.72 How could a prophecy be authorized, and do we know anything about false prophecies—those did not passed through a sieve, and proved to be false?

this respect, the great collections of prophetic oracles seem to be largely irrelevant, because these were specifically drawn up for archival storage and for reference purposes—moreover, three out of the four preserved collections were compiled by the same scribe.73 It is also commonly stated that these collections can rather be defined as literary compositions than as verbatim reports of the spoken words of a prophet, although their typical formulas seemingly indicate direct speech, as in, for example, the prophetic message of Ištar of Arbela:
I am Ištar of [Arbela]. Esarhaddon, king of A[ssyria]! In the Inner City (Aššur), Nineveh, Calah and Arbela I will give long days and everlasting years to Esarhaddon, my king. I am your great midwife; I am your excellent wet nurse. For long days and everlasting years I have established your throne under the great heavens. I watch in a golden chamber in the midst of the heavens; I let the lamp of amber shine before Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, and I watch him like the crown of my head. Have no fear, my king! SAA 9, Collection 1, no. 6. (K 4310 col. III, lines 7'-30'.)
In short, the extant Assyrian oracles of the collections are always scribal works, literal imitations of a prophetic language, rather than actually proclaimed prophecies, and are also in some extent the interpretations of a given prophecy of a given scribe. Consequently, the collections contain prophecies which have not only proven to be authentic, but also worth reckoning on archival tablets, as well as written in an elaborate literary style.74 But the fact that prophetic messages were sometimes regarded suspicious, and also proved to be false, is clear from sources like the famous succession treaty of Esarhaddon, which states that:
any improper word heard from the mouth of prophets, ecstatics or of an inquirer of oracles should not be concealed by the king (SAA 2 6 §10, 116−117).
A prophecy against the king could thus be interpreted as a plot by the subjects, because, as we have already mentioned, these prophets were seldom uttering

alone, but preferably in public places—of course, mostly in temples—where people would hear their speech.75 Consequently, the rare allusions to the verification of prophetic utterances are only preserved to us in the cases of the already mentioned cases of dangers and unfavourable prophecies against the king—confirming the opinion of Martii Nissinen about the pecularities of Neo-Assyrian prophetic genre: “true prophecy cannot, in any instance, be directed against the king.”76 A significant case occurred in the North Mesopotamian city of Harran. This city was the most important center in the western provinces of the Empire, the spindle side hinterland of Esarhaddon,77 and the prominent cult center of the Moon god.78 This case is known to us from letters (SAA 16 59−61), and has prime importance regarding the question of the verification of an oracle which seemed suspicious. In these letters a certain Nabû-rēhtu-uṣur—who is otherwise unknown to us79—reports to Esarhaddon about a conspiracy against the king, which was led by a certain Sasî.80 This case is of vital concernment to us in another respect too, because at first glance it seemingly contradicts one of our basic previous conclusions, namely, that virtually every prophecy stemmed from the messages and nature of the goddess Ištar, and that even in those cases, where the divine speaker is another deity, the transmitter of his or her words were exclusively and officially connected to the cult of the goddess of contradictions and boundaries.81 One letter (SAA 16 59)82 reports a divine word from the god Nusku, the son of the Moon god83 through a slave girl—who is a “lay prophet.”84 This slave girl

aroused in the outskirts of Harran and delivered the oracle of Nusku, according to which:
The kingship is for Sasî! I (Nusku) will destroy the name and seed of Sennacherib (rev. 4'-5.')
The king is advised to summon the girl and to perform a ritual—probably an extispicy—that is, to check a given prediction by another means of divine communication, which was, as we have seen, a common method in the cases of ambiguous results of all other kinds of divination, too. Does it all mean that prophecy (at least in this particular case), due to its very nature, was credited with lower accuracy than the court-related methods of inductive or, in other words, technical divination? Definitely not. However, the situation is even more complicated, and actually reveals another method, by which the accuracy of a given prophecy could have been put to the test. We have to quote the beginning of the letter. According to that:
Nikkal [has revealed] those who sinned against [your father’s] goodness, and your [father’s ] and your own treaty. Destroy their temple, name and seed from your palace! May the accomplices of Sasî [die quickly]! ... Obey the words of Nikkal! (SAA 16 59, obv. 4−7)
As we can see, although Nabû-rēhtu-uṣur did take the former oracle of Nusku seriously (consequently, and also as it was obligatory, he reported it to the king), he nonetheless seems to be unwilling to acknowledge the divine authority behind the words of the slave girl. He seems reluctant, first and foremost, because those words opposed the king, secondly, because they were spoken by a non-professional, and thirdly, because the oracle-giver god, who was the son of the Moon god and his spouse, the goddess Nikkal, who is also mentioned here, held a lower status in the divine hierarchy. However, the verification or checking of Nusku’s oracle, and the consequence, namely, that it proved to be false, is based primarily not on the check-up by means of technical divination (what might indicate the higher authority of the latter), but rather on another prophetic oracle, and this one was certainly spoken by a professional, inside the institutional framework. Accordingly, this second oracle overruled the alleged words of the god Nusku. Although in the Mesopotamian pantheon Ningal (the Assyrian Nikkal), the consort of the Moon god, was the most clearly articulated female aspect of the moon, as the divine manifestation of this heavenly body, she also partakes in its bipolar nature. Presumably this was the essential fact which served as a theological basis of her equation with Ištar, the goddess who, as we have seen, as the equivalent of the planet Venus, also united the supposed male and female aspects of this celestial body.

Prophetesses and Female Ecstatics in the Neo-Assyrian Empire  33
To sum up, even in this particular case the authentic prophecy stems from a goddess, who unites gender and other socially constructed roles, whereby she also possesses the quality to transgress the boundaries, and to act as mediator between the divine and human worlds. A goddess, who was already equated with Ištar by the Assyrians themselves,85 and a goddess who, almost a thousand years later, reappears in the account of a fourth-century historian, Aelius Spartianus, still as a divinity of bipolar or, as it is commonly stated, “bisexual nature.”86 When Spartianus (articulating, of course, his own age’s criticism towards the sharp cultural differences) comments on the cult of Harran, the still prominent religious center of the Moon god, who was also endowed with oracular power, he states, that:
All the learned, but particularly the inhabitants of Carrhae (Harran) hold that those who think that the deity ought to be called Luna, with the name and sex of a woman, are subject to women and always their slaves, but those who believe that the deity is male, never suffer the ambushes of women. (Aelius Spartianus Caracalla vii, 3-4)
