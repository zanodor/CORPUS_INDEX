Author's Note
Beginning as a vague idea some ten years before
it commanded my full attention, Leadership Se
crets ofAttila the Hun occupied my early mornings, late
nights and weekends for nearly a year. During that period, there were a number of people who provided the encouragement and support necessary to sustain me. I remain indebted to them.
First, I want to express my appreciation to Cheryl,
Justin, Jaime and Jeremy, who are not just my family but friends and confidants who provided enduring sanction and assistance throughout the penning of the manuscript and its subsequent revisions. Justin, though
just ten years old when this project began, was especially helpful in conceptualizing the book's metaphoric
leader, Attila. Cheryl provided penetrating insight into the behavior of leaders from all walks of life. Jaime

LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
and Jeremy gave the project the kind of unreserved support that is found only in the innocence of child
hood or the magnanimity of adult maturity. Aniko Myers and Dave Handley provided some ex
cellent background material on Attila—no small feat,
since there isn't an abundance of it. Lee Allen, an accomplished military commander and a former army
colleague, acted the role of mentor, seeing that I didn't
stray too far from the book's primary theme.
In the autumn of 1984, 1 made several attempts on my own and through a literary agent in Boston to gain
the interest of virtually any publishing house that would
agree to print the book. After being rejected by sev
enteen publishers for seventeen different reasons, many of them conflicting, I was informed by a second literary agent that my work was one he could not represent. I
decided, therefore, to have the good people at Publish
er's Press in Salt Lake City print the book at my own
expense. My intent became one of providing copies, over time, to people who had an interest in a book that was an audacious break from traditional leadership
literature. Concurrent with these events, David Copus, a prom
inent Washington, D.C., attorney, read the original manuscript and suggested I send a copy to H. Ross
Perot. Soon after the limited first printing, I sent Ross a copy with David's compliments. Ross thought enough of the book to call and discuss it with me. His purchase of seven hundred copies of the first edition, which
has since been publicly revealed in Albert Lee's book Call Me Roger, inspired me to continue disseminating
the book and to also search out possibilities for wider
distribution.



AUTHOR'S NOTE
Over the course of the next three years, Leadership Secrets found its way into the hands of a few thousand Americans, ranging from the most wealthy and influ
ential to the ordinary man on the street. This was a
tremendous experience for Cheryl and me. We hadn't advertised the book or provided any information in
either of the first two printings as to how one might
purchase additional copies, yet would-be readers continued to track us down. We have enjoyed our conversations and correspondence with them. I hope the book has added some value to their lives and thank them for their patronage and words of encouragement. The
time during which we distributed Leadership Secrets
out of a small office in our home—working together with Justin, Jaime and Jeremy to take orders and to
package and ship them—is one of the cherished periods we have shared as a family.
In May of 1988, the fortunes of Leadership Secrets were dramatically changed by an unexpected plaudit that appeared in the aforementioned Call Me Roger, a book that profiled the mismanagement of one of America's largest corporations, General Motors. Au
thor Albert Lee described the contretemps that developed when GM Chairman Roger Smith prohibited his
new business associate, Ross Perot, from distributing
five hundred copies of Leadership Secrets at a dinner attended by the managers of GM's new Saturn division. This was news to me. At the time, I had no idea that Albert Lee's complimentary words would eventually bring the book to the attention of a publisher who had
faith in its prospects, Warner Books. Thanks, Al!
The first step in the process was Dr. Hendrie Weisingei^s suggestion that I send a copy of Leadership Secrets
xi



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
to his literary agent, Richard Pine. A full two months passed before I overcame my fear of yet another re
jection and placed a call to Richard. Not surprisingly, he had never heard of my book but said he would take
a look at it. Richard, who is a wizard of his trade, placed
Leadership Secrets with Warner Books in less than two weeks. If this isn't record time in the publishing world,
it is in Cedar City, Utah, my hometown, where events
occur at a more leisurely pace. The people at Warner Books have been an absolute
delight to work with. I am especially appreciative of my editor, Rick Horgan, who has energetically added
his master's touch in polishing my work. Larry Kirsh
baum, Warner's president, has enthusiastically di
rected the overall activities related to this edition from
start to finish. They both are, quite simply, the kind of
efficacious people lots of us like to be around.
And finally, it has been my privilege to have had the
opportunity to be associated with Larry Wiesen over what is nearing a ten-year period at American Express and now Fireman's Fund. He has given me his confi
dence, trust, timely and wise counsel, personal ex
ample of integrity and the latitude that I might learn
and achieve many things that would have otherwise
quite possibly remained beyond my grasp.

Preface
Attila the Hun is a dubious character upon whom
to base a metaphor on leadership. He's been por
trayed throughout history as a barbaric, ugly little ty
rant whose hordes, in total disregard of accepted
principles of conservation, ruthlessly destroyed the
beautiful and tranquil countryside, then went on to
plunder and pillage numerous cities and villages in
habited by more civilized citizens of European nations.
Void of any characterization as a brilliant leader, a genius civilizer or a compassionate and adept king, the
sinister Attila is commonly used as a referent for en
tertaining satire and serves as a universally agreed upon
example of those qualities and attributes dreadfully abhorred in leaders of any generation, organization or
cause. Typically, leadership books are based on the lives
- xiii

and accomplishments of socially acceptable men and women who have reached the pinnacle of achievement
in business, athletics, medicine, entertainment, edu
cation, religion or the military. Many of these writings
prove to be worthwhile study; in them are valuable
lessons for our own leadership development.
It is, however, sometimes a painstaking challenge to
extract from these books the essence of the leadership
principles contained in them. Even more challenging
is the application of the thoughts in these books to our
own lives.
Leadership is the privilege to have the responsibility
to direct the actions of others in carrying out the pur
poses of the organization, at varying levels of authority
and with accountability for both successful and failed
endeavors. It does not constitute a model or system.
No model or system of leadership behaviors can an
ticipate the circumstances, conditions and situations
in which the leader must influence the actions of others.
An evaluation of leadership principles is an effective
base upon which to build other skills that may be im
portant to success in specialized fields.
For this very reason I have chosen Attila as the cen
tral figure for this book. His nation has long since vanished, nomadic Huns no longer roam, and he is a most
unlikely role model for anyone to emulate. But as I will show, his career presents a compelling and opportune forum for a primer on leadership.
Individually, the Huns were a spirited, perfidious people without common purpose other than to establish their next campsite. Commodities for internal trade
didn't exist, so they sought out villages to lay waste to in order to obtain booty that would later be used as

PREFACE
barter for food and other supplies necessary for their
survival.
There could be no greater leadership challenge than
faced the young Attila as he forged these barbaric hordes
into a nation of Huns. He was met with the perils, trials
and tribulations of masterful deceit not only from the
tribes and clans but also from his own brother and
uncles. His army marched against more-disciplined,
better-trained and -supplied forces.
Few, if any, of his subordinate chieftains shared Attila's dreams of world conquest and a Hunnish homeland. These chieftains had to be convinced, their
objections listened to and overcome. Their loyalty was
assured out of fear for their lives, awe of Attila's su
perior logic and greed at the prospect of more bountiful booty than could be obtained by other means. As a condition of a peace treaty, Attila once secured tribute payments from Theodosius II, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire. And, perhaps as a tired and aging king, Attila turned his army homeward at the
behest of the pope.
Seen in perspectives different from those who wrote
his history—much of which must be to some degree apocryphal, if not biased by political preferences

Attila might today be characterized as an entrepre
neur, diplomat, social reformer, statesman, civilizer,
brilliant field marshal and host of some terrific parties.
But I didn't choose Attila as the metaphoric char
acter of this book for any of these plausible labels or for the purpose of making him a cult hero in a modern age. Rather, Attila's robust life and controversial image
as a determined, tough, rugged and intriguing leader

formed challenging feats against "seemingly" insur
mountable odds —provides a compelling opportunity
for relating leadership fundamentals to a new gen
eration of leaders who have no fear of him and who might enjoy a novel pedagogic treatment of what can
otherwise be very mundane, unexciting reading. For those who have little knowledge of who Attila
was and for the purpose of establishing a basis for my metaphor, I have included a brief history of his life and
legend in the book's introduction. It is essential to point
out to the reader that even the most reputable histo
rians disagree on the size of Attila's army as well as
the total population of the Hunnish confederacy. In any case, their numbers have most likely been exaggerated in both this and other sources. It also seems reasonable to me that, if noted historians have had
difficulty estimating the size of his army, much of what
else has been recorded is subject to question and in
terpretation as well. And, while I have attempted to be
objective in establishing Attila as my metaphorical
leader, I have given him and his Huns a slightly more positive image than can perhaps be found elsewhere. Each chapter begins with a vignette based on ac
counts of Attila's life, which serves to establish the ref
erent situation and experience from which he lectures
on various leadership principles to his chieftains and
Huns in campfire settings. Having no direct relation
ship to familiar headlines and events in this day, these vignettes provide the reader with an opportunity to
visualize his own situation and prepare himself for
some aphorisms that relate to leadership success in
any age, society, organization or situation. The aphorisms spoken by Attila in this book have no

basis of authenticity as ever having been said by the
King of Huns. They are, rather, ones that I have written
based upon my own experiences, research and observations. They have been reviewed and tested by some demanding critics and were only incorporated after
having survived considerable scrutiny.
In any work of this nature, one is bound to identify some poignant thoughts that remain after the writing is completed. A few of my finest remnants are provided under theme headings I have collective
ly coined "Attilaisms." They conclude this leadership
primer.
There has been no attempt in this effort to identify
any past, present or future leaders as "Attilas." Simi
larly, no attempt has been made to identify "Attila"
organizations. This would only distract from the book's
intended message and result in a tireless, moot debate. There is no magical formula for developing leadership abilities contained in this book. Any extraordinary
method for accelerating the acquisition of leadership
skills, attitudes and attributes is yet to be discovered.
For the time being, as in centuries past, it seems to be
the nature of the human being to acquire leadership
traits a little at a time—building upon previously learned
precepts. I do not consider the precepts and concepts in this
book as the definitive statements of all that is known about leading people. This is, however, a comprehensive, fundamental beginning to an understanding of
what we commonly refer to as leadership.

Introduction:
In Search ofAttila
ambling into history as a nation of mysterious
origin, the Huns were a nomadic, multiracial and
multilingual conglomeration of tribes. Whether their
origin was on the European side of the Urals or from
Turkic or Asiatic descent is left largely to rarely tran
scribed and sometimes confused oral history.
Tied to grazing, purposeless in regard to national
goals, the Huns were a nation of loosely bound tribes
in perpetual migration. Their warriors rode ahead of the women, who made their homes in skin-covered chariots overflowing with children and the pillage of
victory. Their long migrations were monotonous wanderings stimulated in spirit by endless songs paying reverence to nature. Above these songs rang out a steady cacophony of snorting horses and the cracking of whips.
1



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
Clad in the skins and furs of beasts, many of the
Huns were characterized by somber, yellowish skin, long arms, large chests and narrow, slanted eyes with a dull glitter of mingled cunning and cruelty. Their warriors had skulls deformed in childhood by a wooden apparatus held fast by leather thongs. The scant beards of the warriors were the result of their cheeks having
been seared with hot irons in their youth to retard the
growth of facial hair.
They ate raw meat toughened by having been carried in pouches between their thighs or between the flanks
of their horses. A portion of their nutrition came from
drinking mares' milk. The weapons of the horde were considered unso
phisticated and outlandish even in their own time. Their
spirit as warriors was driven by a lust for rapid and
sustained movement in pursuit of a paradise of glory
filled with pillage and booty.
To the civilized world they were barbarians not far removed from wild animals in both appearance and
life-style. The mere presence of the horde often instilled
sufficient terror in the people of a region that they
abandoned their villages without either resistance or subsequent reprisal. Out of this perplexing and barbaric past rose one of the most formidable leaders the world has known: Attila, King of Huns.
He was born in a chariot somewhere in the valley of the Danube around the year a.d. 395. Attila was the son of King Mundzuk and could trace his ancestry
some thirty-two generations. His was the family that maintained the integrity of the horde's bloodline and
distinctly Mongol characteristics.
2



INTRODUCTION: IN SEARCH OF ATTILA
Learning first to ride on the back of sheep, Attila
later developed extraordinary skills of horsemanship.
He also became superior in the use of the bow, lance,
lariat, sword and whip. These were skills of tradition
among his people and dutiful talents for one of noble
rank.
He developed a strong sense of pride in his personal
strength and a great disdain for the weak. His pride of
strength was often publicly displayed on adventurous hunting expeditions, on which he captured wolves and bears in nets, then disemboweled them with a short
dagger.
His strong bond and special relationship with his
father was prematurely shortened upon King Mund
zuk's death while Attila was still a lad. Thereafter, he
fell victim to the vicious mercies of his uncles, partic
ularly Rugila, successor to King Mundzuk's throne.
Attila's open criticism of Rugila's policy of entering
the horde into the service of foreign nations, whom Attila thought the Huns could easily defeat, changed
the course of his youth.
At twelve, Attila was sent as a child hostage to the
Roman court of Honorius. In return, Rugila received
a youth by the name of Aetius, in fulfillment of the exchange arrangement perpetuated by the Romans.
It was a sinister plan on the part of the empire. On the one hand, the empire taught hostages in its court the customs, traditions and pompous ways of its lux
urious life—traits these young hostages would carry
back to their own nation, thus serving to extend Roman
influence into foreign lands. On the other hand, the youth sent as hostages by the empire greatly enhanced its
espionage capabilities.

LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
Attila resisted the propaganda spewed at him by his
Roman mentors. He personally rejected everything about
them. Though he tried to ignite the spirit of resistance
among the other child hostages, his attempts failed.
On at least two occasions, Attila tried to escape. Failing
to gain freedom, he prowled the palace as if he were
a caged animal. His hatred for the empire's policies
and practices grew stronger day by day.
Captivity was a time of despair for the young Attila.
He had been betrayed by the self-serving Rugila. He was lonely for the Hunnish homeland and customs
more familiar to him.
Failing escape, Attila turned his attention to an in
tense study of the empire while outwardly ceasing to
struggle against his hostage status. He studied the Ro
mans' internal and foreign policies. He often secretly observed them in diplomatic conference with foreign
ministers. He studied the empire's military, observing
its strengths and vulnerabilities. He learned about lead
ership, protocol and other essentials suited to future
rulers and diplomats from skilled Romans.
It was in the Roman court that Attila conceived his
strategy to rule the world. His plan was methodical,
extraordinarily precise. It was not the plan of a blun
dering half-wit.
While Attila was in the court of Honorius, Aetius,
his lifelong nemesis, was serving similar time in the
court of King Rugila. Aetius was born into the family of Gaudentius, son of a German of Pannonia, who bore the titles "Master of the Horse" and "Count of Africa." His relationship with his father was, as was Attila's with his, abbreviated

INTRODUCTION: IN SEARCH OF ATTILA
by his father s death during a revolt of his own soldiers
in Gaul.
During his period as a child hostage, Aetius devel
oped a trusted relationship with King Rugila and other
Hunnish nobles. Likewise, he became a scholar of the
Huns—learning their customs, traditions and motives. They schooled him in the mastery of their weapons, taught him to hunt and to ride, providing the foun
dation from which Aetius would later deal with Attila
at the Battle of Chalons.
On Attila's return to the valley of the Danube, the tribes remained independent from political or military
control by a central throne. Attila began his rise to power by renewing and de
veloping relationships with tribal chieftains. Much of
this familiarization came through Attila's many hunt
ing expeditions throughout the Hunnish territories. He
gained the loyalty of these chieftains through emo
tional appeal, arousing their warrior instincts and
whetting their appetites for easily gained glory and
pillage.
How Attila became king over the tribe in the valley
of the Danube is said, by historical accounts, to be the
result of his brother Bleda's death during a hunt. A more romantic legend among the Huns gives his rise another origin. According to this legend, on the death of Bleda, tribal leaders, gathered in mourning, argued over who would
become their king. During this council a lad reported a flaming sword had just appeared in the midst of a nearby meadow. Following the lad to the meadow, the tribal chieftains watched in awe as the flaming sword



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
jumped into Attila's outstretched hand. The sword's craftsmanship was of such quality it was assumed to have been made by a deity. It was an omen, "the Sword of God." Surely it was sent to them to end this quarrel
and to confirm Attila as their king.
Once he became king over the royal tribe, Attila be
gan his unification of the other fiercely independent
tribes into a Hunnish nation.
He is said to have spent days in front of his tent in
conference with tribal chieftains to confirm their loy
alties to his unification plan. Attila summarily executed
rebellious chieftains. The fear of resistance to him be
came so manifest that one aging chieftain excused him
self from a personal audience with King Attila by saying,
"My eyes, too weak to behold the sun, could assuredly
not look upon the brilliance of the conqueror." This
artful flattery was accepted by Attila without objection. Although he leveraged its power, he was not seduced
by the trappings of his new office. Drinking and eating from implements made of wood, Attila sat on a wooden throne in a wooden palace. His dress showed none of
the elegance of the Roman rulers. Rather, he wore a
coat of black fur and a black leather cap pulled down
over his eyes. Attila was held in high regard by the horde. His entry into their camps was something to behold. Women, children and warriors lined his path shouting praises to him. Women presented food to him as he rode by
them. Attila accepted these gestures with dignity, hast
ily eating the food while still remaining on the back of
his gallant black charger, Villam. His rule as King of Huns was marked by swift yet considerate justice. He did not act in haste. He gave



INTRODUCTION: IN SEARCH OF ATTILA
the Huns a national goal—to bring under their control
the Germanic and Slavic nations, to conquer Rome and
Constantinople, to march against all of Asia, then on
to Africa. Thus, the Huns would reign over all the lands
to the north, south, east and west. Indeed, Attila would
rule the world.
Attila's plan was ambitious, fired by boyhood dreams, shaped by those images formed in his youth. He aimed to realize it step by step. His method was tempered by patience and unrelenting tenacity born of Asiatic vir
tues and by the political insight mastered by one who
listens and watches while he waits for the precise mo
ment to act.
The conquests of the Huns under his rule are leg
endary. Attila was skillful in the execution of his plan.
His army, by many estimates to have consisted of as many as 700,000 warriors, was a conglomeration of
barbarians. Yet it became single in purpose, well dis
ciplined and filled with esprit de corps. Even though the momentum of the Huns proceeded
with difficulty at times, victory was often theirs without
local resistance. Villages were, at times, abandoned
upon hearing of the Hunnish army's approach. Yet this forward movement of the Huns was to be abruptly
frustrated by Aetius, the lifelong rival of their ruler. In a.d. 451, on the Catalaunian Plains near Chalons, in the ruins of an ancient Roman camp, the Huns massed
their chariots in preparation for battle. The Romans
were led into the conflict that would ensue by Aetius. The Huns were under Attila's personal command. Using tactics gained from his experience among the Huns, Aetius neutralized the advantage of the Hunnish army's bows and cavalry by engaging them in hand



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
to-hand combat. The bronze helmets and body arma
ment of the Roman soldiers shielded them from the
stone axes of the barbarians, who were unskilled in
infantry tactics. The swords of the Romans prevailed
over the lariats and long lances of the Huns. The battle
was savage, neither side took prisoners, and few of the
wounded survived. It is believed that by nightfall, be
tween 162,000 and 300,000 Hunnish warriors lay dead on the Catalaunian Plains.
Realizing the futility of this battle's continuance, At
tila ordered a retreat, leaving the Romans somewhat
astonished to see the Hunnish horde's backside in At
tila's first, and only, defeat. Something in Attila's plan
had gone wrong and, for a moment in time, his confidence, unrelenting energy and will seemed to desert him. His optimistic desire to conquer the world dwindled before him in tormenting defeat.
Returning his battered army to the familiar valley of the Danube, Attila turned his energy toward military
science and the necessary changes to set out once again
in his conquest of the world. A reorganization of his
army sufficient to implement the radical change nec
essary to overcome the tactics of his adversary Aetius would not be without profound alterations in the customs held for generation upon generation by the Huns. Leather armor with borders of metal plates replaced
the fur garments of his army. The Huns' capital city,
Etzelburg, was fortified to withstand long sieges. Their nomadic life-style was laid aside; they were no longer
unstable and wandering—they had a homeland and had become deeply rooted in its soil, had even become
civilized. Catapults were prepared. Warriors were drilled
in infantry tactics—learning to maneuver on foot, their

protection no longer being the safety provided by ac
curacy with the bow but in the use of long shields. Circumstances brought about by developing allegiances between the Persians and the Romans pre
maturely halted Attila's plans to completely restructure the Hunnish army. Immediate action was necessary to
prevent the consequences of this alliance. Attila gath
ered his tribal chieftains and, in a few words, laid out
their route of march and order of battle. The return of the Huns to battle was not perceived
by many Romans as any great peril to their safety. They
had not been witness to the Hunnish army's ability to
savagely devastate what lay before them. They were
shortly to become more familiar with the fuiy of the
barbaric swarm.
After a swift and unobstructed entry into Italy, the
Huns laid siege to Aquileia, a bastion accustomed to
invasions. Soon the Aquileians saw the Huns not as
blundering savages but as a well-equipped and -disciplined army, skillful in the execution of military movements.
The siege was long, rations became scarce, and Hun
nish morale threatened to fade. But when the now
disciplined warriors attacked upon the sighting of a
good omen—that of a stork and its brood leaving the
city's towers—victory was instant! The walls crumbled,
and the city was set in flames.
The horde was allowed time to ransack, and then
they set off in a fresh fighting spirit, renewed by this
major triumph. Aquileian survivors told the empire of
Attila's vast army, now advancing ferociously, me
thodically, on Rome. The empire was exasperated! It now feared this seemingly unstoppable force.



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
As they could no longer rely on the genius of the
great General Aetius, who had long since fallen from
grace, the Roman leaders were at a loss. At first they thought of offering gold for ransom, but decided this
would not satisfy a horde that could just as easily add
all ofItaly's treasure to the booty that already overflowed
their chariots.
In desperation, the Emperor Valentinian thought of
another tactic. Why not offer Honoria, his sister, to Attila as a wife? Had this not even been promised in a treaty of long ago? This plan was put aside when it was suggested that since there had been no earlier demand by Attila for the hand of Honoria, perhaps the King of Huns was content with his more than 300 wives.
Lacking any suitable alternative, and without con
sulting Aetius, Valentinian sent Pope Leo I to negotiate with Attila. The emperor hoped that perhaps through
respect for the clergy, the Scourge of God would show mercy as he had one year earlier in Gaul when he acceded to Bishop Lupus' request and spared the city
of Troyes. What transpired between the frail pope and the King
of Huns remains a mystery. But, after their meeting, Attila turned his army northward, sparing Rome, and returned to his homeland, avoiding further battle.
Trouble was brewing for Attila in the valley of the Danube. His six favored sons were impatient at not having received their own kingdoms as promised ear
lier by their father. They were frustrated that he had returned without conquering lands for them. Perhaps it was his advancing age that tempered his
ambitions of world conquest. Possibly it was Attila's

diminishing self-confidence, or a personal calming of
his ambitions in the satisfaction in having willingly
spared Rome. World conquest was no longer an unfulfilled need. The warrior in him was now turning more toward diplomacy. He resumed negotiations with the Romans. These actions, unfamiliar during his rule,
made it necessary for disciplinary reasons that Attila reconfirm himself as King of Huns. Again, as in earlier
years, he executed chieftains who rebelled against him. The beautiful young daughter of one such rebel
chieftain implored Attila to spare her father, who was,
nevertheless, executed. Attila was, however, touched
by her beauty and decided to take the girl, Ildico, as his wife. The marriage was considered to be a good
omen by the Huns—Attila would forget his old age,
his disappointments and troubles and return to his pursuit of world conquest with new vigor. Thus, his sons would be given territories over which they could
rule.
After a convivial wedding ceremony, which is still
held in legendary awe, the royal couple retired to their
nuptial chamber. On the following day, in the midst of an uncustomary silence from their king, the unanswered door of the nuptial chamber was smashed open by his warriors. There lying naked on a white fur was
Attila, dead, his body motionless in a pool of blood! Some say his bride slew him to revenge the death of her father; however, no wounds were discovered. Some
say perhaps his sons, impatient with their father, killed him. The romantic and legendary version of Attila's
death is that he died from natural causes—hemorrhage brought on by the excessive festiveness of his wedding.

LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
Attila's burial was as colorful as his wedding had
been. In a great and majestic ceremony, he was buried beneath the Tisza River.
Western history, in which Attila is described as cruel
and inordinately ruthless, holds no reverence for him. That has laid the foundation for innuendoes and puns
regarding his character and mannerisms. Similar traits
manifested by notorious leaders in all subsequent gen
erations were considered cold-blooded and evil. He has been scorned by authors as prominent as Dante in The Divine Comedy, Inferno, Canto XII, in
which he wrote, "There Heaven's stern justice lays
chastising hand on Attila, who was the scourge of earth."
In his fictitious final confession to the North Kore
ans, the commander of the USS Pueblo, Lloyd Bucher,
appealed to his captors "to forgive our dastardly deeds unmatched since Attila." Later, Commander Bucher swore to the enemy that his account of the Pueblo's
actions was ". . . true on the sacred honor of the Great
Speckled Bird." Again, Attila bore the brunt of a timely
use of the pen. Yet, Attila is proudly remembered by many of his remnant people, the Hungarians. Perhaps the German Nibelungen-Lied said it best for them when he wrote, "There was a mighty king in the land of the Huns whose goodness and wisdom had no equal." Attila is an example of the type of leader who is never
satisfied—preferring to take the initiative, acting rather
than doing nothing. Attila was less savage than the Romans, who cast thousands of Christians to wild animals for mere entertainment. In comparison, he was less cruel than Ivan
the Terrible, Cortes or Pizarro. In his sparing of Rome,

INTRODUCTION: IN SEARCH OF ATTILA
he showed more mercy than did Genserich, Belizar, the Norsemen, the Germans and the Spanish mercen
aries, who all pillaged it without regard.
Attila's legacy is generally unfamiliar to us in the
Western World. We are naive about his historical importance as a genius civilizer, his open-mindedness
and richness of views, in all of which he far exceeded Alexander the Great or Caesar. The controversy surrounding Attila will perhaps never
be resolved, but his "leadership secrets" present in
sightful opportunity to learn, by way of metaphor, age
old characteristics, values and principles that separate
those who lead from those who follow.
After all, he became Attila, King of Huns!

In the Roman Court:
"Leadership Qualities"
Cleverly influencing other nations from Rome, the
empire used a child-hostage exchange arrange
ment to broaden control over countries it sought to
seduce into its servitude. Simply stated, the empire sent
one of its own to a foreign nation and those nations
reciprocated by sending one of their own sons to live
and learn in the Roman courts.
This cunning approach was a masterful exercise in subversive diplomacy. The honored countries were in
filtrated at their highest levels by the youthful spies for
the empire. Once in the foreign courts, the young Romans reported vital information back to the empire while gaining personal knowledge of the customs,
courtesies and traditions of their hosts. This two-edged
strategy also gave the empire the opportunity to tutor
the hostages sent to its court. Teaching them the lux

uries of life served to influence the politics and culture
of less-civilized and subservient nations when the ma
tured hostages returned to their native land. Apparently once the favored nephew of King Rugila, Attila diminished his standing with the Hunnish throne
by his constant harsh criticism of policies that placed
the horde in the service of the empire and other foreign nations. It became convenient for Rugila to use the
Roman practice to rid himself of his chief critic.
Not yet in his teens, Attila was sent to the Roman
court of Honorius. There, thought Rugila, the tutelage
of the empire would surely develop characteristics in Attila that would make him a more compatible member of the Huns' royal family.
Attila personally rejected the fancy robes, pompous
hairstyles, rich foods and perfumed quarters offered to
him as a hostage, though such trappings intrigued his
unsophisticated comrades. Attila attempted, but was
unable, to ignite their spirit to resist this and other
beguiling propaganda imposed by the empire. After
failing to escape, Attila resolved to use passive resis
tance and to adapt to his temporary circumstances. In the Roman court, he watched and listened. With each passing day he became more and more determined to rid the world of Roman and mysterious Chris
tian influences. Attila was an extraordinary student of the internal and foreign policies of the empire. He grew in his awareness of their armies, weapons, order of
battle and their lack of a strong navy. Attila used this
period to spy on visiting ministers, to seek out the
intrigues of the empire and to learn about policy making and diplomacy. Life in the Roman court was a tremendous hardship
15



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTELA THE HUN
for Attila. He was lonely for his people, for his family,
and yearned to free them from the service of a strange and foreign nation that the Huns, once united, could
surely defeat.
The boy who was sent as a hostage to the court of
Honorius profited from his Asiatic virtue of patience.
His attitude was one of stoicism and certitude. He
learned that pushing events to happen before their time
was less important than their ultimate achievement.
He, therefore, set out to develop the personal abilities
that would ensure his success at the time that he would
actively pursue his reign as King of Huns.
ATTILA ON:
"LEADERSHIP QUALITIES"
As we gather in this counsel, I, Attila, have prepared
my innermost thoughts regarding leadership qualities. These thoughts I give you so you and your subordinates might be better prepared to lead the Huns.
It is essential to the Hunnish nation that we have in
our service leaders at every level who possess the skills,
abilities and attitudes that will enable them to suc
cessfully carry out the responsibilities incumbent to
their office.
There is no quick way to develop leaders. Huns must
learn throughout their lives—never ceasing as students, never being above gaining new insights or study
ing innovative procedures or methods—whatever the
source.
Our leaders must learn early in their service certain
16



IN THE ROMAN COURT: "LEADERSHIP QUALITIES"
basic qualities and have opportunities to mature in them.
We must teach these qualities to our young warriors,
if they are to develop into able chieftains. Basic in
struction in horsemanship, with the lariat, bow and
lance, is sufficient for our warriors but not for those who lead them.
In order to skillfully lead our nation, we must have
chieftains who possess, among others, the following
essential qualities, which through experience become mastered skills:
LOYALTY—Above all things, a Hun must be loyal.
Disagreement is not necessarily disloyalty. A Hun
who, in the best interest of the tribe, disagrees, should
be listened to. On the other hand, a Hun who actively
participates in or encourages actions that are counter
to the good of the tribe is disloyal. These Huns,
whether warrior or chieftain, must be expeditiously removed. Their ability to influence and discourage
loyal Huns is a contagious disease. In cases where
disloyal actions and attitudes cannot be changed,
harsh action must be taken to rid ourselves of those
among us who see no value in and subvert our cause.
COURAGE—Chieftains who lead our Huns must have courage. They must be fearless and have the forti
tude to carry out assignments given them—the gal
lantry to accept the risks of leadership. They must not
balk at the sight of obstacles, nor must they become bewildered when in the presence of adversity. The role
of a chieftain has inherent periods of loneliness, des
17



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
pair, ridicule and rejection. Chieftains must be long
suffering in their duties—they must have the courage
to act with confidence and to excel in times of uncer
tainty or danger as well as in times of prosperity.
DESIRE—Few Huns will sustain themselves as
chieftains without strong personal desire—an in
herent commitment to influencing people, processes and outcomes. Weak is the chieftain who does not
want to be one. We must be careful to avoid placing
capable warriors into positions of leadership that
they have no desire to fulfill.
EMOTIONAL STAMINA—Each succeedingly higher level of leadership places increasing demands on the
emotions of chieftains. We must ensure that our
leaders at every level have the stamina to recover
rapidly from disappointment—to bounce back from
discouragement, to carry out the responsibilities of
their office without becoming distorted in their
views—without losing clear perspective, as well as
the emotional strength to persist in the face of seem
ingly difficult circumstances.
PHYSICAL STAMINA—Huns must have chieftains
who can endure the physical demands of their lead
ership duties. Chieftains must nurture their bodies
with the basic, healthful staples. Chieftains cannot
lead from their bedside. They lack energy when filled with too much food or drink. The distorting potions of the Romans only confuse minds. A body not properly used becomes abused. A healthy body supports a healthy mind. Our chieftains must be strong in body in order to lead the charge.
- 18



IN THE ROMAN COURT: "LEADERSHIP QUALITIES"
EMPATHY—Chieftains must develop empathy—an appreciation for and an understanding of the values
of others, a sensitivity for other cultures, beliefs and traditions. However, empathy must not be confused with sympathy, which may result in unwise conso
lation in times when, above all other things, the good of the tribe or nation must be pursued with adroit
diplomacy or battlefield action.
DECISIVENESS—Young chieftains must learn to be decisive, knowing when to act and when not to
act, taking into account all facts bearing on the sit
uation and then responsibly carrying out their lead
ership role. Vacillation and procrastination confuse
and discourage subordinates, peers and superiors
and serve the enemy well.
ANTICIPATION—Learning by observation and
through instincts sharpened by tested experience,
our chieftains must anticipate thoughts, actions and
consequences. Anticipation bears a level of risk that
is willingly accepted by a chieftain who will excel
when others turn to the comfort of personal security.
TIMING—Essential to all acts of leadership is the timing of recommendations and actions. There is no
magic formula for developing a sense of timing. One
often gains this leadership skill by applying the lessons learned through failure. Knowing whom you
are dealing with, their motives, characters, priorities and ambitions are critical elements even when seeking approval of the simplest recommendation.
COMPETITIVENESS—An essential quality of lead
ership is an intrinsic desire to win. It is not necessary
19



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
to win all the time; however, it is necessary to win the important contests. Chieftains must understand
that the competition inside and outside our nation
is strong and not to be taken lightly. A sense of com
petitive anger drives those who win on the battle
field, in negotiations and in situations of internal
strife. A leader without a sense of competitiveness
is weak and easily overcome by the slightest chal
lenge.
SELF-CONFIDENCE—Proper training and expe
rience develops in chieftains a personal feeling of assurance with which to meet the inherent chal
lenges of leadership. Those who portray a lack of
self-confidence in their abilities to carry out lead
ership assignments give signs to their subordinates,
peers and superiors that these duties are beyond their
capabilities. They become, therefore, weak leaders
and useless chieftains.
ACCOUNTABILITY—Learning to account for personal actions and those of subordinates is funda
mental to leadership. Chieftains must never heap
praise or lay blame on others for what they them
selves achieve or fail to accomplish, no matter how glorious or grave the consequences.
RESPONSIBILITY—Leaders are only necessary
when someone is to be responsible to see that actions
are carried out and directions followed. No king,
chieftain or subordinate leader should ever be al
lowed to serve who will not accept full responsibility
for his actions.
CREDIBILITY—Chieftains must be credible. Their
20



IN THE ROMAN COURT: "LEADERSHIP QUALITIES"
words and actions must be believable to both friend
and foe. They must be trusted to have the intelligence
and integrity to provide correct information. Lead
ers lacking in credibility will not gain proper influence
and are to be hastily removed from positions of re
sponsibility, for they cannot be trusted.
TENACITY—The quality of unyielding drive to accomplish assignments is a desirable and essential
quality of leadership. The weak persist only when
things go their way. The strong persist and pursue through discouragement, deception and even per
sonal abandonment. Pertinacity is often the key to
achieving difficult assignments or meeting challeng
ing goals.
DEPENDABILITY—If a chieftain cannot be de
pended upon in all situations to carry out his roles
and responsibilities, relieve him of them. A king can
not observe each and every action of his subordinate
chieftains; therefore, he must depend upon them to
get things done. Young chieftains should understand that Huns serving above and below them in the tribe
and nation are counting on their ability to lead, and they should be proud of being entrusted with such
responsibility.
STEWARDSHIP—Our leaders must have the essential quality of stewardship, a caretaker quality. They must serve in a manner that encourages con
fidence, trust and loyalty. Subordinates are not to be abused; they are to be guided, developed and rewarded for their performance. Punishment is to be reserved as a consequence of last resort and spar
- 21



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
ingly applied only when all other attempts have failed to encourage the rebellious to comply. Without a flock there can be no shepherd. Without an army there
can be no battle captains. Without subordinates there
can be no leaders. Leaders are, therefore, caretakers
of the interests and well-being of those and the purposes they serve.
Those of you who are overly ambitious may attempt
to acquire these qualities over a short period. As I,
Attila, have found in my own life, these qualities of
leadership simply take time, learning and experience
to develop. There are few who will find shortcuts. There
are simply rare opportunities to accelerate competence, and without paying the price, no matter how
great or small, none will become prepared to lead oth
ers.
Learn these leadership qualities well. Teach them to
the Huns. Only then will we expand our ability to lead our vast nation in pursuit of world conquest.
22



The Lust for
Leadership: "You've
Got to Want to Be
in Charge"
On the death of his father, Mundzuk, Attila came
under the guidance and care of his uncle Rugila.
Soon after his reign as king began, Rugila—enticed by
the immediacy of reward, deceived by sinister diplomacy, and having no awareness of the terror inspired
in other nations by his tribes—entered the horde into
the service of the empire.
Even in his youth, Attila believed in the noble past
and legends of his ancestry. They were a strong and
powerful people, not to be subjected to slave rule or indentured service. Though the Huns had roamed the vast regions of Europe and portions of Asia and Africa, their leaders,
Attila's noble progenitors, had never let their tribes
perform unnecessary service for strangers. Rather, they
had persisted in their search for a peaceful place in
23



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
which they would be free to pursue a pastoral exis
tence. Attila became an outspoken critic of King Rugila and
his policies, for Rugila's motives and decisions were
perceived by the young prince as contrary to the strengths, purposes and good of the Hunnish people.
Attila's criticism diminished his favor with Rugila, who
perceived the lad as a threat to the security of his noble
position and shipped the child off to the Roman court
early in his life. Attila began to develop a hatred for
ignoble rule and a lust to lead those who could help
him right the situation.
While a hostage, Attila attempted to unite other "bar
barians" in rejecting the intrigues of the empire. They
were not to fall victim and become servants of the empire! They must retain their own identities! Though
his efforts to unite them failed, his determination to
lead waxed with each passing day.
Attila turned his anger, distaste and contempt for the
empire into an energetic study to learn the ways of leadership and diplomacy. His mind was fueled by the
fires burning deep in his heart to unite the Huns and conquer the Romans. Instead of immediately attempting to gain control
on his return to his homeland, Attila was patient, his
every step planned. He knew his leadership knowledge and abilities to influence must mature no matter how
driven his desires to take charge. Attila traveled and
hunted, using the time to focus his ambition into a
plan that would succeed. When the moment came, Attila was ready! He took
charge! He was prepared in every way to face the chal
lenges and opposition he would encounter as king. He
24



LUST FOR LEADERSHIP: "YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO BE IN CHARGE"
would not be discouraged! He would not deviate from
his objective! He was ready to take risks, ready to cause
the Huns to excel through unity of action. His dogged
perseverance and lust to assume a position of consid
erable responsibility had held—his destiny had arrived! Attila had become King of Huns.
ATTILA ON: "YOU'VE GOT TO
WANT TO BE IN CHARGE"
There is little more unsettling to Huns than being under the command of a king or chieftain who shows a
lack of commitment in his responsibility as a leader.
Too often, the leadership of many nations falls to
princes who lack the ambition, courage and capabili
ties to reign as leaders. Such disinterest, cowardice and
incompetence is manifested in various actions that dis
courage and bewilder subordinates, thus strengthening the enemy.
It is the responsibility of all Huns to choose and
follow only those chieftains who demonstrate a desire
to lead. Such leaders will be of no composite character. They will be as different from one another as one Hun
is different from another. They will not be laden with
all human virtues, nor will they possess a flawless char
acter.
Committed leaders, those with a lust for leadership,
a willingness to serve, will, however, be distinguishable
by their wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, authority and courage. They will have a human quality and a strong commitment to their cause and to that of those they
serve.
25 •



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
Huns who aspire to become chieftains often do not have such motives from the time they leave the comfort of the chariot. Now perhaps you Huns would ask of
me, "How, Attila, might I know if I possess sufficient
desire to be a chieftain?" To those who wish my coun
sel, I offer these thoughts:
Above all other traits, one who desires to lead must
possess an intrinsic desire to achieve substantial per
sonal recognition and be willing to earn it in all
fairness.
You must have resilience to overcome personal mis
fortunes, discouragement, rejection and disappointment.
You must have the courage, creativity and stamina
to focus on accomplishing your responsibilities
through the directed, delegated efforts of subordi
nates.
You must recognize and accept that your greatness will be made possible through the extremes of your
personality—the very extremes that sometimes make
for campfire satire and legendary stories.
You must not let your desire to lead take the form
of overeagerness. This would cause failure for many. You must be willing to temper your lust to lead with
preparation, experience and opportunity.
You must remember that success in your office will depend largely upon your sustained willingness to
work hard. Sweat rules over inspiration!
26



LUST FOR LEADERSHIP: "YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO BE IN CHARGE"
You must be committed to persevere even in the face of opposition and challenge.
You must be determined to apply massive common sense in solving complex problems.
You must not be threatened by capable contempor
aries or subordinates. Rather, you must be wise in
selecting capable captains to achieve those things a
chieftain can attain only through strong subordi
nates.
You must be willing to make unrecognized and
thankless personal sacrifice for those you serve and
those you lead. This sacrifice may take the form of
absence from a tribal hunt, spending extraordinary energies and patience to develop subordinates and tending to the needs of these subordinates at times when your own needs go unfulfilled. You must be
willing to bypass a festival in your own camp if a
situation in another camp requires your presence
and attention.
You must have a passion to succeed—a passion that drives you to prepare yourself and your Huns to
excel.
You must be willing to learn, to listen and to grow in your awareness and abilities to perform the duties of your office. This is not often accomplished with
out tremendous effort and sacrifice of other inter
ests.
You must be willing to remain your natural self and
27



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
not take on an aura of false pride in your countenance.
You must be willing to accept the simple fact that you have flaws and will need to work every day to
become a better chieftain than you were yesterday.
I leave you with the admonition to never accept an
office of leadership for which you are not willing to
pay the tribute necessary to successfully fulfill its ob
ligations.
28



Becoming a Hun:
"Customs"
The Huns were a collection of fiercely independent
multiracial and multilingual tribes, a people with
out recognizable physical characteristics, with no ob
servable religion but talented in military and political
matters and marked by a common thread of mercurial instability and emotional heroism. Yet they were tem
pered by their nomadic qualities, which for centuries led them on constant migrations in search of a peace
ful, pastoral existence. The Huns had a certain magical magnetism that af
fected both friend and foe. They could assimilate for
eigners into their tribes as well as they could integrate themselves into foreign nations. They were a unique
people of a complex culture, the synthesis of all they'd encountered. Although the Huns were feared, thou
29



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
sands of foreigners joined them and even died for their cause. They possessed a certain commonality of na
tional character that often seemed to be of a contrast
ing nature.
Known for their respect for women, elders and ancestors, the Huns had a conservative moral philosophy. They rejected secular or religious doctrines and practices that made man subordinate to abstract concepts of a philosophical, political or so
cial nature. Their guilelessness and naive faith in human goodness frequently caused them to fall prey
to the intricacies of more skilled practitioners of diplomacy. Their songs were simple, endless tales of nos
talgic utterances filled with love for nature. In all
tribes, one could find a strong interest in romantic
history and also applied humor filled with political
satire.
Huns believed strongly in miracles, held beautiful but useless ideals and were a people of optimism and
flexibility. Their love of the hunt was well-established in
their tradition. It was, perhaps, the Huns who began
the custom of the "stag party."
In all, they were a nation with basic attitudes toward
life and mankind, yet their love of freedom, excessive pride and volatile tempers often caused them to reject
both military and political discipline.
The Huns were a constituency of vast differences
who, nevertheless, held common virtues, and it was perhaps their strong sense of honor and loyalty, paired
with Attila's intense personal appeal, that united them into a nation that for a short time was a powerful
military and diplomatic force.
30



BECOMING A HUN: "CUSTOMS"
ATTILA ON: "CUSTOMS"
All who are Huns and those who seek to become one of us must learn, adapt and adhere to our customs. If they are not Huns, then we must suspect them to be
Romans or to be allies of the empire; therefore, we
must treat them with caution.
It is not essential that a Hun compromise those char
acteristics that make him a unique warrior. Every Hun,
however, must be willing to conform to those things that
distinguish us as a nation of strong, unified tribes. We
must be single in purpose, yet individuality that does not
distract from the tribe or nation must be preserved. What is good for the Hun must be good for the tribe
and nation. Conversely, what is good for the tribe and
nation must be good for the Hun; otherwise, he will
desert to the Romans.
When we prescribe dress for battle, celebration, cer
emony or other occasions, Huns will see to it that they wear that which is customary. When we establish Hunnish methods, they must be taught to our young so they will know what is expected
of them in every situation. If Huns do not learn the rules,
their chieftains cannot expect them to be followed. Our songs and dances must be unique in the celebration of our noble heritage. We must not introduce into them contaminants that may cause our heritage to become confused.
Our approach toward exacting tribute and loyalties from those we have chosen as the opposition must
continue to use and increase the strength of the nation. Only when we fail to recognize our power and influence over the adversary have they set us back.
31



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
We must modify our customs when the situation
warrants, if such an alteration will strengthen our po
sition. We cannot, however, distill those customs that
remain key to the success of the Hunnish nation. We cannot permit strong chieftains or groups of young Huns
to attempt the founding of customs that serve only their
purpose. Customs are of nations, not of individuals.
Being a Hun requires dedication and devotion to the cause of our nation. Following our customs is a tribute
to our heritage—and to our present and future.
Huns are required to make oaths of lasting obligation
to the nation. We, in turn, as leaders, must ensure that
we have customs—strong traditions—worthy of such
a lasting conviction and must welcome into our tribes
and nation all who adhere to those principles and ways
we value now and forever.
To a nation of such robust and independent heritage,
I, Attila, give counsel as to those things we admonish
all to honor as our customs:
It is the custom of all Huns to hold strong to personal
and national honor. This is a cardinal virtue. One's
word must prevail over all other considerations, in
cluding political expediency.
We must value the capable Hun, whether of lowly or of noble birth. We must appoint our chieftains
from among those most qualified to lead, regardless
of ancestry.
We must not retaliate against the innocent, use unscrupulous tactics or kill unsuspecting or trapped enemies. We must be fierce in the eyes of all we seek
to influence, yet the use ofunnecessary terror is ignoble.
32



BECOMING A HUN: "CUSTOMS"
A nation of one ancestry and race is weak. We must hold strong our custom of welcoming all foreigners
who seek to join our cause, treating them with dignity and respect and teaching them our language and customs.
Our accepted differences and diversities must be pooled into a common purpose worthy of our efforts
as tribes and as a nation.
Our racial, cultural, moral and social concepts, in
herited from our ancestors of Asia and Europe, must be recognized and honored by all, through respect
for our fellow man, his faculties and well-being.
We must never build pyramids in our own honor.
While we hold strong the custom of individual and
national pride, we must not fall victim to pompous,
self-serving practices that weaken the fiber of our
vitality and appeal to those we serve.
We must hold fast to our custom of high ideals and
optimism—never being discouraged by those who
would seek to gain personal or national advantage
over us.
Our songs, dances, games, jests and celebrations must
always remain steadfast as propitious opportunity
to renew our allegiance and identity as Huns.
You chieftains have the responsibility to continue to
teach and practice the customs that make our diverse people and tribes a strong and powerful Hunnish na
tion, lest they falter for lack of an identity.
33



Peace in the Camp.
"Morale and
Diseipline"
The camps of the Huns enjoyed a spirited life with
pronounced fluctuations injoy and sorrow. Victory brought about joy, sounds of celebration and ephem
eral feelings of security. The death of warriors, periods
of diminished supplies and tribal struggles brought on sorrow and despair. Hunnish morale and discipline was either very high or very low. Seldom, if ever, was theirs a life of status quo. Ambitious Huns could undermine the rule of weak chieftains and throw the camp into confusion. The ab
sence of a national cause contributed to the mixed
patterns of morale and discipline. The Huns' ways were more attuned to an uncertain
life, to a morale that was fired by battle, booty or caravaning to a new home. They were in fact disciplined only by the bounds of nature and the whims of fortune
34



PEACE IN THE CAMP: "MORALE AND DISCIPLINE"
and charged with the morale of a people holding te
naciously to optimistic determination.
Attila's task as King of Huns was to instill a new
sense of morale and discipline that would provide unity
in and among the barbaric tribes. Their greater destiny
was served only by setting aside past individual cus
toms as smaller, independent, undisciplined bands of nomads. Peace in the camps would only result from a new spirit of nationalism. Attila's was not a simple
chore!
ATTILA ON:
"MORALE AND DISCIPLINE"
The traditions of our nomadic life have given little con
cern to our morale and discipline as a nation. We have had passing moments of unity among our tribes, but this unity has been set aside when tribal
loyalties have been purchased by foreign nations.
Our people need the constancy of knowing what it means to be a Hun. Their spirit as Huns has been
betrayed each time they've been subjected to an alli
ance with a nation we could surely conquer. Morale and discipline as Huns is utmost if we are to
pass the tests imposed upon us as a unified nation. I have called you together at this time to teach you the ways of morale and discipline. Through them we may have peace in our camps.
Listen and learn from my counsel.
Morale and discipline are central to unity.
The conclusive test of the morale of your Huns is
35



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
the disciplined manner in which they bear the bur
dens of trial.
Discipline is not suppression. It is the teaching of
correct ways expected of Huns.
Without discipline, Huns cannot behave with com
mon action.
Morale is the spirit by which Huns submit their ser
vices to the tribe. It is not uncontrolled celebration and romping around the campfire.
Discipline is not always welcomed by Huns.
Chieftains must work hard to establish discipline
and morale, then to maintain them within the tribe.
Discipline does not mean a loss of individuality.
Discipline never allows deviation from order or from principles we hold important among our tribes or
nation.
Morale results from pride in being a Hun. Discipline
brings about morale.
Chieftains never condone a lack of either morale or
discipline. They plan for morale and discipline! They cause it to happen!
Discipline builds the inner confidence of our Huns.
Thus, discipline builds morale.
Huns seek discipline in their lives. They more will
ingly follow chieftains who are themselves disci
plined.
- 36



PEACE IN THE CAMP: "MORALE AND DISCIPLINE"
Lack of morale and discipline is the most contagious
and destructive disease that can ever enter your camp.
Morale and discipline is largely what chieftains make
of it.
Wise chieftains cause Huns to be tested in their dis
cipline through a successive scheme of opportunities in which their physical and emotional stamina is tried. However, chieftains should never test Huns
beyond reasonable capacity.
Discipline should be expected only at those levels of order and conformity that serve the good of the tribe or nation. Demanding more than is required is an
abuse of power and will give rise to rebellion within
the tribe.
Wise chieftains realize that unduly harsh or unnec
essarily lax discipline will undo the morale of their Huns.
Peace and harmony in your camps will come from
reasonable expectation of disciplined action and pur
pose. Morale will accompany such reasonable exacting
of discipline. There is no simple pattern by which morale
and discipline can be attained. These critical secrets to
your success as leaders are rather an awareness—an
attitude—by which you carry out the charge of your
office.
The morale and discipline attained in your camps

on the battlefield or in diplomatic encounters.
Now, having the benefit of my counsel, go forth to your camps and instill, even demand, new purpose of

and spirit of your Huns will instill in all our camps confidence, comfort and peace, without which we will continue to have widespread discontent and will return to a life of aimless wandering.

The Fury ofInternal
Battles: "Cunning
in the Tribes"
The Huns, long divided into independent tribes,
obeyed the precepts of nomadic life. They were
still not a nation but small tribes bound together solely
by their customs.
As a political matter, the king who reigned on the
banks of the Danube held no authority over the Huns
of Asia or Russia. Chieftains ruled their subject tribes
as they wished, pillaged on their own accord and mi
grated whenever resources had become exhausted. Never did they trouble to plan what their next destination might be. Intermarriages with conquered races were numer
ous. Without the powerful forces of unification, the Huns would have slowly been consumed into the medley of European races. Attila, son of Mundzuk and a descendant of the an
39



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
cient imperial family extending back thirty-two gen
erations to Cham, faced little opposition so long as he
did not seek to force his authority over the chieftains
not directly subject to him. Thus it happened that the Huns were often under
orders of different nations. Their chieftains often sold
themselves and their warriors as dearly as possible,
showing no reluctance to fight against even men of
their own race.
No national sentiment could exist in a people so bro
ken up, no concerted action was possible when every
one played his own hand. Uprooted, driven hither and
thither by caprice or need, the Huns wasted their
strength in battles from which they gained no profit. Attila comprehended that, once knit together and
strengthened by such nations as were associated with them, the Huns could easily become a mighty power. At a time when the Huns had nothing to fear either from Rome or Constantinople, he devoted himself to
the task of forging the instrument necessary for the
conquest of the world—a Hunnish army destined to
become invincible.
But first the army had to be assembled and the in
dependent tribes consolidated, and in these labors there would be no lack of obstacles. The first presented them
selves in his own family.
ATTILA ON:
"CUNNING IN THE TRIBES
The Hunnish nation is comprised not only of those who have long ridden on our many journeys but of all
- 40



THE FURY OF INTERNAL BATTLES: "CUNNING IN THE TRIBES"
who seek to join us in our romantic ventures as well.
To obtain our full potential as rulers of the world, we must openly welcome into our tribes all who seek the nature and fulfillment that comes with being a Hun. The worth of a Hun is not determined by tenure. A
Hun's value rests solely upon his demonstrated desire
to support, under all circumstances, those goals we
seek as a nation of unified tribes. Among our tribes we have suffered ills brought on by chieftains and Huns who prefer their own ambitions
to those of the nation. These are clearly those who,
openly or secretly, pledge their support even to the
enemy solely for personal gain. There are those among
our own tribes who indulge in pointless bickering and
other forms of rebellion against leaders. Their interests
are served at the cost of loyalty to the tribe or nation. Now, if we are to become and remain the powerful
nation that it lies within our potential to be, we must make radical changes in our ways of independence as
tribes, as chieftains or as Huns who fail to make a
contribution toward the unification that I, Attila, am
bound by destiny to achieve.
Let it be known that I will no longer tolerate cunning of any nature among our Huns, chieftains or tribes
that undermines the unification of our nation at any
level or on any issue.
He who attempts such cunning and becomes known to me, or to any chieftain exercising authority over him,
will hastily conform to our values or will be subjected to the most extreme reprimand. While the coals of our campfires would long become dust before I could pronounce guidance and caution for all the evils a cunning Hun would bring upon us,
41



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
I shall provide you with counsel that is sufficient for your learning and understanding at this time.
Beware of the treacherous Hun who pledges loyalty
in public then spreads discontent in private. Make
every effort to identify and remove these ignoble
characters, be they chieftains or your best warriors.
Be wise and anticipate the Brutus of your camp.
Unfailing and ill-deserved loyalty to Brutus was fa
tally paid for by Caesar.
Never expect your Huns to always be compatible.
But expect their differences to be resolvable without
the spread of discontent to other Huns.
Never allow your Huns too many idle moments. These
give rise to the beginnings of discontent.
Never cast blame for failure upon the guiltless.
Never allow your Huns to gain fame for the accom
plished deeds of others.
Never threaten the security or esteem of another
Hun unless you are prepared to deal with the con
sequences.
Be approachable; listen to both good and bad news from your Huns. Otherwise, you will provide reason for murmurings.
Be principled, not inflexible.
Be compatible to the policies of our nation and your
tribe. Otherwise, you will seek devious ways to accomplish your own ambitions. Thus, you will ulti

THE FURY OF INTERNAL BATTLES: "CUNNING IN THE TRIBES"
mately lose, no matter how bold or tenacious your
efforts.
Reward Huns of character and integrity—they are
rare.
The spirit of unity must be a cardinal principle in
the ways and attitudes of all Huns. Once divided, we
are easily made subject to foreign nations.
In imparting this secret to success as leaders of Huns,
I, Attila, charge you to be forthright in your demon
stration of unity and to hold in contempt any who
spread discontent among our tribes.
The unification of our tribes into a strong and for
midable nation can only be realized through loyalty to our cause and to those who reign with responsibility
over the destiny of our mighty horde.
43



The Tribute:
"Toying andReceiving
Deference"
Attila was well-schooled in the power of rumor.
He knew that advantageous rumor in the hearts and minds of ten could result in thousands becoming
his victims. Thus, through rumor, many obstacles to his "great conquest" could be removed. He considered himself to be above the reproach of
the masses; therefore, his reputation was important to him and him alone. He knew who he was, what he could achieve; his reputation was not as important to
his feelings of self-worth as it was to influencing the
outcome of battles and negotiations. Thus, Attila turned a nickname that in certain circles might have been considered unflattering into an advantage and, in doing so, gained riches for his treasury and tribute from untold thousands.
As the story goes, a Gallic monk, provoked either by
- 44



THE TRIBUTE: "PAYING AND RECEIVING DEFERENCE"
the horror of Attila's ambition or by a taste for martyrdom, created a new title for him. The monk hailed Attila not as "King of Huns" but as "the Scourge of God." Attila, sensing the power this newly acquired title
would yield on the battlefield and in negotiations, was quick to adopt it, for he knew the sobriquet would have
the influence of an army of 100,000.
Attila pressed the advantage of his reputation as "the Scourge of God," counting on the fear inspired by rumor to guarantee the success of a well-planned tactic
to obtain needed moneys. In the year a.d. 446, Attila,
preparing to launch his march on the empire, needed
money to gain the supplies and materiel essential for
the expansion of his army. So he invaded Thessaly. His goal was to ransom money from Theodosius II.
Selecting the most vicious and ferocious-looking warriors from his army, Attila ordered them to wear
garb of rough fur and leather, to eat only raw meat
and to inflict the most horrible tortures on their pris
oners. All of this planned fury was for the sake of per
petuating a legend. Resolved to fight the Huns that he mistakenly believed he had conquered five years earlier when the
horde halted within reach of the capital and were on the verge of ravaging the empire, and with the audacity and determination of a weakling annoyed at the disruption of his pleasure, Theodosius allowed the utter
destruction of more than seventy villages before he sought to make a truce at Thermopylae. Because of Theodosius' earlier resistance and now his meek submission of the Eastern Roman Empire, Attila raised the price of peace. Roman prisoners were
45



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
to be freed at a new cost of twelve pieces of gold instead
of the usual eight. Attila could have demanded much more. However, he knew the Romans would simply slap their subjects with new taxes to recoup the moneys. Attila had no
wish to burden the peasants, merchants, artisans, ple
beians or subjects of the empire, he simply sought to conquer its corrupt leaders.
ATTILA ON: "PAYING
AND RECEIVING DEFERENCE"
It is noble to accord the proper courtesy and recog
nition of stature to one in an office over you. And it is
wise to pay deference to your peers and subordinates
as well.
If a chieftain does not command the respect of his
Huns and that of his foes, he is weak and held to be
undeserving of his title.
Respect may be born of fear, real or perceived, as in
my notoriety as "the Scourge of God." When deference is born of fear, however, it results in an unwillingness
to serve and becomes manifested as passive resistance
to authority and purpose. It further leads to subversion, to sabotage and to generally low morale among those you are attempting to lead.
Real deference results in unyielding loyalty—a tribe
full of spirit and willing to follow their chieftain into
the mouth of hell, if necessary, for the cause of the
nation.
A chieftain's office is accepted by all as a position of
- 46



THE TRIBUTE: "PAYING AND RECEIVING DEFERENCE"
greater privileges because of increased responsibilities. Who of you would aspire to such an office if it brought no greater merit or privilege than that of an ordinary
Hun?
Our system of deference prescribes recognized advantages as reward for effort, enterprise and accom
plishment. The Hunnish people will acknowledge the
privilege attending our various offices of leadership
only so long as the demanded deference is reasonable and poses no harm to them. They are willing to grant such deference to those brave enough to lead the way. For they themselves see such respect as a cheap price
to pay someone else to take on the responsibilities of
leadership.
I must caution you, however, there are subtle aspects
of paying and receiving deference that will make the
deciding difference in one who leads by notoriety and one who leads with nobility. My words of counsel are:
Always accept the responsibility and privilege of your
office seriously. Never should you exercise your au
thority to the disadvantage of your subordinates. Never should you exact more privilege from your
office than your subordinates are willing to grant.
You are your reputation! If people speak evil of you, erroneously attribute misdeeds to you and will not
serve a greater purpose, you must do away with those adversaries or you must behave in a manner that will encourage them to amend their judgments. It isn't easy being the Scourge of God, but it has its advantages in dealing with the enemy. Among my
47



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
own people, however, I seek no such reputation. For
if they perceived me as having such a wicked intent,
I would not long serve as their king.
The king may use his fury and power to gain tribute from the enemy; however, a chieftain has no such
privilege. Although, as king, I must rely on my chief
tains to wisely use their power to influence the actions
of their Huns, I, Attila, will hastily remove any chief
tain who supposes similar influence over me.
Never should a chieftain fret over privilege. The re
sponsibilities of office should always prevail. Def
erence comes to the chieftain who does not seek it
for the sake of privilege alone.
The deference that attends any office of leadership is confirmed by custom, yet it is modified by circum
stance. What stands as privilege in the court or palace seldom has utmost importance on the battlefield
or in foreign territory. Be aware of where you are
and whom you are with when exercising the privi
leges of your leadership position.
Any promotion will require an adjustment on your
part as well as on the part of those who remember you in your former role. Have patience with yourself
and others. Dignity of person and title is a note
worthy attribute in this situation.
Always pay proper courtesy to your subordinate
leaders. Should you fail to accord them respect, so
will their subordinates.
Paying deference to your adversaries is essential. Once
you fail to recognize their abilities, influence and po
- 48



THE TRIBUTE: "PAYING AND RECEIVING DEFERENCE"
tential, they may gain advantage over you. Even as
I was underestimated by Theodosius, it was I, Attila, who exacted tribute from his kingdom.
With this counsel, I share with you chieftains the
duty of seeing to it that every position of leadership is
paid deference appropriate to its incumbent respon
sibilities and that this deference is acceptable to those
Huns whom we serve and respected by our adversaries,
the Romans. Nevertheless, lest we become trapped in our own importance, do not underestimate the power
of the empire to influence the course of the Hunnish
nation.
49



Battle Dress and
Armament:
"ChieftainsAre asThey
Appear to Their Huns"
Attila's presence was felt wherever he rode or rested. He was not only a Hun, he was the most distinguished Hun of all. Scorning the pompous garb of noble Romans, Attila
attired himself in the simple, crude skins of animals, which was the custom of his people. Even his crown, as king, was one of a simple leather helmet adorned
by only a single feather. It was headgear similar to that
of his warriors. He rode upon the mighty and gallant black charger
Villam ("Lightning"). So majestic an animal was Vil
lain, it is said that grass never grew again on the path he
trod. Villam was stronger and swifter than the mount of
any other Hun. This was a necessity, for Attila had to ride
first into battle, at the front of the horde. He was, after all,
their leader. Villam served Attila bravely and displayed
50



BATTLE DRESS AND ARMAMENT
a certain magnificence that appealed to the Huns. In battle, Attila was armed with the customary bow, lance and lariat of the Huns. His sword was another
matter. According to legend, during the dispute over who would succeed Bleda as king, a flaming sword appeared, firmly lodged in the ground in the midst of a meadow.
Attila and others went to look upon this magical sword.
As Attila held out his hand to grasp it, the sword "jumped"
into his palm. The brilliance of the sword and its craftmanship far excelled that of any weapon made by a common man. Certainly it must be an omen: The Sword of God was sent to confirm Attila as King of Huns. Legend has it that he carried this mighty sword into
all subsequent battles.
The Huns identified with Attila; his appearance was
not markedly different from theirs. Yet, Villain and the
Sword of God were sufficient to distinguish him as one
destined to lead, to be followed and to be respected for
his noble role, which was one of distinction and proper
appreciation for the privileges of office.
ATTILA ON:
"CHIEFTAINS ARE AS
THEY APPEAR TO THEIR HUNS"
Life in the Roman court and my understanding of the
durable nature of Huns has served me well in learning
how essential it is that a chieftain or king appear as is
expected and acceptable to those he serves and those he chooses to impress. Roman leaders adorn themselves in a manner that
- 51



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTDLA THE HUN
is pompous, one that is unnatural to their constituency
and repulsive to their allies. They, by their very ap
pearance, ignite the spirit of their enemy to destroy
such trappings of unwarranted superiority.
It is the custom of all followers to expect their leaders
to be marked at times with armament that distin
guishes them from the masses in the court or on the
battlefield.
It is wise, however, that such distinction not be of
fensive to warriors and not provide the fuel to ignite
the destructive spirit of the opposition in negotiations
or on the field of battle.
Therefore, as we chat around this campfire, lighted
for your learning and understanding, I will share my observations with you concerning the appearance of
chieftains.
A chieftain neither dresses nor arms himself at the expense of his Huns. His dress and weaponry may
be of subtle distinction as is accepted by custom. Yet
it must never be offensive in its cost or in its style,
nor should its intent be to project ignoble superiority
over those he leads, lest they scorn him for it.
A chieftain should choose a well-made sword, not one glittering with jewels and gold but one honed to
a sharp edge and made of the finest material in the
land. A sword is the mark of a chieftain. His sword,
like the chieftain himself, must prevail in battle. A
chieftain should dress in fine skins and furs—not those draped by gold and silver adornments. Pompous appearance breeds hate and gives rise to contempt and laughter among the ranks.
52



BATTLE DRESS AND ARMAMENT
If it is necessary to appear as ferocious savages in
order to project courage and victorious purpose, then do it well. Huns and chieftains should wear the most
barbaric of all furs, robes and other apparel. Such
appearance further serves to destroy the will of the enemy.
If it is appropriate to dress as peaceful, pastoral peo
ples for the purpose of reign in your camp or in
negotiations with strangers, lay aside your barbaric
attire and clothe yourself in furs and robes fitting
the occasion.
When on the hunt, be prepared to hunt. Take your
best bow and lance. Wear the clothing that will serve
you well as you chase the wild beasts in the forest.
On the occasion of celebration, it is customary for
a chieftain to wear his finest furs and well-tanned
skins. Again, an ignoble, superior attitude will only
evoke disdain from the gathered and distract from
the celebration.
A chieftain who appears to be noble will be treated as such by both Hun and foe.
One who appears as a jester of the courts will receive
deference as the same.
These observations have served me well as your king. Insignificant as they may seem, dress and armament
are important to a chieftain and will be counted in the
measure of your success or failure.
53



Aetius: "Picking
Tour Enemies Wisely
Aetius' father, a battlefield captain of high regard
known as Master of the Horse and the Count of Africa, was murdered by his own soldiers during a
revolt in Gaul. A German from Pannonia, his father wed a daughter of a wealthy royal Roman family. Thus, Aetius was both a son of a master warrior and of Ro
man nobility.
Sent to a foreign court as a child hostage, Aetius was received with honor by the Hunnish court of King Rug
ila in exchange for Attila.
In the court of Rugila, Aetius learned the ways of the
Huns, their traditions, and gained insight into their
collective personality. This learning would serve him
and the empire well in future dealings with the Huns

particularly with Attila.
His relationship with King Rugila grew into a strong
54



AETIUS: "PICKING YOUR ENEMIES WISELY"
bond. Later, he would convince Rugila to unite the armies of the Huns and ally them with John the Usurper, a Vandal by race, who had risen to become Master
of Soldiers—a man Aetius thought capable of reuniting
Rome and Constantinople.
Aetius cared little for the interests of a particular dynasty; an emperor meant much less than a cause. On his return to Rome, Aetius wed the daughter of
the patrician Carpilio. Always remaining on the best of terms with Rugila, Aetius became "Count of Do
mestics" and "Mayor of the Palace of Rome."
A man of unwavering principle, Aetius was physi
cally strong, an expert in the art of war—a formidable
warrior in every aspect. He mastered the intellect of
both Hun and Roman and learned well the strengths
and vulnerabilities of both nations.
Aetius knew the hardships of life and was subjected
to great personal and professional challenges through
out the course of his life. On more than one occasion,
he was the target of hired cutthroats and escaped seem
ingly by a miracle.
The corruption of the empire affected Aetius to the
point that he contemplated, more than once, changing
his allegiance to the Huns. It was, however, his strong
sense of duty and his oath to serve that harnessed his
anxieties. Thus, he always remained true to the empire. It was Aetius who later commanded the Roman forces on the Catalaunian Plains. There he combined his mas
tery of the art of war with his knowledge of the battle
order and tactics of the Huns to inflict the first and only
defeat ever suffered by Attila's army.
In time, the corruption of the Roman leaders overcame Aetius. His advice was not sought when Attila
- 55



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
began his final campaign against Italy. The price of
neglecting Aetius' counsel was the defeat of the empire
in many battles.
Although he remained loyal to the end, Aetius, in his
old age, was reluctant to lead the Roman army against Attila, whom he supported in his thoughts as a worthy
opponent and a man in pursuit of a great destiny.
In the end, Aetius was the victim of an assassination
ordered by the emperor he had so loyally served, Valentinian. The ignominious death of Aetius marked the
end of a great general and the only man in the empire
whom Attila held in high regard.
ATTILA ON:
"PICKING YOUR ENEMIES WISELY"
Now, you chieftains and Huns, I, Attila, have need to counsel you on how to choose your enemies.
Most conflicts in our lives lie within the Hunnish na
tion, between our tribes, our chieftains or among the people. Seldom is our real enemy a Roman. Only in
frequently will an enemy from outside have the stature
and skill of an Aetius that will enable him to defeat us on the battlefield or in diplomacy, for we are Huns. Being somewhat wise in the ways of Huns, yet naive
in the things that cause conflict, most of you are totally unaware when you make enemies. If you would set aside your tendencies to be unwill
ing to yield to another when appropriate, to let your
feelings of inadequacy and insecurity prevail in situ
ations warranting reason, to let your vanity become
expedient over appreciating others' worthy displays of
56



AETIUS: "PICKING YOUR ENEMIES WISELY"
competence, and if you would hesitate before inap
propriately influencing others, we would have more peace in our camps and have our energies in harmony when we face the Romans and the formidable Aetius, whom I have chosen as my enemy. In dealing with other Huns and particularly with the Romans, we must be cunning insofar as we should make enemies only with purpose. As I reflect on my
observations and experience, it has served me well to be aware of a few dangers in making enemies without
intent.
These pitfalls are perils to your effectiveness as chief
tains and warriors. Learn these, my secrets, well.
Do not expect everyone to agree with you—even if
you are king.
Do not waste stamina trying to negotiate with im
placable, uncooperative enemies—conquer them by more effective means.
Do not consider all opponents to be enemies. You
may have productive, friendly confrontations, with
others inside and outside your tribe.
Do not try to conform everyone's behavior unless
doing so is critical to tribal discipline or purpose.
Do not delegate an assignment and then attempt to
manage it yourself—you will make an enemy of the
overruled subordinate.
Do not lose your temper without advantageous rea
son.
Do not underestimate the power of an enemy, no
57



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
matter how great or small, to rise against you on another day.
Do not let your chosen enemy have the advantage
in any situation.
Do not neglect the opportunity to deceive your en
emy. Make him think of you as a friend. Let him
think of you as weak. Let him act prematurely. And
never tell him anything.
Do not make enemies who are not worthy of your every effort to render them into a state of complete
ineffectiveness.
Do not fail to use an enemy's weakness to your ad
vantage. On the other hand, when it becomes ap
parent that an enemy is too formidable, retreat and return another day when you can conquer him.
Do not insult unless you mean it.
It should be sufficient for all Huns to recognize that
when they exercise unbridled antagonism, create use
less jealousy and hatred of their very being, their ac
tions may serve to persuade even friends to become
foes. A chieftain will not be followed long by Huns who
despise him. A Roman of formidable power, unwisely made an active enemy, can rise to victory in diplomacy and on
the battlefield, for he becomes willing to win at any
cost, and our nation will suffer agonizing defeat, even
as I, Attila, did at the Battle of Chalons.
58



Leading the Charge:
ccResponsibilities of
a Chieftain"
The Hunnish horde adapted a new spirit of unity dur
ing the reign of Attila, for he had applied seemingly
simple principles to unite the tribes into a strong nation.
Setting aside the granting of high honors for individual achievement in favor of bestowing more noble
rewards upon those loyal to the new, national objec
tive, Attila laid the groundwork for the success of the
budding culture.
No longer would chieftains have the option to pledge their loyalty to other than the Hunnish nation. Should they choose to do so, Attila would remove them from
their office.
No longer would the Huns be tribes of nomads rambling through the countryside in search of booty. They
had a new direction! They would rule the world. Now, under Attila, the barbarians so dreaded by the
- 59



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
empire and even nations of afar* had a strategy for
their wanderings.
When possible, Attila exploited his influence through
diplomatic relations, skills he absorbed as a boy in the
Roman court. But if he failed to gain his objectives by
peaceful means, Attila would unleash the fury of his
horde, then attempt new negotiations to bring villages
and nations under his control.
Attila, with his magnetic force, influence and, perhaps, charm, through which he united the Huns was so awe-inspiring to his warriors and chieftains that he
was worshipped by them—even as a god by some. His power became so prevalent a force during his
reign that chieftains, not wishing to offend him and
face his fury, would simply yield to him without the
slightest resistance.
By way of fulfilling the obligation of his title, Attila
exhibited patience—not haste—and never showed a lack of prudent judgment; his plan had been formu
lated over years. It was a calculated scheme of se
quenced events that resulted in Attila's short-lived but
complete leadership over a nation of barbarians whom,
for a time, the world held in fear.
ATTILA ON: "RESPONSIBILITIES
OF A CHIEFTAIN"
It has been my observation over the years that nations,
tribes and lesser bands rise and fall on the strength of
*Loosely interpreted from history and legend, it may be surmised that the
Great Wall of China was built to bar Mongolian hordes—perhaps even
Attila's—from the vast mainland.
60



LEADING THE CHARGE: "RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CHIEFTAIN"
their leaders and on the ability with which their leaders
carry out their responsibilities of office—seeking first
the good of the people.
The corruption of the empire is largely a result of
the glamorous yet empty life its leaders seek to lead.
They have lost their sense of national purpose and em
ploy foreign armies to carry out the responsibilities incumbent to the Roman Legion.
They seek to gain office and stature by political ma
neuverings, casting aside personal standards of excel
lence in achievement and high expectations for unity.
Their leadership is, therefore, based on weakened
foundations and shallow loyalties.
While we are a young nation as a unity of tribes, we
have strong traditions that tie us mystically together. We
must use this delicate alliance as a basis for powerful,
lasting bonds that better serve our collective destiny.
Our leaders—you chieftains and valued warriors,
gathered here this night—must learn the responsibil
ities of office.
As many of you are unschooled in what I, Attila,
consider to be the responsibilities of leadership, I now
grant you my counsel on this subject.
Chieftains and leaders in every subordinate office
are responsible for establishing the atmosphere in which they lead. This atmosphere may have periods of change even as the seasons change. Nonetheless, unlike our lack of influence over the weather, our leaders can and must influence and control the spirit
of our tribes.
Leaders are bound by the traditions of office to es
61



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
tablish and follow the order under which their Huns
are judged, rewarded, punished and constrained. Without such order, known to all Huns, the people
will live in chaos.
By their own actions, not their words, do leaders
establish the morale, integrity and sense of justice of their subordinate commanders. They cannot say
one thing and do another.
Leaders must establish a high spirit of mutual trust
among subordinates and with their peers and su
periors.
Leaders must attach value to high standards of performance and have no tolerance for the uncom
mitted.
Leaders must expect continual improvement in their subordinates based on new knowledge and
experiences.
Leaders must encourage creativity, freedom of ac
tion and innovation among their subordinates, so
long as these efforts are consistent with the goals of
the tribe or nation.
Leaders must provide direction to their Huns, never
letting them wander aimlessly.
Chieftains realize greater recognition and booty than
their Huns. I, Attila, expect, therefore, more from
them than from their people.
Chieftains and subordinate leaders must learn the
responsibilities of their office. Without such knowl
edge, how can they fulfill their duties?
- 62



LEADING THE CHARGE: "RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CHIEFTAIN"
Chieftains must teach their Huns well that which is
expected of them. Otherwise, Huns will probably do something not expected of them.
Chieftains must inspect their Huns frequently in order to see that what is accomplished meets with what
is expected.
Chieftains should never misuse power. Such action
causes great friction and leads to rebellion in the
tribe or nation.
Chieftains make great personal sacrifice for the good
of their Huns.
Chieftains must not favor themselves over their Huns
when supplies are short.
Chieftains must encourage healthy competition
among their people, but must contain it when such
becomes a detriment to tribal or national goals.
Chieftains must understand that the spirit of the law
is greater than its letter.
Chieftains must never shed the cloak of honor, mo
rality and dignity.
Chieftains must never form selfish relationships and,
therefore, take advantage of their subordinates, peers
or superiors.
Chieftains must hold a profound conviction of duty above all other ambitions.
Now, I could continue with my counsel regarding
the responsibilities of leadership. It would be, however,
difficult to remember more than this at one time.
- 63



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
The things I have told you this night are the secrets
to leadership success at any level of office. They may seem to you to be common knowledge. Alas, they may
be, but they are not so common in practice.
You must leave this campfire counsel with one thought
and one thought only. That is, success is the result of hard work that overcomes all forms of disappointment and moments of discouragement. Success is not
achieved through complex strategies. It is achieved only
through conscientiously carrying out the duties of your
office and exercising the responsibilities of leadership

nothing else will prevail.
Now, go to your Huns and arise tomorrow with a new determination to follow your leaders, to support
your peers and to lead your subordinates, otherwise
we are destined to be slaves of the empire.

The Omen ofAquileia:
"The Essentials of
Decisiveness"
Aquileia was an imposing sight. Resting high on
a hillside, surrounded by a water obstacle, its
walls high and thick, its city gates reinforced, it was a
bastion of Italy. Aquileia was familiar with invasions.
Over the years, it had held against the Germans and
various Asiatic tribes.
Inside, it was fortified by a well-trained garrison. Its
food reserves and magazines were sufficient to with
stand long sieges. Its people were resolved not to surrender their vast treasures, acquired by trade and an
abundant agriculture, to any invaders—no matter how imposing. The Aquileians were inexperienced with the Huns. The terror with which they regarded the horde was largely the result of the tales of the Huns' devastating
attacks on other villages and lands. Attila's army was
65



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
great in number. It consumed the countryside as though
it were a swarm of locusts.
Coming off, as they were, two previous swift victories
against other fortified cities, the Huns became impa
tient with their siege of Aquileia. Food for man and
beast became scarce. The horde was restless—ready to
march on to greater Italy. The conquest of Aquileia,
however, was essential to Attila's plan to crush the
empire.
Morale became low. The tribal chieftains challenged
Attila's tactics. Dead horses were eaten and rations
reduced—the Huns' situation became more desperate with each passing day.
This was not the horde of the past. Attila had altered
many of their traditional habits. Now, they were a dis
ciplined army, led by a king who had the patience to
have taken some forty years to unite them.
Attila called his battle captains together in an eve
ning council. He announced that the cost of the siege had become too great. They would bypass Aquileia the next morning. At daybreak, the Huns would begin preparing for their march.
On the following day, taking a final look at the city
he hoped to defeat at another time, Attila observed a stork flying out of Aquileia, driving a young brood
before her. It was destiny—an omen that would turn
the course of events. Announcing that animals could sense things before
men, Attila ordered his army to fulfill the presage of this omen from powers beyond man's comprehension. Now, instead of bypassing Aquileia, they would attack.
Equipped with catapults and tall ladders, the newly disciplined Hunnish horde executed a masterful at

tack. The city, despite its experience with and repel
lence of invasions in the past, fell. It was a swift victory.
Aquileia was left in flames, its vast treasures added to
the booty already overflowing Attila's chariots.
Destiny had been fulfilled through patience and the
ability to sense the precise moment to act.
ATTILA ON: "THE ESSENTIALS
OF DECISIVENESS"
Our seasoned chieftains have become wise through ex
perience as to when it is right to act and when it remains best to contemplate further. On the other hand, our young, ambitious Huns, anxious to demonstrate
their deftness, will often precipitate actions that result
in loss for them, their tribe and perhaps the nation.
Such rashness is unacceptable in those appointed to
lead. All chieftains must learn that victory comes to one who knows not only what to do but when to do it.
Young Huns are taught skill in weaponry—master
ing the bow, the lance, the lariat—and in horseman
ship. They learn the advantage of swift action on the
battlefield. They learn to be forthright in demonstrat
ing these abilities.
As their mentors, we teach them to take the initiative, to have the moral courage and force that make the
difference between followers and leaders. We must, however, demonstrate for them the main points possessed by the leader who travels the determining mile between sporadic and spurious accomplishment and resolute performance in all things. One of these points
is decisiveness.
- 67



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
Now, I give you chieftains counsel for acquiring skill
in decisiveness.
Noble resolve to do the right thing is characteristic
of prudent decision making. Responsible decisions
are difficult to improve upon.
Wise is the chieftain who never makes a decision
when he doesn't understand the issue. In decision
making, valor is guided by prudence.
A chieftain should allow his subordinates the priv
ilege of making decisions appropriate to their level
of responsibility. Weak is the chieftain who reserves
every decision for himself out of fear that he might
lose control.
The circumstances of a given moment are not to be used as an excuse for being unprepared to make
decisions incumbent to a chieftain. Indecisiveness
is bred by failure to accept the responsibility of
office—be it great or small.
A chieftain who fails to accept full decision-making
responsibility—or who blames others for his own
bad decisions—is weak and lacking in an essential,
inherent quality of leadership.
Rarely are there perfect decisions. The best decisions
are usually the more prudent of the logical alter
natives. When you must be overly persuasive in gain
ing support for your decision, it's usually a sign of
a bad one.
When the consequences of your decision are too grim
to bear, look for another option. Compassion is the

THE OMEN OF AQUILEIA: "THE ESSENTIALS OF DECISIVENESS"
byword when making difficult decisions that, un
avoidably, have temporary or long-lasting adverse consequences for even a few Huns.
Next to the importance of knowing when to make a
decision stands the insight to know when to forgo
making one. Impatient chieftains often precipitate premature action.
Perhaps the most critical element of decision mak
ing is timing. Prompt determination after appropri
ate deliberation is a worthy principle of decisiveness.
In selecting an alternative, wise chieftains look for
the choice in which the benefits outweigh the risks
and costs of the decision. Noble chieftains make de
cisions in favor of the common good.
Chieftains are to be cautioned against rushing to conclusions when there is time and opportunity to
improve upon the basic decision.
Wise chieftains often extract from obscure places the
critical elements for making the right decision. The
key is learning to find the obscure places and to
recognize the critical elements.
Skepticism has value in that it delays premature de
cision making. When a chieftain can't make up his mind, it's worthwhile to restate the problem.
Chieftains should delegate only those decisions they
want their subordinates to make. Conversely, chief
tains who inappropriately make decisions for their
subordinate leaders diminish the potential that ex
ists for the young chieftains to learn and grow by
69



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTBLA THE HUN
exercising their judgments and being held account
able for the consequences of their decisions.
Initiative in decision making is not sufficiently dem
onstrated by a chieftain when it occurs only in re
lation to easy assignments. It must be exhibited when
facing difficult and high-risk tasks as well. A sure
sign of a weak chieftain is hesitation to act out of
fear he might fail.
Doubt and delay are frequently symptomatic of
chieftains promoted beyond their capacities. On the
other hand, we often find ourselves in unfortunate
situations in which too many chieftains make too
many decisions with too little wisdom.
Chieftains must avoid decisions that favor them
selves at the expense of the Huns. Every decision is
an opportunity to improve the conditions of the Huns,
the tribe and the nation.
Chieftains grow to understand that the wisdom of a
particular decision can change with time. Make every
effort, therefore, to improve future decisions by
learning from those you've already made.
It takes less courage to criticize the decisions of others than to stand by your own.
Paradoxical as it may seem, sometimes the best decisions are made void of the emotions evoked by the facts bearing on the problem.
It is good to remember that chieftains are, in large,
rewarded for the decisions they make. Huns, con
versely, are, in large, rewarded for how well they
support and carry out decisions.
70



THE OMEN OF AQUILEIA: "THE ESSENTIALS OF DECISIVENESS"
Self-confidence is critical to decisiveness, for with
out it, a chieftain loses his following in challenging
situations.
In the end, vision, drive, energy, singleness of pur
pose, wise use of resources and a commitment to a
destiny worthy of his efforts become a character of
a chieftain who excels.
You chieftains must make the extra effort and dem
onstrate rigor in developing a sense of decisiveness.
Knowing by instinct or by fact when the time is right
for action will yield a high measure of success. Deci
siveness in leadership action carries a heavy burden.
Often it means victory or defeat. We cannot hesitate
to act, but neither can we prematurely precipitate de
cisions that will work to our disadvantage.
71



Horse Holders:
"The Art of
Delegation"
Even as the rider who dismounts and expects to
return to his fiery steed requires a horse holder,
it was necessary that Attila have assistance from his
chieftains in order to attend to all of the responsibilities
that demanded his attention.
In the early stages of his efforts to unify the various
tribes, Attila sought to gain loyalty from easily allied chieftains. Thus, he would have the formidable power of numbers when he challenged more-powerful chief
tains.
As king, he would not be capable of overseeing every
action of his nation, its tribes and its chieftains. He
would require the unfeigned loyalty of trusted chief
tains to whom he could delegate responsibility.
The Hunnish nation had long been wandering, in
dividual tribes that sold their services to any cause for
72



HORSE HOLDERS: "THE ART OF DELEGATION"
a price, or for short-term gains of booty and perhaps even ephemeral moments of peace.
The chieftains and their tribes had lost some defer
ence for Attila as a member of the Hunnish royal family
for he had not been long in their camps, as his childhood
had been spent in the court of the Romans as a hostage.
Waiting patiently, as a spider waits for its prey, Attila
used his time to develop sufficient loyalties and a follow
ing that would yield him chieftains to whom he could del
egate national unification responsibilities. This he could
do with a minimum of risk that they would cast their lots
once again with other chieftains or with foreign leaders.
Risk in delegation was high; however, without ac
cepting such a risk Attila would, alas, have been des
tined to rule over only the tribe of his royal family, and
his greater ambition to unify the tribes into a powerful nation would have been lost.
ATTILA ON:
"THE ART OF DELEGATION"
Our nation cannot prevail as the dominant world power
if its leadership is contained to one man. Even I, Attila, cannot accomplish for you what you are not willing to
accomplish for yourselves. You must be willing to ac
cept the responsibilities that I choose to delegate to you.
At the same time, your charters are too great for you to accomplish alone. You must trust to your subordinate
leaders those responsibilities that fit their office.
Ours is too great and too complex a nation for even
such as I, Attila, to direct and lead every action. I must
entrust you with certain important duties as chieftains
73



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
of your various tribes. If I cannot, we are destined to wander as small bands of nomads.
This gathering is for the purpose of my imparting to
you my counsel regarding the leadership principle of
delegation, which is central to your success as chieftains. Judgment, experience and the incumbent duties of
office dictate the order of delegation. I cannot supply
counsel that applies to each act of delegation. None
theless, I can provide counsel useful to you in the act
and art of delegation.
Learn these precepts well, or your burden will be too
great to accomplish those responsibilities in your charge.
Chieftains should never delegate responsibilities ne
cessitating their direct attention.
Those actions that don't require a chieftains direct
handling are appropriately delegated to the one most
able to fulfill the assignment.
Wise chieftains grant both authority and responsi
bility to those they have delegated assignments.
Wise chieftains always hold their subordinates ac
countable for delegated assignments.
Worthy chieftains accept full responsibility for all
assignments—even those they have delegated to their
subordinates.
Once a chieftain has delegated responsibilities, he
should never interfere, lest his subordinates come to be
lieve that the duties are not truly theirs. Such superfi
cial delegation yields fuiy in the hearts of subordinates.
When asked to, a chieftain should assist a subordi
- 74



HORSE HOLDERS: "THE ART OF DELEGATION"
nate with his delegated tasks—otherwise the sub
ordinate may fail because he is not yet of the mettle necessary to fulfill the assignment.
Realize that a chieftain cannot accomplish every re
sponsibility of his office by himself. Should he prove
otherwise, a leader should understand that he is, in
fact, chieftain over little or nothing at all.
A competent chieftain will delegate important as
signments to even inexperienced subordinates in order that he might accomplish his mission, develop
his subordinates' skills and demonstrate loyalty for
and trust in his subordinates.
A chieftain should surround himself with subordi
nates to whom he feels comfortable delegating assignments. Otherwise, he must perform the incumbencies of both his and their offices.
A chieftain should never punish a subordinate who
has failed if he did his best to carry out a delegated
responsibility.
Chieftains should encourage their subordinates to
use creativity to fulfill delegated responsibilities.
Subordinates will never develop their skills if their
chieftain precisely directs them how to accomplish their delegated assignments.
A wise chieftain expands his influence and ability to
serve the nation only through the art of delegation.
More counsel on this subject escapes me at this time. Perhaps it is best, for I wish not to underwhelm you with weakening thoughts.
75



Booty: "Rewarding
Tour Hum"
Iong hostages of a nomadic life, dependent for sur
vival upon whatever booty they had stored in their
chariots, the Huns were inspired by the glory and spoils
that stemmed from the exploitation of their deeds as
intrepid warriors.
Booty, the spoils of victory, was for many tribes the
mainstay of their existence; they themselves were subject to being swept from conquered lands by nations
who also relished the luxuries gained by vanquishing
others.
Often, their appetites for glory and pillage gained
from victorious battle caused them to forget their gods and heroes and diminished their perspective of national goals. Looting was, for the Huns, simply a part
of postbattle etiquette. More than the prepayment of servitude, the Huns
76



BOOTY: "REWARDING YOUR HUNS"
were attracted by the novel uncertainties of pillage.
War was their method of survival. Their nomadic life required periodic replenishment gained for them
through pillage when the storehouses that were their
chariots grew bare.
Attila understood these customs. He knew the Huns
were driven by intrinsic desires so strong that, simply
to enjoy the spoils of war, the tribes would often become mercenaries for foreign nations and march in campaigns against even other Hunnish tribes.
His role was to harness this desire for short-term
gain—to use discipline in the distribution of booty as
reward for energies spent for the good of the Hunnish
nation—as he set out to realize his people's formidable
potential.
ATTILA ON:
"REWARDING YOUR HUNS"
Booty has become a powerful force that ignites the
spirits of our warriors, driving them to commit their
talents to any nation that bribes them into service.
You, as leaders of your tribes, and I, Attila, as King
of Huns, must turn this lust for booty into a more
disciplined distribution of rewards to Huns who will
ingly give their services to our nation either in or out
of battle.
Booty, as such, is most often a short-lived benefit to which our Huns have become accustomed as their wages of war. We must continue to grant unto our warriors their rights of pillage and at the same time provide
rewards for acts off the battlefield that we endorse.
77



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
Controlling the undisciplined desire for booty among
our horde is necessary for our civilization to triumph
over barbaric customs. For this purpose I, Attila, issue guidance on rewarding your Huns.
Never reward a Hun for doing less than is expected
of him. Otherwise, he will doubt your sincerity in
rewarding appropriate acts and, even worse, expect reward for performing deeds for which you hold no
approval.
Never reward a Hun for every act completed cor
rectly. Otherwise, he will not act in the absence of
your presence or without the certainty of recognition.
Grant small rewards for light tasks. Reserve heaps
of booty for dangerous, gallant, substantial effort and worthy accomplishment.
Praise those who are simply good Huns. Their need
for gratification tends to parallel their level of am
bition. Security is utmost for those who risk not.
Give them, therefore, assurance—not great booty

lest they learn large value is given to those who just
get by.
Sincere concern for and purposeful mingling with
your Huns will raise their spirits and encourage
greater valor.
Teach your Huns that the booty of battle is nothing
more than wages for their service. Heaps of booty, promotion through the ranks and recognition as being a mighty warrior are reserved for those who go be
yond the normal call of duty.
78



BOOTY: "REWARDING YOUR HUNS"
Grant your Huns the benefit of your interest in the
welfare of their families and the condition of their
stores; share your riches with those who are loyal
and stand in need. They will be certain to willingly
follow you into the mouth of hell, should the occa
sion arise.
Care more for the rewarding of your Huns than for rewarding yourself. Your own rewards will then far exceed even your greatest hopes and dreams.
Never give a Hun a reward that holds no value for
yourself.
Never underestimate the ability of the empire or other
foes to gain the support and loyalty of Huns you fail
to heed and rightfully reward.
Be generous with small tokens of appreciation—they
will multiply in returned loyalty and service.
Now, I cannot provide counsel as to the appropri
ateness of every reward for every situation. You, as chieftains, must develop your own judgments, based
upon these principles, into a system of disciplined re
wards that will weld the loyalty of your Huns.

Attila and the Pope:
"The Art of
Negotiation"
The combination of sparse rations, contaminated
water supplies, intense heat, illness and general
listlessness had wrought its toll upon the spirit of the
Hunnish horde in the year a.d. 452. The Italian cam
paign, though unexpectedly successful for Attila's army, was taxing the Huns' endurance. In the Roman court, Valentinian ignored the counsel
of Aetius, who had fallen from favor. After questioning
his generals and senators, Valentinian judged the Ro
man army to be incapable of a victorious engagement with Attila's newly reorganized army. Suing for peace seemed the only hope for the survival of Rome.
But who could Valentinian send to negotiate with the mighty Attila? For whom did Attila hold enough respect that the petition for peace would even be con
sidered?
80



A1TILA AND THE POPE: "THE ART OF NEGOTIATION"
The Christian world held vast reverence for Pope Leo I. He was a man of God, of eloquence and culture, and had even been consulted by the Emperor Valen
tinian in times of difficulty. Attila's army was marshaled at Mantua. Surely Rome would soon be in flames, her storehouses emptied and
her treasury pillaged by the horde. It was a time for
urgent action.
Valentinian called upon the aging pope to gather a
cortege, then to proceed to Attila's camp and sue for
peace and the sparing of Rome—the last stronghold of the empire. The tactic dumbfounded Aetius. He knew Attila's army would fall as it had at Chalons if the empire would but
stall. Aetius, however, was not consulted, and Valen
tinian's plan was put into action.
On the other side of the impending battle, Attila was
hesitant. He feared another defeat by the Romans. Yet
his fury was fired by the humiliations he had suffered
in his youth in Rome. His oath, taken silently as a child,
was to someday destroy the palace, triumphal arches and churches in Rome, a city for which he held contempt. A scout returned to Attila's camp and told of the advance of the Roman army. In quick order, the now
disciplined horde was readied. The march to a final encounter with the legions of Rome began.
Soon after the Huns moved out, the scout returned again. Bewildered, he reported to Attila that it was not
the empire's legions but a procession of priests and monks that approached. It was being led by an old man with a white beard, dressed in white, upon a white
steed.
- 81



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
Calling a halt to the horde's advance, Attila, atop the gallant black charger Villain, rode forward with a few
warriors to inquire as to the nature of this unexpected
delegation.
Halting his warriors on the banks of a river, Attila
challenged the stranger as to his name. "Leo" was the
reply.
It was Attila who rode through the stream to approach this unusual emissary of the Roman court.
There, on the far bank, Attila and the pope held a counsel whose content has never been revealed. For whatever reasons history or legend may give, it
was the destiny of Rome to be spared. For, after a time,
Attila returned to his mighty horde and turned its march first northward and then back to their homeland in the
valley of the Danube.
ATTILA ON:
"THE ART OF NEGOTIATION"
The techniques of negotiation are not easily taught. It
is for both Hun and chieftain to learn skills useful in
negotiating. These are mastered only through understanding gained by experience.
My negotiations at a time when victory seemed so
apparent to my chieftains and warriors, anxious to pillage Rome, were a mysteiy to them. But it was to our advantage to grant respite. Your naivete about the ways of negotiation prevents you from understanding my actions with the pope and the subsequent withdrawal of our army from Italy. For
this purpose I, Attila, gather you in this council to en

ATTILA AND THE POPE: "THE ART OF NEGOTIATION"
lighten you as to how to conduct yourself at those times
when you will be required to negotiate for the good of your Huns and tribes and perhaps our nation.
Now I give to all assembled my counsel, in the hopes
that it will serve to add to your wisdom and your ex
pertise in the leader's vital art of negotiation.
Always maintain the diplomatic initiative in all ne
gotiations. Be on the offense always—never lose
contact with your enemy. This will place him in a
lesser position, and you will have the upper hand.
Always negotiate at the lowest level possible. This
will serve to resolve small things before they grow
out of proportion and make negotiating impossible.
Never trust negotiation to luck. Enter every session armed with knowledge of the enemy's strengths and weaknesses; knowing his secrets makes you strong
and allows you to better deceive him as to your ul
timate goals.
Keep negotiations secret! They must be conducted
in private—even as I did with Pope Leo. Only the
policies should become public knowledge. How they
were negotiated should remain confidential, saving
loss of face.
Time is your ally when you're negotiating. It calms
temperaments and gives rise to less-spirited per
spectives. Never rush into negotiations.
Never arbitrate. Arbitration allows a third party to
determine your destiny. It is a resort of the weak.
Never make negotiations difficult on immediate, lesser

LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
points, at the cost of a greater outcome. Acquies
cence on lesser issues softens the spirit of your ad
versary.
In negotiation you must take well-studied risks. Try
to foresee all possible outcomes to determine those
that will yield favorable results.
Be aware of the temperament in your foe's camp. Take advantage of troubles and turmoils that arise
during negotiations.
Never overestimate your own adroitness. You may
simply be negotiating with a weak opponent. Though
fortuitous, this will not always be the situation.
Never intimidate.
Honor all commitments you make during negotia
tions lest your enemy fail to trust your word in the
future.
Remember, agreement in principle does not dictate
agreement in practice. It does, however, serve to save
face at the moment.
Be bold in facing the inevitable. Acquiesce when re
sistance would be pointless or when your victory can be gained only at too high a cost. Of this you may
not approve, but it is your duty to do so for the good of all Huns.
Be keenly aware of time. Present appealing alternatives that are appropriate to your opponent's sit
uation at the moment of your negotiations. Otherwise,
he will dismiss your propositions.
- 84



ATTELA AND THE POPE: "THE ART OF NEGOTIATION"
Now, you mighty chieftains must come to an understanding of a final simple fact. It is never wise to gain by battle what may be gained through bloodless
negotiations. Reserve the potential loss of your war
riors for great causes not attainable without waging
battle.
With these thoughts, I end this council on the art of
negotiation. Remember this time together in order that
you may always exact negotiations for the betterment
of our nation as we fulfill our destiny of conquering
all before us.
85



Surviving Defeat:
"There Is Another
Day"
Though not unfamiliar with toil, struggle, deception
and other challenges that regularly attend leaders, Attila was unprepared for and unaccustomed to defeat
on the battlefield.
It was Aetius, his lifelong foe, who had so skillfully
led the Roman Legion at the Battle of Chalons, who tore Attila's mighty horde apart and caused them to
retreat.
Attila's will snapped! His confidence in his destiny
deserted him! He turned his sights within, ignoring for
a time the confusion, shouting and wailing that ac
companied the shaken horde as they strayed to safer ground. Wandering about his camp in contemplation of
the errors of the day, Attila was demoralized in this, the
darkest moment of his reign. Was he to become the
- 86



SURVIVING DEFEAT: "THERE IS ANOTHER DAY"
victim of a lost cause? Was he no longer master of the world? Experiencing all of the inner turmoil concomitant
with great disappointments, Attila was suffering as all
responsible leaders do on such occasions.
Yet, drawing upon his inner strengths of dogged te
nacity, determination and extraordinary will, Attila marshaled his emotional stamina and regained control
of himself.
He would not be distracted from his ambitions! He
would reorganize his armies! Introduce new customs to his nation! The Huns would rise again! There would be another day!
ATTILA ON:
"THERE IS ANOTHER DAY"
I, Attila, King of Huns, have called this assembly of
chieftains and mighty warriors together for the purpose of encouragement. Further, my aim is to kindle the fires of your emotional stamina so that you may not become hopeless in the face of disappointment.
It has been a sad experience for me to suffer so great
a defeat as handed me by Aetius. Although I am familiar
with the loneliness of command, with betrayal by those I have trusted and with moments of trouble, I was simply not prepared to suffer the anguish of so paramount a
defeat—and my consequent bewilderment—as met me on the Catalaunian Plains.
It is, therefore, incumbent to my office that I prepare
you chieftains and future chieftains to deal with disappointment and discouragement.
87



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
Your understanding of my internal suffering and then
renewed determination after the Battle of Chalons is
perhaps not well served by a detailed account at this
time.
Rather, I will provide you with specific counsel that
may become useful in dealing with your own future
challenges, for only I can deal with my own defeat.
Therefore, let these guiding principles for dealing with defeat be known among you.
No chieftain will ever win every encounter. It mat
ters not whether it be in tribal leadership or on the
battlefield, nor how great or insignificant is the issue
at hand—sometimes you will lose, regardless of how prepared you are to win.
Should you become aware that defeat on the battle
field or in negotiations is impending, don't deny it. Face it and take immediate action to minimize the opponent's gain and get back to your cause.
Retreat is noble when continuance with the battle
or the issue at hand would result in further losses
or total annihilation of your resources. In order to
return on another day, you must salvage all the war
riors and materiels possible.
Momentary loss of self-worth, -confidence and -determination are normal emotions that accompany personal loss. Learn that you must pass through
this misery to rid your Hunnish spirit of its depression. Lament, if necessary, but do not dwell too long on your bad moments lest they rise to rule your emotions forever.
- 88



SURVIVING DEFEAT: "THERE IS ANOTHER DAY"
A wise chieftain avoids exposing his Huns to possible
defeat if they are not yet prepared to deal effectively
with disappointment.
It is wise to consider all potentialities of battle and
negotiations before entering into them. Rehearse them in your mind. Think of the consequences that may result from your actions. This will allow you to be better prepared for the worst outcome.
Learn from defeat! If you fail to sharpen your lead
ership prowess after confronting unconquered ob
stacles, your experiences were for naught, and you,
as well as your subordinates, will become nothing
more than a helpless victim.
Always remember that worthy causes meet with the
most resistance—even internal withholding of sup
port and loyalty. If victory is easily gained, you must
reconsider the worthiness of your ambitions.
It is a simple truth that the greater your accomp
lishments—your victories—the greater opposition,
torment and discouragement your enemies will throw in your path. Expect it! Don't become a victim of it.
Know that your most worthy efforts will be scorned by your peers, for it is they who suffer most when you excel. If your actions and ambitions threaten
them not, you're simply striving toward the insig
nificant.
Reserve a portion of your emotional stamina for those
times when to overcome obstacles requires even your last resources. Never expend all your energies in the

charge when retreat and regrouping has even the
slightest potential of happening.
Alas, the campfire has dwindled on this gathering. Be it to your advantage that you learn from my agonies.
Let these insights to my secrets be the fuel to ignite
the fires of your determination to retreat and regroup your ambitions for success on another day. For as long
as a Hun breathes, all is not lost.

The Bones of
Caravans Past:
"Lessons Learned"
B
y nightfall, the Catalaunian Plains were heaped
•with some 162,000 to 300,000 slain Huns, the
aftermath of the Battle of Chalons, in which Attila's
lifelong nemesis, Aetius, had dealt his army its only
defeat.
Aetius had employed delay tactics at the start of the
battle. He knew deceptiveness as to the moment and place where the main encounter would begin would irritate Attila and would weaken his army's morale and determination.
Frustrated by the delay in battle, the Huns finally charged in mid-afternoon. The earth shook as thousands upon thousands of Hunnish chargers pounded the ground, tearing headlong into battle. The shields of the Roman army turned aside the
91



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN
avalanche of arrows that Aetius knew would precede
the axes and javelins of the horde. The fury continued as the Huns, now dismounted, began hand-to-hand combat with the well-trained and
-disciplined infantry under Aetius' command. The Romans' bronze helmets and metallic body armor rendered the stone-headed axes of the horde use
less. Their long lances and lariats served only to
encumber the horde as the fighting turned savage.
Aetius had used his knowledge of Attila's tactics to
the victorious advantage of the Latin and Frankish soldiers who composed his army.
The dazzling brilliance of his horde's accomplish
ments on battlefields past had not served Attila in his quest to annihilate the powerful enemy army and its
leader, Aetius. Attila, unlike Aetius, had prepared nei
ther himself nor his horde for the struggle so valiantly
fought and lost on the Catalaunian Plains.
ATTILA ON:
"LESSONS LEARNED"
The dreaded enemy led by Aetius used tactics unfamiliar to our noble warriors on the Catalaunian Plains. Many of our brave Huns were lost in a battle for which I simply had not prepared them to fight. We have held too long to a strategy marked by swift movement, dealing death from horseback with long lances and dragging the enemy to his end by our lariats. Our battle dress and armament has been designed to
serve us only under such conditions. They are not suited
for infantry warfare against soldiers equipped with
92



THE BONES OF CARAVANS PAST: "LESSONS LEARNED"
shields, helmets and suits of armor. The swords of the
enemy have proven superior to our stone axes.
Alas, ours was a plan more aligned with past victo
ries. Our discipline and patience wore thin under the
provocation of Aetius' stalling tactics. Our fury was
prematurely unleashed, which led to our suffering de
feat. We are unaccustomed to losing. We are winners. We must examine the now sun-bleached bones of our lost warriors. We must regroup and emerge with re
newed vigor and purpose and return to deal defeat to our enemy. As we howl for our lost ones and ponder our suffer
ings, we must likewise learn the mighty lessons in them
if we are to rise up with the strength of spirited warriors who want not to be at the mercy of the Romans!
Now, I, Attila, must relay to you the learning I accumulated in my study of the bones of caravans past.
Our army must become more commandable in bat
tle. We must create a new battle plan with a better arrangement of our chieftains and Huns. We must
use tactics that control our maneuvers.
We must refrain from charging prematurely and fu
riously into unfamiliar situations.
We must not be unprepared for new tactics employed by the enemy. We must watch him closely,
using our intelligence, to detect and assess his likely methods.
When we are outfitted in battle dress and armament of inferior utility, we must never engage an enemy. Future battles with the Romans demand us to cover

in these tactics will balance our abilities to wage war.
We must add catapults to our arsenal. We cannot
expect the high walls of Roman bastions to crumble
at the simple beating of our chargers' hoofs.
We cannot presume to rule over the Romans and conquer the world as wandering tribes of nomads.
We must build cities. These cities must be fortified
centers for our planning. From them we will send
out well-disciplined and -trained armies—well supplied and armed with the new weapons of a su
perior arsenal.
We cannot expect to change our long-held traditions,
to reorganize our army and to create great cities
without internal opposition. Among you chieftains
and Huns will be those whose spirits cling to our
past ways. We will show patience with you unenlightened ones. Yet, if you choose not our new course
and cause dissension, you will be stricken from our
ranks.
Our vision of the future must build on the strength
of the past. Yet, we must anticipate new challenges
and opportunities. Suffering another Battle of Chalons is unacceptable to me as your king and to our
people, who depend on us, their leaders and war
riors, to serve their interests and ambitions.

THE BONES OF CARAVANS PAST: "LESSONS LEARNED"
We must never fail to analyze the past. No bleached bone of a battle-lost Hun must go unnoticed as we prepare for the future by laying aside the ill
conceived and undisciplined strategies of our past.
We must form new policies and practices into a Hun
nish unity of well-defined purpose. We must plan to
once again and forever excel against all enemies and
overcome obstacles that stand in the way of our conquering the world.
Now, in ending my counsel on lessons learned from
the study of bones of caravans past, I leave you with
a parting bit of wisdom. No radical change is easy.
Radical change is only necessary when we fail to learn
from our past in anticipating the future. The greatest
adversary to abandoning the ineffectiveness of our past
is a reluctance among yourselves to demonstrate the
spirited support of your king, who seeks for you a new
trail toward achieving things good for all Huns.

Ashes to Ashes:
"Departing with
Nobility"
His death came unexpectedly. It happened at a
time when he was about to lead his reorganized and formidable army into a new quest to conquer the empire. Attila was dead! His warriors and chieftains were
stunned! Women wept! Children feared! Their noble king was gone forever! The Hunnish nation had prematurely
lost its central figure of unity, pride and leadership.
Although still in shock, the high priests prepared for
the burial ceremony. As Attila lay on a high bier in the main square of Etzelburg, a black horse was offered
in sacrifice as the sightless high priest Kama asked the departed Hunnish spirits how their king should be buried. The answer directed that Attila be buried in a triple
coffin: the first of gold like the sun; the second of silver,
as the tail of a comet; the third of iron, for Attila was of iron. To prevent any threat of disturbance of the
96



ASHES TO ASHES: "DEPARTING WITH NOBILITY"
beloved king in his final rest, Kama was told by the
spirits to bury Attila at the bottom of the Tisza River.
A dam was constructed to divert a small channel of the
river, and a grave was prepared in the riverbed. As thousands sang mournful songs and shouted min
gled cries, the funeral wagon was led to the grave site
by twelve black horses, preceded by a riderless Villam saddled and draped with black cloth. The royal family, nobles, chief warriors and bareheaded Hun grandees followed the coffin on foot.
Joined by people from allied nations, some having
traveled as long as three days, the sea of mourners
carried thousands of torches as the sun descended in the western sky. Then, with a roll of drums and final
blasts of tribute from his army's bugles, Attila was laid
to rest. The dam was broken, and the waters rushed
to protect the site from all future evil. A legend was gone. In the future, his name would be held in both high esteem and contempt, but he would long be remembered for his deeds as Attila, King of Huns.
ATTILA ON:
"DEPARTING WITH NOBILITY"
Being assigned to any position of leadership over our
Huns or tribes is gratifying. Worthy leaders fill the void between what Huns can do without a leader and what they can accomplish with one. Each chieftain is unique, marked by his mannerisms and his personal commitment to fulfill the obligations assumed in accepting his
office.
It is soon after a new chieftain is appointed that he
will either grow or diminish in the eyes of his subor
97



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
dinates, peers and superiors. If he is prudent in the
application of his authority, demonstrates a spirit of
commitment and sees to it that all obligations are met,
the chieftain will enlarge his stature. Then, he will have
gained personal loyalty, trust, confidence and respect from all Huns under his command, from his peers and
superiors. Some truly outstanding chieftains may even
stir up jealousy in those leaders who are less capable
in their positions.
Nonetheless, a strong bond will develop between a true chieftain and his Huns. They will begin to emulate
him, perhaps speak of him in their casual conversation.
They may make him the subject of tales reflecting his courage, persona and accomplishments. In the end,
they will ride into the mouth of hell for him, for he
becomes more than an ordinary chieftain—he be
comes their chieftain, one they are proud to serve.
As time passes, it is the tendency for both chieftain
and Huns to cloud their objectiveness of perception and fail to remember that the incumbent in any po
sition of leadership is subject to ephemeral assign
ments. Either a new assignment, old age or death will eventually remove even the most tenured and greatest
chieftain from his office. Thus, it is a tender moment in the lives of all who have developed strong bonds of loyalty and dedication when the former chieftain passes on and a new one is
appointed in his place. This transition of leadership, influence and power must be made with the adroitness of diplomacy and protocol to serve the good of the Huns, tribe and nation. For this purpose, I provide this counsel to both chieftains and Huns regarding depar
ture with nobility.
- 98



ASHES TO ASHES: "DEPARTING WITH NOBILITY"
It is the wise chieftain who prepares himself for the eventual moment when his time has passed and a
new chieftain is about to take charge. This prepa
ration should be made over time, to avoid precipi
tating insecurity or loss of commitment or dissipating
confidence.
It is noble for the departing chieftain to express grat
itude to all who have served him well, especially recognizing ways in which they have made him stronger and more resilient.
It is noble for Huns to honor their departing chief
tain, giving recognition and appreciation for his ser
vice to them.
It is noble for the departing chieftain to voice his
confidence that the new chieftain will serve his Huns
well, perhaps even improving their conditions. This
expression, even if offered in a token fashion, re
duces moments of insecurity and worry for the Huns who remain.
It is noble for the departing chieftain to leave his
command forever, never attempting to return by influencing the Huns once in his command. In doing
so, he would subvert the leadership authority and
responsibility of the new chieftain. Such action by
the old chieftain would be destructive, even if invited by seemingly innocent appeal from Huns who once
trusted his counsel. Every appeal of this nature should
be denied, and the former chieftain should reaffirm
his commitment to the new one by directing the
Huns to seek counsel from their rightful leader.
99



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
Regardless of the conditions under which a former
chieftain departs his camp—no matter how distaste
ful or dishonorable—the new leader should neither
encourage nor tolerate disrespectful talk of him.
Speaking ill will not change past events or serve to
further the Huns' understanding. It will most cer
tainly tarnish the stature of the new leader.
If departure should come prematurely, without
warning or preparation to receive a new chieftain,
tremendous confusion will reign in the camp. This
is the most difficult situation for all. Those who rank
highest, the senior Huns and chieftains, must quickly
form a council and choose a new leader. For, in dire
circumstances, our Huns look to their chieftain for
strength, courage and direction.
Even as I, Attila, King of Huns, must someday be suc
ceeded in my reign, my reflections and memories will be
sweet only if I feel I have prepared the nation for this inevitable moment. And, if I have prepared you well, you will continue to be a nation of united tribes who seek to improve life for the Huns. For loyalty should not be solely
placed in a man—no matter his personal magnetism. Loyalty of the Huns should have balance in the commitment of all to serve as a unified nation of Huns with
out hesitation, no matter who reigns over you.*
*It is perhaps important for the reader to understand that Attila had no successor of his capability. No chieftain or prince emerged after his death who possessed the richness of his views or the depth of his commitment. The Huns became divided again, most tribes resumed their nomadic life, battles were lost and the once strong nation was absorbed into greater Europe. The vanity of the princes and chieftains who jealously sought to succeed him resulted in the downfall of the nation. They had simply failed to learn from
Attila—seeking first their own interests rather than those of the nation.

ADVICE AND COUNSEL
Written reports have purpose only if read by the

CHARACTER
The greatness of a Hun is measured by the sacrifices
he is willing to make for the good of the nation.
A chieftain should always rise above pettiness and cause his Huns to do the same.
A chieftain cannot win if he loses his nerve. He should
be self-confident and self-reliant and even if he does
not win, he will know he has done his best.
A chieftain does not have to be brilliant to be suc
cessful, but he must have an insatiable hunger for
victory, absolute belief in his cause and an invincible
courage that enables him to resist those who would
otherwise discourage him.
Seldom are self-centered, conceited and self
admiring chieftains great leaders, but they are great
idolizers of themselves.
Great chieftains never take themselves too seriously.
A wise chieftain adapts—he doesn't compromise.
Chieftains who drink with their Huns become one with them and are no longer their chieftain.
Weak chieftains surround themselves with weak Huns.

As a chieftain achieves greater success, the jealousy
others feel for him intensifies.

COURAGE
Huns must learn early that working through a hardship is an experience that influences them all the days
of their lives.
Successful Huns learn to deal with adversity and to
overcome mistakes.
A Hun can achieve anything for which he is willing
to pay the price. Competition thins out at the top of

ways the best decisions.
Chieftains should never rush into confrontations.
A chieftain's confidence in his decision making preempts name-dropping to his Huns.
It is unfortunate when final decisions are made by chieftains headquartered miles away from the front,

LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTTLA THE HUN
where they can only guess at conditions and poten
tialities known only to the captain on the battlefield.
When victory will not be sweet, the chieftain must
keep his Huns from war.
The ability to make difficult decisions separates

where their weaknesses will prevail over their
strengths.
Good Huns normally achieve what their chieftain expects from them.
A wise chieftain never expects his Huns to act beyond their wisdom and understanding.
A wise chieftain always gives tough assignments to
Huns who can rise to the occasion.
Abdication is not delegation. Abdication is a sign of

Strong chieftains always have strong weaknesses. A
king's duty is to make a chieftain's strengths prevail.
Huns learn less from success than they do from
failure.
Huns learn much faster when faced with adversity.

A good chieftain takes risks by delegating to an in
experienced Hun in order to strengthen his leader
ship abilities.
The experience of Huns must be structured to allow them to broaden and deepen themselves to develop the character they will need when appointed a
chieftain.
Huns are best prepared to become chieftains when
given appropriate challenges at successively higher
levels of responsibility.
If it were easy to be a chieftain, everyone would
be one.
Without challenge, a Hun's potential is never realized.
Appropriate stress is essential in developing chieftains.
DIPLOMACY AND POLITICS
When in a political war, a Hun must always keep an
eye to the rear.
The essence of Hunnish victory lies in the answers to the questions Where? and When?
Huns should engage only in wars they can win.
Huns may enter war as the result of failed diplomacy; however, war may be necessary for diplomacy
to begin.
For Huns, conflict is a natural state.
Huns only make enemies on purpose.

Huns never take by force what can be gained by diplomacy.
Chieftains should remember that hospitality, warmth
and courtesy will captivate even the most oppres
sive foe.
Chieftains are often betrayed by those they trust most.

LEADERS AND LEADERSHIP
Kings should always appoint their best Huns as chieftains, no matter how much they are needed in
their current position.
- 106



ATTILAISMS: SELECTED THOUGHTS OF ATTILA
Never appoint acting chieftains. Put the most ca
pable Hun in charge, give him both responsibility
and authority, then hold him accountable.
A wise chieftain never depends on luck. Rather, he
always trusts his future to hard work, stamina, te
nacity and a positive attitude.

A Hun who takes himself too seriously has lost his
perspective.

107



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATITLA THE HUN
Huns who appear to be busy are not always working.
It is best if your friends and foes speak well of you;
however, it is better for them to speak poorly of you than not at all. When nothing can be said of a Hun, he has probably accomplished nothing very well.
Contrary to what most chieftains think, you're not remembered by what you did in the past, but by what most Huns think you did.
PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT
There is more nobility in being a good Hun than in
being a poor chieftain.
Even the Romans have the strength to endure the
misfortunes they bring on others.
If all Huns were blind, a one-eyed warrior would be
king.
Great chieftains accept failure at some things in or
der to excel in more important ones.
Every Hun is responsible for shaping his life's cir
cumstances and experiences into success—no other
Hun, and certainly no Roman, can do for a Hun what
he neglects to do for himself.
PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
Huns should be taught to focus on opportunities rather than on problems.
- 108



ATTILAISMS: SELECTED THOUGHTS OF ATTILA
Some Huns have solutions for which there are no
problems.
REWARD AND PUNISHMENT
If an incompetent chieftain is removed, seldom do we appoint his highest-ranking subordinate to his
place. For when a chieftain has failed, so likewise
have his subordinate leaders.
If you tell a Hun he is doing a good job when he
isn't, he will not listen long and, worse, will not be
lieve praise when it is justified.
TOLERANCE
Every Hun has value—even if only to serve as a bad example.
The error in appointing an incompetent chieftain is
in leaving him in a position of authority over other Huns.
To experience the strength of chieftains we must
tolerate some of their weaknesses.
Suffer long for mediocre but loyal Huns. Suffer not for competent but disloyal Huns.
TRAINING
Adequate training of Huns is essential to war and cannot be disregarded by chieftains in more peaceful
times.
109



LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTDLA THE HUN
Teachable skills are for developing Huns. Learnable
skills are reserved for chieftains.
The consequence for not adequately training your
Huns is their failure to accomplish that which is
expected of them.
