Vedic Nada Brahma And The Indus Script
Vijayabhaarati






Vedic Nada Brahma And The Indus Script
Abstract
It is interesting to note that the term rava/svar denote the sun,sky
Veda and seven musical notes. “Sruti ” denote both veda
and twelve music/musical pitches.Vedic texts call the universe as naada brahma.
Vedic knowledge has influenced the life and art of India and the
world including music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, painting,religion, law,creative writing, architecture , sculpture and industries from time immemorial.IVC seals show that the concept of the seven notes and 12 pitches were developed by the vedic people.Vedic studies of Chandas(metre) and Ragas led to the development of Hindustani and Carnatic music in India.
Vedic texts consider this universe existing as naada (na/ra , ,

The Apara(rava/purva/surya , /abda) Brahman mentioned by Mandukya Upanishad is Naada(rava/na-aasa) Brahman or Sabda(tapasa-sun/divasa-day/svar) Brahman. Siva Samhita states that whenever and wherever there is causal stress or Divine action, there is vibration (spandan or kampan), and wherever there is vibration or movement there sound (sabda) is inevitable.

Sa-bda(abda-year,a/sa-god,pada-seat,word cf.pad-na,Padma,vaca
na,savana,na-aya/ayana/ya-ma/ina/yaana , ) stands for word manifested by sound ('verbal') and such a word has innate power to convey a particular sense or meaning (artha cf.ratha/rasa/soma/lata/dasa in kaNTha to make soma skanda
, , , ).



According to the Nyaya(na-aya;nii,niyama,nigama,aagama ) and
the Vaisheshika schools, Sabda(sa-var ,padma , , ,
) means verbal testimony; to the Sanskrit grammarians, Yaska, Panini and Katyayana it meant
a unit of language or speech or vac . In the philosophical terms this word appears for the first time in the Maitri Upanishad (Sloka VI.22) that speaks of two kinds of Brahman - Sabda Brahman ('Brahman with sound' cf.dina with svar) and Asabda Brahman ('soundless Brahman' cf.nisa without svar/ brahman. Nisa>Sani>Sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni.Sani is significator of
music.Narada-netra-rasana and Sarasvati have own musical instrument-ViiNa/va-ina/yama and KRshNa plays a venu/ murali cf.pulari cf. pular: day-break, dawn/ veNu/bhaanusun). BhartRhari speaks about the creative power of sabda, the
manifold universe is a creation(sruti/kRti ,S-RshTi>d-RshTi
, ) of Sabda Brahman (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad IV.i.2). Vac/Speech is equated with Brahman
(Satapatha Brahmana 2.1.4.10 cf. “In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God , and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him.”John.1.1.).The Rg Veda states that Brahman extends as far as Vāc (R.V.X.114.8 .Sun moves in the limits of the sky cf.John.1.1 . Svar(sa-kaNTha/skanda/ skandha, patra on skandha/amzasomaskanda-veda grantha)
, , , , , , , , , , is sun, sky and
vac.Sun’s seat is svar/vac/the sky!), and has hymns in praise of Speech as the Creator (R.V.X.71.7,prahna>nayana> dRshTi> sRshTi.Nisa is asabda without creation.DRshTi/sRshTi begins with prahna/brahma/praaNa/appearance of light) and as the



final abode of Brahman (R.V.I.164.37). Samaya/samaa/kaala/time is the creative power of Sabda Brahman. Svar(sky,sun ,sabda,
patra,putra, praja, varsha,srava) is dRshTi / sRshti/kRti/sruti
/soma/ savana/ avana/ ayana/vana/nava/ nabha/phaNa/moksha-salvation!
Purva(surya/svar/pu-rava/su-rabhi) Mimamsa deals with Sabda Brahman ('cosmic sound or word') which is endowed with names and forms and is projected in vedic revelations (the mantras, hymns, prayers etc.). Vedanta deals with Parama(nRpa/
Padma/parNa/varNa/para/rava , , , , ) Brahman ('the Ultimate Reality') which is transcendent and devoid of material names and material forms. One has to become well established in Sabda Brahman before realizing Parama (nRpa/Padma/ bhrama!) Brahman. Vedas are not the product of conventional language but the emanation of reality in the form of Sabda (sound, word,speech,pada,veda) which is the sole cause of creation and is sanatana(sa-nadam)/ eternal. Purva
(suurya,king) Mimamsa(mina-amsa/aasana/ajna , niyama/nigama-ajna/veda vakya/deva vakya), an esoteric discipline, from the point of view of spiritual growth aims at attaining the heavenly happiness by realizing Sabda(svar/ soma/moksha/na-ukta) Brahman (cosmic sound) by conducting yajnas(agna/ savana/vacana/ svana/vaaja/ vaasa/vac) that help control the senses and the mind; when the mind and the senses are subdued the inner subtle sound is realized as Sabda Brahman.
The fundamental theory of Indian classical music, art and poetry is grounded in the theory of Nada Brahman(cf.Sruu naada/ Suura sena) or Sabda Brahman, and is linked with the Vedic
religion. The Apara(rava/dva/diva ,Heb.yom) , ,



Brahman mentioned by Mandukya Upanishad is Nada Brahman or Sabda(svar/sarva/srava/visva/sarpa) Brahman. Siva Samhita/sangiita/sam-giita/soma –giita) states that whenever and wherever there is causal stress or Divine action, there is vibration (spandan or kampan), and wherever there is vibration or movement there sound (Sabda) is inevitable. "M" of Aum(na
veda,ma-yama,Heb.yom,ra,nau,nava,rava,dva,diva,deva,veda ), the primordial vac represents sabda which is the root and essence of everything; it is Pranava(rava-nau,rava-nava,nRpava) and Pranava is Vedas(sa-aum,soma,su-na,su-ra,rusha, sru), Vedas are Sabda Brahman. Consciousness in all beings is Sabda Brahman.
Sangiita (saṃgīta cf.Rg sanhita,sat gira,sal lekhana,ashTa
mangala), refers to "music and associated performance arts" in
the Indian traditions. According to Guy Beck, the root "saṃ , ,
, , , (nad/tama/soma/ medha/masa/ amsa/sma/ mukha/aja/aga/suurya/kumbha cf.The sign seventh to the
aja/aga/sa/hari/Rg/Leya/Deo/Agastya /August/ Augustus/solar sign is Kumbha/Kumbh-aga/Kumbha-ka itself)-" implies "combining, coming together, convergent wholesome blending, unison" in the context of musical arts.
When the necessity of directing the Mantra (identical to Ishta/candra/soma/su-na/su-ra) internally and to objects externally is transcended ,then one gains Mantra(dharma/
sramana/sankara/kRshNa/grantha) caitanya , , , ,
, , , , , which then awakens Atma(sun,son, anta, sma cf.Narayana-god,niryaaNa-death) caitanya, the Divine Consciousness, and unites with it(anta/sma/samaa
dhaana /santaana/smasaana/RIP). The Mantra is Sabda



Brahman and Ishta , , , is the light of
Consciousness. The body ,praana, and mind along with the entire universe, are all expressions of Mantra(mantha-ra/na
naada/na-antara/na-netra , , /nandana/ vandana/ bandhana/ candra/sankara/KRshNa/ darsana/ sramana/
dharma/soma/varsha/sam-vatsa-ra ) caitanya. At the
ultimate level of Sabda Brahman transcendental words (Nama
Brahman, Holy name , , , ) become materially wordless, transcendental forms become materially formless (rise from lower gunas to higher and transformed from material sattva to transcendental shuddha-sattva) and all multiplicity unified in Consciousness residing in that transcendent glory extends beyond mind and speech.
In the Bhagavad Giita (Sloka VI.44) the term Sabda Brahman has been used to mean Vedic injunctions. Adi Sankara explains that the Yogic impressions do not perish even when held up for a long period, even he who seeks to comprehend the essence of Yoga(yu-ka) and begins to tread the path of Yoga goes beyond the spheres of the fruits of Vedic works, he sets them aside. In this context Srimad Bhagavatam (Sloka III.33.7) has also been relied upon to high-light the disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced transcendentalists. Gaudapada clarifies that the letter "a" of Aum leads to Visva(Vishnu), the letter "u"" leads
to Taijasa( suuryakanti /suuryatejas/sobha/soma/siva) and the letter "m" leads to Prajna (bhrajana/prahna/brahma/
purushan/pavamaana/pu-naama/na , ). With regard to one freed from letters, there remains no attainment (Mandukya Karika I.23). Aum(nau,rava,agna;sankha naada,Sinha naada,sihaasana,bhadraasana,garjana,Rg nada,sruu



naada,Suurasena , , , , ,
) is Sabda Brahman, Aum is the Root Sound of which creation is a series of permutations.Veda becomes soma/nada brahma by beginning the hymns with Aum/nau/ nava/rava/
dva/sva/svaha/su-vac/su-na/su-ra .
According to the Tantric concept, Sound is the first manifestation of Parama Siva(Samba Siva/Savana siva/ Somadeva/
Somanatha) , , , , , , ; in its primary stage it is a psychic wave. Its very existence entails the presence of spandan or movement ('vibration') without which there cannot be sound; spandan is the quality of Saguna brahman and the world is the thought-projection of Saguna Siva. The first sutra
of Sarada(satra/sarat/ ishTi/stu/stava/vatsa) Tilaka , , explains the significance and hidden meaning of Sabda Brahman(divasa/vatsa/vasata brahman/agnishToma/ashTa
mangala/asta sankara/sat lekhana/Hariscandra/Rg mantra ,
.Since sound cannot travel through vacuum, without particles present for vibrations to take place,the mantras can’t reach the sun god and ultimately this becomes sabda bhrama and maaya/ ayana/yaama/samaya/tanaya/yajna/ go-spel !)

Vedic Chandas(sat/sata/dasa/ashTa/shad/Rca/rasanaada/gaana/saama/medha/netra/maatra/metre)
Vedic metre refers to the poetic metre in the Vedic literature. The study of Vedic metre, along with post-Vedic metre, is part



of Chandas, one of the six Vedanga(shadanga/sRnga/satagna/ashTa naaga/sat gaana/sat gaaya) disciplines.

In addition to these seven, there are fourteen less frequent ones syllable-based metres (Varna-vritta or Akshara-chandas):
- 8. Atijagati (13x4); 9. Śakkarī (14x4); 10. Atiśakarī (15x4); 11. Ashṭi (16x4);

- 20. Atikṛiti (25x4); 21. Utkṛiti (26x4).



(Note: all metres have several varieties (from 2 to 30 depending on the case).
There is also the metre called Dandaka which is the general name given to other metres of this class exceeding the measure (26x4) of Utkriti (Dandaka is the No. 22 on the list compiled by H.H. Wilson).
Furthemore, there are several other minor metres found in the Vedas, of which the following are two examples:
Virāj: 4 lines of 10 syllables) ,INRI.
Kakubh: 3 lines of 8, 12, 8 syllables).
Gāyatrī metre
The shortest and most sacred of Vedic metres is the Gāyatrī
metre. A verse consists of three octosyllabic sections (pāda) ,
. The following is an example of the opening of a Rgvedic hymn in Gāyatrī metre:
The hymn:
इन्द्रमिद्गामिनो बृहमिन्द्रिे र्कमिरिमर्कणः इंन्द्र वाणीरनूषत ॥१॥
Transliteration in 3x8 format: índram íd gāthíno br̥hád índram arkébhir arkíṇaḥ índraṃ vá ṇīr anūṣata

Translation: The chanters have loudly chanted to Indra, the singers have sung their songs to Indra, the musicians have resounded to Indra.
— Rgveda 1.7.1, Translator: Frits Staal[17]
The Gāyatrī metre is considered as the most refined and sacred of the Vedic metres, and one that continues to be part of modern Hindu culture as part of Yoga and hymns of meditation at sunrise.
The general scheme of the Gāyatrī is a stanza of three 8-syllable lines. The length of the syllables is variable, but the rhythm tends to be iambic (ᴗ – ᴗ –), especially in the cadence (last four syllables) of each line. However, there is one rare variety, used for example in Rigveda 8.2.1–39, in which the cadence is trochaic (– ᴗ – x). Another cadence sometimes found (especially in the first line of a stanza) is (ᴗ ᴗ ᴗ x). The last syllable of a line may be long or short indifferently.
The Gāyatrī metre makes up about 25% of the entire Rigveda. The only metre more commonly used in Rgveda than Gāyatrī is
the Tristubh(Rca stava/srii stava/srii suta/srii vatsa) metre. The structure of Gāyatrī and other Vedic metres is more flexible than post-Vedic metres.
One of the best known verses of Gāyatrī is the Gayatri Mantra,
which is taken from book 3.62.10 (the last hymn of the 3rd book) of the Rgveda.
When the Rg-Veda is chanted, performers traditionally recite the first two padas of Gāyatrī without making a break between them, in accordance with the generally used saṃhitā text. However, according to Macdonell, "there is no reason to believe that in the original text the second verse was more sharply divided from the



third than from the first." When the Gayatri Mantra is recited, on the other hand, a pause is customarily made after each pada.
When there is a pause, a short syllable at the end of a line can be considered long, by the principle of brevis in longo.
Although the Gāyatrī is very common in the Rgveda, it fell out of use early and is not found in Sanskrit poetry of the classical period. There is a similar 3 x 8 stanzaic metre in the Avestan scriptures of ancient Iran.

Now follows the Great Inauguration {mahabhisheka) of Indra. The gods, headed by Prajapati, said to one another (pointing with their hands to Indra) : " This one is among the gods the most vigorous, most strong, most valiant, most perfect, who carries out best any work (to be done). Let us install him (to the kingship over us)." They all consented to perform just this ceremony (mahabhisheka) on Indra. They brought for him that throne-seat, which is Rg(hari/puru/kuru)-formed.

The Rg verses were made the threads of the texture(kali varsha/vatsara/ vastra/ushTra/vishTara) which went lengthwise, the Samans were the threads which went cross ways, the Yajus verses the intervals in the texture. They made fthe goddess of Glory its covering, and the goddess of fortune its pillow, Savitar and BRhaspati were holding its two fore-legs, Vayu

Indra then ascended the throne-seat, addressing it thus : " May
the Vasus (cf.ashTavasus-4 couples in the cart;vasu>subha>siva>soma>su-na) ascend thee with the
Gayatri metre , , , , with the Trivrit Stoma, with the Rathantara Sama. After them I
then ascend for obtaining universal sovereignty (sarva damana/Visvamitra/samraaja/cakravartin/Bharata/Peter). May the Rudras(rusha-ra/vatsara) ascend thee with the Trishtubh metre,the fifteen-fold Stoma, and the Brihat Sama. After them then I ascend for obtaining increase of
enjoyment. May the Adityas ascend thee with the Jagati metre, the seventeen- fold Stoma, and the Vairupa Sama. After them I ascend for obtaining independent rule. May the Visve Devah ascend thee with the Anushtubh metre, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and the Vairaja Sama. After them I ascend for obtaining distinguished rule.



May the divine Sadhyas and Aptyas ascend thee with the Pankti metre, the Trinava (twenty-seven- fold cf.praNavaaum;praNaya-love) Stoma, and the Sakvara Sama. After
them I ascend for obtaining royal power. May the divine Maruts and Angiras ascend thee with the Atichandas metre; the thirty-three-fold(cf.dvi-ravi-srii) Stoma, and the Raivata
Saama. After them, then, I ascend for obtaining the fulfilment of the highest desires for becoming a great king,for supreme mastership, independence, and a long residence. By these
words, one should ascend the throne-seat.
After Indra had seated himself on this throne-seat, the
Visve Devah said to him, " Indra cannot achieve any feat if he is not everywhere publicly proclaimed as hero ; but if he be thus proclaimed, he can do so." They then consented to do so, and consequently, turning towards Indra, cried aloud (calling him by all his titles.cf.titles of Augustus Caesar/INRI).
The gods bestowed on him (Indra), by proclaiming him as "samrat(universal ruler;somraja)," universal rule ; by proclaiming him as "bhokta(enjoyer of pleasures)," they made him father (of pleasures) ; by proclaiming him as
" svaraj(independent ruler)," they granted him independence of rule ; by proclaiming him as "virat(distinguished king)," they conferred on him royal distinction;
by proclaiming him " rajan(king)," rajapitR (they made him father of kings) ; by calling him " prameshTha(one who has attained the highest desires)," they granted him fulfil
ment of the highest desires.
The king is inaugurated as the father/bhartR/somapa/pater/ Peter/Bharata/Rshabha/KRshNa/Sargon in heaven/svarga/

this: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil.'" The eucharist , is the body(sariira/srii-ra) of the son/sun of god given as food(bhakshaNa/bhaga-asana/vaha-asana;sariira raksha>sariira-rakta>body and blood)!
(The gods then continued proclaiming his heroic virtues in the
following manner) : " The Kshatra(saka-ratha/sahasra/saghasra;kshetra ) is born ; the Kshatriya is born ;
the supreme master of the whole creation is born ; the devourer of the (hostile) tribes is born ; the destroyer of the hostile castles is born ;the slayer of the Asuras is born ; the protector of the Brahma is born ;the protector of the religion is born."
Heroic deeds of the kings were praised and if not real ones were there,those were fabricated and praised!

With the mind's eye I think that I behold them who first performed this sacrificial worship. 7 They who were versed in ritual and metre(cf.maana/chandas/gaana), in hymns and rules, were

Hindustani and Carnatic music
Hindustani(cf.Sindhu/Indu/dhvani/svana/soma) music originated during the Vedic IVC period. Carnatic Music originated during the Bhakti movement. Therefore both have links with the vedic religion. Both music developed with Sanskrit language scripts in the vedic tradition.
Carnatic music owes its name to the Sanskrit term Karnâtaka Sangîtam(cf.karNa>srava>svara>sruti>veda,pitch,dvadasa,rava
rasa,Divodasa , , ) which denotes “traditional” or “codified” music. Composed of a system of raagam and talam it has a rich history and tradition.

Ganga (gagana/ naaka/ moksha/ soma/Jordan/ sky) ; and, it does not refer directly to Kasi. It is called Moksha(cf.soma) Nagari in the Rg Veda, for it is believed that whosoever dies in Kasi (miina/soma/ moksha/ rusha/sura/suurya/

Therefore, Hindu believers in their old age prefer to surrender their life to God at Kasi. It is often referred to as city of temples and learning". The culture of Kasi/Varanasi/Benares is deeply associated with the river Ganga and its religious importance. The Kasi Visvanatha Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Siva. It is located in Visvanath Gali of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of
the twelve , , , (dvadasa/ Divodasa/Bhaimaseni cf.Bhiishma> bhaama-iisaana/Kasiisa/Saudeva/Sudeva/

The main deity is known by the names Srii Visvanatha and Visvesvara literally meaning Lord of the Universe(Somaskanda/
Samraaaj/Cakravartin , , ). Varanasi was
called Kasi ("shining",sikha/Siva/Soma , , , , , , ) in ancient times, and hence the temple is popularly called Kasi Visvanatha Temple.
Each of the twelve jyotirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Siva/diva. At all



these sites, the primary image is lingam(cihna/Sinha/hari/Rg

Ramesvar at Ramesvaram in Tamil Nadu and
Grishnesvar(KRshNa-grantha-iisvara; Ghrnesvara/ kiraNa/ karNa/ karuNa-lord of compassion,Siva) at Aurangabad
in Maharashtra.
The Manikarnika Ghat on the banks of Ganges near to the Kasi Visvanath Temple is considered as a Sakti PiiTha(veda
sukta/dhishNya/akshi/sakti) , , , a revered place of worship for the Saktism sect.
The Daksha(raksha/rakta/prajapti/samvatsara satra) Yaga ,
, is a Saivite story about the origin of Sakti PiiThas.



Lord Visvesara is said to be the reigning deity of Varanasi, holding the position of king(INRI) over all the other deities, as well as all over the inhabitants residing not only within the city itself, but
also within the circuit of the Panchakosi
, road (the sacred boundary of Varanasi).

Shadja (sruta/dasra/hari/hara , , , , ,
,)
Shadja (Sa)
Shadja(saras/siras/sat-sa/ja,sa-god,bird , , , snake
; ja-vishnu,man) is the first svara out of the seven svaras
of Hindustani/ Carnatic music . Shadja is the long form of the syllable Sa. Shadja is the first svara in an octave or Saptak.
Shadja is usually the first and the main svara in a raga .The svara that is played on the Tanpura for the singer is Shadja. It is played to know that one is singing on the right pitch and octave.
Shadja is the base / basic / fundamental svara in Classical music.
The svara Sa/A is also played in between ragas.The svara of Shadja is never komal or tivra, it is always Suddha in any given raga.
It is said that Shadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Shadja we get,
Shad And Ja. षड् - 6, ज -जन्म . Therefore, it means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music.



The frequency of Shadja is 240 Hz. The frequencies of the seven svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak).
Consequently, the Sa after the Ni of 450 Hz has a frequency of 480 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Sa.
There are four(turiiya/suurya/rava/deva/veda/pada) Sruti's
, , , , of Shadja. Previously the main Sruti not only for Sa but for all the other svaras was on the last Sruti but now it is considered to be on the first Sruti.
Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Suddha Svaras
Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras
Ma - Tivra Svaras
Sa is the only svara which cannot be omitted in a particular raga. Hence Sa is the most important svara in the Saptak or in any Raga.
Shadja is said to be sourced from the cry of a peacock
cf.somaskanda/sa-kaNTha , .
Shadja is associated with the planet Mercury(Budha/veda).

Hariscandra is a legendary king of the Solar dynasty(Hari/Rg), who appears in several legends in texts such as the Aitareya Brahmana, Mahabharata, the Markandeya Purana, and the Devi Bhagavata Purana. The most famous of these stories is the one mentioned in the Markandeya Purana. According to this legend, Harishchandra gave away his kingdom, sold his family, and agreed to be a slave – all to fulfill a promise he had made to the sage Visvamitra.
Aitareya Brahmana
According to a legend mentioned in Aitareya Brahamana, Hariscandra(agnishToma/Rg mantra) had one hundred wives, but no son. On advice of the sage Narada(naada/netra), he prayed to the deity Varuna for a son. Varuna granted the boon, in exchange for an assurance that Hariscandra would make a sacrifice to Varuna in the future. As a result of this boon, a son named Rohita (or Rohitasva/Rg vaca) was born to the king. After his birth, Varuna came to Hariscandra and demanded that the child be sacrificed to him. The king postponed the sacrifice multiple times citing various reasons, but finally agreed to it when Rohita became an adult. Rohita refused to be sacrificed and escaped to the forest. An angry Varuna afflicted Hariscandra with a stomach illness. Rohita intermittently visited his father, but on
the advice of Indra , never agreed to the sacrifice. Later, Rohita
managed to substitute himself with Sunahsepha in the human sacrifice. Sunahsepha prayed to the Rgvedic deities, and was saved from the sacrifice. Hariscandra's illness was also cured because of Sunahsepha's prayers; Sunahsepha was adopted by the



sage Visvamitra(Indra/Gaahi-father of Visvamitra/Kaasi/raasi)
.
A similar story is narrated in the Ramayana, but the king's name is Ambarisha instead of Hariscandra.
Credits:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harishchandra
The 12 labours/tasks of Hercules/Hera(Hari/Rg)cles(veda>paada>paaTha>piiTha>piiDha) is a close retelling of this story ! Having tried to kill Heracles ever since he was born, Hera induced a madness in him that made him kill his
wife and children(cf.Hariscandra’s wife and son). Afterwards, Heracles went to the Oracle of Delphi to atone, where he prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Heracles was told to serve Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, for ten years(dasa>10,year/ varsha,Rca cf.dasasva). During this time, he was sent to perform a series of 12 difficult feats, called labours,which are meant to tell the story of solar transit in the 12 signs of the zodiac or 12 horas of the day.
