INTRODUCTION
T
HE three lectures in this volume contain a general survey of all the Semitic calendars with special reference to the Babylonian and Assyrian menologies. Although many articles have appeared on some aspects ofthe Sumerian and Babylonian calendars, there is no book on the subject with the exception ofa very technical and learned investigation of the various month-lists of the Sumerian cities. 1 This work has not been completed and the part designed to cover the Babylonian and Assyrian Holy Year, the most important part of the subject, remains unpublished. In recent years the texts of nearly the whole of the early Assyrian Church Calendar have been published,2 and I have ready for press a critical edition of them as well as of the reformed calendar issued by Asurbanipal of Assyria in the seventh century. For the text of the latter menology I have copied all the known fragments in the British Museum together with all the fragments of the almanacs. My critical edition also includes a very large number of fragments and texts which deal with special days in each month and all the omen texts from Assur, Nineveh, and Babylonia which have to do in any way with the months and days. My Schweich Lectures are based upon thiseditionoftexts, at present almost entirely untranslated, and consequently this book is really an introduction to the philological edition. Since it will appear earlier than the edition of the texts, I have, so far as space allowed, given the reference to the sources on which the statements rest. It is obvious that with so much new material at my disposal the history and influence of the Sumerian and Babylonian calendars have been elucidated in a manner far more complete and satisfactory than was possible hereto

vi INTRODUCTION
fore. The influence of Sumerian religion and culture upon the whole history of western Asia down to our era, and continued in the Jewish calendar to our day, in the Syriac Christian calendar, and in the religious year of the ~abeans of the Middle Ages, can be traced and proved. It was natural also that with this most fortunate addition to our knowledge, placing in our hands almost a complete text which gives details of the religious and civil rules imposed upon all Babylonians and Assyrians for every day in the year, an Assyriologist should carry his investigation beyond the culture which produced it and seek to trace its influence upon J udaism, Syrian religions, and parallels if not influences in Greece and Rome. The myths of the months have particularly attracted my attention, a subject which involved arduous study of astronomical texts. Here I must at once acknowledge the valuable assistance of my learned friend, J. K. Fotheringham, D.Litt., who is now, I am glad to say, also a Fellow of our Academy. The assistance I have received from Professor D. S. Margoliouth, Professor Jeffery of Cairo, and Mr. Beeston on the early Arabic calendars has been mentioned in its proper place. My thanks are also due to Mr.J. U. Powell for assistance on the Latincalendar, and to Mr. R. McKenzie on the Greek calendar. I must apologize for the brevity ofmyinvestigations on the months Kislev, Tebit, Shebat, and Adar. The size of the volumes permitted in this series restricted the continuation of the full history of the months after Arahsamna.

LECTURE I
HISTORY OF THE SUMERIAN, ACCADIAN,
ASSYRIAN, AND WEST SEMITIC CALENDARS
I
N these lectures I do not deal in detail with the Sumerian calendars of the pre-Sargonic period except in those cases where the month-name can be definitely fixed in the series or can be used to throw light upon the monthly festivals of the Nippurian calendar, whose series is certain. My object in these lectures has been to trace the myths and festivals of the Nippurian calendar which finally prevailed over all other Sumerian, Accadian, Assyrian, and West Semitic calendars, and became the monthly series of the Jewish Church. The great menologies of Assyria which were promulgated about 1ooo B.c. and are clearly copies from Babylonian originals reveal traces of the myths of the old Sumerian months. To understand the rules and myths of the Babylonian and Assyrian menologies, which finally issued in the form of the great series enbu bel ar!Jim, 'The fruit, lord of the month', promulgated by ASurbanipal in the seventh century (on the basis ofBabylonian originals) in fifteen tablets (twelve months and three intercalary months), it is necessary to study first of all the Sumerian calendar of Nippur on which they are based. The myths of the Sumerian months gave rise to the association of certain constellations, principally signs of the zodiac, with those myths, and in principle those constellations, which rose heliacally at the time of the monthly festivals, are those which became associated with the months. It is obvious that the process of discovering figures in the constellations to suit the monthly myths began as early as 3000 B.c., that is, when Taurus and the Pleiades were rising heliacally soon after the spring equinox. If it can be proved that the stars of this constellation are woven into the myth and festival of the first Sumerian month it proves that the
B



2 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
Sumerians connected the myth with that constellation when it was rising heliacally in the first month. It follows presumably that the other signs of the zodiac, if they were discovered in the early Taurus period, correspond to months in each case one month earlier than in the Aries period, when Aries was rising in the first month, that is after 500 B.c. (A date anywhere between I Ioo-soo B.c. can be assumed for the beginning of the Aries period.) In the discussion of the monthly festivals and legends connected with each month I have presumed an ideal year beginning with the rising of Pleiades and Aldebaran in Taurus in the month Barazaggar of the Nippurian calendar, that is Nisan of the Babylonian. For the Aries period there are several sources (not always in agreement), which give the decans or three principal stars governing each month after about I 100 B.c. The following table, obtained by combining the various sources, is used throughout my discussion. As a general principle, to ascertain the stars and constellations rising in a month 3000-2000 B.c., when the myths of the months were associated with them, it is necessary to shift the entries for any given month one place earlier. For example, the decans of Ayar after uoo B.c. would be those of Nisan in the Sumerian period 3000 to 2300 B.c. when the calendars, feasts, and myths were finally fixed. I use as a basis the Astrolabe Pinches. I This is controlled by Thureau-Dangin, Uruk, 14 Obv. 14-19, which gives the twelve regents of the ba-la (divisions) of the path of the sun and moon.

It was reproduced by Kugler, Sternkunde, I 229-30 and Ergiin;:ungen, 20I with identifications of each decan with stars ofAccad, Elam, and Amurru; Kugler omits the figures after each decan, but Weidner, Handbuch, 65-6, reproduced Pinches' copy with figures. For Weidner's explanation of the figures see my
Epic of Creation, I53; for Fotheringham's theory see ibid. I54· The same figures occur on the fragmentary astrolabes, CT. 33, I I-I2.

I6r. Both names are late and have no reference to the word Aries, ram. Also lu-KU-MAL = agrum, CT. 41,49 Rev. 7; from the glosses, ibid. 4 and 7, the reading is gu-un-ga(r); the Sumerians named this constellation 'The Hireling', labourer for some unknown reason. The Babylonians did not see a ram in this constellation. SeeJeremias, A.G. 214. In the Taurus period this constellation governed Adar. And in Adar sacrifices
to Ea and the Ea cult are prominent. Langdon, Archives of Drehem, No. 49; Genouillac, Trouvaille, 77· Therefore 'The Hireling' and 'Canal Star' were connected with Ea. But one of the symbols of Ea is the ram, Langdon, Sem. Myth. ro6 at top. In view of the fact that the other constellations are all of Babylonian origin it is curious that this is the only evidence that they knew the sign as Aries. Aries as the star gunga is Tammuz, CT. 33, 2, 43; lit gunga, regent of Nisan, Thureau-Dangin, Uruk, 14, 14; 12 Rev. section 8.

A 6, 1, Nidaba mul kit-ha, 'the holy star', hence the Sumerians already knew this constellation as 'corn-goddess', rising in time ofGudea at the beginning of Elul.

Since the New year festival of Teshrit is based upon the myth of the judgement of souls, and this myth was connected with the scales, Libra, it is impossible to place the origin of this myth earlier than about 2000 B.c., when Libra would be rising toward the beginning of Teshrit. In other words the myth ofjudgement at New Year in Teshrit must be much later than the same myth ofNisan, connected with Taurus. For purposes of mythology and monthly festivals the stars of Teshrit here cannot be put back into Elul as regents of the sixth month in the Taurus period. 1 Note that Libra is the star of Nippur, seat of the Enlil cult (Thureau-Dangin, Uruk, 12 Reverse).

[ul zib(ba-ti), Star of the tails of the Fish.]S A striking aspect of Sumero-Babylonian religion is the association ofmyths with each ofthe months and the attempt to find in the regnal constellations of the months figures which correspond to the ideas involved in the monthly myths. The monthly festivals were based upon these myths, which together with the festivals originated in the Sumerian period between 3000-2000 B.C. The Sumerians devised lunar calendars in each of their great cities which can be traced in most cases to about 3000 B.c. The lunar calendar with its system of intercalating a month originally before the twelfth month, !egurkud, barley harvest, to keep the season of harvest in its place, was never abandoned throughout the entire history of the Sumerians, Babylonians, andAssyrians.6 It was still in use right down to the Christian era, when this mighty civilization perished under the rule of Parthia. The lunar calendar is based upon the period from the

ASTRONOMICAL LENGTH OF THE MONTH I I
moon's first appearance after sunset to its disappearance on the morning of the 28th day. Babylonian astronomers of the sixth century B.c. had arrived at an almost accurate calculation of the length of the lunar month, 29 days, 44 minutes, 3! seconds.1 Modern astronomy cannot improve upon this result for the period 6oo-1oo B.C. Hipparchus of Nicaea in Asia Minor, one of the founders of Greek astronomy (middle ofsecond century B.c.), and all his successors to Ptolemaeus of Alexandria in the second century A.D. based their studies upon the work of Babylonian astronomers of Erech, Barsippa, and Babylon. Geminus of Rhodes in his ElaayooyT] els TcX cpatv61leva, Introduction to Celestial Phenomena, written in the time of Christ, named the Chaldeans as discoverers of the exact motions of the moon. Such precise calculations ofthe lunar month were the result ofmore than 2,ooo years of observation and continuous records. Here in our northern hemisphere there is an unbroken history of the religious calendars and monthly myths from the Sumerian calendars of 3000 B.c. through Babylonia, Judea, and Christianity to our own times. I shall now trace the history of the various Semitic calendars of Babylonia Assyria, Aramaea, Canaan, Phoenicia, andJudaea and show how this medley of Semitic calendars was finally displaced by the Nippurian calendar; how all these Semitic peoples abandoned their native calendars and only the translations of the Sumerian month-names, the Sumerian myths and festivals survived and determined the character of the church calendar of Babylonia and Assyria, which in turn gave Judaism its series of fixed festivals. The myths of the months, the festivals based upon them, their survival in Judaism, their parallels in Greece and Rome; these are the principal subjects which I discuss in this volume, serving as an introduction to my edition of the Old Assyrian, New Assyrian, and Babylonian calendars. Here were combined the legends of the constellations with the legends of the

seasons in remarkable manner. They had no Ovid to rehearse the tales of the months, but the opening lines of the Fasti describe precisely what the Babylonian and Assyrian church calendars really are:
The times in order through the Latin year Together with their causes, And the starry signs that set beneath the earth And rise again may I sing.
In Babylonian literature there is only one attempt to do for the calendar what Ovid did for the first six Latin months. It is only a fragment from a large tablet in the British Museum, written about the time ofNebuchadnezzar. Here a scribe rehearsed the legends of the twelve months. In the second month (Ayar) Bel (Marduk) conquered the dragon of chaos. In the third month Sivan (May-June) Bel decided to destroymankindin the deluge. In the fourth month,Tammuz (June-July), is recorded an astrological omen which occurred in a remote age and foretold the destruction of Babylon by the Elamites. The commentary on Tammuz gives the valuable information that Perseus and the Pleiades were the hypsoma of the Moon; Aries of the Sun; [Capricorn] ofMars; [Cancer] ofjupiter. Here the scribe indicated the points in the ecliptic where the planets have the most potent effect (hypsoma) upon the lives of men, and the same astrological system passed into Greek astrology. In the tenth month Tebit (Dec.-Jan.) is recorded the legend that Tiamat, dragon of chaos, rules the constellation Capricorn. It was the sign in the zodiac that governed rituals against demons in the dark days ofJanuary when ghosts rose from hell and when men were put to the ordeal to test their guilt.

When the first South Arabic invasion reached that classic soil some time before 3000 B.C. they found the various Sumerian cities each using different

EARLY ACCADIAN MONTH-NAMES 13
calendars for the twelve lunar months. These illiterate Semites, like the Canaanites, Hebrews, and Phoenicians, had their own names for the twelve months of the year. Eleven ofthese month-names have survived; these invaders, who are the earliest Semitic people known to us, had no writing of their own and borrowed the Sumerian cuneiform script, religion, and calendars and adopted the Sumerian religious year. They wrote the names of the months according to the calendar of the Sumerian city where they happened to be transacting their business. 1 But when the first important documents of the Semites appear in the time of the Empire of Agade it is evident that the calendar of the Sumerians at Nippur had already been adopted as the usual one.2 The primitive names for months among the earliest Semites of Babylonia have no similarity whatsoever to those which have survived in South Arabic inscriptions. TheAccadian month-names known from texts ofthe Agade period are: (1) bu-un-ti, (2) !a-ni-i, (3) ~a-bit-tum, (4) ba-ni-i,

These names have no connexion with the South Arabic month-names which have been compiled for me by Mr. A. F. L. Beeston, B.A., of Christ Church, Oxford. In the following alphabetically arranged list I have marked Sabaean names with S, Minaean with M, and Qatabanian with Q.4

All months marked 'former' and 'latter' are of course intercalary. It is obvious that the early Semites (Accadians), wherever be their origin, agree with the SouthArabic peoples in using an intercalary month to keep the names to their seasons. All later Arabic calendars are strictly lunar and the names fall eleven days later each year and in thirty-three years each month passes through the entire solar year. Insuch a system agricultural names ofmonths and association ofmonthswith fixed stars are impossible. But in Accadian there is already

ACCADIANS ADOPT SUMERIAN CALENDAR I 7
The importance of these month-names is that they represent the oldest known Semitic calendar and come from that prehistoric Semitic people whose language fixed for ever the vocabulary and grammar of the later Babylonian and Assyrian peoples. The church calendar of Babylonia and Assyria, which had such profound influence upon the Jewish, Aramaic, and Phoenician calendars, the primitive Accadians did not originate. Almost immediately after their arrival in Mesopotamia they began to abandon their own Semitic months in favour of the church calendars of the Sumerians. Sargon united the Sumerian and Accadian peoples into a military empire which ruled from Persia to Phoenicia, from Anatolia to the southern sea; in this Semitic empire the Sumerian calendar of Nippur became the normal rule for the months and the monthly festivals. The religious calendar of a people usually maintains itself tenaciously through all vicissitudes; the conquering Semites of Accad threw aside the calendar which they had inherited from their prehistoric home because in Mesopotamia they found an advanced Sumerian civilization whose great religion was based upon a church calendar. To adopt that religion meant to adopt the monthly festivals; it meant to lay aside every one of the primitive names for the months in favour of mythological and cult names; it meant the acceptance ofa church calendar based upon monthly feasts of mythological and astronomical character. Here soon after 3000 B.c. began that revolution of Semitic religion which profoundly influenced the Semitic races of Western Asia. The Sumerian church calendar, which connected each month with some theological myth, with some constellation in heaven woven into the monthly festival, finally passed beyond the borders

18 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
of Mesopotamia. Backed by its almost universal adoption in business transactions in the wide empires of Assyria and Babylonia, by the elaborate manner in which the Assyrians wrote the menologies with instructions for each day of the year, it completely supplanted the old Hebrew calendar after the Second Captivity; it spread in the Aramaic lands of Syria and Nabataea and displaced the agricultural calendars of Canaan and Phoenicia. The Accadians had adopted the calendar of Nippur, the seat of the greatest of all Sumerian cults. Nippur was the seat of the Earth-god and his pantheon; it was a centre of learning from early times, where theological poems, chronological records, text-'Qooks on philology and syntax were written. The views of the Nippurian schoolmen prevailed in most Sumerian capitals and their works were edited with Semitic translations, especially their liturgical books, becoming the canonical liturgies of the Babylonian and Assyrian temples. It cannot surprise, then, that their views about the myths of the months and their religious calendar prevailed in every Sumerian capital and finally displaced every known Semitic calendar in Western Asia, save in Arabia. It seems clear that the fixed Jewish festivals were taken directly from the great menologies and almanacs ofBabylonia and Assyria, which in turn go back directly to the Sumerians ofNippur. The calendar is the framework of any civilization, the time index for all business transactions and religious observances, the rule by which all daily life is regulated. Therefore, with the universal adoption of the Nippurian months the unlettered Semite of Babylonia found it necessary to have translations of these twelve month-names into his own Accadian speech. With the Amorite invasion of Sumer and Accad about 2300 B.c. the Accadians introduced a set of twelve names of the months which are translations of the Nippurian series. Although the scribes almost invariably wrote the Sumerian names in all documents the ordinary Semite learned the Accadian rendering. It is these translations which prevailed in western Asia, namely, Nisan, Ayar,



ACCADIAN TRANSLATIONS FOR SUMERIAN MONTHS 19
Sivan, Tammuz,Ab,Elul, Teshrit,Arahsamna,Kislev, Tebit, Shebat, Adar. These were the names used by the Aramaeans and Hebrews in the late period, and are still the names used by Jews to this day. There is no evidence that the NisanAdar month-names were ever a real Semitic list or were ever used by any Semitic people originally. 1 The meanings of the words borrowed by the Jews were almost entirely unknown to them. When the Semites of Babylonia adopted the name Du'uzi for the fourth month (July), that was due entirely to the fact that the Sumerians celebrated the death ofTammuz in that month. No Semitic race had ever possessed a cult of the dying Tammuz, god of pastures and flocks, who perished in the summer sun. In the Sumerian calendar of Ur this month was known as the 'Feast of the breaking ofbread for the god Ninazu', another name for Tammuz. In the second month, Ayar or April, Tammuz had married the virgin goddess Ishtar; in the fourth month he died and descended into hell, and the Sumerians broke bread at the funeral feast for the dead god. This was the myth of June in every Sumerian city. In July, or month of Ab, there were burning of torches and festivals for the dead god. In the sixth month there was the purification of Ishtar at Nippur, a festival for Tammuz at Lagash and Ur, rendered Elulu, 'the purification', by the Semites. The months Tammuz, Ab, Elul-or June, July, August-formed a great cycle of the cult of the dying god and his mother the virgin Ishtar. How then did the Semites obtain the names for these months, Tammuz, Ab, Elul? Did they inherit them from a primitive Semitic race of shepherds and farmers who invaded Mesopotamia from Syria and Canaan and founded the Amoritic kingdoms of Babylonia and Assyria in the twenty-fourth century? That is wholly incredible in view of the fact that these names
1 It may be objected here that certain of these names are written phonetically in the First Dynasty, A-ia-rum, Abi, Abum (at Susa), Elulu, Elunum, Adaru, Adari (at Susa). These are only the current renderings of the Sumerian calendar.



20 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
precisely express some salient feature of the Sumerian myths and cults in those months. Let us take for example the name of the fifth Jewish month Ab, I borrowed from the Babylonian Abu. Obviously the Talmudic scholars did not know what this word meant. Now the name ofthis month at Lagash, one ofthe Sumerian capitals, was 'Feast of the eating of millet' in honour of the god Ningirsu, a local name for Tammuz. At Ur it was called the 'Feast ofNinazu', the name ofTammuz while he slept in the lower world; at Nippur it was known as the 'Month oftorches' (izi-izi-gar). 2 The Babylonians rendered the name in the Nippurian calendar by 'month of the festival of the abu', and apu, abu is the Babylonian word for firewood, torch. The rituals of this month, therefore, consisted in eating bread in the funeral feasts for the dead god of life, who now reposed in hell, and in carrying torches by night for the souls of the dead. A Sumerian and Babylonian commentary explains the cult and myth of this month: 'Ab is the month ofSirius and the god Ninurta. Fire-brands are lighted, and there is burning of torches for the souls of the dead. The fire-god descends from heaven. The heroes in the courts of the nether world ascend by the gates on the ninth day.'3 Torches lit the way of the souls of the dead who ascended on thenightofthegth ofAb. The Sun-god, who had reached his zenith at the summer solstice in the preceding month Tammuz, now begins his long decline toward the winter solstice, and the myth runs that the god of the burning fire now begins his descent from heaven. The burning torches also signified the declining sun of the summer solstice, and in his decline the Sun-god was known as Nergal, 'Lord of the vast city of the dead'. The constellation Corvus which rose in this month at gooo B.c. was identified with Nergal,4 god of the burning July sun (seep. 5 sub Elul). 1 Ab does not occur in the Hebrew and Aramaic of the Old Testament, but is first recorded in the Aramaic Papyri of Egypt in the fifth century B.c., Cowley, Aramaic Papyri, No. I4, I. 2 See i-zi-ga-ri = #paru, torch, RA. XI I46, 36. 3 KAV. 2 I8, p. I I9 11 I-I6; Weidner, HB. 86. 4 CT. 26, 42 11 I4.



CEREMONIES OF THE MONTH AB 2I
On the I sth of Ab there was a Jewish festival, which Josephus says was the festival of the wood-bearers, who brought fuel for the altar 'that a supply might never fail; for it remains eternally unquenched'. In the ordinances promulgated by Nehemiah, in the time of Artaxerxes I, for the restoration ofJewish religion after the Exile, it is written: 'And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites and the people for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our god to burn upon the altar of Yav our god as it is written in the Law.' To supply wood for the eternal fire of the altar was undoubtedly an ancient custom revived by Nehemiah.1 This emphasis upon the month ofAb as the time for supplying the eternal fire of the altar is in fact not mentioned in the laws of the ancient Hebrews. Is it an ancient Canaanite ritual, or is it based upon the midsummer fires of the same month of the Sumerian, Babylonian, and Assyrian calendars? Obviously the Jews in exile in Babylonia knew the calendars of the temples there; they knew the myths of the months. So effective was the influence of Babylonia upon them that they abandoned their own names for the months and accepted the Babylonian names. But the church calendars of Babylonia and Assyria had preserved the Sumerian ordinances of a remote past. The myth and cult of each great monthly festival were indicated in most cases by the name of the month. Ab was the festival of burning fires for

22 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
the midsummer sun, and the word itself conveyed this sense. Had this myth and ritual spread to the Semitic peoples of the West long before Nehemiah? When the Jews borrowed the word Ab for the fifth month they must have known what the word meant. Somehow this knowledge was never passed on to their descendants. This same festival of the midsummer fires, the a~ara, survives amongtheMohammedans ofNorthMrica, where they celebrate it on the 24th of June with bonfires. The festival passed into Spain and survived as St. John's Day on the 24th ofJune. Here in Europe this pagan myth is also known as St. John's Day on the 23rd of June. All this goes back to the festal fires of the remote antiquity. They were for some reason attached to the myth of John the Baptist in the Christian calendar, and in one way or another to the greatmythofTammuz, the god who was slain by the summer heat; and in Sardinia to this day the ritual of the Adonis gardens is incorporated into the festival of St. John's Day. The ninth of Ab1 in the Assyrian calendar is marked as the day when the souls of dead men are released from their confinement in the nether world. Their prison gates were opened and they returned to share the mournful parentalia with the living on earth. But Ab the ninth is the great day of lamentation in the Jewish calendar. On this day was sung the Book of Lamentations, and a special book of dirges has been written for it, a day of wailing in remembrance of Jewish calamities. This day was instituted in the Rabbinic period and is continued to our own times; it was explained as a day of remembrance for the Fall of Jerusalem at the hands ofNebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C. and for its destruction by Titus A.D. 70. The Hebrew records in the Book of the Kings placed the fall ofJerusalem on the 7th ofAb;Jeremiah says that it took place on the Ioth. The later Jewish choice of Ab the ninth seems to have been taken directly from the Assyrian and Babylonian calendars.2

CANAANITE MONTH-NAMES 23
I have chosen the name of the fifth month Ab as an illustration to prove that the names of the twelve months which the Babylonians introduced with the Amorite invasion of Mesopotamia in the twenty-fourth century are surely mere attempts to reproduce some salient feature of the Sumerian festivals for each month, or to give their idea of what the names in the Sumerian calendars meant. It serves to show how the dates of many Jewish festivals were fixed after the Exile. By the universal adoption ofthe Babylonian month-names in Syria, Judaea, and all Aramaic lands the dates of the fixed festivals also became known. In the twenty-fourth century came then the second great wave of Semitic invasion into Babylonia which resulted in the founding of the First Babylonian Dynasty. At the same time this invasion spread to the northern lands of the old Empire of Agade and resulted in the founding of Assyria. This is known as the invasion of the Amorites, which means nothing linguistically. They are held to be Arabians, Canaanites, or Aramaeans. Had they been Canaanites surely some ancient Canaanite month-names would have been introduced into the Accadian language. Most of the Canaanite month-names are known. Four have survived in the Hebrew records: Ahib, .(_iv, Etiinim, and Bul. In the reformed calendar, which shifted the beginning of the Canaanite year from the autumn to the spring, Ahih became the first month since Passover occurred in it,I a feast dated Nisan 14th in the new Jewish-Babylonian system.2 .(_iv is the second month.J Etiinzm4 the seventh month, originally first month, belongs also to the Phoenician calendar. Bul is the eighth month, originally second,s and is also Phoenician. These are all agricultural names; Ahib, month of the

24 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
ripe ears of corn, April, and Bul, probably the same as Accadian hUlu, cattle, are clearly of agricultural origin. The original calendar began in the autumn and was regulated bythe ingatheringoffruits, the 'as£ph. 1 All these names were supplanted in the Exilic period by the Babylonian equivalents, Nisan for Abib, Ayar for Ziv, Teshrit for Etanim and Arahsamna for Bul. The old Canaanite series began with the 'as£ph and Abib was the seventh month. Out of this confusion caused by renumbering the months (after the Babylonian series) arose the Jewish custom of distinguishing between the ecclesiastical year beginning with Nisan, and the civil year beginning with Teshri. The civil year is really a survival of the original year which obtained among all Canaanitish peoples, Hebrews, Phoenicians, Moabites, and Edomites.z A stone slab inscribed with a list of Canaanite months was discovered at Gezer, but it is uncertain whether it is intended to be a real calendar or merely a promiscuous list of the agricultural activities of the year.J According to Dalman's arrangement the list runs from October to July with omission of two months. The latest interpretation is given in the following table.
r. 'osep, ingathering, October.
2. zera:, sowing, December. 3· Ulfe!, late sowing, February.4
4· •t¥ad pe!et, harvesting of flax, March.s

The {Jag ha 'iisiph, was preserved as the name of the seventh month (Teshri) under the form Ag <{Jag in the GreekSyrian calendar of Heliopolis (Ba'albek), Benfey, Monatsnamen, 21-2; 177. See 'Tabernacles', in Cheyne's Encyclopaedia Biblica; fixed in postexilic times Teshri 15-21. :z Charles Virolleaud writes me that the early Phoenicians at Ras Shamra had no names for the months but simply numbered them 1, 2, 3, &c. On this point judgement must be suspended until these early Phoenician texts are fully studied.

The order of the ten Phoenician months has not been fixed with the exception of three which occur in Hebrew. The list is:

These lists contain all the known primitive West Semitic months. As to Aramaic only one name has survived which can be defined as early. At Palmyra, where the Babylonian names were employed, curiously Arahsamna,'eighth month', does not appear; for this month the original Aramaic Kinuns was retained probably because Arahsamna was only a numerical notation and conveyed no cult meaning. Kinun, however, is the only supposedly West Semitic name found in the Babylonian calendar, and if so was obviously imported with the Amorite invasion.

HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
The Pre-Islamic calendar1 has been compiled for me by Professors D. S. Margoliouth and Arthur Jeffery (Cairo):
I. Mu'tamir, month of one that seeks advice.2 Also mamir. 2. Najir, hot month. 3· /jawwan, perfidious.
4· B~~an, b~an, wab~an, wub~an.
5· $£ban, cold and cloudy. Also lfan£n, yearning desire. 6. Mal~an, month of cold and snow. Also Runna. 7. Al-A~amm, the deaf.
8. wa·iz, mountain goat. g. Nati~, that which yields fire. IO. ·Adhil, month of him that reproves. I I. Huwa·. Also Warnat, female chameleon. I2. Burak, that which remains fixed.
Another pre-Islamic list from the same sources is:
I. Mujib, making necessary, obligatory. 2. Mujaz, summarily composed, epitome. 3· Maurid, way to water. 4· Malzaj, from lazij, be elastic, meaning? 5· M~dar, flowing, source?, or lion, wolf? 6. Haubar. Panther.
7· M-w-y-l, mau'il, refuge. 8. Mauhib, gift, favour. I o. Jaifal, from jafal, be swift. I I. M-~-l-s, continuous travel.

AMORITE INVASION OF BABYLONIA 27
calendars are usually of mythological origin they are nonSemitic, that is of Sumerian origin. Not one of the Babylonian names of the months in the regular calendar is traceable to any Semitic source; they are in fact only translations of the Sumerian month-names. The second Semitic invasion ofMesopotamia, c. 2300 B.c., almost certainly came from the home-land ofthe Aramaeans in Syria. The invaders founded the dynasties of Babylonia and Assyria. Founded upon the ruins of the Accadian and Sumerian kingdoms, adopting the Accadian language and accepting fully, as their Semitic predecessors had done, the Sumerian religion and calendar, the new ruling class directed the destinies of Western Asia from Babylon, Assur, and Nineveh until the time of Cyrus. The Sumerian religious year followed in the wake of their conquests and spread over Western Asia precisely as the Roman calendar spread into all parts of the Roman Empire. Problems ofprofound historical import are involved here. Who were these new founders of empires at Babylon and Assur? What part did the Habiri or Hebrews play in this vast upheaval in Semitic lands? Three views are strenuously defended. (a) The Amorites were Canaanites and the Habiri entered Mesopotamia with them. If this were true, why has no single trace of their month-names survived in their vast literature? (b) They were a North Arabic people. If so, the same objection can be raised. It is true that we know next to nothing aboutNorthArabic until after the Christian period. Pre-Mohammedan month-names are not those of Islam. (c) The Amorites came from Syria and were Aramaeans. From the wide steppes of the upper Euphrates, from the Lebanons and the plains of the north they poured into Assyria, Sumer, and Accad. They, of course, had names for the months, but the early history of the Aramaic peoples from 2300 to Boo B.C. is a total blank in our records. We know that the name of their eighth month was kiniin or



28 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
kanun, the month of the hearth-fires. But this is the only West Semitic month which appears in Babylonia in the records of the Amoritic kingdom of Sumu-abu, Hammurabi-Amraphel, and Samsuditana. Nothing could prove more clearly that the Amoritic kingdoms of Isin and BabyIon and of Assyria really are not Canaanite or Arabic but Aramaic. 1
The following Semitic names of months appear in the times of the Amoritic dynasty at Babylon, although they ordinarily used the Nippur calendar or Semitic renderings of it. Since the Semitic language current in Babylonia and Assyria at the time of the Amoritic or Aramaic invasion was Accadian, the ruling Aramaic class adopted that language, and consequently the Semitic renderings of the Nippur month-names, Nisan, Ayar, &c., are in Accadian. However, a few of their own native month-names do occur under Accadian forms. I assume that the Aramaic year began with the autumn equinox as does the Canaanite list of months at Gezer. Consequently one of the Aramaic names is SibUtu, seventh month, reckoning from Teshrit; it must also have begun in the winter, December or Kislev; for SibUtu is not only Nisan but also Sivan, i.e. first and third months (reckoning from the spring calendar).2 When Sibutu was used in the Susa calendar (see below) for the seventh month that can mean only the numerical order after the adoption of a spring calendar by the Accadians of Elam and has no connexion with its use by the Amoritic inhabitants of Babylonia. The use of this name in Babylonia, in my opinion, proves that they, i.e. the Aramaeans, normally regarded Teshrit as the first month, i.e. September, and consequently they rendered the Sumerian name for
1 This is also the conclusion of Julius Lewy on phonetic grounds. For the defence of the Canaanite character ofthe Amorite kingdoms see Theo Bauer, Ostkanaanlier; literature ibid. p. x, n. 2. The force of this argument depends upon the theory that kimun is of Aramaic origin. A Sumerian origin is, however, possible; see pp. 133-5. z See p. x6, n. 3·



ACCADIAN MONTH-NAMES IN BABYLONIA 29
this month which follows the equinox (i.e. du-kug) not by any word to seize the salient feature of the myth and cult but by a word meaning 'beginning, opening of the year', i.e. tesr£tu. Since the verb seru, to begin, is extremely common in Aramaic it is not improbable that the Syriac Tesr£tti, October-November, really belongs to the original Aramaic list and is not simply a loan-word from Babylonian tesr£tu. In other words tesr£tti may have been identified with du-kug, and is not an Accadian rendering. Beside SibUtu and TesrZtu the following list of Semitic month-names occurring in the Hammurabi period may be
g~ven.
(a) ara!J sa-an-du-tim,1 explained as equal to harvest time, hence March or April. Also sa-du-tim,2 sa-ad-du-tim,3 ina sandutim is used simply for 'at harvest'.4 This name may be a survival from the Agade period like !Jumtu and t£ru. The word is derived from sadtidu, which seems to mean 'reap'. (h) ara!J ki-nu-ni,s ara!J ki-nu-nu.6 This may be an Aramaic month-name brought by the Amorites into Babylonia and Assyria. It occurs in the early Assyrian calendar at Nuzi, ara!J gi-nu-nu sa al ilani, 'month of the ginunu of the city of the gods', probably referring to the sacred hearth-fire at the capital Assur.7 At Hana on the middle Euphrates and in the centre of the Aramaic lands the occurrence of ara!J ki-nu-nimB is significant. The Palmyrene kinun or kanun replaces Arahsamna in that Aramaic calendar and is known to be the equivalent of the Greek b-ios (eighth month).9 The Syriac name is Kanon, December, and the latter Kanon, January. For rituals of the kinunu, brazier, hearth-fire, see Arahsamna, Kislev, and Tebit, in Chapter Ill.

EARLY ASSYRIAN MONTH-NAMES 31
EARLY ASSYRIAN AND CAPPADOCIAN MONTHS1
Aramaic names were almost completely suppressed by Sumerian culture when the Amorites conquered Babylonia. Here they were in much closer contact with the Sumerian people than in the northern kingdom at Assur, where they must have gained supremacy about the same time. Therefore, if any primitive Semitic calendar had a chance of resisting, at least for a time, the increasing influence of the ancient Sumerian calendar it was in the early history of Assyria. Fortunately this Aramaic version of the calendar has been preserved not only in numerous contracts but in official lists.2 According to the local Assyrian lists, which were also used in Cappadocia in the twenty-second century, the year began with arab ~amiti; that is Adar or March. It is, therefore, doubtful whether this is any longer a pure Semitic calendar, and several of the names in it show the influence of the myths of the corresponding Sumerian calendar. (I 2) I. arab ~ar-ra-a-ti, month of cold ( ?) , describing March in northern Mesopotamia, probably a primitive Aramaic name for March-April.3

32 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
(1) 2. ara!J tan-mar-te, month ofheliacal rising (ofPleiades). This name was applied to the month March-April by the early Assyrians as a description of the first month in the Nippurian calendar as adopted by their own people in the south. tanmarte is explained as equivalent to the first Nippurian month itiBara-zag-gar. 1 As will be seen from the myth of the month Barazaggar in Chapter 11 the Sumerian name means 'month of him that sits in the holy chamber', referring to the assembly of the gods when Enlil sat before them in the cosmic chamber and decreed fates for the New Year. This was associated with the rising ofTaurus and the Pleiades. Hence the Semites of the north rendered Barazaggar by the astronomical aspect of the myth, whereas in the south the Babylonians rendered it by Nisannu, 'first month'.2 Sennacherib as late as the seventh century preserves a record of the meaning of tanmartu as used by his early ancestors. Recording his reconstruction of the hzt akiti, house of the New Year's festival at Assur, he has written: 'In the month bar-sag-sag, the first month, (month) of the father Enlil, month of the appearance (na-an-mur-ti) of the Plough Star, festival of the banquet3 of the king of the gods Ashur.'4

EARLY ASSYRIAN MONTH-NAMES 33
It is certain that the Sumerian myth had been attached to Tanmartu in the early Assyrian calendar; Sennacherib goes on to say that this ceremony had been neglected since ancient days,I which apparently proves that the word tanmartu was actually used to describe the month Barazaggar. The Plough Star has been identified with Triangulum above and Arietis,2 but it certainly included Pleiades; for it is indicated by seven stars,J and was assigned to Enlil, since this god summoned the assembly when the Pleiades rose in the Taurus period.4 Tanmartu, therefore, is no primitive Aramaic-Accadian name, but a word applied to the first month under Sumerian influence.

The myth of this month should be taken from the sixth Nippurian month kin- d.Jnnini, month of the mission oflshtar, rendered Elulu, month ofthe washing, by the Babylonians.1 The Babylonians, rendering the salient aspect of ceremonies of the sixth Sumerian month by elulu, washing, based their translation on a myth of the bathing of Ishtar and not on the real meaning ofkin- d.Jnnini, 'mission of Ishtar',2 which almost certainly refers to the descent oflshtar into the lower world to seek for Tammuz,l a myth celebrated in the sixth month. The sixth month Elul was sacred to Ishtar,4 and the Tammuz myth must have figured in the ceremonies of this month, for it was known as the month of the 'festival ofTammuz' among the Sumerians ofLagash.s The Assyrians designated this month byanameofthe goddess lshtar6 as queen in the lower world and is probably taken from a myth of the 'mission of Ishtar' in the Nippurian calendar.

corresponds to te!ritu, 'beginning' (ofthe autumn year), one is attracted by the possibility that saratu represents the Aramaic !arjutha, !arwaja, 'beginning', month of the beginning, first month of the old West Semitic year, and that the Assyrians only chose another derivative of the common Semitic verb !a-r-w, Ethiopic s-r-j, to express this meaning.1

Rituals with the kinunu occur in the menologies for this month.2 No myth has survived concerning the eighth month in Sumer and Babylonia, and it is curious that not Arahsamna but Teshrit, the seventh month, is described as the month !a kinati,3 and in two lists !a kinati is made equivalent to Teshrit.4 If the order of months accepted here is correct, and the mythology of the other months indicates that it is so, then the 'ceremonies of the families', or parentalia for the souls of the dead, occurred in Arahsamna in Assyria, not in Teshrit as in Babylonia.

The ceremony characteristic of this month, December, is the carrying torches and lights,1 and sacrifices to the gods of the lower world. In the Susa calendar the ninth month is called ara!J tam-!Ji-ri. tam!Jiru and mu!Jur must have the same meaning and probably 'reception', month of the reception of the gods. The mythology is obscure but in some way refers to the resurrection of the Sun-god Nergal at the winter solstice, when the god of vegetation returns from the lower world and is again received with rejoicing by the gods of earth and sky.z
(g) 10. ara!J a-bu samini, month of the father of kings, corresponding to Tebit in Babylonia, January. The month was known as 'the famous festival of Anu',J and Anu bestowed kingship upon men.4 The name is, therefore, taken from Sumerian mythology and from the name of this month at Ur, ezen-an-na, month of the festival of heaven, or of the heaven-god. In this month the elders of the cities who had died ascended from the lower world, at Nippur called ezen ab-e-ka, 'festival of the ascent of the elders'. By 'elders's the myth probably includes 'kings'. The Assyrians, therefore, obtained this name from the myth that this month was sacred to Anu, the heaven-god and father of kings.6 In the Susa calendar the name sililitu for this month remains obscure.7 The mythology proves that this is the tenth month, not the ninth.

Shebat was the month of demons in Jewish mythology and an Assyrian menology has the entry for Shebat 3oth: 'On the thirtieth let him bow to Adad; wine he shall not drink; in the river the ~£dtinu will not seize him.'2 To utter an imprecation against a ghost is to say 'May he cross the Hubur river',3 and the ship which crosses it reaches the quay of death.4 'Thou shalt cross the Hubur river', addressed to the demoness of plague, was said to be an ancient saying.s The demoness Lamashtu is cursed and sent across the Hubur river in a boat.6 The demon conducts men to the Hubur river, meaning that they are led to death,7 and Nergal, lord of the dead, is 'king of the Hubur',s the world-encircling stream, the bitter sea, over which first brooded Tiamat, dragon of Chaos.9 Gilgamish had crossed the Hubur river10 and a prayer to Tammuz, who yearly descended to Arallu, reads, 'When thou crossest the iju-bur curse him (the demon) in the name of Ea.'n The belief in the danger from demons in the eleventh month, Shebat, February, reveals itself in ara!J !Juldubbe, month when demons were expelled, of the Susa calendar.

EARLY ASSYRIAN MONTH-NAMES 39
The Babylonians found no mythology of this kind in the Sumerian calendar, for they rendered the month by !abafu, month ofstorms, describing the rainy season, and the Nippur Sumerian calendar describes it as 'month of emmer'. At Ur it was called month of the festival of the god Mekigal, rendered by ezen d.Adad, 'feast of the storm-god',I and the month was sacred to Adad. If the Semites of Elam and Assyria found a reason for designating this month as a time of danger from demons, in Sumerian the source has been found for the ninth month of the Ur calendar, or tenth (towards the end of the last Ur dynasty). In tablets dated by ezen-mag there are offerings to the ki-ljabur,2 in the temple ofAdad, that is to the 'place of the river of the lower world'. The goddess of this river of death, ljuburitum, was worshipped in the ninth (tenth) monthl and there was a ritual known as nabrium to the goddesses of the lower world, Allatum, Belat-subnir, Belat-dabbaran in the ninth month of the Ur calendar.4 For arab Jjibur = Kislev, ninth month, see below, p. 40.
(11) 12. arab ~ip-pi, month of orchards.s In this early Assyrian list which begins the year with a month corresponding to Adar, the twelfth month of the Babylonian calendar, most of the names are taken from the mythology of the Sumerian calendars. If it begins with the twelfth month that is probably due to the fact that towards

40 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
the end of the last dynasty ofUr the Sumerian calendar at Ur and Umma also began the year with !egurkud, or Adar, as does also the calendar used by the Accadians in Elam. The secondary Ur calendar may have been brought to Assyria by the last kings ofUr, before the Aramaic invasion obtained control of Assyria. 1 These early Assyrian names continued to be used in Assyria as late as Tiglath-Pileser I (end of the twelfth century) and an inscription of that king states that in his time ara!J iji-hur was Kislev, thus beginning the year with Ayar.2 This is not long after the time when the early Assyrian names alone were in use and proves that during the Cassite period the northern kingdom began to adopt the Sumerian calendar long since current in Babylonia. It is uncertain when this change took place; when the Sumerian names of the Nippurian calendar came into universal use in Assyria, it is also uncertain whether the Assyrians translated them after the Babylonian manner or after their own earlier renderings. In the time ofTiglath-Pileser I it is entirelypossible that ittbarazaggar, first Sumerian month, was rendered Tanmartu and not Nisannu. Long after the Nippur calendar obtained ascendancy in Assyria the antiquarian Shalmanasar Ill (858-824 B.c.) still used ara!J mu-!Jur-iliini, the old name of the ninth month.3 This does not exhaust the month-names of the old Assyrian kingdom. The following months appear in Cappadocian texts but their positions are unknown: (a) ara!J zi-bi (or ~£-p£) bi-ri-im.4 (b) ara!J !a t£-i-na-tim,s month of figs?

MONTH-NAMES AT HANA 4I
At Hana on the middle Euphrates, the centre ofthe early Amorite-Aramaic people, in the early Cassite period, and in the time when the old Assyrian calendar was still in use, the following months occur: (a) arab ki-nu-nim, which was current also in Babylonia for the eighth month.1 This is probably an original Aramaic month-name. (h) arab te-ri-tum.2 Is this connected with the old Accadian arab tiri?
(c) arab a.Bllit-hi-ri.3 This is of mythological, hence Sumerian, origin. (d) arab d'fgi-kur-ra, 'month of the goddess of the face of the earth', goddess of the gate of the lower world. The myth on which this name is based must be the same as in Belat ekalli, sixth old Assyrian month,4 and reproduces the name of the sixth month at Nippur, kin-d·Jnnini, referring to the descent of Ishtar into Arallu by the seven gates.s The goddess Igikurra may be simply an epithet of lshtar as an underworld deity, describing her when she descended to seek for Tammuz,6 and equivalent to Bllat ekalli. The name is explained in a commentary by 'gate of the goddess of the lower world', and the month-name at Hana must refer either to the goddess ofthe lower world (Ereshkigal) or to lshtar as she who passed the seven gates to reach the abode of Ereshkigal.7

HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
Assur and Hana we are in the presence of an evolution from primitive Semitic month-names to the introduction of mythological names based upon the Sumerian calendars. Even here few old Aramaic or Accadian names have survived. There is here the same attempt to render salient aspects of the myths of Sumer as in the southern kingdom where the series Nisan-Adar was obtained in the same manner. The difference in practice between the Babylonians and Assyrians after the Amorite invasion was caused by the more tenacious Semitic character of the northern kingdom, and by the greater Sumerian influence in Babylonia. In the northern kingdom most of the names are actually written phonetically, whereas the usual practice in Babylonia was to write the Sumerian names. About the twelfth century Babylonian influence finally prevailed throughout Assyria and the Nippurian names came into common use there. Consequently when the first great Church Calendars were written in Babylonia in the Cassite period and copied by the Assyrians about 1000 B.c. the months are all written in the Nippurian manner. The Accadians in the time of the Agade dynasty, four centuries before the Amoritic conquests, had incorporated Elam in their empire,1 and under the dynasty of Ur, the Accadians, who had occupied Elam, introduced a Semitic version of the Nippurian and Ur calendars there, beginning with Adar. This was undoubtedly due, as in Assyria, to the influence of the order in the late Ur calendar where segurkud or Adar was the first month. The texts in which the socalled Susa calendar is used are all from the period of the first Babylonian dynasty.2 Two of the month-names are the same as the Babylonian

renderings of the Nippur calendar, i.e. Adaru and Abu; consequently the Nippur calendar must have been the basis for these Accadian names at Susa. Abu is the fifth month in both Babylonian and Susa calendars. Since the seventh Susa month is named sebuti, sibuti, 'seventh', counting from Adar, and Virolleaud, Shamash 14, 14 makes Adaru the first month, there can be no doubt but that it began the year. The other official lists place Adar opposite to Ayar, thus making the whole calendar two months later. Consequently these lists, in giving the Nippurian equivalents, cannot be used at all for determining the meanings, but only for the season. The order is established by two official lists1 and by internal evidence of the contracts. A star set against the names means that it was also used in Assyrian astronomy.
*
1. ara!J a-da-ri,2 'month of threshing'. Both official lists give Adar at Susa as equivalent to Ayar. This is the Babylonian rendering ofsegurkud, twelfth month in the Nippurian calendar; in the Ur series it is the first month towards the end of the Dungi period, as at Umma and secondary Assyrian series. In view of the name of the second month Adaru cannot be the month ofthreshing = harvest month; obviously the
Accadians at Susa employed Adaru merely because it was the first month.3
*2. ara!J si-ri-' ehilri, 'month of the vegetation ofharvest'.4

A variant1 is ara!J !e-ir-i !a e-,#-di, 'month of the vegetation of reaping'. But the fourth month is described as harvest time; see below. I take this to mean the month of mowing hay. ara!J a-!ag dingir-ra !e-gur-kud seems to be still another name for the second month, meaning 'harvesting the field ofgod'.2
*3· ara!J pi-ti bdhi, 'month of opening the gate'. This is explained by the month Tammuz in the officiallists,J and late Assyrian texts assure the identity of this month with Tammuz. 'The opening of the gate' here must refer to opening the gates of the lower world for the descent of Tammuz and not to the myths of the months Teshrit and Tebit where the gates of hell are opened that souls may rise for the parentalia.
*4· ara!J d·Ma!J, 'month of the great goddess'. This is explained as the fifth month of the Nippurian calendar, Ab.• The goddess Ma!J is usually Belit-ili, queen of the gods, the great mother goddess,s the goddess of child-birth. This cannot have anything to do with the myths and ceremonies of the Sumerian month izi-izi-gar = Ab, since the Susa calendar has the month-name ahu. See the fifth month.6

ACCADIAN CALENDAR IN ELAM 47
!e-ir-~u-um occurs passim as the name of a month but it may be for either 2 or 8 in this series. From the texts it is impossible to determine which month the scribe means. 1 It may be identical with !er~um kunii!i e~idi, which I have assigned to the fourth position. !e-ir-~i ili is also unplaced, xxm 294; 295; 299; 304. None of these names agrees with the native Accadian list of the Agade period,2 which is the only genuinely Semitic calendar in cuneiform texts. The Accadian calendar in Elam is based almost entirely upon Sumerian mythology, and two of its month-names agree with the Babylonian renderings of the Sumerian equivalents, Adar and Ab. It is, however, a real Semitic calendar and if traces of it are found in Babylonia3 itself some explanation must be given for its use in astronomy by the Assyrians of the late period. Since the Accadians of the Agade period had already begun to adopt the Nippur calendar, this Semitic calendar cannot have originated among them. Did it originate in Elam among the Accadians there when the kings ofUr ruled that land? If so, why do the Assyrian copies of Babylonian astronomical works show . a decided preference for the Elamitic series? Obviously the Babylonian astronomers of the Hammurabi period must have used this calendar, otherwise the survival in Assyria would be inexplicable. Thus in the history of the Babylonian and Assyrian religious calendars there arose three Semitic month-lists: (a) the Nisan-Adar list of Babylonia, based directly upon the Sumerian calendar; (b) the early Assyrian, ~arratu ~ippu list, based upon the late Ur calendar; (c) the Accadian list of Elam, based upon the U r calendar. Most of the names in all three calendars reflect the Sumerian myths of the months. In the evolution of the Church Year we are

HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
almost entirely concerned with the Babylonian year NisanAdar. The great menologies, which arose in Babylonia perhaps as early as !ZOOO B.c., resulted in the detailed directions found in the Assyrian menologies of the tenth century. Asurbanipal's reformed calendar of the seventh century, which attempted to more or less regulate all the twelve months and three intercalary months of the holy year on the basis of the earlier directions for Nisan, was also a copy from Babylonia. Details of how the Sumerian legends and festivals of the months descended down this long and complicated course of history, finally filtering into Judaism, Islam, Mandean, and classical lands, must be deferred here. The fact to be kept in mind is that the Babylonian calendar which finally suppressed all others in western Asia is mythological in its origin and not Semitic. The Babylonians now introduced almanacs and menologies to inform the people what they should do or not do every day of the lunar year. 1 The texts of the earliest menology have been found at Assur, and are dated circa 1000 B.c. (1) A very large tablet, VAT. 10564, carries six long columns on each side, in all twelve columns, almost entirely intact. This great text contains the Church Calendar for all the twelve months Nisan to Adar, and uses intercalary Nisan. The instructions for Nisan are given in detail for each day, but for the remaining months the instructions are more brief, on the whole containing only such special instructions as were necessary to supplement the Nisan instructions, which were generally applicable to all the months.2 A broken duplicate of VAT. 10564 is 10503.

(2) A large tablet, VAT. IOI 10, carries two columns on each side and gives the instructions for Nisan. KAR. I 76. (3) A large tablet, VAT. g663, carries four columns on each side. This tablet contains promiscuous directions for the days and months. The obverse columns 1-111 give the months in which it is propitious to do certain things. A palace may be founded in Ayar, Sivan, Ab, Elul, Tebit, Shebat, Adar. One may move out of a house in Sivan, Ab, Arahsamna, Tebit, Shebat, Adar. One may return to his house in Nisan, Ayar, Sivan, Teshrit, Arahsamna, Shebat, Adar. A king may build a temple or repair a holy place only in Shebat and Adar. A king may clean his garments in Nisan, Ayar, Sivan, Ab, Teshrit, Arahsamna, Shebat, Adar.I One may recite a penitential psalm in Nisan, Sivan, Ab, Teshrit, Arahsamna, Shebat, and Adar. This rule applies apparently to the king only. The instructions for cleaning a king's garments (sarru ~ubat-su libbib) are clearly connected with his instructions to recite a penitential psalm. The months for the two lists are identical except Ayar, which appears among the months for cleaning garments but not among the months for reciting a psalm. Moreover, the days of the months for both rites are nearly the same. In the old menology, sigu lissi, 'let him recite a penitential psalm', is
1 According to KAR. I 76 and I 78, the days set aside for cleaning the king's garments in Nisan are I, 6, 16, 27.

But for Sivan it is ordered for days 6+15; for Arahsamna, day 7· The directions for the other months 01nit it, implying that Nisan rules are to be followed. The reformed calendar enbu bel arbim, so far as preserved, orders the king to clean his garments on the 16th of all these months, but here also the prohibition for Tammuz, Elul, Kislev, Tebit must have been enforced; for the text of Elul II is preserved and 01nits this direction. Nisan II forbids the king to clean his garment on the 6th.

The old calendar forbids the sigu days 6, I6, 26, 28 of
Ayar,Z and orders it Sivan 6, I6, 26, 28, as does also the new calendar.J On the whole4 the calendars agree with the rule of the months and days.s It is permissible to change one's occupation or business6 only in Nisan, Ayar, Sivan, Shebat, and Adar. One is not allowed to take purgatives to move the bowels freely in Nisan and Tebit.' The months favourable for bringing a bride into a house are Nisan, Ayar, Sivan, Elul, Teshrit, Arahsamna, Shebat, and Adar, but days I and 3 are unfavourable. The time of the conjunctions of the sun and moon is favourable, and so is the morning watch of the night, but the evening and middle watches are unfavourable. The above selections from this tablet will enable the reader to understand how it served as a book of directions for important undertakings. Obverse IV then gives a list of the days or half-days of each month which were regarded as propitious in the calendars of the south, at Sippar, Nippur, Babylon, Ur, Larsa, Erech, and Eridu.9 This copy made for Assyria ends with the note, 'The days which are lucky for thee are 7x 6o (242) ....

work of days, for begetting children, for removing the grain heaps, and for bringing to success anything desirable.' 1 The tablet then gives the lucky days or half-days in each month after a copy of an older calendar at Assur.2 The lucky days in the southern and northern calendars are not in complete agreement. Then follow special instructions for days 3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16 of Nisan.3 Mter this follow special instructions for the first nine days ofTeshrit ofwhich a large number of duplicates are known.4 The tablet, therefore, was intended to be a great compendium of special directions for the year, adding instructions for the two holy periods or New Year festivals. The New Year festival in Nisan ran through the first sixteen days in the old Babylonian holy year; in the time of Nebuchadnezzar it was reduced to the first eleven days, owing to the discovery of the epact or eleven days difference between the lunar and solar years. This early Babylonian calendar, of which only the tenthcentury edition of Assyria has been preserved, used Nisan as the only intercalary month.s But the Sumerian calendars on which it was based used intercalary Adar. Semitic tradition prevailed here, for the Semitic series used in Elam had some unknown name for Nisan as the twelfth month, possibly tarbztum. Logic and tradition are incorrigibly
1 It is certain that Nazimaruttash, Cassite king (circa 1327-1302), was not recognized as king of Assyria; this was in fact the period when the kings of Assyria were actually masters of the Cassite kingdom. See
King, History of Babylon, 243· The Assyrian scribes must mean that it was Babylonian scholars who had edited these calendars in the time of Nazimaruttash, and that copies were found in the cities mentioned. It does prove that the Babylonians as early as the fourteenth century had already edited these calendars for the Cassite kings. z KAR. 177 Rev. IV 4-39. 3 KAR. 177 Rev.

52 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
confused here. Basing their holy year upon the Sumerian Church Calendar, which ended theyearwithAdarand began it with Nisan, the Babylonians, when they constructed a Church Calendar, made Nisan the first month. But in their own Civil Calendar as used in Babylonia and Elam Nisan was the last month1 and intercalary.2 Consequently the Babylonian and Assyrian calendars at first admitted only intercalary Nisan. In the seventh century this old Babylonian menology was replaced in Assyria by a great reformed calendar known as the series enbu bel arbim, 'The fruit (moon) is lord of the month', in fifteen tablets, one for each month and one for each of the three intercalary months Nisan, Elul, and Adar. It is not certain that this reformed calendar of Asurbanipal ever existed in Babylonia. At the end of the twelfth tablet or menology for Tebit there is a note saying that it is a copy from an older tablet.3 I presume, therefore, that sometime after the twelfth century this very formal and rigid canonical calendar was finally adopted in Babylonia. The religious acts permissible in each month and day are based upon the earlier holy year and books of instructions described above, but the influence of Sumerian mythology is more discernible, each month being assigned to a god, and the deities to whom each day was sacred is carefully entered. At the end of each tablet the scribe enters the acts permissible in that month. The Babylonian texts on the Church Calendar have suffered a more sad fate, few having been found up to the present. A large single-column tablet of a series which originally gave the rituals for the important ceremonies of each month has been preserved in two duplicates.4 Only the rites for Arahsamna, Kislev, Tebit are preserved. There is also a large fragmentary tablet carrying at

BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN ALMANACS 53
least three columns on each side which contained the principal rituals in each month for the whole year.1 Among other fragments of the Babylonian menologies special attention should be called to a remarkable commentary on Teshrit utilized in Chapter Il.2 In Assyria tablets of special instructions for important days of each month have also been found,J to which is attached special instructions for Teshrit.4 An Assyrian tablet (fragment) has special instructions for days 8-18 of Nisan.s The Babylonian almanac,6 which probably dates from the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, contains notes on each of the days of the twelve months. The entries agree generally with those on the old Assyrian calendar, but are frequently one day higher. For example, Tebit 5 is entered in the almanac as su-bat lum-ni 'abode (omen) of evil', whereas the menology has !ubat lumni for the sixth day.' Numerous examples of this disparity of one day run through the whole almanac and its Assyrian duplicates, so that for some reason days which are designated as lucky, or unlucky, days of

54 HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
weeping or rejoicing, &c., fall one day earlier in the calendars later than the tenth century. A good many days in this almanac, as in the old menology, are marked 'half of the day is lucky', corresponding to the mark set against certain days in the Roman calendars, EN = endotercisus, 'cut into parts'; in Rome this meant that morning and evening of such days were nefastus, unlucky, or business could not be done then, but the middle of the day wasfastus.1 The almanac marks the following days as 'half lucky', Ab 6; Teshrit 8, IS; Tebit 11, I7, 24, 27; Shebat Io, 29 (or 30 on Var.); for Nisan in the late period the statement depends upon an Assyrian text;2 days 4 and 6 are so marked. It is possible that the Babylonian almanac, which is the only one the Romans could have known, as it was in use as late as Ioo B.c., had only nine of these days corresponding to the eight used in the Roman calendar, March IS; August22; October I4; December 12; January 10, I4; February I6, 26. Warde Fowler remarks that they all fell on a day preceding some festival or on the day before the Ides. No such rule obtained in Babylonia. The old Assyrian menology marked many more days in the year after this manner. When the calendars marked a day magir, favourable, lucky, they could not possibly have meant the same as the Romans did in marking a day F = fastus, i.e. a day when civil business could be transacted; for days 7, I4, Ig, 2I, 28when all work was forbidden are often marked magir. In marking the days magir or la magir (unfavourable) throughout the year the Babylonians obviously meant lucky or unlucky. The Sumerians and Babylonians began the day at sunset, as the Greeks did. A day ran from sunset to sunset.l At Rome, at least in the time of the Republic, the day began at midnight. The Babylonians divided the day into I2 hours of equal length, one hour being 30 degrees of the sun's supposed revolution. But a more complicated system arose.

TABLE FOR RECKONING TEMPORAL HOURS 55
The night was divided into three watches, and the daylight into three watches. The night was held to be 12 hours long at any time of the year and so was the daylight. Consequently if the length of daylight in July is divided by 12 a much longer hour is obtained than a daylight hour in January. This is called the temporal hour, hora temporalis in Latin, oopa Katptt<i} in Greek. The water-clock showed pre

cisely how long a real hour was, but how could they discover the length of temporal hours? The Babylonians found a ready method for reading the lengths of temporal hours for each month, but all days in each month are reckoned on the same basis. Mr. Gadd discovered a fragment of a small ivory prism in the British Museum,1 which carries on each of its four faces a double column of figures. The copy and transcription were sent to Dr.J. K. Fotheringham, who discovered thatthecolumns on two of the faces gave (when restored) a system of reckoning the length of a temporal hour by day or night in each
month. The prism was originally only about 2! inches long
and l inch wide. It could be carried about in one's pocket and gave a quick method of reckoning for any one capable of making the calculations. The figure gives Mr. Gadd's copy of the four faces of the
1 Formerly but deficiently copied by Lenormant, Choix de Textes, No. 86, where he took the prism to be Regles d'un Jeu.



HISTORY OF THE CALENDARS
fragment from the middle of the prism. Faces A and B cannot be interpreted. Face C from line 3 onward· begins the section on Ayar and Elul, Arahsamna and Adar and is interpreted in my restoration, pp. 6o-I, lines I8-32. FaceD from line 2 onward begins the section on Tammuz and Tebit, the summer and winter solstices, consequently Tammuz includes our June 2I and Tebit our December 21. This is interpreted on pp. 62-3, lines I6-3o. Mathematically the whole day was reckoned as I 2 hours, or double hours of I20 minutes each. A double hour is a
beru, and this was divided into 30 us or units of 4 minutes. Now if the night and daylight are also reckoned as I2 temporal hours each the problem is to find out how many beru and uJ (in real time) are in any temporal hour. Obviously 24 temporal hours constitute a day and this is divided into two parts of I2 hours each, thus being the origin of our 24-hour day (in real hours) and also the system on which our I 2-hour clocks are based. In this discussion those who are unacquainted with the ancient system oftemporal hours should remember that the Babylonian I 2-hour half-day is not I 2 real hours but invariably means the length ofdaylight or night.l Nisan in this system includes the spring equinox, March 2I, and Teshrit the autumn equinox, September 2I in an ideal year. Of that there can be no longer any possible doubt. Day and night are regarded as ofequallengths in both months on this prism and here the table is precisely like a modern clock, fl-th of night is one temporal hour and also one real hour, and so is J.\th of daylight. At the summer solstice (Tammuz) daylight is twice as long as night; at the winter solstice (Tebit) night is twice as long as daylight. So the table roughly and somewhat inaccurately reckons the hours. This quickly disposes of four months. On this system the
1 My discussion is now based not so much on what remains of the prism but upon the certain restoration of it for the whole year based upon Fotheringham's discovery of the principles ofreckoning by means of Gadd's fragment.



PRINCIPLE OF THE TABLE OF TEMPORAL HOURS 57
month before the summer solstice and the month after the summer solstice, or Sivan and Ab, will have the same lengths of daylight and night. That is, a day in Sivan equals a day in Ab. The month before the winter solstice and the month after the winter solstice, or Kislev and Shebat, will have the same lengths of daylight and night. The month after the spring equinox and the month before the autumn equinox have the same lengths of daylight and night. The month after the autumn equinox and the month before the spring equinox will have the same lengths of daylight and night. These six principles gave rise to the four groups of reckoning for the whole year in my restored edition, the eight months outside the solstices and equinoxes being compressed into two groups by an ingenious method of inversion, and it is precisely here that Fotheringham has shown his astonishing brilliance by discovering how groups of four months were worked into one group. It is doubtful whether any other mathematician in Europe could have solved this problem so quickly. 1 The scheme, then, is to compress the tables in sections. In each of the four sections the number of beru (= I 20') and uJ (= 4') of daylight of a day in the two months under discussion is set over against the number of beru and uJ in a night of the same months. In case of a group offour months where two of them stand in inverse ratio as regards daylight and night all that is necessary is to invert day and night for them.2 Then follows the conversion into I, 2, 3, up to I 2 temporal hours in each group. The following table states in parvo the scheme of the prism.

Group B occupies the section on faceD, lines g-I I (pp.62-g,ll.I6-25) (whereitbreaksaway) andendsthetable. Groups C, D occupy the second section of the table, face C. It is headed bydaylightinAyar+ Elul, and night inArahsamna and Adar, and by night in Ayar and Elul and day in Arahsamna and Adar. Face C, Col. I, line 5 =page 6o, 1. 20, gives the length in real time of daylight in Ayar and Elul or 6i beru, being in our time (I beru = I 20 minutes) 6i x I20'= 8oo' = Ighr- 20'. The table leaves the observer to understand that a night in Arahsamna and Adar is I3 hours and 20 minutes. In other words day in group C = night in D. Col. 11 5 (p. 6o, 1. 20) gives the length of the night in Ayar and Elul in real time, i.e. 5 beru Io ul or 10hr. 40' in our time. From line 6 (p. 6o, 1. 2I) downward the observer is now told how long I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, g, 10, I I, I2 temporal hours are by day and night. Line 6 (p. 6o, 1. 21) supposes the following problem. 'If there are 6i beru daylight, what is one temporal hour, or what is-h of this daylight?' 6i beru (or 6 beru 20 u1) divided by I2; i.e. 200 us divided by I2 = I6i uS. Now to express fractions
of the us= alo part of a circle (or 4' in time), the Babylonians divided the us or Io into 6o parts of 4 seconds each.
Hence i u1 is written with 40, or t8- uS. Now Col. I, 1. 6, has the figure I6: 40. Daylight hour (temporal) is then I6i X 4' in our time, or 66' 40" or Ihr. 6' 40". Col. 11, 1. 6 has I3: 20 or I3 u1+-H us or I3l u1 =53' 20" length of one temporal hour by night in Ayar and Elul. 1 In the following discussion (')=minute, (")=seconds.



RESTORATION OF THE TABLE OF TEMPORAL HOURS 59
A temporal hour of day plus a temporal hour of night always equals 2 hours. Hence Day 66' 40" Night 53' 20'
I20' = 2 hrs.
This is reckoning time by the unit I0 of solar motion= 4' in our time. Hence one hour is precisely one hour of our time and day and night (each I2 hours) = 24 temporal hours. This is the origin of modern time-reckoning, the difference consisting only in the fact that the Babylonian temporal hour is defined by us as a real hour and does not change with the lengths of the days and nights. Line 7 (p. 6o, 1. 22) poses the problem: 'How long are two temporal hours?' Line 6 gave I6i uJ daylight for one temporal hour. Line 7 gives I beru 3! us or 33! us= I6ix 2. · With these examples in mind the whole prism can be reconstructed. FACE C

This prism proves that in the seventh century B.c. they fixed the beginning of the year at the new moon near the spring equinox. It proves that division of day and night into 12 hours each existed inBabylonia as in Egypt before it was known in Greece and Rome. The great Church Calendars of Assyria and Babylonia which I shall discuss in my next lectures are then based upon a year beginning with March, precisely as did the religious calendar of Rome. This rapid sketch of the historical influences which gave the ancient world its greatest Church Calendar has been written under most favourable circumstances. The discoveries of the last decades have placed the complete Babylonian Holy Year in our hands. We are now guided by a clear light down the halls of ancient history for 3,000 years; in this long history, involving the fate of nations, of civilization and religion, not natural and primitive religion but theology, mythology, and mysticism triumphed. That was· entirely due to the power of the Sumerian temple schools.
Babylonia, Assyria, and Judaism passed on this Holy Year to the West. It is based upon a striving after spiritual things. Here gradually the daily life of man becomes more and more regulated by a system which tends to suppress primitive rituals. The fate of man now rests in the constellations ofheaven, in the hands of the gods, and the calendars direct his way in all things.

The Syriac list is:

LECTURE II
THE MENOLOGIES AND ALMANACS FOR NISAN AND TESHRIT
I
HAVE traced the history of the Sumerian and Babylonian calendars from 3000 B.c. to the time of the promulgation of the first monthly and daily Church Calendar in Assyria in the tenth century. We have seen that the Sumerian official calendar began with March or the rising of Pleiades; that a prehistoric calendar existed which began with the seventh month or autumn equinox; that the Amorite invasion brought to Babylonia and Assyria a primitive Aramaic calendar also beginning in the autumn or Teshrit. The Church Calendars, therefore, regard Nisan and Teshrit as the most holy months. Both contain New Ye~r festivals and special attention must be given to them. The myths of these two months, their daily regulations and cults provide the subject of this lecture. The Babylonians accepted the Sumerian myths of the months, their monthly legends; they developed festivals based upon these myths. The daily directions contained in the menologies were used by everybody in Babylonia and Assyria. For example let us take a letter written by a priest to the king in the seventh century. The king wished to know whether he might do a certain public work on the 15th day of a certain month. He received the reply that the astrologers had read the calendar and discovered that the I 5th and 17th were both unpropitious and that he must do his work on the 16th.1 The first month of the year Nisan corresponds to MarchApril in the Roman calendar. This is the time when the Sun-god, victorious over winter's darkness, begins his ascent toward the zenith of heaven. The Sumerians at Nippur

believed that the earth-god, Enlil, in the first month sat in his cosmic chamber and held a convocation of the gods to fix the fates of all men for the coming year. The Sumerian word is iti bdr-zag-gar,1 explained by the Accadians as 'month of him that sits in the sanctuary'.2 The month almost certainly began originally with the new moon nearest the equinox, and in it fell ordinarily the heliacal rising of the Pleiades and Taurus.3 At that time, at least according to Babylonian custom, kings laid down their divine rights for a day4 and received again their throne and sceptre from the high priest ofEnlil or Marduk.s The commentary on Nisan runs: 'Nisan is the month of the constellation lku (Aries), which is the throne-room of Anu. The king is lifted up, the king is installed.s The blessed springing forth ofvegetation6 of (by) Anu and Enlil. Month of the Moon-god, first born of Enlil.' Since in the late period mul Iku governed Nisan, when the New Year festival of Marduk was instituted, this constellation was identified with Babylon.7 There is no reason in the myths of this month to assign it to the Moon-god, and the scribes in fact assigned it regularly to Anu and EnlilS

on the basis of the older connexion of the month with Taurus, in the Sumerian period.I All through the ages, from 3000 B.c. to the Greek period, Nisan was sacred to Enlil. At Babylon Marduk-Bel usurped the place of Enlil in the old New Year's myth and festival. The festival at Babylon began on the 1st of Nisan and lasted eleven days, a period which was probably based upon the epact.2 On the eighth fell the convocation of the gods under the presidency of Marduk at Babylon, and ofAshur in Assyria. Then was written 'the eternal fate, the fate of life, and Nabu, scribe of the gods, wrote the tablets'. But in the old mythology the tablets of fate belonged to Enlil,3 and that was undoubtedly the belief among the Sumerians when they named this month bara;:,aggar. Since Taurus governed this month 300o-2ooo B.c., when the myth arose concerning the Sumerian month, the legend of the assembly and the decree of fates was connected with that .constellation. The principal star of Taurus is Aldebaran,4 called 'star of the tablet' long after Taurus had ceased to govern Nisan. Why then did the Arabs name the great star in the head of Taurus Aldebaran (al-dabariinu) 'the forecaster' or 'the writer'? Surely they had inherited this same myth that with the rising of Taurus the gods wrote the fates of all men.s The natural meaning of al-dabaran in Arabic
1 Taurus is an Anu star, CT. 33 II I. 2. Note that the special instructions for Nisan in the old calendar, KAR. I 77 Rev. IV 4o-m 7 and late Erech text, Falkenstein, Uruk, 54, 5-I I and Ki. I904-Io-g, I2-I5, for days 3, 5, 7, I2, I3, I5, I6 has a period of I6 days, i.e. up to the full moon, which is probably the period of the old festival. These special instructions do not differ much from the regular Nisan calendar in KAR. I76 and I78. 3 Legend ofZu; see Sem. Myth. IOI-2; confided by Enlil to Ninurta, SBP. 208, 5·

Aldebaran is usually written mul gis-da(le'u). See Kugler I Taf. IV25 and p. 29 and Jeremias, Das Alter der Bab. Astronomie, 33, I 3, mul-mul'i~uzi-e, i.e. PleiadesandTablet (Aldebaran). 5 al-dabaranu surely means 'the writer' or 'forecaster' and not 'the one

is 'the follower', and the Arabists accept this on the grounds that two other names for Aldebaran mean 'follower'. If this is correct perhaps the Arabians misunderstood the real meaning of the word after its connexion with the myth had been forgotten. The myth of the writing of fates in the New Year survived in Islam, but the months being strictly lunar have there no astronomical association. Nabu, the divine scribe, who bears the tablets of fates, figures, then, in the old myth of Nisan. Here are legend and astronomy so old that they can be definitely assigned to the Nippurian calendar and the early Taurus period. In late mythology Marduk assembled the gods to decree fate on Nisan 8 and I I.1 The special day must have been the 8th, for Nabu, 'bearer of the tablets of fate',2 who assembles the Igigi and Anunnaki, had a 'shrine of fates'3 at Barsippa, from which he departed on Nisan 5 for the 'shrine of fates' in Esagila at Babylon and returned on the eleventh.4 Now it is curious that Nisan 8 is marked as a festal day of Nabu together with days 4 and 17 of that month in the reformed calendar, and hence this festival (eJ!e!u) of Nabu was ex
who follows after', the meaning commonly given in English lexicons 'because it follows Pleiades', i.e. rises after Pleiades. This meaning has been given to dabartin because it is said to be the same as tiil£ al-nagmi, 'Follower of Pleiades'; Lane, Arabic Lexicon, 296; Dictionary of Islam, sub 'AI-Debaran'. The ordinary meaning of dabara is 'to follow', but it also means 'write a book' and 'forecast'. It cannot be the rump of Taurus, Lane, p. 847, for it stands in the face of this constellation. Aldebaran is also said to be al-ttibi'u al-nagmi, or tuwaibi'un, the follower of the Pleiades, Lane, 2g6. If these identifications are certain in Arabic and 'the follower ofPleiades' really is Hyades and Aldebaran, the meaning 'forecaster', 'writer' is excluded. Hava, Arabic-English, 195, derives Aldebaran from dibratun, 'Western part of the sky', i.e. from root meaning 'follow after'. The meanings 'to manage', 'arrange', 'forecast' are certain, but 'to write', 'compose a book' lacks confirmation and may be a confusion for dhabara. I VAB.

TAURUS IN THE MYTH OF NISAN 7I
tended to days 4, 8, 17 of all months.1 Is it possible that the legend of writing the tablets on days 4, 8, 17 of Nisan obtained in the older myth of this month ?2 In the Babylonian New Year festival a white bull (GUD-UD) was sacrificed on Nisan 5 and a hymn called the 'Divine Bull, brilliant light' was sung, said to be the bull ofAnu, i.e. Taurus.J Thureau-Dangin has cited the Georgica of Virgil on this legend, The white bull who with golden horns opens the year.
The first day of Nisan was sacred to Enlil owing to this myth of Sumerian origin.4 Consequently the first of every month became sacred to Enlil in the reformed calendar.s In the reformed calendar for the first day of each month the following instructions are given: 'When on the first day the moon appears (i.e. evening of first day) by night the shepherd of the great peoples6 [offers] his food-offering, a white kid for the new moon. The king shall wash himsel£ In the morning his food-offering he shall set forth to Shamash and the Queen of the Lands, to Sin and Mah.' Since the instructions for each day of all months in this reformed calendar were largely nothing but a sterile application of the rules of Nisan, it is obvious that the 'white kid' originally pertained to the first day of Nisan, and symbolized Taurus instead of a white bull. Curiously the old Assyrian instructions for Nisan first make no reference to this. At Ur the first month was in fact named iti ma!-da-kU,7

72 THE MENOLOGIES AND ALMANACS FOR NISAN
'month ofeating the kid', and a variant has 'month of eating the white kid'. This name is surely based upon a .. ritual wherein a white kid is substituted for the white bull, symbol of Taurus. According to one text the governor of Lagash presided over this ceremony under the kings of Ur, 1 and sacrifices were made to Enlil in this month on the 22nd day,2 or on the 20th.J On tablets dated by intercalary e;:.en-mekigal, corresponding to Nisan, sacrifices were made to Enlil on day 4,4 day 7;s one text has sacrifices to Enlil and Ninlil on days 6 and 7 where the ritual is called 'feast of the porphyry bed of Gimil-Sin'.6 At Lagash the Sumerians named this month itiezen d.Ningirsu-ka gan-ma!-ba, 'month of the feast ofNingirsu, the apportioning of ganma!' ,1 or simply e;:.en gan-ma!, 'feast of the ganma!', or usually month gan-ma!. The meaning of this name is obscure, but it obviously contains the same word 'kid' (ma1). 8
The Nippurian name bara;:.aggar was rendered by ni-saan-nu in Accadian,9 a Sumerian loan word10 meaning 'first'; hence Nisan means simply 'first month'. The word means also 'sacrificer', 'to sacrifice',11 and if this be the sense then
kug-ta in the menologies, IV Raw. 33* Is; K. 2514 I 2; IV Raw. 32 I 3 restored by K. 4788 is uncertain. 'Clean kid' is the usual rendering. 'White bull' in the text cited above is written alpu piF2 (gud-Ia.g). For kug = ellu in the sense 'white', the meaning kug = kaspu, silver, can be deduced, and see el-lum = lj.alpt1, ku~~t1, snow, V Raw. 24, No. 2, g-xo; also limsi kima el-li, let him wash (his hair) like snow, Epic Gilgamish XI 240, 248. 1 Radau, EBH. 299 note. 2 Langdon, Drehem, No. 22. 3 CT. 32, 44, 103442; Schneider, Drehem, No. 22. 4 CT. 32, 41-3. 5 Schneider, Drehem, No. 25. 6 CT. 32, 12, I, 1-12. 7 Allotte de la Fuye, DP. 152 XI 1.

ORIGIN OF THE SEVEN DAY WEEK 73
the Accadians may have intended by nirannu to convey the sense 'month of the sacrificer', referring to the offering of a white bull or kid in honour of Taurus.1 This name then passed into Hebrew, Nabataean, and Aramaic as Nisan.2 The gods assigned to each day of Nisan in the old menology afterward became the deities of the same days in the other months, and the regulations for Nisan became those of the other months;l this menology simply directs that the Nisan rites apply to other months.4 The reformed calendar of Asurbanipal actually enters them in the text, but this edition introduces a septem principle into the lunar month based upon rest days 7, I 4, I g, 2 I, 28. The idea of dividing the period ofthe normal visibility ofthe moon, twenty-eight days, into four parts or weeks becomes clear in the seventhcentury calendar. The history of the calendar of Nisan is, therefore, of supreme importance. I examine here the contents of the menology of the tenth century for Nisan and compare it with Nisan in the Asurbanipal series.s The reader must bear in mind that no text for Nisan in the Murbanipal series exists. It is assumed that Nisan 11 was the same as Nisan I.

old menology. This act of prostrating oneself to the Sungod and Moon-god can have no connexion with the !igu or penitential psalm, which is ordered for days 6, I6, 27, 28 of Nisan. In other words, on some days a !igu is ordered when prostration to Sin and Shamash are forbidden. 1 In the old and new menologies as well as in the almanacs an omen is usually attached at the end of the instructions for each day. The old menology often adds libba-!u #ab, 'his heart will be happy' (if he does all these things) or in the negative 'his heart will not be happy' (if he fails to do these things). Occasionally all three classes of texts use !agbulla, 'there will be joy ofheart'. The reformed calendar prefers almost universally the omen 'the lifting of his hand2 will be acceptable with god', a phrase never used in the tenth-century menology nor in the almanacs. Sometimes both menologies have mala itabbu itti ili magir, 'whatsoever he says will be acceptable with god',J and amat pi-!u !emat, 'the word of his mouth will be acceptable'.4 It is obvious that the ordinary prayers of 'lifting the hand' in rituals of expiation could be said on any day of the year, even on the most terrible day of the months, the nineteenth.s Now from the resume ofNisan given above it will be seen that days I, 7, g, I4, Ig, 2I, 28, 29, 30 are rest-days, when physicians may not practise nor seers prophesy. In the reformed calendar these nine days are reduced to 7, I4, Ig, 2I, 28, or almost the septem principle, or division of the

lunar month into weeks of 7 days; the last week adds one or two days until the new moon of the next month, when the first week of the next month begins. The new calendar insists on a certain amount of fasting and refraining from riding on the part ofthe king. These instructions are written into this menology for days 7, I 4, I g, 2I, 28 of every month. Days 26 and 27 were also days of sorrow and penance preparatory to the 28th, when the Moon-god crossed the river of death and joined Nergal, lord of the dead, in the darkness of Arallu. Services to the gods of hell mark the two days before the eclipse of the moon. During the whole of the 2gth and goth, while the moon remained invisible, none could travel by road or go out of his gate.I A special rubric was drawn up which forbids going out of a gate on the 2gth day of all the months.2 Another text has, 'Go not out ofthe gate on the 2gth; (if one does) fire will fall on the house of the man'.3 Omens for going out of the gate on the 29th of each month have been listed by an Assyrian scribe.4
'If on the 29th of Nisan thou goest out of the gate ... verily, 0 man, thou shalt die.' 'If on the 29th ofAyar thou goest out of the gate thy house ...,s with gloom (ik-li-ta) shall thy house be filled.'6 'If on the 29th of Sivan thou goest out of the gate, there will be destruction of the house.'
'If on the 29th of Tammuz one goes out of the gate, the wife of that man will die.'

ASSYRIAN MENOLOGIES COPIED IN BABYLONIA 85
Before I enter into a further discussion of the problem of the Sabbath week it is necessary to say a word concerning the probable date of these rules about days on which physicians could not heal, prophets could declare no omens, and men might not pursue their ordinary vocations. When and where did these rules originate? They are found only in the Assyrian promulgations of the church breviaties of the tenth and seventh centuries. But Babylonia and not Assyria exercised the principal influence upon J udaea. The Jewish calendar was borrowed from Babylonia two centuries after the Assyrian Empire fell in 61 2 B.c. The editors of the tenth-century calendars state that they had copied the menologies from older copies. One of them mentions in his note that Eridu, the ancient Sumerian city in the extreme south, possessed the Babylonian original. They also state that they copied at Sippar, Nippur, Babylon, Ur, Larsa, and Erech. The tenth-century breviaries of Assyria have an appendix which gives a ready table for finding the lucky days in each month. This table oflucky days has two sections; one gives the views of the Babylonians, the other of the Assyrians. It is, therefore, obvious that the tenth-century Assyrian calendar is of Babylonian origin; these rules undoubtedly date from the great classical period of Babylonian civilization, the age of Hammurabi. The institution of rest-days, enforced so rigidly that even the sick might not be attended by a physician, is then of great antiquity in both Babylonia and Assyria. The Pharisees rebuked the disciples ofJesus for plucking ears of corn on the Sabbath. The crowning offence ofJesus in the eyes of the Pharisees was the healing of the man with a palsied hand on the Sabbath: 'And they watched him whether he would heal on the Sabbath day that they might accuse him.' These strict rules about healing, working, travelling on certain days do not belong to early Hebrew religion. They are post-exilic and rather obv\ously under Babylonian influence. Josephus, who wrote in New Testament times, also



86 THE MENOLOGIES AND ALMANACS FOR NISAN
says that 'it is not lawful for us to travel either on the Sabbath or feast-days'. These rules were known in Babylonia, and the problem is whether the days coincide with the Hebrew sabbaths. That the Babylonian menologies forbade work on certain days is beyond doubt. One breviary for selected days of the year states that all work is forbidden during the entire month of Teshrit.l The menology of the tenth century has the formula:
A physician shall not lay his hand upon the sick; The prophet shall declare no word. It is not suitable for executing any affair. This formula occurs in the tenth-century menology in Nisan for days I, 7, 9, J4, I9, 2I, 28, 29, so, i.e. 9 rest-days.2 It is clear that the first day of the month was originally a day of rest and fasting: so were days 7, 9, I4, I9, 2I, 28, 29, 30. Undoubtedly these mark stages in the phenomena of the moon; the first quarter, full moon, first quarter of the old moon, day of the moon's disappearance, that is, 7, I4, 2I, 28, are clearly moon-phases. There is, here, already in the tenth century textual evidence for the idea of a sevenday week. The reformed calendar admits only 7, I4, I9, 2I, 28. The I9th day of all months is marked 'day of wrath' of the goddess Gula. No work was done; weeping and lamentation filled the land; no one might wash his feet on the I9th, change his garments, nor eat any cooked food. ASurbanipal in the seventh century promulgated a calendar with a definite scheme ofa seven-day week, a regulation of the month by which all men were to rest on days 7, I4,

NINETEENTH DAY, DAY OF WRATH 87
I9, 2I, 28. The old menology ofNisan made the two days of the dark of the moon, 29, 30, rest-days, so that each lunar month had 9 rest-days, on which neither the sick could be cured nor a man in difficulty consult a prophet; none might travel and fasting was enforced. In the seventh century days I, 9, 29, 30 were dropped; days 7, I4, I9, 2I, 28 became rest-days in all the months. No one has ever explained why the I9th was retained. The persistent emphasis upon this day of wrath of the goddess of childbirth and healing from the earliest times to the end of this civilization is difficult to explain. The dies irae of Babylonia began by some peculiar myth concerning the I9th day after the first new moon. Any explanation of the dies irae of Babylonia must be sought in some myth concerning the I9th of the first month. 'For the sake ofBau (Gula) one may not sweep his house', see p. 78. Why should the I9th day after the moon of the spring equinox be a day of wrath of the great goddess of medicine? It corresponds to the quinquatrus of the Roman farmers' calendar, the I9th of March, five days after the full moon. Ovid says that Minerva was born on that day, she being the Pallas Athena of the Greeks, described by him as patroness of those who banish sickness by Phoebus' art. Latin scholars discount Ovid's explanation and claim that the Roman I9th of March was a day sacred to Mars when the arms of Roman soldiers were purified. Although Minerva and Gula are both goddesses of medicine, there is still no explanation either in Babylonian or Latin mythology as to why the I9th should be a day of wrath in all the calendars of ancient Chaldea.1 On the I9th ofevery month

the Babylonians fasted, forbade all work and held the day in mournful memory of the wrath of the goddess Gula. On this day the king set forth food-offering to the constellation Orion, who, they said, had been slain with weapons. But the beautiful young hunter of Greek mythology, Orion, was also slain by the arrow of Artemis. Now the Sumerians called this constellation Sibzianna, 'the faithful shepherd of heaven'. Why then did the Greeks also call it Orion unless the myth of this constellation was the same among Sumerians and Greeks? There was then a legend in Sumerian and in Greece that a beautiful hunter had been slain by a goddess-in Greece because this young god had assaulted her; in Babylonia because he had rejected her. Is there a reason for connecting the giant hunter of the sky (who stands with his dog Canis between Taurus and Castor and Pollux) with Nisan, or with the I gth of March? The rising of Orion in Nisan could occur only in the remote age before 3000 B.c., the period of the Gemini. Why should the rising of the slain hunter Tammuz who had been chained to Orion coincide with a day kept in memory of the wrath of the goddess who slew him?
Artemis' arrow by fateful error slew Orion in the wild sea waves.

Gula is said to be themotherofd·Ab-U(ba) = Tammuz, SBP. I 56, 38; Tammuzand Ishtar, 8 n. I. The texts refer to Sibzianna slain by weapons, and the Greek myth records how Orion the beautiful youth and hunter was slain by Artemis with an arrow because of his love-affair with Eos; others said that he offered violence to Artemis, who killed him with an arrow. Tammuz does not figure as a hunter in Sumerian mythology, but Ninurta = Nimrod probably did.



THE SEVEN-DAY WEEK 8g
tion in Babylonia, surely existed in most remote Sumerian antiquity. The death of Tammuz or Orion by the weapon of the goddess obsessed the religious imagination of Babylonia and Assyria, and they extended the commemoration to the I9th of every month. The legend has been preserved in Hebrew by that antiquarian poet the author ofJob:
'Dost thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades Or untie the cords of Orion?'1
Omitting the I9th day of rest, the remaining days 7, I4, 2I, 28 in the calendar of the seventh century obviously constitute the seven-day division of the month. This scheme is fully carried out somewhere between Iooo B.c. and 6oo B.c. Here the weeks do not continue in a regular cycle regardless of the new moon. Each month has four weeks, beginning with the new moon. Days 29 and so, or in case of a 29-day month, day 29, are simply thrown out of the four-week system. I have no doubt but that this was the old Hebrew scheme also. In other words the fourth week has one or two extra days. Every month must begin with the first day of the first week. Is then the Hebrew Sabbath of Babylonian origin? Certainly the late Pharisaic adherence to the law which forbade healing or even an act ofmercy on the Sabbath is due largely to the Babylonian and Assyrian Church Calendar. This Pharisaic attitude is traceable to the Exilic period in Hebrew. A Hebrew was stoned to death for gathering sticks on the Sabbath day, according to a passage in the Priestly document ofNumbers, IS, s2-6. The institution of days 7, I4, 2I, 28 of every month as rest-days was, then, carried out after Iooo B.c. The idea obtained up to that period and at that time it included day I, New Moon, days 9+ I9, and days 29, so, Dark of the Moon. All of these were thrown
1 Job 38, 31. The Hebrew kesU = Orion has never been explained, but since Tammuz is known in mythology as 'a fool, cripple', Sum. lil, it is probable that kesil is the ordinary Hebrew word 'fool'.

out to obtain a seven-day week throughout the year in the reformation of the calendar about 700 B.c. On these days the prophet might not issue an omen, but from the year 191 I B.c., a millennium before these rules were introduced into all the months, a document dated on the 21st of Adar exists, in which a seer explains how on that day he consulted a sheep's liver and informed the king Ammizaduga of Babylon that he could give orders to make a statue of his predecessor Hammurabi. 1 If, then, the Assyrian menologies appoint days 7, 14, 19, 2 I, 28 as rest-days, you naturally ask-did they call these days sabbaths? There is nothing in the official calendars of any period or place to show that they did. The Greeks also divided the month according to the phases of the moon, but they obtained a system of decads, first 10 days ia-r6:1,1evos, the waxing month, JJEcroov, second 10 days, middle month, cp6{voov, the last 10 days, waning month. But the Greeks in the time of Homer and Hesiod divided the month into two parts, days 1-15 and 15-30, the waxing and the waning month. Now the 15th of the month inBabylonian is called sapattu, or fabattu; 2 this word is described as 'day of the resting of the heart',3 day when the heart of god is appeased. 'Ishtar the queen who answers (the gods) in my stead, sister of Marduk' is called 'mother of the fd-bat-tu day', which is the 'father of the month'.4 sabattU is definedS as 'the day', and comes after the 14th in an astronomical text.6 It is also defined by 'coming to rest', end of a period.7 If one says,

ORIGIN OF THE WORD SABBATH 91
'either on the day of the New Moon, on the 7th, or on the !apattu day (complete it)', the 15th day is meant.l Hence !abattu, !apattu, !abattu means 'end of the first half of the month', middle of the month as the Assyrian scribes explain it.2 The Greeks also divided the month into two parts, and for purposes of reckoning accounts the Sumerians used the same system,J and the Babylonians described the second half of the month as 'the latter period of 15 days',4 and the 'former half' was known as the 'former period of 15 days' .s Hence they said 'former sabattu' and 'latter !abattu'. The word means literally the 'day which divides the month', end of a series of days.6 The Egyptians also see fcd-te ka-la u-mi, 'at the end of any day'' opposed to ina serim, 'in the morning', KAR. 2r2,m, 6; cf.l. 4· For sig, to repose, v.

6 Root sabiitu = gamiiru, to be complete, CT. r8, 13 A r2; see above sabattum = fcatU. This is probably the same verb as Arabic sabata, 'to cut off, cease, rest'; Hebrew siibiit, 'cease from work, rest'. The Egyptians use the word s-m-d-t for the 15th day, i.e. the halfof the month, 1uxo1Jf1VIa, 'dividing the month', full moon, written with a half-moon, and they also divided the 36 decans into two parts, the 18th being called 1-m-d, IIJcrr, the divider, Sethe, Die .<,eitrechnung der alten Aegypter 47-8; Ramses IV, twelfth century. Brugsch renders 1-m-d by the divider (smad). The word is as old as the Middle Kingdom, 20oo-r 788 B.c., but I cannot believe that it is borrowed from sabattu, as Zimmern, Fremdw. 67, suggests. Zimmern gives the Egyptian root as s-b-!, but I see no reason for this. In any case !mad, smadt, divider, 15th day, is the same Semitic word as

named the 15th day famadt, the divider; consequently the Babylonian word sabattu is probably the Hebrew word !abbat, Sabbath, the 7th day of each lunar week. Now if this Babylonian word is used for the 15th day only1 and the Hebrew word for every 7th day on which all work was prohibited, it is natural to suppose that sabattu or the 15th should be a rest-day also. There is no trace of this at all in the menologies.2 The 15th day never has any reference to its being unsuitable for work, nor is the work of physicians and diviners prohibited. The following table gives full information on this day so far as our sources permit.J

The reformed calendar standardizes this day on the basis of Nisan in the tenth-century calendar.

The only acts permitted on these days are offerings to certain gods, sacrifices, and prayer. ASurbanipal's reformed calendar then had five rest-days and they are marked 'sad days' in the calendar.2 The Pharisaic spirit now prevails in Babylonia and Assyria. Obviously this was the influence which turned the Hebrew

Sabbath into a day after the manner of the Protestant Puritans. The problem as to why the Hebrews chose the Babylonian word sabattu as a name for these days of rest is a mystery. The idea of a regular seventh day ofrest arose in Babylonia; of that there can be no doubt. The Babylonians had a special name for these days; it is in fact ubulgallu, or umu limnu, that is 'day when it is dangerous to break the rules'. Their sabattu means the I sth day which divides the month. The word means 'divider' and the 15th is in no manner a rest-day. The Hebrews seem to have borrowed this word through a complete misunderstanding of the Babylonian calendar. After they had applied it to the rest-days they derived a verb stibtit from it which means 'to rest'. The great festival of Nisan in the Jewish calendar, the offering of first-fruits and the first-born of the herds, was fixed by Ezekiel on the 14th of this month. Now the old Assyrian calendar marks the 14th ofNisan II by the 'bringing in' of offerings,1 and so does the reformed calendar of the seventh century. It has been presumed that the Hebrew
Passover and Feast of Unleavened Bread had been finally fixed on the 14th of Nisan because it falls on the day of the full moon. Ezekiel may have had this in mind, but the Assyrian note on the offering of first-fruits of the harvest on this day is as old as the tenth century and probably much more ancient. This can hardly be a mere coincidence. Ezekiel almost certainly obtained the date of the Passover directly from the Babylonian Church year-books. The first month of the year seems to have been regarded as most holy and dangerous. The character of Nisan may be seen from the following table:
(1) No palace could be founded in that month. (2) The foundation of a house could not be put down.
1 KAR. I78 Obv. IV, I7, mu-un-tum = !urubtu. For this K. 25I4, 43 has ir-bu . • . These are of course omens and not instructions, but since the words occur for this day only, they are surely based upon a custom of bringing offerings on Nisan I 4·

(3) A family could not move out of a house in Nisan. (4) Afamilycouldnot move in at any time during Nisan. (5) But a family could move into a new house in Nisan. (6) No temple could be built in this month nor in any month except Shebat and Adar. (7) A tomb might not be made in Nisan. (8) No one could be buried in a grave in this month. (g) A well could not be opened. (Io) No one was allowed to take aperient medicine. (I I) A man could not sweep his roof. (I2) It was a lucky month for the birth of males, and for marnage.
TESHRIT (SEPTEMBER-QCTOBER)
The Sumerians divided the twelve lunar months into two parts, precisely as did the Egyptians. 1 There is consequently a second New Year in the Sumerian and Babylonian calendars. The custom ofbeginning the year in the autumn after
the feast of ingathering of the last fruits, the !Jag hii'iisip, at the end of the year, was the original Hebrew custom. The Canaanites began the year with the feast of ingathering
'osep.2 Not until the Exile did the Hebrews adopt Nisan or the spring equinox as the first month. Ab£b, the old Hebrew name for Nisan, was in reality the seventh month originally. When documents of the Old Testament name Ab£b the first month they are speaking in terms ofthe Babylonian calendar. This ancient tradition of the Canaanite and Hebrew people could not be suppressed by the Babylonian reformation of the calendar. They had celebrated the New Year in the month ltiin£m or September from the days of the remote antiquity. But Ezekiel and the Hebrew patriots of the Exilic period also found in the Babylonian books of the Holy Year a similar tradition. In fact, if Ezekiel had in his hands a copy of the menology he found that Teshrit has at

least six special tablets for the feast of the New Year during the first nine days ofTeshrit. At Nippur the Sumerians named the seventh month du-kug, 'month of the holy chamber', called alar Simiiti, 'place offates', in Ubsukina in Esagila, where on the days 8 and I I of Nisan the gods decreed the fates of all men. 1 Dukug is also the chamber of the water-god Ea in the nether sea.2 The 'festival of the Dukug' in Sumerian was, therefore, a New Year ceremony based upon the same mythology as the New Year festival of Nisan. This festival was held at the beginning of the second half of the year throughout Sumer, as the evidence of a tablet dated by the Ur calendar shows. At that city the seventh month3 was known as d-ki-ti, 'month of the New Year festival', ak£ti being a special name for this mythological series of ceremonies.4 But a tablet dated in the month Ak£ti and in the year 40 of Dungi contains a list of sheep and kids for the 'festival of the Dukug'.s This Sumerian name conveys the same sense mythologically as
harazaggar, the word for Nisan, but it cannot be traced to a period before the Agade period, 2732-2549 B.c. The Babylonian rendering of dukug by te1-ri-tu,6 'the

beginning' of the year, in no way translates the original meaning. The early Assyrian rendering sa kinati refers to a cult of the souls of the dead in this month, 1 and the rendering at Susa by lalubU is obscure.2 About 2000 B.c. the constellation which governed this month was connected with judgement of the living and the dead, the time when the gods fixed the fates, and consequently the Babylonians out of pure imagination saw the sign of the scales, Libra, here.3 "'"1Zibanna, i.e. 'the star Zib of heaven', Accadian loan-word takkab Z,ibanttu, 'the scales', Libra, was a name assigned to this constellation when it was still regarded as part of Scorpio. This word does not mean 'scales', but when the Babylonians for mythological reasons saw the symbol of judgement in these stars it was called "'"1rin, 'the scales',• and hence zibanttu also came to mean 'scales'. In astronomy "'"1Zi-ba-an-na continued to be the name of the 'horn of Scorpio',s and the Arabic zubtinaytini, 'shears of Scorpio', is derived from it; Libra in Greek is also X11Aa{, 'shears of Scorpio'; Chelai enim Scorpii Libram faciunt. 6 Libra as the constellation of the hypsoma of Saturn was identified with Shamash, and hence Saturn is described as the 'star of justice and righteousness'.? This idea survives in the Mandean legend of Abathur, 'he of the scales',8 the angel with the moztinf)lti 'scales', who dwells in the lower world and passes judgement on the souls.9 With this idea is con

In the late Hebrew calendar the 1st day of Teshrit was a day ofjudgement; so Psalm 81, 4-5: 'On the day of the new moon blow up the trumpet (and) at the full moon on the day of our feast; for this is a law unto Israel, a (day of) judgement (milpat) of the god of Jacob.' The Talmud, Targum, and the whole of Jewish tradition connect this passage with Teshrit.2 The myth of a general judgement of souls goes back to the Babylonian belief based upon the passing of the sun beyond the equator and the beginning of his descent into the lower world, when Libra rises heliacally. According to the Talmud,J from Teshrit 1st to the Day of Atonement (1oth) is a period of the condemnation of the doubtful and the Mishna describes Teshrit 1st as a day ofjudgement."' These are the ten terrible dayss of the world's judgement in Jewish tradition. Then are written the three books of the good, the doubtful, and the damned, a myth undoubtedly inherited from Babylonia and latterly transferred to the first eleven days (epact) of Nisan by the Babylonians. The same belief is preserved in Arabic tradition being attached to the ninth month, Ramadan, when Allah decides the fate of spirits, men, animals, and birds. According to Sumerian tradition a goddess kept the tablets of fate in Arallu.6

RULES FOR NEW YEAR IN TESHRIT 101
The date of the Day of Atonement on the tenth ofTeshrit in Hebrew religion is probably connected with the calendars, which have special directions for the first nine daysi outside the regular calendar. A list ofinstructions for special days ofeach month has the rule that for the whole ofTeshrit 'all work is not to be'.z I give here a resume of the special rules for Teshrit, days 1-g. A= Old Assyrian. B =A§urbanipal's edition. C = Notes from other sources.

Days 1-7 of Teshrit are, therefore, a period of penance in both Babylonian and Assyrian menologies, ending with the mostsombre and mournful day of the year, the seventh. Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 all mention Enlil, the god who in the old Sumerian myth convened the divine assembly to decree fates at the beginning of the year. The .seven-day period



PARENTALIA IN TESHRIT 105
is followed by rejoicing for the same god, and in Babylonia there is a second day of rejoicing on the gth with offerings to the goddess of healing. As a time ofjudgement when a god is implored to intercede with another on behalf of men, this month was also the time of making offerings to the dead. A commentary explains this. 'Teshrit is (the month) of the "Yoke of Enlil".1 The emblems are cleaned. People and prince purge themselves. Pure sacrifices of the lands for the year shall be made to the Anunnaki (gods of the lower world). From the gate of the Apsu shall they come up.2 Funeral offerings are made to Lugaldukug, "king of the Dukug", to Ea (god of the Apsu) and to Ninki (wife of Ea). Month of the grandfather ofEnlil.'J Teshrit or October, then, was the traditional time for sacrifices to the dead, when the Sun-god begins his descent to the land of the dead. The same ceremony survived in the Syrian calendar as late as the Middle Ages. In the former Teshrin of the ~abeans at Harran, in the middle of the month, they burnt food-offerings4 to the dead during the night, and burnt a bone from the thigh of a camel to the dog of the wicked workings female (goddess) that this dog of the terribleunderworld6 goddess frighten not the dead. And they poured out wine on the fire for the dead thattheymightdrinkwhiletheyatetheburntfood-offerings.7 The reference to the demoness of hell, who with her dogs frightens the souls of the dead, may be of Greek origin. The only reference to a goddess with dogs in Babylonian mythology is found in an incantation to Ninkarrak (Gula), whom

the sufferer beseeches to hold back her whelps.1 There is no reference to Gula, goddess of healing, whose symbol was a dog, in the instructions for Teshrit except on day g, and here worship of her constellation wards off sickness. If the Syrian myth of a lower-world goddess and her dogs is based upon Babylonian mythology it must refer to Ninegal, the underworld goddess mentioned in the instructions for days 7, 8. The Greek Attic month Boedromion corresponds to Teshrit, and on the 5th of Boedromion fell the Genesia, feast of ancestors.2 There is a connexion between the Babylonian, Greek, and Syrian rites for the dead in this month, and the opening of the gate of the nether sea for the dead to arise (p. 1os, n. 2) corresponds to the Roman mundus patet, 'the earth is open', of the Roman calendar on August 24.3 Also on October 5 and November 8 the souls arose from a pit on the Palatine Hill, which was closed by a lapis manalis, 'stone of the manes', removed on those days. All these rites have survived in the Christian calendar, November 2, All Souls' Day. There is a Babylonian commentary devoted to Teshrit4 which begins with an omen. 'If in Teshrit one demolishes a house in a city and its brick wall is laid [his god will lead him in prosperity].s In Teshrit rises the star ofNinmah, the child-bearing'.6 The commentary apparently refers to a drawing of Libra beneath the border of which comments on words were written and the text. Teshrit is then explained as the 'month of the families', i.e. of family feast for the dead, and Libra is called the 'balancer', governing the time of the equinox. One is forbidden to make a kunsag,

or 'his god who has fallen into ruin', in Teshrit.2 If fire falls on a house in Teshrit the gods will despise the king of the land.l On the 2gth one may not go out of the gate. Teshrit is the month ofthe heroic Shamash, when Libra rises, and here the 'dark star' Saturn is mentioned as the star of Shamash. Then the mortuary sacrifices are made to the Anunnaki (gods of the lower world). The month is sacred to 'the king of the Dukug', grandfather of Enlil, who is the water-god Ea. It appears, then, that in genuine Sumerian tradition it was Ea who sat in the Holy Chamber in the month Dukug and not Enlil. It calls for remark that in the late period the New Year festivals whether in the spring or autumn both cover eleven days at Babylon in Nisan, at Erech in Teshrit. This is undoubtedly due to the astronomical discovery in the late period that the lunar year of 354 days is eleven days short of the solar year 365 days. The Assyrian menologies could not have known this, for there the period is seven days of fasting and two days of festivity. The Jewish period, days I-I o inclusive ending with the Day ofAtonement, may have been based upon the I I -day epact ofBabylonia. The eleven days of the epact were known to the Assyrians, as the following text of the seventh century proves.4

AYAR, SIVAN, TAMMUZ, AB, ELUL
1\ KY previous lecture explained how both Sumerians and
l VJ. Babylonians divided the year into two equal parts of six months each; how at the beginning of each halfin Nisan and Teshrit they had New Year festivals and the seasons of penance, for eleven days at the beginning of each; the Hebrews on taking this system over kept their old beginning of the year in Teshrit and adopted the same season of penance. I shall now describe the five months of the first half of the Babylonian year, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Ayar, Sivan, Tammuz, Ab, Elul. Seep. rg. AYAR (April-May), or the second month after the spring equinox, the Sumerians of Nippur named gusisa, running from about April 15th to May 15th normally. gusisa means probably 'festival of the procession of the oxen'. When the constellation Orion (star of Tammuz) rose in this month the god of vegetation and flocks is said to have married the Earth-goddess. The month gil-si-sd1 was also an intercalary month in Sumerian.2 At ancient Lagash the name of this month was gil-du-izi-mu-a d.Nina-ka, but the name of the goddess of canals and fish, Nina, is often omitted.3 In the age of Sargon of Agade gil-du-izi-mu-mu is usual.4 In the late Sumerian period gdr for gud, bull, is common,s alongside gil-ta-izi-mu-mu6 and gil-du-mu-mu.1 Both at Nip

pur and Lagash the second month was, therefore, named after some ceremony with oxen, and at Nippur certainly a procession (alpe ultesseru) of oxen as the calendar and commentaries prove. The Lagash name originally was the month 'the oxen-izi-mu of the goddess Nina'.I The izimumu ceremony refers to torch-processions in the month Tammuz.2 Hence at Lagash the name seems to mean 'oxen of the torch (procession) in honour of the goddess Nina'.3 At Ur the month was known as SES-da-ku or DUN-da-ku,4 a festival of eating some animal, and in this month fell the ezen gu-si-su or 'festival of the procession of oxen',s on days 12, 20, 21, with sacrifices of cows and oxen to Enlil and Ninlil, and on the 21st a sacrifice on behalf of the mother of the Enlils. In the same month at Nippur fell the ezenga(n)-si6 to the 'queen of the brides', certainly referring to the divine marriage in Ayar. And there was a gate at Nippur known as 'gate of the king who conducts the oxen'.7 The Nippurian name was finally adopted in all Sumerian provinces and throughout Babylonia, and was translated into Accadian by a-ja-rum, s a-a-ru,9 in early Assyrian a-ri, Io ja-ri,n Jewish 'jjar, the form also used in Syrian Arabic, 12 Aramaic 'jar; at Heliopolis the Greek transcription in the

112 THE TAMMUZ-ISHTAR CYCLE OF MONTHS
Christian period was larar, Arar.1 Since the Sumerian si-sa means !ute!uru, to go in procession, the Accadian Ayaru is
almost certainly derived from the verb aru, 'to go on a way'.2 The Accadians, therefore, by this word were rendering the salient aspect of the Sumerian festival for this month. A neo-Babylonian book of special instructions contains the following comments on Ayar.3 Ayar is the month of Ningirsu the high priest of Enlil, the month when one drives oxen in procession.4 On the second day at the time of repose (sunset) Nabu is clothed in a garment of divine power for the marriage festivaLs He then goes in procession6 to the temple E!Jurlaba and enters before the divine princess (his wife Tashmet)7 where all is prepared for the marriage, and there on a bed they sleep. On the sixth day Nabu goes forth into a garden. On the seventh he proceeds in processions to a chapel in Eanna, temple of the virgin goddess Ishtar, a survival of an older marriage ofTammuz and lshtar. Again he descends into a garden of Anu and sits down. 'Since he has taken over the kingship of Anu and completed (the marriage ceremony)'. On the seventeenth Nana hastens from her temple E!Jurlaba and proceeds in processions to a garden. In this text the divine marriage of Ayar in Babylonia was that of Nabu and Tashmet and was held on days 2-6, and that of Tammuz and Ishtar on days 7-17. Reference is then made to rituals of Enlil in 1 Hemerologium Florentinum and Leiden manuscript in Benfey, Monatsnamen, 21-2; x68. Seep. 66. 2 "'I'M, as Delitzsch, H. W. 50 wrote.

AYAR 113
Nippur. Ayar was, therefore, originally the month of a marriage festival in the old Sumerian cities, at Nippur and Lagash almost certainly of Ningirsu and Bau. This ceremony is also described in two Assyrian letters. One is addressed to the 'son of the king'. 'On the third of Ayar in Calah thou shalt prepare the bed of Nabu. Nabu will enter into the house of the (bridal) bed. On the fourth day is the return ofNabu.'I The writer then says that Nabu will go out of the adru2 of the palace (ekallu) into the garden where sacrifices are to be made. The chariot driver of the godsJ comes to bringNabu away from thegardenandcauses him to enter again into (his temple). The charioteer then departs. According to this letter the divine marriage occurred on the night between days 3 and 4, after which there was a procession to and from a garden. Another letter• addressed to the king states that on thefourth ofAyar during daylight toward evenings Nabu and Tashmet enter the sleeping-chamber. From the fifth to the tenth Nabu and Tashmet remain in their bridal chamber.6 The chiefminister (on guard ofthe chamber) must kneel and Nabu departs on the eleventh and goes to the park (ambassu), where he slays wild bulls and lions. He then returns to his throne-room (!ubtu).

Apparently the nuptials take place in the palace. 7 KAR. I 78 IV 59· Q.

almanac forbids marriage on the fifth, I but the old meno
logy seems to allow it. On the fifteenth a prisoner was released;2 and another Assyrian letter3 describes the fifteenth as te-bi suklulu 'the going up of the procession is finished'' and the eighteenth as the day ~atam pu!ur for which the almanac has za~attam pu!ur,4 both obscure references to the completion of the ceremony. Ayar or 'month of the marriage procession' corresponds to the Roman April under the protection of Venus (tutela Veneris). If this ceremony of a divine marriage found its way into Italy it would explain the Veneralia of April 1 at Rome, when patrician women prayed to the chaste Venus (Verticordia) and the poor to Fortuna Virilis who gives good luck with men; then they bathed in men's baths and gave themselves over to general licentiousness, a custom which seems to have come to Italy from Cyprus.s The myth is surely the real explanation of why April in Rome and Europe became the month most favourable for marriages. This is also the time of the great feast of Arteinis in the Attic calendar, the month Mounichion corresponding to Arteinisios in the Macedonian year. The Babylonians assigned Ayar to Ningirsu, god ofirrigation and a local form of Tammuz at Lagash; his consort Bau-Gula is also frequently identified with lshtar. Consequently the ceremony of 'giving bread' to Gula on the twelfth,6 or the day after the marriage ceremony was completed according to one source,7 must be connected with this ritual. An Assyrian scribe informed the king that he Inight do anything he desires on Ayar 10, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, all of which are favourable for worship of god. The

commentary on Ayar1 has 'Ayar is the month of the Pleiades,2 the seven great gods, time of the opening of the earth. The oxen go in procession.3 The water-sluices are opened.4 The water-wheels are flooded. Month of the heroic Ningirsu, great priest-king of Enlil.' It is difficult to understand then why the Assyrians assigned this month to
the water-god 'Ea,lordofthe peoples',s unless it was because they had assigned the Pleiades to the stars of the Ea way.6 Since the myth of Ayar is of early Sumerian origin, as proved by the name at Nippur, any connexion with the stars must be sought in the constellations governing Ayar in the Taurus period. The principal constellation would be Orion.7 Orion was in fact identified with Tammuz and Ninsubur (a type ofTammuz), but the myth here refers to Tammuz as the slain god in the month Tammuz. Ovid began his poem on April:
Alma, fave, dixi, geminorum mater amorum,
' "0 fruitful mother of the twin loves", said I, "grant me thy favour" ', and he derived Aprilis from Aphrodite. SIVAN (May-June) in the Nippurian calendar was named s£g-u-1ub-ba-gar,8 'month when the brick is made in the mould', and is the only one of the cycle of months 2-6 which was not based upon the Tammuz-lshtar cult. The calendar of the Sumerian city Umma has this name as the second month ofa year beginning with Adar.9 Sargon ofAssyria described

On the fifteenth a prisoner was released;z and another Assyrian letterl describes the fifteenth as te-hi !uklulu 'the going up of the procession is finished', and the eighteenth as the day ~atam pu!ur for which the almanac has za~attam pu!ur,4 both obscure references to the completion of the ceremony. Ayar or 'month of the marriage procession' corresponds to the Roman April under the protection of Venus (tutela Veneris). If this ceremony of a divine marriage found its way into Italy it would explain the Veneralia of April I at Rome, when patrician women prayed to the chaste Venus (Verticordia) and the poor to Fortuna Virilis who gives good luck with men; then they bathed in men's baths and gave themselves over to general licentiousness, a custom which seems to have come to Italy from Cyprus.s The myth is surely the real explanation of why April in Rome and Europe became the month most favourable for marriages. This is also the time of the great feast of Artemis in the Attic calendar, the month Mounichion corresponding to Artemisios in the Macedonian year. The Babylonians assigned Ayar to Ningirsu, god ofirrigation and a local form of Tammuz at Lagash; his consort Bau-Gula is also frequently identified with Ishtar. Consequently the ceremony of 'giving bread' to Gula on the twelfth,6 or the day after the marriage ceremony was completed according to one source,7 must be connected with this ritual. An Assyrian scribe informed the king that he might do anything he desires on Ayar IO, IS, I6, I8, 20, 22, 24, 26, all of which are favourable for worship of god. The

commentary on Ayar1 has 'Ayar is the month of the Pleiades,2 the seven great gods, time of the opening of the earth. The oxen go in procession.3 The water-sluices are opened.4 The water-wheels are flooded. Month of the heroic Ningirsu, great priest-king of Enlil.' It is difficult to understand then why the Assyrians assigned this month to the water-god 'Ea,lordofthe peoples',s unless it was because they had assigned the Pleiades to the stars of the Ea way.6 Since the myth of Ayar is of early Sumerian origin, as proved by the name at Nippur, any connexion with the stars must be sought in the constellations governing Ayar in the Taurus period. The principal constellation would be Orlon.7 Orion was in fact identified with Tammuz and Ninsubur (a type ofTammuz), but the myth here refers to Tammuz as the slain god in the month Tammuz. Ovid began his poem on April:
Alma, fave, dixi, geminorum mater amorum,
' "0 fruitful mother of the twin loves", said I, "grant me thy favour" ', and he derived Aprilis from Aphrodite. SIVAN (May-June) in the Nippurian calendar was named s£g-u-sub-ba-gar,8 'month when the brickis made in the mould', and is the only one of the cycle of months 2-6 which was not based upon the Tammuz-Ishtar cult. The calendar of the Sumerian city Umma has this name as the second month ofa year beginning withAdar.9 Sargon ofAssyria described

1 I6 THE TAMMUZ-ISHTAR CYCLE OF MONTHS
Sivan as the month when he caused bricks to be made. I At Ur the Sumerians named the third month (old style) u-be-2 mu1en-ku, 'month of the eating of the ube bird, or u-be-mu1enmu, 'month of sacrificing the ube bird'.3 At Ur this month had a ceremony of eating the SES-da (some animal) on the first day, and consequently the month of eating the ube bird began with a ceremony which gave its name to the second month.4 At Lagash the third month was known as 'the festival of the god Negun'.s The scribes define Negun as a
title of the War-god Ninurta,6 probably a title used at KesOpis, and also say that Negun was 'Lord of the city, (his) name at Nippur'.7 In the myth of Sivan Negun was the Fire-god by whose assistance bricks were made, and the scribes also explained his name as meaning the Fire-god who consumes the offerings.s But at Nippur the Fire-god was Nusku, a title of the Moon-god,9 and consequently the Assyrians (certainly copying from Babylonian) said that Sivan was sacred to the Moon-god, Sin, first-born son of Enlil. Io The official list erroneously identified u-be-mu1en-ku with the month Tammuz, and its authors, not knowing the old name of Ayar at Ur, inserted an Assyrian name for Sivan, $i-i-ta!. We do not know where the Assyrians obtained this name, but it is certainly Sivan; for Sargon of Assyria says that the month $£ta1 is the month of the son of Enlil,I I the decider of decisions, who causes signs of light

to be seen,1 (month of) Nannar of heaven and earth, hero of the gods, god Sin, and this month was called 'month of the god of bricks', by the decree ofAnu, Enlil, and Ea, and it was the month for baking bricks, for building cities and houses.2 In this month there was a festival to Nabu, the scribe who wrote on clay tablets, baked by the god offire.J The third month at Nippur was, therefore, sacred to the Moon-god as the deity who had bestowed upon mankind the priceless gift of fire. That it should be especially connected with brick-making and writing on clay tablets is entirely explicable by the fact that the baked brick was the only means of building and means of writing in Sumer and Accad. The rituals of this month commemorated the supreme gift of the gods to man. In the civilization of the Sumerians and Babylonians the baked brick was absolutely indispensable; for stone does not exist in that land. On the 25th of Sivan there was a procession of Belit of Babylon,4 who has no connexion at all with the myth of this month; for it occurs on the 25th of all months. As to the Roman calendar, where June corresponds to Sivan, the principal ceremony was the Vestalia, June g, the celebration of Vesta, goddess of household fires. The period June 5-I 4, until the temple of Vesta was cleansed on the 15th, was nefast in Rome, when no marriages could take place. The Vestalia was clearly a fire cult, and since it fell in the same month as that sacred to the Fire-god in Sumer and Babylonia there may well be a connexion here. Borrowing may be excluded by the fact that in Sumer the deity is a male and in Rome a female. As to the Accadian rendering of stg-u-sub-ba-gar, 'monthor time ofbrick-making', by si-ma-nu,si-man-nu,s this

word may mean nothing more than the ordinary word simanu, 'fixed season', season (of brick-making). It passed into Hebrew and Aramaic as s£ran, Sivan; Greek, Seiouan. In Syria in the Roman period at Heliopolis a name for Sivan was retained in the calendar, Ezer, Ozir, the ijaziran of Syriac,1 'month of the Boar (Star)'. The Assyrian commentary on Sivan falsely assigned Taurus to Sivan in mythology and has 'Sivan is the month of Taurus, the tablet star,2 crown of Anu. That star is like the Fire-god.J Month of the brick mould of the king. The king shall bake (bricks) of the mould. The lands shall build their houses. Month of the "god of bricks" (Kulla) of the Land.'• Here the myth of the Fire-god is connected with Taurus, regent of Nisan in the Sumerian period. The regnal star ofthe 'month of brick-making' in the Aries period was Sirius, together with Gemini and Cancer. In fact Sirius was identified with Girra the Fire-gods and with Ninurta,6 who was in fact also known under the title Negun, god ofthis month at Lagash. It was natural that the Fire-god should be identified with theJavelin Star, Sirius,' which 'glows like copper'.8 The menologies ofboth the tenth9 and seventh10 centuries are well preserved and reveal no trace of a festival in Sivan nor worship of Sirius. The Greek festivals of Prometheus (Promethia) and Hephaistus (Hephaistia), characterized by renewing household fires by torches lighted at the altar of the Fire-god, seems to have no parallel in the rites of Sivan. This month was lucky for doing most things according to

the calendars, especially for beginning work on buildings, repairing houses, &c. One could clean his garments, recite a penitential psalm, make offering to god, sell grain, but not build a tomb in Sivan. The king could take part in the temple rituals in this month, and it was lucky for marriages. In the month Qa;:.iran the ~abeans at Harran celebrated a mystery on the 27th to the god Shemal and the god who shoots with the arrow, who can hardly be other than Ninurta (Nimrod), god of the Javelin Star. They also placed offerings in seven portions on a table to the seven gods (= sibitti iliini), certainly the Pleiades in Taurus. The priest then shot an arrow to which was attached a firebrand made of inflammable wood which whizzed like a rocket. 1 There is, here, surely in the Middle Ages a heritage of the ancient Sumerian worship of the Fire-god and his constellation Sirius, the Javelin or Arrow Star. Ninurta, god of Sirius, was in fact known as bum#ru, the boar, and consequently the Syriac name ofSivan can be nothing more than a survival of a cult of Sirius or Ninurta as the Boar Star.2 TAMMUZ (June-July),or the fourth month, the Sumerians at Nippur named su-numun,3 a name also adopted at Lagash from theAgade period onward and universallyused inBabylonia and Assyria (after the fourteenth century).4 Also !u-senumun occurs,s and since se-numun is the ordinary word for 'seed corn', this name describes this midsummer season as having to do with seed corn, and possibly the time of threshing. se-numun, 'seed', is also used for 'offspring'.6 The

month is also called Ju-ninda-numun-a, 1 a phrase containing the words 'bread of seed corn'. The Sumerians at U r (old style) has ki-sig- d.Nin-a-;:.u, 'month of the breaking of bread to the god Ninazu', a ceremony described at Lagash by e;:.en su-numun, 'feast of the ... seed corn'.2 But Ninazu 'lord of healing' is a title of Tammuz after his death and as god in the lower world, hence also of Nergallord of the land of the dead.l Moreover, the Nippurian itisu-numun-na was rendered by Du-u-;:.u, month of Tammuz,4 which passed into the Jewish calendar as month Tammiiz, into Aramaic as T-m-w-z (Tamiiz).s Hence in the 'month of seed corn', or 'bread of seed corn', the Accadians learned of a feast (of breaking of bread) for Tammuz, lord of life, who died in midsummer. It is, therefore, almost certain that sunumun at Nippur meant the month of breaking bread made from corn, a festival which survived in this month among the ~abeans of Harran. In the middle of the month Tammuz fell their celebration Bu~at, 'wailing' by weeping women in honour of Ta'uz. They then ate nothing ground in the mill, but only soaked wheat, chick-peas, dates, and raisins.6 The same celebration was maintained by the Nabateans.7 A late Babylonian calendar of special instructions says that Tammuz was a month of lamentation (te-kil-[ti]), month of

the binding of the god [Tammuz] when wailing was instituted (rikis sipitti), 1 and an omen taken from the sheep's liver says that if a certain sign on it occurs in this month 'the god of man will seek offerings for the dead Tammuz'.2 The old Assyrian menology orders weeping and liturgies for the second day,J and the Babylonian almanac says that on the 10th there is to be mourning; it is a day of trouble and gloom,"' when one might not go out into a street.s On the gth there was a procession of torches, and on the 17th a procession with torches was held when the king made offering to the 'Lord of Cutha', or Nerga1.6 This agrees with the middle of the month as the time of the Tammuz wailing as retained by the 1;iabeans, and the Jewish fast on the 17th was obviously taken from the Babylonian calendar. The Jews latterly explained the sorrowful rites of the 17th as a day of mourning for the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in A.D. 70.7 The Phoenicians also had a month Marzeab 'feast of mourning', which was undoubtedly the same as the Babylonian Tammuz.s When John of Gischala fought the last battle for the Jewish state at the siege of Jerusalem daily sacrifice was abandoned on the 17th of Panemos (Tammuz). In Babylonia the god Tammuz was said to have descended to the lower world on the I 8th ofTammuz and to have risen on the 28th of Kislev (December).9 Another passage in the same

text1 seems to date· the descent of Tammuz on the 1Ith, corresponding to the Babylonian almanac's direction for wailing on the 1oth. Josephus also places the Adonis (Tammuz) wailings in the fourth month2 and says: 'In the month June the lover of Venus, and a most beautiful youth, is said to have been slain and straightway to have lived again; this same month they call by the same name (Tammuz), and they celebrate an annual solemn ceremony for him in which he is wailed by womenJ as one dead and afterward he is hymned and praised as one who lives again.' Two almanacs of the Seleucid period describe the 18th of Tammuz as a 'day of terror (gilittum) of the road', describing the descent of the dead god on this day.4 The Assyrian commentarys on this month reads: 'Tammuz is the month of the constellation Orion, him that was smitten by weapons, which is the month of Ninsubur or Papsukkal, far-famed messenger of Anu. Month when seed corn is stored, and the early seed corn is brought forth. There is wailing for the god Ninrurugu. Month when Tammuz the shepherd is bound.' Here Orion (in the Aries period regnal stars ofSivan6) is falsely assigned to the fourth month, because, as star of Ayar in the Taurus period, Orion had been identified with the shepherd Tammuz in the marriage with Ishtar. Ninsubur is the title ofTammuz here, and since Ninsubur is a special aspect of Ninurta and an earlier name for him,7 the Assyrians held this month to be sacred to the 'heroic Ninurta'.s It is clear from the commentary that the old Sumerian name refers to the season when seed corn was stored and loaned for the next season.9

Thename may be purelyagricultural and byorigin may have no connexion with the Tammuz wailings, as did the name atUr. nu-mu-un-e, 'theseed', 'offspring',isatitleofTammuz;1 despite the commentary and the usual meaning of numun, it is possible that sunumun actually refers to Tammuz. The Accadian calendar of Elam described this month as the time when the gates of hell were opened for the descent of the dying god,2 and the early Assyrian name refers to Tammuz as the shepherd.J A fragmentary passage on a day of this month (number broken away) has, '... let one announce his glad tidings; [a prisoner] he shall release and so the mouth which curses him will bless him.'4 It is probable that the lamentations for Adonis in Greece also occurred in July. Plutarch is the authority for this, and whatever be the arguments which classical scholars adduce for a time in autumn when flowers were thrown into the sea at Athens, symbolic of the dead Adonis, they must reckon with the facts of the Babylonian, Aramaic, and Hebrew calendars. The cult came to Greece from Syria, and it is incredible that the time of the yearly wailings were not the same unless climatic conditions caused it to be placed later in the year. AB (July-August), the fifth month, has been discussed in the first lecture,swhere the name was chosen to prove how the Babylonian month-names were only translations or general renderings of the Sumerian names. After the season of wailing for Tammuz came the feasts of torches, funeral meals for the dead god, and families entertained the ghosts of their dead relatives at the parentalia. The midsummer fires signified the decline of the sun from the solstice, and this was the ceremony on which the Nippurian name izi

or day of the Hebrew festival of the wood-bearers, was the date of the rising of the Bow Star, Canis Major;1 in another text it rises on the 5th.2 These dates have been connected with the Persian Sacaea on Loos (=Ab) the x6th.J The old menology has a long entry against day xg. There was a ceremony of plunging in the river, a mystery, and a cere
mony for overcoming an adversary by placing a pasu ofclay, on which was written the accuser's name, in coriander and casting it into the river. The 20th was a day ofsorrow when one might not cross a river, and the 25th a day of griefwhen an image of the ghost of a father was made; a prayer was said over it confessing the dead father's sins, evidently to avoid the visiting of the sins of the ancestors on the living. There are long directions for purifying the living against the sins committed by any one of the family; these rituals of lustration on Ab 25 are similar to the lustrations by bathing on St. John's Day.4 On the 26th one might not go near any woman, but he must pour out water to the souls of the dead (the Anunnaki) in the garden. If a man ate any fowl on this day he would die by headache and fever.s The regnal star of Ab in the Aries period was Canis Major (excluding Sirius), said to be the constellation of the Elamitic lshtar, daughter of Enlil,6 and of Ishtar of BabyIon.7 The rising of this constellation in Ab was the festival of the 'honoured queen, daughter of Enlil', that is lshtar of Arbela;s Ab is also described as the month of the Bow Star and month of the mighty daughter of Sin (i.e. Ishtar).9 If the date Ab 15 be assumed as the time of the rising of Canis, then this festival of Ishtar fell on the same date as the Jewish festival of bringing wood for the altar.

126 THE TAMMUZ-ISHTAR CYCLE OF MONTHS
festival of Ishtar of Arbela at Milkia1 is also called 'festival of the goddess Shatri',2 celebrated in the b£t ak£ti. ELuL (September), the sixth month, was known in the Nippurian calendar as the ezen-kin-d-Jnnini, 'festival of the sending or mission of Ishtar',3 and is undoubtedly based upon the myth of Ishtar's descent into Arallu to seek for the dead Tammuz. This month ends the great TammuzIshtar cycle, Ayar the marriage, Tammuz, death of the young god, Ab, time of funeral offerings to him when he sleeps in the lower world, and Elul, time of the descent of his lover Ishtar. At Ur this month was known as akiti,4 or month of the New Year festival, which seems to have been shoved out of its place as the seventh month originally to make way for a festival to the emperor Dungi, a name given to the seventh month in the late period. The fact is that the original Ur calendar is unknown.s That the celebration of Ishtar's mission at Ur fell in Akiti is proved by a tablet dated on the 11th of this month when sacrifices were brought for the 'festival of the mission of lnnini',6 for Anu and lnnini; followed by sacrifices to Allatum, queen of hell. The Sumerians at Lagash named this same month 'the festival of Tammuz',7 wherefore the Nippur name 'festival

of the mission of Ishtar (= Innini)' must be interpreted as having to do with the Tammuz myth. It is not entirely certain that the ceremony of this month refers to the descent of Ishtar, but my argument is based upon the certain fact that the ceremony contained a ritual of the purification of Ishtar. kin in Sumerian means lipru, mission, work to be done, and the scribes said that Elul was the li-pir iltariiti, 'month of the mission (or ceremony?) of the Ishtars', or on a variant 'month·of the mission of Ishtar'. I But the Sumerian commentary on Elul has: 'Elul is (the month of) the Bow Star (Spica) of Ishtar, the Elamite, the mother-Ishtars cleanse themselves in the river, yearly she washes herself.'2 The Accadian rendering is: 'Elul is the month of the mission of Ishtar, the Elamite; the Ishtars cleanse3 themselves in the river, yearly theywash themselves.'4 The legend of the bathing of Ishtar in a fountain in Dilmun is referred to in Sumerian texts. 'I washed (my) head in the fountain of the mountain of Dilmun', she said of herself;s she bathed where the sun rises and washed herself in the flood of the river,6 and at the well of washing, in the well she washed her head.7 But, when Ishtar descended by the seven gates of hell to seek for Tammuz, Ereshkigal queen of Arallu ordered her messenger Namtaru to wash her with the waters oflife before she was sent back to earth.s Since the Accadians regarded the principal ceremony of

128 THE TAMMUZ-ISHTAR CYCLE OF MONTHS
'the mission of Ishtar' as one of purification, they rendered the Sumerian name by Elulu, 'month ofpurification',1 deriving this noun from the same verb that the Accadians used in 'the Ishtars cleanse themselves in the river'. Elulu, then, refers to the purification of the virgin Ishtar, and it is difficult to decide whether it refers to a ceremony based on the poem of her descent to Arallu or to the myth ofher bathing in the sacred land Dilmun. There is a parallel myth in Greek concerning Hera who bathed yearly in a spring at Nauplia to recover her virginity after her marriage with Zeus.z Perhaps this is the reason for the yearly purification oflshtar in Elul after her marriage with Tammuz in Ayar. Aelianl preserves a similar Syrian story that Hera bathed at the source of the Habur (in northern Mesopotamia) after marriage with Zeus, which surely, as a Syrian legend, refers to Adad and Atargatis:~ Elul corresponds to the Roman mensis sextilis, and the important festival of that month on the Ides (13th) is that ofDianae in Aventina or SacrumDeanae.s This was a Roman holiday for slaves; the Roman women washed their heads,6 a custom which surely refers to the purification of Diana or Artemis. The Assyrians, in rendering the idea of the myth of the mission of Ishtar, chose the name 'month of the queen of the palace', referring to Ishtar as queen in Arallu,7 and this provides the principal argument for supposing that the Sumerian8 and Assyrian poems on the descent of Ishtar were recited as part of the ritual of Elul.

Elul was sacred to Ishtar, queen of the lands,1 and the tenth-century menology2 orders the king to make offerings to heron days 10, 12, 13, 14, IS, 16, 27. On thegthhemustmake offerings to Ea, the Water-god, and to the River-goddess. The River-goddess appears only here in the menologies and probably refers to the myth of the bathing of Ishtar. Elul passed into Hebrew as Elul, and for the Aramaic and Syriac forms see p. 65. Of the myth and festival of this month no trace has survived in the Hebrew and Aramaic calendars. The $abeans had a ceremony of washing themselves secretly on the srd of Elul in honour of their chief god Shemal. On the 26th they worshipped Sun and Venus, and on the 27th and 28th there were offerings to Shemal and the demons. 3
B. CYCLE OF AUTUMN AND WINTER MONTHS
I come now to the five months which constitute the parallel part of the second half of the year, months 8, g, 10, I 1, 12. Arahsamna following Teshrit is roughly November; we now enter the period when the Sun-god descends toward the winter darkness. He now becomes lord of the land of the dead, and the descending Sun-god controls the myths of the following months until the winter solstice. In November fall the autumn rains and the ploughing season begins. Therefore the Sumerians of Nippur named the eighth month apin-dii-a, 'opening (the soil) with the plough'.4 apin, Accadian epinnu, plough, is also rendered by nar_tabu, water-machine, shadoufs At Ur the name which seems to

Month ofAdad, great bull ofheaven and earth.'J Arahsamna is held to be sacred to the Rain and Thundergod, since this is the season of November rains, and there was a festival to celebrate the opening of the soil with the plough. The Accadian text has a reference to 'the unbinding of the band' (pa-tar mird£ti); now the menologies for this month for days 6, 16, 26 refer to a custom of releasing a debtor or a prisoner. 'The sixth day is lucky. (The king) shall recite a penitential psalm. Before he enters for the psalm a person pledged for debt as a substitute4 for silver let him ransom and his heart will be glad.' 'On the sixteenth one shall [not eat] dates and so shall that man become old. (The king) shall recite a penitential psalm; he shall manumit a slave; he shall release a prisoner (kasti) and so shall his trouble [be unbound].'s 'On the twenty-sixth let him (the king) bow down to Sin; his food-offering he shall not set forth, or there will be seizing by the "mountain of god". He shall recite a penitential psalm; let him release a prisoner or he will come to harm.'6 These texts generally use lip-fur, 'let him release', in the injunction for releasing a prisoner, which leads one to infer that the commentary means to describe Arahsamna as the month when a prisoner was released by the phrase 'unbinding of the band'.7 The custom of releasing a prisoner also

occurs on the 16th of Adar,1 and on some day in Tammuz (date broken away).2 There is no explanation as to why Arahsamna should be chosen especially for this ceremony unless there was some myth concerning the release of Tammuz then. TheJewish customfell at the Passover,Nisan 1422, and is mentioned in the New Testament at the trial of Jesus by Pilate. For said Pilate, 'Ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the Passover',3 No similar law is mentioned in Hebrew.4 The Babylonians assigned this month to ap~alli ilani a.Marduk, 'the sage of the gods, Marduk',s who in this connexion is also described as bel na#i 'lord of the deep'.6 The myth of this month was clearly connected with the underworld sea, the apsu over which Ea, god of fresh water, presided. Ea, father of Marduk, has the title 'lord of the deep',7 and was patron god of farmers (ikkaru).8 The season

is, therefore, assigned to the deities who preside over springs which flow from the nether world sea, which again shows the agricultural nature of the myth of the month. If any suggestion of a myth can be obtained from the regnal stars ofArahsamna in the Taurus period resort must be made to Capricorn, Pegasus, and Sagittarius.1 Nergal was god of Mars whose hypsoma was in Capricorn and also god of Pegasus. Sagittarius was identified with Ninurta,2 lord of Larak and administrator of the underworld.3 The Sumerian ceremonies in this month must have been so uninteresting that they made no impression upon the Accadians and they rendered the name by the colourless word Aray-samna, 'Eighth month' simply.4 This word passed into post-exilic Hebrew as Maryesviin,s and into late Hebrew in the same form; the SeptuagintGreekhasMarsouanes. The Aramaic people refused to employ this colourless word and adhered to the name Kinun, Kanun,6 already in use by the Accadians when the Sumerian calendar was translated in the Hammurabi period. The persistence of the use of the word Kinun in Aramaic lands led me to infer in my first lecture that it is of Aramaic origin. Now it is certain that the characteristic ceremonies ofArahsamna, Kislev (December), and Tebit (January) in the Babylonian calendar are based upon the kinunu or 'hearth-fires'. The word is not only good Aramaic but also widely used in Accadian. It may, in fact, be derived from Sumerian gunni,7 the regular word for kinunu. On the eighteenth of Arahsamna, a day sacred to Shamash, two kinunu, braziers, were covered and set before the sons ofBel, i.e. Adad and Shamash.8 Another

brazier was covered in the chapel of Esagila, temple of Marduk in Babylon, and there were song-services by the psalmists.I On the twenty-fifth, sacred to Zamama of Kish, a cow was slain before a kettledrum and fire placed in a brazier.2 On this day no one might go out into the street.l On the ninth of Kislev, a day sacred to the god Shar~arbi (Nergal), two braziers were covered with a mourner's garment.4 On Kislev seventeenth, sacred to Nabu, two braziers of cedar were covered in the chapeLs On Kislev twentysecond, sacred to U rash (Ninurta), a brazier was clothed with a mourner's garment.6 On Tebit tenth fire was put in braziers to Bel (Marduk), Ninurta, Nabu, Ninsubur, Nergal, and Namtar; with them was set a brazier on a censer to Ishtar of Erech.7 In Assyria a bull was slaughtered to Nabu on days sixteen and seventeen of Tebit, and a brazier was set forth on the nineteenth.s Hence during the winter months November, December, January the late menologies have ceremonies with the brazier, and in all places the word is written in Sumerian, gunni. Assuming that this custom is of Sumerian origin, which would be proved if the Accadian name Kinunu was based upon Sumerian rites for the month of ploughing (apin-di1-a), then the widely spread Aramaic preference of this name to Arahsamna is due to myths and rituals which for them seemed the essential feature in the calendar for the eighth month. Kinun b£ti, 'brazier of the house', was a household deity and explained by 'house of the protecting genius'.9 No trace of a ritual of the hearth-fire has been found in Sumerian. The reader is left to weigh the arguments as to whether this name and the rituals came into Babylonian with the Ara

maic invasion and kinilnu was then rendered into Sumerian by KI-NE 'place of fire' and pronounced gunni after kinilnu, or whether the word and rituals were of Sumerian origin.I In Arahsamna, then, began the rites of covering the brazier on certain days of the winter months in sign of mourning for the waning Sun-god. Now the hearth-fires were lighted, and the genius of the hearth now presided over the homes of men. Worship of the Lares or household gods has probably survived in the ~abean rites of Second Teshrit (= Arahsamna), where for nine days, 21st to 2gth, they fasted to the rabb-al-ba!Jt, 'Lord of good luck'. They broke bread, mixed it with barley and myrrh, and strewed it throughout their houses, saying, '0 ye night-wanderers of good luck, here you have bread for your dogs, z barley and straw for your cattle, oil for your lamps, and myrrh for your garlands. Enter in peace and go out in peace and leave good reward for us and our children.'3 K!sLEV,4 the ninth month (Nov.-Dec.), was known at Nippur as kan-kan-e, the feast of lighting braziers, which fell on days g, 10, 17, 22 in the late Babylonian calendar. We come now to the darkest period of the year in which falls the winter solstice, the resurrection of Tammuz and the turning back of the Sun-god from the darkness of the lower world. The ninth month is almost entirely confined to rituals for the gods of the dead, ceremonies to the genius of the hearth-fires and the resurrection of Tammuz. The carrying of lights to hasten the return of the Sun-god and

The evidence and full investigation must be left to the critical edition of the texts.



136 CYCLE OF AUTUMN AND WINTER MONTHS
the passing of the winter's darkness is the salient feature of Kislev. The Sumerians at Lagash named it mu-!u-du (var. du), meaning probably 'month of carrying fire', and at Ur ez:,en-mag, 'month of the supreme festival', in which fell the 'feast of manifestation', nabrum,1 possibly meaning 'display oflights'. The Accadian rendering kislimu is obscure and its meaning unknown. The Jewish Church has also a feast of lights in Kislev, the lfanukka, instituted by Judas Maccabeus in 165 B.c. The lfanukka occurs on the 25th of Kislev or December in the present Jewish calendar. This festival is said to go back to Nehemiah, who served in the court of Artaxerxes. He restored the walls of Jerusalem and relit the altar fire in the temple in 445 B.c.,2 on Kislev 25. After the temple was again desecrated by Antiochus Epiphanes in 165 B.c. Judas Maccabeus again relit the altar fires on the 25th of Kislev. So was established in J udaism the lfanukka, feast of dedication, feast of purification, celebrated with lighted lamps. The Talmud calls this the feast of illumination, andJosephus says that it was the feast oflights.J Now the author of II Maccabees has two reasons for fixing this festival of lights on Kislev 25 in memory of the reconsecration of the temple and the relighting of the eternal altar fire. One is that Nehemiah, when he returned from the Exile in the fifth century, had chosen this date; another reason was that Antiochus had desecrated the temple on Kislev 25."' 'Bearing wands wreathed with leaves, fair boughs, and palms, they offered hymns ofpraise to him who had prospered the cleansing of his own place.' The Gospel ofJohn refers to this rehabilitation of the old feast oflights, 'Then was the feast of the dedication (encaenium) inJerusalem and it was winter'.s

KISLEV I37
The Jews, after the new institution in 162 B.c., celebrated the l:lanukka by placing lights at the doors of their houses, and these were held so sacred that none might read by them. The traditions vary as to the date, and some said that it was on the 15th of December or Kislev. But it is obvious that this post-exilic feast oflights in December must have been brought to Jerusalem by Nehemiah from Babylonia. Surely by his long residence in the Babylonian Exile Nehemiah knew the Church Calendar ofBabylonia. There he must have known that feasts of torches and braziers were characteristic of the season December. The Assyrian and Babylonian calendar orders worship of Nergal, god of the winter sun, on the 15th of Kislev, and then the celebrants bore palms, precisely as the Jews did at the l:lanukka on the 25th of Kislev. The Babylonians date the resurrection ofNergal or Tam· muz on the 27th or 28th of Kislev. The Nabateans celebrated the birth ofDusares on the 25th ofDecember. There is here a confusion of dates for the rebirth of the Sun-god at the winter solstice in ancient Semitic traditions. The month of Kislev is characterized by feasts of lights in the Sumerian and Babylonian calendar to celebrate the resurrection of the Sun-god and of Tammuz. This certainly gave the Jews the l:lanukka or feast of lights. The Church Calendars ofBabylonia offer daysg, 10, 15, 17,22 as a choice for these feasts but never the 25th. The astronomical texts offer the 28th. The Jews of the Exile certainly knew these dates, but why they and the Nabataeans fixed upon the 25th is not clear unless there is truth in the explanation that Nehemiah chose the 25th. The l:lanukka on the 25th of Kislev obviously influenced the early Christians to fix the birth of Christ on the 25th of December. The exact day is unimportant. The substance of the myth of the resurrection of Tammuz, the rebirth of the sun celebrated by the

feast oflights-these were the influences which gave Judaism its I;Ianukka and Christianity its Christmas Day. On this day the Sumerians recited the hymn:
0 Nergal, mighty one, at whose cry the closed door opens. 0 lord that comest by night, for whom the bolted doors open of themselves. 0 lord that comest by night, the child-bearing mother be dear to thee.
The Latin Christian hymns of the Nativity inherit the same spirit and traditions of remote antiquity:
Festa dies agitur Mundo salus redditur, In qua sol exoritur Qui mundum replet lumine.
The day is celebrated as a feast; &alvation is restored to the world; The day whereon the sun rises (again), Which fills the world with light.
In Kislev the homes and streets of Babylonian and Assyrian cities flamed with lights by night as Nergal, lord of the winter sun, ascended from the nether world, and his constellation Pegasus rose to govern the month of the winter solstice. At the same season in Greece, on the 8th of the month Poseidon, fell the festival Posidea, when cakes and wine were offered to the underworld deity Poseidon. In Kislev the Assyrian calendars repeatedly order ceremonies to hasten the return of the earth's fruitfulness. On the 1st of Kislev water was poured out before the cattle and a priest waved aloft a date-palm. On the 6th and 1sth water was poured out to Ereshkigal, goddess of the nether world, the Greek Demeter, and an old woman held aloft date-palms. On the 3oth bean-stalks were held above the heads of worshippers and prayers said to the great Earthgoddess. Now all these mystic rites of mid-winter to secure fruitful harvest and to encourage the resurrected Sun-god to goforth triumphantly for the blessing of mankind correspond pre



TEBIT 139
cisely to the Greek festival that fell on the 26th of the Attic month Poseidon. This Greek festival, the Haloa, feast of the garden, in honour of Demeter the Earth-goddess at the winter solstice had also mystic rites to ensure fruitful harvests. Apparently only women took part in the licentious mysteries at Eleusis at the Haloa1 in Greece, which corresponds to the direction of the Assyrian calendar for the 6th ofK.islev, when the rites are conducted by an old woman. The rites of Kislev, therefore, rest upon two principles: firstly the myth of the resurrection of the Sun-god celebrated with lights, which gave Judaism its feast of lights and Christianity its Noel or day of Nativity; secondly, the rites of sympathetic magic with palms, bean-stalks, and pouring ofwater before the cattle to ensure a fruitful harvest and to prevent drought. The Greeks had this second festival on the 26th of the month Poseidon. Whether there is borrowing ofan ancient Sumero-Babylonian mystic ritual here or whether the idea is a common heritage of both peoples, the fact remains that they chose the same season and almost the same day for the gay festival of the winter solstice. The gaiety of Christmas is inherited from the myth and magic of ancient peoples. TEBIT, the tenth month, roughly Dec.-Jan., was known in theSumeriancalendar ofNippur as theab-e(d),ortimewhen the elders of the city rise from the lower world. Ishum, the messenger of the gods, opens their gates of bondage and their ghosts return to sit in the council of the elders of the cities. The elders of the cities lamented during the whole month ofjanuary. At Ur the Sumerians named this month 'feast of heaven', and sacrificed to the Moon-god and the planet Venus. The Babylonians for some reason gave this month the name 'febttu, 'the month of the plunging (into water)', and they must have taken this description from some ritual which the Sumerians used for January. It is impossible to make any reasoned explanation of all these Sumerian myths and festivals for Tebit. Why so much 1 On the Haloa, see Deubner, Attische Feste, 6o-7.



140 CYCLE OF AUTUMN AND WINTER MONTHS
attention was paid to the cults of the Heaven-god, Venus, and the Moon in this mid-winter season cannot be explained. The Babylonians in the time of Ezekiel and Nehemiah had ceremonies with burning braziers on the 1oth ofTebit, and fires were lit before lshtar the goddess of Erech. On the 1oth of Tebit the Assyrian calendar orders offerings to the constellation Orion, which was now setting and entering its period of invisibility. The Babylonian almanac says that no one might enter a street on the 1oth ofTebit. Therefore the 10th ofTebit was the important day of this month in the Church calendar. Now Ezekiel in the ninth year of the first Babylonian captivity, i.e. in s88 B.C. prophesied on the lOth of Tebit (tenth month in the text) that Nebuchadnezzar wouldattackJerusalem on this sameday. 1 This is the actual date given by the Hebrew historians.2 The date was already marked as a national fast in the time of Zechariah (end of sixth century).J Since the sack of Jerusalem by Titus in A.D. 70, the 10th of Tebit has remained a fast-day in the Jewish calendar.4 The one thing certain about the tenth month is that it was extremely unlucky. The Babylonians called it 'the month of the curse'. A family might not leave a house or move into it in Tebit, nor could any repairs be made in a house in this month. No one might make a statue of a god, bring a gift to a god, set forth food-offerings, clean his garments, or recite a penitential psalm. Selling corn in Tebit was forbidden, marriages were doomed to failure in Tammuz (July), Elul (August), Kislev, and Tebit. A male child born in Tebit would be unfortunate. The two most unlucky months are Tammuz at the summer solstice and Tebit at the winter solstice, or months 4 and 10. This is undoubtedly due to the myths that Tarn

SHEBAT 141
muz died in July and the ghosts of the elders returned to earth during the whole ofJanuary. SHEBAT, the eleventh month, roughly February, has a purely agricultural name in the Nippurian calendar, zizan, 'month of emmer wheat', for which there is no explanation unless it refers to the blades which now spring from the earth with rains of February. The early Assyrian calendar describes this season as 'month of the orchards'.1 The Sumerians at Ur described it as 'month of the rain and the Storm-god'. In fact February is the season of storms and heavy rain in Mesopotamia, and after the Sumerian calendar had been adopted in Babylonia and Assyria, the eleventh month was always sacred to the god of storms. There is no myth in connexion with this month; only the emphasis upon the worship of the Storm-god among the Sumerians gave the Semites any clue to a word for this month. The Babylonians, therefore, called the eleventh month !abii!u, month of the blowing of storms, the month of winds and rain. Naturally they may have made up this name for themselves. There was no myth or festival to translate here. !abii!u passed into the Jewish and Aramaic calendars as !eba!, Greek sabat.
The calendars mark days 20, 24, 30 as of special importance. On the 2oth one might not drink any water, and must pray to Shamash the Sun-god. On the 24th one must stand on the bank of the river and pray to the Water-god (Ea); he might drink no wine on that day. On the 30th one must pray to the Storm-god and drink no Wine. Shebat was a lucky month for marriages, and here the Greek calendar has the same season for marriages, naming the month, in fact, Gamelion, 'the marrying-month'. Demons were particularly dangerous in February. This was an old Sumerian myth that the devils infest the homes and fields of man in Shebat; consequently the Accadians of the Elamitic province named this month buldubba-e, meaning
1 Seep. 39·



I42 CYCLE OF AUTUMN AND WINTER MONTHS
'0 loitering devil depart'. Jewish mythology inherited this same belief, and throughout the history of Judaism Shebat has always been a time when devils, demons, and all evil spirits are at large. AnAR, the twelfth month, corresponding roughly to March-April, was universally known in all Sumerian cities as the month ofbarley harvest; it ends with rising ofPleiades from 3000 to 500 B.c. This is a purely agricultural name. The Babylonians rendered the Sumerian name by Adaru, 'month of the threshing-floor', and so it passed into the Jewish calendar as Adar. At the end of each lunar year the Sumerians examined the condition of the cornfields. If by the annual loss of the eleven days, by which the lunar year lags behind the solar year and the seasons, Adar would fall too early for harvest, they inserted a 'former Adar' at the end of the year. By this system of inserting an intercalary Adar before and not after this month, the month of barley harvest was kept approximately in its season. The Sumerians always used this system. In the later Babylonian and Assyrian calendars they took no notice of what the name meant. Month of barley harvest might fall a whole month too early. Then arose the practice of inserting the extra Adar after it. The Sumerians seem to have had a ceremony of waving a sheaf of grain in this month to celebrate the time of putting the sickle to the corn. In the early calendar this festival of the harvest corresponds obviously to the Hebrew Nisan, when the first sheaf of the harvest was waved. 1 This was fixed by Ezekiel for the 14th ofNisan. Now began the seven days' feast ofunleavened bread lasting until the 2oth,z in the Hebrew Church Calendar. This festival was then combined with the Passover held on the same date.J Now it is extraordinary that the New Testament refers to the custom ofreleasing a prisoner at the Passover, Nisan 14-20, and the old Assyrian calendar says that the king must release
1 Lev. 23, I I, there combined with the (Passover) lamb, v. I2.
z Ex. I2, IS-20. 3 Num. g, I 1-I4.



ADAR 143
a prisoner on the 16th of Adar. 1 There seems to be here a remarkable parallel between the ancient Sumerian custom of celebrating the cutting of the first sheaf in Adar, and the same ancient Hebrew-Canaanite custom. Moreover the release of a prisoner at this time must have been an old Babylonian regulation introduced into the calendar of the harvest month before the tenth century. There is no particular myth associated with Adar in Sumerian except that the month was sacred to the god of wisdom and water, Ea. On the 13th of Adar the tenthcentury menology forbids eating fish and fowl, and on the octave of this day, the 20th, is another fast, when milk, flesh, and wine were forbidden and no one was allowed to wear anything to cover his hands. z The two fasts, seven days apart, covering the period 13-20 in the harvest month is suspiciously like the Hebrew regulation of the fast of unleavened bread from Nisan 14 to 20. There may be, then, a direct connexion between the Hebrew Passover and the Babylonian calendar. Confining the discussion to the Church Calendar of the late period which the post-exilic Hebrews obviously used, I finally note those days of the lunar month which have special names.

most of the ubulgallu days are also lucky days in both the old and reformed calendars; also the old' calendar from Nisan entries and Adar resume has nine of these days in each month and in Nisan every one of these is a rest-day except the 20th. In the seventh-century calendar ubulgallu is confined to the five rest-days which may be either lucky or unlucky. Hence ubulgallu or umu limnu must mean simply 'dangerous', day when the rules cannot be broken without incurring severe punishment. According to Harper, Lett. 23, 2I the uaulgalle day is la tabu, 'not good', and on this day no maJmaJu priest could say a prayer of the lifting of the hand.

It is clear fromK. 25I4, I4,!i-gu-uul i!essi(si) !ubat-su ul ubbab, (the king) 'shall not recite a psalm, he shall not clean his garments', that the two acts hang together and that when a !igu was forbidden, so was washing garments. The !igu in the old calendar occurs Nisan 6, I6, 27, 28; Sivan 6, I6 [28]; Elul 6, I6, 26, 28 with evil omen, since it was forbidden in Elul; Teshrit 28; Arahsamna 6, I6, 26, 28; Tebit 6 (sic). It is prohibited Nisan 11 6, I6, 28; Ayar 6, I6, 28; Tammuz 6; Kislev 6, I6, [28]; Tebit I6, 28. The enbu calendar so far as preserved has !igu Nisan 11 I6; Sivan 6, I6, 28; Arahsamna 6, I6, 26, [28]; Shebat 6. Prohibited Nisan 11 6; Elul 11 6-I6; Shebat 28.

Each month had some great ezen from which the month was often named in Sumerian, ezen-an-na, ezen-d·Mekigal, ezen-d·Negun, ezen-d·Bau, &c. The three great Shamash feasts were in the months ijuntu (Nisan), Ab, and Arahsamna, CT. 32 XI I5-I9 (Manistusu). These are fixed feasts.

See Thureau-Dangin, Rit. 86-8; Landsberger, Kal. 79; Pallis, The Babylonian Ak£tu. In the syllabary the akitu day is probably Nisan 10, day of the procession to the bit ak£tu, VAB.

'long day' in Shebat is excluded. The 20th is always a day sacred to Sin and Shamash with exception of Nisan I 20, so far as the texts are known. In CT. 2, 18 the ud-da-gid-da days are na!!J,u, 'omitted', and by comparing the accounts (see Langdon, Drehem, 13 n. 7) and assuming thatuddagidda is the 2oth it appears thatAb 20 was namru, Teshrit 20 and Tammuz 20 were not namru. Hence so far as our sources go the namru months are Nisan 11, Elul and Elul 11, Arahsamma, Shebat, (Adar], and Adar 11, Ab. Not namru are Nisan I, Tammuz, Tebit. Ayar, Sivan, and Kislev cannot be described, as no text for day 20 exists in the enbu series. 1 C£ KAR. 267, g; 184, Rev. 17; ZA. 16, 160, 25. 2 C£ egir-mu = arkat !atti, end of the year. 3 From context this should be 'calculated conjunction' of moon and sun, day before new moon is visible. 4 Difficult day, probably refers to days marked ana mar1i na~tu, a

Days g, 7, I6, ceremony on nights preceding daylight. day difficult for the sick, KAR. 178, I, 2, Nisan 1; 178, I, 50 (na-fcu-ut), Nisan 7; 176n 17, Nisan 14; 176 Rev. I6, Nisan 19; alsoNisan 21 and 28. In other words, in the tenth-century calendar all days uyulgallu and days when a physician may not tend the sick, i.e. I, 7, 14, 19, 21, 28, are marked ana marfi nafcut (nafcud, Arab. nafcada, cf. IV Raw. 38 n 20). The formulae for Nisan are extended to all the other months by inference in the old calendar. But what is rayu? Days 7, 14, 19, 21, 28 omit this rubric in the new calendar. 1 Here um nabatti is explained by day of the moon's darkness, which disagrees entirely with both old and new calendars. This note is found for days 3, 7, 16 only, in KAR. 178, I, 21 (Nisan 3) = 176, I, 13, for Marduk; I78, I, 48 (Nisan 7) for Ea; I78 II 24 = I 76 n 36 (Nisan I6) for [Marduk?]. Since the colophon ofNisan states that the general rubrics for Nisan apply to all other months, days 3, 7, 16 were already fixed as nubattu days in Babylonia before the tenth century. The reformed calendar of ASurbanipal has the same entries for these days, but abbs that service is by night on Nisan 11 3 (Marduk and Zarpanit) with offerings ina mt21i to Marduk and Ishtar, K. 2514, 7-8; ibid., day 7, Marduk and Zarpanit with same night-offerings; ibid., day 16, precisely the same. Sivan 3, 7, 16 on K. 4068; Elul 11, IV Raw. 32-3, all have identical instructions for days 3, 7, 16. Arahsamna, IV R. 33* has the same for days 3, 7, but for 16, nubattu ofMarduk and Zarpanit is followed by offering in the morning to Shamash, Belit-matati, Sin and MaQ.. Tebit, K. 2809 (day 3 lost); day 7 identical with Nisan (day 16 lost). Shebat, K. 7082, Adar 11, K. 4093, identical with Nisan. Since these are all Marduk ceremonies, Marduk is bel nu-bat-ti, lord of the night-ceremony, Mafclu II 157; VII 19. Since days 4, 8, 17 are e!fl!u days and among days when one prays for the soul of the king (t2m nubat-ti um e!!l!i occur together, King, Magic, 6I, I I),it has been suggested that this is a service of preparation for the festal days (of Nabu); so Landsberger, Kal., after Lotz and Steinmetzer. This theory is ruined by the fact that the days began in the evening. Harp. Lett. I 23 Obv. 19, ina nu-bat-ti seems to mean simply 'by night' = Rev. I, ina !i-a-ri ina nu-bat-ti mu-fu fa umi 15-kam, in the morning (and) at the nubattu of night on the 15th. umu 10-kam ina nu-bat-ti, on the lOth by night, ritual

The only day sacred to Adad is the 6th, but why should any special day be called 'storm or downpour of Adad'? Does this refer to the !igu Uassi, 'he shall chant a lament', usually ordered for the 6th day? 2 See AJSL. 28, 226, 50.

To this list the fadabu or procession-day must be added, on which none of the syllabaries has any comment, nor does the list of instructions for the months, KAR. I 77, mention it. This falls invariably on the 25th of all months of the enbu bel arbim series where a text for this day is available. In the old calendar of Nisan this day is broken away on both texts, KAR. I 76 and I 78. For Sivan 25, K. 8372 has fa-da-bu fa 4-En-lil 4'/ftar-Babili (ki) ~a-ri-it ilani, 'Day of the procession of Enlil and Ishtar of Babylon, banquet of the gods'. By night the king must set forth food-offering to Enlil before muzApin (Triangulum) and to Ishtar ofBabylon before mulMargidda (Ursa Major). For Elul 11, day 25, IV Raw. 33 m 22-5 has the same rubric,2 omitting 'banquet of the gods'; Arahsamna 25 in IV Raw. 33* m I5-I9 is the same as Elul 11, but adds that the king may not go out into the street. Shebat 25 on K. 7079 Rev. I I-4 in a broken text has !adabu of [Enlil] and [Belit-Babili]; offerings by night to Enlil before muzApin, to [Belit-Babili] before mul[Margidda]. Adar 11 day 25 on K. 4093 Rev. I 4-7 in a broken passage is the same as Shebat. It is probable that this procession of Enlil and Ishtar of Babylon, or Belit of Babylon occurred on the 25th of every month in both old and new calendars, since Margidda is the star of Ninlil,3 CT. 33, I, I5; OECT. VI 75, I4. In Bab. VI I57, mulApin is indicated by seven stars, hence it includes Pleiades, and is the star of Enlil, CT. 33, I, I, restored by V Raw. 46 A I, mulapin a-lik pa-ni kakkabani fu-ut 4-En-lil, 'the Plough Star which goes before the stars ofEnlil', in V Raw. 46 identified with dAsur = Enlil. Since this star governs the third decan of Nisan in the Astrolabe Pinches, Kugler, Sternk. I 230 and KAV. p. I23, I, it is
1 Or pseudo-ideogram, a-!i-lb? 2 Be-lit-Bdbili instead ofIshtar-Babili. 3 Replaced by Ishtar ofBabylon, or Queen ofBabylon in the calendars.



156 RELIGIOUS CHARACTER OF THE CALENDAR
obvious that its connexion with Nisan 25 in the Taurus period must have been the original reason for a ceremony to Enlil on this day. Before 700 B.c. this star in an ideal year rose in Nisan and opened the year. It is difficult to see why Nisan 25 should have been chosen as the day to honour Enlil and Ninlil (= later B~lit ofBabylon). From Nisan the ceremony then spread to the other months. The results reached by the priesthood of the last calendar issued by them are formal, stiff, Pharisaic. The life of man was now entirelycontrolled byphases ofthe moon. Nineteen of the days of each month had special names. Gloomy day meantdays of rest, washing-day meant days 6 and 16 when the king could clean his garments, 'dayofpouringout water' meant the 2gth, when during the moon's eclipse water was poured for the souls of the dead. All festivals of hoary antiquity based upon monthly myths are now fixed days and associated with stars. One could read here when it was permissible to marry, build a house, dig a well, recite a psalm, buy and sell, go on a journey, or sweep the house. Any conceivable act of man on any of the 354 days of the lunar year was governed by this complicated calendar. The king's life must have been as severe as that of a priest in the most ascetic of Christian orders. He seems to have been chosen to represent the piety of the whole nation. Indeed, ifany king actually fulfilled all the orders appointed for him in these Babylonian calendars he could have time for little else. The layman is hardly ever mentioned here; probably he was satisfied that the head of his Church, the great royal high priest, did all the piety necessary for the nation. The fact is, however, that the swarms of priests of many orders, who thronged the temples of Sumer, Babylonia, and Assyria, were really those who kept the letter of the law. On all matters of procedure they consulted these calendars. Observation of the law rather than the spirit ofjustice and mercy was inherited by the Pharisees, and their strict adherence to the rule of rest-days still regulates the manners of a great part of mankind to this day.



ADDENDUM
THE PRE-SARGONIC CALENDAR AT UR
Bv the courtesy of Mr. Woolley and the Trustees of the British Museum I have been permitted to see fifty-two tablets from Ur and the copies by Father Eric Burrows, who has kindly placed his own results at my disposal. This group of texts comes from the period of the pre-Sargonic tablets from Lagash and date circa 300o28oo B.c. The information is particularly valuable since these tablets provide the first opportunity to trace the important Ur calendar before the last dynasty of Ur in the twenty-fourth century. The following month-names occur in these texts.1 Names
marked * do not occur in the calendar of the third dynasty. (I) "'izi- UM-ka, No. 46. This text has a list ofsacrifices. Col. I 3, one bull for the udu(LU)- i;:;i-UM; col. 113-6, one bull and three lambs i;:;i-UM-ka in the kisal-mag, 'great court', for the goddess Innini. Col. IV 3-4 has ten ewes, the ma!-da-ri-a izi-UM-su, 'tax for the i;:;i-festival'.2 Since this tablet is dated "1-i;::.i-UM-ka, and UM is rendered by isinnu,3 the month should be read, despite the order ofsigns, iti-e;:;ln-i;:;i; udu-i;:;i-UM= udu e;:;en-i;:;i, where udu stands
for iti, itu; i;:;i-UM-ka = e;:;ln-i;:;i-ka; i;:;i-UM-.fu = e;:;ln-i;:;i-.fu, 'for the festival ofi;:;i'. No. 39 has a list ofsheep and lambs, ma!-da-ri-a i;:;iUM-i;:;i-gar-.fu (read e;:;en i;:;i-i;:;i-gar-.fu), i.e. 'tax for the festival ofthe torch', and is the same as the Nippurian month '"i;:;i-i;:;i-gar, or Abu, fifth month, and the e;:;en a-hi, 'festival of firewood', in Babylonia.4 The Sumerians at Ur had, therefore, this same midsummer festival, and in the time of the last dynasty they changed the name to 'month of the festival of the god Ninazu', for mythological reasons. 5 (2) 111d-ki-ta-ka, No. 44· This is the month of the akitu or New Year festival at Ur, Teshrit, a name also current for this month in the later Ur calendar.6
*(3) '11e;:;en-mag-4·Nin-e-gal-ka, No. 47· 'Month of the great festival of Ninegal.' This is probably the source of the early Assy
rian name of the sixth month ara!J 4-Belti-elkalli.7 (4) 111e;:;en-rnagJNannara-ka, Nos. 41, 45· No. 45 also mentions

This is probably the origin of the month e;:.en-mag in the later Ur calendar.1 In this month fell the nabnl, at Ur, and No. 17 has an account of sheep for the e;:.en-sag-u. Now sag-u means banl, 'to behold? and consequently this is the 'festival of the nabnl', thus proved to be pre-Sargonic at Ur. (5) it'fu-Ef3_d.Nannara-ka, No. 13. This is the original of the eighth or ninth month !u-E!-!a in the later Ur calendar.4 'The !uE! ofNannar' is a complete mystery, the meaning of fu-El is unknown and cannot possibly have any connexion with a 'third' month reckoning from akitu.

*(10) In No. 38 there is a festival, e;:.en-mag-4·Nin-EZEN x LA,
'great festival of the goddess X'. This deity is identical with Ningal, the Moon-goddess. Combining this list with twelve names in the calendar of the third dynasty,8 it will be seen that there were five festivals ofeating various animals at Ur, all of which gave their names to months. Since Ur was the principal centre of the cult of the Moon-god, Nannar, and the Moon-goddess, Ningal, it is natural that three of the pre-Sargonic month-names refer to feasts in honour of these deities.
