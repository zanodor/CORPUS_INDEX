INTRODUCTION
The Egyptian gods Osiris and his son Horus are more recognized by laymen and publicized in scholarly
circles than the deities of Mesoamerica, the location roughly encompassing pre-Columbian Mexico and
Central America. Needless to say, Egyptology is a seasoned science, whereas Mesoamerican archaeological
studies have just recently come out of their infancy and quickly grown into early adolescence with the
advancement in interpreting their artistic iconography and epigraphy, the latter being the translation of
hieroglyphs1 or other types of inscriptions.
Comparing the grain gods of Egypt to Mesoamerica is reasonable in light of their ancient dates. Joshua
J. Mark writes of the enduring length of years pertaining to the worship of Osiris which spanned thousands
of years from the Early Dynastic Period to the Ptolemaic Dynasty, which was the last dynasty to rule Egypt.
This time period encompasses c. 2920 – 1649 B.C. to 304 B.C. – A.D. 30.2 The Mesoamerican grain God,
generically the Maize God, has been recognized in the Olmec culture from approximately 900 to 400 B.C.,
and thereafter by other cultures until the time of the Spanish Conquest in the sixteenth century.
Although there are many narratives regarding certain highlights in the life of the grain god Osiris of
Egypt, no complete text has been found. The most useful version is the work of the Greek biographer
Plutarch from the second century A.D., which he compiled from older sources.3 Today we have a text written
shortly after the Spanish Conquest told by the native Quiché Maya from ages’ old recollections of the
creation and their beginnings, who then told these stories to Catholic clergy. Originally it was written in the
Quiché Maya language using a modified Latin script, and is called the Popol Vuh. This record, along with
painted ceramics, murals, and carved stone stelae depicting various pictorial narratives from the Popol Vuh

spanning to hundreds of years earlier, give us the story of one of Mesoamerican’s most important deity, Hun
Hunahpu,4 their Maize God, and his twin sons Hunahpu and Xbalanque. In Egypt, it was Osiris, their grain
god, and his son Horus, who have many corresponding roles with the grain god and his sons of Mesoamerica.
Albeit, Osiris is said to be associated with grain, Egyptologists often use the word ‘corn’ instead of
‘grain’. In Mesoamerica the primary crop was maize, and truly the peoples’ main food source for their
subsistence. By reason of any grain’s nature, the seed is planted, watered, grown to fruition, is cut down,
dies, and subsequently the cycle starts all over again with rebirth. The symbolism of this tradition is eye
opening when looking at the similarities between Egypt and Mesoamerica regarding their individual
grain/maize gods, not just from today’s mindset, but from a native’s ancient view of putting traditions into
a clear and understandable reason for all things.
Our comparison of these two grain gods, existing ocean’s apart, begins with their respective murders by
the Lord or Lords of Death ─ Osiris by decapitation and total dismemberment and Hun Hunahpu by
decapitation. The various events which they encountered are numerous for both deities and eventually
culminate with a rebirth or resurrection, completing the cycle of life.
4 Hun Hunahpu is the name of the Maize God in the Popol Vuh; however, depending on the locale, this god has several different names for the same supernatural being.

CHAPTER I
OFF WITH THEIR HEADS
Osiris of Egypt and Hun Hunahpu of Mesoamerica were dying and resurrecting gods, with grain
being their most salient feature. Grain, of course, has a life cycle — it comes to life from a state of dormancy,
dies, and comes to life again. It was an Egyptian custom to make a figure of Osiris from a linen bag filled
with grain.5 These false mummies planted with seed and buried with the dead were expected to sprout,
declaring that Osiris was risen from the dead (Fig. I.1).. For the deceased, whose tomb contained one of
these seed mummies, Barbara Watterson writes: “‘corn-Osiris’ figures symbolized the rebirth and
regeneration that Osiris, as God of Resurrection promised.”6 The deceased represented Osiris at death, with
the hope of renewal as was the case with Osiris. Germination of
seed was considered a sign of rebirth in both Egypt and
Mesoamerica. It was a basic tenet in their beliefs that through
death comes life. For these ancient cultures death was but a rite
of passage to rebirth and continuance in the universe.
Many colored illustrations show Osiris with a green face and
hands — another indication of his vegetative quality. Scholars of
Egyptology connected to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston,
note that the “Ancient Egyptians associated the green fresh
qualities of plants with youthfulness and new life,” and that wearing a special green amulet “was supposed
to ensure that the deceased remained forever young and flourishing, and suffered no injury.”7

In Mesoamerica the Maize God was frequently carved in green jade,
even from earlier Olmec times.8 The green color of this stone denotes the
color of a maize stalk, leaves, and husk. The Maya Maize God has
portraits with foliation, while a ruler’s headdress often had long green tail
feathers of the Quetzal, a bird representing maize (Fig. I.2). Maya rulers
often wore accoutrements of the Maize God to embellish their life-giving
qualities and state of deification.
These respective grain gods were killed by their arch enemy,
simulating the end of a vegetative cycle. Seth, the enemy of Osiris,
brutally beheaded and decapitated the Egyptians’ beloved god (Fig. 1.3). Their priests recited formulae to
ensure that the deceased would not be deprived of their head in the afterlife. This recitation was in direct
reference to the decapitation of Osiris by Seth.9 As George Hart notes: “For the Underworld of the private

Egyptian, Seth was a terror to be avoided.”10 When Seth murdered Osiris, Seth became a god of death.11
The dismembered body parts of Osiris were placed in a tree, while according to the Popol Vuh the head
of Hun Hunahpu, the Mesoamerican maize deity, was hung in a tree. David Silverman writes that “Osiris
could be slain but not killed. . . . his resurrection is constantly referred to.”12 The same may be said of Hun
Hunahpu as there are examples in Maya art of his decapitated but living head (Fig. I.4a and b), which
represents cut and harvested corn having the innate capability of living again.13 Similarly, even though the
grain gods of Egypt and Mesoamerica were symbols of rebirth and regeneration, there was also an aspect of
death while workers harvested their fields of grain, “for, with every stroke of his sickle, the Egyptian farmer
believed that he was not only reaping the grain but that he was killing it,” writes Watterson.14

Miraculously in their respective supernatural worlds the deceased bodies of Osiris and Hun Hunahpu
were capable of producing children — the Egyptian god through his sperm from his severed penis (Fig.

I.5),15 and the Maya god through his spittle.16 It may be significant that in Egypt some gods were conceived
through spittle; e.g., Atum’s spittle gave birth to Shu and Tefnut.17
Fig. I.5 The falcon-headed Horus emerges from the loins of Osiris’s corpse. Burial chamber of Ramesses VI (redrawn after Hornung 1990:116).
Horus, the son of the grain god Osiris, participates in a series of tests involving Seth, his father’s
murderer. In the end Horus is victorious.18 In the Popol Vuh, Hunahpu and Xbalanque (a.k.a. the Hero Twins
as they are frequently called by archaeologists), also defeat the Lords of Death and Chaos who were
responsible for killing their father the maize deity, Hun Hunahpu.
The Hero Twins were able to achieve this goal by obtaining the names of the Lords of Death. According
to Dennis Tedlock, one of the translators of the Popol Vuh, this knowledge gave the Twins the upper hand.19
To better understand the advantage one had as a result of learning the name of a god, a plausible explanation
may be found in Egyptian texts. The names of Egyptian gods were held secret and only through trickery
were they occasionally discovered.20 A. J. Spencer deduces: “The Egyptians believed that to know

someone’s name was to have power over them.”21 Eric Hornung explains: “The name of a god . . . exuded
power that could be enlisted in the service of magic.”22 It was by magic that the Popol Vuh Hero Twins were
able to defeat the lords of death in the Underworld after they became apprised of their names.
Deceased Egyptian pharaohs and Maya kings were expected to go through a series of trials in the
Underworld with the hope of overcoming death as was accomplished by Horus and the Hero Twins. The
atmosphere in the Underworld of these two lands was remarkably similar. For example, both the Egyptian
and Mesoamerican Underworlds were dark, contained mountains, a river, and both were divided by gates
that led to various compartments. It was here that the deceased faced trials such as avoiding the blades of
attacking knives and the threat of monstrous beasts whose aim was to destroy.23 In addition the Underworld
was the abode of the deceased somehow under the world but at the same time viewed as the night sky where
ancestral spirits existed as stars in both cultures.24
The Egyptians’ Underworld or Netherworld was called the Duat, and its locale, as already stated, was
in the realms below as well as the celestial regions.25 Hornung informs of where this is, and it is the same
for Mesoamerican cultures. He said, “The Egyptian believed that the Beyond not only was in the abyss of
the Netherworld but also was a part of the heavens. . . . It was here that the mysterious regeneration of the
stars and the dead, took place.”26
As Siegfried Morenz explains the divinity of an Egyptian king was a state of becoming “the bearer of a
divine office. . . . upon his death. . . . he has entered upon a new life: ‘You have not departed dead, you have

(New York: Crossroad, 1983), 44; Dennis Tedlock, Popol Vuh (1985), 147. 24 The deceased followers of Osiris ascended to the heavens as stars, and stars represented the souls of the dead.

departed alive’.”27 By the same token, this applies to not just a king, but as Assmann reminds us that “Osiris
was the prototype of every deceased individual. Everyone would become Osiris in death and be endowed
with life.”28
Erich Zehren summarizes the thought process of the Egyptian regarding death of a ruler: “The earthly
king, on his demise, was also born to the grave in the same way as the divine being [Osiris]. The mummy of
such a royal personage, who was regarded, on his death, as resembling or having actually become Osiris.”29
Therefore, the deceased Pharaoh became an Osiris, and like this grain divinity who died and was resurrected,
the Egyptian king when living was confident that he would also have a rebirth in his future life. Ultimately,
together with the sun they ─ the king and Osiris ─ would be reborn in the east.
Assmann argues that the Egyptians conceived the movement of the sun not only as the “cosmic character
as the source of light, warmth, and time but also an eminently political meaning, as the establishment of right
and order.” Therefore, “the sun god was the prototype of the king, who imitated the sun god’s activity on
earth.”30
In Mesoamerica we find nearly identical traditions. The deceased Maya king was often equated with the
sun travelling through Xibalba, the Maya name of their Underworld, and expected to rise again at dawn.31
Moreover, the ruler in his funeral garb was sometimes dressed as the Maize God. K’inich (a solar title)
Janahb’ Pakal, the great ruler of Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico, became apotheosized as the young maize deity
in a transitional point between death and rebirth on his sarcophagus lid (Fig. I.6).32 Dressed as the Maize

CHAPTER II
Voyage to the Milky Way and Orion
On a clear night the Milky Way is a sight to see; for the ancient kingdoms of the world it meant more
than just a band of stars. In its horizontal position, from ancient man’s view, traveling this river/highway in
the sky for the deceased led to eternal life in the hereafter. Of paramount insight on this subject was the
comment by Raymond Faulkner: “An especially important path through the sky was the Milky Way, whose
name in Egyptian means something akin to ‘the beaten path,’ a delightful and evocative interpretation.”33
Jane Sellers also reminds us that this path is water34 and is the counterpart on earth of their great Nile.
The Milky Way in Mayan is sac bey, meaning “white road.” This cloudy path of stars is also considered
a “road of water.”35 Therefore, the concept of a river/path/road held true for the Egyptian and the
Mesoamerican.36 Riding in a canoe, boat, or barge, the soul of the deceased traveled down the Milky Way
through the Underworld with the sun, and like the sun, would rise again — the deceased would be reborn.
Osiris traveled through the waters of the Underworld in a celestial barge or skiff down the same
river in the sky — the Milky Way (Fig. II.1). Regarding Maya myth, we find the Maize God portrayed on a
carved bone from Tikal, Guatemala, being ferried down the Milky Way (Fig. II.2). Images of the Maize God
in his canoe go back to the much earlier Olmec Culture in Mexico, making this a timeless tradition in
Mesoamerica.37

This intriguing scenario has both the deceased Osiris and the Maya Maize God travelling to the same
destination in the sky. Was it Sirius, the brightest star viewed from earth, or Polaris the North Star? No, they
were both headed for Orion, the place of creation where stars are born in the Orion Nebula (Fig. II.3).
According to the National Geographic, “the Orion nebula’s ‘nursery,’ [is] among the most active star-birth
regions known.”38 To recapitulate, both the deceased Osiris and the Maya Maize God were ferried in a
celestial boat down the river in the sky to Orion, where they were subsequently resurrected.

14
The constellation of Orion was well known to the Egyptians and
is mentioned in the Pyramid Texts in connection with the resurrected
pharaoh.39 Lines three and four of an Egyptian Book of Breathings text
(Louvre Papyrus, No. 3284) contains a passage wherein a request was
made that Osiris join in the horizon along with his father Re [sun] to
make his Ba [soul] appear in glory in heaven in the disk of the moon, and
that his body might shine in Orion.40
The name of Osiris in the constellation of Orion is called Sahu. E. C. Krupp, an
astronomer, observes that Osiris in his role as Sahu is sometimes shown in a celestial
boat (Fig. II.4).41 Reaching his destination among the stars of this beautiful constellation,
Osiris-Sahu will shortly be resurrected (Fig. II.5). Sellers writes of the description of
Figure II.5, “The Mysteries of Osiris (from the temple of Osiris at Denderah) ‘The Great
One falls upon his side . . . You shall reach the sky as Orion . . . Remove yourself from
upon your left side, put yourself upon your right side
. . . for you belong to the stars who surround Re’.”
Italics are from the Pyramid Texts, and in this case,
instruct the deceased to turn himself to his right
side.42 We will follow up on this action in Chapter
VI.
E. A. Wallis Budge, referring to the deceased, explained: “finally the glorified body, to which has
been united the soul, and spirit, and power, and name of the deceased, had its abode in heaven. This new
39 See for example Utterance 442, ‘Lo, Osiris has come as Orion.’ Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume 1: The Old and Middle Kingdom (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973), 45. 40 For a complete translation of this text, see J. de Horrack, “Louvre Papyrus No. 3248,” Bibliotheque Egyptologique, XVII (1878), 110-37.

body of the deceased in heaven was called sahu.”43 A ‘glorified body’ refers to a resurrected body, and is
typically symbolic of Egyptian royalty’s progressive future outlook of Osiris, with whom they will be
associated in death. The representation of Osiris when he travels in the night sky as Osiris-Sahu to the
constellation of Orion, is joined with other deity/stars.
In the previous Figure II.2, the Maize God is on his way to Orion with his hand held by his brow in
what is now often referred to as the “woe is me” gesture coined by Mayanist Linda Schele. The Maize God
and his entourage are headed for his rebirth when he arrives at his destination in the stars of Orion.
Orion’s belt was represented in Maya art as a turtle (Fig. II.6).44 Looking back at
King Pakal on his sarcophagus lid in Figure I.6, he has a turtle pendant on his chest,
indicating his rebirth. Numerous portraits were made of the Maize God emerging
victorious over death from a split tortoise shell (Fig. II.7).
David Stuart proposes that this same split, which appears
in Maya sky glyphs, is the phonetic sih meaning “birth.”45
A jade pectoral from Tabasco, Mexico, depicts the underside of a turtle’s
carapace with a head at the center of the much earlier Olmec Maize God, giving
support to the age of this tradition in Mesoamerica.46

Hornung explains that in Egypt turtle divinities were one of the divine
reptiles having a connotation of “regeneration in the Beyond, the
representations of these singular divinities surrounding the dead pharaoh
would have assisted him at the resurrection”47 (Fig. II.8). This concept is very
apropos to our discussion.
To summarize, Osiris the Egyptian grain god and the Maya Maize God are
murdered by decapitation or dismemberment, traveled down a river in the night
sky of the Underworld in a celestial boat and were unequivocally associated
with the constellation of Orion ─ resulting in their resurrection.

CHAPTER III
A Fishy Tale
In the ancient world concepts shown in art often had more than one significant interpretation. This
is the case with an aspect of Osiris’s and the Maya Maize God’s travelling down the river in the sky ─ the
Milky Way. We will explore this interesting aspect of their natures which involves ‘fish’.
Osiris was sometimes viewed as a fish dying in the heavenly river (the Milky Way), with the place
of his death in the constellation of Orion west of the Milky Way.48 In ancient Egypt fish represented a corpse
in their hieroglyphs. Ferdinand Justi, et. al., remark: “The ‘Kha,’ or corpse, written with the hieroglyph of a
dead fish . . . . must be preserved and made into a mummy ─ an Osiris.”49
The deceased who were typified and became as Osiris in their journey through the Underworld, were
sometimes manifested in the form of a fish in mummy wrappings. Hope Werness informs us that “Fish
symbolism seems to be connected to rebirth in a
number of ways. [Egyptian] Tomb paintings
depict Anubis carrying out mummification on fish
in place of human corpses, thereby linking the
dead with Osiris . . . .”50 (Fig. III.1). Desroches
Noblecourt of the Louvre informed Buffie
Johnson that in this case the fish represents the
deceased who must find his way through the waters of the Underworld. The accompanying murals show the
fish going through different stages of its voyage, and we are reminded that the deceased becomes an Osiris.51

18
Johnson postulates that the deceased portrayed as a fish, should be considered as winding its way through
the embryonic waters of the Underworld before its rebirth at dawn.52
Returning to the Popol Vuh, while the Hero Twins were in the process of tricking the Lords of Death,
they allowed themselves to be killed. The Twins jumped into a fire pit after which their bones were ground
like maize and thrown into the waters of the Underworld. This part of the legend is significant when we
compare it to the Ugaritic-Canaanite god, Mot, whose body was not only burned but whose bones were
ground before being resurrected. As we will see, this was the same outcome of the Maya Twins.53
Continuing the story with the Hero Twins, after their ground bones were cast into the Underworld river,
they miraculously turned into fish and
were reborn a few days later. This
portion of the story is beautifully
illustrated on a Maya vase (Fig. III.2).
Above the figures in the water is a
canoe traveling down the Milky Way,
again, the waters of the Underworld
and simultaneously, the night sky.
Below the canoe is a young man who comes face to face with a fish, both of which appear to emerge from a
larger fish/serpent-like creature. Being disgorged from the mouth of fish monsters is a typical theme of
rebirth throughout the ancient world.54 Dorie Reents-Budet postulated that one of the Popol Vuh Hero Twins
has already been reborn, while the other appears as a fish just before his metamorphosis.55 The Hero Twins

were their father’s sons and due to their rebirth, their father, Hun Hunahpu the Maize God, was also reborn.
They all overcame death.
When a Maya ruler played ball he sometimes
reenacted what the Hero Twins accomplished before the
dawn of creation as is expressed in the Popol Vuh. The
brothers were known to be great advocates of the
ballgame. In at least two cases that have been
discovered, rulers are shown wearing a fish as part of
their respective ballgame apparel. On Panel 7 at
Yaxchilan, Chiapas, Mexico, a ruler by the name of
Bird-Jaguar wears the accouterments of a ballplayer with
the net skirt of the Maize God and a fish on his back (Fig.
III.3). Another ruler on Stela 1 from La Amelia,
Guatemala, dances over his captive symbolized as a jaguar, after defeating him in a ballgame. This victor
also carries a fish on his back with only the tail being exposed. The
fish attached to these ballplayers’ outfits may exemplify the concept
of a transition that took place after the Hero Twins won their ballgame
over the Lords of Death in Xibalba, killed themselves, turned into fish,
and were afterwards reborn as a result of their magical, supernatural
qualities.
Another place one finds an association of fish with rebirth is El
Tajin in Veracruz, Mexico (Fig. III.4). A man wearing a fish-mask
headdress sits in a sweat bath, representing a place of purification. In Mesoamerica the waters of the sweat

bath were associated with the embryonic fluid of the womb, comparable to the waters of creation.56 This
scene in Mexico represents a fish/man deity in a transitional condition as he is about to emerge from a state
of death into a renewed existence. Mircea Eliade’s words ring true for the Maya in this case. He writes:
“Immersion in the waters signifies, not a definitive extinction, but a temporary reentry into the indistinct,
followed by a new creation, a new life.”57
There are obvious differences between the elements of these stories from Egypt and Mesoamerica, yet
all mythology undergoes some evolution; old elements are dropped while new aspects are added over time.
The Egyptian “Tale of Two Brothers” is a prime example of this tradition. In fact, not only does this story
correspond in many ways to Osiris and Horus, it parallels a familiar theme in the Popol Vuh regarding the
Hero Twins.
In this Egyptian tale the younger brother Bata corresponds to Osiris. He too dies and is reborn.58 The
severed phallus of Bata, like Osiris, is thrown into a river and swallowed by a fish. There is also a tree
element in the “Tale of Two Brothers.” Bata’s heart is hung in a pine tree. As we recall, Hun Hunahpu’s
head is hung in a tree and Osiris’s body parts are encased in a tree. Bata then becomes a bull, and when he
is sacrificially killed, drops of his blood turn into trees. These trees, containing the essence of the dead Bata,
are cut down and some of the splinters fly into the mouth of a noble woman who happens to be Bata’s wife,
who became pregnant. Her delivered son is of royal lineage and eventually becomes king, thus completing
the cycle of life, death, and rebirth for Bata. Here again we find a similarity, i.e., conception without
intercourse. As previously mentioned, a woman in the Popol Vuh conceives sons from the spittle of the
deceased Hun Hunahpu. Isis becomes pregnant from the sperm of the dead Osiris. These stories are of

mythological supernaturals who eternally engender themselves, and both Osiris and Hun Hunahpu go
through several transformations to reach their objective.
There is also an Egyptian document called the Westcar Papyrus that relates the King’s request to cut a
man into pieces so the magician can demonstrate his powers of restoration.59 The whole story about Bata is
his use of magical skills changing from one form to another, eventually resulting in rebirth. In the Popol Vuh
we see a similar dismemberment scenario. The Twins take turns cutting each other up into pieces, and
through their magic restore each other to life. But when the Lords of Death ask that they perform the same
magic on them, the Twins do not bring these evil doers to life after killing them. That is how the Hero Twins
defeated the Lords of Death in the Underworld.60

CHAPTER IV
The World Tree Connection
Recalling that both Osiris and Hun Hunahpu have an association with a Tree: Osiris dismembered
parts put in a wood coffin or tree and Hun Hunahpu’s head hung in a tree. We can break this scenario down
further with these respective grain deities’ connection with a tree or trees. In Chapter II the Milky Way was
discussed as a river or road, however, that is when the Milky Way is seen from earth in its horizontal position.
When in it rotates to its nearly vertical position it represents the World Tree ─ the term for this celestial tree
in the sky in this chapter.
The Milky Way is symbolically considered in Egypt as the sacred tree.61 Zehren, when discussing
Egyptian religion, reiterates our position on this interpretation when he states, “[the] heavenly Nile, in other
words the Milky Way, which was also a tree.” In fact, the theme of the Milky Way representing the World
Tree is found all over the ancient Near East and even India.62 In Mesoamerica, David Freidel, et. al., have
demonstrated the phenomenon that takes place in the sky when the Milky Way is in its vertical position and
understood as the World Tree.63
Viewing the Milky Way in its east-west configuration as discussed in Chapter II, it is very interesting
that the Egyptian culture sometimes visualized the Milky Way also as a crocodile.64 Richard Darlow’s study
shows that “Pharaoh THUTMOSE III was religiously declared a messianic king, a savior who would restore
his people to glory. He was called ‘messeh’, a crocodile-king. The crocodile is a powerful animal, king of
the Nile creatures, and so it came to symbolize the worldly warrior-king who soul was the magical crocodile
of the Milky Way, the Nile in the sky.”65 John Coleman Darnell makes this idea very clear when he states:
61 Zehren, The Crescent and the Bull, 267. 62 Zehren, The Crescent and the Bull, 113, 153. 63 David Freidel, Linda Schele, and Joy Parker, Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman’s Path, (New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1993), Chapter Two.

23
“The use of the crocodile as a cryptogram in the context of cosmic toponym is an allusion to the
Milky Way as a crocodile.”66
Similar to the concept anciently ─ what is below symbolizes what is above ─ is prevalent in both Egypt
and Mesoamerica. Among the Maya, the turtle and crocodile have roles symbolizing the earth. However,
both of these reptiles have a counterpart in the sky. The main element associated with the crocodile is water
─ thus, the Milky Way is considered the river in the sky where a crocodile resides in the heavenly river.
Over the years the Maya crocodile, as viewed in the heavens, had various appellations such as “Celestial
Monster,” “Cosmic Serpent,” or “Starry Deer Crocodile”67 (Fig. IV.1). They are one and the same creature
and represent the Milky Way river in the
sky, but at the same time considered the
roof of the Underworld. David Stuart sums
up the celestial crocodile and its meaning:
“I believe that the Starry Deer Crocodile is
more than an animated sky symbol. The
iconography consistently associated with the creature strongly indicates that it represents the starry,
nocturnal aspect of the more broadly conceived Celestial Monster, and that it in essence symbolizes the
cloudy Milky Way.”68
66 Darnell, The Enigmatic Netherworld Books, 30.
67 The “Starry Deer Crocodile” is a composite animal consisting of the body of a crocodile, feet of deer hooves, and a deer ear on head. The deer in Mesoamerica represents the setting sun. In addition, the Starry Deer Crocodile often has an eye with a Maya star glyph, clearly giving it a stellar association. 68 David Stuart, The Inscriptions from Temple XIX at Palenque (San Francisco: The Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, 2005), 72.
Fig. IV.1 Starry Deer Crocodile, Cerros, Belize (redrawn after Freidel and Schele 1988: 84, Fig. 2.16).



24
This brings our attention to Figure IV.2 which is also a crocodile,
not only as a river in the sky, but equally visualized as a canoe.
Scholars call this artifact an “eccentric flint,” because it is not natural,
but carved with a special significance in mind. Flint, in and of itself,
was considered a sacred material by the Maya. Looking back at Figure
II.2 we see the same story of the Maize God travelling down the Milky
Way in a canoe. Looking closely at the eccentric flint in Figure IV.2,
there are several images of the Maize God within the canoe: one at the
stern of the canoe and one under the canoe, and a stylized crocodile
head leading the passengers down the Milk Way.
What is even more interesting is the subject on Stela 25 at
Izapa, Chiapas, Mexico, dating to approximately 300 – 100
B.C. It has a clear representation of a crocodile, face down as
the tree’s base and roots, with the tail forming leaves at the top
(Fig. IV.3).69 Accompanying this creature is Hunahpu, one of
the sons of Hun Hunahpu, the Maize God.70 This stela
represents the World Tree when the Milky Way is in it upright,
north/south position. The Dresden Codex dating to
approximately the thirteen or fourteenth century A.D. depicts
a crocodile World Tree in the same position as Stela 25 at Izapa,
more than 1,300 years later, showing the enduring nature of this
concept (Fig. IV.4).
69 See original drawing of Stela 25 in V. Garth Norman, Izapa Sculpture, Part 1: Album, Papers of the New World Archaeological Foundation, No. 30 (Provo, Utah: New World Archaeological Foundation, Brigham Young University, 1973). 70 For an interpretation of the Maya Maize God’s son, Hunahpu, on Stela 25 at Izapa, see Oswaldo Chinchilla Mazariegos, Art and Myth of the Ancient Maya (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017), 134.

25
Therefore, in Egypt we have an identical thought process of symbolic association of
the Milky Way as a crocodile in its east-west configuration, and as a tree in its
north/south position. However, we only have the idea or concept of the crocodile/Milky
Way in its vertical position as a tree represented in art in Mesoamerica.
Both Egyptian and Mesoamerican cultures used their visual artistic talents to
understand various interpretations of an idea. The two most important concepts of the
World Tree are imbedded in the deities Osiris and the Maize God of Mesoamerica.
Egyptologist Budge wrote of Osiris that “he was also the great Sky-tree, out of which the sun rose, and the
Moon, which waxed and waned, and promptly renewed itself.”71 In a beautiful illustration, the understanding
of Osiris’s deceased body is encased in a tree
after being killed by Seth (Fig. IV.5a). Here his
name is Osiris-Soker, the latter portion of his
name Soker meaning a god of death and funerals.
Therefore, in this sense, Osiris is “the Great Sky
tree.” When Osiris was laid in his tomb, a
sycamore tree (the erica in Plutarch’s version)
enveloped the body of the dead god as we see in
Figure IV.5a. James Breasted gives the
interpretation of this scene as: “This sacred tree
is the visible symbol of the imperishable life of Osiris.”72
In Figure IV.5b a benu bird sits atop a sacred tree bending over the tomb of Osiris like a protective
canopy. This bird has been identified as a heron, and was considered “a manifestation of the resurrected

26
Osiris.”73 The benu was known for his dying and resurrecting qualities.
Over the bird is written “Soul of Osiris.”74
The oldest symbolic emblem of
Osiris is the Djed column (Fig. IV.6).
Many researchers considered it to be the
backbone/stability of Osiris, but of equal
importance, the Djed is a sign of royalty75
and “comparable to the Tree of Life.”76
Faulkner viewed the Djed as “a cult object resembling a tree trunk with
lopped-off horizontal branches, sacred to Osiris.”77 The four cross-bars as
seen on Figure IV.7 of Osiris’s Djed may indicate the
four branches of a tree, which were turned to the four cardinal points.78 The Djed was
the most common amulet to be buried with the dead, its blue color representing
regeneration, or if made from carnelian associated with a new life.79
The Mesoamerican Maize God representing the World Tree appears very early
among the Olmec in Mexico (Fig. IV.8) This object called a ‘celt’ by archaeologists,
depicts the maize deity or a ruler impersonating the Maize God, with his lower limbs
portrayed as a crocodile head. Kent Reilly states, “The body of this ruler is incorporated into the upended
crocodilian world tree itself.”80 This is the earliest depiction of the World Tree with roots represented by a

crocodile. In essence, this World Tree represented the axis mundi,
whereas the four kernels of corn typified the four trees/pillars of the four
corners of the cosmos.
San Bartolo, Guatemala, contains Maya murals relating to their
creation story, much like the Popol Vuh only in a pictorial narrative. An
inscription shows a date around the third to first century B.C., with the
murals produced shortly afterwards over a period of time. Although these
paintings were done by the Maya, it depicts the Maize God with Olmec
style features (Fig IV.9a and b). The Olmec culture having lived
previously to the west in Mexico was admired by the Maya, and at San
Bartolo the Maya chose to use the typical profile of the
Olmec maize deity. One scene of these murals shows four
trees of the cardinal directions with a fifth tree attended by
the Maize God standing directly in front of it. This tree is
the Tree of Life/World Tree itself and is virtually the Maya
Maize God.81 By doing so, the Maize God establishes the
center of the universe. By the same token, hundreds of years
later, simultaneously at the time of Pakal’s resurrection as seen on his detailed sarcophagus lid in Palenque
(Fig. I.6), this ruler impersonating the Maize God also becomes the World Tree, which centers the cosmos
and brings balance to humanity.
The World Tree may be many varieties of trees or plants in Mesoamerica, but the most well-known
maize tree containing maize gods’ heads is in the Temple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico
(Fig IV.10). The findings of Karl Taube are also of interest when he notes that “the contortionist position [of

a supernatural being] alludes to a growing tree and is found both
with depictions of the maize god as a cacao plant and the well
known crocodilian ceiba axis mundi.”82 The Maize God referred to
here is portrayed on what is sometimes called the Berlin Vase
where it is housed, while the figure is in an up-ended position
similar to Izapa Stela 25 of the crocodile World Tree (Fig. IV.11).
Roots on the Maize God on the Berlin Vase are his fingers.83 Simon
Martin notes of this particular portraiture that “the Maize God’s
realization as a World Tree is the ultimate expression of his
resurrection”84

CHAPTER V
The Seeded Earth
Often overlooked is the net/bead garment of the deceased Osiris (see Fig. V.6). For the Maize God
of Mesoamerica, a net/beaded pattern is often seen on his kilt/skirt type apparel. This type of beading is often
donned by women of both Egyptian and Mesoamerican cultures (Fig. V.1). What are we to assume of this
ornate and unique clothing? Everything in ancient cultures has a meaning in their artistic expression.
Fig. V.1 Net and bead apparel worn by women: a. Egyptian dress worn by Isis (redrawn after Casson 1965: 184); b. Maya female, Altar 1, La Corona, Guatemala, Dallas Museum of Art (emphasis of darkened area by author, redrawn after Jones and Spetzler 1992: 114).
In the Middle East and other nearby locations of the Old World, mother goddesses are sometimes
portrayed with net-like clothing. In Greece, Hera was known as a wife of Zeus, although her origins are far
older than myths of Zeus. Anne Baring and Jules Cashford demonstrate that Hera was originally an earth



30
goddess. She is beautifully portrayed in a clay relief from Thebes, Egypt, around
680–670 B.C. Vegetation grows from her head or headdress, declaring her a
goddess of fertility (Fig. V.2). More important, she wears a net-like robe
comparable to that worn by Isis, which, according to Baring and Cashford, may
represent the seeded fields as well as the stars of the heavens.85 In the case of Hera
fashioned in a clay relief, a dot (which replaces the bead at the corner of the
netting), is marked at the center of each diamond net pattern.
In Mexico, a mold clay form of a goddess contains the
identical net-seed pattern on her attire, denoting the same
symbolic imagery (Fig. V.3). Sometimes both the turtle and crocodile with the net pattern
are considered the earth (Fig. V.4). The
crocodile in Figure V.4 from the Mexican
Borgia Codex, a screen-folded book,
clearly shows the motif of net and
bead/seed where new maize grows from the earth. Michel Quenon
and Genevieve Le Fort reason the net skirt of the Maize God as seen
in Figure V.5, and Pakal’s skirt on his sarcophagus lid in Figure I.6,
intimate being resurrected from the split turtle which also has a net pattern on its
carapace as seen on the Resurrection Plate of Figure II.7.86 Again, note the turtle pendant
on Pakal’s chest in Figure I.6.
Quenon and LeFort cite Taube’s thoughts on explaining why the Maize God
resurrects from a turtle. They write “the growth of maize from a turtle means that the

By Barbara and Justin Kerr (New York: Kerr Associates, 1997), 895.

31
latter must be representing the earth. He [Taube] explained that although the earth could be thought as a flat
surface and conceived as a great caiman, it could also be perceived as a rounded dome-like form, which was
conceptualized as a great turtle floating on the surface of the sea (Taube 1988b:198).”87
As already noted by Baring and Cashford, the net/bead combination may represent both seeds in
fields and stars of the sky. This is most interesting when examining the practice in Egypt of placing a sheet
of beadwork over the deceased, which Budge believed typified the blue sky of night.88
In Mesoamerica, stars are equated with seeds. More particularly, when
the Pleiades appear to fall in the sky, it is imagined that a handful of seeds are
planted.89 Osiris is the personification of vegetal life that came
from the earth. Perhaps this is the reason this deceased deity
sometimes wears a net and bead-like tunic as seen in Figure V.6.
Another example of Osiris-Soker can be seen in this polychrome
wood mummiform cloaked in a shroud with the design of a net
bead motif (Fig. V.7). Sue D’Auria, et. al., speak of a burial at
Giza, where the donning of a net is described as “an example of
this phenomenon and it follows logically that a bead-net placed
over such a lifelike mummy would simulate a garment of life.”90 It is proposed here that the bead represents
a seed which will subsequently be reborn.
There are numerous depictions of the net and bead costume in Mesoamerica, illustrating the notion
of fertility and abundance. Perhaps the most notable example is the beaded, lattice skirt worn by King Pakal
who is portrayed as the young Maize God on his Sarcophagus in Palenque (see Fig. I.6). And, as we saw in
87 Quenon and Le Fort, “Rebirth and Resurrection in Maize God Iconography,” 897. The Taube reference is: Karl Taube, “A Prehispanic Maya Katun Wheel,” in Journal of Anthropological Research, Vol. 44, Nr. 2: 184-203. The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, 1988.

32
Figures V.1a and b, this apparel was also worn by royal women, since their nature is of fecundity. However,
if a male Maya of royal lineage wore the net-bead skirt, he was impersonating the Maize God (Fig. V.8).91
This practice can also be seen at Yaxchilan in Figure III.3 of the ruler Bird-Jaguar in his ball playing apparel
of a net skirt. In fact, the only male deity wearing the net skirt in Mesoamerican art is the Maize God, and
that is because maize springs from the earth when planted with seeds,
goes through its life cycle and culminates with rebirth ─ that in itself is
what the net pattern represents.

CHAPTER VI
Resurrection ─ the Ultimate Goal
Religions of Egypt and Mesoamerica incorporated the principle of the resurrection in their respective
beliefs. Immortality was a primary goal for royalty and was manifest in their art, literature, and ceremonies.
Hornung found a phrase in one of the Egyptian pyramid texts that states their belief in the true meaning of
death: “You sleep that you may wake; you die that you may live.”92 This phrase would be equally suitable
among Mesoamerican royalty as they too looked forward to the future beyond this life.
Referring to the deceased royal scribe named Ani, Budge made an important universal point for the
Egyptian when he wrote: “It was the outcome of the belief that his soul would revivify his body, and was
the result of a firm assurance in his mind of the truth of the doctrine of immortality, which is the foundation
of the Egyptian religion, and which was a deeply rooted in them as the hills are in the earth.”93
Egyptologist Jan Assmann elucidates their strong feelings regarding this ideology:
The dead king follows his [Osiris’] example. He is called Osiris and takes his place on his throne in order to rule the dead and the spirits, while his son Horus takes his place on his former throne among the living. This is the meaning of resurrection in the Old Kingdom. It is the exclusive privilege of the pharaoh. Resurrection is a proper term for this idea because the dead king is constantly summoned to ‘rise,’ ‘Raise yourself’ (wtz tw) is the typical address to the deceased, and it means not only to get up but to ascend to heaven.94
The Egyptian word for “tomb” can mean “place of arising.” The “rising” is comparable to the deceased
being resurrected, and in Egyptian theology it is clearly associated with Osiris and Re, the morning sun, as
they emerge from the Netherworld together.95

Figure II.5, regarding the starry heavens where the deceased
is as Osiris, his posture is with his left shoulder touching his bier.
He was given the instruction at the Temple of Osiris in Dendura,
to turn to his right side. In Figure VI.1 we now see the deceased
with his right shoulder as he begins to rise up from his bier as
instructed; note the netted apparel which was discussed earlier and
its implications. The Pyramid Texts now speak of this ruler’s
resurrection: “A jubilant morning . . . he has arisen! . . . The Firmament and its stars hearken unto him . . .
The imperishable stars are under his authority, and the never-wearying ones are his place of abode.”96
Similar to the Osirian saga of his life, death and rebirth, Maya kings believed after death they too
would follow the road of their grain god, the Maize God, defeat their enemies, and be resurrected. We do
not have a record similar to the Quiché Maya of the Popol Vuh for those cultures to their west. However,
from the earliest culture of the Olmec to the last inhabitants before the Spanish Conquest, the Aztec, all
believed in the Maize God, his life, death, and immortality after rebirth. An Aztec statement from the Codex
Florentine compiled shortly after the Spanish arrived is profound
and reads: “When we die, we do not really die, because we are
alive, because we are resurrected, because we still live, because
we awaken. Remember that!” 97
Typical scenes of an Egyptian Pharaoh who becomes
Osiris, or even Osiris himself being resurrected, are ubiquitous in
Egyptian art (Fig. VI.2). The most well-known known
resurrection scene of the Maya is, of course, King Pakal dressed as the Maize God on his sarcophagus lid

(see Fig. I.6). Other examples are of the Maya Maize God himself. The most popular depiction of this
scenario is Figure II.7, where he is shown resurrecting from the earth turtle. Other times, only not as often,
the Maize God may be seen arising from the terraced earth (a possible ballcourt), or other object
representing the earth ─ in either case, he is resurrected (Fig. VI.3a & b).

There is something wonderful about the visage of a resurrected Egyptian or Maya grain god. Paul
Pierret describes how Osiris is depicted at his resurrection in chapter 89 of the Book of the Dead, where “a
picture in the temple of Karnak representing Osiris on his bier but reviving, for he is freed from the bands
of the mummy, and has the features of a young man.”98 In the Egyptian resurrection, the deceased was
always resurrected as a youth. Believing that the dead became as Osiris, the Papyrus of Ani, Chapter XLIII,
says “I have become young once more; I am Osiris, the Lord of eternity.”99 Not only will the deceased be
as in their youth, but they will be complete and whole. Keeping in mind the deceased Egyptian is as Osiris
who was decapitated and his body dismembered, the dead is assured of his resurrection in a statement from
98 Paul Pierret, “The Dogma of the Resurrection among the Ancient Egyptians,” in The Old Testament Student, Vol. 4, No. 6 (Feb., 1995), 273. 99 E. A. Wallis Budge, The Egyptian Book of the Dead (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1967, originally published in 1895), 317.

Pakal, the king of Palenque, is depicted as the young Maize God on his sarcophagus even though
he was almost 80 years old when he died (see Fig. I.6). The posture he lies in is what is known as a ‘birthing
position’ as seen in other works of Maya art depicting a child after deliverance. This carving of Pakal is
one of the most beautiful in all of Mesoamerica found to date, and is one of the more notable resurrections
scenes of a Maya king. Even in those scenes where the Maize God bursts forth from a crack in a turtle’s
carapace, he is not old but a youth as seen in Figure II.7.
Other examples in King Pakal’s tomb chamber of Maya
royalty and their resurrection are seen carved in relief emerging
from the ground, together with trees or plants with vegetation. The
relatives are from Pakal’s dynastic line and make a huge affirmation
of their beliefs. It is fitting that they are on the side of Pakal’s
sarcophagus in (Fig. VI.4). Ruz Lhuillier made a statement after
discovering this facade: “it is associated in the religious beliefs of
the Mayas with the resurrection and immortality of man.”101
There are many things associated with the resurrection that
correspond far across the sea with regard to artistic motifs of rebirth. Surprisingly, two of these symbols
are of the heron and lotus, and are seen in resurrection scenes of both the Egyptians and the Maya.

The Benu was a sacred heron in Egypt and had a special
significance in the beginning of the earth as it settled on the Primeval
Mound rising from the watery chaos at the time of the creation102 (Fig.
VI.5). Depicted in many Egyptian vignettes in the Book of the Dead, the
Benu was a sign of rebirth, following the path of both the sun and Osiris.103
It therefore had a two-fold role representing the ba (soul) of both the sun
god, Re, and Osiris. The word benu is related to the Egyptian verb wbn
translated as “to rise in brilliance” or “to shine.”104 This shows the bird’s
relation to the sun and to Osiris, and as Richard Wilkinson declared, “the
heron [Benu] was also considered a manifestation of the resurrected
Osiris.”105 Due to its meaning of rising in ‘brilliance’ and ‘to shine’ no doubt refers to the deceased’s
resurrection. In fact, George Hart speaks of the attestation in the Pyramid Texts where “we know that the
Benu was incorporated in funerary rituals and had here come to play a role in ensuring the resurrection of
the deceased in the underworld.”106 Note: The concept of the Benu and rebirth needs to be investigated
further. Information on the Benu is limited and cannot be compared to the Phoenix, which is an erroneous
assumption according to many Egyptologists.107

Among the Maya the heron had a similar role
and is quite often used in Maya art. For example,
Michael Grofe gives us one of the roles of this Maya
Benu-type bird: “These birds [heron and other fishing
water birds] often appear in conjunction with the rebirth
of the Maize God”108 (Fig. VI.6).
In conjunction with the heron, which is a water
bird, are water lilies. The water lily or lotus also
frequently appears in resurrection scenes of the Egyptian
and Maya cultures. Wilkinson notes: “Because the water
lily closes at night and sinks underwater--to rise and
open again at dawn--it was a natural symbol of the sun and of
creation. . . . As a symbol of rebirth the lotus was also closely
associated with the imagery of the funerary cult.”109 Thus, the lotus
or water lily became a powerful symbol of resurrection. In Figure
VI.7 Osiris sits in his boat upon a sledge, and at the bottom are two
inverted lotus flowers which reflect the dawning of creation and
renewed life. Osiris is resurrected and is presented by a god with the
ankh, the symbol of life (Fig. VI.8) ─ the ankh will be discussed
shortly.110

More Importantly, Spell 17 of the Book of the Dead
depicts a wonderful painting of both the Benu and lotus, a
double symbolic reinforcement of rebirth, followed by a
mummy lying on his bier (Fig. VI.9).111 This is the connection
we are looking for. Returning to Mesoamerica we see the
identical symbols of rebirth. Sometimes the Maize God,
whether resurrecting from a turtle or other object, he dances,
indicating a joyous occasion (see Figure VI.6).112
Fig. VI.9 The deceased scribe Ani, with the Benu and lotus indicating his forthcoming resurrection (redrawn after Faulkner, Book of the Dead, Spell 17, 1972: 46).
The Maya plate in Figure VI.6 is significant in that it not only has a heron but incorporates large
water lilies and vines. The long bars at the bottom of the plate denote water, that is, the waters of the
Underworld, but at the same time, the heavens above. When a human is born, water is involved. It is the
embryonic fluid that is equated with the waters of the Resurrection, even the primeval waters of creation.

Assmann quotes from an Egyptian poem in the Papyrus Chester Beatty IV, recto, 11, 8-9, concerning this
beautiful aspect of a new birth:
we live again anew,
after we enter the primeval water,
and it has rejuvenated us into one who is young for the first time.
The old man is shed, a new one is made.113
Frogs begin their life as a tadpole, and then seemingly
morph into a 4-legged quadruped. It is no wonder that the
Egyptians saw the frog as a symbol of fertility and
resurrection.114 The words “I am the resurrection,” have been
found written on Egyptian frog amulets on the underside of such
artifacts.115 Amulets were worn or buried with the dead in hope of their rebirth to reside in the next world,
and this practice was done throughout all periods of Egypt. Because the frog is symbolic of both birth and
resurrection, it is seen in Egyptian art, and in this case in Figure VI.10, a sexual conception scene. The
deceased and mummified Osiris is impregnating Isis, representing by a hawk above,
with the divine man child, Horus. The frog at the right is a strong message of divine
birth.
In Mesoamerica frogs (and toads) are also a symbol of birth and rebirth.
In fact, one of the earliest depictions may be seen on Stela 11 at Izapa, Chiapas,
Mexico, dating to about 300 B.C. (Fig. VI.11).116 In this case a deity emerges
from the mouth of an amphibian. One of the diagnostic feature of this resurrecting

figure is the outstretched arms, and can therefore readily be identified as the Maize God. He is being
resurrected, just as he is seen more often emerging from a turtle carapace. According to Taube this early
Maize God may have coming from his mouth area “oral foliation often found with the Olmec and later
Isthmian corn deities.”117 Around A.D. 300-600 at Balumkú, Campeche, Mexico, four royal persons are
being either born or resurrected from the mouth of frogs in a large painted stucco
frieze. In fact, the Maya up-ended frog glyph has a historical meaning of “the birth
glyph,” in other words, to be born, which was usually accompanied by the birth date
of a ruler (Fig. VI.12).118
The Ankh is the most widely used symbol of life in ancient
Egypt. There are several meanings for ankh including ‘mirror’, ‘life’, or
‘bouquet of flowers’, and as Wilkinson observes, “In this instance there
is an added linguistic connection between the objects: but the underlying
principle remains the same.”119 The Egyptian royal scribe has detailed
paintings in the Book of the Dead (Papyrus Ani), of his resurrection.
Breaking out of his stone sarcophagus shaped like a mound covered with
greenery and flowers, he holds in each hand an ankh, symbol of life (Fig.
VI.13).120
Joshua Mark explains the meaning of the ankh:
117 Taube, “The Olmec Maize God,” 62. 118 Robert J. Sharer and Loa P. Traxler, The Ancient Maya (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2006), 134. 119 Richard H. Wilkinson, Symbol and Magic in Egyptian Art (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1994), 10, 22. See also 159 – 161.

42
The symbol is an Egyptian hieroglyph for ‘life’ or ‘breath of life’ (`nh = ankh) and, as the Egyptians believed that one's earthly journey was only part of an eternal life, the ankh symbolizes both mortal existence and the afterlife. It is one of the most ancient symbols of Egypt. . . . Deities such as Anubis or Isis are often seen placing the ankh against the lips of the soul in the afterlife to revitalize it and open that soul to a life after death.”121
Therefore, there was a double meaning of the ankh: “Life on earth, and eternal life in
the afterworld”122 (Fig. VI.14).
Another important symbol in ancient Egypt was the tyet, also read as tiet, tet, tat,
thet, and is similar in design to the ankh, but with the “arms” bent down (see Fig. VI.15). It
also has a comparable meaning to its later model of the ankh, and may likewise be translated
as ‘life’, with the tyet sometimes being called the “blood of Isis.”123 Both the ankh and tyet
are strongly identified with Isis, and in our following discussion in particular, the knot and
oval loop of their respective designs may be of significance. As Manfred Lurker noted regarding the tyet:
“It is often thought to have represented a divine girdle knot, knots having strong magical properties.”124 The
divine girdle is worn by Isis. Even the lower end of the ankh is composed of two parts and are the ends of
the bow-tied knot,125 much like the tyet. The simplified and more common version of the ankh does not
show that feature of the two ends (see Fig. VI.14 at right).
So far the true ankh or tyet has not been found in Mesoamerica, but similar designs may be seen in
their art. It was used by men and women as a knotted belt, straps on sandals, or placed on other parts of the
body but all having a loop. This type of looped knot in Mesoamerica has not been determined as to having
a special meaning. However, the closest assumption is that it is tied to blood sacrifice. Figure VI.16 is a

partial drawing of the decapitated moon Goddess with her flesh
torn apart, representing the moon’s cycles. In a scene from
Durán’s Codex illustrates a bloodletting ritual with the priest
wearing the knotted belt loop, but also holding a vessel with three
of these knotted emblems (Fig. VI.17). These types of looped
knots were used by the much earlier Olmec culture, and
apparently also associated with blood sacrifice, once again
showing their enduring nature of a design for over 2,000 years.
Was this looped knot a symbol of blood? The same type looped knot was worn as an accessory by the
earlier Maya during their bloodletting ceremonies and is seen in their codices of the same, but most notably
in the San Bartolo murals in Guatemala (circa 200 B.C.), where men give blood sacrifice and sport the loop
bow knot just about the ankles and other places. Giving blood in Mesoamerican cultures meant life ─ a
continuation of life for the community.

CHAPTER VII
The Glorious Afterlife
When darkness fell, the Egyptian Sun God Re travelled through the Underworld ─ the Duat
(Netherworld/Underworld) of the night sky ─ and during the day was seen in the heavens in all his glory.
The Sun God Kinich Ahau of the Maya, was symbolized by the cycle of life represented by the grain god
of Mesoamerica. He was born at dawn in the east, died and descended to the Underworld ─ also the Night
sky ─ and had a triumphant rebirth in the heavens.126 The Egyptian and Mesoamerican concept of
resurrection and mortality cannot be separated from nature. In a way, the grain gods of Egypt and
Mesoamerica had a double function because they are also very relevant to the path of the sun. Osiris and
Re occur numerous times in royal mortuary literature and art sharing equal responsibilities, even though
Re, the creator of all things, is superior as the highest of gods. Sometimes, they seem to fuse their
identity, even their souls.127 In Mesoamerica the sun and grain god are both considered highly important
to their people’s livelihood and had great relevance to their future after death.
Re had his role expanded into the royal and divine king of Egypt. As Stephen Quirke put it, “In
human experience the place of the sun-god was filled on earth by the king, who was not a mortal human
being but a mortal god sharing in the same substance as the sun-god.”128 Then, or course, when the king
died he became an Osiris, but still tied to the higher Sun God, Re or Ra. Quirke mentioned that a chapter in
the Book of the Dead has “a complex cosmic text in which the deceased is identified with Ra who emerges
out of Osiris.”129 A bit convoluted, but nevertheless, most texts accompanied by images are of the

resurrection of Osiris as a god, or the deceased as Osiris, going through the scenario of accomplishing the
goal of immortality.
In Mesoamerica, Kinich Ahaw is the name of the Sun God among the Maya. Many rulers used
Kinich as part of their royal new name they acquired at the time of their accession to the throne. With regard
to king K’inich (a solar title) Kan B’alam I of Palenque, Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube correctly noted
that his “reign lasted for a little under 11 years and he is the first Palenque king known to have used the
k’inich name (‘Great Sun’, the principal appellative of the Sun God) that would be such a constant of later
monarchs.”130 One of their greatest rulers was of course K’inich Janaab’ Pakal 1 (his full name), whose
famous sarcophagus is illustrated in Figure I.6 where he is depicted as the young resurrected Maize God.
Taube also informs us that “The celebrated founder of the Copan dynasty, K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo, is
apotheosized as an avian sun god on the Early Classic building known as Rosalila.”131 It must be noted, that
even if a king had the appellation of K’inich (Sun) as part of his name, when wearing his royal headdress,
it almost always contained green quetzal feathers denoting the king’s association with the Maize God.
This brief summary of the Egyptian Sun God, Re, the Sun God of the Maya, K’inich Ahau,
alongside with their grain gods and the relation of these deities to their respective kings, leads us to the final
destination after their death and resurrection ─ the glorious afterlife.
Spell 125 in the Book of the Dead illustrates a scene showing the deceased person being judged
before Osiris, as this god was the ruler of the afterlife. Upon death their human heart was weighed on scales
of justice against a feather representing the concept of Maat (truth) (Fig. VII.1). The souls (hearts) which
balanced the scale were allowed to proceed, and if passing all the tests required, they eventually arrived in
130 Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube, Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens: Deciphering the Dynasties of the Ancient Maya (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2000), 158-159. 131 Karl Taube, “Flower Mountain: Concepts of Life, Beauty, and Paradise among the Classic Maya,” in RES Anthropology and Aesthetics 45 (Spring 2004), 79.



46
a blessed place for all eternity. The weighing of the
heart needs an explanation as to exactly what the heart
of an Egyptian entailed. In this culture, the heart, not
the mind, was the “seat of both emotions and
consciousness . . . the social and moral personality
that the deceased wished to carry with him . . . into
his postmortem existence,” explains Assmann.132
Those who failed the test because their heart was heavy with misdeeds, were devoured by the evil-monster
goddess Ammit and condemned with her to remain in the Underworld, the Duat.
In Egypt there existed three worlds: The world of the living, the world of the dead, and an Elysian
world (the Greek name for a paradise-type world) for which Egyptians had many names, and as Assmann
observes: “‘field of rushes,’ ‘field of offerings,’ ‘bark of millions,’ and ‘house of Osiris.’ Here ‘resurrection’
does not mean to return to life on earth, but to be redeemed from the world of the dead and to be admitted
into the Elysian world.”133 Many Egyptologists prefer the term “Elysium” rather than “Paradise,” even
though a paradisiacal setting is quite appropriate for this locality.134 Assmann goes on to say “the fact that
the world of the dead is a place where the dead are dead, whereas the Elysium is the place where those who
were granted resurrection from death lead a new, eternal life.”135 Assmann further elucidates the Elysian
world, “This is what resurrection means in the concept of ancient Egyptian funerary beliefs: ‘to exist in an
Elysium hereafter like a god, free striding like the lords of eternity.’”136 This was truly a place where the
souls of the dead, now resurrected, lived a utopian existence forever.
Descriptions of this heavenly realm are akin to a paradisiacal setting. Hornung explains this sacred
place where “‘Shining’ grain grows in these otherworldly fields: its brightness is compared with that of the
132 Assmann, Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt, 282. 133 Assmann, “Resurrection in Ancient Egypt,” 125. 134 Note: Elysian is an adjective, whereas Elysium is a place. 135 Assmann, “Resurrection in Ancient Egypt,” 126. 136 Assmann, “Resurrection in Ancient Egypt,” 133.

47
sun and it grows to a suitably extraordinary height, corresponding to the incredible dimensions of the Realm
of the Dead.”137 It is also a place where the resurrected can sit under the shade of the sycamore, a blessed
tree of abundance comparable to the World Tree or Tree of Life. For royalty all these blessings were
plentiful, thanks to servants. The name of these helpers is ushabti, and they were responsible for doing the
agricultural work required to sustain the elite resurrected.138 Waterways and boats also existed here, and
excellent vignettes can be seen in the Book of the Dead, Spell 110 of the Field of Rushes (Fig. VII.2a & b).
Non-royal people were obliged to do their own work for their sustenance if they were blessed to have an
immortal life like royalty. Life in this Elysian world was patterned after the world they came from while
living on the earth.

In the Old Kingdom it was not believed that everyone had an afterlife, but as time went on this
changed dramatically for the lower classes. If worthy they would also live with the blessed in the hereafter

forever. It was not just the king of Egypt who took on the identity of Osiris in death, but every man or
woman giving them the opportunity to rise in the morning with Osiris and the Sun to immortality.
In Egypt, Assmann explains the transition from early thought, to the later more humane concept
and fairness for all righteous humanity. He observed, “It was through this process─first the image of the
king as a god on earth those death was conceived as a return to his heavenly father, and then the extension
of these grandiose eschatological concepts to potentially all of humankind─that the afterlife came to be
divided into the realm of earth and the Elysium that were characteristic of ancient Egypt.”139
The Book of the Dead also tells of 21 portals of the House of Osiris, where he rules in the Field of
Reeds. Souls who qualified to go on their eternal journey, still had to pass many tests. Each of these portals
had a deity guarding their gate.140 There were also secret names that must be uttered by the deceased
correctly so they “will not be driven off or turned away at the portals of the Netherworld.”141 This ritual
was a part of the tests that the deceased needed to accomplish in order to proceed with their goal of eternal
life.
The Mesoamerican afterlife is not so meticulously described in art and text as it was in ancient
Egypt. However, in Mesoamerica, “Flower Mountain” has become the key word for the paradisiacal setting
where royalty, honored ancestors, and the deserving deceased go after they are resurrected. A soul was
symbolized by a flower, so it tied in very nicely with the concept of what is given to those who go to this
blessed place, where they are offered an abundance of food, delightful smells of flowers, and a carefree
afterlife. Actually, many tombs within pyramids symbolized Flower Mountain ─ the deceased lying within
were destined for this locale.
139 Assmann, Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt, 391.
140 Assmann explains that a gate in the Underworld/Netherworld is an area between sky and earth, or to our mindset, the horizon. See Assmann, “Resurrection in Ancient Egypt, 335
141 John H. Taylor, Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead: Journey through the afterlife (London: British Museum Press, 2010), 136.



49
Karl Taube, the most prolific writer regarding “Flower Mountain,” observed some tombs within
pyramids depict floral motifs which he posits “represent the celestial paradise of the deceased king, the
ancient Maya version of Flower World.” This is true of Tikal Burial 48 and especially so of Pakal’s burial
chamber and sarcophagus (see Fig. I.6). These tombs have what Taube describes as “floating or falling
flowers and jewels mark the heady atmosphere and place of honored spirits, the realm of Flower World.”142
Taube also explains: “The sweet and fragrant floral soul is associated with the Maya celestial
paradise.”143 The flowery soul was destined for Flower Mountain after death. Once again, as with many
other complex ideologies of the Maya, this concept originated with the Olmec hundreds or even thousands
of years earlier. An Olmec jade piece of a man with attached butterfly wings is “widely identified with the
celestial flowery paradise,” as noted by Taube.144 This is just one example of the Olmec’s knowledge of a
flowery paradise.
The floral fragrant paradise of Flower Mountain was
closely aligned to the concept of the breath soul, which was
visualized in their art as flowers or jade.145 An example of a
wind god glyph shows a blossom with emanating floral aromas
as scrolls, air scrolls from the mouth of the god, and a T over
the ear representing air or wind (ik)146 (Fig. VII.3). Daniel
Brinton described the life-giving quality of wind by the natives
of the American continent as follows: “In the identity of wind with breath, of breath with life, of life with

Diego de Landa, a Spanish Friar in the sixteenth century, wrote what the Maya of the Yucatan,
Mexico, believed about a paradisiacal garden in the afterlife:
The delights which they said they were to obtain, if they were good, were to go to a delightful place, where nothing would give them pain and where they would have an abundance of foods and drinks of great sweetness and a tree which they call yaxche, very cool and giving good shade, which is the ceiba, under the branches and the shadows they would rest and forever cease from labor.148
So where is Flower Mountain in the celestial realms? Some Maya believed that this heavenly
paradise not only follows the path of the sun, but actually is the sun.149 In fact, the Maya sun glyph, k’in,
typically contains a flower with four petals. Taube also noted that at the West Court of the Palenque Palace,
“solar medallions encircle the sun god flanked by a pair of ancestor figures and two inwardly facing birds,
denoting the paradisal place of the sun and the exalted dead.”150 He further states regarding the east wall of
Rio Azul Tomb 1 in Guatemala, it has both Flower Mountain motifs and the sun god and that it “indicates
the journey of the tomb occupant to Flower Mountain and solar paradise.”151
Many heads of the zoomorphic mountain in Maya art
have blossoms on them; even if it is just one flower, they are
identified as Flower Mountain. These heads oftentimes
attached to structures look mysterious and even grotesque to
the novice of Mesoamerican art. In previous years they were
thought to be representations of the Maya rain god Chahk,152
but now being identified as mountains with flower motifs on
the upper portion of the mask. Temple facades were also

designed as a Flower Mountain such as we see at El Tabasqueño, Campeche (Fig. VII.4).153 The flower
rests at the top of the sky band amongst lying down Maya glyphic “S” cloud scrolls. Sometimes Flower
Mountains are depicted in murals (Fig. VII.5), and other times painted on vessels (Fig. VII.6). The latter
example on a vessel, a butterfly warrior rests next to Flower Mountain, where warriors were guaranteed to
reside after death. Thanks to Karl Taube and other researchers who studied these iconographic features, it
has been well established these motifs represent Flower Mountain.
According to
Taube, Flower Mountain
is a place of resurrection
where the deceased are
delivered from the
Underworld. It is also “the dwelling place of ancestors and the
means by which they and celestial gods ascend into the sky.”154
In both the Elysian world and Flower Mountain, the deceased who were now resurrected had other
roles to play ─ they did not forget their descendants. Assmann summarized this belief among the ancient
Egyptians:
The Deceased passes into an afterlife from which he is able to care for those he has left behind, a place where he has status and position. A connection can be established with him; he has not disappeared from the world, he is merely “beyond,” on the other side of a boundary that, within the framework of a culturally regulated border traffic, can be crossed in either direction. One can “descend” to him and call upon him, and he himself, though he perhaps cannot return in person, can be effective for his family from the world beyond. In Egypt, people made much use of this possibility.155

The Ba or ‘soul’and body were unified in life, but at death the link was broken and needed to be
restored. Much like Christianity, the Ba may be similar to the spirit that resides in man, but leaves it in
death. The Egyptian Ba could move about in the celestial world of the afterlife.156 In other words, the
deceased had the ability to come and go as they pleased, to visit the living and return each night to the
Elysian world.157 The living descendants needed their deceased parents to speak up for them to the gods
and obtain their needed blessing on their activities on earth.158
Essentially, the same belief was held by Mesoamerican cultures to a great extent. The Highland
Maya, and many other Maya groups, deified their lineage ancestors, who were perceived as protecting them
and their descendants in this world.159 The people entreated their ancestors to watch over them and bless
then with health and prosperity. Even today there are designated shrine locations where the people can give
reverence to their ancestors who are thought to dwell in the mountains, perhaps even Flower Mountain. The
ancestors stay close to home, writes Patricia McAnany, so they can give of their influence that is “generally
beneficial and protective.”160 And lastly, David and George Stuart emphasize this concept among the Maya:
Like many other ancient Maya pyramids, the Temple of the Inscriptions was probably conceived as a man-made mountain, constructed to contain the house of a deceased but venerated ancestor. To this day, many traditional Maya peoples see mountains as the dwelling places of their ancestors, the “mothers-and-fathers,” who exert a profound spiritual influence over the lives of the descendants who hold them in high esteem.”161
Many other cultures lived in Mesoamerica, most of them in the environs of Mexico. For example,
the people of Oaxaca, Mexico, writes Federico Gonzalez, “venerate their forebears their ‘lineage’, which
they trace directly to the heavenly city, or other world, where these ancestors dwell ─ especially on the
156 See Assmann, Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt, 90, 95. 157 Assmann, Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt, 213. 158 See Assmann, Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt, 52. 159 Patricia A.

Christian All Souls Day. The celestial city is a different space, a country coexisting with our own, a
homeland of spiritual body, inhabited by the gods and the departed. This impalpable reality was already
known to the Egyptians: ‘Know you not, Asclepius, that Egypt is the image of Heaven, and is the projection
into this world of all of the ordering of celestial things?’ (Hermes Trismegistus, Corpus Hermeticum).”162
