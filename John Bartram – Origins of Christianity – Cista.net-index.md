Its very simple really, Chrestianity is a made-up fake religion that never existed and is
based on a reference in Suetonius to early Christians in the city of Rome. There is
every reason to believe that Suetonius simply got the name wrong.
Christianity on the other hand, historically, is a group of cults that became established
starting in the mid-first century by the followers of a crucified itinerant messianic
preacher in Galilee and Jerusalem. The earliest verifiable writings of Christianity
appeared in the first century by a Jewish-Greek preacher names Saul/Paul. Based off of
the eclectic and syncretic nature of religion in the Ancient World, Christianity starting
fracturing into different groups combining some of the features of other religions.
That being said, fairly early on, the cult that would come to be the dominant one, the
one that ultimately is the ancestor of all current branches of Christianity can be traced
through the writings of the Church Fathers and other early writings. This strain of
Christianity was influenced by Greek Philosophy, particularly neo-platonism and
stoicism, but was far less influenced by paganism.
Now, I say all of that with my Historian hat on... if I take it off, I can express my full
beliefs as a Christian, that people who try to pander these really weird origin stories
for Christianity tend to think themselves too clever to believe in God, and view the
historically accepted version of events as too close to the actual Christian account of
themselves for comfort.

You really think that Suetonius, a highly educated upper class second
century man, would write the Latin word Chrestus instead of the Greek
word Christos, when he must have been well aware of the people he was
describing?

Yes, even in the early 2nd century, Christianity was concentrated in the
Eastern half of the empire, and the Christians who were in Rome would
have mostly been limited to the lower classes. As a result, Suetonius
probably had little or no direct experience with them, nor did the
people he would have... (more)

This is simply not true. There are references to “Chrestians” throughout
roman history from a cup in Alexandria, Egypt to a baptism inscription in
Asia Minor. Suetonius did not get it wrong, in fact the earliest versions of
Bible manuscripts often confuse Chrestian with Christian, and later editors
corrected what they saw as a mistake. Here’s a good site with a list
(incomplete) of manuscripts and inscriptions that use Chrestos, which is
Roman for “goodness” or “Usefulness”

As religious faiths tend to change - develop - over time, and historical views (as
opposed to the mythological) of their origins are always difficult, if not impossible to
obtain, to delineate the differences between Chrestianity and Christianity is very
difficult. The answer has to begin with trying to describe the origins and development
of the earlier of the two, Chrestianity. My answers to this made elsewhere:
Let us establish right at the start:
On the other hand:
3. As a number of historical personages are described as early Christians (when there
is no Christianity), they are, in all likelihood, Chrestian.
I have described many of them here:
Early Chrestianity does not look like Christianity for a number of reasons, one of them
being that it had no Jesus Christ.
The early texts later expropriated by Christianity - the gospels and New Testament
even they (the originals) contained no “Jesus Christ”, but used abbreviations and “IS
Chrest”. Until these Chrestian gospels start to appear - probably in the third century
and also probably after the - we have very few texts I’d regard as
Chrestian. This is one of the very few:
The book makes no mention of “Jesus” or “Christ”, however, the oldest copy we have:
So, by the time it is first written, the idea was developing, which should not surprise,
because this was so with the works of , whose family is Chrestian.
Perhaps the obvious pre-Christian character of this book (which I date to the late-first
century) is why it was withdrawn from the New Testament.
Above: Hermes with wand, on a Greek vase.
Chrestianity is overtly magical and when “IS Chrest” appears, he too is a magician, in
the Greek style:
Above: Early depiction of the raising of Lazarus.
It is the Greekness which defines Chrestianity and even more specifically, colonial
Greek, from Ptolemaic Egypt:
The above bowl is probably for a type of fortune-telling.
We see Chrestianity begin as derivative of ;
with the theology of Philo; as an imperial, strategic policy to protect the status of their
client states. It is the Roman answer to the rise in power of Judaea, with its Messianic
Judaea. The Roman elite execute their plans through their freedman such as
, their agents such as , and their clients, such as
.
The gospel story is a parody of their messianic enemies. This does not change.
The obviously-pagan nature of Chrestianity is blurred in Christianity, with the Trinity as
an exception:
Both are essentially political in character; the former is to protect imperial power; the
latter to project it against the Arab Conquest and Central Europe.

My research shows that Chrestianity is a made up word and upon further
research linked only to you, a very clear and error-ridden archeologist if
such moniker is in fact authentic. Therefore your treatise is horrendously
flawed.
Your claims with regard to the archeology concerning Christianity is also
not just full of holes, it's sunk. It doesn't take much research to find
documentation of evidence and not just a smattering but a boatload.
Then you've got the martyrs themselves you cannot in any way explain.
These people were tortured and put to death and yet would not deny
Christ! Under torture you would betray everyone!
And then your theory of the opening of John being a take on a dead
Greek philosopher was really a stretch. Haven't you read the opening of
the Bible in Genesis? From there read the prophets, Jesus’ coming the way
he was coming, his death, the type of death, how long he'd be dead, his
resurrection, his Ascension and his second coming...all are in there. Sorry
for the spoiler. Even your unbelief would be in there.
By the way you mentioned that the Jews called their Kings Christ. Evidently
you are not well researched as only one King has ever been called the
Christ, that one is Jesus.
I'm sorry that you're Faith is too much grounded in faulty science. Read

The term 'Chrestianity' is yet to be generally accepted as an English word.
Perhaps someone who coined 'Chrestianity' might have derived it from the common
Greek name 'Chrestos' meaning 'good, kind.' However, there is an English word,
'Chrestomathic', which means 'Teaching what is useful.'
All of the above-defined words cannot be compared with Christianity that is not only
good, but holy (Hebrews 12:22-24); that teaches not only what is useful on earth, but
what has eternal values (2 Corinthians 5:17-20; Titus 2:11-14).

It’s so patently ridiculous as to not even merit a response. The suggestion that
Christianity is an 8th century forgery imposed on the world with a projected history
back into Roman times is preposterous and requires more faith than what is revealed

Acts of the Chresmologoi
The Role of Oracles and Chronicles in the
Creation of Divine Men
By David Pelfrey 1 October 2010
Some etymological concerns An Exorcism in Philippi An orphan Jesus as hostage Pater Familias A Brief Summary of the Second-Century Position A License to Thrill: Corrupt Oracles and the Religious Crisis of the Flavian and Nerva-Antonine Empire Bakis as Ancient Greek byproduct of Chresmologia: Conflation of Seer Legends and Oracle Texts into Divine Men The Chrestorical Nature of Christian Texts and Chronicles, or History as Chrestory
The historian and archaeologist at their most elemental level are in a very real sense both oracles and diviners of past events. These disciplines have developed techniques and methodologies, and adapted technologies in order to draw out facts and artifacts surrounding a poorly or incompletely understood series of events within a time period and culture, and reinterpret what has already been pronounced. It is believed that through a better understanding of the past, the present, and even in some cases, the future, may in some manner find illumination.
There is a fundamental relationship running from Herodotus through Jared Diamond (currently Professor of Geography and Physiology at UCLA) linking the genre we moderns designate 'history' with the genres of the chronicle, the divine biography, and the oral and written tradition of the oracle.
A hallmark of modern historical scholarship is to dissect or separate historical fact from the fabulous, the fantastic, the otherworldly, and the supernatural from ancient texts and distill a small amount of high-proof fact. At the other end of the spectrum are those researchers who import well-established tradition into the interpretation of artifacts and texts: it is possible to arrive at attractive and superficially plausible explanations for historical questions and mysteries from either ends of this spectrum. In history and archaeology; however, it is the middle road that is most difficult. How to weigh and consider all of the recovered evidence and apply the whole of our knowledge to an investigation.
My colleague and I have each stood face to face with the uncomfortable circumstance of finding a miscellaneous box of artifacts or manuscripts whose archaeological context is accurately recorded, but, because the evidence does not fit established historical outlines, are largely ignored in the final reports.
Recently our research has drawn our attention to large quantities of artifacts held in museum fonds throughout Europe, the Middle-East, North Africa, and the United States related to the practice of popular magic. Such artifacts, most often exemplified by amulets and charms are found in large quantities at sites important to the development of the cultures of Greco-India and the civilization that drew from this taproot of Panhellenism. Equally intriguing are the occurrences of such tangle remains of popular or folk magic at sites and places associated with the appearance of divine men, sages, and prophets.
Predating, coinciding, and inextricably intertwined with the rise of Christianity, for example, is vast cultural substrate of, for lack of a better term, low-magic. That form of practice wherein a human ritually takes steps to harness a supernatural force or protect him or herself from such a force. The



archaeological assemblages and textual remains associated with these magical practices are among the most difficult to interpret because they are among the most alien to our modern system of scientific thought. In a word, these artifacts and assemblages are irrational when analyzed outside their archaeological contexts and historical layers.
A special note needs to be mentioned here with respect to the role of historical narrative and the textual tradition of Western Europe since the reign of Constantine I: for reasons deeply rooted in the nature and origin of Christianity and its rise to an orthodox expression of monotheism, our historiography is hostile to the serious study of magic. Oftentimes, in spite of the best efforts of scholars, the evidence is viewed through a lens distorted by two thousand years of conditioning.
HHI returns constantly to the archaeological record, or more accurately, the lack of an archaeological record containing any peer-reviewed evidence supporting a Jesus-centered Christianity for the first century of our era. HHI does not take the position that Christianity, the figures of Jesus, and other divine men, were fabricated out of nothing; a movement of this scope does not appear out of thin air - it leaves tangible evidence. Equally it cannot be said that our research indicates that the Jesus figure of the second century CE Gospel papyri resembles the form of the first century Jesus figure of the canonical tradition. Comparison of artifacts forgotten in fonds against even the canonical Gospel texts suggests that indeed something in the first century was missed. What we begin to see in the second century Gospel papyri fragments is the development of Christianity through a stage of Neoplatonic theurgy or high-magic; we therefore induce for Christianity a complicated stage of development closely related to the spread and practice of low-magic across the Panhellenic world, a low magic that syncretized in the countryside and market places of Egypt and Greater Syria, a hydra-headed and bewildering expression of ritual folk-practices that unevenly mirrored the high-temple pantheons and religions of the Roman world (and beyond). Expressions of magic that were plied and peddled as a trade and business in complement and, increasingly, competition with, the sanctioned religions of the empire.
That these expressions of popular magic fell under the stern concern of the Roman emperors is first attested by the burning of prophetic writings (more than 2,000) by Augustus after he became Pontifex Maximus.[ref]Suet. Aug. 31.1[/ref] This act of Augustus is, given the cost of manuscripts and the close control of publishing in the empire, singularly interesting for several reasons, two of which are listed below:
● these texts are described as prophetic, that is they are oracles cast or oracles interpreted and recorded in textual form ● these texts were viewed as a threat to the stability of the imperial regime; likely this was due to the both the nature of the oracles themselves as well as the circumstance that such oracles represented a textual form promulgated to the general public by practitioners of magic or divination counter to the interests of the Roman regime. As we explore in the discussion below, there is a long tradition in the Hellenic world for magic and divination cast before the public from texts containing the words of divine figures. ● Augustus likely caused works related to a type of divination associated with the Greek lexeme Χρησμολογιa or chresmologia (see below).
We thus find ourselves before the fires of Augustus' first century bibliocaust contemplating the cultural phenomenon that is popularly termed 'magic' and its relation to the Christianity that suddenly makes an appearance in the archaeological record in the years surrounding the reign of the emperor Hadrian; against this uneven light, we confront again the question of the need to develop a systematic archaeology of magic thoroughly integrated with any links its archaeological and historical record may have with high religions of the same cultural and artifact horizon. As this discussion of magic unfolds, we will concentrate in particular on that form of magic or divination whose meaning is encompassed by the ancient Greek lexeme:
Χρησμολογιa (chresmologia): the delivery of an oracle, prophecy, divination, foretelling; interpretation or application of an oracle, as well as that practitioner of this form of divination - the



Χρησμολoγος (chresmologos).
Magic, as my colleague has tirelessly pointed out in a series of excellent posts on this site, is a very complex and serious subject for historians, archaeologists, and, it might as well be stated, theologians, to confront if they hope to unlock many of the sublime hows and whys of history. This is particularly true when the inquiry of our age arrives at the dark threshold of the history of the practice of elevating men to divine status. HHI has already demonstrated that there is a proper and rational approach to be taken with respect to the archaeology and history of magic. The discussion that follows is greatly indebted to my colleague's determined insights.
HHI has been studying the historical and archaeological record tracing the origin of Christian papyri and artifacts back to the second century CE. We asserted that pushing the origin of a Jesus-centered Christianity further into the first century is, given the state of the present evidence, not valid science.
We have outlined in very elemental and broad strokes that during Hadrian's reign, religious policies were adopted by the Imperial regime to address the volatile popular religious forces pulling the empire apart from the inside. These outlines concentrated on Judaism during the period ranging from the Kitos Revolt to the Bar Kosiba Rebellion, and the founding of the cult of Antinous. Particular attention was paid to the mechanics, logistics, and power-politics of publishing written works during this period. These outlines took us to the Antinoeon of Hadrian's villa and the proto-Christian practices of a highly syncretic cult, or cults at Aelia Capitolina.
Perhaps coming to a head with Trajan, the reign of Hadrian should really be viewed as one characterized by religious crises of the first magnitude; a crisis not to be eclipsed in scope and duration until the Crusades, and in the category of civil disruption, until the Reformation. Under Hadrian, as we have discussed, a Rome pursued a 'final solution' for the threat posed by messianic Judaism.
As important, Hadrian and his advisers launched efforts to curtail and control the practice and expression of popular magic - particularly the variety of popular magic arising out of Greco-Roman Egypt.[ref]Matthew Dickie, Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World (2003) PP. 195-241.[/ref] It is possible to argue that one of the main aims of the policy of establishing the Antinous cult was to draw the lucrative practice of popular magic under the oversight and supervision of the imperial regime.
Taking the discussion this far, we have a duty to attempt an outline of just how that sect we describe as proto-Christian, or proto-Rabbinical Judaism in our earlier posts, might have appeared at the close of the first and dawn of the second centuries CE. Based solely upon physical evidence with firm dates, what is the shape of this secretive cult? Our answer takes us deep into the origin of our own culture to the nexus of magic, oracles, chronicles, and the writing of divine biography. Indeed, we come face to face with the uncomfortable origin of historical writing as the casting and recasting of the past against oracular textual templates. More often than not, these oracular templates act on a human stage in ancient historical narratives in the guise of characters of divine men who articulate the voice of an ancient authority or textual tradition.[ref]Sarah Iles Johnson, Ancient Greek Divination (2008), pp.137-141. See also: David Edward Aune, Prophesy in Early Christianity and the Ancient Mediterranean World, (William B. Eerdmans Publishing Companty: Grand Rapids, MI, 1983) pp. 38-47)[/ref]
Throughout much of recorded history, the chresmologue and his or her divinations remained in the realm of low-magic. These magicians could be honest practitioners, or, as we see in Aristisophanes' Birds, the chresmologue could be something of a hustler and snake-oil salesman. It is one of our civilizations' great archaeological and historical challenges to explain how a practice rooted in the low-magic of the Panhellenic world, syncretized with Neoplatonism and the mystery religions of the Roman East around the figure of Jesus Christ, to become a world religion.



Some etymological concerns
My colleague has taken some pains to demonstrate the evidence of the iota scribal substitution in the Tacitus MSS tradition. This observation brings to the fore the general issue of how ancient vowel systems are transliterated into English. Having worked as a professional translator utilizing the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets, I have found that the problem of vowel transliteration has always presented inconveniences: the English system of vowels is simply too limited at times for the combination of vowel sounds found in several Indo-European inflected language systems.
Without delving too deeply into the origin and history of classical Greek vowel transliteration, it may be said that, in a nutshell, the early history of our Greek to Latin transliteration system rest heavily on a foundation of Christian lexicographers and translators, be they Catholic or Protestant, or either one of these former mixed with Renaissance humanism. When we arrive at the close of the Napoleonic Wars, at the dawn of our era’s quest for the secular or historical Jesus, dictionaries in common circulation treating the subject of Classical and New Testament Greek had settled into a fairly regular system of vowel transliteration; however, as the example from 1828, illustrates, we would do well not to take too much at face value: in an ancient MSS when is an eta simply pronounced as an eta? Conversely at what point does an eta require a diacritical mark like a tono?
The below examples are taken from page 605 of Rev. John Groves’ Greek-English Dictionary (Classical and New Testament Usages) imprinted 1828. The major element of notice is that each of these lexemes derives its root from a common verb form: χράω. On this page is calqued a family of words whose meanings convey concepts related to oracles, divination, prophecy, prophets, money lending, loans, etc. As can be seen in the first example, we also have not only the idea of usefulness, profit, and loans, but also the ideas of oracle, quotation, extract, passages taken from textual sources:
Χρη̃̃σις –ιος, Att. – εως, ή (fr. χράω to use) use, utility, profit; a loan, an oracle, response; a quotation, extract, passage from another writer a.χρησιν Χρησμολογίω - ω̄, (fr. Χρηςμὸς an oracle, and λέγω to speak) to speak oracles, prophesy, foretell; to interpret omens, explain oracles. Χρησμολογίa –ας ή (fr. same) delivery of an oracle, prophecy, divination, foretelling; interpretation or application of an oracle. Χρησμολόγος, -ου ό ή (fr. same) a deliverer of oracles, a diviner, prophet; an interpreter or expounder of oracles. Χρησήρ, -η̃ρος, ό (fr. χράω to deliver oracles) giving oracles, oracular. Χρηστήριος, - ον, ό (fr. χράω to deliver oracles) oracular, foreboding, prophetic. Χρήστης, -ου, ό (fr. χράω to lend) a creditor, lender of money, usurer; a debtor, borrower; a declarer of oracles, prophet.
By way of casual observation, it is curious that with the exception of the lexemes chresmologos and chresmologia, all of the other words on our list derive from the verb form χραω and rather nonchalantly is rendered as "to use, to deliver oracles" (several times), and "to lend." In each case the root of the verb is consistent; however the vowel shift in the noun form, or compound, evidences a vowel shift or consonant change in the root. While some of the vowel shifts can be explained as a result of stress shift in multisyllabic words, it is not at all clear why some lexemes in this family employ certain vowels and not others. This particular tendency with the Χρηςτ – root appears fixed in the lexicography of nineteenth-century Greek-English dictionaries and the question confronts the curious student of history regarding the presence of any bias in reading and rendering Χρηστ- as Χριστ-.
To frame the question more simply: at what point in history does it become possible for givers of oracles and money lenders to become anointed and Christians? Second, and just as important, when and why 'Jesus Christ' vice 'Jesus Chrest'?
A great deal of our early evidence for χρηστ- vice χριστ- comes from a difficult but important primary source, the Papyri Graecae Magicae (PGM). As it stands, we will be devoting more resources to this topic because the PGM represents a crucial, and perhaps the crucial, cultural layer ignored in historical



and archaeological equations seeking to explain the origin of the Jesus figure present in the canonical Gospels. The mechanism of this development is likely relevant to the creation of divine men across the cultural and historical sphere we are exploring.
The history of the collection, transcription, and publication of the PGM is an epic of its own and resulted from the determined efforts of the German scholar K. von Preisendanz, whose first edition of the multi-volume work went to press between 1928 and 1931. Von Presendanz, however, was not without bias when it came to the issue of Greek transliteration and graphemes. The English scholar M. J. Edwards, wrote a short article in 1991 discussing the issue of Von Presedanz substituting χριστος for χρηστος in Papyri Graecae Magicae XDI.28.[ref]K. von Preisendanz, Papyri Graecae Magicae Vol. II (Leipzig 1931) p. 102 as cited by M. J Edwards, Χρηστος in a Magical Papyrus, Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, Bd. 85 (1991), pp. 232-236.[/ref] Edwards wrote:
Preisendanz emends Χρηστος to Χριστος, reasoning that the πολυ δυναμενος must be the Christian Saviour. In this note I argue that, while his interpretation is correct, the manuscript reading should remain unchanged. I shall argue, that is to say, that the form is not a vulgar orthographic variant, but the key to the identity of the group for whom the petition was composed.
Leaving aside Edward's identification of Chrestos here as being the Christian Savior for the moment, his reasoning for adjusting the grapheme and transliteration of PGM XDI.28 is sound and points the way toward the proper handling of this primary source. One can not help but wonder at the number of MSS within the PGM that might require review and correction on this particular graphical issue since, as noted above, there is a clear hellenistic and Panhellenistic root for χρηστ- and this root possesses a family of lexemes denoting and connotating specific connections with divine prophets, prophecy, oracles, money lending, and the market place and practice of magic. Edwards goes on to remark:
Neither pagans nor Christians in late antiquity could distinguish χρηστος and χριστος by their sounds. From this phonetic fact it has been inferred that the orthography of Christ's name was also a matter of indifference, at least to pagans who knew of the sect by hearsay, just as the ι of Χριστος gives way to η and ει both within and outside the Church.
It should be noted that Edward's verdict that the circle of writers encompassed by Pliny, Tacitus, Suetonius, while not able to discern the difference in sound, did understand the difference in graphemes needed to express the words and concepts in writing with precision is but a supposition. The attempt by Edwards to dismiss or neutralize our oldest (and so far only) MS for Tacitus which employs the lexeme chrestiani at Annales XV.44 is perhaps, and with due respect, a bit hasty. The issue is not a simple one of orthography, but also brings to the fore the understanding each writer possessed of religion, theurgy, and the common practice of magic in their environs. We simply have no real assessment of this question and all evidence must perforce remain on the table.



An Exorcism in Philippi
[16] And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl, having a pythonical spirit, met us, who brought to her masters much gain by divining. [17] This same following Paul and us, cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the most high God, who preach unto you the way of salvation. [18] And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved, turned, and said to the spirit: I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out from her. And he went out the same hour. [19] But her masters, seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, apprehending Paul and Silas, brought them into the marketplace to the rulers. [20] And presenting them to the magistrates, they said: These men disturb our city, being Jews; [21] And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor observe, being Romans. [22] And the people ran together against them; and the magistrates rending off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods. [23] And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the gaoler to keep them diligently. [24] Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. [25] And at midnight, Paul and Silas praying, praised God. And they that were in prison, heard them. (Douay-Rheims Bible, Acts 16:16).[ref]For the purposes of this post, we are citing New Testament passages from the Douay-Rheims English version. We encourage all readers to access these texts in the original ancient language; however, we settled on Douay-Rheims because it retains language closure to the usage of the Panhellenistic world in which
Roman marble statue of Apollo, depicted with his attributes, the lyre and the sacred snake Python. The tree trunk around which the snake is wrapped is inscribed with the words "Apollonios made it". Circa 150 CE, restored c. 1790. From the Ny Carlsberg GlyptotekItem.



Christianity took shape. That is to say, those elements that the Protestant scholars and translators of the NT found offensive, actually shed interesting light on the question of the canonical New Testament's relationship with Neoplatonic theurgy and Panhellenic low-magic.[/ref]
This passage, to which my colleague called to my attention, is one of the most singular in the New Testament due to the identification of the spirit in the story being pythonic (pneuma pithonos). Commentaries of this passage are widely varied. Christian exegesis tends to focus the pythonic spirit depicted here: first, Paul confronts a spirit representative of Apollo’s prophetic powers and second, these commentators seek to link the python, being a serpent, with the Judeo-Christian semiotics of python as equivalent to the evil serpent of Genesis, or the devil.[note] Other scholars, of which John Dominic Crossan stands as an example, note the major economic element of tension within the passage: it is a dispute concerning the business of magic. Crossen, however, does not take the analysis far enough. His Christians are not practicing magic themselves. Crossan simply writes that what the Paul and Silas figures are doing is "bad for pagan business."[ref] John Dominic Crossan and Johnathan L. Reed, In Search of Paul (2004) p. 30[/ref] Such language side steps the issue: the Paul and Silas figures are depicted practicing their own form of magic tied to the words and deeds of a past prophet. In other words Acts 16:16 should not viewed as pagan vs. Christian, but as engastrimuthoi vs chresmologoi: two forms of street magic competing in the Panhellenic market place.
However, and as my colleague immediately noted, this passage in Acts is a dialogue on magic and a duel between traditional Panhellenic high-magic (to be understood here as Neoplatonic theurgy) represented by the publically-sanctioned practice of pythonic divination (usually under the auspices of a sanctioned temple such as those that existed at Delphi and Didyma) against a popular and illicit practice of low-magic by the chresmologue, dipicted by the figures Paul and Silas. Here it should be understood that this form of low-magic, contrary to what this passage in acts appears to indicate, and this is an important redactive criticism, is solidly within the Panhellenic tradition of magic.[ref]See discussion below on
Bakis. See also Erwin Rohde, Psyche: The Cult of Souls and the Belief in Immortality among the Greeks, trans. from the 8th edn. by W. B. Hillis (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1925; reprinted by Routledge, 2000, p. 294: digital historiography leaves one with the impression that exorcism in Christianity is a fundamentally Judaic in origin without reference to Panhellenic influences[/ref]
From the Neoplatonist point of view, the difference between high-magic (the theurgy of the temple oracles for example) and low-magic practiced by the Chrestians was defined by, ironically, the issue of free will. Popular magicians exercised their arts through harnessing or invoking a daimon or spirit and compelling the daimon to perform an act or influence a person whether the daimon or targeted person willingly cooperated. It should be clearly understood that, in the Roman empire of the second century, there were clear moral guidelines to the practice of magic as well as the proper experience of magic in association with the religious experience. First century Chrestianity ran afoul of both Roman law (lex superstitio illicita) and Neoplatonist morality on a variety of grounds.
It should be remarked that Apollo’s representative in the form of a slave girl inhabited by a pythonic spirit at significant geographic remove from the Pythia at Delphi. As a slave, the girl practicing forced divination at Philippi does not meet the criteria set forth by Plutarch for a proper pythonic prophetess. So what is the connection in Acts 16:16 with Delphi, or with Apollo?
Sarah Iles Johnson, writing in Ancient Greek Divination [ref]Sarah Iles Johnston, Ancient Greek Divination. Blackwell Ancient Religions. Malden, MA/Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Pp. xiii, 193.[/ref], treats the subject of the pythonic slave girl in Acts 16:16 directly, explaining that the slave girl is a kind of freelance diviner known in ancient Greece as an engastrimuthoi, or belly-talker. By the Roman Imperial period, the popular term for such freelance diviners had become pythones. This girl’s owners clearly sought to enhance the reputation and allure of their engastrimuthoi by providing a Delphi divination experience closer to Philippi for those individuals who could not make the trip to the temple oracle.
In this passage, the action by the Paul figure ran afoul of Hellenic laws and customs, particularly with respect to the magical act of exorcism. According to Roman law, magic or Magia constituted a criminal



offense when performed with evil intent to either physically harm or defraud a person. Magia was a broad term encompassing many possible types of magic practices: sorcery, nocturnal sacrifices, numerology, astrology, spell-casting, etc. The evolution of Roman laws restricting the unlawful practice of magic has a long history.[ref]James B. Rives, Magic in Roman Law: The Reconstruction of a Crime, Classical Antiquity October 2003, Vol. 22, No. 2, Pages 313–339; and C. Pharr, Interdiction of Magic in Roman Law 269 XVIII, 1932.[/ref] However, the laws and attitudes pertaining to the Acts 16:16 episode directly trace themselves to Sulla’s Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis (82 BCE)[ref]Article Leges Corneliae by George Long, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, on pp686?687 of William Smith, D.C.L., LL.D.: A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875.[/ref]. The owners of the pythoness would likely have hoped to recover damages from Paul on the grounds that the exorcism of the diviner constituted harm. Moreover, the loss of the pythoness’s powers certainly resulted in financial harm to her owners. It is an open question as to the extent that the loss of one of the Philippi diviners became a gain by the Paul character.
The Lex Cornelia is significant because it specifically treats the subject of poison. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia:
The Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis (concerning assassins and sorcerers) was passed in the time of Sulla (82 B.C.) .... This law contained provisions as to death or fire caused by dolus malus (evil fraud) and against persons going about armed with the intention of killing or thieving. The law not only provided for cases of poisoning, but contained provisions against those who made, sold, bought, possessed, or gave poison for the purpose of poisoning;...
While scholars and digital historiography (Wikipedia) largely view the earliest attestations for exorcism in Roman sources as deriving from reports by Josephus of the use of poisonous herbs and, in some cases, sacrifices, that bring about the magical effect of exorcism (Jewish War, vii. 6, § 3). and the practice is also attested in the Dead Sea Scrolls, there is arguably a tradition of exorcism associated with the practices of sages in ancient Greece. The most notable example of this is reported in Herodotus concerning the Arcadian prophet Bakis, about which more will be discussed below. The point is this: exorcism, particularly as presented in the New Testament texts, should not be viewed as solely a Semitic magical practice.[ref]for primary source references attesting to legends surrounding the Bakis figure see: Herodotus viii. 20, 77, ix. 43 and Pausanias iv. 27, ix. 17, x. 12[/ref]
In 2008, the British Museum undertook an exhibit called Hadrian: Empire and Conflict. One of the smaller artifacts displayed in public for the first time was a papyrus fragment from the Bodleian Library containing what appears to be a pupil’s copy of part of the Emperor Hadrian’s autobiography [ref]PFayum 19, found at Umm el’Atl, 1897.[/ref]. This autobiography is described as written by Hadrain in the form of letters to his adopted son and heir Antoninus Pius, that is to say, Hadrian’s autobiography, like large sections of the New Testament, is epistolary in form.
This second century papyrus fragment is of importance because of its date and provenance: we may therefore place the fact of an epistolary autobiography of Hadrian within a generation of his death on the basis, slim though it is, of a physical artifact. The question of the precise content of Hadrian’s autobiography is, to be sure, a major open question and should rightly be subjected to the strictest criticism and hopefully new finds in Egypt will make our knowledge of Hadrian's autobiographical work clearer.
This said, the evidence that Hadrian chose an epistolary form through which to communicate his life echoes what one encounters in the much debated Historia Augusta, wherein purported letters of Hadrian are cited, one of which appears below:
8 From Hadrian Augustus to Servianus 22 the consul, greeting. The land of Egypt, the praises of which you have been recounting to me, my dear Servianus, I have found to be wholly light-minded, unstable, and blown about by every breath of rumour. 2 There those who worship Serapis are, in fact, Christians, and those who call themselves bishops of Christ are, in fact, devotees of Serapis. 3 There is no chief of the Jewish synagogue, no Samaritan, no Christian presbyter, who is not an astrologer, a soothsayer, or an anointer. 4 Even the Patriarch himself, when



he comes to Egypt, is forced by some to worship Serapis, by others to worship Christ. 5 They are a folk most seditious, most deceitful, most given to injury; but their city is prosperous, rich, and fruitful, and in it no one is idle. 6 Some are blowers of glass, others makers of paper, all are at least weavers of linen23 or seem to belong to one craft or another; the lame have their occupations, the eunuchs have theirs, the blind have theirs, and not even those whose hands are crippled are idle. 7 Their only god is money, and this the Christians, the Jews, and, in fact, all nations adore. And would that this city had a better character, for indeed it is worthy by reason of its richness and by reason of its size to hold the chief place in the whole of Egypt. 8 I granted it every favour, I restored to it all its ancient rights and bestowed on it new ones besides, so that the people gave thanks to me while I was present among them. Then, no sooner had I departed thence than they said many things against my son Verus,24 and what they said about Antinous25 I believe you have learned. 9 I can only wish for them that they may live on their own chickens, which they breed in a fashion I am ashamed to describe.26 10 I am sending you over some cups, changing colour27 and variegated, presented to me by the priest of a temple and now dedicated particularly to you and my sister. I should like you to use them at banquets on feast-days. Take good care, however, that our dear Africanus28 does not use them too freely." [ref]Historia Augusta: dated conventionally to fourth century CE.[/ref]
The current scholarly consensus dates the Historia Augusta to the mid or late fourth century CE. There is little internal evidence that the main hand of the compiler lived during the times his work purportedly treats. Extreme caution should be used in wrestling facts from such a source and most scholars chose not to wade into the historical rip-currents of such a textual tradition. This said, it is also recognized that the Historia Augusta contains much that is historic in nature with respect to the description of the social milieu of the Roman world and in this respect the Historia Augusta has much to offer.
We will leave aside for the moment the fact that the Historia Augusta is also a most excellent example of that genre of chronicle painting a picture of events that occurred a century prior to when it was compiled, yet giving the impression of being a contemporaneous record, much like the present evidence we have for the New Testament.
This passage from the Historia Augusta is the source of much confusion and debate, particularly within the somewhat arbitrarily regulated badlands of digital historiography (see Wikipedia on Serapis as one example).
One of the principal and unfounded assumptions preventing an objective analysis of the text, results from the near-unanimous agreement that references within the letter that people made to worship a Christ are worshiping the Jesus Christ of the gospels. The letter, whatever its provenance, arguably says nothing of the sort.
Rather, Hadrian, or the would-be Hadrian of the letter, is discussing the practice of popular, we could even say vulgar, low-magic in association with the high cultic theurgy of the religions mentioned in the narrative: Serapism and Judaism principally. The higher social office described as bishop of Christ is reported in the letter as actually occupied by a devotee of Serapis. Moreover, the Jewish synagogue chiefs, as well as the lower offices of Christian presbyter and the entire class of Samaritans, are reported as being engaged wholesale in the practice of low-magic: astrology, soothsaying, and anointing.
To put it simply, taking the sum contexts of the Panhellenic textual and archaeological record, we must envision an Alexandria wherein the high temples and houses of worship were the centers of an entire solar system, so to speak of both dependent and freelance diviners and declarers of oracles. These menteis could be priests and alcolytes, or, as in the Historia Augusta, they could be the local glassblower or fishmonger with a knack for magic arts. At the street- or market-place level, perhaps even in the plazas fronting the temple compounds, the business of religion heavily depended on magic and the business of magic depended just as heavily on money.[ref]Sarah Iles Johnson, Ancient Greek Divination (2008), pp.137-141[/ref]
It is not yet well-understood the degree to which the secret and semi-secret societies of the menteis



cooperated or, as the case may be, competed, with the theurgy and sacrificial ritual and business of the high temples. Pliny's letter suggests direct competition at the expense of temple worship; the Historia Augusta suggests otherwise. The period appears to be characterized by a highly varied and fluid set of relationships between high and low magic. One aspect is also important to hold in view: as mentioned above, these freelance oracles could be honorable practitioners of divination, or they could be corrupt.
The question of the Patriarch is, in light of the above discussion, perhaps less puzzling than it needs to be: he was likely as not participating not only in the theurgy of his higher office, but also mixing with the chresmologoi of Alexandria as well. It therefore remains to be demonstrated whether there is any real contradiction in the behavior of religious officers described in the Historia Augusta at all. The menteis and chresmologoi, if the textual and archaeological artifacts are examined, evidence working through a wide variety of daimones (non-perjorative Greek term), Greco-Roman, Egyptian, and Judaic, and often simultaneously in the same spell, amulet, or hymn.
Before moving on, and against the backdrop of the polyglot chresmologic market-place that was Alexandria, we should perhaps keep in mind that when a writer or reference seeks to speak of the early second century and certainly the whole of the first century CE, and uses the term Christian and further references what appear superficially Christian offices, there is no indication that these are terms and offices as the post-Constantinian world understand them, nor may it be accurately asserted that such offices during this time period have any link to the Jesus-centered Christian church with fully developed New Testament canonical Gospels.
To close this part of the discussion let us examine a small but important papyri artifact from the second century, which may be firmly dated and represents one of the earliest uses of the lexeme epikopos as an office with legal responsibilities over the care of a flock in the Roman Near East.
An orphan Jesus as hostage
Bishop or episkopos (επισκοπος) in the first quarter of second century appears to have no link at all to either Jesus or the Christian church focused on Jesus. Our earliest attested use of the term episkopos in a second century papyrus comes to us from the cave letters of Babatha wherein one Julia Crispina, a Hellenized Romano-Jewish noblewoman, appears before the governor of Roman Arabia in the capacity of guardian or overseer of an orphan named Jesus.
The Babatha Archive, 93-132 CE



In 1961, Prof. Yigael Yadin discovered a cache of 37 papyri documents in a cave in Nahal Hever. The documents belonged to a Jewish woman named Babatha and her family. They were written in Greek, Nabatean and Aramaic. They were apparently placed in the cave for safekeeping during the Bar Kokhba Revolt.
In these documents we are informed that the unnamed nephews of Babatha's second husband, who are designated "the orphans" in the documents, were represented in court in their claims against Babatha by two guardians: one, Besas son of Jesus, a Jew from Ein Gedi, termed epitropos (guardian) (Documents 20, 23, 24, and 25), and the other a woman, Julia Crispina, the episkopos (επισκοπος), “overseer” of the orphans of Jesus son of
Khthousion.[ref]Hannah M. Cotton, Courtyard(s) in Ein-gedi: P.Yadin 11, 19 and 20 of the Babatha Archive, Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, Bd. 112, (1996), pp. 197-201 [/ref]
The latest documents discovered in the pouch concern a summons to appear in an Ein Gedi court as Judah’s first wife, Miriam, had brought a dispute against Babatha regarding their late husband’s property. Therefore, it is assumed that Babatha was near Ein Gedi in 132 CE, placing her in the midst of the Bar Kokhba's revolt. It is likely that Babatha fled with Miriam and her family from the imminent violence of the revolt. Because the documents were never retrieved and because twenty skeletal remains were found nearby, historians have suggested that Babatha perished while taking refuge in the cave.(Freund, 201.)
It is not unreasonable to understand Julia Crispina’s charges to be in the character of Roman hostages taken from the local nobility and being raised in a fundamentally Panhellenic and syncretic program of education. If so, then this follows the pattern set by Antonia Minor, with the numerous children of provincial royalty.
Pater Familias
Pliny the Younger’s letters to Trajan while serving as governor of Bithyinia concerning Christians are also useful for framing the Hadrian letter in proper context. Here again we encounter not men holding church office, but women. Pliny finds two deaconesses who preside over a loose congregation of individuals from the peasantry, practising what is likely low magic and which has nothing at all to do with Jesus. An excerpt from the relevant passage follows:
Still others there were, whose names were supplied by an informer. These first said they were Christians, then denied it, insisting they had been, "but were so no longer"; some of them having "recanted many years ago," and more than one "full twenty years back." These all worshiped your image and the god's statues and cursed the name of Christ.
But they declared their guilt or error was simply this -- on a fixed day they used to meet before dawn and recite a hymn among themselves to Christ, as though he were a god. So far from binding themselves by oath to commit any crime, they swore to keep from theft, robbery, adultery, breach of faith, and not to deny any trust money deposited with them when called upon to deliver it. This ceremony over, they used to depart and meet again to take food -- but it was of no special character, and entirely harmless. They also had ceased from this practice after the edict I issued -by which, in accord with your orders, I forbade all secret societies.
I then thought it the more needful to get at the facts behind their statements. Therefore I placed two women, called "deaconesses," under torture, but I found only a debased superstition carried to great lengths, so I postponed my examination, and immediately consulted you. This seems a matter worthy of your prompt consideration, especially as so many people are endangered. Many of all ages and both sexes are put in peril of their lives by their accusers; and the process will go on, for



the contagion of this superstition has spread not merely through the free towns, but into the villages and farms. Still I think it can be halted and things set right. Beyond any doubt, the temples -- which were nigh deserted -- are beginning again to be thronged with worshipers; the sacred rites, which long have lapsed, are now being renewed, and the food for the sacrificial victims is again finding a sale -- though up to recently it had almost no market. So one can safely infer how vast numbers could be reclaimed, if only there were a chance given for repentance. [ref]Pliny, Letters 10.96-97[/ref]
The main points to be stressed are these:
● The oft remarked observation that Jesus is not mentioned, at least one of the Chrestian's testimony pushes the date of the Chrestian secret society’s existence back twenty years from the date of Pliny’s letter. Using the traditional date assigned to the letter circa 112 CE, we may presume that Pliny therefore collected testimony dating the secret society into the reign of Domitian, last of the Flavian emperors (81-96 CE). ● These Chrestians are taking pains to present themselves as morally-trustworthy financial fiduciaries – unusual, but consistent with what we know of popular magic in the first and second century. ● That Pliny considered Chrestians to be more of a secret society practicing popular magic (debased superstition carried to great lengths). ● These Chrestians engaged in some form of money handling.
The last section of Pliny’s letter is instructive. We observe again the Neoplatonic distinction between the theurgy of the lawful temple rituals and sacrifices and that of the popular practices of low magic within the population. The Chrestians activities diverted money away from the Panhellenic temples. Certainly whatever the trustee function practiced by these Chrestians, disputes of a monetary nature a rose. Those among the elites vested in the temple economies had reason to inform on this secret society and its members.
Richard Majka, F.R.C., Maenads with the Head of Pentheus, Who Refused to Worship Dionysus, after a bas-relief in the 1st-century Neopythagorean Basilica.[ref]The Neopythagoreans at the Porta Maggiore in Rome by Lisa Spencer, M.A.O.M., S.R.C.[/ref]
This Chrestian movement, its hymn and dance, its communal meal, its moral code, all of which are stressed strongly by traditional scholarship, tends to ignore equally-strong connections these Chrestians



have, as a secret society practicing low-magic, with money and economics.
By way of aside, it justifies remark that in remaking Chrestianity into Jesus Christianity, the textual tradition suppresses the base magic and economic focus of the secret society and stresses those practices that most readily lend themselves to Neoplatonic theurgy and integration with Panhellenism. Needless to say, all of this conforms with concerns addressed in the Apocryphon of John, whose textual tradition, on the basis of internal evidence, is also connected to the period of Domitian’s reign.
This digression into Bithynia is really aimed at taking a text surrounded with much less controversy than the Hadrian letter from the Historia Augusta, and demonstrating that the same essential elements of Chrestianity are present, albeit the context of Alexandria is altogether more complex, it being the site of one of the greatest cosmopolitan centers in the empire.
Like the Pliny letter, Hadrian’s letter describes a secret society whose members have no trouble moving between Panhellenism, Judaism, and Samaritans, let alone any other syncretic theurgic religion between Bactra and Britannia. As in the Pliny letter, there is no great theological reason preventing this from occurring, members seem to be able to recant or be compelled to perform obedience to the religio of the temples and emperor cultus. The major reason for this is that there is no real contradiction between the practice of Neoplatonic theurgy (high-magic) and low-magic as practiced in the populace. In fact, low-magic was a business and a lucrative one as we may see evidenced in Acts 16:16.
While second-century Neoplatonism and polite society certainly frowned on low magic, any pater familias could set up a freedman or two, create the proper social distance, and participate in the trade and traffic of magic.
A Brief Summary of the Second-Century Position
An understanding of the Roman Empire in the second century CE must confront the highly-urban nature of the world glimpsed through the texts that have come down to our modern age. Whether or not the writings are canonical, the Hellenized urban east of the empire exerted a strong gravity on the shape of the narrative form.
It is known that the practice of religion underwent a major revolution during this period: traditionally, history and archaeology imbue the era with the rise of a new high form of monotheism – Christianity. As current history relates the tale, it is heady stuff. A trajectory of development is charted that moves unwavering through the advent of Jesus during the reign of Augustus in the first century, to the crowning moment, literally, when Constantine I makes Christianity the religion of the empire. Let us reflect again for a brief moment on the archaeological evidence for this traditional chronology:
1. We do not yet have first-century papyri discussing Jesus of Nazareth 2. We do have a collection of very important second-century papyri discussing Jesus of Nazareth 3. We have a second-century source in the form of Pliny’s letter to Trajan concerning a secret society engaged in magic, perhaps falling under the general category connotated by the ancient Greek lexeme menteis and more specifically. under the lexeme: chresmologoi. 4. These Chrestians are devoted in some manner to a Christ (not Jesus Christ). 5. These Chrestians adhere to a code of conduct and handle money. 6. Based on the datable evidence, these followers of Christ in this early period are followers or devotees of certain chresmologoi. Othodox Christianity refers to them as apostles; however, in form and function, these individuals, where historical, are more probably xρηστισ (chrestis) :(from Chraoο - to lend). A creditor, lender of money, usurer, a debtor, borrower, a declarer of oracles, prophet. (Source: Rev. John Groves, A Greek and English dictionary,(1828). The connections between lenders of money, debtors, oracles, and prophets, will be developed further in this and later posts. 7. Pliny’s information was obtained through a more rigorous investigation than traditional histories give weight. The governor subjected a large number of inhabitants to examination and test. He also cross-checked this information by extracting testimony through subjecting officers of this



secret society to torture.
Not to belabor the point; however, historians of Christianity generally presume that Pliny was outfoxed to some degree by these clever Christains who did not reveal the full scope of their religion to the Emperor’s man in Bithynia. Yet, we see in the Pliny letter plenty of evidence of lukewarm allegiance and even apostasy on the part of those caught up in the Pliny dragnet. We even have the usual anonymous informants. In short, Pliny’s investigation has every appearance of being both thorough as well as accurate in the quality of its report.
In connection with the Babatha archive containing the role of Julia Crispina episkopos, we can also assert that as late as 132 CE or so, the lexeme episkopos held no particularly Christian religious significance; rather, the office is devoid of overt religious overtones and is associated with the guardianship of widows and orphans (perhaps also hostages of the local nobility). A host of early texts whose traditions lie on less secure ground tend to reinforce rather than weaken this general view of Pliny’s secret society.
For the balance of the first century and the first third of the second, not a single archaeological artifact attests to the existence of Jesus-centered Christianity in the whole of the empire. During this same period no evidence for any of the higher religious offices dedicated specifically to the Christian church are to be found in either the archaeological, or historical record. We are therefore justified on the basis of these conclusions to dispense for the moment with both an historical first-century Jesus and his church.
This juncture is where most critics of traditional Christian origins allow the argument to rest; however, this is also bad historical and archaeological method. Something occurred in the first century CE related directly to the rise of proto-Orthodox Christianity. The task before historians and archaeologists is thus to take the available evidence and allow it to form a shape under its own specific gravity and proper weight, then to develop an hypothesis that subsequent hard archaeological data may modify.
The question becomes: what was this first-century form and how did it transition in the second and third centuries CE into what later periods recognize as Christianity? The heart of this explanation, given the current state of the archaeological evidence, must explain plausibly why second-century Christianity was compelled to invent or develop a first-century prophet or Son of God.
A License to Thrill: Corrupt Oracles and the Religious Crisis of the Flavian and Nerva-Antonine Empire
Licenses for ordaining sanctuaries increased greatly throughout the cities of Greece. These places became havens for debtors against their creditors and for those who were suspected of capital crimes. In this way the wickedness of men was protected by ceremonies of the gods. Tiberius ordered that the cities should send their charters and envoys to the Senate at Rome for confirmation. The Ephesians were first and heard concerning this business; then came the cities and places of Magnesia, Aphrodisia, Stratonicia, Hiero-Caesarea, Cyprus, Pergamum, Smyrna, Tenos, Sardis, Miletus, Crete, and others. An honorable standard was prescribed. They were commanded to erect alters in the temples themselves as a solemn memorial, but they should not, under the pretense of religion, fall into rivalry in so doing. (Tacitus, Annals, 1,3, c. 60-63).
In the Birds of Aristophanes (414 BCE), the character Peisetarios, while performing a consecration sacrifice for his new polis – to use the Greek term that connotates the sacred nature of the city – his priestly function is interrupted repeatedly by a parade of interlopers. One such interloper is described in the text as a “collector/reciter of oracles.”[NOTE] This character is in fact a Greek dramatic representation of a specific type of magician or mentis ubiquitous in the ancient world: Χρησμολογος (chresmologos).
These diviners focused on the interpretation or perhaps also the re-interpretation of past, or ancient oracles. Until very recently, academia has tended to view these specialists with disdain. With rare



exceptions are the various categories of menteis within the ancient world treated as a serious subject. Much of this scholarly attitude perhaps derives from this widely known and quoted scene from Aristophanes:
Peisetarios: That’s in there as well? Chresmologos: Take the papyrus (biblion). Peisetarios: The oracle, I see, doesn’t at all resemble this one, which I wrote down from the words of Apollo: “But when a quack of a fellow shall come uninvited, annoy the sacrificers, and desire to share the inwards, even then must thou strike him between the ribs –“ Chresmologos: I think you are making it up. Peisetarios: Take the papyrus (biblion). “ – and show no mercy even to an eagle ‘midst the clouds, Not if he be Lampon nor if he be the great Diopeithes.” Chresmologos: That’s in there as well? Peisetarios: Take the papyrus (biblion). (translated by Sommerstein, adapted by source author and Lancelotto).
The first major observation to note is that this must have been wonderfully amusing to an Athenian audience of the fifth century BCE and that this passage is from a comedy. The depiction of the chresmologos is a satire of an event so commonplace that the confluence of high theurgy (Peisetarios’ sacrifice on behalf of the polis) with the low freelance divination of the chresmologos angling for a fee, results in successful comedy.
Historians should be warned off of the tendency to take such ancient comedy as the measure of the serious presence and role of high and low magic within Greek and later Panhellenic religion, any more than we in our era would draw historical conclusions of our institutions from televised comedy shows with political and racial themes. That theurgy and divination, particularly chresmologic divination, appear in ancient comedy at all is a sign that the institutions are both very important and facing equally important changes within the culture itself.
The second major observation is that the papyrus used for casting the oracle hawked by the chresmologos in the play derives from Bakis. The sacrifice (Peisetarios) counters with an oracle from a higher authority – Apollo.
All this goes by way of saying that, in ancient society, one could offer priestly sacrifice to a higher god or deity while simultaneously engaging the services of a diviner or mentis without contradiction. It is also equally clear that these freelance magicians were interested in money, in some cases to the point of distraction. As we see in both the Historia Ausgusta and Tacitus, such chronicles contain information that support and mutually contextualize Aristophanes. But let us not leave the fifth century BCE playwright’s work just yet: we must open a small window on Bakis.
Bakis as Ancient Greek byproduct of Chresmologia: Conflation of Seer Legends and Oracle Texts into Divine Men
Bakis appears to originate in a plurality of oracle collections deep in the ancient Greek Iron Age past (8th-6th century BCE), although most ancient writers refer to Bakis in the singular, as if the figure represents a single individual. Herodotus mentions Bakis as the author of several oracles, whereas Aristotle and Plutarch join Bakis in the same phrase with the Sibyl. [NOTE] The evolution of the concept of Bakis appears to originate in several geographic locales and, over time, coalesces into a single divine figure, a wanderer who is both seer and healer. The process through which a legendary authority and the ongoing practice of low magic (symbiotically existing in the vast popular market for magic alongside



temple-centered worship and divination) developed into figures with pseudo-historical lists of sayings and biographies was centuries old by the time the figure of Jesus Christ makes an appearance in the textual record.[Note]
Erwin Rohde, whose writing on ancient Greek culture and literature ranked among the greatest contributions made by continental scholarship during the Victorian age, discusses both the legend of the Arcadian Bakis as well as the role of the mentis in ancient Greek society: The activity of the seer was not confined to foreseeing and foretelling the future. We hear of a “Bakis” who “purified’ and delivered the women of Sparta from an attack of madness that had spread like an epidemic among them. The prophetic sage of Greece must have seen the origin of what later became part of the regular duties of the “seer”: the cure of diseases, especially those of the mind; the averting of evil of every kind by various strange means, and particularly the help and counsel by “purifications” of a religious nature. The gift or art of prophecy, the purification of the “unclean”, the healing of disease, all seem to be derived from one source. Nor can we be long in doubt as to what the single source of this three-fold capacity must have been. The world of invisible spirits surrounding man, which ordinary folk know only by its effects, is familiar and accessible to the ecstatic prophet, the mantis, the spirit –seer. As exorcist he undertakes to heal disease; the Kathartic process is also essentially and originally an exorcism of the baleful influences of the spirit world.

The process of Chresmologic divination, its basis on legendary and oracular texts, its business component, indeed the entire form and function of such chrestic societies, were well-known to Panhellenic Neoplatonists such as Plutarch, and certainly the basis of chresmologia was equally well-known to those early proponents of proto-Orthodox Christianity who received years of schooling as Neoplatonists prior to their involvement with the Jesus cultus.
The regrouping of texts and oracles during the late first and early second century around a Bakis figure such as Jesus represents a continuity with ancient Greek religiion and magic - not a major break as traditional history asserts. The wild card element in a second-century reinvention of a Bakis figure likely rests in the interaction between this Panhellenic folk religion with Judaism.
Chloe, Cephas, Apollo, and Paul: Chresmologoi in the Theurgic Chain of Acts
Given the available hard archaeological data, we may posit that the early Christians were in a fundamental sense chremologoi some comprising secret societies encompassing the functions of a chrestis. That is to say, they engaged in the business of declaring oracles for money and perhaps lending money on the basis of influence of such pronouncements. At least a portion of their clientele derived from this trade.
My colleague has developed a strong sense of the archaeology of Greco-Roman magic and this, to be sure, is a very complicated subject to harness with critical historical and archaeological method. However, for first century Christianity, in the absence of all the traditional identifiers of the high religion, we land in the realm of Greco-Roman folk magic by default and have a duty to investigate such roots and links.
In light of the focus of this discussion, in the Panhellenic world depicted in the New Testament, and Acts in particular, it is fair to assert that the freelance magician (the technical Greek term is mentis/menteis pl.) plays a major role and that the character of Paul is structured upon a chresmologic premise. The texts give the impression that the Apostle characters are doing something fundamentally different from figures such as Simon Magus and the slave possessed by the Pythian spirit, but this is not really the case. The apostles are diviners, declarers of oracles, interpreters of signs. Most significantly, and this they have in common with the Pythia, the apostle characters in the New Testament are arguably chresmologoi who



recast human events in their narrative present against the authority of an oracular tradition embodied in the sage figure of Jesus Christ who is rooted in a narrative past.
The Chresmologues evolved around the use of texts and by texts we mean written, or memorized verses or words. Plato seems to indicate that the chresmologoi were singers of oracles. Though the chresmologoi have a number of sometimes overlapping definitions in the variety of ancient sources, a consistent definition is that these diviners interpreted old, or already-pronounced oracles. Here in this particular expression of Greek divination, we come very close to the fundamental elements of the Chrestis movement: interpreting oracles already spoken by an earlier prophet will firmly enhance and advance the reputation(s) of the chresmologue(s) in the present. In the second-century marketplace for magic and divination, high reputation and prestige equated to financial success in the business of freelance magic.
1 Corinthians
11 For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. 12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and I of Christ. (1 Corinthians 11-13, Douay-Rheims)
Can this passage from 1 Corinthians be read against the historical context of chresmologoi divination? The Chresti secret society in its subsequent texts places in Jesus’ mouth all sorts of handy prophesies the most famous of which occurs in Mark’s little apocalypse where HHI pointed out along with a handful of scholars that the incident could apply to both 70 CE and 132 CE. It is significant that the canonical Gospels retain a certain historically-ambiguous language in many respects, that lends itself ideally to prophesy and divination; we therefore must entertain the possibility that the ambiguity of these pericopes is intentional.
Like any good oracle and this would allow continued use of these texts by the chresmologoi. The 1 Corinthians passage suggests that several factions of chresmologoi whose authorities held substantial, but not necessarily overpowering reputations in the narrative’s historical present (Chloe, Cephas, Apollo, and Paul), were quarreling over prestige, money, and/or followers-market share in Corinth. Ultimately the problem was settled by back-referencing the power of a Christ, or divine authority, based on a Galilean peasant situated one hundred years earlier in the Golden Age of Augustus. That is to say, the texts that flesh this Christ out were written in the second century, for chresmological purposes, to enhance the authority, allure, and market share of the secret society brought to light briefly by Pliny circa 112 CE.
It is not clear at this point in the research what the entities discussed in 1 Cor. 12-13 really represent. Tradition assumes people. All that may be stated with confidence is that these figures perhaps represent multi-fold aspects of chresmological magical practice. That is to suggest that while Chloe, Cephas, Apollo, and Paul, may represent humans, they equally represent the chresmologic or prophetic authority that declares oracles, or speaks through them. The semiotic issue of substance and spirituality in these figures is therefore to be understood, looking at the question from a positive Neoplatonic perspective, as a continuous theurgic chain that is anchored in the physical material world of the human, but extends upward and outward into the a spiritual atmosphere reaching into the heavens (often several realms of heaven).
This is how many of the early and apocryphal traditions of the chrestis contain portrayals of Jesus whose substance and form fluctuates during the narrative. In the Apocryphon of John for example, Jesus changes form, from old man, to child. When John rests on Jesus' breast, Jesus' body transforms in substance from immaterial to stone in a fluctuating cycle. We see in this kind of imagery elements of a theology in development, grounded in a Panhellenic world of theurgy and magic speaking through temple oracles, divinatory statues, certain of their favored menteis, and their followers in a continuum that encompasses the physic and the metaphysic.



What is significant to our understanding of the future development of the Roman Empire and the civilization birthed out of this culture, is that the Paul figure, both a chresmologue and a skilled Neoplatonic theurgist, was instrumental in bringing a significant number of chrestic secret societies in the Panhellenic world under control of a new prophet and divine messenger-god: the pro-Roman Jesus from Galilee.
The Chrestorical Nature of Christian Texts and Chronicles, or History as Chrestory
Professors and students of history are often left without viable explanations for the genre of writing that is first encountered in ancient and medieval history classes. Professors profess to students that these works are historical in nature, but not in the sense the term historical holds in the current century. That is to say, historians readily admit that these early sources, Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Plutarch, Tacitus, etc., are works wherein the presentation of factual human events is, falls short of the Von Rankean element of historical writing that aimed at capturing “wie es eigentlich gewesen.”
The approach to these ancient texts is generally to categorize them as intermediate expressions of fact mixed in varying degrees with mythology and religion, as the case may be. History does not free itself, according to this model, until some point during, or just after, the European Enlightenment. The problem with this view is that we are left with unfortunate circumstance of having to discard a significant percentage of some fifteen to seventeen centuries of historical writings because they do not meet a modern standard of factually-recorded human events.
The point that requires stress is that this discarded percentage of depictions, that percentage containing speeches never spoken, wonders and signs, heavenly portents, etc., is fundamentally important to historians and archaeologists for determining exactly what is historic (in our modern sense), concerning the human events set out in the narrative. It should be observed that the character of these texts, not being entirely historical, not being entirely fictional, and not being entirely religious in character, requires a more unifying and consistent descriptive term that focuses on the one characteristic the histories and chronicles of this long period do have in common: all are to greater or lesser degrees guided by oracular concerns.
This post has been discussing the Greek root chrest and how it rests submerged in the deep substrate of early Christian texts. We have argued that chrest as a lexeme is rooted in the practice of popular magic in the ancient world, particularly in association with secret societies. The meaning of the lexeme itself is clearly related to divination by and interpretation of oracles. The chresmologic art of magic is moreover tied to a textual tradition (written or oral). That is to say, older texts contain words and phrases whose meanings are interpreted anew as the hand of the daimonic (in the Greek sense) or the divine acts anew in present human events as if foretold in the written or oral tradition.
While many writings of the early Christian and medieval periods are certainly Christian in character, they may be more accurately and properly described as chrestian, or chrestic in purpose: this purpose is not to depict the sequence and veracity of human events in an historical sense; rather, the main purpose of such chrestorical works is to chart the sequence and veracity of a divine text as an oracle against which recorded acts are interpreted. Such texts are not histories, neither are they strictly speaking chronicles with quaint religious and mythological divertimentos; they are a form of recorded chrestory. As such and taken as a complete artifact, such texts that rely on a chrestologic approach to recording and explaining human events are chrestorical.

A New Chronology
By John, on May 18th, 2012
(Taken from both a comment to a post and our front page. Here, one may comment. This is a summary and so omits nearly all of the artefactual evidence, as well as the history of most divine men such as Buddha.)
Vitarka Mudra gestures on Indo-Greek coinage. Top: Divinities Tyche and Zeus. Bottom: Depiction of Indo-Greek kings Nicias and Menander II.
We have published very little in quite a while, because once we found that there was no Christianity until Late Antiquity-Early Medieval, it became obvious that we needed a new chronology, which placed Chrest, Gnosticism and Manicheism in their proper context. On one hand, this negates quite a bit of our earlier hypothesising – especially for the second century – whilst demanding a major revision of the history for Classical Antiquity; this is now done.
We have thus moved certain of our articles from the public domain; David and I are working up a new series. This summarises, I believe, our present position:
> The underlying theology of divine men is Pythagorean. This movement seemingly disappears from the view of historians around the time of the Macedonian conquests ascribed traditionally to Alexander III of Macedon, then reappears in the 1st century of the modern era as Neopythagoreanism. I believe we can trace the archaeology of this movement from the Chi-Rho of Ptolemey III to Menander I in Greco-India. Its presence in Greco-India during this period is how it has been ‘missed’.
> The arrival of Scythians in Greco-India changed everything. First, they adopted Pythagoreanism, then they expanded their domain across Central Asia, to include India in the East, to Crimea and Upper Mesopotamia in the West.
> The chronicles of Josephus – upon which both Roman chroniclers and modern historians became overly dependent for their understanding of people and events in the East, especially Parthia and Parthians – contain a number of conflations. These were used to produce religious

syncretisms, such as the ‘history’ of Christianity (the New Testament and the works of the fictive Eusebius of Caesarea).
> Scythians take over the Parthian Empire in the final century of the past era; these become the two competing ‘Arsacid’ dynastic lines.
> There is no Izates, nor Azizus of Emesa – there is no archaeology at all for them. These are Azes, the Scythian king of kings of the first half of the first century – the archaeology for this is reasonably secure. He supports Herod Agrippa I and James the Just, and thus also the ‘Jewish Resistance’ against Agrippa II. Azes is the “Great King of the Peoples Across the Euphrates” to whom MMT is addressed, probably by James at Qumran (the “Teacher of Righteousness”). The archaeology for this is also good.
> The Chrestians of the first century of this era are the result of the Romanising by Antonia Minor of the provincial Levantine royalty; this is the policy of Augustus. One is the Saul of Josephus (as described by Robert Eisenman), who is related to all of them through his Herodian family (via the marriage of General Costobarus with Salome). This group includes Philo, through his brother, the Alabarch.
> One of the conflations within Josephus is between Adiabene of Izates/Azes and Edessa (an Antioch). This becomes the basis for Izates (Azes) conflation with Abgarus. In the late 2nd century, Bardaisan (if that is his real name) builds a textual tradition upon these conflations to the political (and theological) benefit of his friend, the king Abgaros (correct spelling). From this comes the ‘School’ of Bardaisan, which produces the archaeology Dura Parchment 24, the Dura baptistry and Acts of Thomas.
"I S" in Dura parchment 24. Archaeologists agree that this pre-dates the fall of Roman Dura Europos ca 256-7. It describes a scene that later appears in the canonical gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, in w hich "Zebedee and Salome and the w ives of those w ho had follow ed him from Galilee to see the crucified."
> The basic claim of Edessa (Bardaisan) is that Abgaros is the true inheritor of the divinity (king of kings) of Izates/Azes. The two IS characters in the canonical gospels – IS Barabbas and IS Chrest – represent Izates/Azes and the 1st-century king of Edessa, this fable being the explanation of Bardaisan as to how Edessa lost out (unjustly) to Adiabene. It is this scene which is played out in the archaeology of Dura Europos: Dura Parchment 24 and the baptistry, then revised in the Romanised Codex Sinaiticus, with the crucified IS to become later still ‘Jesus Christ’ (and the Isa of the Qur’an).

> The School of Bardaisan probably also transmuted Saul into Paul of Tarsus, Acts of the Apostles and the Chrestian archaeology of Phrygia (and its imperial “Purple Order” which we see also in the archaeology of the church at Megiddo), wrongly ascribed to a fictive Montanus.
> The changes within the Severan dynasty relate directly to the theological developments in Edessa, through Julia Domna, “Caracalla” and successors.
Though the Sassanids take over Iran in this (3rd) century, the Scythians do not disappear, hanging on in Arabia and other regions. Very possibly ‘Arius’ is as fictive as ‘Montanus’ and actually refers to Aria in Central Asia (essentially Bactria); Arian Goths are therefore most likely descended from the Scythians, which is how Arianism enters the Roman Empire.
The theological cauldron in which 3rd-century Chrestianity is brewed is bounded by Adiabene, Edessa and Emesa – Upper Mesopotamia and Syria. It is from here and the School of Bardaisan that Manicheism is propagated and this is taken to Rome by Aurelian and probably Zenobia, where it is picked up by Helena and her husband, the parents of Constantine. There is zero evidence for his Christianity – maybe he became Chrestian.
Christianity begins to appear as Chrest becomes Christ in codex Sinaiticus and the same on the Phrygian monuments. As for the papacy and the great, formal Church of Rome, this appears out of the Roman reaction to Gothic Ravenna. The archaeological record for this is clear and has been ignored.
That’s the outline, which we hope to publish in some form.
Postscript
The above is a reposting of a comment on another article here, which then was reposted to our front page, but as many would not find the comment and the front page changes regularly, it was posted here to my personal blog. As you will probably realise, this is the briefest summary of our present position and not meant to be definitive, fully referenced, or even illustrated.
To those of you who have not studied the Levant in this period, the appearance here of Edessa, Adiabene and Emesa at the heart of the history for the New Testament could be something of a surprise. It is less of a surprise to us here at HHI, because quite early in our study for divine men, the primary sources quickly and consistently took us north of Judea, into Greater Armenia.
This was one of the clues as to how the New Testament story was less about characters in Judea and more about regional politics, which include religion.
Personally, I found persuasive the account by Josephus for this angelic visitation:
Monobazus, the king of Adiabene, who had also the name of Bazeus, fell in love with his sister Helena, and took her to be his wife, and begat her with child. But as he was in bed with her one night, he laid his hand upon his wife’s belly, and fell asleep, and seemed to hear a voice, which bid him take his hand off his wife’s belly, and not hurt the infant that was therein, which, by God’s providence, would be safely born, and have a happy end. This voice put him into disorder; so he awaked immediately, and told the story to his wife; and when his son was born, he called him Izates. (Titus Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews – Book XX Containing the interval of twenty-two years. From Fadus the Procurator to Florus. Chapter 2: How Helena the Queen of Adiabene and her son Izates, embraced the Jewish religion; and how Helena supplied the poor with corn, when there was a great famine at Jerusalem.)
This is too close to the canonical gospel accounts to be coincidental, in my view. Next, as I looked and failed to find any evidence at all for the existence of this famous king Izates, I began to wonder: is he a conflation? Then, after some years, I found him and much to my surprise, he turned out to be Azes, the Scythian king of kings, ruling Greco-India. The archaeology for this is clear, so the next step was to try to understand his identity and importance. The answers to this became the road leading to Pythagoreanism, how the Parthian Empire became Scythian, and how this impacted the Roman Levant.
There has been much scholarly study of the Abgar legends which connect two of the kings of Edessa with (i) the biblical Jesus and (ii) the

origins of Christianity. It is generally agreed how these are legendary rather than historical. What nobody seems to have done is connect the origins of this legend with Bardaisan, whom scholarship regards as a source for gnosticism in general and Manicheism in particular, both of which feature a magical Jesus.
There has been a general failure of scholarship to treat the primary sources properly; instead too much has been accepted at face value, as historical, and judged in a religious manner – heretical, or orthodox/canonical. This is unacceptable in proper scholarship. Time and again, claims in ancient texts to have had access to lost sources is accepted as fact and the contents as historical. Archaeology should treat artefactual evidences, not unsupported claims, and this applies as much to texts as any other.
Understanding the archaeology of Dura Europos is key to understanding Christian origins. Dura Parchment 24 is regarded commonly as part of a Diatessaron, but this is based on the unfounded assumption that it post-dates the New Testament, whose books have not been dated reliably. This fragment illustrates a scene in the domus ecclesiae at Dura Europos and this is a baptistry. They pre-date anything Christian and belong to a milieu encompasing Syria and Edessa at the time of the School of Bardaisan, if not the man himself. Into this scene steps Patik and his son Mani, and the result is Manicheism, which also pre-dates Christianity.
Christianity enters Europe with monasticism from Egypt, though the only monasteries there in this period are Manicheist. In our view, monasticism derives ultimately from Qumran and other Jewish ascetic settlements, via Buddhism in Greco-India, then Manicheism taking the movement westwards to Egypt. There are a number of connections between Judaism and this late Christianity, and none is more important that the conversion of the Scythian royal family – Helen and ‘Izates’ – as described by Josephus and later ‘Christian’ tradition. The studies of Robert Eisenman contain much of relevance here; I suggest this as a starting point:
Robert Eisenman’s James the Brother of Jesus: A Higher-Critical Evaluation, by Robert M. Price
Where did Luke find his raw material for the prophecy of Agabus of a great famine to transpire in Claudius’ reign, of Paul’s trip from Antioch to deliver famine relief funds to Jerusalem, and for the earlier tale of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch? Again, from Josephus (though perhaps also from other cognate sources of information). It all stems, by hook and by crook, from the story of Helen, Queen of Adiabene, a realm contiguous and/or overlapping with Edessa, whose king Agbar/Abgarus some sources make Helen’s husband. Helen and her son Izates converted to Judaism, though initially Izates refrained from circumcision on the counsel of an unnamed Jewish teacher who assured him the worship of God was more important than circumcision. His mother, too, advised against it, since his subjects might resent his embracing of such alien customs. But soon a stricter Jewish teacher from Jerusalem, one Eliezer, visited Izates, finding him poring over the Genesis passage on the Abrahamic covenant of circumcision. Eliezer asked if Izates understood the implications of what he was reading. If he did, then why did he not see the importance of being circumcised? And this the prince then agreed to do. Helen and Izates proved the sincerity of their conversion by, among other philanthropies, sending agents to Egypt and Cyrene to buy grain during the Claudius famine and to distribute it to the poor in Jerusalem.
These events have left their mark in the New Testament as follows. Eisenman notes (as of course all commentators do) that there is no room for the famine relief visit in Galatians’ itinerary of Paul’s visits to Jerusalem, but he ventures to place the event during Paul’s sojourn in “Arabia,” which in the parlance of the time could include Edessa/Adiabene. Acts knows two Antiochs, those in Pisidia and Syria, but there were others, including Edessa! Eisenman identifies Paul as the first Jewish teacher who tells Izates he need not be circumcised if he has faith in God. (This episode also lies at the basis of the Antioch episode recounted in Galatians, when certain men from James arrived in Antioch to tell Paul’s converts they must be circumcised after all.) Paul is one of Helen’s agents to bring famine relief to Jerusalem, which he is said to do “from Antioch,” in Acts 11.
The IS character and his story appearing in Dura Europos in the early 3rd century is probably not yet the fully-Romanised version we have in

the New Testament – Codex Sinaiticus. One may argue the exact date for this codex – perhaps it is 4th century as most scholars seem to think, though I suggest we keep open the possibility for a later date. Personally, I think scholarship may be skewed on this date because of the tendency to accept the tradition for Constantine I converting to Christianity. Once that false assumption is exposed, then I suggest the date for the codex could move forward in time. What is certain is the there are many important texts needing to be dated reliably – that they have not been is very telling of the character of ‘biblical scholarship’.
The summary offered here builds upon articles posted earlier and the most relevant are listed, below. They and the comments added by us lead us to the start of this post. Most notably, they described how there is no Christianity in the early centuries of the modern era, yet there is a ‘Chrestian’ movement visible in the archaeological record from the early first century and this is not Jewish, but Roman and culturally Greek (panhellenistic). The Saul of Josephus becomes the Saul and Paul of Tarsus in the New Testament; this is described nicely here.
In future, I will have something to say about a new genre of religious conversion literature that I identify, which includes Acts of Paul and Thecla, Life of Apollonius of Tyna, Acts of Thomas and Acts of the Apostles. This seems to be based – chronologically at least – on the conversion accounts in Josephus.
It seems odd, perhaps, to look back from the 21st century to a time when the affairs of city states became so important to their leaders that they could and would invent genealogies and even a new form of literature to try to justify their pretensions on such a grand scale. The point of the IS of Baidaisan is revealed in the selection – by the Jews – of IS Barabbas (Son of the Father) to be saved and the other IS to be crucified. Now, if we had the larger text from which our fragment comes, we would likely see revealed the full character of his creation, which we may expect to not be the identical twin of IS XP in the 4th century.
Azes clearly then made an enormous impact beyond his immediate domain, which had grown to become an empire stretching from the Indian subcontinent to the Crimea and into Syria, and Arabia. His dalliance with Judaism and the syncretisms with his native shamanism resulted in the appearance of new religions, for we cannot ignore the appearance of Buddhism and Islam; he also gave hope to the Jewish Resistance, though this could be viewed as a false dawn which led to the destruction of Jerusalem and Second Temple Judaism.

Detail from a late Greek magical scroll
Few today are comfortable with associating their faith with magic. Christian Churches in the liberal democracies seem to distance themselves from exorcism, for example, and stress faith in the divine, rather than a resurrected Christ with his associated miracles. Such is our VecXOaU age, largely divorced from its history.
Much of the field of inquiry regarding Christian origins was abandoned to Schools of Divinity, or scholars whose roots drew deep and early sustenance from pedagogical concepts that take certain facts regarding the rise of Christianity for granted. The most significant of these concepts and the most far-reaching in historical impact on our western European civilization is the notion that there existed an historical figure Jesus the Christ in the first century of the current era. Of course it is equally important to remark that in taking for granted the position that Jesus Christ was not a first century historical person does not imply that Christianity itself was not an historical phenomenon; it was, the archaeological record since the second century supports this conclusion; however, the first century is an entirely different matter with respect to interpretation of the available evidence. Scholars are perforce confronted with the issue of when Christianity became Jesus Christianity. Prior to the second century of our common era, the ancient written record is replete with numerous christs in a variety of shapes, sizes, and flavors.

The legitimate use of sacramentals, as long as one has the proper disposition, is encouraged in traditional Christianity. The crucifix is considered a powerful apotropaic against demons and fallen spirits, and rosaries or St. Christopher medallions are frequently hung on rearview mirrors of vehicles in Christian cultures as a way of invoking God's protection during travel. The Crucifix is one of the key sacramentals used by Catholics and has been used to ward off evil for centuries.
It has been a common belief that both people and things, such as stones, may contain a spirit, or demon.
Demons are also a common instrument of magical influence. Now, demons are also surrounded by prohibitions; they too are separated and live in a world apart. Indeed, it is often difficult to distinguish them from gods proper. Besides, even in Christianity, is not the devil a fallen god? And apart from his origins, does he not have a religious character, simply because the hell of which he is the keeper is an indispensable part in the machinery of the Christian religion? The magician can invoke regular and official deities. Sometimes these are gods of a foreign people: For example, the Greek magicians called upon Egyptian, Assyrian, or Jewish gods. Sometimes they are even national gods: Hecate and Diana were objects of a magic cult. The Virgin, the Christ, and the saints were used in the same manner by Christian magicians. - Michael Lambek, A reader in the anthropology of religion, Volume 2 of Blackwell anthologies in social and cultural anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell, (2002)
Exorcism (from Late Latin exorcismus, from Greek exork izein – to bind by oath) is the practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person or place which they are believed to have possessed by causing the entity to swear an oath. The term became prominent in
early Christianity from the early second century onward as the casting out of demons. 1 Lay Catholics are not permitted to perform exorcisms, though they can use Holy water, blessed salt and other sacramentals such as the Saint Benedict Medal or the Crucifix for
warding off evil 2.

Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!" "Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!" The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching – and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."
We have been describing resurrection in the second century as using magic, through ritual and prayer, to place the spirit of the dead within statues. This is the mirror of exorcism, for both assume that a supernatural power can be invoked to move a spirit, or demon into and out of things, including people.

Our Lady of Mount Carmel statue in Chile with a Brown Scapular, an example of the use of the scapular in Marian art. The Scapular of St. Michael is a Roman Catholic devotional scapular associated with St. Michael, the Archangel. Pope Pius IX gave this scapular his blessing, though it was first approved formally under Pope Leo XIII, who sanctioned the Archconfraternity of the Scapular of St. Michael. Indulgences were approved by the Congregation of Indulgences in 1903. Each member of the confraternity is invested with the scapular.
A scapular promise historically known as the SabbaWiQe SUiYiOege, was associated with an apocryphal Papal Bull allegedly by Pope John XXII. It states that through her special intercession, on the Saturday following their death, Mary will personally liberate and deliver the souls of devotees out of Purgatory. The Vatican has denied the validity of this document since 1613.

The fRQW aW Whe RRPaQ fRUW Rf RichbRURXgh in Kent, now thought by archaeologists to have been surrounded by a baSWiVWU\. This method of construction is an exception, for most baptismal fonts of Roman Britain are made of lead.
With both exorcism and resurrection using the same magical process, baptism became the ritual linking exorcism to resurrection:
At an appropriate time, shortly before one of the feasts set aside for baptism (Easter or Pentecost or, in sub-Roman Britain, possibly the Epiphany too), those seeking to be baptised became known as competentes, persons by now ‘sufficiently prepared’ to discard the old life and to be born again. The actual baptism, which in Roman Britain would most probably have been personally supervised by a bishop, may have been preceded by exorcism, during which RQe Rf Whe ORZeU gUadeV Rf cOeUg\, exorcista, e[SeOOed aQ\ OiQgeUiQg eYiO VSiUiWV ZiWh SUa\eUV aQd VeW fRUPXOae. For the baptism proper, the competentes, assembled in or by the baptistery, with the bishop, clergy, and their own sponsors, would remove their worldly clothing, and be conducted to the receptacle of water, where the central part of the sacrament would take place. Of the Latin words used to name this receptacle, it is the symbolic fons, ‘fount (of the new Life)’, that has given us our ‘font’. - Charles Thomas, ChUiVWiaQiW\ iQ RRPaQ BUiWaiQ WR AD 500, University of California Press, (1981)
A source of magic formulæ are “tabell defixionum”, thin sheets of lead, inscribed with a curse invoked through a god and nailed into place, often at a place of execution or a grave. The peak of magical activity judging from the popularity of the curses was in the third and fourth centuries CE, coming to a peak just as Christianity was made the state religion of Rome.
Amulets (from Latin amuletum; earliest extant use in Pliny's Natural History published circa 77-79 CE, meaning "an object that protects a person from trouble") are worn to imbue the wearer with the associated powers of the gods.

between certain gemstones and gods has been suggested, for example, Jupiter is represented on milky chalcedony, Sol on heliotrope,
Mars on red jasper, Ceres on green jasper and Bacchus on amethyst. 4
Amulet boxes could also be used, such as the example from part of the TheWfRUd HRaUd, where a gold box intended for suspension around the neck was found to contain sulphur for its apotropaic qualities.
Two pendants from Thetford Hoard, dating from the third to late-4th century CE and now in the British Museum.
The stylistic links between individual items suggest that most were the products of a single workshop, quite possibly in Britain. 5
The Thetford Treasure was associated with a late fourth-century cult of FaXQXV. The treasure itself is clear evidence that, in certain areas, especially in the Romano-British countryside, magical practises were alive and well in the last decades of the fourth century.

Uterine amulets are meant to control contraception and childbirth by "opening" and "closing" the womb with its special "key." On such amulets, the uterus-scene often is accompanied by "orôriouth" which must be the name of the power which controls uterine activities (or of the
uterus itself), and by the "sororoor" formula, whose meaning and function remain unknown. 6 Note the appearance of the Jewish divine name Sabaôth ("(Lord of) Hosts") amidst the Egyptian iconography in the amulet (supra).
Below is the "Oslo Papyrus" (P.Oslo 1 1), a magical papyrus roll consisting of magical recipes especially for love magic. Seven of its columns of text are illustrated in the Egyptian style by figures of the demons invoked. The papyrus also includes "a remedy to prevent
conception, the only one that exists in the world." 7
The exorcism spell in PGM IV lines 3007-86 is well-known for its reference to "Jesus the God of the Hebrews". The photographs of this spell in Deissmann’s Light from the Ancient East shows repeated use of one of the nomina sacra: θς, θν, and θυ for θεος etc., God.
The nomina sacra are generally held by scholars to be of Christian origin, though the nomen sacrum for 'mother' did not appear until the 4th
century CE, 8 all other nomina sacra have been found in Greek manuscripts from the 1st – 3rd centuries CE. We also find in lines 1227-64 of this papyrus another exorcism, with the invocation:
Hail God of Abraham Hail God of Isaac Hail God of Jacob; Jesus Chrestos the Holy Spirit the Son of the Father who is above the Seven who is within the Seven. Bring Iao Sabaoth may your power issue forth from him NN until you drive away this unclean daimon Satan who is in him.

The Paris Magical Papyrus, described in a Harvard lecture 9 by L. Michael White as "a pagan magical cookbook, recipe book, citing the God of the Hebrews with the name Jesu (Jesus) as a special formula for casting out demons"
Where would they get such an idea? Of course it's reflecting what we also see in the gospels tradition. Jesus is a powerful miracle worker, and specifically casts out demons in many cases. But this is also a reflection of the massive amounts of syncretism, interblending of all kinds of religious traditions that we find throughout the ancient world.

1They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes. 2When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him. 3This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain. 4For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. 5Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. 6When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. 7He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!" 8For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"
9Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"
"My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many." 10And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
11A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. 12The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them." 13He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
14Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. 15When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 16Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well. 17Then the people began to plead with Jesus

28When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. 29"What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted. "Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?" 30Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. 31The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
32He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. 33Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demonpossessed men. 34Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.

to leave their region.
18As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demonpossessed begged to go with him. 19Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you." 20So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis[c]how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
White continues:
If you look at it in parallel, they're identically the same story in Mark and Matthew. But the gospel writers have the latitude to put them in different places, to change them internally, to shift the wording. Yes, of course they believed Jesus performed this miracle. But because they believed that, they then used the story to make the theological claims about their faith.
Now, one of the most interesting and famous in this regard is story of the woman with the hemorrhage. A woman had a hemorrhage for 12 years, which is presumably some sort of menstrual disorder. She would have gone to the Asclepius temple and dedicated her uterus to the god, had she been able to. But in fact, what we can see about this story is, Mark has intentionally structured it literarily so that the first part of the miracle is the Jesus version of raising the little girl who died, very much like the Apollonius miracle. It starts off with Jesus on his way to raise this girl who's sick. In Mark, she's not dead yet. In Matthew, she's already dead. But on the way, Jesus dawdles en route, and she dies in the process. And then he doesn't heal her until later in the story.
But in between what slows him down is, while he's on his way, while he's going through the crowds, he feels a tug on his robes, and this dirty old woman with the menstrual disorder (which in most of the ancient world, and especially in Jewish purity laws, would have made her an untouchable, an impure person, something that no self-respecting man would ever touch or allow to touch him; that's the way they're thinking of it), she comes up secretly and tugs on his robe. In Mark, interestingly enough, that's when she's healed, immediately. In Matthew, Matthew makes Jesus turn around and take note of her, and then she gets healed. Matthew reverses the sequence. In Mark, interestingly enough, she basically heals herself, by showing her faith in Jesus. This nameless marginal character becomes a witness to the real identity and power of Jesus.
The miracle story is not interested in whether it ever happened or not. People believed that this sort of miracle happened all the time. In fact, we know these are commonplace miracles. Apollonius performs them. Others perform them. Why not Jesus? The point is that the story is more than just the expectation that it could happen, or that it did happen. It's a statement about their belief in the person who they say made it happen. In other words, the stories are more about the presentation of theology and belief than they are about worrying about reality or non-reality of miracles. And that's how we have to look at miracle stories in the gospels.
Some independent diviners tried to borrow the prestige of institutional oracles. "Belly-talkers" (engastrimuthoi) prophesied via voices coming from their stomachs and were called "pythons," as if to imply kindship to the Delphic Pythia through whom Apollo spoke (Plato, Sophist
252c); Plutarch, on the Obsolescence of Oracles 9.41c). 10
The death of Germanicus, by Nicholas Poussin, laments the passing of Rome's last Republican. He was the son of Antonia Minor, brother of the Emperor Claudius, father of the Emperor Caligula and adopted son and heir to the emperor

Tiberius.
In 19 CE Germanicus died in suspicious circumstances. GeUPaQicXV himself, according to the historian, Tacitus, believed that he had been put under a spell and ‘forensic’ examination of the house revealed evidence of the magic that slew him:
...explorations of the floor and walls brought to light the remains of human bodies, spells, curse tablets, leaden tablets engraved with the name Germanicus, charred and blood-smeared ashes and others of the implements of witchcraft by which it is believed that the living soul can be devoted to the powers of the underworld - Tacitus, Annals 2.69, (trans. Gager)
There was a Roman law specifically against such a magical assassination: the Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis (concerning assassins and sorcerers) was passed in the time of Sulla (82 BCE) and contained provisions as to death or fire caused by dolus malus (evil fraud) and against persons going about armed with the intention of killing or thieving. The law not only provided for cases of poisoning, but contained provisions against those who made, sold, bought, possessed, or gave poison for the purpose of poisoning; also against a magistrate or
senator who conspired in order that a person might be condemned in a judicium publicum (public judgment), etc. 11
The general population largely suspected the emperor Tiberius of arranging the poisoning of Germanicus, whom many regarded as the new Alexander the Great. The magical potions and texts found in his home may well have been his own, for he had made a Latin version, which survives, of Aratus's Phainomena, for which reason he is ranked among Roman writers on astrology. His work was popular enough for scholia to be written on it, which have survived.
Julia Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus (and therefore the granddaughter of Antonia Minor), married her uncle, the emperor Claudius, on New Year’s Day, 49 as part of her scheme to make her son Lucius the new emperor. She quickly eliminated her rival Lollia Paulina and shortly after marrying Claudius, Agrippina charged Paulina with black magic. Paulina did not receive a hearing: her property was confiscated, she left Italy and on Agrippina's orders, committed suicide.
Witch of Endor Archaeology of a first century wizard
Saul and the Witch of Endor by Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen, 1526.
Ventriloquists (engastrimuthoi) are identified as people possessed by ghosts on the strength of a SXda entry that claims that the witch of Endor was a ventriloquist who was possessed by the ghost of Samuel. (pp. 31, 151) Erotic spells are connected with ghosts in an even more tenuous fashion: "the beloved [is] made to toss and turn without sleep (like a restless ghost?) until she gratifies her lover." (p. 234) O. concludes that the blood smeared on the curse tablets addressed to the gods below found in the house of Germanicus means that they are "associated with cadaverous material so as to enlist a ghost for their activation." (p. 217) Although some curse tablets do make use of spirits of the dead, others invoke gods and daimons instead, and the mere presence of blood in a magic ritual is not sufficient to show that a ghost is the operative agent. - Daniel Ogden, Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds.

Apollonius of Tyana (left) was a charismatic teacher and miracle worker who exists in the history of the first century. With MRdeUaWXV Rf GadeV, he was one of the most important members of the NeRS\WhagRUeaQ school at that time.
Apollonius began a five year silence at about the age of 20, and after the completion of this silence travelled to Mesopotamia and Iran. Philostratus also mentions emperors Nero, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerva at various points throughout Apollonius’ life. Given this information, a timeline of roughly the years 15–98 CE can be established for his adult life.
We have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (On sacrifices) where he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving QRXV (intellect), because he himself is
pure nous and nous is also the greatest faculty of humankind. 12
The New Testament makes mention of the nous or noos in Romans 7:23, 12:2; 1 Corinthians 14:14, 14:19; Ephesians 4:17, 4:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:2; and Revelation 17:9. The Form of the Good or "The Idea of the Good" in Plato's philosophy was identified with God by AXgXVWiQe Rf HiSSR.
In 1915 a VXbWeUUaQeaQ baViOica (right) was discovered near PRUWa MaggiRUe on Via Praenestina in Rome where Neopythagoreans held their meetings in the first century. The groundplan shows a basilica with three naves and an apse similarly to early Christian basilicas that appeared only much later in the 4th century.
The church is about 200 m from the burial of slaves and freedmen of the house Statilius, who was a member of the Gens Statilia and who owned the area since the time of Augustus to Nero.
Titus Statilius Taurus (IV) was the eldest son of Titus Statilius Taurus (III) probably by Valeria, daughter of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. He was brother to Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus (consul 45 CE). This Taurus served as proconsul of Africa from 51 to 53 CE.
Left: Titus Statilius Taurus I from Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum.
A wealthy man, he was accused by Tarquitius Priscus, a former subordinate during his tenure as Proconsul of Africa, of "a few acts of extortion, but particularly ... [of] magical and superstitious practices" [Tacitus, Annals XII.59.1] at the direction of Julia Agrippina, and he committed suicide as a result of these accusations:
Priscus gained nothing: During the same consulship, Tarquitius Priscus was convicted of extortion on the prosecution of the Bithynians, to the great joy of the senators, who remembered that he had impeached Statilius, his own pro-consul.
Tarquitius Priscus has also been associated with Whe SURShec\ Rf VegRiai:
"Among the collection of documents on limitation in the ‘Corpus agrimensorum Romanorum’, a very rare and strange piece of writing has been handed down as it were by miracle: the fragment, in Latin, of an Etruscan prophecy which is supposed to have been delivered by Vegoia to Arruns Veltumnus. Vegoia was an Etruscan ‘ nymph ’ to whom a part of the Etruscan revelation was attributed. There were libri Vegoici, which were kept together with the libri Sibyllini in the temple to Apollo on the Palatine. As Egeria had inspired Numa, so Vegoia had communicated the secrets of Etruscan discipline to Arruns Veltumnus, who seems to have been a seer or a prince from Clusium. And we know by an elogium from Tarquinia that at the end of the Republic the Haruspex Tarquitius Priscus, who lived in Rome and was a friend of Varro, had produced a poetic or rhythmic edition (‘carminibus edidit') of the religious mysteries which had been revealed to this Arruns, apparently through egoia. It is not impossible that our text goes back to this Latin translation by Tarquitius Priscus; in any case, though it may have been utilized later and partly re-elaborated by a Christian author in general opinion it is held to be on the whole a genuine Etruscan work."
The prophesy of the nymph Vegoia (Latinised form of the name) is bound up in the Gramatici veteres, in a corpus of Roman land surveys. We have a passage in which a divinity, the nymph Vergoia, speaks to Arruns Velturnnus:
You should know that the sea is separated from the earth. When Jupiter claimed the land of Etruria for himself, he decided and commanded the fields to be surveyed and the lands marked out. Knowing the covetousness of man and his worldly greed, he wanted the boundaries of everything to be marked by boundary stones. Those which at any time anyone has placed because of the greed of this eighth – almost the latest – saeculum, arrogating to themselves licence, men with wrongful deceit will violate, touch and move. But if anyone touches or moves a boundary stone, extending his own possessions or diminishing those of someone else, for this crime he will be condemned by the gods. If slaves shall do this, they shall be moved to a lower status by their owner. But if this is done with the knowledge of the master, the household will be immediately uprooted, and the whole of his family will perish. The people responsible will be afflicted by the worst diseases and wounds and their limbs will be weakened. Then even the land will be shaken by storms or whirlwinds and many landslips. The crops will be frequently laid low and cut down by rain and hail, they will

perish in the heat of the summer, they will be killed off by blight. There will be civil strife amongst the people. Know that these things happen, when such crimes are committed. Therefore do not be either a deceitful or treacherous. Place restraint in your heart. ...
A bronze sculpture of a liver called the "Piacenza Liver" was discovered in 1877, and dating to c. 100 BCE, near the town of Piacenza in northern Italy, complete with the name of regions marked on it which were assigned to various gods. It has been connected to the practice of haruspicy, the Etruscan practice of divining by the entrails of sheep. The emperor Claudius was a student of Etruscan and opened a college to preserve and improve their art, which lasted until the reign of Theodosius I. Further evidence has been found of haruspices in Bath, England where the base of a statue was inscribed to honour a god for a haruspex.
One of the important icons found in the basilica was the Medusa heads that were found on the wall and one at the entrance.
A burial urn in Greek marble was found and is now in the Museo delle Terme, which depicts the M\VWeUieV Rf EOeXViV. A servant of the family was named Mystes ("The Initiate" – "initiated into the mysteries") – now a term of Roman Catholic Cardinals:
This custom has been borrowed by Roman Catholic Cardinals along with the term Mystes: "A word or two may be said of the singular practice of closing and subsequently opening the mouth of a newly created cardinal. Like almost everything else connected with the subject, this form had once a real significance, but has become a mere meaningless formality. Some reasonable time was originally allowed to elapse before the pontiff in one consistory formally pronounced the mouth to be opened which he had declared to be closed in a previous consistory. Now the form of opening is pronounced within a few minutes of the form of closing" (Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th ed., "Cardinal").
This "opening the mouth" of new cardinals may derive from the Egyptian "Opening the mouth" ritual involving the symbolic animation of a statue or mummy by magically opening its mouth so that it could breathe and speak. As we noted in ReVXUUecWiRQ iQ Whe VecRQd ceQWXU\:
Under Augustus, “deification by drowning” had provided the rationale for the native hero cults at the temple of Dendur, but Hadrian’s Egyptianising cult of Antinous was extended throughout the empire. The receipt by Antinous of traditional rituals (“opening the mouth") was recorded in hieroglyphs on the last commissioned obelisk, thereafter erected in Rome.
The vaults of this Neopythagorean basilica are decorated with white stuccoes symbolising Neopythagorean beliefs, though its exact
meaning has remained a subject of debate: 13
"Here we have a building, undoubtedly pagan, belonging to the first century after Christ, which already shows, fully developed, the plan of the Christian basilica with a nave and two aisles, separated by pillars supporting arches (Giovannoni in DAP 2.xv.113). This basilica is not mentioned in classical literature, and was quite unexpectedly discovered in 1915. It was reached by a long subterranean passage, with two

lightshafts (which has now been closed up, a new approach having been constructed from the via Praenestina), which led into a square vestibule with a larger shaft. (It was the earth falling into this shaft (which lay right under the Naples railway line) which led to the discovery of the basilica.)"
"The vestibule was decorated with painted stucco; and from it a window over the entrance door threw scanty light into the basilica itself, which was decorated entirely with reliefs in white stucco. The subjects are very varied, and have given rise to much discussion. The basilica can be inferred from them to have served for the meetings of a neo-Pythagorean sect which believed in a future life, as they can all be referred to the adventures of the soul in its passage towards the otherworld, the scene in the apse showing the actual plunge into the purifying flood. The worship was obviously secret: and the building was probably constructed in such a way as to excite as little attention as possible, the piers having been made by excavating pits, which were then filled with concrete. The vaults and arches were supported until the concrete had set on the solid earth (not on scaffolding) which accounts for their irregularity: and it was only afterwards that the earth was cleared out from beneath."
Scholars believe the time frame of the closure of the basilica to have been during the reign of the Emperor Claudius, 41 to 54 CE. Today, the basilica is still mostly intact, but closed to the public.

Neopythagoreanism is the Greek school of philosophy associated most closely in this period with Greek magic.
In their theory of conduct the neo-Pythagoreans attach great importance to personal asceticism, contemplation, and the worship of a purely spiritual deity. At the same time, it is an essential part of their ethical system that freedom from the trammels of matter and final union with God are to be obtained only by invoking the aid of friendly spirits and God-sent men and by thwarting the efforts of malign demons. This latter principle led to the practice of magic and sorcery and eventually to a good deal of charlatanry. - Ethics and religion, NeR-P\WhagRUeaQ PhiORVRSh\, New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia.
Cicero’s comrade, NigidiXV FigXOXV (died 45 BCE), a Roman who had lived at both Alexandria and Rome, and of whom Jerome described as Pythagoricus et magus (placing him into the same category as Simon Magus and the inscriber of the ChUeVW MagXV bRZO), made an attempt to revive Pythagorean doctrines; however the Neopythagorean movement began in earnest in the mid-first century CE. The origin of
the forumla for the Sator Square has been traced to Nigidius Figulus 14 – "The name 'Arepo' [a hapax legomenon, appearing nowhere else in Latin literature] has always been an expository crux. It has recently been equated with the Egyptian sky-god Horus."
The Pater Noster, "Lord's Prayer" is perhaps the best-known prayer in Christianity. Two versions of it occur in the New Testament, one in the Gospel of Matthew 6:9–13 and the other in the Gospel of Luke 11:2–4. 'Our Father' is also a reference to Jupiter, Father of Men and

The Sator Square is a word square containing a Latin palindrome featuring the words SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS written in a square so that they may be read top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, left-to-right, and right-to-left. The earliest known appearance of the square was found in the ruins of Pompeii which was buried in the ash of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE.

If the Sator Square is read boustrophedon, with a reverse in direction, then the words become SATOR OPERA TENET, then the sequence reversed. 15
The oldest known representation of the Sator Square was found in the ruins of Pompeii. Others were found in excavations at Corinium (modern Cirencester in England) and Dura-Europos (in modern Syria). The Corinium example is actually a Rotas Square; its inscription reads ROTAS OPERA TENET AREPO SATOR.
Other Sator Squares are on the wall of the Duomo of Siena and on a memorial. An example of the Sator Square found in Manchester dating
to the 2nd century is considered by some authorities to be one of the earliest pieces of evidence of Christianity in Britain. 16 Like the Corinium square, the Manchester square reads ROTAS OPERA TENET AREPO SATOR.
In Alexandria the Platonist Eudorus (a representative of Middle Platonism) attributed to the Pythagoreans a supreme One, above the two older principles of One and Dyad; he formulated a teleological principle for Platonism, derived from the Theaetetus: "as much as we can,
become like God." 17. This monistic Platonism was developed by the Neopythagoreans: Moderatus of Gades in the first century CE, Nicomachus of Gerasa and Numenius of Apamea in the second century. Their innovations were absorbed into the great Neoplatonic synthesis of Plotinus, and thereafter no distinction can be drawn between Pythagoreans and Neoplatonists. Porphyry and Iamblichus both composed lives of Pythagoras in which he is represented as the source of Platonic philosophy.
Nigidius Figulus is supposed to have foretold the greatness of Octavian, the future Augustus, on the day of his birth. 18 Apuleius records 19 that, by the employment of magic boys (magici pueri), he helped to find a sum of money that had been lost.
This Greco-Alexandrian school of philosophy focused on the Pythagorean rules of life and religious conduct which included vegetarianism, tolerance, mathematics, and metaphysics.
There has been much discussion as to whether the Pythagorean literature which was widely published at the time in Alexandria was the original work of first-century writers or merely reproductions of and commentaries on the older Pythagorean writings. Other important Neopythagoreans include the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa, who wrote about the mystical properties of numbers. In the second century, Numenius of Apamea sought to fuse additional elements of Platonism into Neopythagoreanism, prefiguring the rise of Neoplatonism. - “Neopythagoreanism,” Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition.
Apollonius of Tyana believed that he was the reincarnation of Pythagoras. He has often – in Antiquity and since – been compared, not surprisingly, with Jesus Christ; Eusebius of Caesarea, Contra Hieroclem discusses the claim.
Though primary source material for him is scarce and the most detailed account comes from Life of Apollonius by Philostratus (whose patron was Julia Domna (170-217) of Emesa, wife of the Roman Emperor Lucius Septimus Severus – we mentioned these two in Romans at Stonehenge: from standing stones to cosmic pillars), a caUefXO eYaOXaWiRQ Rf Whe VRXUceV has produced the following elements as almost certain:
Apollonius was considered a magician. Independent confirmation: it is taken for granted by Cassius Dio, Lucian (the latter referring to a disciple) and Anastasius Sinaitica. Fourfold attestation: to be found in the Reminiscences of Moeragenes, in the memoirs of Damis, in the Letters of Apollonius, and in the Antiochene tradition. Embarrassment: Philostratus clearly felt uncomfortable with this, and three times offers apologies.
Apollonius performed healings. Independent confirmation: taken for granted by Cassius Dio, Lucian (both referring to Apollonius' disciples) and Anastasius Sinaitica. Fivefold attestation: to be found in the infancy narrative by Maximus of Aegae, in the Tyanean tradition, the story about the plague in Ephesus, the story of the rabies patient in Tarsus, and in Damis.
Apollonius lived in the second half of the first century. Independent confirmation: Lucian mentions a disciple of Apollonius who lived in

the first half of the second century. Sixfold attestation: Moeragenes, Letters of Apollonius (especially 58, a consolation of a Roman governor whose governorship can be dated in 82/83), Damis, Anastasius Sinaitica, mentioned by one Domninus. Consistency: Apollonius must have been a contemporary of Euphrates of Tyre (and Domitian).
Apollonius was a neo-Pythagorean philosopher. Independent attestation: Lucian, Life of Alexander. Fourfold attestation: to be found in the Letters of Apollonius, implied in the title of one Apollonius' publications, to be found in Damis, which presupposes a conflict with Stoicism and Cynicism. Consistency: the ideas expressed in the fragment of On sacrifices resemble what is known of first century Pythagoreanism.
Apollonius wrote a book On sacrifices. This cannot be established by the criteria used, but it is quoted by Porphyry.
Apollonius wrote a book On astrology. Twofold attestation: On astrology is mentioned by Moeragenes and Damis. Embarrassment: Philostratus expresses his disbelief about the existence of On astrology.

His cult no doubt owed some of its popularity to his ability to overpower malevolent spirits, as described in Vita Apollonii and this compares with the exorcism accounts of Jesus Christ in the New Testament:
One feature or other of VA 4.20 has attracted attention in a variety of studies of Jesus’ exorcisms. Nevertheless, because these studies have tended to operate at a relatively high level of abstraction (e.g., comparing Jesus and Apollonius in general as exemplars of the divine man construct), none of them to my knowledge has compared this story in a systematic fashion with the Synoptic unit about the Gerasene demoniac in particular. The following survey of the parallels between the two gives a generally accurate sense of the Philostratean story’s plot.
First, like the demoniac in the Lucan account, the youth healed by Apollonius is characterised as not merely afflicted by a demon but actually indwelt and thus possessed by one. Second, both narratives include features that emphasise the severity of the demon's ill-effects on the victim. Third, in each case the demon manifests its presence partly through the loudness of
the utterances it inspires. Fourth, both narratives contain a reference to the demon driving its victim, with the verb serving to denote the process in both cases. Fifth, like the demons in Luke’s story, the evil spirit in VA 4.20 is described not only as being expelled from its victim but also as acknowledging beforehand its inferiority vis-A-vis the exorcist. Sixth, in both cases, the method of healing consists chiefly of verbal command. Seventh, the agent of possession is portrayed in both accounts as visibly affecting a material object in the immediate environment of its departure. Eighth, the narrator of each account represents the healing as an instance of dramatic reversal. Ninth, both patients undergo a change in their mode of dress as a consequence of the healing. And finally, the teaching and values of the healer are adopted by the former demoniac in each case as further evidence of the healing’s success. - Todd Klutz, The exorcism stories in Luke-Acts: a sociostylistic reading, Volume 129 of Society for New Testament Studies Monograph Series, Cambridge University Press (2004)

We therefore have archaeology 20 for a second-century 21 Jesus Christ performing the exorcisms of the first-century Apollonius of Tyana. The former is a part of our cultural heritage, the latter a figure from history.
In AUchaeRORg\ Rf fiUVW-ceQWXU\ Zi]aUdV, I wrote:
Many of their concepts derived from a fusion of Hellenic philosophy, Platonic (c. 427–c. 347 BCE), and later, Neoplatonic (ca. 253 CE) concepts with the Old Testament. This was also done by Philo, who had engaged in a similar fusion. (Sethian Gnosticism: a literary history by Dr. John D. Turner, professor of religious studies at the University of Nebraska and well known for his translations of the Nag Hammadi library.)
That gives us some names.
Apollonius of Tyana is one and another is Simon Magus.
Peter's conflict with Simon Magus by Avanzino Nucci, 1620. Simon is on the right, dressed in black.
The canonical Acts of the Apostles tells of a person named Simon Magus practicing magic in the city of Sebaste in Samaria, being converted to Christianity by Philip the Evangelist, but then trying to offer money to the Apostles in exchange for miraculous abilities.
But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the Great Power of God. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. (Acts of the Apostles, verses 8:9-24)
Magic for money was the business of the first-century wizards, the Chrestiani and only through a description of these Chrestians can we access the historical origins of Christianity.
The similarities between Jesus and Apollonius of Tyana are significant and don't warrant Evans's scornful dismissal. Although both men came from different religious, economic and social backgrounds, the fact of such startling similarities in how they came to be
conceptualised as divine mediator figures cannot be put down to coincidence or conceptual plagiarism. 22
The historical Apollonius of Tyana and the archaeology of the Neopythagorean basilica in Rome, both existing within the WheXUgicaO context of the first century, become foundation stones of the later Roman Church.

I do not understand why more attention has not been by given by scholars to this Jesus Chrest.
Your posts make many references to Chrest and the Chrestiani of the first century. Where are they in the history books?

Detail of the 2nd Medicean manuscript of Tacitus (Codex Mediceus 68 II fol. 38 r: Annales 15:44.). showing the word Christianos.
The large gap between the 'i' and 's' has been highlighted; under ultraviolet light an 'e' is visible in the gap, replacing the 'i'.
Scholarship has not had the means of dealing with Chrest and the Chrestiani, for scholarship has been largely Christian and
existing within a Christian landscape. Today, most relevant scholarship exists within the theological community and they are less
able to deal with chrestology than our Victorian predecessors.
My personal view is that centuries of Christian, textual fraud have been matched by - I shall call it intellectual dishonesty - in the
last century or so. The truth is that much scholarship disgusts me and the institutions which support it I would sweep clean.
Have you seen the texts written by Josephus? Know anyone who has? What did he actually write: here is a discussion
The new complete work s of Josephus By Flavius Josephus, William Whiston, Paul L. Maier
...Greeks and Romans, who knew nothing of this: but knew very well that an eminent person, living in Judea, whose name was
Jesus Chrest, or Jesus Christ, had founded a new and numerous sect, which took the latter of those names, and were everywhere,
from him, called Chrestians. or Christians...

Detail of the Medicean manuscript showing the word 'Christianos'. The large gap between the 'i' and 's' has been highlighted; under
ultraviolet light an 'e' is visible in the gap, replacing the 'i'
The surviving copies of Tacitus' works derive from two principal manuscripts, known as the Medicean manuscripts, which are held in
the Laurentian Library, and written in Latin. It is the second Medicean manuscript which is the oldest surviving copy of the passage
describing Christians. In this manuscript, the first 'i' of the Christianos is quite distinct in appearance from the second, looking
somewhat smudged, and lacking the long tail of the second 'i'; additionally, there is a large gap between the first 'i' and the
subsequent long s. Georg Andresen was one of the first to comment on the appearance of the first 'i' and subsequent gap,
suggesting in 1902 that the text had been altered, and an 'e' had originally been in the text, rather than this 'i'[Georg Andresen in
Wochenschrift fur klassische Philologie 19, 1902, p. 780f].
In 1950, at Harald Fuchs request, Dr. Teresa Lodi, the director of the Laurentian Library, examined the features of this item of the
manuscript; she concluded that there are still signs of an 'e' being erased, by removal of the upper and lower horizontal portions,
and distortion of the remainder into an 'i'.[Harald Fuchs, Tacitus on the Christians, published in Christian Vigil (1950) volume 4,
number 2, p. 70, note 6] In 2008, Dr. Ida Giovanna Rao, the new head of the Laurentian Library's manuscript office, repeated Lodi's
study, and concluded that it is likely that the 'i' is a correction of some earlier character (like an e), the change being made an

extremely subtle one. Later the same year, it was discovered that under ultraviolet light, an 'e' is clearly visible in the space,
meaning that the passage must originally have referred to chrestianos, a Latinized Greek word which could be interpreted as the
good, after the Greek word χρηστός (chrestos), meaning 'good, useful'.[hWWS://ZZZ.SeUVeXV.WXfWV.edX/h...] "I believe that in our
passage of Tacitus the original reading Chrestianos is the true one" says Professor Robert Renehan, stating that it was "natural for
a Roman to interpret the words [Christus and Christianus] as the similarly-sounding χρηστός".[Robert Renehan, "Christus or
Chrestus in Tacitus?", La Parola del Passato 122 (1968), pp. 368-370]
This problem is not confined to the word for 'Christ': The similarity in pronunciation of the Greek letters eta (η) and iota (ι) led to
frequent confusion of the two letters in later Greek inscriptions and manuscripts. By the late first century AD the Greek letter eta (η)
was pronounced as a long iː[Helmut Rix, Historische Grammatik des Griechischen , Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft,
Darmstadt 2., korr. Auflage, 1992, p. 50.]. eta is used in the word χρηστός, originally meaning 'useful', but also a common name for
slaves. The letter iota as used in the Greek word for Christ (Χριστός) denoted a short i. Thus, the only phonemic difference between
the word χρηστός 'useful' (traditionally transcribed as chrēstos, but pronounced as chriːstos) and the word Χριστός for 'Christ' was
the length of the first vowel. On hearing or reading an unfamiliar word such as 'Christianos', a non-Christian author like Tacitus might
have easily connected that term with the far more common word (and name) χρηστός. Being an educated man, Tacitus (or his
scribe) would then have used the historically correct orthography of that name in Roman letters: "Chrestus" and/or "Chrestianos".
[An instance of the use of the word chrēstos 'useful' as a slave name (Chrestus), written with the Latin letter e in the manuscripts,
can be found in Cicero, cf. Cicero, Epistulae ad familiares, II 8, 1.]
The word Christian/s is in Codex Sinaiticus (in which Christ is abbreviated - see nomina sacra) spelled Chrestian/s in the three
places the word is used. Also in Minuscule 81 this spelling is used in Acts of the Apostles 11:26.[Nestle-Aland, Novum
Testamentum Graece, Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, 26. neu bearbeitete Auflage, 1979]

No scholarly discussion on the history of Chrest and Chrestians, for which we have reliable sources and archaeology, but endless
discussion of the mythical - Christ and Paul.

- The first and second apologies, Justin (Martyr, Saint.), Leslie William Barnard, Issue 56 of Ancient Christian writers, The
Newman Press, 1997
I just love the terms scholars use to hide fakery and fraud - spurious and redaction, for example. Are they just being polite?
So we have scholarly discussions on what an uncertain Justin may have thought of a group for which we have no evidence, on what
this group may have thought of mythic, 1st-century characters. What is the point?
I suggest that the main point of these scholarly discussions is to legitimise their subject, which in an empirical sense is invalid. The
secondary is to move texts further back in time, towards these mythic characters and so give then credibility. In that sense, I agree
with the criticism of intellectual dishonesty, for the basis of much scholarly discussion is false, having the purpose to deceive.
The other scholarly tactic is to isolate the critics and let them shrivel on the vine. Then, in time, they can be dismissed as some
minor, irrelevant and ultimately wrong school of thought. This is what happened to the Tübingen school. It is what is happening to
Robert Eisenman.
This is why I like the archaeological approach being taken here. It has, I hope, a different readership, exists in a different field of
study and, treating artefacts, is less abstract and more empirical.

This is how there has never been a proper debate on the archaeology and history for Chrest and Chrestians in the first century. The
information we have posted here is not new, but either ignored, or misrepresented.
The claim that "Chrest means good" is the most common way out of debate, for it leaves a false set of impressions - that
Chrestians are Christians, that there is first-century archaeology for Christians and that these people are good.
Archaeology and archaeological dating of artefacts provide a very different history, as we are unveiling here. Gnosticism predates
Christianity, Chrestians practice magic, including a ritual for resurrection, and in the second century, these become the earliest
form of Christianity.

A number of Christian customs and myths seem to derive from this Syrian city and in that regard, it may be important that before
Hadrian became emperor, he was governor of Syria (legatus Syriae 117 CE).
According to Philostratus, Apollonius met Damis in a city which Philostratus calls "Old Ninos", which according to Christopher P.
Jones (Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 42 (2001) p. 185-199, especially p. 187-190), is the "holy city" of Hierapolis Bambyce
(Manbij) in Syria.
<img border="0" height="261" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/DemetriusIIICoin.png" width="600">On the
reverse of a coin of Demetrius III Eucaerus, a fish-bodied veiled Atargatis, flank ed by barley stalk s, holds a flower.
Atargatis, in Aramaic ‘Atar‘atah, was a Syrian deity, known to the ancient Greeks by a shortened form of the name, Derceto and as
Dea Syria, "Goddess of Syria", occasionally rendered in one word Deasura. As Ataratha she may be recognized by the self
mutilation of her votaries, recorded in a Christian passage from the Book of the Laws of the Countries, one of the oldest works of
Syriac prose, an early-third-century product of the school of Bar Daisan (Bardesanes):
"In Syria and in Urhâi [Edessa] the men used to castrate themselves in honor of Ataratha. But when King Abgar became a believer,
he commanded that anyone who emasculated himself should have a hand cut off. And from that day to the present no one in Urhâi
emasculates himself anymore." (Chapter 45)
That provides a 'pagan' origin for the Christian belief in self-castration, epitomised by Origen (c.ௗ185–254 CE): Eusebius reported that
Origen, following Matthew 19:12 literally, castrated himself.
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For <font color="#FF0000">some are
eunuchs</font> because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have <font
color="#FF0000">renounced marriage because of the k ingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.</font>"
At Hierapolis Bambyce, on coins of about the fourth century BCE, the legend tr‘th appears, for 'Atar'ate, and tr‘th mnbgyb in a
Nabataean inscription; at Kafr Yassif near Akko an altar is inscribed "to Adado and Atargatis, the gods who listen to prayer", The
full name ‘tr‘th appears on a bilingual inscription found in Palmyra.
In many cases Atargatis, ‘Ashtart, and other goddesses who once had independent cults and mythologies became fused to such
an extent as to be indistinguishable.

Christian apologists try, of course, to discredit this:
"Philostratus was a protégé of the empress Julia Domna, mother of the emperor Caracalla. According to him, she owned the
memoirs of one Damis, an alleged disciple of Apollonius, and gave these to Philostratus as the raw material for a literary treatment.
Some scholars believe the memoirs of Damis are an invention of Philostratus, others think it was a real book forged by someone
else and used by Philostratus. The latter possibility is more likely. In any case it is a literary fake."

"It should be noted that the fact that the Scraps from the manger were given to Philostratus by the empress Julia Domna is
significant too. She was born in a Syrian town named Emesa, which was famous for its cult for a sun god, Elagabal. Now it is very
remarkable that the neo-Pythagorean sage who is described by Damis, worships the Sun. This element is almost absent from
earlier pythagorean works but can be explained when we accept that <font color="#FF0000"> 'Damis' was written in Emesa</font>."
It looks to me that a very great deal of Christian tradition sprang from the sun god of Emesa, thanks to Hadrian.

Archaeology of the μGreat and the Good¶
2
Augustus: the Roman Messiah
By John, on May 5th, 2011
The greatest challenge faced by scholarship in this field is to escape 3the glittering web ́ of false assumptions and rather, to ground think ing within a secure framework of reliable archaeology. This will lead to profound change. The history of the Roman Empire – how it came into being, how it related to both Judaism and the panhellenic world, and how it moved into the Byzantine period – begs revision. The history of divine men has yet to be written. (The vacuum of evidence for pre-4th century Christianity by John Bartram, History Hunters International, 2011)
Here is one, small example.
Julius Caesar (left) became μGod¶ - Divus Iulius – on 1 January 42 BCE and his adopted son, Augustus (right) became the μSon of God¶ – Divi Filius – 15 years later.
As Octavian, the latter had been elected to the College of Pontiffs in 47 BCE and in January of 27 BCE, the Senate gave Octavian the new titles of Augustus and Princeps – that of Augustus was a title of religious rather than political authority.
On 6 March 12 BCE, he took up the position of Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of the collegium of the Pontifices, the most important position in Roman religion.
As Augustus, the emperor unified Church and State, and in a manner a mere king had not. It is this difference and how I interpret it that prompts this post.
It is often said that the history of Europe can be defined by the relationship between Church and State. By μEurope¶ is meant Christendom and the μChurch¶ is also, of course, Christian. It is appropriate that a discussion of Augustus in relation to Church and State makes reference to Christendom.
That the title of Pontiff is now applied to the Pope and the title Son of God is applied to Augustus are observations made so frequently as to be commonplace. They are usually dismissed as of no import, as unrelated to what is described by the Church for both itself and its divine man as its uniquely-special characteristics. In my opinion, this dismissal is wrong and further, hides another truth: that the Emperor Augustus is also a messiah.

The term μMessiah¶ is so heavy with emotional baggage that it will be wise for us to try to take a moderate view. A messiah unifies the offices of priest and king, and need not be Jewish, as we see in this description:
Messiahs appear in many religions including Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In the Hebrew Bible messiahs are priests and kings who were traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil as described in Exodus 30:22-25. The literal translation of the word, messiah (moshiach), is “anointed,” which refers to a ritual of consecrating someone or something by putting holy oil upon it.[1 Sam. 10:1-2] It is used throughout the Jewish Bible in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king,[1 Kings 1:39] Jewish priests,[Lev. 4:3] and prophets,[Isa. 61:1] the Jewish Temple and its utensils,[Ex. 40:9-11] unleavened bread,[Num. 6:15] and a non-Jewish king (Cyrus king of Persia).[Isa. 45:1]
Apotheosis
This is how that last biblical reference puts it: “This is what the LORD says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I tak e hold of to subdue nations before him...“
This is Cyrus the Great (c. 600 BCE or 576 BC–530 BCE), also known as Cyrus II or Cyrus of Persia, founder of the Persian Empire under the Achaemenid dynasty.
His son and successor Cambyses II son conquered Egypt in 525 B.C.E.

The four w inged guardian figure representing Cyrus the Great, a bas-relief found at Pasargadae on top of w hich w as once inscribed in three languages the sentence "I am Cyrus the king, an Achaemenian."
While Cambyses II was in Egypt, the Zoroastrian priests, whom Herodotus called Magi, usurped the throne for one of their own, Gaumata.
The historical account of this is not accepted by some modern historians, who believe that the person who ruled for a few months was the real son of Cyrus, and that the story of his impersonation by a magus was an invention of Darius to justify his seizure of the throne.
“When his brother, king Cambyses, was conquering Egypt, someone calling himself Smerdis rebelled and became sole ruler of the Achaemenid empire after Cambyses¶ had died of natural causes. According to the Behistun inscription, this Smerdis¶ rule started on 11 March 522 BCE, and this is corroborated by the dating of letters in Babylonia; on 1 July he formally became king. The new king was killed, however, by the Persian prince Darius, on 29 September in a stronghold in Media called Sikayauvati.
“Darius states in the Behistun inscription that the man he had now succeeded was not the real Smerdis (who he claims was killed before Cambyses set out for Egypt) and that the rebel was a lookalike named Gaumâta. This man was a Magian and there are some indications that μMagians¶ were not Persians but Medes.” (Livius)
I agree with the view that this Gaumata is inspiration for Siddh?rtha Gautama, the Buddha. What has this to do with Augustus? We will get there shortly.
The process by which first, the pharaohs, then their Iranian conquerors claimed divinity is known as apotheosis: ”to deify”, in Latin deificatio, “to make divine” is the exaltation of a subject to divine level.
Prior to the Hellenistic period, imperial cults were known in Ancient Egypt (pharaohs) and Mesopotamia (since Naram-Sin). From the New Kingdom, all deceased pharaohs were deified as Osiris. (Apotheosis: Wikipedia).
In the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was Philip II of Macedon, who was a king, when the Greeks had set kingship aside, and who had extensive economic and military ties, though largely antagonistic, with Achaemenid Persia, where kings were divine. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip¶s enthroned image was carried in procession among the Olympian gods; “his example at Aigai became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in Greek Asia, from them to Julius Caesar and so to the emperors of Rome”.
Panhellenism
The Iranian conquest of Egypt and then the Macedonian conquest of Iran (with Egypt along the way) is, as I see it, the fulfillment of the desire to become divine. Just as the Iranian kings wanted to become emperors and divine, so did Philip II and Alexander.
We (at History Hunters International) have defined Panhellenism as different to paganism, for although the Greek understanding of μtheos¶ is not Judaic – is not YHW – it can and does at times mean μGod¶. A believer in God is not pagan, in our view.
This brings us to Augustus:
The Greek peninsula came under Roman rule in 146 BCE, Macedonia being a Roman province, while southern Greece came under the surveillance of Macedonia¶s praefect. However, some Greek poleis managed to maintain a partial independence and avoid taxation. The Aegean islands were added to this territory in 133 BCE. Athens and other Greek cities revolted in 88 BCE, and the peninsula was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further, until Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea in 27 BCE.
The how and why of the death of Alexander has continued ever since, with the stronger argument for assassination after his adoption of apotheosis.
Julius Caesar was the first historical Roman to be officially deified and although his temple was not dedicated until after his death, he may have received divine honours during his lifetime. Shortly before his assassination, Mark Antony had been appointed as his flamen (priest).
Neither Greek, nor Roman took to apotheosis of their leader easily.
Augustus is a not a typical Roman: his cultural heritage is Greek. Seutonius:
3 His father Gaius Octavius was from the beginning of his life a man of wealth and repute, and I cannot but wonder that some have said that he too was a money-changer...
Macedonia fell to his lot at the end of his praetorship... he wiped out a band of runaway slaves, refugees from the armies of Spartacus and Catiline, who held possession of the country about Thurii. In governing his province he showed equal justice and

courage; for besides routing the Bessi and the other Thracians in a great battle, his treatment of our allies was such, that Marcus Cicero, in letters which are still in existence, urges and admonishes his brother Quintus, who at the time was serving as proconsular governor4 of Asia with no great credit to himself, to imitate his neighbour Octavius in winning the favour of our allies.
7 In his infancy he was given the surname Thurinus in memory of the home of his ancestors, or else because it was near Thurii that his father Octavius, shortly after the birth of his son, had gained his victory over the runaway slaves.
2 When Caesar, after recovering the Spanish provinces, planned an expedition against the Dacians and then against the Parthians, Augustus, who had been sent on in advance to Apollonia, devoted his leisure to study.
This town in Italy is Greek and “colonists were at length allayed by the oracle of Delphi, which decided that the city had no other founder than Apollo”.
His mother married a former governor of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus, who claimed descent from Alexander the Great.
He was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honour of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, built by Julius Caesar and when Caesar was killed, Octavius was studying and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria.
Herodotus found the Oracle of Dionysus in the land of the Satrians remarkable: “[...] it is a prophetess who utters the oracles, as at Delphi.” The account by Suetonius of the visit paid by his father to the Temple of Dionysus in the Rhodope, where the prophets sat in a roofless oval chamber:
” ... When Octavian, father of Augustus, at the head of his army, came upon the Holy Mount of Dionysus, he consulted the oracle about his son, and the prophets said to him that his son was to rule the world, for as the wine was spilt onto the altar, the smoke rose up above the top of the shrine and even unto heavens, as had happened when Alexander the Great himself had sacrificed upon that same altar.”
This is all, of course, in the same Panhellenistic manner as the numerous tales of Philip and Alexander visiting oracles for divine support of their worldly claims and for their divinity, which is surely the whole point. Vespasian and other, later claimants to the imperial throne did the same – it is such a Panhellenistic tradition as to be expected.
The presence of a statue of Livia, wife of Augustus, in the Villa of the Mysteries, some 400 meters north-west of Pompeii, has caused some historians to declare her to be the owner.
Scene VII in the Villa de Misteri (Pompeii) Initiation into the Dionysian Mysteries: under the imperial purple is probably a Herm, standing in a winnowing fan. The winnowing fan (“líknon” also meaning a “cradle”) featured in the rites accorded Dionysus and in the Eleusinian Mysteries, and in the birth narratives of Sargon the Great, Moses and Jesus.
The villa sustained only minor damage in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE and the majority of its walls, ceilings, and most particularly its frescoes survived largely undamaged. The most common interpretation of the images is scenes of the initiation of a woman into a special cult of Dionysus.
These frescoes are telling us a great deal more than will be mentioned here, at this time – the Herm, for example, coming from Kriophoros Hermes, who becomes the Shepherd of Hermas and the Good Shepherd, the imperial purple and use of the cloth to cover the Herm – suffice to note here how the most elite Romans in the time and place of Augustus are following the Panhellenistic tradition which will become known in the fourth century as Christian.

This history is denied by Christian tradition. For example:
Distinction from “Dei Filius” The term used for Julius Caesar and the deified emperors was “divus”, not “deus¶, the word used for gods such as Jupiter and Mars. Augustus was thus called “Divi Filius”, not “Dei Filius”, the phrase that Christians used of Jesus.
Such arguments are the bread and butter of biblical scholarship and divinity schools. This, however, is both nonsensical and vacuous.
It is nonsensical because it compares apples with oranges: how μSon of God¶ for Augustus was written in the past era, with a later time. Further, in relation to Augustus, the expression is in Latin – Divi Filiu – and when first used for Jesus, in the gospels, it is in Greek and over a century later. By the time μSon of God¶ for Jesus appears in Latin, it is centuries after Augustus.
Even so and ever curious, I checked how μSon of God¶ was used in the Gospel of John within the oldest two codices of the New Testament: Vaticanus and Sinaiticus. (The oldest fragments of this gospel are dated to the reign of Hadrian and we date this gospel as the earliest of the four canonical.)
(You may note, as an aside, how the numbering of the verses does not follow those used in bibles commonly today – I do not know why this is so.)

The answer is shown to be that, instead of spelling out μGod¶, an abbreviation of two Greek letters is used in both codices, so we do not know how μGod¶ is spelled in this Greek gospel.
Official portraits of Augustus made towards the end of his life continued to portray him as a handsome youth, implying that miraculously, he never aged and given that few in his empire had ever seen the emperor, these images sent a distinct message.
The inscription DF came to be used for Augustus and across the Roman dominions, he was regarded as both divine and the μSon of God¶; sometimes he used the term “divi Iuli filius“. Augustus is confirmed as both a historical figure and μSon of God¶, neither of which can be demonstrated for Jesus Christ.
The Latin term “deus¶ is used for gods such as Jupiter, Mars and later, for Jesus Christ, placing him amidst the sky gods of Roman mythology.
King of Kings
Herod was the second son of Antipater the Idumaean and in 43 BCE, following the chaos caused by Antipater offering financial support to Caesar¶s murderers, Antipater was poisoned. Herod, backed by the Roman Army, executed his father¶s murderer.
Though the Edomites and many Nabateans had been converted to Judaism by the Hasmoneans, their status within Judaism was low at best and rejected by many.
Herod was elected “King of the Jews” by the Roman Senate in 40 or 39 BCE. When Herod took the role as sole ruler of Judea, his title became basileus and so he became a Roman client king of Judea.
After the death of Herod in 4 BCE, Judea was added to the province of Syria when Augustus deposed his successor Herod Archelaus for being mentally incompetent. Syria was governed not by a proconsul or legate of Augustus, but a high prefect of the equestrian class. Augustus then combined Samaria, Judea proper and Idumea into Iudaea province under rule of a prefect till 41.
Augustus – the priest-king of Rome, Emperor and μSon of God¶ – not Herod, was the most-high ruler of Judea, the king of kings.
This post is a mere sketch of the theology of Augustus as emperor, pontifex maximus, μSon of God¶ and, in effect as priest and king, messiah.
There is both the history and archaeology of his active interest in Panhellenism to be treated, such as in Thrace and Pontus.
The Augustan Pantheon, rebuilt by Hadrian, is probably the most spectacular and unambiguous demonstration of his Panhellenism.
The image left shows how at the vernal equinox – the date of Easter was set as the first Sunday after the the Paschal Full Moon following the northern hemisphere¶s vernal equinox - the rays of the sun enter through the oculus and illuminate the emperor.
Thus Helios and Augustus unite, as Church and State unite, as a Panhellenistic messiah.

I liked reading this article but I have a very different take. I have written ( http://ranajitpal-jesus-from-a... ) that Amyntas of
Galatia was Jesus whose name was Amen (Rev. iii. 14). This turns Augustus into a villain.

Dear Dr Pal,
Thank you very much for both the attention you give this piece and for your studies, which I find both valuable and refreshing.
You may well be right, that there is a historical basis for Jesus and this is some Phrygian of the last century of the past era. I can
see that such a character would fit well with our view of chrestic history. I will read your article with great interest.
I don't know that Augustus needs to be turned into anything, even a villain: he is what he is and Greco-Roman dynasts did not
have to win popular votes.
All the best,
John

Dear John,Only if you recognize the Jesus Amen of India (Amyntas Nikator), can you recognize St. Thomas who was Hermaeus
Soter. I wish writers such as Robin Lane Fox had been aware of the true quality of their work on Jesus that banishes St. Paul, St.
Thomas, St. Mathew and all the others. I liked his book on Alexander but his 'The Classical World' is very one-sided.

Deiotarus' monogram on the reverse of some coins of Hermaios Soter (Bopearachchi
Série 9B; SNG ANS 1349-50) clearly points to his family links with Deiotarus and his Galatian ancestry. Only the chronological
chaos obscures the possibility that Hermaios was St. Thomas who converted both Gondophares Soter and Kujula Kadphises.
Yavugasa Dharma was a name of Chrstianity which belonged to a slightly earlier era (25 B.C.).

As the Galatian ancestry of Hermaios shows, the term Indo-Greek has been used rather carelessly. If Hermaios was a Galatian,
so was Amyntas who is almost his 'twin' in the coins. In the gospels also Jesus and Thomas are described as 'Twins'.

R. C. Senior has recently revised the date of Gondophares Soter to 20-10 B.C. which is very significant. If one takes
Gondophares Soter Soter as a Christian, Amyntas Nikator and Hermaios Soter whose coins are similar, must also be seen as a
Christians. Senior dates Hermaios to 90-70 B.C. which is far less satisfactory than Sir William Tarn's dating of 40-1 B.C.
Amyntas Nikator was the same as Amyntas of Galatia who had survived crucifixion.

Dear John,
Francesco Carotta has recently focused on the Roman Background of Christianity. I cannot agree with his view that the gospels
grew out of the Julius Caesar myth but in my scheme also Julius Caesar and Cleopatra were the forerunners of Christ. Julius
Caesar must have known Amyntas. King Deiotarus' donning of a supplicant's dress and begging for forgiveness from Julius
Caesar was one of the most dramatic episodes of history. Caesar restored his royal dress but was young Amyntas present at the
occasion? As Cicero reminds us Julius Caesar had reasons to be grateful to Deiotarus, the father of Adobogiona. The fact that
Antony made Amyntas the king of Galatia has to be seen from this perspective. Cicero is recorded to have said to Julius Caesar:
"... for it was king Deiotarus who raised your family, when abject and obscure, from darkness into light. Who ever heard of your
father, or who he was, before they heard whose son-in-law he was?”
I am intrigued. John do you have an opinion on this?

Dear Ranajit,
Sorry I am late here: somehow I have missed the notifications.
I will have to pre-empt some of this discussion, for we are now in a position to name the historical character which became the
Isu Chrest and Is Chrest of Manicheism and the New Testament. We are trying to get out a paper for the Christmas Season.
I have been corresponding with leading numismatists specialising in this period and region, including Bob Senior. My first
comment is that they have missed some archaeology which makes a good identification of an important king of kings; my

second comment is that they are all struggling to understand monarchical naming conventions. A modern example: Prince
Charles is also a Windsor, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall, as well as holding other titles. A royal can be known by various
titles (and these will also be translated into the languages of other nations). Gondophares could be simply 'Lord of Kandahar' or
similar and rather than be strictly a dynastic title (which is the current opinion), may be a title used by an heir, or for a subdomain
of a king of kings. The whole field of Greco-Indian kings (Bacrtria, Parthia, Gandahar etc) in this period is uncertain.
'History' has been dominated by the West, which is to say. a Greco-Roman, classical perspective - as you have pointed out - and
much of the 1st century is drawn on Josephus. This is a very dangerous thing to do, for not only is he a 'player' in these events,
he is both very devious and one of the few survivors to write history. On what basis does the Parthian Empire in the modern era
rest?
Frankly, history for the first five centuries needs a complete revision.

Dear John,
Thanks for your input. I might quote your opinion on Josephus in a paper that I am now writing. But the way the history of the
Indo-Greeks has been written is preposterous. But the rot starts with Jones, then Chandragupta and Asoka. Unless you
recognize them correctly you cannot come to 1st century B.C. with a clean hand. Many of the 'Indo-Greeks', were, in my opinion,
actually 'Indo-Galatians' or 'Syrians'. I have identified Asoka as Diodotus-I Soter, who may have been supported by his master
Antiochus-II Soter who is often called a Syrian king. Asoka refers to Antiuku in a very intimate tone in his edicts. Much is written
about the greatness of Asoka but some mention must be made of the benevolent disposition of Antiochus-II Soter. Can any sane
person miss the religious aura in Hermaus' coins? But which religion can this be other than Christianity? Of course, you can call
it Mahayana Buddhism too. The example of Hermaeus shows how history has been disfigured. I am in close touch with Prof. T.
McEvilley and he also sees the problems in the dating of Jesus Christ.
Best wishes,

Dear Ranajit,
The theological character of Hellenism in Iran is clear, yet obfuscated repeated by many historians. I have lost count, for
example, of the number of times I have read attempts to interpret Soter/Saviour as 'saving a city from an attacker' and other such
military interpretations, when clearly Soter/Saviour is theological in character, as seen much later in the New Testament. This is
why we have begun to use here the term 'Panhellenism' to describe those of Greek culture who clearly are theist. It is such kings
who use the title 'Chrest' meaning 'Good' and this is how the Isa of Manicheism became the Isa Chrest of the gospels, later to be
altered crudely to 'Jesus Christ'.
We have recently published a paper here suggesting that the Edicts of Asoka belong to the 1st century of the modern era and the
author is that character named by Josephus as Izates (Izates II of Adiabene). Eisenman also suggests that it is this Izates who
is addressed in the only letter (MMT) within the Dead Sea Scrolls "To the Great King of the Peoples across the Euphrates".
We here at HHI are now reasonably sure who is this Izates in the archaeological record and intend to publish this identification
soon.
Just as the historical framework of the NT is drawn on Josephus, so too did he provide the elements used much later to construct
'Jesus Christ' - and this 'Izates' character is one of them.

John

Dear John,
Why would you go to Mani, and ignore Mithradates Chrestus who was the elder brother of Mithradates VI Eupator and related to
Adobogiona, the mother of Amyntas or Amen? Amyntas' palace was at Isauria which hints at his name Isa.

Dear Ranajit,
First, we must deal with the question of what is history and what is legend. I attempted to do this for Alexander the Great with my
first posts to HHI. The Greek legend of Isauria derives from the Anabasis Alexandri of Arrian, which belongs to the modern era
and is no more a history of Seleukia and the Successors of Alexander than the NT gospels are a history of Judea and a divine
man of the 1st century. That I mention these two modern sources of cultural legend together is not coincidental, for they are
surely linked.
There is no evidence that any of the authors of 'Alexander histories' in the modern era actually had the sources they claimed.
Alexander was a god in this period, so anything is possible, including the possibility that it was all invented. The Anabasis
Alexandri is now considered to be a reworking of material from Ptolemy: both authors - Arrian and Ptolemy - were close to
Hadrian, who invented a new religion based on the divinity of the catamite (Antinous) he sacrificed in the Nile. It is quite possible
that they all worked together in creating the divine Alexander.
(I could also speculate a little further on the name Arrian, which reminds me of both the speculative bishop Arius of a later period,
and even of Aria, in Greco-India. I would need reliable archaeology to convince me of anything in this period.)
Isauria first appears in the time of Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus, Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, Mark Antony and so on,
and who are the contemporaries of the family/dynasty (parents) of Isa/Izates. In that sense, I would agree with you that quite
possibly there is a connection, though of that century, rather than earlier.
This is the period in which the two opposing parties begin to emerge whose conflict bursts into the flames of the three Jewish
Roman Wars and which eventually gives rise to Chrestianity and then Christianity. These are: (1) the Chrestians, that party of
Antonia Minor and the Alabarch of Alexandria; and (2) the Jewish Resistance to Hellenism in general and the Herodian dynasty in
particular, which gains Izates/Isa as its ally.
That is, Jesus and the Chrestians are two opposing and warring parties, not a divine man named Jesus Christ/Chrest. The Roman
Church (first Chrestian in the 4th century, then Christian in the 5th) is an attempt to merge these two parties, along with a third,
the Religio Romana, the established religious order of Rome. It is in this merger that Hellenistic, royal titles such as Savour, Lord,
Master and Good (Chrest) are taken and applied to Isa, to make Isa the Good of the earliest NT codices, then Jesus Christ.
You are especially good, Ranajit, as seeing past the legend and mythology posing as history, so I expect and hope that you can
see your way out of 'the glittering web' of this period and see divine men such as Alexander and Jesus for what they are.
Kind regards,
John

John, my argument is very simple. The oldest Christian establishments were the churches mentioned by St. Paul at Lystra,
Derbe, Antioch in Pisidia. But there is a haunting presence of one Amen or Amyntas in all these places. Who was this Amyntas
whose palace was at Isauria? Remember Antioch (Pisidian) was the sister city of Lystra and Tavium where Amyntas' father
Brogitarus had his palace. Amyntas was the son of the chief priestess of the holy Pessinus shrine, and thus a legitimate 'son of
god'. Why did Augustus, the false 'son of god' destroy Amyntas' shrine at Antioch (Pisidia) and install his own cult here? S.
Mitchell writes about Amyntas but does not have any clue. Should we all follow him?

Dear Ranajit,
For our discussions to make progress, we have to ground our history in secure archaeology and that means - for a start
not placing our faith in the New Testament as an historical account of 1st-century Judea. Second and as we have stated
repeatedly, we accept here the analysis of Eisenman that "St Paul" is likely the Saul of Josephus and the "Spouter of
Lies" in the Dead Sea Scrolls; that is, there is no "St Paul" - this is a fabrication of a much later date.
Next, as you mention the "oldest Christian establishments", we have not found any clear and reliable archaeological
evidence for Christianity before the 5th century.
A small point: Augustus is not "the false 'son of god'" as you describe him, for the archaeological record is quite clear
that (a) he was the adopted son of Caesar and (b) declared officially divine, which made him the proper Son of God. There
is nothing false about it.
You describe some of the purported "history" - what is the source of this? I ask because earlier I posted: "The Greek
legend of Isauria derives from the Anabasis Alexandri of Arrian, which belongs to the modern era and is no more a history
of Seleukia and the Successors of Alexander than the NT gospels are a history of Judea and a divine man of the 1st
century."
We must be careful to try and avoid discussing legend as if it were history; that's why we take an archaeological
approach.

John

Strabo speaks of two cities, Isaura Palæa, and Isaura Nova and the information has been verified by archaeology. In 266 AD
Trebullian made Isaura his capital, but he was slain the next year. Isaura Nova is now Dorla in the sanjak and vilayet of Koniah.
W. Ramsay discovered there recently more than fifty Greek inscriptions, the greater number Christian, as well as magnificent
tombs.

Augustus was not a son of Julius caesar and thus not a legitimate 'son of god' but Amyntas was the son of the chief priestess of
Pessinus, the holiest shrine in the Roman world..The remains of Amyntas' temple at Antioch and the walls of his Palace at Isaura
have been found by archaeologists.

Dear John,
I found your comment on
> divine men such as Alexander and Jesus<
very interesting. It is well known that Alexander emulated Ammon and Heracles. Ory Amitay has no clue why he also emulated
Hermes and Artemis. Incidentally in the coins of Amyntas of Galatia one finds not only Heracles' lion but also Hermes and
Artemis.

Dear Ranajit,
That's a lot of posts... I will try to answer with one.
Thank you for providing your source. I think one should be careful in just repeating exerts from what are claimed to be ancient
histories, more especially when, as with this one, he has a reputation as a liar; and the medieval texts upon which the later
translations are made do not exist and nor do those texts which the author claims to have based his work. Further, even of we
accepted these texts, the author is renowned for puffery of Greek culture. All in all, I would not assume that we can trust these
texts as good history.

Strabo wrote in the modern era. Ramsay is not "recent" - he died in 1939 - and he made the fundamental error I mentioned
earlier, of assuming that the New Testament was a history of Judea in the early 1st century, which it is not.
As I wrote repeatedly, Augustus was the adopted son of Caesar: "Julius Caesar (left) became μGod¶ - Divus Iulius – on 1 January
42 BCE and his adopted son, Augustus (right) became the μSon of God¶ – Divi Filius – 15 years later." That is official and in
Roman law, legitimate.
I think you have a good point with the son of Cleopatra, only I would expand it. I have a feeling that the Donations of Alexandria
are of fundamental importance to the founding of the Roman Empire.

Eisenman is coy about 'Jesus'. I think he probably accepts (for the wrong reason - James the Just, "brother of the Lord") that
there is some sort of historical Jesus, but does not identify him as a character in the historical record, something I am preparing
to do soon, only not with that name, but that used in (the original Greek of) the NT, in the Manichean texts and the Qur'an:
Is/Isu/Isa.
Kind regards,

Hermes leads one to the great Hermaeus Soter who, I think was none other than St. Thomas. Recently I had the good fortune to
meet Prof. A. K. Narain, the great expert on Indo-Greeks. He is 87 and not in very good health. I showed him my unfinished paper
on Jesus and Hermeus but unfortunately he did not comment on it. He became very agitated but treated me with great kindness.
I was surprised that he did not know about my work on Diodotus-I but when I visited him the next day he comlimented me saying

Dear John,
Sorry for posting the same matter twice. My computer is slow and I had the idea that the first comment did not register. I am a
great admirer of Sir Ronald Syme and he says that the term 'dictator' fits Augustus much better than Julius Caesar and also
that it was Augustus who encouraged the Roman writers to vilify Julius Caesar his 'father'. Ovid did not comply and was banished.
This propaganda misled Shakespeare and many historians.

Book Review: Peter Brown and The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity
By David Pelfrey
Peter Brown’s work, The Cult of the Saints, contains much to recommend to both general reader and specialist. True to form, Brown has delivered a wonderfully written text that is both clear and succinct. This is all the more commendable given the rather esoteric nature of his chosen subject: the rise and function of the veneration of saints in Late Antiquity. Brown has developed a well-honed strategy with which to present such obscure topics in meaningful and condensed fashion: he assigns each chapter of the book a specific task detailing the form and function of the cult of saints as that cult is situated in the cultural landscape. Each chapter moves from a general position with respect to the community and culture and subsequent chapters progressively focuses on the experience of the cult of saints at the community and individual level.
Given the book’s brevity at one hundred and twenty-eight pages of text, Brown is careful to narrow his discussion of the cult of saints to the period bounding the late fourth to the early sixth century CE. One of the masterful strengths of the work is in the choice of primary source material cited as well as the skill with which the translations are rendered. The skill with which this source material is cited and woven into both text render even the more difficult and, to the modern reader, more alien or exotic practices and beliefs associated with the cult easier to follow and discern. This is particularly true with the pivotal chapters on how the cult functioned between individuals and their communities: The Very Special Dead, Praesentia and Potentia, wherein the place and power of the miracle work rendered by operation of the cult is presented by Brown through primary source writings in which the narratives are in the first person and concern first person experiences. Some positive examples of this style may be found in the treatment of Paulinus of Nola and the cultivation of the shrine of Saint Felix. The very
1
illuminating juxtaposition of the arts of healing as described by Gregory of Tours, a Christian Bishop and the therapeutic healer Marcellus are instructive insofar as the complexity of late antique society with respect to the overlapping jurisdictions of divine and secular remedies may be easily compared (particularly with respect to the issue of exorcism).2
This said, there are points with which one may respectfully take issue with some elements of Brown presentation of the phenomenon. Chief among these concerns is exemplified by Brown’s statement that:
The joining of the ecclesiastical hierarchy of western Europe to the tombs of the dead set the medieval Catholic church apart from its Byzantine and Near Eastern neighbors - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim. In Western Europe, the power of the bishop tended to coalesce with the power of the shrine. Elsewhere the shrine tended to go its own way. The great Christian shrines and pilgrimage sites of the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East – even Jerusalem – never mobilized, as they came to be in the west, to form the basis of lasting ecclesiastical power structures. 3
This is true up to a point for Brown nowhere discusses the powerful elements of saintly cults evident in Sufi traditions, neither does he mention the equally strong saintly cult as practiced by the Druze of Lebanon, while each of these elements lay on the fluctuating perimeters of Islam, they deserve mention.
1 Peter Brown, The Cult of Saints: Its Rise and Function in Late Antiquity (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982) pp. 53-57.
2 Ibid. pp. 113-118
3 Ibid. pp. 9-10.



More importantly, Islam cut-off some very large, and perhaps the largest saint shrines during the period Brown treats. One principal example is the Byzantine complex of church monasteries that arose around the pillar of Simeon Stylites in the countryside outside of what is now Aleppo, Syria. The floor plan of this complex is approximately 5000 square meters and places it on a par with the largest ecclesiastical edifices of the age. As is the case with its Western European counterparts, the Church of Simeon Stylites is located some fifteen miles from the nearest city.4
Thus my inquest into popular beliefs in the Late Roman historians ends in reporting that there were no such beliefs. In the fourth and fifth centuries there were of course plenty of beliefs which we historians of the twentieth century would gladly call popular, but the historians of the fourth and fifth centuries never treated any belief as characteristic of the masses and consequently discredited among the elite. Lectures on popular beliefs and Late Roman historians should be severely discouraged. (cited by Brown on p. 19: A. D. Momigliano,” Popular Beliefs and Late Roman Historians, “Studies in Church History, Vol. 8 (Cambridge: At the University Press, 1971) p. 18)
Brown continues:
The model of “popular religion” that is usually presented by scholars of late antiquity has the disadvantage that it assumes that “popular religion” can be understood only from the viewpoint of the elite. “Popular religion is presented in some ways as a diminution, a misconception of a contamination of “ unpopular religion.” Whether it is presented, bluntly, as “popular superstition” or categorized as “lower forms of belief,” it is assumed that “popular religion” exhibits modes of thinking and worshiping that are best intelligible in terms of a failure to be something else (p. 19)
In developing Momigliano’s line of thought, Brown runs the risk of oversimplifying a very complicated socio-cultural situation that obtains during the Late Antique period in the Mediterranean. Popular beliefs did circulate amongst a wide section of the population and some of the material Brown cites supports this very view. In one example from Eunapius of Sardis we have:
For they collected the bones and skulls for criminals who had been put to death for numerous crimes... made them out to be gods, and through that they became better by defiling themselves at their graves. “Martyrs” the dead men were called and ministers of a sort, and ambassadors with the gods to carry men’s prayers.5
Taken with the quote from the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate, Brown is citing sources from the
6
elite strata of society who, while admittedly denigrating the practices involved, nevertheless suggest by language indicating pluralities for all categories discussed, i.e., skulls, bones, criminals, numerous crimes, gods, graves, martyrs, ministers, etc., that indeed a popular practice is being observed, commented on, and discussed; moreover, Momigliano’s point notwithstanding, such practices as Julian and Eunapius outline would certainly have been characteristic of a lower social order and discredited among the elites who attempted to practice them. For further support of this view one may turn to the evidence of the Neoplatonist and theurgist Porphyry.
Porphyry and other Neoplatonists of the third and fourth centuries CE, drew a very hard line between the practice of high theurgy and low magic. Often at stake in these discussions was the question of spiritual free-will. In De Abstinentia, a treatise on abstaining from meat and other impure foods and actions, Porphyry comes to the dividing line between those aspects of ritual cultic behavior that belongs to magicians or enchanters ant that class of higher devotional ritual that belongs to theurgy. In book II, chapter 44 he writes:
44. Thus far what pertains to sacrifices has been elucidated. As we said, however, at first, as it is not entirely necessary, if animals are to be sacrificed, that they are also to be eaten, we shall now show that it is necessary that we should note eat them, though it may be sometimes necessary that they should be sacrificed. For all theologists agree in this, that in sacrifices, which are made for the purpose of averting some evil, the immolated animals are not to be

6 Ibid. p. 7.



tasted, but are to be used as expiations. For, say they, no one should go into the city, nor into his own house, till he has first purified his garments, and his body, in rivers, or some fountain. So that they order those whom they permit to sacrifice, to abstain from the victims, and to purify themselves before they sacrifice by fasting, and especially by abstaining from animals. They add, that purity is the guardian of piety; and is, as it were, a symbol or divine seal, which secures its possessor from the attacks and allurements of evil daemons. For such a one, being contrarily disposed to, and more divine in his operations than those by whom he is attacked, because he is more pure both in his body and in the passions of his sour, remains uninjured, in consequence of being surrounded by purity as with a bulwark.
45. Hence a defence of this kind has appeared to be necessary even to enchanters; though it is not efficacious to them on all occasions. For they invoke evil daemons for lascivious purposes. So that purity does not belong to enchanters [γοης], but to Divine men [Divine Man = θειος ανηρ], and are divinely wise; since it everywhere becomes a guard to those that use it, and conciliates them with a divine nature. 7
The Divine Man is here contrasted by Porphyry with a lower form of spiritualist, the enchanter or magician who “invokes evil daemons for lascivious purposes.” Porphyry emphasizes purity of body and spirit in this passage in
8
contrast with some practitioners of a lower form of magic art that relies on compelling gods and spirits against their natural will. A major element of Neoplatonic theurgy that was adopted by Orthodox Christianity in the Late Antique period was this precise concept of divine purity that prepared the Divine Man to become a sacred receptacle for visitation by gods and spirits. Key to this Neoplatonic theurgy and ritual practice was the idea that the mind-body purity of the Divine Man acted as a natural and non-coerced conduit for bridging the divide between heaven and earth. Even a modest amount of reading in the Neoplatonists of the third century is enough to cast some shade of doubt on the position articulated by Momigliano and supported in some degree by Brown that the elites did not disparage certain forms of religious and magical practices adopted by higher social orders in the empire from the lower. The evolution of Neoplatonism around and into Orthodox Christian theurgy in the liturgy of the Roman mass speaks against such a view. It is possible to argue that the triumph of Orthodox liturgy and theology as expressed by Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine represents just such a victory by the elite class over belief systems present in early Christianity that originated from the lower strata of society.
All of this discussion feeds into a basic element identified by Brown, in the second chapter, A Fine and Private Place, and this is the tension between the pagan community, the family, and the emerging Christian attitudes toward burial. Two essential quotes will suffice to drive the point:
This [tension] seems particularly true in the case of the Christian church in the Latin-speaking world of the late fourth and early fifth centuries. For one generation, a lively debate on “superstition” within the church flickered around the cemeteries of the Mediterranean. In the 380s, Ambrose in Milan, and in the 390s, Augustine in Hippo, attempted to restrict among their Christian congregations certain funerary customs, most notably the habit of feasting at the graves of the dead, either at the family tombs or in the memoriae of the martyrs.9
There was, therefore, a debate around the grave in these years; and it is a debate that was explicitly handled in terms that appear to lend weight to the ‘two tiered” model of religious history that I discussed in the last chapter. For in this case it appears that articulate and cultivated leaders of the Christian church attempted to take a stand against “pre-Christian” practices among their congregations; that the weight of these practices had apparently increased with the conversion of the pagan masses to Christianity; and that the pressure of pagan ways of thinking and worshiping had made itself felt, also, in the ceremonial trappings and in the beliefs surrounding the new cult of martyrs. Seen in this way, the end of the generation say a Pyrrhic victory for the leaders of the church. Pre- Christian practices were controlled among the laity at their own private graves, and the more rambunctious of these were totally excluded from festivals at the graves of the martyrs. Nevertheless, popular opinion had forced on all but a discontented few the frank acceptance of pagan forms of ceremonial and of potentially “superstitious” views on the localization of the soul at the grave in the case of the cult of relics and of the tombs of the saints.10
There are places in Brown’s book were perhaps too much is made of the pagan abhorrence of the
7 A. Taylor, The Selected Works of Porphyry, (T. Rodd: London, 1823) p. 81. Porphyry, De Abstinentia, II: 44-45.

dead. Brown does make the solid point that it was not a question of the dead in general that caused abhorrence among the peoples of antiquity, it was the dead not of one’s city and not of one’s family. Across the expanse of the Eurasian landmass, from the Mediterranean to Han China, the cults of ancestors were meticulously observed and venerated for reasons not altogether dissimilar to those reasons underlying the cult of saints. As cited below, Cicero weighs in on the issue of the sacred dead and observed that they were to be considered by tradition among the class of gods:
Collectively, the deceased were referred to as the manes, which we may translate as shades or spirits, and Cicero leaves us in no doubt that they were to be numbered among the gods. He makes the point twice in his essay On the Laws, first decreeing that "kinsmen who have died shall be considered gods" (Leg. 2.22), and later commenting that the nine days following immediately upon the funeral, when the house of the deceased was ritually purified, would not have been considered holidays "if our ancestors had not desired that those who have quit this life should be numbered among the gods" (Leg. 2.55).27 This belief is the source of the expression dis manibus — "to the divine spirits of the dead" — that may still be read on literally scores of thousands of Latin tombstones. This always appears in the plural, and it is only in the course of the first century B.C. that it is conjoined with the name of the individual or individuals whose remains have been interred. For this reason, it is generally accepted today that before this date the individual was not venerated as such by his descendants, but blended insensibly into the assemblage of earlier ancestors, who were tended collectively.28 This may well be the case; several other aspects of traditional Roman behavior that touch upon the cult of the dead also experienced convulsive change during the late Republic, a point to which we shall return later. For now, let it merely be observed that in the following three centuries this cult not only persisted but actually grew steadily more elaborate. 11
However, all of the points made by this reviewer are, against the grand scheme of the book and the evidences and arguments supplied, really a small array of equally small adjustments to an expertly crafted and thoroughly enjoyable book. Dr. Brown’s The Cult of the Saints has stood the test of some thirty years in print and has set a benchmark for the discipline under study that profits greatly from a rigorous and secular approach that rises to the seriousness of the cultural and historical questions discussed. Dr. Brown knew well when he combined these elements of what had been lectures into the binding of a short book that he had only broken the surface of this deep and unexplored topic. He left the subject of the holy dead resting expectantly for further works that would explore the subject for which The Cult of the Saints serves as both a beacon and a beckoning.

Mani and Authorship of the Canonical Gospels
By John, on June 18th, 2011
Manichaean priests: Manuscript from Khocho, Tarim Basin
We have been in error, accepting the view of biblical scholarship and Christian tradition which dates the canonical gospels to the early period of the Roman Empire.
This error is personally mortifying, for I recognised and declared long ago the danger inherent in this approach. This is the sort of nonsense we accepted:
Even within the period that runs from c. A.D. 100-300 it is possible for paleographers to be more specific on the relative date of the papyrus manuscripts of the New Testament. For about sixty years now a tiny papyrus fragment of the Gospel of John has been the oldest “manuscript” of the New Testament. This manuscript (P52) has generally been dated to ca. A.D. 125. This fact alone proved that the original Gospel of John was written earlier, viz. in the first century A.D., as had always been upheld by conservative scholars. (Dating the Oldest New Testament Manuscripts by Peter van Minnen)
Use of the terms “fact” and “proved” is wrong. The early fragments of the New Testament do not have a secure, archaeological context and none have been radiocarbon-dated, relying instead on paleography. Here is better thinking:
What emerges from this survey is nothing surprising to papyrologists: paleography is not the most effective method for dating texts, particularly those written in a literary hand. Roberts himself noted this point in his edition of P52. The real problem is the way scholars of the New Testament have used and abused papyrological evidence. I have not radically revised Roberts¶s work . I have not provided any third-century documentary papyri that are absolute “dead ringers” for the handwriting of P52, and even had I done so, that would not force us to date P52 at some exact point in the third century. Paleographic evidence does not work that way. What I have done is to show that any serious consideration of the window of possible dates for P52 must include dates in the later second and early third centuries. Thus, P52 cannot be used as evidence to silence other debates about the existence (or non-existence) of the Gospel of John in the first half of the second century. Only a papyrus containing an explicit date or one found in a clear archaeological stratigraphic context could do the work scholars want P52 to do. As it stands now, the papyrological evidence should tak e a second place to other forms of evidence in addressing debates about the dating of the Fourth Gospel. (“The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel” by Brent Nongbri, Harvard Theological Review 98:23-52, 2005.)
The non-canonical GoVpel of JXdaV has been radiocarbon dated to 280 CE +/- 60 years and I now declare that the canonical gospels in their near-final form likely belong to this period.
Here is how I reached this position:
In The vacuum of evidence for pre-4th century Christianity, I presented our findings from surveying the archaeology of this period: there is no clear, unambiguous use of the term μChrist¶ (including μChristian¶ and μChristianity¶) in any medium, before the fourth century. One must note that Christ is translated as Messiah, the annointed. In Archaeology of μChrest¶ I presented various artefacts that mention μChrest¶, μIsu Chrest¶ and μJesus Chrest¶. One must note that Chrest is translated as Good. With no archaeology – and this includes texts – for Christ or Christianity before the fourth century, there is no Christian Church: no offices and officers, including Popes; no churches; no iconography of Jesus Christ. The Good Shepherd motif is Panhellenistic,

Late Roman marble copy of the Kriophoros of Kalamis (Museo Barracco, Rome)
'Chrest' changed later to 'Christ' in the Codex Sinaiticus
Jesus Abermentho mosaic at Brading Villa. 4th century.
A canonical epistle by Mani, from a Coptic papyrus codex at Kellis, Egypt
specifically of HeUmeV KUiophoUoV. The warning for this Christian vacuity comes from Josephus, whose chronicles fail to describe even a nascent Christianity. He makes references to the Sadducees, Jewish High Priests of the time, Pharisees and Essenes, the Herodian Temple, Quirinius¶ census and the Zealots, and to such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, Agrippa I and Agrippa II. Regardless of the disputed reference to “Jesus, who was called Christ”, Josephus is an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism and the context of early Christianity, yet says nothing of it: this is so unlikely as to be almost impossible. When Hadrian invented the cult of his Antinous, he created masses of good archaeology for us to find: an entire city, temples, very many statues and even the obelisk describing how Antinous was made a god. Though Christianity claims to be empire-wide and with many adherents belonging to the Greco-Roman elite, it has nothing. That is another impossible position. We can prove that the first-century miracle worker Apollonius of Tyana existed, but not that anyone was Christian until the fourth century.
The Josephus texts contain two other, important warnings: testimonia (claims for texts which are not extant) and forgery.
An argument used to support the claim that Josephus mentions Jesus Christ is that this was then mentioned by Origen, but the fact is we do not have any original text by Origen and no contemporaneous evidence for either Origen, or works attributed to him.
We do not have any original text by Josephus either, for the oldest are medieval. Even if he did write of Jesus, we do not know if he wrote Christ or Chrest.
The Aramaic Josephus is missing. That is another warning.
As well as the danger of relying on texts which do not exist, there is the massive problem of known texts which have been μlost¶ (such as the declarations of loyalty to Diocletian from every town and city in the empire) and the enormous quantity of texts which Christian scholars and the Christian Church admit to being forgeries. Between the destruction of important texts and inscriptions, and the admitted dishonesty for Christian texts, a scholar is faced with the unedifying task of investigating a religion which, down to its roots, is riddled with lies and fakery.
Judaic religious texts are renowned for their integrity and as Christianity likes to claim a Judaic heritage, Christians may imagine that their own texts have the same integrity, but this is demonstrably untrue. One of the two oldest codices of the New Testament is Sinaiticus, which contains some 20,000 alterations, to become one of the most altered texts in existence. We found also how Chrest was altered to read Christ (right).
The archaeology we have for Chrest and Jesus Chrest is for a figure of Greek magic, a Jesus Aberamentho with the head of a cockerel. The Jesus Chrest in the earliest gospels is a fullyformed man, more in the traditon of Apollonius of Tyana than a deity to be commanded to perform an exorcism. He is not first or second century, but from the third at the earliest and probably the fourth. That brings us back to the one gospel which is dated reliably: 280 +/- 60 years.
From whence does the canonical Jesus Chrest derive? That is an easy answer, now we have the period, for there is but one source: from the East, the Jesus Chrestos of Mani (ca 216-276 CE).
I hope and expect that we will be able, by looking within the Parthian Empire, to come to understand the Parthian Jesus Chrest. The magical bowl inscribed with Chrest Magus was made in Syria during the last years of the past era, and both Thrace and Parthia have various historical characters taking the title μServant of Jesus¶ in both the past era and the first century of the modern.
We will look further, at a future time, at how the Church of Mani became the Christian Church, but in short, it had to have been merged with the Religio Romana, adopting many of its offices and adapting its rituals. I will argue that a likely medium to bring this Jesus Chrest to Rome was one of Mani¶s converts, Zenobia, who saw the story by Josephus (taken from royal archives) for an angel visiting Monobaz while his sister/wife Helen was pregnant with Izates (Angel), as part of her own heritage.
The lack of archaeology for Christ and Christianity, in contrast with the reliable archaeology for the Jesus Chrest of Mani, then his conversion of Zenobia, forces us to look to Aurelian and his principle of “one god, one empire”, which was later adopted to a full extent by Constantine I.
This is a short period, with only a small number of principal characters, including Constantius I and Helen, the forger of Christian archaeology on a grand scale.

We will have to cast a critical eye at μEusebius¶ – of Nicomedia and of CaeVaUea – and the claims by the latter for Origen (“child of Horus”), who, whatever he was, was not a Christian.
Professor McGuckin replied to my inquiry on archaeology to support the historicity for Origen by referring me to his The WeVWminVWeU handbook Wo OUigen, though to my mind, this tome exposes the weakness of his case, for rather than using extant sources contemporaneous to Origen, he relies on later, unsubstantiated claims. Such is the nature of the μglittering web¶.
We should not accept the historicity of characters who leave no footprint upon the world, most especially when they are said to move in exalted and literate circles, and author important books (which do not exist). When temptation overcomes caution, then reference to these books should never assume authority, for it is important to know what is known and what is not.
Christian tradition exists precisely because it is not history; to pretend otherwise is both foolish and dishonest.
There is much to do and much to undo.

Dear Antony: your kind comment adds a sparkle to the summer sunshine - thank you.
My colleague here is looking at spatial relations within archaeological sites, particularly where Bronze Age (solar) monuments are
remodeled and reused in the Hellenistic and then Greco-Roman periods. Something interesting seems to be going on, carrying
on into the medieval period and Christian activity.
I want to trace back, if possible, the roots of Mani's Jesus Chrest, to see if this draws at all on Mithradates Chrestus and the
subsequent Mithridatic Wars.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M...
I find it implausible that the 'Servants of Jesus' in the last years of the past era and first century of the modern are unconnected
with the Elkasaites, who lead eventually to Mani.

This could take them back to the 1st century:"...a certain person belonging to Scythia, hearing the name Scythianus and living in
the time of the apostles, was the founder and leader of this sect..." (The Disputation with Manes, The Remains of Archaelaus
Bishop of Cascar, in Mesopotamia, translated by S.D.F. Salmond)
Unlike many, I do not believe in an historical Jesus, for I can see numerous characters, deities and traditions used to weave the
gospel accounts, though I would like to know what these strands are. Some, like Horus, Hermes Kriophoros and Dionysus have
been obvious to many for a long time and others require more effort to identify.

Another well-done article, John. Whereas I don't believe in an historical Jesus I do leave room open for an historical *Yehoshua*
who was memorialized by Eviyonim and Netzarim, but whose identity got stolen by the Christians, who then, by blending his
identity with the life stories and sufferings of Aeschlaepius, Appolonius of Tyana, Krishna, Promotheus and even Julius Caesar,
among others, foisted a pious fraud upon the world.
And Justin Martyr spills the beans when he inadvertently reveals the Crucifix is based on the mounting of the wax image of a
deceased Emperor on a cruciform tropaeum at his funeral. (1 Apology 55) This was totally forgotten until Francesco Carotta
compared various histories of Julius Caesar's funeral and made the inescapable conclusion that the first "crucifix" was raised on
the 17th of March, 44 BCE.

Kind of you to say, Edward.
Was there an Alexander III of Macedon. Almost certainly yes, but who is the hero of the Alexander Romance and what exactly
was worshipped as a god in the modern era? Was there a Pythagoras? Perhaps, but the Pythagoras described in the modern era
as a divine man capable of flight, is something different. There was an Apollonius of Tyana in the first century but who is the
miracle worker described later as Apollonius of Tyana?
Asking is there was an historical Jesus Christ is a non sequitur and our studies here are trying to learn and explain what are such
divine men and how they came into existence.
If Jesus (Chrest or Christ) the divine man is 'normal', then he would be a cultic hero such as Alexander, Pythagoras and
Apollonius, resurrected later. The question of historicity would then be to determine which historical character had been

resurrected. He could be Jason of Greek mythology, or Jesus the High Priest written of by Josephus alongside his account of
how James was killed, or - and I think this more likely - an assemblage made in an Homeric mould. In this sense, I see him as
unique, not following the normal pattern for making divine men in this period. I therefore think you are on the right track, in seeing
him remade by Romans, to suit their imperial purpose.
I think too that we can now be sure that this assembly took place over time, in stages. Jesus the Good is not quite Jesus the
Messiah and even this Jesus the Good developed in stages, for I think that the 3rd-century Jesus Chrest of Mani is not the same
as that of Scythianus in the first century. This is what I am looking at right now.

Hello Simone and welcome to our site.
First, I must say how I like both your photography and archaeology blog very much. Google Chrome offers an instant translation
from the Italian, so reading your posts is quite easy for me.
The question of where 'Jesus Christ' originates is, I think, more difficult than a simple 'historical' or 'mythological'.
The term 'Christ' appears first very 'late'. I have not yet been able to ascertain when it is first used, though I would offer a guess
that it could be as late as the 5th century, maybe even the late 5th century.
The earliest texts use abbreviations, 'Chrest' and Greek regal terms such as Saviour and Lord; none seem to use 'Christ'.
As I mention in the above post, the only religion/Church I know to use a 'Jesus Chrest' before 300 CE is Manicheism.
That, in itself. does not, I think, make Jesus Christ mythological.
Now, moving on to a personal view of this. I have now seen enough archaeological fakery - for example changing 'Chrest' to
'Christ' in texts - and expropriation by the Christian Church of histories belonging to others (Jews, Manicheans, and members,
rituals and offices of the Religio Romana), to offer a view that this is not mythology, but fraud and not just of history, but also
today, in modern scholarship.
Best regards,
John

Thank you very much. Your site about history is very interesting, too.
But the phrase «The term 'Christ' appears first very 'late'.» is incorrect. The term not appears later, we says that appear later. A
very intelligent paradigm in archaeology is: "the absence of evidence is not an evidence of absence".This is the basic for all
archaeologists. All writing out of this paradigm is out of archaeology. Especially when discoursing on ancient writings.
Second: the term Savious and Lord are more common (today too), but the Gospels clearly use Christ (Messiah in Greek) for
designating Jesus (because the Apostles called him Messiah), and Gospels clearly wrote during first century: another, we don't
have the earliest copies of these Gospels, but does not mean that there not are.
More complex: dating back P52 to 96-125 AD is a right fact without doubt. Datation is 96-125 AD, not 125 AD as scholarship
common write. Are P52 clearly wrote during that period? NO. Are P52 probably wrote during that period? YES without doubt. The
paleography is a precise science, but not risolutive (in 1935 as today, but today better than 1935). Are stratigraphy in

archaeology the better method of datation as other? NO, especially in the Middle East and Egypt, because of the desert and
bedouins who lived in the caves.
Brent Nongbri wrote a very stupid thesis: "Only a papyrus containing an explicit date or one found in a clear archaeological
stratigraphic context could do the work scholars want P52 to do." is out of order by all methodology in archaeology. The abuse of
unknowing science. It's a non-sense, I dislike this: for ex. the 90% (or so on, in any case the most part) of latin inscription are
without date and without stratigraphy, but we use very commonly to reconstruct the ancient roman society and dating with
paleography (the sigma in chronology are more or less wide). Why only for Gospels we must pretend the signature of a notary?
We work for hypotheses, not with fact: I think that the Gospels of John wrote before 70 AD, I don't care of P52. In next year I
publish (probably on ZPE) a latin inscription uncovered out of dig, during the plowing, and dating it with paleography: not with a
sigma of 30 years, more probably with 50-60 years.
Another problem: are the ancient history of protochristianismus rebuilt today? NO in my honest opinion, because the modern
scholarship not are interesting in this, but only interesting to accredit or discredit the Church and personal ideology or faith. Only
a few scholas have written with wisdow, like Martin Hengel, among the greatest scholars of XX century.
In conclusion: every study which claims to base his argument and thesis only on fragment of history clearly knowed today are a
biggest fake. If you pretend to use the archaeology, you can formulate only hypotheses and think about what might exist but
which no longer exist. A difficult work, I know. :)

Hello Dr. Gianolio,
First allow me to welcome you to the discussion. We are always pleased when an archaeologist takes and interest in HHI and
its overall thesis.
That said, I think we should be very clear on a few points:
we are not bound in wedlock to any idea, agenda, or ideology related to the origins of Christianity (which appears to be the focus
of your comment). When you assert that the term Christ does not appear late (and by this I take it you argue Christos is a term
that may be found in canonical Gospel fragments or codices of the first and second centuries CE). I would be very much in your
debt if you couldsupply evidence of this lexeme¶s early use in juxtaposition with any Jesus anywhere. If you do this, we will
modify our position for this is how science operates: working hypothesis modified in the face of empirical evidence. Consider
this a warm and open invitation.
Second, we have treated Sinaiticus as an artifact in our discussions. Superposition, as you note, is a fundamental rule of
archaeology and Sinaiticus demonstrates very clear superposition of ink layers with respect to the writing of the lexeme
Christianand Chrestian. Chrestian was written earlier, erased, and a later layer of ink recorded Christian. We have placed several
such examples from Sinaiticus on HHI and you may check the online document yourself. In short, treating the text of Sinaiticus
as an artifact and applying the rule of superposition we arrive at the conclusion that in what is amongst the oldest canonical New
Testament artifact Chrest- was written earlier and replaced later with Christ-. This finding suggests serious response and
discussion from the academic community.
Paleography is not a scientific method for dating various hands, scripts, and therefore age of documents. Paleography is merely a
rubric of traditionally accepted guidelines. These guidelines are subject to complete reorientation once and when a canonical
vellum or papyrus is subjected to scientific methods of dating, C14 for instance. Luckily with Sinaiticus, we need not trouble
ourselves with paleography, for, as HHI has repeatedly pointed out, there is a clear superposition of hands and ink on the sheets
of the codex itself. HHI has recorded and reported this superposition of evidence and drawn a clear scientific (albeit simple)
conclusion. Chrest is earlier than Christ. This is archaeological method applied to a text approached as an artifact, not as a
sacred object. This is where the distinction needs to be emphasized.
Anyway, the Chrest/Christ superposition does not end with this single Sinaiticus artifact. HHI haspresented several others for
which archaeology has provided contexts that support what is found in the Sinaiticus artifact. The question is an important one in
understanding the development of our modern culture and the true contributions that culture in turn owes to Italy.
P52 as an artifact is in the form of a codex, not a papyrus. This suggest to an archaeologist that we are already well into the

second century with respect to date. Second, there is a lively debate clattering about the marble halls of academia whether it is
possible for P52 to predate the Egerton Gospels (also in codex form). An additional piece of what had once been part of the
Egerton Gospel fragments now in the British Museum was located in the fonds of the University of Cologne and made public in
1987 (Papyrus Köln 255). The exact science of paleography recorded the use of an apostrophe stroke in the P255 and this form
of punctuation did not regularly appear in Grk MSS before the third century CE. P255 fits exactly into a torn sheet of the Egerton
Gospel. As much as one wishes otherwise, it is regrettable that t there is nothing certain about the paleographic dates for
P52. Again, a little scientific method here could answer the question. I very much envy epigraphers that work withstone where
there are frequently better contexts for the finds. I am not certain when you draw analogues between paleography on papyrus
and parchment that they hold up when discussing stone, but that is another matter.
Finally Dr. Gianolio, you wrote this:
Another problem: are the ancient history of protochristianismus rebuilt today? NO in my honest opinion, because the modern
scholarship not are interesting in this, but only interesting to accredit or discredit the Church and personal ideology or faith. Only
a few scholas have written with wisdom, like Martin Hengel, among the greatest scholars of XX century.
HHI cares not at all with the reputation of the Catholic Church. We do care very much about getting the history and archaeology
of our civilization correct and we invite science to this Movable Feast. People not reading the site carefully are prone to
concluding there is an axe grinding when there is only the search for what happened. By way of aside, Christians have nothing
to fear from the past that archaeology brings to light. Although Christianity did not start out as our primary concern, and it will
never be our sole concern, that form of religion may find that in unlocking the mystery of its past, it will suffer less at the hands of
those who desire to discredit it.
The real problem is at least as old as Galileo: to what extent are we in the scholarly community willing to give ancient sources a
pass with respect to critical evidence tests that we do not afford other texts from other cultures? Are we allowing our own cultural
bias to fail us in discussion and analysis of our own history?
A thought from the Wiki:
Abraham Ortelius (Abraham Ortels) (April 14, 1527 – June 28, 1598) was a Flemish cartographer and geographer, generally
recognised as the creator of the first modern atlas, the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World). He is also believed to be
the first person to imagine that the continents were joined together before drifting to their present positions.
The theory was not accepted as scientific fact until the 20th century and Ortellus was making observations from evidence he
collated from logbooks while training in a map-making guild.
If you have any solid evidence in support of your position, HHI is waiting for it with scientific detachment. We will modify our
position as necessary, until then...
Very Best - David

Dear Dr. Gianolio,
Thank you for the freshingly-frank appraisal, in which you want the world to serve your institution, so that archaeology (in this
case paleography and P52) serves the Roman Church; I doubt, therefore, that we can enjoy a meaningful discussion on this
subject, for I need P52 to be whatever it is and for archaeology to learn what that is, regardless of anyone or anything else.
Best regards,
John
PS
The general readrer may be interested to know that P52 makes no reference to any Jesus/Chrest/Christ, or Lord, Saviour, etc,

I was away for about two months but I noted Dr Gianolio's comments with interests. One of his remarks is about how excellent a
scholar on protochristianity Dr Martin Hengel was. If his other works are anything like "Crucifixion in the Ancient World and the
Folly of the Message of the Cross" (originally "Mors Turpissima Crucis" released in Germany), I think I'll skip it. Because the
more I look into that tome the more I am convinced that Dr Hengel and his American translator made a hash of the whole subject,
regardless of motive! And all of scolarship seems to have followed his lead until Gunnar Samuelsson's recent study, "Crucifixion
in Antiquity" was let out in Sweden last year. I would rather trust known archaeological evidence, known etymology and known
definitions in the Lexica while keeping a keen eye that "crux" and "staruros" might not necessarily include "cross!"
That having said, I found a piece of evidence that touches on the subjects of both crucifixion and protochristianity. It is a graffito
found in the Tiberian Palace in Palatine Hill in Rome and consists of a series of lines above an apparent depiction of a stage set
up for a passion play which seems to have been produced for an Imperial audience. Judging by the lettering, I believe the
original epigraph was/is extremely old, from the First Century CE; I have seen similar writing styles in images of graffiti from
Pompeii. The image was published in the 1898 volume of Methodist Magazine and of course, the author, being Christian, draws
slightly incorrect conclusions. Feel free to add it to your Archaeology of the Chrest article.
Link:
http://books.google.com/books?...
Here are the lines as best as I can tell:
CRESTVS (Crestus)
VIRGIS ERAT COESUS SECRETIS MORIBUS (With twigs he was chewed up in secret manners)
SUPER PALUM A VIRUM FIXUM (On top of a pale - Alas! a man is fixed) [i.e., impaled. Nothing about nailing to a cross!]
NON REQVIES NON SOMNIS CLAVOIT OCELIOS (By no means a rest, by no means with [periods of] sleep,...) [I am unable to
decipher the rest]
PER CUNCTOS NOCTES ESTUET OMNIS AMOR (Through the nights the passion of everyone burns all) [or something like that]
EX OVO NOTITIAS VIROSO FUIT (From an egg he makes an acquaintance with a man) [To me, it doesn't make sense unless
it describes homosexual contact! Then "ovo" (egg) would be slang for scrotum or testicle.]
The rest of the text except for some of the slave stagehands' names, like PILETUS, is unintelligible or even illegible.
On Edit 9-28-2011: Despite the first two lines thereof apparently dealing with the subject of the process of crucifixion, those five
lines are all rude homosexual verse! And the image below the verse is the portrayal of preparations for an elaborate rope-damce
on two crosses (tropaea) and an overhead beam (patibulum?).

John: thank you for your interest and question.
You refer to the entry in Wikipedia, which I quote:
Of his Adversus Christianos (Against the Christians) in fifteen books, only fragments remain, as quotations adduced in
order to be refuted.[14][15] In it, he famously is quoted as having said, "The Gods have proclaimed Christ to have been
most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect." Counter-treatises were written by Eusebius of
Caesarea, Apollinaris of Laodicea, Methodius of Olympus, and Macarius of Magnesia, but all these are lost.Porphyry's
identification of the Book of Daniel as the work of a writer in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes (2nd century BC), is given
by Jerome. Augustine and the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian Socrates of Constantinople, assert that Porphyry was
once a Christian. [16]14 "Constantine and other emperors banned and burned Porphyry's work" (Digeser 1998:130).15
Letter of Constantine proscribing the works of Porphyry and Arius, To the Bishops and People, in Socrates Scholasticus,
Historia Ecclesiastica, i.9.30-31; Gelasius, Historia Ecclesiastica, II.36; translated in Stevenson, J., (Editor; Revised with
additional documents by W. H. C. Frend), A New Eusebius, Documents illustrating the history of the Church to AD 337
(SPCK, 1987).16 Historia Ecclesiastica III.23.
We therefore do not know, it seems to me, what Porphyry may have written on this - if anything at all. That said, I will
take this opportunity to mention these related views of mine:
a. What many regard as the history of the early Christian Church is based on little or nothing more than medieval texts
such as those referenced above.
b. Porphyry is, in my opinion, less a 'philosopher' and more a magician; this applies also to Iamblichus.
c. These two magicians provided, I think, much of the theurgy of whatever (Chrestian/Chrestic) Church was recognised, or
created by Constantine I, which later became the Christian Church.

Thank you for the response. I determined independently, through a communication with one of Porphyry's translators, that he only
exists in copy. What of Methodius, though? He was a contemporary of Origen, argued against some of his points and those of
Porphyry, and to my knowledge has an extant Greek text, The Symposium. Here is a link. http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/e...
I'm working on confirming this independently, but have many other things that consume my time. I'm also trying to find a Greek
'original' or facsimile to determine whether he has written Christ or Chrest, though that will definitely take some time.

Pliny correspondence with Trajan: Christians or
Chrestians?
By John, on May 25th, 2011
Trajan view ing the trophies of his soldiers (Trajan's Column). Trajan and Hadrian - his adopted son, according to Trajan's w ife - instigated the Second and Third Jew ish-Roman Wars.
One of the reasons given commonly to justify belief in a historical μJesus Christ¶ of the first century is that supposedly, there is contemporaneous, or at least μancient¶ evidence in support. This position has been undermined very considerably by our μCatalogue of Chrestμ. One of the few remaining textual sources left in support of an historical Jesus Christ – Christianity in the first centuries even – is the correspondence between Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus (62-c.115) – Pliny the Younger – and the Emperor Trajan, the claim for which we will now examine.
Our own studies, based on primary sources, first showed how there is much archaeology for a magical μJesus Chrest¶ – Jesus the Good – beginning to appear towards the end of the last century BCE.
We then examined the earliest codices of the New Testament, Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, where we found no mention of μChrist¶ at all.
Instead, we found μChrest¶, various Greek titles such as Soter, and abbreviations. None of these are specifically and unambiguously Christian. Rather, they belong to a Greek culture we have come to term Panhellenism – belief in a God other than the Hebrew.
My interpretation of this μGood¶ is μthe great and the good¶ – in the sense of power and authority, both secular and magical, for the name μJesus¶ is being used magically to command events.
Many of the characters who appear in Christian tradition are represented in the historical record, though not as Christian. We have begun to treat some of them, such as Saul “kinsman of Costobarus” in Josephus, the imperial chamberlain Epaphroditus, and elite Romans such as Clemens and Pudens; there are many more and we have come to regard them as μChrestian¶.
In the first century of this era, Chrestians are the elite, μthe great and the good¶ and not until the reign of Domitian, when Hadrian first takes public office, or perhaps a little later, with his Antinous, is Chrest associated with those outside the elite circles of imperial power.
The life of Pliny encompasses the reign of a number of emperors, including Domitian, and letters attributed to him have been published and republished very many times in the last 500 years or so. He is historical and few would doubt that the bulk of his correspondence

There is no 'Christ' in Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, the tw o oldest codices of the New Testament.
Piece of the marble slab that once adorned the public baths at Comum, inscribed w ith the distinctions of Pliny the Younger. Sant' Ambrogio church. (C.I.L. v. 5262)
is
genuine.
The tenth book consists of letters to and from the emperor Trajan, mostly written during Pliny¶s governorship. In these letters, he seeks rulings from Trajan on matters arising in his province.
This assumption has been made by scholars for centuries and is one of the few, apparently-effective arguments for the historicity of Christianity in the first two centuries. They could make an effective antidote to our study of chrestic archaeology.
Pliny, Letters 10.96-97
Pliny to the Emperor Trajan
It is my practice, my lord, to refer to you all matters concerning which I am in doubt. For who can better give guidance to my hesitation or inform my ignorance? I have never participated in trials of Christians. I therefore do not k now what offenses it is the practice to punish or investigate, and to what extent. And I have been not a little hesitant as to whether there should be any distinction on account of age or no difference between the very young and the more mature; whether pardon is to be granted for repentance, or, if a man has once been a Christian, it does him no good to have ceased to be one; whether the name itself, even without offenses, or only the offenses associated with the name are to be punished.
Meanwhile, in the case of those who were denounced to me as Christians, I have observed the following procedure: I interrogated these as to whether they were Christians; those who confessed I interrogated a second and a third time, threatening them with punishment; those who persisted I ordered executed. For I had no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, stubbornness and inflexible obstinacy surely deserve to be punished. There were others possessed of the same folly; but because they were Roman citizens, I signed an order for them to be transferred to Rome.
Soon accusations spread, as usually happens, because of the proceedings going on, and several incidents occurred. An anonymous document was published containing the names of many persons. Those who denied that they were or had been Christians, when they invok ed the gods in words dictated by me, offered prayer with incense and wine to your image, which I had ordered to be brought for this purpose together with statues of the gods, and moreover cursed Christ±none of which those who are really Christians, it is said, can be forced to do±these I thought should be discharged. Others named by the informer declared that they were Christians, but then denied it, asserting that they had been but had ceased to be, some three years before, others many years, some as much as twenty-five years. They all worshipped your image and the statues of the gods, and cursed Christ.
They asserted, however, that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind themselves by oath, not to some crime, but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not falsify their trust, nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so. When this was over, it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partak e of food±but ordinary and innocent food. Even this, they affirmed, they had ceased to do after my edict by which, in accordance with your instructions, I had forbidden political associations. Accordingly, I judged it all the more necessary to find out what the truth was by torturing two female slaves who were called deaconesses. But I discovered nothing else but depraved, excessive superstition.
I therefore postponed the investigation and hastened to consult you. For the matter seemed to me to warrant consulting you, especially because of the number involved. For many persons of every age, every rank , and also of both sexes are and will be endangered. For the contagion of this superstition has spread not only to the cities but also to the villages and farms. But it seems possible to check and cure it. It is certainly quite clear that the temples, which had been almost deserted, have begun to be frequented, that the established religious rites, long neglected, are being resumed, and that from everywhere sacrificial animals are coming, for which until now very few purchasers could be found. Hence it is easy to imagine what a multitude of people can be reformed if an opportunity for repentance is afforded.

'Chrest' changed later to 'Christ' in the Codex Sinaiticus.
possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a k ind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it±that is, by worshiping our gods±even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous k ind of precedent and out of k eeping with the spirit of our age.
The question arises, from our point of view: what is the primary source of this published correspondence? That is, are they based on the letters themselves? The short answer is μno¶, they are not based on his letters.
This translation is based on the text of the letters edited by R. A. B. Mynors (Oxford, 1963), which is faithfully reproduced in the Loeb edition (ed. B. Radice, 1969). It rests on three separate manuscript traditions, which Mynors labels alpha, beta, gamma, and which are popularly known as the Nine-book, Ten-book, and Eight-book versions. The Nine-book tradition is represented by two ninth-century manuscripts M and V, and V does not survive after V 6, leaving M as the sole representative of this tradition for V 7 to IX. The Ten-book tradition (beta) provides the sole evidence for Book X; no manuscript survives after V 6, so that we are dependent on printed editions for the rest. The Eightbook version (so called because it does not contain Book VIII) has no complete surviving manuscript, and provides the least reliable readings of the three. Mynors helpfully prefaces his edition with a book-by-book survey of the available evidence from the three traditions. The section numbers of Mynors¶ text are given in the margins. The existence of the letters as we have them is attributable to the heroic endeavours of the Italian and French humanists. They assembled them from widely dispersed texts of the three traditions. There is an enlightening brief account by Reynolds in L. D. Reynolds (ed.), Texts and Transmission (Oxford, 1983), 316-22. (Pliny the Younger, Complete Letters, A new translation by P.G. Walsh, OUP Oxford 2009)
From an earlier, classic collection:
Sources of the Text For the first nine Books, we have three distinct sources, viz. (a) MSS. containing Books I.-V., of which the best are R (Florentinus Ashburnhamensis R. 98 olim Riccardianus), tenth century, F (Laurentianus S. Marci 284), tenth-eleventh century; (6) MSS. containing Books I. -VII. and IX., all of the fifteenth century, of which D (Dresdensis D. 166) is representative; (c) MSS. containing nine books, of which the best is M (Laurentianus 47. 36). V (Vaticanus 3864) is closely akin to M, but contains only Books I.-IV. The text of Book X. depends on a lost MS. which contained also the first nine Books. While this was still extant at Paris, copies of it by different hands were used by Avantius of Verona for his edition of 1502, and by Aldus in 1508. But while the Aldine edition gave the tenth Book entire, the first forty Letters are for some reason missing in that of Avantius. A MS. of these Letters has been discovered by Hardy in the Bodleian Library, which appears to be the actual copy from which Aldus printed.
In France Giovanni Giocondo (c. 1433 – 1515) a Dominican priest, claimed to have discovered a manuscript of Pliny the Younger¶s letters containing copies of his correspondence with Trajan. Two Italian editions of Pliny¶s Epistles were published by Giocondo, one printed in Bologna in 1498 and one from the press of Aldus Manutius in 1508.
The earliest letters are medieval and we do not know what exactly Pliny may have written – Chrest or Christ.
Such is the case for all texts claimed in support for early Christianity: they either use Chrest, an abbreviation, or they do not exist – and belong to a Christian textual tradition, rather than history. By understanding their context, we may learn something useful.
If we are to find any value in the Testimonia, the many texts for which no primary source material exists, such as Pliny and Justin amongst others, it is by studying them within their archaeological context.
The term used in the artefactual evidences of the early centuries is Chrest/Good – not messiah – and Jesus the Good, and that is the context within which the missing primary source material should be interpreted.
If the Pliny-Trajan correspondence is genuine, then we may consider the term used was not Christian, but Chrestian. This method of interpretation applies also to the earliest codices of the New Testament.

And that's just the thing: we HAVE to interpret the literary evidence in light of the archaeological evidence, because the Christians
seem to have conveniently "lost" the original writings!
I did this sort of thing with the subject of crucifixion and it turns out the ancients were talking about, as far as the Roman
methodology was concerned, a method of compulsory self-impalement! A most wicked, cruel, shameful and disgusting form of
execution.
And there's the issue of forgeries! For example, contrary to the scholarly consensus, I am firmly convinced that Josephus'
Antiquities 18.3.3 and the Jamesian passage in 20.9.2 are forgeries, likely committed by Eusebius. What else did they forge???

In describing how statues were made and used in the first centuries of this era, we have been using terms such as resurrection, Greek magic and ritual, and related them to the Antinous cult of Hadrian and the concept of the messiah.
Pygmalion and Galatea, oil on canvas by François Boucher (1703 – 1770)
In Book X of the MHWDPRUSKRVHV by OYLG (43 BCE – 17 or 18 CE), P\JPDOLRQ is the king of Cyprus who carved a woman out of ivory, fell in love with its beauty and through a kiss, brought the statue to life. This basic plot has been reworked in various media down through the ages and as a Transformational myth, may be compared to both HDGULDQ DQG AQWLQRXV, and to the HDGULDQLF FUHDWLRQ of JHVXV CKULVW.
LefW: Bust of Antinous From Patras, (National Archaeological Museum of Athens). In October 130,
according to Hadrian, cited by Dio Cassius 1, "Antinous was drowned in the Nilus" – on the day and in the place Egyptians believed Osiris was drowned (before being resurrected).
On the third day, Hadrian recovered the body of his catamite and as PRQWLIUH[ MD[LPXV (high priest of the College of Pontiffs), made a blessing and declared him to be divine.
In Ovid's story, Pygmalion is a sculptor who is not interested in women. He kissed his ivory statue and thought the kisses were returned. He talked to it with words of love, and brought to it the kind of gifts that are thought would please, such as shells and pebbles, little birds, and flowers of all colours. Besides all this, he also draped it with robes, put rings upon its fingers, and a necklace around her neck. By night, Pygmalion put the statue on a bed, called it the consort of his bed, and rested its head upon soft pillows.
He k noZV 'WiV madneVV, \eW he mXVW adoUe, And VWill Whe moUe he k noZV iW, loYeV Whe moUe: The fleVh, oU ZhaW Vo VeemV, he WoXcheV ofW, Which feelV Vo VmooWh, WhaW he belieYeV iW VofW.
Pygmalion and Hadrian both find women sexually loathsome, but love their own, divine creations.
We at History Hunters International are studying the divine men of Classical Antiquity, from Buddha and Khrshna to Alexander the god, Apollonius of Tyana and Pythagoras, to Jesus Christ. Though some of them may have an historiographical existence in earlier times, in the late-first and early-second centuries of this era and especially in the Alexandrian cities of the panhellenic world, these figures of ancient cultural heritage were resurrected in divine form.
Statues were made and through the appeal of PDJLF ULWXDO, divine intervention was sought to resurrect the dead. In the minds of those

ZL]DUGV, or the beholders of such statues, at least, these statues now contained the DQLPXV of the dead – and were now divine in themselves.
The Argonauts Castor and Pollux capture Talos, the bronze giant who guarded the island of Crete. Red-figured vase, 5th cent. BCE from Apulia (Museo Jatta in Ruvo di Puglia)
The story of the breath of life in a statue has parallels in the examples of Daedalus, who used quicksilver to install a voice in his statues; of Hephaestus, who created automata for his workshop; of Talos, an artificial man of bronze; and, according to Hesiod, Pandora, who was made from clay at the behest of Zeus.
The discovery of the AQWLN\WKHUD PHFKDQLVP suggests that such rumoured animated statues had some grounding in contemporary mechanical technology. The island of Rhodes was particularly known for its displays of mechanical engineering and automata – Pindar, one of the nine lyric poets of ancient Greece, said this of Rhodes in his seventh Olympic Ode:

Priests of Anubis, The guide of the dead and the god of tombs and embalming, perform the "Opening of the Mouth" ritual
The OSHQLQJ RI WKH PRXWK ULWXDO was an ancient Egyptian ritual described in funerary texts such as the Pyramid Texts. The ritual involved the symbolic animation of a statue or mummy by magically opening its mouth so that it could breathe and speak. There is evidence of this ritual from the Old Kingdom to the Roman Period.
Ancient Egyptians believed that ritual existed which would bring sensory life back to the deceased¶s form, enabling it to see, smell, breathe, hear, and eat, and thus partake of the offering foods and drinks brought to the tomb each day. Priests would recite hymns such as this one, for Pa-nefer:
AZak e!..Ma\ \oX be aleUW aV a liYing one, UejXYenaWed eYeU\ da\, healWh\ in millionV of occaVionV of god Vleep, Zhile Whe godV pUoWecW \oX, pUoWecWion being aUoXnd \oX eYeU\ da\.
Temple of Dendur commissioned by Emperor Augustus and built by the Roman governor of Egypt, Petronius, around 15 BCE. Dedicated to Isis, Osiris, as well as two deified sons of a local Nubian chieftain, Pediese ("he whom Isis has given") and Pihor ("he who
belongs to Horus"). 2
Under Augustus, “deification by drowning” had provided the rationale for the native hero cults at the temple of DHQGXU, but Hadrian¶s Egyptianising cult of Antinous was extended throughout the empire. The receipt by Antinous of traditional rituals (“opening the mouth")
was recorded in hieroglyphs on the last commissioned obelisk, thereafter erected in Rome 3.

I hope this is of interest.
The purpose of the Ritual of Opening the Mouth was to ensure that life would re-enter into a deceased person so that he gained
life in the Hereafter.
Man-made statues, temple buldings and deceased persons could, by Egyptian thought, be imbued with life anew. But though the
ritual was performed preferrably by the king, a sem-preist or another deputy priest, it was the Creator god himself who made it
possible for this to happen. It was him who had:
"made the images that are on earth, by means of instruments he himself made".
"Thus the gods entered the bodies made of wood, minerals, clay and all the other things that grow and in which they took form."
1. Purification by the 'Lords of Purification'.
2. A priest impersonates the god Ptah, another one the god Sokar. Ptah takes his chisel to open the mouth of the statue and
Sokar opens the eyes.
3. A priest presents a wavy wand with a ram ́s head on top. (this is called 'Taking the Sorcerer' [wr-kh3w], we don ́t know what
was done more).
4. Next the priest was 'Presenting the Finger of Gold'.
5. Then the 'Adze of Yinepu' was presented to the statue.
6. The head officiant [s3-mry-f], son-whom-he loves, now 'opens' the eyes with this adze, and touches the mouth with four small
stones [`bwt]with the words: "I perform the Opening of the Mouth upon this your mouth so that

you may speak in the Afterlife".
The adze was made from meteoric iron found in the desert, and made especially for ritual purposes.
7-9. Slaughtering of animals (oxen, gazelles, goose). These sacrifices were probably symbolical and had probably been made in
advance, as no killing was usually allowed in front of a deity, lest he should take offense. It was also a matter of practicality, to
have the offerings of various kinds ready to arrange on the offering table and be presented.
10. The great oblation of bread, beer and meat was presented.
11. Opening the Mouth of Throne-of-the-Protector-of-his-Father. (This probably adhered to the officiants now going round to the
other parts of the temple)
12. All halls and rooms, with reliefs were now undergoing the same ritual: Censing its cult-chambers and purifying its chapels.
13. Sokar feeds the priesthood from the oblation, 'gladdening their hearts with their largess'. At a Consecration Ceremoy, this was
a great meal from the offerings in which not only the priesthood and officiants partook but also craftsmen and workers who had
been active in building the temple.
14. Ceding Wetjset-Hor to His Majesty. When the meal was over, the temple building was ready to be 'Handed over to its Lord' by
which means by the King himself. It could now function to celebrate services and festivals in.
This next part is particular relevance to Hadrian, with his project manager of Aeila Capitolina, Aquila, who is also supposed to
have made the translation into Greek - Septuagint - of the Hebrew Bible.

the western sky, where Pharaoh was reborn: Nut, the king's mother, gave birth to him in the Occident. Pharaoh was seen in the

through the liquid fields, where he encountered the Celestial Serpent Draco, whose head was the Judgment Hall of Osiris. In this
hall Pharaoh' heart would be weighed against Maat's feather. Would he survive and become a god? Would he be true of voice?
Would his heart be light, or heavy with sin? Would he be devoured by the crocodile Amemait, his soul and shadow burnt by the
snake Aaruthankut? Fortunately the king could rely on the help of Tefnut. She was his purifying fire; she guided him across the
sky and protected his heart (Wega) against the heavenly snake (Draco); and if the king were still attacked by the snake, she
could save him by wielding Aquila, which follows Cygnus. In the constellation of Aquila was seen the magic device used for the
ritual opening of the mouth. According to a modern physician, this mysterious device, a small adze, was actually used by
Egyptian doctors to force open the tracheas of scorpion sting or snakebite victims: and if the king were attacked by the Celestial
Serpent, Tefnut would employ it to save his life.

The post ended "The receipt by Antinous of traditional rituals (“opening the mouth") was recorded in hieroglyphs on the last

used for the ritual opening of the mouth."
The ritual sacrifice by Hadrian of Antinous must be viewed in the context of Greek magic, as practised in Egypt in this period and
this included Ptolemaic astrology.
To that I would like to add this:
AQFLHQW EJ\SWLDQ RLWXDO WRUVKLS by Wim van den Dungen
It seems unlikely for a processional & ritual construction as the Osireon, not to have been used for a netherworldy Osirian
mystery drama. As no other evidence of the sort of papyrus Leiden 32 T has (yet) been found, no final conclusions are at hand.
But even if these Egyptian initiation rituals were historical, they would differ from the Greek mysteries and should neither be
confused with Hermetic and other cross-cultural syncretisms (like the cult of Serapis). In these, native Egyptian thought was
Hellenized and modified to satisfy the Greek "noetic"mentalities (just as the Torah was Hellenized).
Under the Ptolemies, the original, native context had been lost for over eight centuries (namely at the beginning of the Third
Intermediate Period, ca. 1075 BCE), although the cultural pattern and its sacral core continued to remain operation long after
Pharaonic Egypt -in Greek guise- had finally come to an end with the suicide of Queen Cleopatra VII (30 BCE).
the Hellenistic reconstruction : Ancient Egyptian religion, after having influenced the Greeks, was eventually Hellenized. The cults
of Osiris and Isis, as well as Hermetism, evidence the survival of Hellenized forms of the native Egyptian ways. But the Greeks
intermixed their somber views of the hereafter with the extended Egyptian funerary rituals. Their extatic, "away from the body"
mystery traditions was escapist. The role of Anubis as "guide of the dead" and initiator and Osiris as "king of the dead" was
reinterpreted in terms of the Greek religious attitude.
...the Egyptian view on their mysteries and secrets was Oriental. The Egyptians loved life and saw death as the gate to an even
more richer life. After purification in the Netherworld, the final transformation of the soul takes place, initiating the spirit-state. The
rituals guaranteed a two-way communication between the spirit-world and the material plane : the false door in the tomb is a way
to leave the tomb but also a way to return to it. In the spiritual economy of the Old Kingdom funerary temples, this return of the
spirit to the tomb was crucial. Thanks to the funerary magic of the tomb, the deceased could make his family benefit from his (or
her) invisible powers and liberty of movement, free of shadow and extremely fast. In this way, magic could be accumulated and
passed on to future generations...
In the Graeco-Roman mind, nobody returned to Earth, the escape was final. Death brought rupture and disconnection. When, for
literary reasons or to close a play with a "deus ex machina", a spectre of the dead or a deity appeared, then surely only vaguely
and mostly to announce something bad or worse.

between the resurrection of divine men and the sprouting of seeds.
While much of the fourth century debates on the Christian Eucharist centered on the issue of leavened vs. unleavened wheat
bread offerings and therefore possessed an essential Judaic theological frame of argument, there exists a second century and
largely panhellenic-Egyptian aspect of wheat, water, and wine offerings associated with the sacrificed and resurrected Osiris.
From a liturgical point of view, it is a very short step from performing rites involving sacred wheat, water, and wine before the

comparisons between Christ and Osiris are now ubiquitous within the digital historiography of the internet; however, the actual
relationships between ritual, magic, liturgy, and image, where they may be demonstrated to exist, receive insufficient attention.
Liturgies within cults in both ancient Egyptian religion and emergent Christianity centered around rituals utilizing water, wine,
wheat, and bread.
1 CoUinWhianV: 35-49:
But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? Or with what manner of body shall they come? 36 Senseless man, that
which you sow is not quickened, except it die first. 37 And that which you sow, you sow not the body that shall be: but bare
grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest. 38 But God gives it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body. 39 All flesh is
not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, other of birds, another of fishes. 40 And there are bodies
celestial and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial. 41 One is the glory of the sun,
another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differs from star in glory. 42 So also is the resurrection
of the dead. It is sown in corruption: it shall rise in incorruption. 43 It is sown in dishonour: it shall rise in glory. It is sown in
weakness: it shall rise in power. 44 It is sown a natural body: it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also
a spiritual body, as it is written: 45 The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit. 46 Yet
that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterwards that which is spiritual. 47 The first man was of the earth,
earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly. 48 Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the
heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly. 49 Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the
image of the heavenly.
These texts of the late first and early second century depend in their resurrection imagery on Pauline metaphors of
seeds and first fruits. But they do not mean at all what Paul means. By and large these images stress not the
change from corruption to incorruption, or the difference between natural and spiritual, between the dry, the dead
seed and flowering sheaf; rather, they make the world to come a grander and more abundant version of this world.
Expressing enormous optimism about the goodness of creation, they draw such a close analogy between
resurrection and natural change that they either make resurrection a process set in motion by the very nature of
things, or they make all growth dependent on divine action. (Souce:CaUoline B\nXm, The ReVXUUecWion of Whe bod\

(Columbia University Press, 1995), she comes as close as she ever has to discussing elements of ancient religious belief related
to the doctrine of resurrection during the period we at HHI are exploring during our present series of posts.
In The ReVXUUecWion of Whe bod\ in WeVWeUn ChUiVWianiW\, Bynum cites 1 CoUinWhianV 15: 35-49. Without contesting Bynum¶s
views of the dates of the first century texts (this is open to serious question), her overall point concerning the second century is
important: the shift in the doctrine of resurrection represents a shift within the power structure backing emerging Christianity.
It is noteworthy that this shift appears to occur at the end of the second and beginning of the third century CE. P46, about which
we wrote in brief detail in The Gospels According to Hadrian, Part III: The Aelian Canon and the Main Hand of God contains
our earliest canonical physical artifact attesting to 1 CoUinWhianV and this second century view of the material resurrection of the
body after death.
That the author of 1 CoUinWhianV also relates this resurrection to a, shall we say, sliding scale of heavenly bodies, some of which
are named, links this text to second century astrology and suggests that part and parcel to determining ones level of immortality
depended to a certain extent on the nature of one¶s personal relationship to the stars and how Christ interceded to make this

celestial relationship more effective.
Careful study of the images used in major treatises on the resurrection from the years around 200 reveals that the seed metaphor
continues but in a sense almost antithetical to Paul¶s. It often now expresses a rather crude material continuity. Such
continuity, sometimes understood as the continuity of particles or atoms, is both a defense against and an articulation of the
threat of decay, which is understood as absorption or digestion. (p. 27)

The science and stagecraft of feeding condemned criminals and enemies of the state to wild beasts was well-developed by the
second century CE.
One of the most detailed and graphic illustrations of this practice may be found in the ZLOWHQ MRVDLF (lefW). For those condemned
who were deemed worthy of a quick death, exposure to a large carnivore was considered a humane means of dispatch. For WKH
FRQGHPQHG ZRUWK\ RI SDUWLFXODUO\ KHLQRXV FULPHV, exposure to smaller beasts was the sentence and elaborate delivery
mechanisms existed to place the victim before the animals and, with an eye toward showmanship, keep the condemned in the
center of the arena where the execution could be seen by all. The Zilten mosaic dated to circa 200 CE, was found not far from
Leptus Magna, birthplace of the emperor Septimus Severus.
MDUW\UGRP RI CKULVWLDQV LQ WKH DUHQD, particularly the act of dismemberment and ingestion by wild beasts, as Bynum calls
attention to later in this same passage quoted above when discussing the martyrdom of St. Ignatius of Antioch, is not a simple
act of cruelty, but part of the public and symbolic theological dialogue amongst the hostile factions contending for political,
economic, and religious authority in the empire. The martyrdom by beasts in the arena thus worked on a variety of levels: for the
masses enjoying the blood spectacle, this was perhaps merely entertainment; however, we should not be too quick to dismiss
the blood symbolism inherent in the ritual of the arena itself.
For educated panhellenes of the elite classes, particularly those who held proto-Rabbinical and pre-Christian views of bodily
resurrection, the practice of Imperial authorities of ritually feeding members of a sect espousing bodily resurrection to wild beasts
who would leave little left to resurrect, was both an answer, a challenge, and an insult on supremely theological grounds. This
was a world very different from our own and martyrdom by wild beast in the areas of the empire represented a kind of religious and
scientific experimental proof. It¶s clear object was to undermine the proto-Rabbinic and early Christian doctrines of resurrection.
As Bynum notes throughout the course of her work on Resurrection, there is an observable dividing line between the second and
third centuries within Christian treatises on the doctrine of resurrection: in the second century resurrection is more material in
aspect; after the second century, resurrection is fundamentally spiritual in doctrine. Bynum goes one to present: [b]y the later
part of the second century, the concerns Ignatius expresses here: [resurrection though his body is disarticulated and digested by
beasts] are couched in much more crudely literal language.
Two of the earliest second century treatises on resurrection – Justin Martyr¶s and Athenagoras¶s – have been
labeled apocryphal by some scholars partly because of the presence in them of certain technical scientific
arguments (such as the chain consumption argument) that concentrate on material continuity and are sometimes
thought [by scholars] to be later. I accept these treatises, both because they are accepted in some recent
scholarly considerations and because many study of metaphors establishes that the technical arguments at stake
are compatible precisely in their materialism with contemporary treatises known to be authentic. With the
exception of some fragments recently attributed to one “Josipos” and the Epistle to Rheginos (both of which see
resurrection as largely spiritual), the major discussions of the resurrected body from the second half of the second
century use predominantly organic metaphors but express through them material continuity. (The ReVXUUecWion of
Whe bod\ in WeVWeUn ChUiVWianiW\, 200-1336, (Columbia University Press, 1995) pp.28-29).

Christianity has its own metaphors expressing immortality through the imagery of living stones. This idea is rooted in the idea of
a holy city and this theological concept is alien to neither Panhellenism nor Judaism.
By the early fourth century, in the writings of Augustine of Hippo, the church edifice itself is associated with the living stones of a
celestial Jerusalem or heavenly kingdom. Augustine, Sermon 66, part of the Mass of Dedication for new churches since 10th
century: Then I Va\, aW Whe end of Whe ZoUld Vhall Whe VWoneV be joined Wo Whe foXndaWion, liYing VWoneV, hol\ VWoneV, WhaW aW Whe
end Whe Zhole edifice ma\ be bXilW b\ WhaW ChXUch, \ea b\ WhiV YeU\ ChXUch Zhich noZ VingV Whe neZ Vong, Zhile Whe hoXVe iV in
bXilding.
There are numerous hymns based on the link of a church edifice¶s stones with the living stones of transcendent spiritual church.
One such hymn from the 7th century CE based on Augustinian theology is composed thus:
Blessed City of Heavenly Salem/Vision Dear of Peace and Love/Who of living stones upbuilded/Art the joy of Heaven above/And,
with angel cohorts circled/As a bride to earth doth move./From celesital realms descending/Bridal glory round her shed/By her
Lord shall she be led:/All her streets, and all her bulwarks,/of pure gold fashioned./Bright with pearls her portals glitter,/They are
open evermore/And by virtue of his merits/Thither faithful souls may soar,/Who for Christ's dear name in this world/Pain and
tribulations bore. (Source: UUbV BeaWa JeUXValem, ScUipWXUal and PaWiVWic SoXUceV, EphemeUideV LiWXUgicae 70 (1956), pp. 238-41)
While professor Bynum's work focuses in the main on the medieval period, her scholarship touches on points where the history
and artifacts of ancient religion quite literally come alive. Here is a link to a long but very interesting discussion on, among other
topics, the miracle host of Wilsnak as well as the miracles performed by medieval Christian statues and icons. We would do well
to consider just how far back such forms of religious expressions extend in time into the pre-orthodox Christian traditions of the
ancient world.

Lancelotto, Members and Guests:
The 'living stones' theology of Christianity seems to be based on the same Greek magic used to 'animate' panhellenic statues, of
which those made by order of Hadrian for the resurrected Antinous are an example.
Christian liturgy must, perforce, also be based on magical ritual.
The statues of Buddha and other divine men of the panhellenic world - Antinous being an obvious example - seem to share a
theological basis with the consecration of Christian churches.
The archaeology of 'living stones' has much to tell us.

Is there are any difference between them? Theologians say yes, that in religion (usually WheiUV), their god works through the
magician (priest, supplicant, etc.). Theological power comes from their god, not the magician/priest. There is a post on Evidence
(and wh\ it's important) which addresses such terminology and the supernatural. Empirical knowledge of the supernatural does
not exist and therefore there is no language with which to describe it.
A religious ritual is the same as a magical ritual. A prayer is the same as a magical spell. Any supposed difference is imaginary
differences are cultural and have no basis in science (archaeology and historiography). That is, whatever differences may exist
are only in the heads of those who believe in them.
Of course later religions are drawn on earlier. Of course Greek magic is the basis of Coptic Christianity. Of course Lancelotto is
correct when he describes how the religion created by Hadrian is the father of the children, Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity.
There has long been much archaeology to describe this and the sole problem is in recognising it. People's heads are full of the
stuff and nonsense placed there by parents, priests and not-very-good teachers: old wives' tales.

The theology of 'Living Stones' is just sophiscated animism: a philosophical, religious or spiritual idea that souls or spirits exist
not only in humans but also in animals, plants, rocks, natural phenomena such as thunder, geographic features such as
mountains or rivers, or other entities of the natural environment.
Eskimos traditionally find a stone and take it into their igloo for the winter night. In the dark and using touch, they discover the
inner spirit of the stone and then carve it so that the stone takes the form of the spirit. This is 'living stone' and not the pretty
things made for tourists.

According to Sir William Jones, philologist and scholar of ancient India:
“Meros is said by the Greeks to have been a mountain in India, on which their Dionysos was born, and that Meru, though it
generally means the north pole in Indian geography, is also a mountain near the city of Naishada or Nysa, called by the Greek
geographers Dionysopolis, and universally celebrated in the Sanskrit poems”.
In the founding myth, the name of the town Paphos is linked to the goddess, as the eponymous Paphos was the son of
Pygmalion (Pygmalion's father was Belus, simply "lord" - as in "Baal") and his ivory cult image of Aphrodite, which was brought
to life by the Goddess as "milk-white" Galatea.

In the year since we began publishing our studies on divine men in Classical Antiquity, there have been developments in both our thinking and in both public and scholarly responses. New terms such as panhellenism and chrestic have appeared in order to describe the archaeology being examined. Numerous entries in Wikipedia have been revised (by others, always) to account for these developments and discussions initiated in other forums.
Perhaps the most surprising discovery is somewhat akin to the famous Holmesian episode in which the dog didn’t bark in the night.
Not a single artefact of any medium – including textual – and dated reliably before the fourth century can be unambiguously identified as Christian. This is the most notable result of our archaeological survey of sites, inscriptions, libraries, collections and so on from the Indus River to the Nile and north to Britain.
Taking into account the vast volume of scholarly works claiming expert opinion for the exact opposite point of view, let me clarify terms.

There is, of course, much archaeology interpreted commonly as Christian. This does not contradict the bald statement above. The difference lies between data that spells out Christian clearly and unambiguously, and that which expert opinion claims to look as though it is Christian.
There are very many texts claimed to be Christian and composed before the fourth century, though the documents themselves are not dated to that early period. We have found no text before the fourth century which mentions either Jesus Christ, or the term ‘Christian’.
The earliest fragments and codex of the New Testament pre-date the fourth century, though nowhere in them have we found the key word Christ. Many biblical scholars claim that they do, but our visual inspection of them fails to find a single such usage of this term. We have been unable to find a single text transliterated correctly in this regard.
The codex was written in the 4th century. Between the 4th and 12th centurie seven or more editors worked on this codex, making it one of the most alter manuscripts in existence, with as many as 20,000 alterations.
As there are gospels and other texts of a religious character, so there is archaeology for places of worship and many artefacts: none spell Christian. Claims that any are Christian are, in fact, a matter of opinion only and we disagree with all such opinions.
Six months ago, this was a tentative view and during this time, many scholars have been asked – challenged even – to provide evidence of a contradictory nature and other than largely silence, the response has been supportive of this view. We did receive a list of (well-known) sites and events purported as Christian, though not a single artefact.
This should not be understood as a claim that nothing was happening in these three centuries that can be related to the appearance of Christianity in the fourth century. The archaeology that can be associated most-closely with Christianity is for the name Chrest, a magical Jesus Chrest and for ‘Servants of Jesus’. We have termed these chrestic. In ancient Greek, the pronunciation of both terms – Christ and Chrest – is identical as far as is known today and this acutely interesting and fortuitous linguistic circumstance facilitated the re-working of textual artefacts as well as recasting the entire context of the original theurgy related to the cult.

Order to arrest a Chrestian: 28 February, 256 CE An order from the head of the council of Oxyrhynchus to the police officers in a country village to arrest a man described as a Chrestian (lines 4-5). No reason for the arrest is given.
As Chrest was expunged from the New Testament and replaced with Christ, so the possibility arises that following the prosecution of chrestic followers by Diocletian – mis-termed commonly ‘The Great Persecution’ of Christians the chrestic archaeology record was wiped clean generally as far as possible.
Left: Arycanda (Lycia). In 311-312 delegates from one province asked the emperor to make those “atheists,” the _ _ _ _ _tians, stop violating the rules of piety. To that end, they were to be forbidden from engaging in their execrable practices and ordered to worship the gods. (Museum of Istanbul) Note that the letters – along the left edge – which would have spelt either Chres or Chris have been destroyed.
What about outside the Roman empire: Persia for example?
That there was a substantial Christian population in Persia at the time Shapur II reigned in the 4th century is widely accepted as fact, though it is based on a later claim (Salminius Hermias Sozomenus fl. c. 400 – c. 450). Eusebius of Caesarea in his Life of Constantine:
Life of Constantine (Book III) Chapter 7. Of the General Council, at which Bishops from all Nations were Present. In effect, the most distinguished of God’s ministers from all the churches which abounded in Europe, Lybia, and Asia were here assembled. And a single house of prayer, as though divinely enlarged, sufficed to contain at once Syrians and Cilicians, Phœnicians and Arabians, delegates from Palestine, and others from Egypt; Thebans and Libyans, with those who came from the region of Mesopotamia. A Persian bishop too was present at this conference, nor was even a Scythian found wanting to the number.
Life of Constantine (Book IV) Chapter 8. That he wrote also to the King of Persia, who had sent him an Embassy, on Behalf of the Christians in his Realm. The king of the Persians also having testified a desire to form an alliance with Constantine, by sending an embassy and presents as assurances of peace and friendship, the emperor, in negotiating this treaty, far surpassed the monarch who had first done him honor, in the magnificence with which he acknowledged his gifts. Having heard, too, that there were many churches of God in Persia, and that large numbers there were gathered into the fold of Christ, full of joy at this intelligence, he resolved to extend his anxiety for the general welfare to that country also, as one whose aim it was to care for all alike in every nation.
Chapter 9. Letter of Constantine Augustus to Sapor, King of the Persians, containing a truly Pious Confession of God and Christ. Copy of his Letter to the King of Persia.
By keeping the Divine faith, I am made a partaker of the light of truth: guided by the light of truth, I advance in the knowledge of the Divine faith. Hence it is that, as my actions themselves evince, I profess the most holy religion; and this worship I declare to be that which teaches me deeper acquaintance with the most holy God; aided by whose Divine power, beginning from the very borders of the ocean, I have aroused each nation of the world in succession to a well-grounded hope of security; so that those which, groaning in servitude to the most cruel tyrants and yielding to the pressure of their daily sufferings, had well near been utterly destroyed, have been restored through my agency to a far happier state. This God I confess that I hold in unceasing honor and remembrance; this God I delight to contemplate with pure and guileless thoughts in the height of his glory.
The letter - even if genuine - fails to support the claims made of it, not mentioning either Christ, or Christian. The challenge is to find archaeological evidence in Persia for these Christians.

Left: Fragment of decorated plaster from the church excavated on Sir Bani Yas island, Abu Dhabi in the Persian Gulf. Dated to ca 6th century.
Christians reached the ancient Perat d’Maishan (now Basra), near the shores of the Persian Gulf by the beginning of the fourth century and around 325, Bishop David of Perat d’Maishan, according to the Chronicle of Seert, was present at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. A Nestorian bishopric was established in 424 at Rev-ardashir, nearly opposite the island of Kharg.
Nestorianism is a Christological doctrine advanced by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428–431, condemned as heretical at the First Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451, leading to the Nestorian Schism in which churches supporting Nestorius broke with the rest of the Christian Church. Afterward many of Nestorius’ supporters relocated to Sassanid Persia.
There is much Christian archaeology in the Persian Gulf, dating from the fifth and sixth centuries, but not for the first three centuries of this era.
Although Christians may have been among the deportees from Roman Syria who worked on the monuments of Šapur I (240-70 c.e.) at Bisaput (q.v.) and the dam at Sustar, nothing identifiably Christian has been excavated in Persia itself. (CHRISTIANITY, LL. IQ PUHIVODPLF PHUVLD: MDWHULDO RHPDLQV, by Judith Lerner)
That is the crux of the matter, right across Christendom.
Right: Cast of the inscription of Abercius, episkopos of Hierapolis in Phrygia. The original stands in the Vatican Museums and is dated ca. 200 CE. (Picture by Giovanni Dall’Orto, April 12 2008)
Translation: The citizen of a chosen city, this [monument] I made [while] living, that there I might have in time a resting-place of my body, [I] being by name Abercius, the disciple of a holy shepherd who feeds flock s of sheep [both] on mountains and on plains, who has great eyes that see everywhere. For this [shepherd] taught me [that the] book [of life] is worthy of belief. And to Rome he sent me to contemplate majesty, and to see a queen goldenrobed and golden-sandalled; there also I saw a people bearing a shining mark . And I saw the land of Syria and all [its] cities; Nisibis [I saw] when I passed over Euphrates. But everywhere I had brethren. I had Paul « Faith everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands from a fountain and this it [faith] ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread. These things I, Abercius, having been a witness [of them] told to be written here. Verily I was passing through my seventy-second year. He that discerneth these things, every fellow-believer [namely], let him pray for Abercius. And no one shall put another grave over my grave; but if he do, then shall he pay to the treasury of [the] Romans two thousand pieces of gold and to my good native city of Hieropolis one thousand pieces of gold.
Though regarded commonly as the earliest Christian inscription, the lack of clear identification has suggested numerous alternatives. In our opinion, the ‘Good Shepherd’ motif therein, based probably on imagery used in Psalm 23, then the allegorical story of the Good Shepherd (John 9:35-41 and John 10:22-30) and the Shepherd of Hermas, indicates a chrestic faith.
Left: The Good Shepherd. Painting on the ceiling of S. Callisto catacomb. Mid 3rd century CE.
The Shepherd of Hermas, a strange allegory written sometime in the second century, had a great vogue in orthodox circles and was even included in some copies of the New Testament (it is found in the Sinaitic Codex). The theology of the Church must have been very elastic at a time when such a book could enjoy popularity and implicit, if not explicit, ecclesiastical sanction, for its Christology does not seem to square with any of the Christologies of the New Testament, or with those of contemporary theologians whose occasional documents have reached us. The Shepherd speaks of a Son of God; but this Son of God is distinguished from Jesus. (Jesus Not a Myth, pp. 120-121, by A. D. Howell-Smith)
The site of Dura Europos, a former city and walled fortification in Syria on what was then the Roman-Persian frontier and sacked by Shapur I of Persia in 256/7 C.E, was excavated largely in the 1920s and 1930s by French and American teams. Within the archaeological site and located by the 17th tower, preserved by the same defensive fill that saved the nearby Dura Europos synagogue, is what is claimed to be the earliest identified Christian church house. The surviving frescoes of the baptistry room are claimed by most experts to be probably the most ancient Christian

paintings, though more crudely executed than the paintings of the nearby synagogue.
The Good Shepherd, Adam and Eve. Wall painting in the baptistry of the domus ecclesiae in Dura Europos.
Fragments of parchment scrolls with Hebrew texts of Eucharistic prayers have also been unearthed. In 1933, among fragments of text recovered from the town dump outside the Palmyrene Gate, a fragmentary text (Dura Parchment 24) was unearthed from an unknown Greek harmony of the gospel accounts, comparable to Tatian’s Diatessaron, though independent of it. The fragment was found in an earth embankment believed to have been built for the final defense of the town. It was fairly close to the domus ecclesiae, though far enough away that it may have come from some other source.
The fragment contains phrases also found in Matt. 27:56-57, Mark 15:40, 42, Luke 23:49, 50, 51, John 19:38. The reconstruction of Parker, Taylor, and Goodacre differs in only a few particulars, though some of the differences are significant. The manuscript has some unusual orthographic features, including a Nominum Sacrum found nowhere else, with uncertain meaning. Tatian does not mention either Jesus, or Christ.
Archaeologists determined three stages for this site: an earlier dwelling; a private house nearly 18 m square and 5.2 m high, with eight rooms and a courtyard; then adaptation – probably between 232/233 and 236 – as the domus ecclesiae. To achieve this third stage, an interior wall had been demolished to make a hall capable of accommodating some 65-75 persons. The hall is decorated with a Bacchic plaster freize.
A trading post of the Silk Road, with Roman garrison, is an unlikely hideaway for “the poor” and oppressed, and the status of the house is not one would associate with slaves and the underclass. Rather, it is at one with the elite Romans, Greeks and provincial royalty populating the Pauline canon, the Neopythagorean basilica in Rome, and other individuals we identify as chrestic. The site contains no reference to a Jesus Christ, or to Christians.
Scholars are assuming that because there must be Christianity in the first three centuries, they have a divine right to interpret Chrest as Christ and Christian-like symbols as Christian, and so appear to prove their own false-assumption. It is very poor thinking and near-universal for centuries.
The term Christ is English for the Greek Khristós meaning “the anointed one”. Chrest does not interpret in this manner, but as “Good” and is not interchangeable with “Messiah”.
Our search for Christian archaeology in the first three centuries has instead revealed an increasing quantity of chrestic.
The immediate challenge is therefore to understand in what manner the pre-fourth century Jesus is “Good”. The starting point is the context in which this Greek Jesus is termed “Good” in Greek texts and Greek magic.
That this context is not Jewish must be both noted and important, for it may lead to a better understanding of much archaeology which has the superficial appearance of being Jewish, through – for example – the appearance of Hebraic symbols and names in Greek magic of the period. That the central story and heroes of the New Testament have a Judaean setting and character is not coincidental, but central.

In the reign of King Tiberius Julius Rescuporis, friend of Caesar and friend of the Romans, pious, in the year 377, the twelfth of the month of Pereitios, I Chreste, former wife of Drusus, release in the synagogue, my home-bred slave Heraclas, free, once and for all, according to my vow, who is to be undisturbed and unharmed by all of my heirs, and who may go wherever he desires, unhindered, as I have vowed, except that he show devotion and diligence toward the synagogue with the agreement both of my heirs Heraclides and Heliconias and also under the joint guardianship of the congregation of the Jews. (The Jewish manumission inscriptions of the Bosporus Kingdom by Elizabeth Leigh Gibson)
Such archaeology, which includes that for the earliest synagogues, challenges our present understanding of Jewish identity.
The ‘spiritual’ home of chrestic archaeology – the chrestic movement – is clearly Alexandria and most likely the Royal Library there. Yet it is found across the Hellenistic world, most particularly within the Persian orbit, from those small kingdoms contested with Rome, to Parthia and Greco-India.
This is no longer a complete surprise, at least to us and our readers, as we have traced the activities of those Ptolemies whom we label Lysimachi, Greeks claiming Jewish affiliation in one generation and none as they butcher Jews in the next. Their primary interest is dynastic power, to reclaim the inheritance of the Diadochi Lysimachus, and their means is to leverage Roman power and income from trade to reshape Judaism – and when that fails in the chrestic period, to make anew.
The term used commonly for Greek faith in their divinities is ‘pagan’ and we find this inadequate, an inadequacy which becomes increasingly apparent in considering chrestic archaeology, as Helios transmutes into divine men such as Buddha and Christ, hence our usage of the term panhellenism.
The greatest challenge faced by scholarship in this field is to escape “the glittering web” of false assumptions and rather, to ground thinking within a secure framework of reliable archaeology. This will lead to profound change. The history of the Roman Empire – how it came into being, how it related to both Judaism and the panhellenic world, and how it moved into the Byzantine period – begs revision. The history of divine men has yet to be written.
If these FRPPHQWV E\ WKHRORJ\ VWXGHQWV are any indication, that time would be a long way off:
anyone who thinks that Christianity did not exist prior to nicea is a moron who can’t conduct good historical practice and sullies the graves of martyrs. No I’m not interested in debating with him, just general pointers to early Christianity. In this line of thinking it was probably his mother. Sorry, but the guy is a maggot, engaged in deliberate falsification. I will give this the time of day as soon as you convince a serious academic journal with expert peer review to publish it. Until then I can’t justify the time investment to consider this rather unlikely proposal, and neither should anyone else. ...nearly all the IIDB regulars think he’s off his rocker. Textually speaking, we have NTs that predate Constantine. Within the skeptical community, those who agree with him are probably about as numerous, relatively speaking, as snake-handlers are within the Christian community. ...doesn’t have a friggin’ idea about christology. What I think he doesn’t have a friggin idea about is historiography.
The difficulties in approaching this subject have long been recognised:
It has always been an unfailing source of astonishment to the historical investigator of Christian beginnings, that there is not one single word from the pen of any Pagan writer of the first century of our era, which can in any fashion be referred to the marvellous story recounted by the Gospel writers. The very existence of Jesus seems unknown. – Mead, G.R.S., Did Jesus Live 100 Years BC?, 1903, pp.324, 48
The subject has not become any easier:
The material culture of ritual activities, iconography, holy places, much less belief itself have a far more contested discourse both within the specific field of Early Christian archaeology (how can you be sure that the people were Christian?) and within the field of archaeology more broadly. One of the key powers of an Early Christian archaeology is its ability to force archaeologists to problematize religion (and its myriad manifestations) as a category of archaeological analysis in general. Bowes touches upon some of these things in her article — noting the difficulty in identifying monastic establishments (598-602), the archaeological ephemeral nature of of house churches (579-582), and the religious ambiguity of the catacombs (582-586) — but does not really engage the significance of this debate. If Christianity (and religion more generally) ends up being a relatively unimportant (or invisible) component in the material assemblage marking individual identity in Late Antiquity, where does that leave the discipline of Early Christian archaeology? – Considering Early Christian Archaeology by Bill Caraher, a review of Early Christian Archaeology: A State of the Field by Kim Bowes, Cornell University (July 2008)
Where, indeed?

Dear Readers,
This post is being discussed by others, across the web, more than all our other posts combined and not a single example of the term Christ
or Christian from before the 4th century has been offered in refutation.
There is some continued confusion, however, between fact and opinion, which should not surprise, as we see examples of such confusion
every day in news reporting.
It is a fact that many hold the opinion that there is christian archaeology in the 3rd century; it is not a fact - as far as I am aware - that there
is such archaeology.
To be more definitive: we have not found a single usage of the term 'Christ' in any text, sacred or otherwise, which can be dated directly to
any time before the 4th century.
This, despite an enormous number of claims to the contrary, including authoritative, letter-by-letter transliterations - all of which are factually
wrong.
How can centuries of scholarship be wrong on a matter of fact?
Because they assume that an abbreviation can be a 'nomina sacra' - a sacred name - and, believing in either Christ, or the judgment of
others who believe in Christ - understand such an abbreviation to translate to 'Christ'. Also, because monks falsified scared texts on a
massive scale, vast amounts of archaeological evidence have been destroyed, and even when Chrest is written clearly, it has been
'translated' as Christ.
If we assume this was not all fraud, then these false translations are based on assumptions - the presumed scholarship for Christianity is no
more than a house of cards.
Archaeologists work within the historical framework given to them, so all the archaeology is interpreted on these assumptions. The
archaeology must also be no more reliable than the proverbial.
That's 1,700 years of scholarship blown away.
The notion that christianity has a solid basis in history and archaeology is demonstrably false, as we show here. That is but one conclusion,
for there are many more to be drawn on this. There are many other divine men in Classical Antiquity, produced by the same chrestic
process and scholars have largely failed to treat them with any more intellectual integrity than they have the Greek magical Jesus.
Best regards,
John

VERY interesting article! A while back I came across some photos of the Street of Tombs in the basement of St Peter's Basilia in Rome
and it turns out that the word that's supposed to be "Christians" is spelt "Chrestians!" Now I wish I bookmarked the link.
And the P66 payrus from 200 CE, as I remember, substituted Chi-Rho grams for "Christos" (that's the popular assumption) or "Chrestos,"

Chi-Iota grams for "Iesous Christos" or "Iesous Chrestos" and Tau-Rho grams for "Stauros," the last an inadvertent representation of the wax
image of Julius Caesar on his funerary tropaeum, 3-18-44 BCE.
Third thing, the word Christian en français is... "chrétien."
Yes, 1,700 years of scholarship all for nought. Looks like Constantine DID invent Christianity at Nicaea in 325 CE... either that or he totally
re-invented it.
And another thing that people have all wrong is the Roman practice of crucfixion, but I won't go into that now except to say that it was...
nasty.

Thank you for your observations and comments on this subject, Edward; I've been wondering about the French term.
In the last few days, I've added two sections to our Catalogue of Chrest: Marcion and Manichaeism, for both used the term Chrestos. The
two may be further related, for both had a presence in the same general area, which included Mesopotamia. Is this how Thomas appears in
India?
On the other hand, where are the pre-4th century 'churches' in the West? The archaeology of the very few sites thought to be 'Christian' (i.e.
Chrestian) is not as clear as has been claimed. The Megiddo 'church' for example, is for Chrest, not Christ - it is spelled out in a mosaic
and I suspect that interpretations of the data are superficial, based as they are on the assumption it must all be Christian.
Right now, the earliest 'churches' seem to me to be chrestic synagogues and maybe all are Marcionite. The earliest in Rome is a
Mithraeum in the 2nd century and the Basilica di San Clemente atop is 4th century.
The appearance of chrestic synagogues (with the lack of contemporaneous churches) in the first centuries is likely associated with Marcion
regarding Paul as the chief apostle of his Isu Chrestos. I hope that if we can understand Saul/Paul and why they made and used chrestic
synagogues, we may better understand how Greeks made a new faith with many Judiac and Hebraic elements.
I am also coming to the view that the "domus ecclesiae" at Dura Europos is a chrestic synagogue, but more on that at another time.

Actually the mosaic shown does not spell it out, it abbreviates it! Is there another mosaic that spells it out completely? Either way, your
hypothesis that XW is Chrestos from what I've seen is more solidly based on fact. Christos? That hyposthesis has 1,700 years of tradition
behind it.

You're welcome!
By the way, have you been keeping up with the recent Lead Codices controversy out of Israel, Jordan, Great Britain and France? That
they're evidence for Christianity as early as 33 CE, or have ties into the "Jesus Legacy" like the discredited "James Ossuary" and "Jesus
Family Tomb?" If they're genuine, they could be evidence of first-century Chrestianity, for it was common for lead to be used in curse tablets
back then.

This is interesting if you also add to this the Jewish view of "Jesus". The Talmud speaks (very very little) of a "Yeshu" who holds some
ressemblance to Jesus. But it appears that "Yeshu" here is at least 2 different people, one living in the 2nd century and one living in the 1st
century BCE. Regarding the latter, the Talmud notes that he created a sort of hellenistic cult that still existed dozen of years later. Some
rabbis thought in the Middle-Ages that he was the historical Jesus.

Benben: Thank you for that informative comment and I would appreciate learning the exact reference for the latter (BCE) "Yeshu".
A subject we have yet to explore here is the term 'Servant of Jesus' used as the name of a Thracian priest of Dionysus in the late 1st
century BCE, and as a Parthian royal title in the 1st century of this era. I suspect that both usages are connected in some manner to both
Krestonia (western Thrace, between the Strymon and the Axios) and to the Gondophares dynasty (KWWS://HQ.ZLNLSHGLD.RUJ/ZLNL/G....

I'm not sure why you expect there to be any such unambiguous artefact from this period? Christains were being widely persecuted by the
Roman (and Jewish) authorities, so the Christians would want to disguise and hide their artefacts and the authorities would want to destroy
anything they found. It is likely that few early items would have survived the period intact, and the chances of any surviving another 1600
years must be slim.

Rob: What I expect is unambiguous evidence for unambiguous claims. For example, you claim here "Christains were being widely
persecuted by the Roman (and Jewish) authorities, so the Christians would want to disguise and hide their artefacts and the
authorities would want to destroy anything they found."
I therefore expect you to support your unambiguous claims - for Christians, their "persecutions" (as opposed to mere prosecution
under Roman law), and that Romans needed to try and hide the evidences of their legal processes - with unambiguous evidence.
Where is it?

So, RobM, you know of these 'persecutions' because the evidence was hidden? I don't follow your logic. For you to claim there were
persecutions, you need reliable evidence - as the author of this piece is saying.
We have records for Diocletian prosecuting Manicheans and the contemporaneous written records of this Faith mention a 'Jesus Chrest':
KWWS://KLVWRU\KXQWHUVLQWHUQDWL...
"The form 'Chrestos', that is "Jesus the Good," is found throughout the text. (Emerging from darkness: studies in the recovery of
Manichaean sources By Paul Allan Mirecki, Jason BeDuhn, Volume 43 of Nag Hammadi and Manichaean studies, BRILL, 1997)"
It is possible that the prosecution of Manichaeans was conflated in the 4th century with the Chrestians of the 3rd century, called Christian in
the 4th. This would explain how we have legal records for Manichaeans and Chrestians being prosecuted, but none for Christians.
Either way, as every town in the empire had to declare its loyalty - we see an image of one such declaration, in the article above - where are
they? There ought to be many remains of these. Imperial Rome wouldn't have destroyed them - Rome demanded them displayed - so they
have gone somewhere. What do you think happened to them?

Interesting anecdote in AmmianXs MarcellinXs 21.16.18 about Constantius Augustus: "The plain and simple religion of the Christians he
obscured by a dotard's superstition, and by subtle and involved discussions about dogma, rather than by seriously trying to make them
agree,௙he aroused many controversies; and and as these spread more and more, he fed them with contentious words. And since throngs of
bishops hastened hither and thither on the public post-horses to the various synods, as they call them, while he sought to make the whole
ritual conform to his own will, he cut the sinews of the courier-service."

What the site considers "crux" has been bashed in so I can't verify for sure and "(Iesus) (Christ)i" I read as the following abbreviation: "Ihc

This is another example of circular thinking being used to provide its own proof: start with a tradition, use that to interpret the
archaeology, then use the archaeology to support the claim; repeat.
In the first example here, the findspot is unrecorded, location unknown. The letters used for the title are "XP".
As the oldest texts we have use abbreviations and 'Chrest', we ought properly, I think, to assume that "XP" should read "Chrest".
Here's a challenge: what reliably-dated archaeology do we have for the first clear, unambiguous use of the term "Christ" - when does
it first appear in a "Christian" context?

First clear, unambiguous use of the term "Christ?" Apart from a magical amulet that has been assessed to date from the
2nd or 3rd Century CE I have not found anything. And even the gem itself is iffy.
The inscription reads, "ΥIE –-–-– ΠAT – HPIH – COΥX –-–-– PICTE" which becomes ΥIE ΠATHP IHCOΥ XPICTE, in
essence "Yie Pater Iesou Christe". But it also mentions Egyptian names Badetophoth and Satraperkmepthe, which are
names of Egyptian occult names. It also portrays "Christe" in a humiliating pose on the cross; it looks like he is hanging
while impaled from underneath. Obviously, this gem is not Chrestian (or Christian for that matter) and therefore XPICTE
could be a misspelling of XRHCTE.
There is also a reference to "Christians" in Pompeii that referred to them as cruel haters. Obviously written by a non
Christian hand. It was scribbled in charcoal just before the volcano blew up, but then again, "Christiani" could have been a
misspelling of "Chrestiani" which may have been derived to mean bankers from the Greek χρῆσται (chrestai) meaning
creditors, duns or usurers and also debtors (LSJ Lexicon).

River to the Nile and north to Britain.Taking into account the vast volume of scholarly works claiming expert opinion for the exact opposite
point of view, let me clarify terms.There is, of course, much archaeology interpreted commonly as Christian. This does not contradict the
bald statement above. The difference lies between data that spells out Christian clearly and unambiguously, and that which expert opinion
claims to look as though it is Christian.There are very many texts claimed to be Christian and composed before the fourth century, though
the documents themselves are not dated to that early period. We have found no text before the fourth century which mentions either Jesus
Christ, or the term ‘Christian’.""The greatest challenge faced by scholarship in this field is to escape “the glittering web” of false

"1. The Greek word translated in English as "Christ" is itself a translation of the Hebrew "Messiah", and there are many, many uses of that
word, in both Jewish and Christian writings. For example, Josephus, writing in the late first century says: "so he assembled the sanhedrin of
judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others". Likewise Paul's
letters, most of whom historians accept were written by him in the middle of the first century, obviously mention Jesus and Messiah.2. Your
claim appears to be not only that the word "Christ" doesn't appear, but that "Not a single artefact of any medium – including textual – and
dated reliably before the fourth century can be unambiguously identified as Christian." What then do you make of the Rylands papyrus P52,
dated to the first half of the second century, and which contains a small section of text from John's Gospel which reads:the Jews, "For us it
is not permitted to killanyone," so that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he sp-oke signifying what kind of death he was going todie.
Entered therefore again into the Praeto-rium Pilate and summoned Jesusand said to him, "Thou art king of theJews?"This indicates that
John's gospel, one of the most developed pieces of christian theology at the time and surely a christian textual artefact, was around in the
early second century.So what exactly do you mean? Do you not accept that these, and many, many other documents, are christian, or that
they are first and second century, or what?"

Quote:There is no appeals to HP Blavatsky, the context of what the author was saying is as follows:What follows is a large quotation from

but also to someone who is demonstrably wrong.Quote:Further, let everyone read it for themselves and offer any evidence against what the

Sure; read a standard professional Greek lexicon and see what it says about the words 'Christ' and 'Christian'.Quote:It has been said that
Newton was very interested in Alchemy and the Bible yet it was his scientific theories(facts) that are at the foundations of modern science.
His musings on Alchemy and the Bible have no categorically no value!As I have said, I am not objecting to Blavatsky on the basis that she
was religious.
RESPONSE #6
Sure: every piece of Christian literature written before the 4th Century - and there's a lot of it. Where do you think it all came from? Who
wrote it? For what purpose?Even if it was true that the word 'Christ' and 'Christians' do not appear in any pre-4th Century manuscript, how
does this prove Christianity did not exist? 'Christian' was a rarely used term anyway, and only appears two or three times in the entire NT.
This is a classic case of arbitrarily defining parameters as narrowly as possible in order to exclude evidence that would otherwise disprove
the claim being made.The conspiracy theory touted by 'History Hunters International' is not a new one. Every now and then it is revived by
some crank who believes he knows better than the experts. A recent example is Peter R. F. Brown (ZZZ.PRXQWDLQPDQ.FRP.DX) who
audaciously submitted his work to the Journal of Hellenic Studies.The reply was as follows:Quote:Dear Dr Brown,I have now had the

not be able to publish the piece. I hope the reports are self-explanatory and helpful.I am sorry the outcome has not been happier, but I am

CONSTANTINE’S INVENTION OF CHRISTIANITYThis is a revival of the theses of Athanasius Kircher and the AbbÈ Hardouin, who (in the
hope of disarming the protestant appeal to primitive Christianity) argued that the whole corpus of ancient literature, including the Fathers, up
to about 900 A.D. is a forgery. The reasoning of Kircher was based on the absence of numismatic corroboration for the written
testimonies.The argument has never been regarded as anything more than a curiosity, since it presupposes a quite stupendous power of
obliteration which the rulers of ancient empires could not have possessed. Furthermore, the argument is based almost entirely on the
absence of substantiating evidence rather than on positive contradiction of the scribal record in the archaeological remains.Even if such
positive contradiction were discovered, it would not of course be decisive, as inscriptions and coins can be at least as duplicitous as books
– more so, perhaps, since the very production of them is an indication that the author is in a position of power and means to retain it.The
present work improves on Hardouin and Kircher, of course, in its knowledge of epigraphic sources, and some of these, for all I know, may be
handled here with originality. The paucity of epigraphic evidence for early Christianity is, of course, commonly admitted, but this has not led
most scholars to argue that the entire corpus of Christian literature before 325 is a fabrication.If it were, one would have expected the forgers

to carry out the enterprise with some doctrinal consistency: why fabricate heretical writings in the name of Origen, for example, while
continuing to appeal to his authority? Why compose the gospels in a homely and obscure idiom which could not fail to bring the authors
into disrepute among cultivated readers? Why were “orthodox” writers after Nicaea repeatedly embarrassed by the discovery of tenets
contradictory to their own in venerable predecessors?Archaeological data are never self-interpreting, and since they are generally fortuitous
survivals they are even less likely to be representative than the literary texts that have been handed down to us by a deliberate process of
canonisation. The assumption that they can be used to construct a history independent of literary sources is surely fallacious.The
fundamental fallacies are compounded in this book by wilful embellishment of such textual evidence as the author deigns to adduce in
support of his case. Julian is accusing the evangelists of fiction, rather than imputing a wholesale forgery to Constantine (whom he would
have incriminated if he could); Constantine’s admission that the Sibylline oracles were accused of forgery is hardly proof that the
authenticity of all other texts had been impugned.The scholarship is certainly superior to that of The Da Vinci Code, and the boldness of the
argument will guarantee it a hearing, but not any distinguished organ of academic research.I see no evidence that 'History Hunters
International' have improved on Mr Brown's amateurish efforts. Incidentally, Brown is not a Dr in any sense of the word (you can check his
CV here: ZZZ.PRXQWDLQPDQ.FRP.DX/FY_LQ_L... ) but apparently thought it might help his chances if he told JHS that he was.
RESPONSE # 7
Here are some of the arguments made.1. Pliny's correspondence apparently referring to Christians only survive in one very late medieval
manuscript. Because this manuscript is very late, it is unreliable and does not show us what Pliny originally wrote. The original reading was
actually 'Chrestians', which was changed to 'Christians' by later Christian copyists. No evidence is supplied to prove this claim.2. Most of
the New Testament was written by servants of the Flavian emperors. Vespasian and Titus in particular, employed a large number of men to
write histories which would become used as the basis of the New Testament documents. The New Testament books could not have been
written and distributed without imperial consent and assistance, since 'it was impossible for any philosopher, much less slave, in this period
to write, publish and gain a readership outside the authority of the court'. No evidence is supplied to support this claim.3. The canonical
gospels are 'Roman-inspired black propaganda, belonging to the reign of the emperor Hadrian and published with the approval of the imperial
court'. No evidence is supplied to support this claim.4. The works of Robert Eisenman ('James the brother of Jesus' and 'The New Testament
Code'), and Joseph Atwill ('Caesar's Messiah', referred to as a 'ground-breaking work'), are appealed to as 'modern, scholarly views'. In
reality, Eisenman's works are considered highly eccentric by modern scholarship, and Atwill's work is dismissed completely. Even Robert
Price (to whom this site appeals as an authority), ridiculed Atwill's work in his review of it[link to amazon].* 'Such a statement is only a
damning self-condemnation, revealing the author’s own absolute inability to appreciate what he is reading'* 'Of such airy bricks is Atwill’s
cloudy castle built'* 'No, it is Atwill himself whose creation demonstrates the limitless possibilities of perverse and gratuitous interpretations
of the text'* 'The reading given here is just ludicrous'

Oh good grief, it's the old 'Flavian mafia made it all up' conspiracy theory. Not even unique; not even interesting.
RESPONSE #9
Yes, just another spin on the completely insignificant work of Abelard Reuchlin.

Many thanks, documentus, for this summary of responses from another place, which illuminate how nobody has yet been able to offer even
the slightest evidence for the appearance of 'Christ' in any form (e.g "Jesus Christ", "Christian" and "Christianity") in any medium dated
reliably before the 4th century. (I venture to suggest that the apologists demonstrate that they cannot, as they squirm to evade the issue.)
I like this response particularly, telling how so much of Faith is based on false assumptions:
"Sure: every piece of Christian literature written before the 4th Century - and there's a lot of it. Where do you think it all came from? Who
wrote it? For what purpose?Even if it was true that the word 'Christ' and 'Christians' do not appear in any pre-4th Century manuscript, how
does this prove Christianity did not exist?"If there were to be so much early literature, then referencing it would be easy, would it not? That
nobody can do so is simply because it does not exist and instead, is assumed from the acceptance of the literature by the purported
'Eusebius of Caesarea', a nom de plume with no substance in the early 4th century whatsoever. That's right: there is no historicity for this
character - his existence is also a matter of faith. That's the meaning of the term "glittering web" - a mass of self-supporting cross
references with no substance.
Since writing the above piece, I would push the boundary a little further, with the suggestion that the earliest biblical texts to use 'Christ' are
from the 5th century:
1. The Arian bible - Codex Argenteus (KWWS://ZZZ.XE.XX.VH/HQ/CROOHFW... and
2. Codex Alexandrinus (KWWS://HQ.ZLNLSHGLD.RUJ/ZLNL/C....
I would continue to await somebody to present something substantial to refute my observation, but I'm not optimistic and I won't be holding
my breath. Meanwhile, let the apologists continue to squirm.

HHI,
I note your failure to address any of the points which have been raised thus far. I appreciate there are many of them, and it may take you
some time. But you will need to come up with a substantive reply. What you have posted so far is not a substantive reply. Instead of
addressing the evidence you have merely repeated your argument.
>>

Where is the false assumption here? You make the claim but offer no proof.
You are of course aware that there is currently a vast body of evidence universally accepted by academic consensus (both religious and
secular) as clear and unambiguous evidence of Christianity and Christians before the 4th Century. This includes manuscripts, non-Christian
references to Christians and Christianity, and religious artwork. The burden of proof lies upon you to disprove this body of evidence. To date I
have seen no argument on this site that disproves the evidence.

Absolutely, and you are doubtless aware of it but I'll indulge you for a moment. Here's a list of early documents providing evidence for pre-4th
Century Christianity: ZZZ.HDUO\FKULVWLDQZULWLQJV.FRP
Please address each one separately and explain why we should reject it.
The
biggest question is one which your site apparently makes no attempt to
answer: what would you accept as evidence of Christianity before the 4th Century? Please define this clearly, as it is critical to your thesis.

Dear Dave,
Though you have not registered in order to comment, which is remiss of you, I have allowed it to appear.
You have published elsewhere about yourself, your faith, and your long experience in debating issues which interest you.
(KWWS://OKLP.RUJ/EORJ/2010/02/0... I have no obligation and feel no compunction in enjoining what tends to be an endless battle of
words and wits. Rather, I will stick to the thrust of this post:
> Not a single artefact of any medium -- including textual -- and dated reliably before the fourth century can be unambiguously
identified as Christian. This is the most notable result of our archaeological survey of sites, inscriptions, libraries, collections and so
on from the Indus River to the Nile and north to Britain.
> Taking into account the vast volume of scholarly works claiming expert opinion for the exact opposite point of view, let me clarify
terms.
> There is, of course, much archaeology interpreted commonly as Christian. This does not contradict the bald statement above. The
difference lies between data that spells out Christian clearly and unambiguously, and that which expert opinion claims to look as
though it is Christian.
> There are very many texts claimed to be Christian and composed before the fourth century, though the documents themselves are
not dated to that early period. We have found no text before the fourth century which mentions either Jesus Christ, or the term
‘Christian’.
As I mentioned earlier, I now suggest that this vacuum of evidence extends to the 5th century.
The proper refutation of this would be, of course, to present some evidence and see if I can deny that it mentions "Christ" in some
form and that it is dated reliably. Nothing less will serve.
I will not allow this post and discussion to be diverted much beyond that, your debating tactics not withstanding.

Should I, for example, serve the purpose of the apologists by presenting the arguments made in order to interpret archaeology as
Christian? I think not. There is much archaeology dated reasonably reliably to the early centuries and interpreted as Christian - I
have mentioned this already - but as it fails to mention 'Christ' in any form and fails to convince me as being "clearly and
unambiguously" Christian, my observation does not need it.
You (and anyone else) are welcome to present archaeology that may seem to refute my observation and then I may respond to that.
I hope this is clear to you.
All the best,

'Unambiguously identified as Christian' sounds like weasel words (KWWS://ELW.O\/WLCBZF) to me. What are your criteria for determining if
something is Christian or not? I have not found them listed anywhere on your website (it's possible I've overlooked them somehow). Do you
have a falsifiable position? If so, what would falsify it? Currently your thesis looks like a lengthy rendition of the 'no true Scotsman' fallacy
(KWWS://ELW.O\/XMXUF2).

Why will nothing less serve? Is this your sole criterion for determining whether something is Christian or not? If so, why? If not, what are
your other criteria and why did you choose them? Your reference to evidence being 'dated reliably' begs the question: what dating methods
do you consider reliable? From what I have read so far you appear to dismiss paleography on an ad hoc basis, which does not strike me as
an objective approach.
At the moment your method seems to be:
(a) select a single, extraordinarily narrow criterion and insist this it is only legitimate criterion, thereby excluding a vast swathe of data
contrary to your thesis
(b) dismiss any dating method which risks falsifying your thesis
I am open to correction on these points.
>>
Should I, for example, serve the purpose of the apologists by presenting the arguments made in order to interpret archaeology as Christian?
>>
That is not what I asked. I asked how *you* would determining if something was Christian or not. Do you have a systematic method for this
purpose? You need one, because how else will you assess the data?
May I presume you have submitted your theory to the rigours of peer review? I would be interested to see a list of relevant peer reviewed
journals which have published your work, and any responses from professional academics in an appropriate field.

Dear Dave,
First, I owe you some thanks, primarily for taking an interest in our studies at HHI (and also for registering). Also, I like your
questioning attitude, for this is surely a good approach to a subject.
I should also admit that I can be wrong - at times in my studies, I have blundered, but more importantly, this study here began as a
blog to record progress and so reflected a slow development of thought. Today, my views have changed substantially from my
starting position here, and that has also changed dramatically over the decades of study, before I wrote anything. My colleague and
I have discussed deleting this whole site and starting afresh and one day, perhaps we shall do this.
This subject - divine men in Classical Antiquity - is not my main field of interest in archaeology. And although it may seem from
some recent articles that I have an interest in Christian origins, that is not really the case - I have little interest in Christianity. 'Jesus
Christ' is just one of very many divine men in this period. I am just as interested in how Buddha, Pythagoras and Alexander (as well
as many others) came into existence as divine men. I should note at this point that some or all of these may have had some sort of
historical existence in earlier times - and this is one of the major complications we face. There are also different classes of divine
men, so that, for example, Roman emperors may be regarded as 'divine men' but of a different type to, say, Buddha and other
religious figures; but then again, maybe not so different and there lies another complexity.
Some of my colleagues publish in peer-reviewed journals, but so far, I have resisted. This is to change in the coming weeks.
Frankly, I do not like peer-review in this field, for I regard it as seriously skewed, to become unreliable. In my view, 'authority' is one
of the ways by which so much is generally regarded as 'fact' when it is scholarly opinion and wrong.
Perhaps I have been wrong to adopt the position of "the emperor has no clothes" and then ask for evidence that he has some. I can
say, however, that I have asked - challenged even - quite a large number of reputable scholars to either provide data to refute my
'vacuity' position, or just to learn their own position. I was aware how dangerous it is to say nothing exists, when even one piece of
reliable data could shatter the position.
It is not difficult to find claims for Christian archaeology in the early centuries, for anyone who is either interested, or desiring to
challenge our position, and I have mentioned it in HHI. We have treated, for example, gospel texts. I have mentioned claims for early
'churches' and showed a mosaic claimed to mention 'Jesus Christ' which actually has 'Krest/Chrest'.
If we had merely found nothing with 'Christ', then the position we adopt would be somewhat different. Instead, we found 'Is/Isu/Isa
Chrest' and the same divine figure in Manicheism of the 3rd century. This is just one small part of a larger history which we study,
for it is becoming apparent to us that this comes from the East, from Mesopotamia and beyond. From our perspective, Christianity
is medieval and derives from something else, with roots going back into the past era. Our interest now is in trying to describe this
and then, and only then, treating properly the development of various religions, including Christianity.
Dates: this is not a simple matter of just choosing a technology, or methodology which we can all agree is accurate. First, there are
the archaeological basics such as provenance and it is a pity that most 'biblical' texts fail to have any. Then there is the question of
security - does it comes from a secure layer and can the layer be dated, perhaps by other aretfacts or means? As for the different
dating technologies, they all come with caveats and limitations. Another factor is the ability of the archaeologist to interpret and I
have seen numerous examples of false assumptions being used. As a result, I try to treat each individually. That said, I have noticed
that with NT texts, there are regular attempts to try and force an ever-earlier date, closer to the time of the setting of the texts.
However, other than dating the canonical gospels, I think dating of artefacts is not the main problem for the historicity question.
More telling, I think, is that these texts do not contain a 'Jesus Christ'; that the history of the Church is based on the assumption
that the authors of them existed, existed in the time claimed, are who they claim to be and read the texts they claimed to have
used. That's a lot of assuming for a reliable history - and too much for me.
Sorry if this is not all you are looking for and I promise to not give up on this thread. Thanks again and
Best regards,
John

Dear Michael,
Perhaps you would be so kind as to select something from that source and present it here. I examined it whilst researching my
article and did not find reliable evidence for 'Christ' etc.
My logic, by the way, is not quite as simple as you present, for having found the "vacuum" I mentioned, I also found much data for
Chrest.
Do you have an explanation for the lack of 'Jesus Christ' in the earliest codices of the New Testament? And the lack of any
contemporaneous evidence for Eusebius of Caesarea, Origen and other "Christians"? I find it odd - to say the least - that anyone
should accept the existence of people who left no 'footprint' in the world and rely, instead on later, unsupported claims.

Please check the images I posted to avoid such a simple and wrong claim; yes, Codex Vaticanus uses
abbreviations which you term (in Latin) "nomina sacra", though Codex Sinaiticus, which I believe scholarship
generally regards as the version commission for Constantine I, does not, for it spells out both the name and title
"Chrest".
As an aside, I think you are wrong to use the term "nomina sacra" here, for this is not a religious site (as you surely
understand). A thing is what it is and in this case, an abbreviation.
I am not sure quite on what basis you might think I would not understand this term. "Chi Rho" has an interesting
archaeology dating well into the past era and is not a Christian symbol in the 4th century, though used famously by
Constantine and by Ptolemy III:

The archaeology looks to me as though the 'Jesus Christ' of the fifth century emerges from (a) Chi Rho and (b) a
first-century king using various royal titles such as "Saviour" (Soter) and "Good" (Chrest) - and this king may well be
Jewish, but he is clearly not of Judea (for we know the Herodian dynasty quite well).

Dear History Hunter John,
It should be mentioned that Codex Sinaiticus also used the nomina sacra, referred to as abbreviations to you, when referring to Jesus and it
indeed uses the eta spelling for Christian(s). But the iota spelling is used in Antichrist in the following verses:
1 John 2:18: KWWS://FRGH[VLQDLWLFXV.RUJ/HQ/...
1 John 2:22: KWWS://FRGH[VLQDLWLFXV.RUJ/HQ/...
2 John 1:7: KWWS://FRGH[VLQDLWLFXV.RUJ/HQ/...
Could you explain why the followers of Chrest would fear somebody named the Antichrist instead of the Antichrest if your theory is correct?
Kind regards.

Nomina Sacra are case sensitive in the hands of some scribes. In this particular case it appears that Sinaiticus scribe A declined the
nomen sacrum for IS XS (nom.) to the accusative masculine singular form IN XN.
So in the case of 2 John 7 we have: οτι πολλοι πλανοι εξηλθον εις τον κοσμον, οι μη ομολογουντες Ιησουν Χριστον ερχομενον εν σαρκι· ουτος
εστιν ο πλανος και ο αντιχριστος. (my color-coding does not appear in this comment option, so to be clear - the N endings terminating the
declension of Ιησουν Χριστον give us IN and XN - excuse the short hand).
The second element concerning the antichrist is a very perceptive and wonderful question and stands entirely to your credit
Ignorantianescia. John and I appreciate a well-aimed incisive inquiry that moves the discussion forward. I should also take this opportunity to
state categorically that I do not pretend to have all the answers for such a challenging topic of history. The antichrist question raised here
definitely highlights an important topic that I have not exhausted with respect to its relation to the HHI thesis. So again Ignorantianescia, or
perhaps the not-so-Ignorantianescia, on behalf of John and myself, thank you.
To your question:
The Johannine Epistles (1 & 2): first, the traditional scholarly view holds that the Antichrist myth as a literary type in Christianity formed in
the third century CE (between 180-33). For a discussion of what background material aside from textual artifacts informs my view see:
Gregory C. Jenks, The Origins and Early Development of the Antichrist Myth, (Berlin: Walter De Gruyter & Co., 1990).
Within the NT and Sinaiticus, the term antichrist is confined to the Johannine literature that Ignorantianescia cites. On the basis of the
Johannine evidence, traditional NT textual criticism holds that the antichrist figure dates to the NT period and early. Yet close examination
of the MSS transmission allows one to trace original textual artifacts (papyri and parchments) only as far back in time as the late (very late)
antiquity or the early medieval period. Our research indicates that Sinaiticus may well prove to be the earliest textual artifact containing the
term antichrist. That it occurs in a work where the lexeme root chrest- is adjusted to read Christ- is consistent with the redactive intent of
Sinaiticus as a work that focuses Christianity on the figure Jesus Christ. That his additive inverse appears in the form of antichrist is as
symmetrical as it is theoLogical.
HHI takes the rather strict and for many inconvenient approach that a textual artifact (papyrus, parchment, inscription, etc.) be produced and
cited in order to advance a date for the use of a term or existence of a figure. Under these constraints, we have no physical textual artifacts
containing the actual and complete passages in question (1 &2 John) that are dated earlier than the fourth century CE. Relying on the rule
of using only a physical text as a true and proper object of dating, it is not possible to establish an accurate date for these Johannine
Epistles earlier than their presence in perhaps Sinaiticus itself. Unfortunately, we have not yet recovered textual artifacts from the first three
centuries CE for 1 & 2 John. (I will discuss Uncial 0232 below).

If you have read through some of the HHI site, you are aware of our view of the very fascinating and valuable artifact P52.
Textual criticism is used to extrapolate assumed earlier versions of these narratives into the first century CE. At this juncture, the existence
of canonical 1 & 2 John, in the first and second century CE is really a question of faith and not science. When some present Early
Christian Writings as evidence for pre-4th century CE source material for Christianity, they often fail to examine the scholarly apparatus
within the links to expert secondary sources wherein a scholar discusses the issues of the manuscript transmission for the documents. In
the majority of cases, the oldest complete or nearly complete physical textual artifact in the form of a MS dates into the early medieval
period and no earlier. In several fortunate and remarkable cases, we have papyri fragments or parchment bits attesting to early Christian
writings; however, none of these artifacts is securely dated to the early centuries of Christianity.
Assuming for the sake of argument that traditional timeline holds there are points to be studied: there is a silence in the traditional record
between the appearance of the term antichrist in Johannine documents and those next occurrences usually cited in Irenaeus – traditionally
a century later. The only possible exception to this that comes to mind is Polycarp (Phil. 7:1, but here again it is a Johannine Epistle being
cited). Origen cites the lexeme explicitly in Cels.VI. 45. however, we have a major and familiar problem in that all the physical mss.
artifacts terminate at the transition from late antiquity to that of the early medieval: Harnack debunked some very hopeful-looking Irenaeus
material and most of what we know of this figure is highly dependent on Eusebius. We do have P. Oxyrhynchus 405, identified as fragments
of a letter by Irenaeus and dated paleographically to a range between middle 3rd–and very-late 2nd-century CE, and the scholarship seems
to follow Greenfell and Hunt. However, P. Oxyrh. 405 records neither Christ nor Antichrist and the matter rests with respect to the present
discussion. By way of aside, papyri fragments such as these are of the highest importance in resolving the issues HHI presents to the
public: these are artifacts, they hold text related to the problem, and there exists the possibility that they may be recovered from secure
contexts and strata. Unfortunately, because these best potential witnesses are fragments in most cases without clear provenance, we have
no opportunity to weigh the scale of difference between these papyri artifacts and the medieval mss purportedly containing accurate copies
of the earlier material.
We have but two early Eusebius HE mss and they date to the 5th and 6th century CE. Siglum B, Russia: St. Petersburg, Public Library,
appears to have an actual denoted date within the text equating to 462 CE. All other variants of the HE are medieval, profoundly medieval.
What we know of Polycarp derives from Greek mss. sigla b, p, s, and v. These are all of 10th and 11th century CE provenance.
Paleographers and textual critics extrapolate non-existent earlier variants dating to the 4th century CE. This leaves us with Origen. As far
as I am aware, all of the mss. of Contra Celsum derive from a single parent ms: Apostolica. Codex Vaticanus Graecus 386. This ms dates
to the 13th century C.E.
The art of textual criticism, however noble and necessary, is yet an art and not yet a science.
The More or Less Hard Evidence
As far as I am aware, outside of Sinaiticus, the earliest artifact for 1 & 2 John is Uncial 0232. The MSS is dated paleographically to the 5th
or 6th century C.E. This may be dispensed with as suitably late to precede the chrest form. That leaves only Sinaiticus itself as an artifact
attesting the lexeme antichrist. The question then rests on the date of manufacture for the Johannine material in the codex itself. The best
paleographical arguments date the codex between the first quarter of the fourth century CE and about 360 CE (as you already well know). I
do not have an image for uncial 0232 and we are not yet able to see if the ms reads antichrest/christ - but this does not, to my mind,
change our position given the late date of uncial 0232 and the consensus date for Sinaiticus.
Sinaiticus scribes A, B, & D are working late by traditional reckoning on standardizing a biblical text. Dirk Jongkind, who writes on
Sinaiticus fairly recently, gives this summary on the subject of iotacisms or itacisms:
"Our short study has broadly confirmed the remarks of Milne and Skeat on orthographic errors. We have sought to quantify the exact
differences between the three scribes. The characteristic patterns turned out to be less stable than one would have expected [and why is
that?]. In Matthew, scribe A shows a remarkable deterioration over the length of two quires. What exactly caused this change remains
unclear. Scribes A and B make the error of substituting the longer for the shorter form more often than the reverse for the the I – EI and E
AI pair. Though scribe D also does this, he does so to a lesser degree. His number of changes of EI for I is higher than for the other
scribes. However, overall, he has the least number of examples of orthographic errors in his work." (Jongkind, Dirk (2007). Scribal Habits of
Codex Sinaiticus, Gorgias Press LLC, p. 94).
Traditional scholarship peddles the thesis very successfully that the hallmark of evolution from written ancient to written Modern Greek is the
convergence of vowels and diphthongs. The circumstances surrounding the copying and compiling of Sinaiticus appears appears to indicate
Scribes A and D were copying MSS wherein there were divergent handling of eta and iota. The mistake is to limit the discussion to
itacisms. I am compelled to remark that the scribe who appears to be the overall adjuster of text, scribe D, executes the least number of
errors and undertakes the highest number eta to iota changes. One may advance the usual itacism theory and rest smug next to the
academic fire. However, itacisms do not explain the adjustment of eta to iota where there is no diphthong within the lexeme as we find in
Chrest-/Christ-. Scribe D (or some other skilled redactor) intentionally substitutes one monothong for another. One may not argue that the
scribe is making room to squeeze text into a quire for in several examples we have put forward no space is saved. We are free advance the
hypothesis that a difference or change in original meaning is to be affected. There are opposing points of view, however, this is our position.
Therefore, since we present evidence of chrestians, we seek to determine who and what this class represents historically and how this
class appears in the archaeological record.

1 & 2 John: based on an artifact approach to the NT, the trend is to date these mss late. these are evolving into products of late-antiquity
or the early medieval. I believe uncial 0232 was found at Antinopolis and there is some disagreement concerning dates with the usual
pressure to date early. Whereas earlier paleographers assigned a date of 3rd-4th century CE, the INTF (Institut für neutestamentliche
Textforschung) now assigns the 5th-6th century CE date. No one yet desires to confront in writing what the revised dates for uncial 0232
may indicate for Sinaiticus composed beyond the reign of Constantine.
The lexeme antichrist is found in Sinaiticus only in 1 & 2 John so far as I am aware. The earliest independent artifact attesting to 1 & 2
John outside of Sinaticus is the 5th-6th century uncial 0232. We assert Christ is a late form and the appearance of Antichrist should
parallel this late appearance. By our method the attested range that results is therefore fourth to sixth century CE.
There is some question regarding the appearance of the lexeme antichrist in Jewish literature (the anti-messiah of Daniel). There is also the
long lexical history of the antibasileus. However, this is beyond the scope of this discussion for the moment.
One point John & I want to make very, very, clear: HHI does not argue that I S never existed. HHI argues that Christianity centered on a
Jesus Christ as described in the canonical NT did not exist in an incontestable form until at least the 4th century CE. HHI asserts that
there is a precursor to this Orthodox Christianity. For the moment, we denote this collection of beliefs and practices as chrestiantiy and its
followers chrestians. There is something within the archaeological textual record that is as beautiful and magnificent as it is tantalizing and
elusive. John and I fully expect that papyri and parchments related to chrestianity, as well as other classes of artifacts, dating to centuries
earlier than the fourth CE, to come to light. However, HHI challenges the archaeological community to put forward hard evidence for a
Christianity centered on Jesus Christ prior to this fourth century divide.
In summary, you asked the question: why would followers of Chrest, let us call them Chrestians for the moment, fear an Antichrist and not
an Antichrest?
I will play along in the spirit of the season and say that I am not sure chrestians would fear an Antichrist any more so than they would love a
Jesus Christ. I say this because at this stage, I am not certain the two groups (4th century Christians and chrestians) are, strictly speaking,
contemporaneous, geographically contiguous with each other, or equal in terms of political power within the Roman Empire during the time
traditionally assigned for the writing of Sinaiticus.
I hope I convey a bit of the sense of wonder and humility with which I approach this complex problem and trust that, while hardly definitive,
this answer will be seen as an honest and serious attempt to treat your interesting question.
Very Kind Regards and Best Wishes this Holiday Season - David

By John, on September 3rd, 2010
The naming of the Saxon Shore with its associated fortifications is an example of how archaeology is ignored when it does not fit the historical framework. My first 'own' dig was in one of these forts during the autumn of 1968, when I was a mere lad and chosen for that very reason so as to not scare the landowning farmer into worrying about the site becoming 'protected'. How the Romans needed massive walls against 'barbarian' sea-raiders puzzled me then and such major features puzzle historians still.
The nine British Saxon Shore forts in the NoWiWia DigniWaWXm. This source is usually considered to be up to date for the Western empire in the 420s.
The term 'Saxon Shore' comes directly from the Roman document in which it is first mentioned, the Notitia Dignitatum dated to the fifth century, which lists the names of the Saxon Shore forts from Norfolk to Hampshire that were under the command of the CRXQW RI WKH SD[RQ SKRUH IRU BULWDLQ (Latin: comes litoris Sa[onici per Britanniam).
The post was created possibly during the reign of Constantine I and was probably existent by 367, when a series of invasions from Picts, Franks, Saxons, Scots and Attacotti appears to have defeated the army of Britain and resulted in the death of Nectaridus, the then office holder. This attack is known as the GUHDW CRQVSLUDF\, a year-long war described by APPLDQXV MDUFHOOLQXV as a barbarica conspiratio that capitalised on a depleted military force in the province brought about by Magnentius' losses of the Battle of Mursa Major after his unsuccessful bid to become emperor.
Further stations up the North Sea coast were probably also the responsibility of the Count. Forces he controlled were classified as limitanei, or frontier troops. By the end of the fourth century the role of Count had been diminished and Gaul had its own du[ tractus Amoricani and du[ Belgicae Secundae.

The complete fortification system of the Saxon Shore extended on both sides of the Channel.
The term 'Saxon Shore' is therefore of the late 4th century, referring to the system of defence and the office holder. Historians, though, use the term to refer to the individual fortifications, as in Saxon Shore forts. The nine forts mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum for Britain, listed from north to south, with their garrisons:
1. Branodunum (Brancaster, Norfolk). One of the earliest forts, dated to the 230s, built to guard the Wash approaches and is of a
typical rectangular castrum layout. 1 It was garrisoned by the Equites Dalmatae Brandodunenses, although evidence exists
suggesting that its original garrison was the FRKRUV I ATXLWDQRUXP. 2
2. Gariannonum (Burgh Castle, Norfolk). Established between 260 and the mid-270s to guard the River Yare (Gariannus Fluvius), it was garrisoned by the Equites Stablesiani Gariannoneses.
3. Othona (Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex). Garrisoned by the Numerus Fortensium. 3
4. Regulbium (Reculver, Kent). Together with Brancaster one of the earliest forts, built in the 210s to guard the Thames estuary, it is
likewise a castrum. 4 It was garrisoned by the cohors I Baetasiorum since the 3rd century.
5. Rutupiae (Richborough, Kent), garrisoned by parts of the Legio II Augusta.
6. Dubris (Dover Castle, Kent), garrisoned by the Milites Tungrecani.
7. Portus Lemanis (Lympne, Kent), garrisoned by the Numerus Turnacensium.
8. Anderitum (Pevensey Castle, East Sussex), garrisoned by the Numerus Abulcorum.
9. Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle, Hampshire), garrisoned by a Numerus Exploratorum.
These garrisons are those referred to in the Notitia Dignitatum – and therefore do not refer to whatever units were stationed in the forts before the late fourth century.
Some of these units, such as the Numerus Fortensium ("The Company of Brave Men") at Othona, are known to us through the Notitia Dignitatum only and therefore it cannot be assumed that these same units were the garrison units in earlier times. The archaeological evidence found by this writer at Othona was for Syrian cavalry.
At the time the earlier forts were built, their garrisons are typical of the units stationed in Britain.
The Equites Dalmatae Branodunenses, Branoduno (Brancaster) + cohors Prima Aquitanorum and the Equites Stablesiani Gariannonenses, Gariannonor. (Burgh Castle)
Units of Dalmatian cavalry were, we are specifically told by the Byzantine writer Cedrenus (Bonn edition I, 454) first raised by Gallienus (260-68). They also played a distinguished part in Claudius’ wars against the Goths (S.H.A. Claudius 11.19). A unit of Dalmatian cavalry could therefore have come to Britain at any time after the recovery of the island with the rest of the Gallic Empire on the defeat of Tetricus in 274 but not before. This might be thought to cause difficulties for those who,

like the present writer, would see in Brancaster a fort that is typologically among the earliest of the Shore forts, with rounded corners, internal bank, and no external bastions. This difficulty is, however, resolved by the recent find of a tile stamp of Cohors I Aquitanorum just outside the Shore fort, since this unit can now be regarded as the original garrison (Britannia 6 (1975), ‘Roman Britain in 1974’, part II, inscriptions no. 25). Cohors I Aquitanorum has been previously attested at Carrawburgh on Hadrian’s Wall under Hadrian (RIB 1550), and at Brough-on-Noe under Antoninus Pius (RIB 283), and there is no evidence as yet that it was ever stationed at a site in the Wall hinterland with easy access to the east coast. The point is important because it is just conceivable that the tile came to Brancaster as ship’s ballast in the same way that a tile of Legio VI Victri[ P.F. found at Gayton Thorpe, Norfolk, must almost certainly have come from York (JRS 47 (1957), 233). Professor J M C Toynbee (1962) has linked the Dalmatian cavalry at Brancaster with parts of two fine cavalry helmets found in the river Wensum which she dates stylistically to the 3rd century, a date which receives support from the recent study by Russell Robinson of Roman armour (1975). - TKH KLVWRULFDO EDFNJURXQG DQG PLOLWDU\ XQLWV RI WKH SD[RQ SKRUH by M W C Hassall
Units are drawn from across the empire, as had become the norm, to avoid a conflict of local loyalties.
At Regulbium (Reculver), the '1VW CRKRUW RI BDHWDVLDQV, FLWL]HQV RI RRPH', is an auxiliary Cohort of 500 Infantry recruited from the Baetasii who occupied the Rhineland near the Legionary fortress of Neuss. At around 139, they garrisoned the fort at Old Kilpatrick, being moved to Maryport at around 160. Their last known base was that of Reculver, shown in the Notitia Dignitatum. They are also attested at Manchester, with no certain date.
The building of forts in the early and mid-third century rules out completely all of the main hypotheses for their origin:
a shore attacked by Saxons;
a shore settled by Saxons;
to guard against an attempt at reconquest by the empire during the CDUDXVLDQ RHYROW) in 289-296.
The system of defence that we see in the late-fourth century used components of earlier times which are in no manner associated with Saxons. Reculver for example, built ca. 210, predates all these threats by a very wide margin. The term 'Saxon Shore fort' is therefore applicable only to the system of defence of that late period and should not be used to describe the original purpose of all the fortifications.
The Wash-Solent limes – the Roman name if a name existed is unknown – is a unified system performing the same duty as the limes of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius in the north, with the coast itself serving the same function as a wall. Roman limes are frontier barriers and not solely, or even primarily – defensive.
Because the garrisoned troops controlled the wall completely, the control of the influx of provincials and trade with those beyond the wall could continue without difficulty from the tribes north or south of the wall. It obviously functioned as a permanent border and was designated the immovable border of the Roman Empire.
The large forts, no matter the size and shape, all contained certain structures that reinforced their Roman nature. They helped with the Romanization of the Britons by bringing peace and trade to the north, bringing religions from the Roman world, and synthesizing the gods of the Britons and Rome. In addition these forts imposed the Roman militaristic administration.
Other Romanization that the wall brought was the increase in trade within the province and production of Roman goods. With the incursions from the north halted, Roman traders could move more freely through the province, and the Britons began to create Roman goods for trade within the province and trade with other provinces. The Britons had access to Roman amenities that surrounded the forts, such as the baths, brothels, drink shops, and food shops. - Hadrian's Wall: Romanization on Rome's Northern Frontier by Joshua P. Haskett (December 2009)
Sea trade along the coast of Roman Britain was an important economic activity. 5 Goods from continental Europe were imported and shipped north. British produce was shipped south.
The military campaigns in the north 6 during the early-third century made huge logistical demands, met largely by sea transport along the east coast.

Remains of Reculver Church viewed from the west, September 2005 A church was built on the same site as the Roman fort in about 669, when King Ecgberht of Kent granted land for the foundation of a monastery there. The remains of the fort, the Saxon church and the twin towers are a Scheduled Ancient Monument run by English Heritage.
The founding date of RHFXOYHU (early third century) matches the campaigns of Severus and his son, Caracalla.
Eboracum (York) became a thriving port, handling olive oil, wine, red Samian ware from Gaul, fine tableware from Germany and supplies of grain, pottery and horses for the army. Roman tombstones show the cosmopolitan nature of the city with merchants from Gaul, Sardinia and elsewhere. Emperor Septimius Severus visited Eboracum in 211 and made it his base for campaigning in Scotland. Around 200, it had been made the capital of Britannia Inferior (Upper Britain) – and therefore seat of the governor or praeses – when Britain had been divided into two provinces; and it was probably during Severus' time in the city that York was given the status of a Colonia.
The fort of Reculver stood directly at the northern entrance of the mile-wide Wantsum Channel, which separated Thanet island from the mainland. The Channel was a favoured passage for shipping, and the fort was built to both control it and act as a navigational marker. The fort itself was a typical castrum, square-shaped with rounded corners. The single rampart was 10 feet (3 m) thick at the base and tapering to 8 feet (2.5m) at the top, with a height of probably 20 feet (6 m). It was additionally strengthened by an earthen rampart in the interior, and surrounded by two external ditches.

The Reculver Inscription, recording the building of the principia of the fort. Found in 1960 by A. O. Lewington of the Reculver Excavation Group, in the cellared strongroom of the principia, the inscription must have been placed on the wall of the sacellum above.
Left: Remains of the rampart of Regulbium. The typical Roman mixture of stone and bricks is evident.
About three-quarters of the Reculver Inscription are recovered, in 11 fragments and a reconstruction with translation was made by the late Professor Sir Alan
Richmond 7.
It seems that the shrine of the standards (AEDEM) of the headquarters (PRINCIPIORVM) together with (CVM) the crosshall (BASILICA) were built under (SVB) the consular governor (COS), A. TRIARIVS RVFINVS. The work was carried out by FORTVNATVS who was probably the commander of the fort. Triarius Rufinus was consul at Rome in AD 210 and Professor Richmond suggested that he probably became governor of Britain in about 210-216.
This dating coincides with other archaeological evidence 8.
The Q. ARADIVS RVFINVS has been identified by R.P. Harper 9 as Quintus Aradius Rufinus, the consular governor of the inscription, in office in the mid 220s.
Professor Richmond also added about the inscription:
"epigraphically, its importance lies in the fact that this is the first time the inscribed phrase aedes principiorum can be applied to and identified with the official shrine of the headquarters buildings, hitherto unmentioned in any inscription. It is also the first certain instance of the application of the name basilica to a military crosshall, although the resemblance between these buildings and a civil basilica has often been stressed." So, too, does it add another name (RVFINVS) "to the meagre list of third century consular governors."
Another Rufinus – Aulus Triarius Rufinus – held the consulship in 210. Rufinus was a Roman name given to several figures:
- Rufinus a governor of Roman Britain in the early 3rd century who may be the same man as one of the two consuls.
- Rufinus a chief minister for two Eastern Roman emperors, Theodosius I and Arcadius in the late 4th century.
- Tyrannius Rufinus, a monk of the later 4th century
- SDLQWV RXILQXV, eleven saints named Rufinus in Roman Martyrology, including
- Rufinus of Assisi, 3rd century and first (legendary) bishop of Assisi and martyr. His remains were put to rest in a Roman sarcophagus. The front is sculpted in low relief with the myth of Selene and Endymion. It is now located under the main altar of the Cathedral of San Rufino, which is the third church to have been erected over his remains.

We now have a new addition to the Roman limes.
The ‘Roman Limes’ represents the border line of the Roman Empire at its greatest extent in the 2nd century. It stretched over
5,000 km from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across
North Africa to the Atlantic coast.

The Limes Romanus
The word limes (plural: limites) was utilised by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier. This latter sense has been
adapted and extended by modern historians concerned with the frontiers of the Roman Empire; e.g., Hadrian's wall in the north of
England is sometimes styled the Limes Britannicus, the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia facing the desert is called the
Limes Arabicus, and so forth.
<img border="0" height="606" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Portchester_castle_02.jpg"
width="800">
Portus Adurni - Porchester castle - the best preserved Roman fort north of the Alps, occupies a commanding position at the head
of Portsmouth Harbour.
The fort was built during the 3rd century, predating any Saxon threat by at least a century.
The fort is square, enclosing an area of 9 acres (36,000 mð) with outer walls 20 feet (6 m) high, 10 feet (3 m) thick and 210 yards
(200 m) long.
The most notable examples of Roman limites or limes are:
<ul> <li>
Hadrian's Wall - Limes Britannicus
</li> <li>
Antonine Wall - in Scotland
</li> <li>
Limes Germanicus, the Germanic & Raetian Limes
</li> <li>
Limes Arabicus, the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea facing the desert
</li> <li>
Limes Tripolitanus, the frontier in modern Libya facing the Sahara
</li> <li>
Trajan's Wall, the frontier in Moesia Inferior (currently in Bessarabia and Dobrudja)
</li> <li>
Limes Transalutanus, the frontier in the lower Danube
</li> <li>
Limes Moesiae, the frontier in eastern Romania and Moldavia

We can now see how these limes were part of the process of Romanisation. What I find interesting is that as Rome adopted
much of Greek culture, so the empire became part of the panhellenic world, as described here.

Chrestian theology and texts - Origins of Christianity

Introduction
Though religions like to claim divine revelation, so that a new theology appears immediately - god given reality is slower, because theologies, religions, their places of worship, liturgies and their congregations are all the work of Man. Christianity may have been made in one, tremendous heave, but this was by people, centuries later than its textual tradition claims and the building blocks had long been in place: the Religio Romana and imperial cult of Ancient Rome, imperial history and institutions, buildings (the Curia and many basilicas, pre-Christian - Chrestian - churches, baptisteries and many sainted chapels), even many of the priestly functions.
Christian theology didn't slowly evolve, as its textual tradition suggests, but like the Roman Church, was built from numerous and existing parts:
Claimed first-hand accounts of its principal, divine man: gospels and letters (epistles). Luke/Acts and the 'Pauline' letters. Revelation
The Shepherd of Hermas
Though much of the New Testament is drawn on Josephus, modern scholar largely accept how these chronicles (extant copies are all very late) have been altered by Christians, especially as regards Christianity. The passage below has certainly had Jesus Christ added to it (the whole marked thusly):
Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some of his companions; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest. (Josephus, The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX, Ch. 9, Concerning Albinus under whose procuratorship James was slain; as also what edifices were built by Agrippa.)
This also underlines how the sanhedrin was not free from outside control, whether Herodian, Chrestian, or Roman.
The Shepherd of Hermas
The appearance of Grapte in The Shepherd of Hermas suggests - as she is a member of the royal family in Adiabene and thus related to "Helen" and "Izates" - that this books belong to a separate tradition which fell out of favour. Perhaps this is why the book was omitted from the later New Testament.



Grapte is 1st century - the Grapte Palace was a noted landmark close by the (Second) Temple during the 1st Jewish-Roman War.
4[8]:3 Thou shalt therefore write two little books, and shalt send one to Clement, and one to Grapte. So Clement shall send to the foreign cities, for this is his duty; while Grapte shall instruct the widows and the orphans. But thou shalt read (the book) to this city along with the elders that preside over the Church.
- The Shepherd of Hermas



This belongs therefore to a tradition associated with Adiabene and the conversion to Judaism of its royal family (and maybe most of its nobility), originating in either the first or early-second century. By the end of the 2nd century, Izates has become divine in the kingdom of Araba (not Arabia) in Mesopotamia/east Syria.
The royal tombs created by Helen at Jerusalem (the rolling stone, right) are remarkably similar to that provided for the corpse of 'Jesus' by "Joseph of Arimathea". The character of this "Joseph"and the tomb are provided to fulfill this prophecy: Then they made his grave with the wicked, and with rich people his tomb - although he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. (The Qumran community's Great Isaiah Scroll)
Left: "King 'tlw of Adiabene", found in Hatra. Interpreted by the archaeologists as Izates in divine form; late 2nd century.
Right: two images - (i) Izates in a rock relief at Batas, Iraq; (ii) Azes in Indo-Scythian coin of early 1st century. Izates was also called "Izas" by Josephus and here, we suggest "Izas" is Azes. Here, they both adopt the pose of Zeus, with his staff.
Both the New Testament and other texts of the same, or earlier period contain severe parodies of Helen of Adiabene: this queen was and is highly regarded in Judaism, so she and her son clearly had a great, negative impact on the (Chrestian) authors.
Revelation
This belongs to the Chrestian tradition, in particular the Church set up by Saul in the 1st century. As with Saul:



...the author never states that he knew Jesus.
The seven churches:
Genre
Revelation is an apocalyptic prophecy in the form of a letter (epistle) addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia. "Apocalypse" means the revealing of divine mysteries; John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches. The entire book constitutes the letter - the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven. The book is also prophecy: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other New Testament book.
This book is a product of Greek culture:
The title is taken from the first word of the book in Koine Greek: ἀποκάλυψις apokalypsis, meaning "unveiling" or "revelation".
The Chi-Rho symbol with Alpha and Omega, Catacombs of Domitilla, Rome
As with the other books of the New Testament, it undergoes periodic revision. The Greek letters Alpha and Omega start appearing in stone artefacts, either side of the Ptolemaic Ch-Rho, in probably the late 4th century; copies of the New Testament produced after that time start to include the expression:
The term Alpha and Omega comes from the phrase "I am the alpha and the omega" (Koiné Greek: "ἐγὼ τὸ Α καὶ τὸ Ω"), an appellation of Jesus in the Book of Revelation (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13). The first part of this phrase ("I am the Alpha and Omega") is first found in Chapter 1 verse 8, and is found in every manuscript of Revelation that has 1v8. Several later manuscripts repeat "I am the Alpha and Omega" in 1v11 too, but it does not receive support here from most of the oldest manuscripts, including the Alexandrine, Sinaitic, and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus. It is, therefore, omitted in some modern translations. Scholar Robert Young stated, with regard to "I am the Alpha and Omega" in 1v11, that the "oldest [manuscripts] omit" it.
To ensure clarity: the early versions of Revelation did not contain the "Alpha to Omega" reference - it is added later, when it also appears in stone artefact associated with the adoption of the Chi-Rho by Constantine I the Great. The claimed conversion of this emperor to Christianity has no archaeological support; his declaration therefore relates to Chrestianity.
The above sequence of images illustrates how the Staff of Osiris, of the pharaonic religion in Ancient Egypt, syncretises to become symbols claimed very much later as Christian. This is how the Osiris Myth, with its resurrection in the Nile, became Ptolemaic then Chrestian, used by Hadrian to sacrifice then resurrect Antinous, then the central tenet of Christianity. The crucifix with Chrest (later, Christ) on it is, of course, suggested by the Greek symbols.
Gospels and letters
First, the problems associated with this genre need to be recognised:
They are anonymous. Though many assume who are the authors of the synoptic gospels, these assumptions are baseless. They are unprovenanced, which in archaeological terms, reduces their value very considerably (because as they did not come from secure, cultural layers, we have little or no context for them). They are not dated reliably - none, not even the codices, have been carbon dated.



As a result, where the synoptic stand in contrast to the many others is speculative.
None of the texts/fragments or early codices of the New Testament mention either "Jesus" or "Christ" explicitly.
Their use of nomima sacra instead indicates that the gospels are a product of a culture already using such symbols and this is the Ptolemaic society of Egypt (whose last monarch was Cleopatra VII).
The original Codex Sinaiticus spells Chrest and Chrestian, not Christ or Christian; the New Testament is thus based on Chrestian theology.
As noted often elsewhere in this site, the general character of the New Testament is that of a Chrestian parody of its enemy: messianic Judaism and Jews, particularly its leadership (the series of Righteous Teachers).
But when Palestine became Roman territory the cross was introduced as a form of punishment, more particularly for those who could not prove their Roman citizenship; later on it was reserved for thieves and malefactors (Josephus, Antiq., XX, vi, 2; Bell. Jud., II, xii, 6; XIV, 9; V, xi, 1). (The cross as an instrument of punishment in the ancient world, Archæology of the Cross and Crucifix)
Though crosses in various forms appear in the past and modern eras, the crucifix does not appear until it was written into the NT accounts:
During the first two centuries of Christianity, the cross may have been rare in Christian iconography, as it depicts a purposely painful and gruesome method of public execution and Christians were reluctant to use it. A symbol similar to the cross, the staurogram, was used to abbreviate the Greek word for cross in very early New Testament manuscripts such as P66, P45 and P75, almost like a nomina sacra. The extensive adoption of the cross as Christian iconographic symbol arose from the 4th
century. (History of the Cross)
That is, Chrestians of the first centuries of the modern era had no gospels and thus, neither crucifixion nor crucifix. Here is a fresco from the early-3rd century baptistery at Dura Europos:
This site is also associated with Dura parchment 24 fragment (Uncial 0212 in the Gregory-Aland numbering), also dated to the early 3rd century. Though the text mentions the impending crucifixion, none of the frescos show this. The name 'Jesus' is not spelled out either. (This fragment is the earliest claimed as Christian - for which there is a secure layer, context and date.)



Authorship
The source of the first gospel, which gave rise to the synoptic versions in the New Testament, is a product of Greek culture in the Levant sometime after Hadrian and before the 4th century (when the NT appears). The author had studied the appropriate texts (especially Josephus and Plutarch) and further, was conversant with the faith of Mesopotamia (the tradition of the sacrificial king) and the syncretic faiths (in this period) of the Levant, especially Syria. Lastly, he was motivated.
Bardaisan (Syriac: ܕ ܢ , Bardaiṣān),also known as Ibn daisan, also Latinized as Bardesanes(154–222), was a Syriac gnostic and founder of the Bardaisanites. A scientist, scholar, astrologer, philosopher and poet, Bardaisan was also renowned for his knowledge of India, on which he wrote a book, now lost...
Bardaisan (bar-Daisan meaning son of Daisan/leaping river in Aramaic ) was an Assyrian born on 11 July 154, in Edessa, which, in those days, was alternately under the influence of theRoman and the Parthian Empire. Edessa was a metropolis of Osroene. He is the creator of an offshoot of Mesopotamian religion named after his name which was the base of gnostic Mani and later gnostic Batini and Ismaili sub-sect of Shia...
...educated with the crown-prince of the Osrhoenic kingdom, at the court of Abgar VIII bar Manu.
Owing to political disturbances in Edessa, Bardaisan and his parents moved for a while to Hierapolis (Mabug), a strong centre of Babylonianism. Here the boy was brought up in the house of a priest Anuduzbar. In this school he learnt all the intricacies of Babylonian astrology...
According to tradition, during his youth he shared the education of a royal prince who afterwards became King of Edessa, perhaps Abgar X bar Manu (reigned Osroene 202-217).
Perhaps owing to the persecutions under Caracalla, Bardaisan for a time retreated into Armenia...
According to Sozomen's Ecclesiastical history, "Harmonius, his son, was deeply versed in Grecian erudition, and was the first to subdue his native tongue to meters and musical laws; these verses he delivered to the choirs".
Encounter with religious men from India
Porphyry states that on one occasion at Edessa, Bardaisan interviewed an Indian deputation of holy men (designated as Σαρμαναίοι,Sramanas) who had been sent to the Roman emperor Elagabalus or another Severan dynasty Roman Emperor, and questioned them as to the nature of Indian religion...
Bardaisan also thought the sun, moon and planets were living beings, to whom, under God, the government of this world was largely entrusted; and though man was free, he was strongly influenced for good or for evil by the constellations. Bardaisan's catechism must have been a strange mixture of Christian doctrine and references to the signs of the Zodiac. Led by the fact that "spirit" is feminine in Syriac, he seems to have held unorthodox views on the Trinity. He apparently denied the Resurrection of the Body...
Something of a polymath, he had the knowledge, skill and - because of loyalty to the king in Edessa - the motive.

This motive comes from his friend overthrowing the foreign rule which had dominated the kingdom from the early 1st century - and then having to justify this rebellion.
This kingdom was established by Nabataean or Arab tribes from North Arabia, and lasted nearly four centuries (c. 132 BC to 214), under twenty-eight rulers, who sometimes called themselves "king" on their coinage.
The history is - as we see supra - uncertain; it is also shrouded in legend and this legend includes two of the oldest tales from the textual tradition (i.e. mythology adopted by Christianity):
.
Right: Fresco from Varaga St. Gevorg church chapel showing king Abgar with image of Christ.
The legend tells that Abgar, king of Edessa, afflicted with an incurable sickness, probably leprosy, had heard the fame of the power and miracles of Jesus and wrote to him, acknowledging his divinity, craving his help, and offering him asylum in his own residence; the tradition states that Jesus wrote a letter, commending Abgar on his faith, but declining to go, but promising that after his ascension, he would send one of his disciples, endowed with his power...
The correspondence consisted of Abgar's letter and the answer dictated by Jesus. As the legend later expanded, a portrait of Jesus painted from life began to be mentioned.
Without a historical Jesus Christ and in the character of the anti-messianic textual tradition of Chrestianity, this correspondence has a very different provenance, the one letter found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, described by Eisenman as "MMT as a Jamesian letter to 'The Great King of the Peoples Across the Euphrates'."



Fragments of the 4QMMT roll, found in Cave 4 at Qumran on six fragmented manuscripts (4Q394, 4Q395, 4Q396, 4Q397, 4Q398, 4Q399). The third section is addressed to a respected individual, whose honesty and integrity are acknowledged by the author, encouraging him to study carefully 'the book of Moses and the books of the Prophets and David.' He also refers to the blessings and curses on the Israelite kings and asks the recipient to remember their actions, giving the impression that the recipient may himself be a Jewish monarch.
4QMMT
This is a letter from James, the Righteous Teacher at Qumran, to the king ruling northern Mesopotamia Edessa, Hatra and Adiabene. A purchaser of a franchise today would recognise it as a set of guidelines instructions even - on how to be a good manager; in this case, rule as a good, observant Jew.
[In Galatians] Paul is objecting precisely to the sort of understanding and attitude we find expressed in 4QMMT. MMT, in common with other strands of Second Temple Judaism, understood “righteousness” and “justification” in relation to and as somehow dependent on hrwth yf[m/e;rga no,mou. ...In direct opposition, Paul insisted that pi,stij VIhsou/ Cristou/ alone was sufficient, precisely as “faith in Jesus Christ” and not as “faithfulness” to rules and practices which required separation from the unfaithful, of Jew from Gentile. (James D. G. Dunn, "4QMMT and Galatians," New Testament Studies 43 (1997): 151)
And which king had famously converted to Judaism at this time? Izates/Izas, son of "Helen" of Adiabene.
The “Letter” would then be - to conflate the notices about “Letter’ or “Letters” in all our sources - a variation on the one James sent down via “Judas Barsabas” ( a.k.a. Judas the brother of James, a.k.a. Judas the Zealot, a.k.a Judas Thomas, a.k,a. Thaddaeus, a.k.a. Lebbaeus - and a.k,a., possibly, “Judas Iscariot” ) to “Antioch” with his rulings appertaining to overseas communities, even according to Acts’ somewhat tendentious presentation. In other words, what we have in this Qumran archive, are copies of the actual letter, brought down by Judas, James’ brother, to the “King” of the Edessenes or Adiabene -- which is unimportant.
This is the ruler, playfully misnamed by Josephus as Izates and Izas:
Abgar V the Black or Abgarus V of Edessa (Syriac: ܐ ܐܘ ; ʾAḇgar
Ḥəmīšāyā ʾUkkāmā, Armenian: Աբգար Ե; Abgar E, Ancient Greek: Ἄβγαρος Abgaros) BC 4 – AD 7 and AD 13–50) was an historical Syriac ruler of the kingdom of Osroene, holding his capital at Edessa.
And this is the problem for Bardaisan, wanting to justify his friend taking over the rule there in the late second century: to him, the lineage of the rulers from the early-first century until his time are invalid, which means a 'mistake' was made at the start of the dynasty in the first century.
Bardaisan's explanation for this purported error he reveals in the trial of the divine man: he has two of the same name, one being:
Bardaisan lets the insurrectionist go free, because he - Abgar/Izates - takes over Edessa. The divine man is crucified as 'king of the Jews' because Bardaisan regards this man as the rightful king dispossed. All this theological myth-making for such a small matter - rule of a small state few know and nobody cares about.



The political mistake Bardaisan and the king make is in attaching blame to imperial Roman authority Pilate - and the Herodian Sanhedrin. The result is that he goes on the run from Severan authority, though the ending is inevitable: the king is invited to Rome and killed, Bardaisan disappears and Rome takes over the kingdom.
That could have ended the story, but (a) Izates is a hero-cult figure in Northern Mesopotamia and by the end of the second century is put on a pedestal as a divine man, and (b) the Chrestian Church is growing nearby, in Asia Minor. He appears in Luke/Acts:
One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) (Acts 11:28)
Where did Luke find his raw material for the prophecy of Agabus of a great famine to transpire in Claudius' reign, of Paul's trip from Antioch to deliver famine relief funds to Jerusalem, and for the earlier tale of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch? Again, from Josephus (though perhaps also from other cognate sources of information). It all stems, by hook and by crook, from the story of Helen, Queen of Adiabene, a realm contiguous and/or overlapping with Edessa, whose king Agbar/Abgarus some sources make Helen's husband. (Robert Eiseman's JAMES THE BROTHER OF JESUS: A Higher-Critical Evaluation by Robert M. Price)
Bardaisan, as source Q, has concerns very different from the Chrestian seven churches in which the divine man is Saul resurrected as Paul. Bardaisan has his divine man perform miracles and make prophecies, while the early Chrestian textual tradition Paul make the magic. Only in the New Testament are the two brought together and this was an imperial production. At this time, books needed imperial approval, as did residence of philosophers in cities, entry to the royal library in Alexandria and the work of oracles; the imperial secret service ensured this:
The Roman Empire possessed a fondness for the practice of political espionage. Spies engaged in both foreign and domestic political operations, gauging the political climate of the Empire and surrounding lands by eavesdropping in the Forum or in public market spaces. Several ancient accounts, especially those of the A.D. first century, mention the presence of a secret police force, the frumentarii . By the third century, Roman authors noted the pervasiveness and excessive censorship of the secret police forces, likening them to an authoritative force or an occupational army. Political espionage was not limited to the more contentious parts of the Roman periphery, but was also practiced in Rome itself by rival factions of the government. Some ministries even employed saboteurs. Concern about government rivalries necessitated the creation of the agentes in rebus, the first exclusive counterintelligence force. (Espionage and Intelligence, Early Historical Foundations)
There was no opportunity for 'Christian' books to be written, published and distributed across the empire in the early centuries without first gaining imperial authority.
The frumentarii quickly earned the hatred of society. In the 3rd century, association with the heads of the service could produce severe repercussions. In 217, Macrinus appointed Marcus Oclatinus Adventus, the former head of the frumentarii and the prefect of the Praetorian Guard, to the Senate. With one decision, Macrinus alienated most of the Roman establishment and made his own political destruction inevitable—so much were the frumentarii resented. Diocletian terminated the frumentarii because of their abuses and loathsome reputation. The emperor's decision netted him great popularity, but a short time later the equally sinister and far better organized agentes in rebus were created in its stead.
Jamesian Letter
There is another letter supposedly by James - the Epistle of James in the New Testament:
There are four views concerning the Epistle of James:
1. that the letter was written by James before the Pauline Epistles, 2. that the letter was written by James after the Pauline Epistles, 3. that the letter is pseudonymous, 4. that the letter comprises material originally from James but reworked by a later editor.
The NT authors could have composed letters from any apostle, so that they put in one purportedly by the historical James suggests they knew of the real letter (supra) and as so often turned history into parody. The best alternative is that they somehow found another real letter and altered it to what they wanted.
James is neither Chrestian, nor Christian; he is an observant, messianic Jew until killed in 62. At that time, he was the Righteous Teacher:



The Teacher of Righteousness (in Hebrew: מורה הצדק Moreh ha-Tzedek) is a figure found in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran, most prominently in the Damascus Document. [1]
This document speaks briefly of the origins of the sect, probably Essenes, 390 years after the Babylonian exile and after 20 years of 'groping' blindly for the way. "God... raised
for them a Teacher of Righteousness to guide them in the way of His heart".
[2]
The Teacher is extolled as having proper understanding of the Torah, qualified in its
accurate instruction,
[3]
and being the one through whom God would reveal to the
community “the hidden things in which Israel had gone astray”.
[4]
The Pauline corpus
There is no reason to doubt how the historical Saul corresponded as he travelled to create his gentile, Chrestian Church. Some of the letters appearing in the NT are dismissed by modern scholarship as fakes:
The Epistle to the Hebrews, although it does not bear his name, was traditionally considered Pauline for a thousand years, but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it doesn't read like any of his other epistles in style and content.
That leaves just seven:
First Thessalonians (ca. 51 AD) Philippians (ca. 52–54 AD) Philemon (ca. 52–54 AD) First Corinthians (ca. 53–54 AD) Galatians (ca. 55 AD) Second Corinthians (ca. 55–56 AD) Romans (ca. 55–58 AD)
They could be at least based on genuine letters by Saul. The people in them match the character of Chrestians in that period. The problem arises of how they could have been collected, preserved and then found centuries later; the best answer to this comes from recognition of his role as spy and agent provocateur for the Herodian monarchy - they were archived either by Herodians or imperial Rome (Epaphroditus).
As the later divine man, Paul performed magic such as exorcisms and prophecy. He has also been identified as Simon Magus:
Josephus mentions a magician named Atomus (Simon in Latin manuscripts)
[8]
as being involved with the procurator Felix, King Agrippa II and his sister Drusilla, where Felix has Simon convince Drusilla to marry him instead of the man she was engaged to. Some
scholars have considered the two to be identical,
[9]
although this is not generally accepted, as the Simon of Josephus is a Jew rather than a Samaritan.
Also: What about the always fascinating character Simon Magus? Eisenman identifies him with a magician named Simon of whom Josephus recounts that he helped Bernice convince her sister Drusilla to dump her husband King Azizus of Emesa, who had gotten circumcised to marry her, so she could take up with the uncircumcised Felix instead. Josephus' magician Simon is a Cypriot, while Acts' Simon Magus is said by later writers to hale from Gitta in Samaria, but this actually strengthens the connection, since it was natural to confuse "Gitta" with the "Kittim," or Sea Peoples of Cyprus. Not only so, but Eisenman notes that some manuscripts of Josephus name the magician "Atomus," which Eisenman connects with the Primal Adam doctrine he sees implied in Simon's claims to have been the Standing One reincarnated many times. But there is a closer link still, that Eisenman chanced not to note. Anyone can see that Luke has created the episode of Saul/Paul squaring off against Elymas the sorcerer (Acts 13:8 ff) as a Pauline counterpoint to Peter's contest with Simon Magus in Acts 8:9 ff (in fact, Elymas' patronymic "bar-Jesus" as likely as not reflects the claim Simon made to have recently appeared in Judea as Jesus). So Elymas is simply Simon Magus. And, what do you know?, the Western Text of Acts gives the name as Etoimas or Etomas instead of Elymas! Thus, Simon Magus = Elymas = Etomas = Atomus = Josephus' Simon = Simon Magus. (Robert Eisenman's JAMES THE BROTHER OF JESUS: A Higher-Critical Evaluation by Robert M. Price)
A serious problem for the absolute authenticity of these letters is that in Saul's time, there was no 'Jesus Christ' and Saul hated, rather than worshipped the Righteous Teacher James; Paul is Saul in divine



form, performing the Greek Magic later attributed to 'Jesus'; he had no need for another leader, especially not another divine man - he, Saul/Paul - was it, the founder of a new, Chrestian Church.
16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of IS CHREST to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
- Acts 16
Hail God of Abraham Hail God of Isaac Hail God of Jacob; Jesus Chrestos the Holy Spirit the Son of the Father who is above the Seven who is within the Seven. Bring Iao Sabaoth may your power issue forth from him NN until you drive away this unclean daimon Satan who is in him.
So even if some of the Pauline corpus was originally authentic, by the time it was added to the New Testament, these letters had been heavily revised to match the new, imperial theme.
Present understanding

This is the new faith of the Ptolemaic elite in Alexandria. Few scholars have studied this subject, nor how it impacted Rome, its first emperor and the Roman elite; Egyptian-style temples in Italy, for example, tend to be treated in isolation.
The term "life-death-rebirth deity" is associated with the works of James Frazer, Jane Ellen Harrison, and their fellow Cambridge Ritualists. In their seminal works The Golden
Bough and Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, Frazer and Harrison argued that all myths are echoes of rituals, and that all rituals have as their primordial purpose the



manipulation of natural phenomena by means of sympathetic magic. Some scholars, beginning with Franz Cumont, classify Jesus as a syncretized example of this archetype. (Osiris-Dionysus, Princeton University)
The Osiris-Dionysus hypothesis - or: observation of selective archaeology and their collective interpretation - undoubtedly has a lot of truth:
The earliest discussions of mythological parallels between Dionysus and the figure of the Christ in Christian theology can be traced to Friedrich Hölderlin, whose identification of Dionysus with Christ is most explicit in Brod und Wein (1800–1801) and Der Einzige (1801
1803).[59]
Theories regarding such parallels were popular in the 19th century but were later on mostly rejected by contemporary scholarship. A few modern scholars such as Martin Hengel, Barry Powell, Robert M. Price, and Peter Wick, among others, argue that Dionysian religion and Christianity have notable parallels. They point to the symbolism of wine and the importance
it held in the mythology surrounding both Dionysus and Jesus Christ;[60][61]though, Wick argues that the use of wine symbolism in the Gospel of John, including the story of the Marriage at Cana at which Jesus turns water into wine, was intended to show Jesus as
superior to Dionysus.[62]
A few scholars of comparative mythology identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying
and-returning god mythological archetype.[12] However, this identification is often seen as superficial as most such deities had a cyclical nature, as they died and were reborn each year, representing the cycle of nature, while the resurrection of Christ was a single event placed in a specific historical and geographical context. On the other hand, Dionysus lifedeath-rebirth cycle was strongly tied to the grape harvest. Moreover it has been noted that the details of Dionysus death and rebirth are starkly different both in content and symbolism from Jesus, with Dionysus being (in the most common myth) torn to pieces and eaten by
the titans and "eventually restored to a new life" from the heart that was left over.[63]
[64] Other elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have
parallels.[65] Powell, in particular, argues precursors to the Catholic notion
of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.[65] However such claims are strongly disputed as the rituals of Dionysus did not involve the transformation of the substance of bread and wine in the god himself. Rather the myth stated that Dionysus became the wine of libation, which was not drunk or consumed in any way, hence having a very different symbolism.
Another parallel can be seen in The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity which is compared to the New Testament scene of
Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate.[62][65][66]
There are three weaknesses with this:
1. As mentioned earlier (supra), Christianity is not a natural, cultural progression from an earlier stage, but an invention, a fabrication, an intellectual exercise in which elements of many other cults and religions around the empire were cherry-picked to make a new, imperial religion. 2. As with all the other histories and hypotheses, it fails to include the archaeology for Chrest. 3. Chrestianity preceded Christianity.
Without Chrest and Chrestians, there could not have been a New Testament.
Chrest
The usual understanding of the term Chrest is "good":
Strong's Concordance
chréstos: serviceable, good
Original Word: χρηστός, ή, όν Part of Speech: Adjective Transliteration: chréstos Phonetic Spelling: (khrase-tos') Short Definition: useful, gentle, pleasant, kind Definition: useful, gentle, pleasant, kind.
Thayer's Greek Lexicon



There are a few memorial inscriptions for ordinary people in the eastern Roman Empire who have the name Chrest and this fits well with the above (e.g. she was a kind, useful wife). However, the fortunetelling bowl found in Alexandria harbour, used and discarded in the early first century of the modern era, bears this title:
The Antonia Minor/Drusus/Jucundus inscriptions mentions members of a faith: Chrestiani/Chrestians; the Greek Magical Papyri has a spell invoking Jesus Chrest. Then there are the earliest codices using Chrest as a title for their divine man. The preponderance of evidence is therefore for Chrest as a title for a magician/divine man (with magic wand) and this is used centuries prior to the title becoming Christ/anointed/messiah.
The connections between Chrest/Christ and the Ankh/Tau-Rho/Chi-Rho/crucifix suggest instead a meaning belonging to the Ptolemaic faith as syncretised with the pharaonic: resurrection. This becomes reinforced with both Chrest and the Chi-Rho appearing on and in archaeology for sites and artefacts of baptism.
The gospels let us regard resurrection as a dead person being revived, to walk the Earth again, but when the pharaohs were resurrected, it was via the rituals described in the Book of the Dead and to a different world; Antinous was resurrected as a divine man in stone. Left: Osiris "The God Of The Resurrection", rising from his bier.
That the gospels paint such a different picture, of a literal resurrection of a dead body, is the nature of parody.
In the New Testament - the imperial version of late Chrestianity - Chrest has become a title appended to the forename (always abbreviated), in the Greek manner (a king of the past era did use Chrest). Many Greek kings used titles with both an ordinary, secular and theophoric manner, much to the confusion of



numismatists and historians. One example that is also used frequently in the New Testament for IS Chrest is Soter - Saviour: a title of Jesus of Nazareth, most particularly in the fish acronym. This is Ichthys:
ΙΧΘΥΣ (Ichthus) is an acronym/acrostic[4] for "Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ", (Iēsous Christos, Theou Yios, Sōtēr), which translates into English as "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour".
Using the original title, Chrest, and recognising how the abbreviated forename is never expanded or explained, we have: IS Chrest, Son of God, Saviour.
The story of Jonah and the fish in the Old Testament offers an example of typology. In the Old Testament Book of Jonah, Jonah told his shipmates to sacrifice him by throwing him overboard. Jonah explained that due to his own death, God's wrath would pass and that the sea would become calm. Subsequently Jonah then spent three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish before it spat him up onto dry land.
Typological interpretation of this story holds that it prefigures Christ's burial, the stomach of the fish representing Christ's tomb: as Jonah exited from the fish after three days and three nights, so did Christ rise from His tomb on the third day. In the New Testament, Jesus invokes Jonah in the manner of a type: "As the crowds increased, Jesus said, 'This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.'" Luke 11:29–32 (see also Matthew 12:38–42, 16:1–4)). Jonah called the belly of the fish "She'ol", the land of the dead (translated as "the grave" in the NIV Bible).
Thus whenever one finds an allusion to Jonah in Medieval art or in Medieval literature, it usually represents an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ. Other common typological allegories entail the four major Old Testament prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel prefiguring the four Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; or the twelve tribes of Israel foreshadowing the twelve apostles. Commentators could find countless numbers of analogies between stories of the Old Testament and the New; modern typologists prefer to limit themselves to considering typological relationships that they find sanctioned in the New Testament itself,
as in the example of Jonah above.[8]

Chrestians believed they had the means to ensure everlasting life and in a very pleasant place. Chrestians leaders were able to sell this promise in return for Earthly obedience.



Medallion of Constantine I the Great with Chi-Rho. From this point, the Chi-Rho began to appear across the empire, usually associated with baptism.
The strong suggestion made here, to include Chrestians, Chrestian artefacts (including the textual) and sites, in a systematic manner in the context of the early empire, produces a novel history. The novelty may be hard for some to digest and if so, that's the fault of past historians for not including it at all.
Despite sites being built over, bombed and looted, despite scholars studiously ignoring the evidences, despite many people preferring mythology to science, the facts of the matter are not going away.
Chrestianity existed for centuries and the bulk of it lives on in Christianity.

Early croziers were claimed to enable miracles, i.e. they were the magic wands of magi. The yew tree was regarded in the British Isles as sacred and many/most early churches were set next to a sacred yew.
Who would have known best what was their faith: the earliest members, or those who followed centuries later? According the the Roman Church, its founders were ignorant and partly pagan; is this accusation credible?
The original New Testament (codices Vaticanus and Sinaiticus) do not use the terms Jesus or Christ, but abbreviations and IS, and Chrest.
Much later, a book appears dated conventionally to the 6th century and claiming (with no support) to have been copied from an earlier by one Lactantius (for whom no supporting evidence exists) that the original spellings were made in ignorance. The world has come to accept both this and the new name and title: Jesus Christ.

First of all, it is befitting that we should know that His name is not known even to the angels who dwell in heaven, but to Himself only, and to God the Father; nor will that name be published, as the sacred writings relate, before that the purpose of God shall be fulfilled. In the next place, we must know that this name cannot be uttered by the mouth of man, as Hermes teaches, saying these things: "Now the cause of this cause is the will of the divine good which produced God, whose name cannot be uttered by the mouth of man." And shortly afterwards to His Son: "There is, O Son, a secret word of wisdom, holy respecting the only Lord of all things, and the God first perceived by the mind, to speak of whom is beyond the power of man." But although His name, which the supreme Father gave Him from the beginning, is known to none but Himself, nevertheless He has one name among the angels, and another among men, since He is called



Jesus among men: for Christ is not a proper name, but a title of power and dominion; for by this the Jews were accustomed to call their kings. But the meaning of this name must be set forth, on account of the error of the ignorant, who by the change of a letter are
accustomed to call Him Chrestus. The Jews had before been directed to compose a sacred oil, with which those who were called to the priesthood or to the kingdom might be anointed. And as now the robe of purple is a sign of the assumption of royal dignity among the Romans, so with them the anointing with the holy oil conferred the title and power of king. But since the ancient Greeks used the word chri'esthai to express the art of anointing, which they now express by alei'phesthai, as the verse of Homer shows,"But the attendants washed, and anointed them with oil;" on this account we call Him Christ, that is, the Anointed, who in Hebrew is called the Messias. Hence in some Greek writings, which are badly translated from the Hebrew, the word eleimmenos is found written, from the word aleiphesthai, anointing. But, however, by either name a king is signified: not that He has obtained this earthly kingdom, the time for receiving which has not yet arrived, but that He sways a heavenly and eternal kingdom, concerning which we shall speak in the last book. But now let us speak of His first nativity.
Let's summarise: a book dated to the 6th century, supposedly copied from one written by a ghost (supposedly ca. 250 – ca. 325), claims that all the earlier texts - non of which used Christ but either an abbreviation, or Chrest - are wrong, and wrong because they were ignorant, whereas this non-existent author knew better.
The original New Testament makes no mention of "Christ"; the original has "Chrest" and ,much later the Greek for E was scratched to alter it to an I. This extract actually read: The disciples were called Chrestians first at Antioch.
And which becomes history? The early texts, or this 6th-century one? Theologians and historians have all accepted the nonsensical reason based on nothing. They all teach Christ and that this is history.
Which would a law court accept? In principle, none of them, because none are eye-witnesses, or even contemporaneous to the people and events they claim to describe. But the least likely in the 6th-century text claiming that everyone before him was in error.

The archaeological evidence is that those people later described as 'early Christians' practised Greek Magic and worshipped a magician using a magic wand; they had not the slightest inkling of any Christ, or what such a title may have meant.
The correct question is therefore not if "early Christians" were ignorant (they were definitely pagan); rather, we should question those who accept the explanation that Chrest was written in ignorance. If the authors of the original New Testament cannot be trusted by Christians, then they have nothing.

Master and Servant - Origins of Christianity
12-15 minutes
What was the point of the New Testament, the new religion? Why the parody? Why did Rome need to destroy Judea? Why pick on the Jews? These are the sort of questions which come to mind as one unravels the false history - thetextual tradition - concocted when the Western Roman Empire ended, and the archaeology of Chrestianity is allowed to appear in its own right.
The parody which is the New Testament was to make a point. The Chrestian original was made probably in the 4th century (I would guess late, ca 380) and the Christian version in the 6th (probably early), if we accept consensus dating for the massive series of alterations. Both, however, were made to imperial order. Putting aside exactly when, which would reveal "who", two emperors must have decided that this book was needed; to serve what imperial purposes?
I very much prefer trying to let the facts speak for themselves as far as they are able (hence my presenting so many quotations), so let us look at some of them, to see what they tell us.
The rebellions in Judea against the Herodian monarchy only became anti-Roman because observant Jews could not bring themselves to accept the imperial cult, which placed the (divine) emperor above Yahweh. But this was not enough to bring about the Jewish-Roman wars - something more was needed. The attacks on James, a Righteous Teacher, was certainly instrumental and maybe pivotal; Saul was the leader of the first attack, mirrored darkly in the New Testament with the attack on Stephen.
Saul stands out as the most obvious cause of the first war. His life was devoted to attacking Messianic Jews, then infiltrating Qumran, using his missionary activities as cover for building up his own, GrecoRoman cult, and finally instigating war when he tried to take his cult members into the Temple. He did not work alone, though, as we see in his debriefing by the king and Drusilla; in Rome he had Epaphroditus, effectively prime minister; there is the traitor Josephus and his connection with Poppaea Sabina is also probably through Epaphroditus. These others are not Jewish in any form; I surmise they are all Chrestian, connected through the servants of Antonia Minor, and these include the family of the Alabarch in Alexandria.
The Jewish-Roman wars are therefore not a mere continuation of local rebellions against the Herodian monarchy; they are initiated by the Chrestians and most likely continued by them into the next two, meaning that Trajan and Hadrian must have been involved to some extent, if not fully.
Nero has my sympathy. No matter how connected various emperor are to Antonia Minor, this does not force them into the Chrestian cult - Herod Agrippa I managed to escape the Chrestian clutches, so other leaders should have been able to do so. How Saul is taken to meet Nero in Corinth and disappears is telling; as Vespasian - who must have been Chrestian by then (through his second wife, Antonia Caenis, former slave of Antonia Minor) - and others were also in attendance; they would have been on



tenterhooks as Saul was interrogated, probably tortured (this is the usual method). Nero finds out enough to realise how his wife betrayed him - enough to seal his own death warrant at Chrestian hands.
The point here is that the issue with Judea was with the Chrestians, not imperial Rome. The Romanisation policy of Augustus had come home to roost, so that the provincial royals needed the support of imperial authority more than the emperor needed them.
This covert relationship between Rome and its provinces should, I would think, connect to the corruption apparent during the Republic, as exposed by Cicero. Roman law limited the how much senators could screw out of the provinces, but greed was over-powering (think: modern banking scandals). I would also suppose that the assassination of Julius Caesar was associated with this. I think there is an argument to link Chrestians with such high-level corruption; an audit of the books of Jucundus and his associates could be revealing.
"Audi Chrestianos saevos olores" - "Hear the rage of stinking Chrestians" (Inscription in Pompeii)
The Great Fire of Rome is also linked by witness testimony to imperial chamberlains, whose leader is Epaphroditus at this time, and this arson to property speculation. In that regard, one must bear in mind that the foundations of the Basilica di San Clemente are built in the ashes of that fire. Though the Clements of the textual tradition are fictional, there is this:



Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Clemens was a nephew of the Roman Emperor Vespasian. He was the son of Titus Flavius Sabinus, consul in AD 52 and praefectus urbi during the reign of Nero, and a brother of Titus Flavius Sabinus, consul in AD 82. The emperors Titus and Domitian were his cousins. Clemens' brother was consul with Domitian, shortly after the latter's accession, but the emperor put his cousin to death on the pretext that the herald proclaiming him consul had called him Imperator....in AD 95, when Clemens and the emperor were consuls, Domitian
had his cousin put to death.[2]According to Cassius Dio, Clemens was put to death on a charge of atheism, for which, he adds, many others who went over to the Jewish opinions
were executed.[3] This may imply that Clemens had become a Christian. For the same
reason, his wife was banished to Pandataria.[4][5][6]To this Clemens in all probability is dedicated the church of St. Clement at Rome...
Domitian put Epaphroditus to death, probably for the assassination of Nero, from which we may assume Domitian was not Chrestian, as opposed to his father Vespasian and brother, Titus.
It is Vespasian and Titus (along with their Chrestian community) who ensure that Chrestianity is embedded into the imperial court and thus Trajan, Hadrian and Antonius Pius are also probably Chrestian - the last becoming the mythical "Pope Pius" of the textual tradition.
The religiopolitical situation in Rome vis-à-vis Judaism therefore had changed dramatically by the mid2nd century, due primarily to covert Chrestianity within the imperial system. We can now see this cult spread across the Levant in the 3rd and 4th centuries, when Constantine I adopts its icon, the Chi-Rho, which then appears associated with artefacts for baptism, across the empire. The chrestic roots were now reaching full bloom and the New Testament appears
Those broadly are the facts. Though Messianic Judaism was not a threat to imperial Rome, no doubt it was seen as a threat by provincial royalty entirely dependent on imperial support, as were most if not all of them other than Herod Agrippa I. If it had been a serious threat to Rome, then we should expect to see this clearly in imperial edicts and actions in the decades leading to the first war, and we do not.
The parody of the New Testament turns around the Master-Servant relationship:



Isaiah 53, taken from the Book of Isaiah, is the last of the four Songs of the Suffering Servant, and tells the story of a "Man of Sorrows" or "God's Suffering Servant". Many Christians believe the "Man of Sorrows" or the "Suffering Servant" to be a reference to the prophecy of the Ministry of Jesus, which became a common theme in medieval and later Christian art. The passage of 'Isaiah 53' is known for its interpretation and use by Christian Theologians and Missionaries, many of whom identify the servant to be Christ Jesus. Many Christians view the entire chapter, and particularly this passage to refer to the Passion of Christ as well as the absolution of sins believed to be made possible by his sacrificial death.
“He was taken from prison and from judgment:......and who shall declare his generation?...... for he was cut off out of the land of the living:...... for the transgression of
my people was he stricken....” (53:8 KJV)[2]Jewish scripture in Isaiah 52:13 through Isaiah 53:12 describes the servant of the Lord as the Nation of Israel itself: “My Servant...” (Isaiah 53:11), “...a man of pains and accustomed to illness...” (Isaiah 53:3). "The theme of Isaiah is jubilation, a song of celebration at the imminent end of the Babylonian Captivity". Judaism sees this passage, especially "God's Suffering Servant", being written over 2500 years before nowadays, without a reference to the king Mashiach...
New Testament One of the first claims in the New Testament that Isaiah 53 is a prophecy of Jesus comes from the Book of Acts, in which its author (who is also the author of Luke), describes a scene in which God commands Philip the Deacon to approach an Ethiopian eunuch who is sitting in a chariot, reading aloud to himself from the Book of Isaiah. The eunuch comments that he does not understand what he is reading (Isaiah 53) and Philip explains to him the teachings of Jesus. "And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus." This has been the standard Christian interpretation of the passage since Apostolic times.
And there in full view, is the parody. Eisenman revealed this in detail; reviewed by Price:
Where did Luke find his raw material for the prophecy of Agabus of a great famine to transpire in Claudius' reign, of Paul's trip from Antioch to deliver famine relief funds to Jerusalem, and for the earlier tale of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch? Again, from Josephus (though perhaps also from other cognate sources of information). It all stems, by hook and by crook, from the story of Helen, Queen of Adiabene, a realm contiguous and/or overlapping with Edessa, whose king Agbar/Abgarus some sources make Helen's husband. Helen and her son Izates converted to Judaism, though initially Izates refrained from circumcision on the counsel of an unnamed Jewish teacher who assured him the worship of God was more important than circumcision...
But we pick up the Helen story again back in chapter 8, with Philip substituted for Paul, where Philip accosts the financial officer of a foreign queen going from Jerusalem down through Egypt by way of Gaza. This is of course the Ethiopian eunuch. Why has Luke transformed Helen the Queen of Adiabene into Candace the Queen of Ethiopia? He has reverted to an Old Testament prototype, making Helen, a convert to Judaism, into a New Testament Queen of Sheba, having come to Jerusalem to hear the wisdom of Solomon. There is also a pun on the root saba, denoting baptism, a la the Essenes, Sampsaeans, Sabeans, Masbutheans, and Mandaeans, the type of Judaism Helen would have converted to (given the later Zealot involvements of her sons and her own reputed 21 years of Nazirite



asceticism). Henry Cadbury pointed out long ago that Luke has fallen into the same trap as a number of literary contemporaries by taking as a personal name, Candace, the title of all the old Ethiopian queens, kandake, but Eisenman sees also a pun on the name of Helen's son Kenedaeos, who gave his life for his adopted people in the Roman War. In any case, there were no Ethiopian queens at this time.
When the prophet Agabus predicts the famine, Luke has derived his name from that of Helen's husband Agbarus. When the eunuch invites Philip to step up into his chariot, we have an echo of Jehu welcoming Jonadab into his chariot. When Philip asks the Ethiopian if he understands what he reads, Luke has borrowed this from the story of Izates and Eliezer, where the question also presages a ritual conversion, only this time the text is Isaiah's prophecy of Jesus, and the ritual is baptism. The original circumcision survives in the form of crude parody (recalling Galatians 5:12) with the Ethiopian having been fully castrated. Even the location of the Acts episode is dictated by the Helen story, as the Ethiopian travels into Egypt via Gaza as Helen's agents must have in order to buy the grain. Luke's substituted motivation for the trip, by contrast, is absurd: a eunuch could not have gone to Jerusalem to worship since eunuchs were barred from the Temple!
The textual tradition is a perversion: its "histories", anti-heresies, its sacred texts. Only a little scholarship is needed to realise that much is fundamentally wrong - the gospels themselves are so self-contradictory that even a little rational thought should ring alarm bells, regardless of the miracles. So why have them and why still teach them - as English law insists - as history? Because they still do the job for which they are designed - they separate us into identifiable groups.
I define the "good" for which Chrest is commonly translated as in "the great and the good" and society needs only a few of these. The simple have their uses, the rebels can be dealt with; what this society is looking for are those who listened, learned and accepted: follow the Roman custom of separating private and public belief - always demonstrate loyalty to the system, your Lord and Master. This is the call of the imperial cult, against which Judas the Galilean rebelled.

The Chrestian 'Gospel of the Lots of Mary' - Origins of
Christianity
2-2 minutes
Opening of the Gospel of the Lots of Mary.
For the name and title of its divine man, look to the 6th line.
Described by scholars and news media alike as Christian of the 5-6th centuries, it is claimed to start thus:
The Gospel of the lots of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ, she to whom Gabriel the archangel brought the good news. He who will go forward (or: will seek) with his whole heart will obtain what he seeks. Only do not be of two minds.
If you look down to the sixth line, you will see where the name of the divine man appears: it is two sets of two letters, their divinity indicated by the two over-scores.
So what is the name and title? IC XC
These abbreviations tell us that this little gospel is, in fact, Chrestian (for the same abbreviations appear in other early, sacred texts with 'Chrest').
Adding the scholarly opinions to our own, evidence-based history, we may say how:
The gospel belonged probably to a woman. The term 'gospel' is wider than previously thought.



The book was used for fortune-telling.
I would surmise from this that 'Jesus Christ' and Christianity had not yet appeared and that this supports my view of how Chrestianity is based on the magic of pharaonic Egypt syncretised with that of the Greeks.

From the Ankh of the pharaohs, to the Ch-Rho of the Ptolemies, then via

children - so the religion of Ancient Egypt became Greek and then Greco
Roman, entering the Roman Empire of Augustus as Chrestianity.

Magic of Chrestianity - Origins of Christianity
4-5 minutes
Magic of Chrestianity
Though religion is belief in the supernatural, Chrestianity was born out of Greek Magic, particularly Neopythagoreanism of the early days of the Roman Empire. In later centuries, this developed into Neoplatonic magic and various mystic cults, before becoming recognisably Gnostic, then giving way to Christianity.
Though the historicity of this Apollonius of Tyana is not proven, he was widely believed to be a successful and highly-respected miracle-worker of the early-1st century.
Drawing evidence from various literary, religious and magical sources, this thesis will demonstrate that the methods of healing and exorcism employed by Jesus in the Gospels are extensively paralleled within the ancient magical



tradition and the secretive and coercive behaviour typically associated with the magicians of antiquity can be clearly discerned not only within the hostile polemical materials, but in the portrait of Jesus presented by the Gospel authors themselves. In addition, Jesus' authoritative behaviour and his competent application of common techniques of magical spirit-manipulation involving the dead, the demonic and the divine throughout the Gospels indicates that the correlation between Jesus and his spiritual power-source is far from consistent with a model of passive spiritpossession, but is comparable instead to the coercive relationship that existed between a magician and his assisting spirit in the ancient world. (Abstract from PhD
thesis Dragging Down Heaven: Jesus as Magician and Manipulator of Spirits in the Gospels by Dr Helen Ingram)
The apocryphical Acts of Thomas mentions one king Gudnaphar. This king has been associated with Gondophares I by many scholars, as it was not yet established that there were several kings with the same name. Richard N. Frye, Emeritus Professor of Iranian Studies at Harvard University, has noted that this ruler has been identified with a king called Caspar in the Christian
tradition of the Apostle St Thomas and his visit to India.[9] Recent research by R.C. Senior shows with some certainty that the king who best fits these references was Gondophares-Sases, the fourth king using the title
Gondophares.[10]

Coin of Gondophares
From "Coins of the Indo-Greeks", Whitehead, 1915 edition
Sases, also known as Gondophares IV Sases, (ruled for at least 26 years during the mid-1st century CE), was an Indo-Parthian king who ruled in northwestern parts of India in modern Pakistan.
Compare the man holding the sceptre of Zeus, with the image of "Izates", said by Josephus to be king of Adiabene in the early-1st century.
This Acts also compares with the Acts of the Apostles describing Saul/Paul's mission, travels, miracles and conversions.

The chrestic Buddha of Mes Aynak - Origins of Christianity
6-8 minutes
Rescuing this site in what was Greco-India has gained much valued support. Before it is erased - either by mining or the Taliban - I will address the question: how is a large, Buddhist centre based around such a rich copper mine, and on the fabulously-wealthy Silk Road?
First, an introduction:



Mes Aynak (Pashto: مس عینک , meaning "little source of copper", from 'ayn = source) is a site 25 miles (40 km) southeast of Kabul, Afghanistan, located in a barren region of Logar Province. The site contains Afghanistan's largest copper deposit, as well as the remains of an ancient settlement with over 400 Buddha statues, stupas and a 100-acre (40 ha) monastery complex.
The pale blue section arcing around the mining and civic sections (in the illustration, right) is where the religion structures were placed.
What we have is a major Buddhist site producing copper and taking part in trade.
History
As the name suggests, the presence of copper at Mes Aynak has been known about for some time, while the site's archaeological wealth has been known about since exploration by Russian and
Afghan geologists in 1973-4.
[1]
The earliest Buddhist remains date from the Kushan Gandhara era, although these gradually give way to T'ang Chinese and Uyghur influences. Mes Aynak was at the peak of its prosperity between the fifth and seventh century AD, a period of slow decline began in the eighth century and the settlement was
finally abandoned 200 years later.

The Kushan empire appears on maps very largely where is the Indo-Scythian empire, i.e. the region conquered by Alexander and then settled by Greeks: Greco-India. Who exactly are the Kushans is unknown; they look to me to be very similar to the Scythians and if they were to be branches of the same tribe/family, I would not be surprised.



When Buddha appears in Kushan Bactria, he is Greek:
Left: Standing Buddha, ancient region ofGandhara, eastern Afghanistan, 1st century CE.
Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the Greco-Roman toga-like wavy robe covering both shoulders (more exactly, its lighter version, the Greek himation), the contrapposto stance of the upright figures (see: 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas), the stylicized Mediterranean curly hair and topknot (ushnisha) apparently derived from the style of the Belvedere Apollo (330 BCE), and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism. A large quantity of sculptures combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and iconography were excavated at the Gandharan site of Hadda. The 'curly hair' of Buddha is described in the famous list of 32 external characteristics of a Great Being (mahapurusa) that we find all along the Buddhist sutras. The curly hair, with the curls turning to the right is first described in the Pali canon; we find the same description in e.g. the "Dasasahasrika Prajnaparamita". Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display "a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by Persia or Bactria, nor distinctively Roman".
The Kushans had diplomatic contact with imperial Rome; so much Roman gold was paid eastwards that eventually the imperial court restricted trade; the British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler used Roman coins to date cultural layers in India. Greco-India - not the Subcontinent - refers to what the ancients called India, a practise which confuses many today.
So Buddha first appears as a Greek, in full, human form in the late 1st-century; about a century later, a new genre of religious literature appears, describing the travels of Greek philosopher miracle-workers, converting royalty in the east, usually Greco-India. The home of this genre was along the western end of the Silk Road, Edessa. This is where, I think, also came the first gospel account.
The Kushan Buddha is, I think, a result of Chrestian resurrection, in which a cultic hero is resurrected by the same Greek magic as used by Cleopatra VII to become Isis, and by Hadrian to resurrect Antinous.
Similarly, Mes Aynak was a monastic centre tied intimately to the economic activities of copper and trade, just as Egyptian monasteries were associated with production (wine, pottery and glass) and trade (including the slave routes to Sub-Saharan Africa); also early monasteries of Western Europe - often based on Roman villas using slave labour - owned by local royal families. That is, monasticism of the early-modern era shares important characteristics wherever they are and no matter to which religion they belonged. When not Chrestian, they are chrestic.



Buddha has the same halo as we see for saints and divine rulers in the west.
A halo (from Greek ἅλως, halōs; also known as a nimbus, aureole, glory, or gloriole) is a ring of light that surrounds a person in art. They have been used in the iconography of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures, and have at various periods also been used in images of rulers or heroes. In the sacred art of Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity, among other religions, sacred persons may be depicted with a halo in the form of a circular glow, or in Asian art flames, around the head, or around the whole body, this last often called a mandorla. Halos may be shown as almost any colour, but as they represent light are most often depicted as golden, yellow, white, or red when flames are depicted.
Mahasena on a coin of Huvishka
The halo and the aureola have been widely used in Indian art, particularly
in Buddhist iconography where it has appeared since at least the 1st century AD; the
Kushan Bimaran casket in the British Museum is dated 60AD (at least between 30BC and 200AD). The rulers of the Kushan Empire were perhaps the earliest to give themselves haloes on their coins, and the nimbus in art may have originated in Central Asia and spread both east and west.
I therefore see the Kushans as a branch of the Indo-Scythians, and allied with imperial Rome.

Archaeology of "Chrest" >
Phrygian Chrestianity
Phrygia in Classical Antiquity is best known today for its red cap, famously worn by the
Magi.
Left: Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, Italy: The Three Wise Men" (named
Balthasar, Melchior, and Gaspar). Detail from: "Mary and Child, surrounded by angels",
mosaic of a Ravennate Italian-Byzantine workshop, completed within 526 CE by the so
called "Master of Sant'Apollinare".
This tradition - as with Ravenna in this period - is commonly claimed as Arian, though it is
described here as Chrestian.
The Phrygian red cap has other, important associations.
Mithras - the name is a form of Mithra, the name of an Old Persian god - wore the
Phrygian red cap. He was worshipped by Roman soldiers and Romans regarded the
Mithraic Mysteries as having Persian or Zoroastrian sources.
Phrygia has long been regarded as the home of an ancient and heretical brand of Christianity, which was termed Montanist:
Montanism was an early Christian movement of the late 2nd century, later referred to by the name of its founder, Montanus, but originally known by its adherents as the New Prophecy. It originated in Phrygia, a province of Asia Minor, and flourished throughout the region, leading to the movement being referred to elsewhere as "Cataphrygian" (meaning it was "from Phrygia") or simply as "Phrygian". It spread rapidly to other regions in the Roman Empire at a time before Christianity was generally tolerated or legal. It persisted in some isolated places into the 6th century.
But just as Arianism has no bishop Arius, so Montanism has no Montanus - they are creations of
the medieval textual tradition in order to erase Chrestianity from the historical record.
Archaeologists from the 19th century on have studied the Tembris Valley in Phrygia and found
many references to Chrestians, starting in the early 3rd century. Later, the eta of Chrest is joined
by an iota to make Chreist, then the original eta is either destroyed in some cases, or omitted, and
Christ appears.
Phrygia and the Tembris Valley
This Chrestian Church seems to have been the result of the missionary
work of Saul, the Herodian agent provocateur working to destroy the
Qumran community of James the Just.
The Seven Churches of Revelation, also known as The Seven Churches of the Apocalypse and The Seven Churches of Asia (referring to the Roman province of Asia, not the entire continent), are seven major churches of Early Christianity, as mentioned in the New Testament Book of Revelation.
The location of Phrygia is also interesting in a number of other regards: its
close relation to the kingdom of Pergamon, ruled by Lysimachus, the
general of Alexander the Great's bodyguard and whose child became co
founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt; as home to the "Great Mother",
Cybele, which became popular in imperial Rome; and the worship there
of Sabazios, the sky and father-god depicted on horseback. All these may
have influenced both Chrestianity and later, Christianity.
A little to the north is the Black Sea port of Sinope and this may not be coincidental, for two
men were known as of Sinope who both played in important role in Chrestianity:
- Aquila, whom both Jewish and Christian tradition claim as a convert as well as a member of
the family of the emperor Hadrian - and as architect of Aelia Capitolina atop the destroyed
Jerusalem, banning Jews entry there, may be regarded as instrumental in provoking the Third
Jewish-Roman War (the role played by Saul in the First); and
- Marcion, who seems to have led a Chrestian Church in the region in the 3rd-early-4th
century. His divine man is Isu Chrestos, not Jesus Christ. Although the Christian textual
tradition claims knowledge of Marcion, Marcionites and their faith, little contemporaneous
evidence exists for any of it; in this, Marcion appears to be "Pauline", rejecting Jewish Law
and tradition.
But the first collector of the Pauline Epistles had been Marcion. No one else we know of would be a good candidate, certainly not the essentially fictive Luke, Timothy, and Onesimus. And Marcion, as Burkitt and Bauer show, fills the bill perfectly.1 2
Marcion therefore probably had an important role in creating the Pauline textual tradition for
the Chrestian Church, and which - through imperial sponsorship in the 4th century - was merged with the gospel textual tradition (and The Shepherd of Hermas)
to form the New Testament.
It may not be coincidental that the Gothic invasion of the Eastern empire in the mid-3rd century
featured a seaborne attack from Scythian Crimea landing at Sinope, entering Roman Asia, a major
event for which almost no contemporaneous record now exists.
Emperor worship was prevalent in provincial communities during the Roman empire. Soon after Augustus came to power, temples erected in his honor sprang up across Asia province. The establishment of provincial centers of emperor worship further spawned local cults. These sites served as models followed by other provinces throughout the empire... The Gothic invasions of the 250s and 260s, part of the Crisis of the Third Century, contributed to failing feelings of security. - Asia (Roman province)
Phrygian Chrestianity springs from Saul (who becomes the divine Paul), is imperially sponsored,
denies Jewish Law, and develops its own textual tradition which has neither a Jesus, nor Christ.

Chrestians and the Unnamed God - Origins of Christianity
11-14 minutes
Sabazios is the nomadic horseman and sky father god of the Phrygians and Thracians. In IndoEuropean languages, such as Phrygian, the -zios element in his name derives from dyeus, the common precursor of Latin deus ('god') and Greek Zeus. Though the Greeks interpreted Phrygian Sabazios with both Zeus and Dionysus, representations of him, even into Roman times, show him always on horseback, as a nomadic horseman god, wielding his characteristic staff of power.
The iconic image of the god or hero on horseback battling the chthonic serpent, on which his horse tramples, appears on Celtic votive columns, and with the coming of Christianity it was easily transformed into the image of Saint George and the Dragon, whose earliest known depictions are from tenth- and eleventh-century Cappadocia and eleventh-century Georgia and Armenia. (Sabazios)
Little is yet known, or understood for the Chrestian Church, founded probably by Saul in the mid-1st century. The Book of Revelation names seven churches in Asia and these may well be the same. Then in the 3rd century, monumental inscriptions first appear in Phrygia, close by these churches, and bearing the title Chrest, then Chreist, and later, Christ.



From the stance taken by Saul - which we know from the chronicles of Josephus, and these corroborate in part the later tradition appearing in the New Testament - we may speculate that Saul's Church does not know, or recognise any divine man beyond Saul/Paul himself, is rooted in Greek culture, and although claiming a Jewish theological heritage, does not recognise Jewish Law.
This Phrygian archaeology with Chrest has been traditionally described as belonging to a(n imaginary) heretical sect termed Montanist, though modern scholarship has now moved away from that position. As mentioned elsewhere in this site, archaeologists have often found confusing the various Levantine cults containing some Jewish references, for they do not know whether these are really Jewish, or composed of converts to Judaism, or something else entirely. One example is:
Hypsistarians, i.e. worshippers of the Hypsistos (Greek: Ὕψιστος, the "Most High" God), is a term appearing in documents dated about 200 BC to about AD 400, referring to various groups mostly in Asia Minor (Cappadocia, Bithynia and Pontus) and on the South Russian coasts of what is today known as the Black Sea.
...a great number of votive tablets, inscriptions and oracles of Didymos and Klaros establish beyond doubt that the cult of the Hypsistos (Hypsistos, with the addition of Theos 'god' or Zeus or Attis, but frequently without addition) as the sole God was widespread in the countries adjacent to the Bosphorus (cf. Acts 16:17, "these men are servants of the most high God" — oracle of the pythonissa at Philippi). (Hypsistarians)
A modern, scholarly view:



The prominence of God-fearers in the territories evangelized by Paul, notably at Pisidian Antioch and Iconium, speaks to the identification of this group with the
Hypsistarian worshippers.1 The emphasis on angels as divine intermediaries between Theos Hypsistos and the Hypsistarian worshippers not only parallels the function of Hermes in the cult of Zeus, but it is also one of the Jewish emphases in Asia Minor, the origins of which, as we have suggested, commence with the Essenes and culminate for Paul in an unwarranted emphasis on angels in the Colossian church. Mitchell traces ‘the concept of Theos Hypsistos and his angels’ in Anatolia to ‘the unhellenized communities of the interior of Asia Minor’, which ‘drew on the
indigenous tradition which favored both monotheism and an ascetic religious morality’.2
1. Mitchell, ‘The Cult of Theos Hypsistos’, p. 126
2. Mitchell observes: ‘The virtually limitless tolerance which the pagan gods showed to newcomers made the system almost infinitely flexible. As Hellenized culture and literacy slowly embraced the native populations of Anatolia, it had no difficulty in acknowledging the religious beliefs and practices of Asia Minor’s indigenous inhabitants as part of one and the same religious system’ (Anatolia, II, pp. 30-31).
The synagogue on the island of Delos has caused similar confusion, which is here clarified as non-Jewish:
Plassart’s other five inscriptions were found scattered around GD80 (Plassart 1913: 528), and among these was one which contained one of the donor names found in ID 2329 above. Three of the inscriptions contained the epithet Theo Hypsisto, and one contained the epithet Hypsisto. Plassart’s final inscription retained only two legible words, genomenos eleutheros ‘...became free’ (Plassart 1913: 528).
In an article written in 1913, Andre ́ Plassart laid out his argument that the use of the epithets Hypsisto or Theo Hypsisto indicated a tendency towards monotheism and therefore referred to the Jewish deity. However, in the same article, he noted that an inscription had recently been found in Lydia, bearing the epithet Thea Hypsista, probably referring to the Great Mother Goddess of Asia Minor, and that other similar inscriptions had been found in relation to the Thracian-Phrygian deity Dionysos-Sabazios and to the Syrian Zeus of Heliopolis (Plassart 1913: 529).
However, the inscriptions that refer to Hypsistos may also refer to the Greek deity Zeus Hypsistos, whose cult (a healing cult, and a more likely association given the physical form of the inscription bases) also used these epithets to describe their chief deity. The sanctuary of the cult of Zeus Hypsistos was located on Mt. Cynthus, less than 500m from GD80.
Belle Mazur (1935: 21–22) noted that the style of the inscribed bases was inconsistent with Jewish practice, in particular the proseuche and the Lysimachos inscriptions which had lead fixings in place for votive offerings or statues. She made the first connection with the Greek cult of Zeus Hypsistos,



in whose sanctuary on the Athenian Pnyx were found similar inscribed bases, and to the cult of Theos Hypsistos from Asia Minor.
Interestingly, there is another cult that used the epithets Hypsistos and Theos Hypsistos: the Hypsistarians who, while they recognized other gods, considered theirs as being above all. Part of their ritual is described in an inscription carved on one of the blocks of the Hellenistic inner face of the city wall of Oenoanda in northern Lycia:
Born of itself, untaught, without a mother, unshakeable, not contained in a name, known by many names, dwelling in fire, this is god. We, his angels, are a small part of god. To you who ask this question about god, what his essential nature is, he has pronounced that Aether is god who sees all, on whom you should gaze and pray at dawn, looking towards the sunrise. (Mitchell 1999: 193–4)
According to descriptions of their practices, the Hypsistarians stood in the open air facing east, looking up to heaven and offering their prayers. Lamps and fire were an essential part of their cult, which was associated with heaven and the sun (Mitchell 1999: 91), and, by the dedication of light, it was thought possible to establish a link with the deity (Mitchell 1999: 92).
The final phase of building GD80 is oriented eastwards, is unroofed, and 40 lamps were found in it by Plassart’s excavation team. While it is impossible (and, indeed, would be foolish) to attribute the use of the final phase of GD 80 to the Hypsistarians, there is nothing to suggest that the lamps could not have been used in a ritual such as that described in the Oenoanda Oracle. There is certainly no known Jewish ritual with which to compare this and, to add further to this idea, even as late as the fourth century AD, Hypsistarians were sometimes mistaken for Jews (Mitchell 1999: 9394). In any event, I have offered the Hypsistarians up for consideration only to illustrate how tenuous and tendentious the identification of GD80 as a Jewish and/or Samaritan synagogue is.
Wall Painting of Julius Terentius Performing a Sacrifice
From the Temple of the Palmyrene Gods, Dura-Europos, ca. 239 CE
Yale University Art Gallery, Yale-French Excavations at Dura-Europos: 1931.386
Near the trading post of Dura Europos, where archaeologists found a 3rd-century baptistery and Dura fragment 24 (passages of which later appear in the New Testament gospels), is the ancient Aramaic city of Palmyra, a caravan stop on the Silk Road as it crosses the Syrian desert; its ancient name was Tadmor (a fact which gains importance when considering the conversion of the empress Zenobia, queen of Tadmor, to Manichaeism). Archaeologists have excavated from here hundreds of altars dedicated to the Anonymous God inscribed "to the one whose name is blessed forever".



These altars are half-columns with a very small bowl, only large enough for burning incense, while altars dedicated to other gods have space for the sacrifice of bigger and different kinds of offerings (even a garlanded bullock, as pictured at bottom left).
You can see just such an incense offering in the famous fresco from the Temple of the Palmyran Gods in Dura Europos: An officer named Julius Terentius leads the soldiers of the XXth Palmyrenes, a cohort of mounted archers stationed on the Euphrates, in a ritual of bloodless sacrifice. He burns incense in honour of the three cult statues of gods dressed in military costume (Yarhibol, Aglibol, and Arsu), ranged on their pedestals on the upper left side of the fresco. Beside Terentius is the standard bearer of the cohort with the troop colours and, next to him, a seated goddess who wears the mural (city) crown: an inscription identifies her as the god (Tyche/Good Fortune) of Palmyra. (The Unknown God of Palmyra by Judith Weingarten, blog post 28 February 2010)
Dura Europos had become Roman and an important garrison town on the eastern border:
During the later 2nd century BC it came under Parthian control and in the 1st century BC, it served as a frontier fortress of the Arsacid Parthian Empire, with a multicultural population, as inscriptions in Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Hatrian, Palmyrenean, Middle Persian and Safaitic Pahlavi testify. It was captured by the Romans in 165 and abandoned after a Sassanian siege in 256-257. After it was abandoned, it was covered by sand and mud and disappeared from sight.
Rome allowed only a handful of the temples there to remain, among them the synagogue and baptistery. In the last days of Roman occupation, troops filled in and covered over these two, to strengthen the town wall against impending attack - which is how archaeologists found them in the 20th century. This is strong evidence that imperial Rome approved both Rabbinic Judaism and the faith of the baptistery during this period.
It might be tempting to see all this as leading, organically, to Christianity - after all, here are many of the elements; but that is not how it happened, for this new religion is an imperial creation of a later period, which led to theological scholars trawling imperial records to cherry-pick events, people, cults and their sacred texts, then melding them all into its new textual tradition. Even Chrestianity was not sacred to these clerics - The Shepherd of Hermas was dropped from the New Testament, nomina sacra were re-interpreted to spell out Jesus and Chrest was remade Christ. There were plenty of trinities to play with, many executed soldiers and desert ascetics to chose as saints, and numerous cults to be utilised - and utility to the imperial cause was the sole determining factor.
Quite what may have linked Saul, the seven churches, Phrygian Chrestianity and the Anonymous God is both speculative and not quite to the point of Christian origins. They were to be looted; nothing is sacred to the Church of Rome except itself.

Vivas In Deo - Origins of Christianity
9-11 minutes
The Portable Antiquities Scheme: The formula VIVAS IN DEO is a Christian one, the translation of this inscription being 'Antonius, may you live in God'.
The BBC: Adrian Marsden, finds officer based at Norwich Castle Museum: The disc that would have been set into the bezel from a signet ring constitutes important evidence for Christianity in late Roman Norfolk.
This is the usual assumption and has no basis in historicity; there is no Christianity in this period, in Britain or elsewhere. The idea behind the claim is that the Latin expression derives from the Greek books of the New Testament, such as:
And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. (1 John 4:16, New International Version)
...it could perhaps be read as being a blessing/protection being sent by Antonius, as well as for him. To the receiver, as well as the bearer. Of course, that is not to say that everyone, particularly nonChristians, would have recognised it for what it was; although interestingly, there are examples of similar rings with representations of Mercury and such like.
As stated in numerous other parts of this site, there is no mention of Christ, Christian or Christianity in the original New Testament, which becomes adopted by Christianity some centuries later. The usage of nomina sacra indicates strongly how it is Chrestian and a product of Greek, or panhellenistic culture.



The Ring of Silvianus is a gold ring, dating probably from the 4th century, discovered in a ploughed field near Silchester, in Hampshire, England:
The Ring of Silvianus is larger than most rings, being 25 mm (1 in) in diameter and weighing 12 g (0.4 oz), and was perhaps intended to be worn over a glove. The band of the ring has ten facets. It is set with a square bezel engraved with an image of the goddess Venus. To one side are the letters "VE" and to the other side "NVS", in mirror writing. When used as a signet ring to make a seal, the head and script would be raised, and the letters would appear the right way around.
The band is inscribed with the words "SENICIANE VIVAS IIN DE". This contains two errors as the "I" has been doubled, leaving no room for the last letter "O". The inscription should have finished "VIVAS IN DEO" — a common inscription for Roman Christians, meaning "live in God".
The goddess Venus suggests that the invocation is pagan. further supported by this association of the ring's owner, Silvianus, with the god Nodens:
In the early 19th century a lead plaque of a type known as a "curse tablet" or defixio was discovered at the site of a Roman temple dedicated to the god Nodens at Lydney, Gloucestershire, 80 miles (130 km) from The Vyne. The plaque was inscribed with a curse:
DEVO NODENTI SILVIANVS ANILVM PERDEDIT DEMEDIAM PARTEM DONAVIT NODENTI INTER QVIBVS NOMEN SENICIANI NOLLIS PETMITTAS SANITATEM



DONEC PERFERA VSQVE TEMPLVM DENTIS
This translates as
For the god Nodens. Silvianus has lost a ring and has donated one half [its worth] to Nodens. Among those named Senicianus permit no good health until it is returned to the temple of Nodens.
In 1929, the archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler was excavating at the Lydney site and made a connection between the ring bearing the name of Senicianus, and the curse stone bearing the same name. Wheeler called upon Tolkien, as Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, to investigate the etymology of the name "Nodens" referred to in the curse.
Curse tablets:
A curse tablet or binding spell (Latin: tabella defixionis, defixio; κατάδεσμος katadesmos in Greek) is a type of curse found throughout the Greco-Roman world, in which someone would ask the gods to do harm to others.
These texts were typically scratched on very thin sheets of lead in tiny letters, then often rolled, folded, or pierced with nails. These bound tablets were then usually placed beneath the ground: either buried in graves or tombs, thrown into wells or pools, sequestered in underground sanctuaries, or nailed to the walls of temples.
Voces mysticae are words not immediately recognizable as belonging to any known language, and are commonly associated with curse tablets. Anthropologist Stanely J. Tambiah proposed in 1968 that such words were intended to represent "the language that demons can understand".
Magic was used by the people of the Greco-Roman society to control the natural. All members of society, regardless of economic or class status, used such magic. There have been roughly 1600 curse tablets discovered, mostly written in Greek.
Right: Engraving from an Abrasax stone. Opinions abound on Abraxas, who in recent centuries has been claimed to be both an Egyptian god and a demon.
Rings from the Thetford Hoard: One ring is set with an engraved gem of brown chalcedony13 x 9.5mm. Upon it is depicted a cock-headed, snake-legged deity known as an Anguipede, holding a shield which is inscribed in



Greek with ΩΑΙ, ΙΑΩ or 'Iao' in reverse - a powerful magical word often associated with this deity. Although set in a closed-back setting, this gem was also inscribed on its reverse side with the Greek ΑΒΡΑCΞCΑΒΑΩΘ which translates as 'Abrasax Sabaoth' also a word of power and associated name of the deity. It is interesting that a Greek-inscribed charm appears in a hoard primarily associated with an Italian (Latin) minor deity (Faunus), though many other Greek inscriptions are known from Roman Britain, and other examples of late-Antique 'magical gems' have also been found in Latin-speaking provinces.
The expression vivas in deo is a Latin example typical of Greek Magic, invoking a deity for protection or as a blessing, perfectly in context with their many contemporary illustrations of the Chrestian divine man as magus, performing magic through his wand, which in turn is context with the early-1st century Chrest Magus bowl for performing divination. Many such spells are detailed in the Greek Magical Papyri:
The Greek Magical Papyri... is the name given by scholars to a body of papyri from GraecoRoman Egypt, which each contain a number of magical spells, formulae, hymns and rituals. The materials in the papyri date from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. The manuscripts came to light through the antiquities trade, from the 18th century onwards. One of the best known of these texts is the so-called Mithras Liturgy.
In many cases the formulaic words and phrases are strikingly similar to those found in defixiones (curse tablets or binding spells, κατάδεσμοι in Greek), such as those we find inscribed on ostraka, amulets and lead tablets. Since some of these defixiones date from as early as the sixth century BC, and have been found as far afield as Athens, Asia Minor, Rome and Sicily (as well as Egypt), this provides a degree of continuity and suggests that some observations based on the PGM will not be altogether inapplicable to the study of the wider Greco-Roman world.
This divine man of the gospels also appears explicitly in these spells and with the title Chrest:
If we can define the purposes of Christianity, one might be to draw a veil over its Greek magical heritage, so as to at least obscure the view.
The pagan character of these artefacts, bearing this invocation, underlines the Chrestian origin of the New Testament, which itself is replete with magic - not just the "miracles" of "IS", but also of Saul/Paul and others:



The gospels record three sorts of miracles performed by Jesus: exorcisms, cures, and nature wonders.
Other passages mention false prophets who will be able to perform miracles to deceive "if possible, even the elect of Christ" (Matthew 24:24). 2 Thessalonians 2:9 says, "And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved."
(Miracles/Religious views/Christianity)
God did extraordinary miracles through Paul (Acts 19:11)
Simon the Sorcerer or Simon the Magician, in Latin Simon Magus, (Greek Σίμων ὁ μάγος) was a Samaritan magus or religious figure...whose later confrontation with Peter is recorded in Acts 8:924
One may question the basis for the repeated, academic claim that vivas in deo is a sure indicator of Christianity, as reported by the BBC. The answer is simply that the UK is not a secular state and its institutions, such as the BBC, English Heritage, the British Museum and its great universities are all pillars of the Christian Church. Proper archaeological interpretation cannot begin until at least the disestablishment of the Church, along with all education (universities and schools) becoming secular. If that were to happen, centuries of misinterpretation would need to be undone.

From Gnosticism and Greek Magic to the (Chrestian) New
Testament - Origins of Christianity
25-32 minutes
Abraxas: a redeemed archon with the head of a rooster, the body of a man, and legs like snakes.
"Jesus, -- that is Aberamentho, -- said..." - The Pistis Sophia. Aberamentho: the mystery name of IS/Jesus.
The rooster is an Egyptian symbol of the morning sun.
[As I detest theology and magic - I've tried to avoid learning anything of superstition - I am the last person who should be attempting this subject, but as nobody else offered, here goes.]
What I'm trying to do is find the archaeology linking Chrestianity in the early-first century with the textual tradition appearing in manuscripts of the 3rd century (and which became the New Testament in the fourth). There are two cultural streams, one starting with Saul (the Herodian thug described by Jospehus) and becoming Marcionism, and another starting with Bardaisan as Source Q, to become the canonical gospels.
The geographical landscape is northern Syria and Alexandria, Egypt. The cultural landscape is colonial Greek (which includes people from various ethnic backgrounds, but choosing to live by Greek cultural norms (in a Greco-Roman world ruled by imperial Rome). The two spices added to this melting pot are the Iranian, Zoroastrian influences (dualities), because the Levant had often and for long periods lived under Iranian rule, and those of Greco-India, which kept in contact with the Levant along the Silk Road and sea trade through the Gulf.



Mithras as hunter; Mithraeum, Dura Europos. Mithras in Perso-Palmyrene attire, his weapons are typically Sassanian.
Scenes from the Book of Esther from the Dura-Europos synagogue, 244 CE. Some of the paintings have figures whose eyes have been scratched out, especially those in Iranian costume. (See the figure on the white horse in the picture at right.)



Dura Europos was a trading post on the western bank of the Euphrates, fortified by Rome in 209 CE and a made a colony by the emperor Septimius Severus in 211; Palmyra was the next city on the road to the Mediterranean coast; the native population was Arab and they had absorbed both Greek and Iranian culture. When Rome first took the city, they demolished all but a few of the places of worship. One allowed to survive was the baptistery, associated with Dura fragment 24, which I interpret as School of Bardaisan. More than caravans passed through here, more even than people - Greek philosophers and their ideas flowed eastwards and Indian religious philosophy moved into the West.
Let us set the few ground rules here:
There is no Christianity in this period; this I demonstrated years ago and in all my repetitions since, nobody has shown otherwise. A new religion appears in the first century of the modern era and its divine man is explicitly given the title Chrest; his first name is never spelled out, but abbreviated, usually as IS. This religion is therefore termed properly Chrestianity. The gospel stories are not historical, of Judea in the first century; they are literary and comparison of them to historical accounts shows conclusively that they parody these people and the events with which they are associated. The New Testament is not a product of observant, messianic Jews, or Judaism, but are principally Greek and eventually imperial.
I could go on, but to put simply, there is no Christianity until centuries later and therefore gnostic thought is not contemporaneous to Christianity; on the other hand, it is contemporaneous to Chrestianity.
We see here how the Chrestian textual tradition contains much gnostic thought.
...gnosticism as a unique and recognizable belief system is considered to be a second century (or later) development.[To this end Paul Trebilco cites the following in his article "Christian Communities In Western Asia Minor Into The Early Second Century: Ignatius And Others As Witnesses Against Bauer" in JETS 49.1: E.M. Yamauchi, “Gnosticism and Early Christianity,” in W. E. Helleman, ed. (1994). Hellenization Revisited: Shaping a Christian Response Within the GrecoRoman World.

Prior analysis used the name Jesus, but this name does not appear explicitly.

Jesus is identified by some Gnostics as an embodiment of the supreme being who became incarnate to bring gnōsis to the earth ["An Introduction to Gnosticism and The Nag Hammadi Library". The Gnostic Society Library. Retrieved 2009-12-02.]
Typically, Gnostic systems are loosely described as being "dualistic" in nature, meaning that they have the view that the world consists of or is explicable as two fundamental entities.



... they run the gamut from the "radical dualist" systems of Manicheanism to the "mitigated dualism" of classic gnostic movements... (Emphasis mine.) (Gnosticism: Dualism and monism)
Chrestos in opening of Mani epistle; site of ancient Kellis, modern-day Ismant el-Kharab, Egypt
Though Mani was raised in a Mesopotamian, baptising tradition and was of Iranian origin, the language of his original Epistle is Syriac:
The Fundamental Epistle, or Epistle of Foundation...was one of the sacred writings of the
Manichaean religion, written by the founder Mani (c. 210–276 CE), originally in Syriac. Since none of the original Syriac writings of Manichaeism remain, we only have translations of small sections of this book, made by either Manichaeans or anti-Manichaeans. (Emphasis mine.) (Fundamental Epistle)
As we see, supra, this Epistle does not mention Jesus Christ, or any Jesus; all the translations are at fault. Mani and Manichaeism are not contemporaneous with Christianity, but Chrestianity; its original language was Syriac, not Greek, Latin, or Iranian.
Social Context
The age of the Gnostics was highly diverse; they seem to have originated in Alexandria and coexisted with the early Christians until the 4th century AD, and because there was as yet no fixed church authority, syncretism with pre-existing belief systems as well as new religions were often embraced. The movement spread in areas controlled by the Roman Empire and Arian Goths, and the Persian Empire; it continued to develop in the Mediterranean and Middle East before and during the 2nd and 3rd centuries. (Emphasis mine.)
Second and third centuries - the same time as the textual tradition for the New Testament begins. My suggestion for Source Q:
Bardaisan...was an Assyrian born on 11 July 154, in Edessa, which, in those days, was alternately under the influence of the Roman and the Parthian Empire. ...when Abgar IX, the friend of his youth, ascended the throne (179) he took his place at court. He was clearly no ascetic, but dressed in finery "with berylls and caftan",[6] according to Ephrem the Syrian. According to tradition, during his youth he shared the education of a royal prince who afterwards became King of Edessa, perhaps Abgar X bar Manu (ruled Osroene 202-217). Perhaps owing to the persecutions under Caracalla, Bardaisan for a time retreated into Armenia... As a gnostic, he certainly denied the resurrection of the body... Porphyry states that on one occasion at Edessa, Bardaisan interviewed an Indian deputation of holy men (designated as Σαρμαναίοι, Sramanas) who had been sent to the Roman emperor Elagabalus or another Severan dynasty Roman Emperor, and questioned them as to the nature of Indian religion. The encounter is described in Porphyry De abstin., iv, 17 [9] and Stobaeus (Eccles., iii, 56, 141) The followers of Bardaisan of Mesopotamia (the Bardaisanites) were a sect of the 2nd century... (Bardaisan)
His seminal role in fathering Manichaeism:
He is the creator of an offshoot of Mesopotamian religion named after his name, which formed the basis of the teachings of the gnostic Mani and later of the gnostic Batini and Ismaili sub-sects of Shia.[Patricia Crone (28 June 2012). The Nativist Prophets of Early Islamic Iran: Rural Revolt and Local Zoroastrianism. Cambridge University Press. pp. 546–220.] (My emphasis.)
Mani began preaching at an early age and was possibly influenced by contemporary BabylonianAramaic movements such as Mandaeanism, and Aramaic translations of Jewish apocalyptic writings similar to those found at Qumran (such as the book of Enoch literature), and by the Syriac dualist-gnostic writer Bardaisan (who lived a generation before Mani). (Manichaeism)
Mani rejected the theology of the baptising cult in which he was raised; he escaped their attack only by the help of his father; he is not Jewish and his Chrest is not a Jewish product, but culturally-Greek. Bardaisan is Arab, not Jewish in any way. Mani, his father and Bardaisan share much and it is not Judaism.



Hellenistic culture in the Indian subcontinent: Greek clothes, amphoras, wine and music (Detail of Chakhil-iGhoundi stupa, Hadda, Gandhara, 1st century CE).
Culture flowed eastwards from Syria to Greco-India (those Iranian eastern satrapies colonised by Alexander and later Greeks; this came to include the northern Subcontinent and much of the Himalayas; culture also flowed the other way.
Buddhism
Athena in the art of Gandhara
The idea that Gnosticism was derived from Buddhism was first proposed by the Victorian gem collector and numismatist Charles William King (1864), but is generally rejected in scholarship. [Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Clare Goodrick-Clarke G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest 2005 p8 "The idea that Gnosticism was derived from Buddhism was first postulated by Charles William King in his classic work, The Gnostics and their Remains (1864). He was one of the earliest and most emphatic scholars to propose the Gnostic debt to Buddhist thought."] Mansel (1875)[H. L. Mansel, Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second Centuries (1875); p.32] considered the principal sources of Gnosticism to be Platonism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism.[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J p490 ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley — 1982 "Mansel ... summed up the principal sources of Gnosticism in these three: Platonism, the Persian religion, and the Buddhism of India."] However, the influence of Buddhism in any sense on either the gnostikos Valentinus (c. 170) or the Nag Hammadi texts (3rd century) is not supported by modern scholarship, but in the latter case



is considered quite possible by Elaine Pagels (1979),[Pagels, Elaine (1979, repr. 1989). The
Gnostic Gospels, p. xxi. New York: Random House.] who called for Buddhist scholars to try to find parallels.[The Eastern Buddhist Society (1981) "This paper is an initial attempt to follow up Pagels' call for a comparative study of the Nag Hammadi tractates and Indian sources,6 by considering some of thesimilarities in theory and practice present in certain Nag Hammadi texts, in certain Buddhist wisdom scriptures, and in the works of two second to third century CE Mahayana Buddhist philosophers, Nagarjuna and Aryadeva."] Also in the 3rd century the Syrian writer and Christian Gnostic theologian Bar Daisan (154–222)
described his exchanges with the religious missions of holy men from India passing through Syriaon their way to Elagabalus or another Severan dynasty Roman Emperor. His accounts were quoted by Porphyry (On Abstinence 4:17) and Stobaeus (Eccles., iii, 56, 141) (Emphasis mine.)
One of the first representations of the Buddha, 1st-2nd century CE, Gandhara, Pakistan: Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum).
Under the Indo-Greeks and then the Kushans, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of Gandhara, in today’s northern Pakistan, before spreading further into India, influencing the art of Mathura, and then the Hindu art of the Gupta empire, which was to extend to the rest of South-East Asia. The influence of Greco-Buddhist art also spread northward towards Central Asia, strongly affecting the art of the Tarim Basin, and ultimately the arts of China, Korea, and Japan.
As Buddha first appears (he would have been resurrected, in stone, much as a pillar of the Church) as Greek and in the first-second century, he probably pre-dates the first appearance of IS Chrest.
Ancient Greek philosophy
...some scholars prefer to speak of "gnosis" when referring to 1st-century ideas that later developed into gnosticism and to reserve the term "gnosticism" for the synthesis of these ideas into a coherent movement in the 2nd century.[R. McL. Wilson, "Nag Hammadi and the New Testament", New Testament Studies, vol. 28, (1982), 292.] Probable influences include Plato, Middle Platonism and Neo-Pythagoreanism academies or schools of thought... (Emphasis mine.)
In this period, what is today termed Greek philosophy is actually the study and practise of Greek Magic; philosophers have become magicians. This begins with Neopythagoreanisn and later, Neoplatonism.
Keith Thomas: "Spiritual magic or theurgy was based on the idea that one could reach God in an ascent up the scale of creation made possible by a rigorous course of prayer, fasting and devotional preparation." Anne Sheppard: "Theurgy, the religious magic practised by the later Neoplatonists, has been commonly regarded as the point at which Neoplatonism degenerates into magic, superstition and irrationalism. A superficial glance at the ancient lives of the Neoplatonists, and in particular at Eunapius' Lives of the Sophists, reveals a group of people interested in animating statues, favoured with visions of gods and demons, and skilled in rain-making" Pierre A. Riffard: "Theurgy is a type of magic. It consists of a set of magical practices performed to evoke beneficent spirits in order to see them or know them or in order to influence them, for instance by forcing



them to animate a statue, to inhabit a human being (such as a medium), or to disclose mysteries." (Theurgy)
Gnosticism and this Greek Magic are closely associated with each other.
Philosophical relations with Neoplatonism
Raising Lazarus using a magic wand. Catacombe de Via Anapo, Rome
Gnostics borrow a great deal of ideas and terms from Platonism. They exhibit a keen
understanding of Greek philosophical terms and the Greek Koine language in general, and use Greek philosophical concepts throughout their text, including such concepts as hypostasis (reality, existence), ousia (essence, substance, being), and demiurge (creator God). Good examples include texts such as the Hypostasis of the Archons (Reality of the Rulers) or Trimorphic Protennoia (The first thought in three forms).
At its core, Gnosticism formed a speculative interest in the relationship of the oneness of God to the ‘triplicity’ of his manifestations. It seems to have takenNeoplatonic metaphysics of substance
and hypostases [“being”] as a departure point for interpreting the relationship of the “Father” to the “Son”[A new theological vocabulary capable of explaining this doctrine was created [e.g. homoousios=same essence]. (Emphasis mine.)
Now we come to the textual tradition of Thomas, which appears to have originated in Syria, probably Edessa:
The Gospel According to Thomas, (or the Gospel of Thomas), is an early Christian non-canonical sayings-gospel that many scholars believe provides insight into the oral gospel traditions. It
was discovered near Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in December 1945 among a group of books known as the Nag Hammadi library. The library consists of fifty-two writings that include an excerpt from Plato's Republic and gospels which state that they were written by Jesus' disciple Philip. The Coptic-language text, the second of seven contained in what modern-day scholars have designated as Codex II, is composed of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus.[2] Almost half of these sayings resemble those found in the Canonical Gospels, while it is speculated that the other sayings were added from Gnostic tradition.[3] Its place of origin may have been Syria, where Thomasine traditions were strong.[4]
The introduction states: "These are the hidden words that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down."[5] Didymus (Greek) and Thomas (Aramaic) both mean
"twin". Some critical scholars suspect that this reference to the Apostle Thomas is false, and that therefore the true author is unknown.[6] It is possible that the document originated within a school of early Christians, possibly protoGnostics.[7] Some critics further state that even the description of Thomas as a "gnostic" gospel is based upon little other than the fact that it was found along with gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi.[8] The name of Thomas was also attached to the Book of Thomas the Contender, which was also in Nag Hammadi Codex II, and the Acts of Thomas. 2. Modern-day scholars have numbered the sayings and even parts of the sayings, but the text contains no numbering. 3.

There is no reliable dating of these, though generally they are considered early.
Thomas was probably not reliant upon the canonical gospels and probably predated them. [Correlation Analysis] Several authors argue that when the logia in Thomas do have parallels in the synoptics, the version in Thomas often seems closer to the source.
These characteristics are the same as the Dura fragment, in that content in both appear in the New Testament. The fragment is certainly at least as old as the early-second century and as per the above observation, Thomas "probably predated" the canonical gospels. Simply put, the canonical gospels post-date the Thomas tradition in Edessa and thus they originate with either Bardaisan, or his School.
This supports my history, which states clearly that the synoptics do not offer a history of Judea in the first century, but are imperial concoctions based on Arab tradition in Edessa.
Christianity
The ancient Nag Hammadi Library, discovered in Egypt in the 1940s, revealed how varied this movement was...The find included the hotly debated Gospel of Thomas, which parallels some of Jesus’ sayings in the Synoptic Gospels. (Emphasis mine.)
Start of the Nag Hammadi Gospel of Thomas: IS the Chrest
We should also consider: Didymus (Greek) and Thomas (Aramaic) both mean "twin". Right: Pair of Roman
statuettes (3rd century CE) depicting the Dioscuri as horsemen, with their characteristic skullcaps (Metropolitan Museum of Art)
The fact that Judas "the Twin" was the apostolic figure particularly revered in Syriac-speaking churches is important evidence for the date and place of composition of the text. For as Koester (in Layton 1989: 39) has shown, Gos. Thom.'s identification of this author as Jesus' brother Judas does not presuppose a knowledge of the NT, but "rests upon an independent tradition." In addition, the peculiar, redundant name Didymus Judas Thomas seems to be attested only in the East, where the shadowy disciple named Thomas (Mark 3:18 par.; John 14:5) or Thomas Didymus (John 11:16; 20:24; 21:2) was identified with Judas in the Syriac NT and called Judas Thomas (John 14:22). The occurrence of variants of this distinctive name in the Acts of Thomas is especially striking, not only because the latter evidently shows acquaintance with Gos. Thom. 2, 13, 22, and 52, but also because it is widely held that the Acts of Thomas was composed in Syriac in the early 3d
century. Other documents that invoke the authority of Judas Thomas by name are also of Syriac origin, such as the Teaching of Addai, the Abgar legend (Eus. Histl. Eccl. 1.13.1-22), and the Book



of Thomas the Contender (NHC II, 7).
Accordingly, the naming of Judas Thomas as the ostensible author of Gos. Thom. serves to locate the likely composition of the text in a bilingual environment in E. Syria. (Ron Cameron argues for the independence of Thomas (op. cit., p. 537), The Gospel of Thomas)
Such divine twins are a recurrent theme in mythology:
The Divine twins are a mytheme of Proto-Indo-European mythology. Examples include the:
Greek Dioscuri
Vedic Ashvins
Hindu Nara-Narayana
Lithuanian Ašvieniai
Latvian Dieva dēli
Sicilian Palici
Germanic deities Alcis
Italian Romulus and Remus
Anglo-Saxon Hengest and Horsa
Similar themesOne recurring element in the divine twin theme is that, while identical, one is divine and the other is human. This points to other characters which partially reflect the mytheme, such as:
Krishna and Arjuna, as Nara-Narayana - a dual incarnation of Vishnu, while not twins but cousins, many of the elements are present
Achilles and Patroclus - not twins
First Man and Son of Man, in the Naassene gnosticism.
Bronze hand used in the worship of Sabazios. Roman 1st-2nd century CE. The Thracian Horseman
Purusha, the cosmic man - very similar to the gnostic First Man, is a primeval giant that is sacrificed by the gods and from whose body the world is built. He is described as having a thousand heads and a thousand feet. He emanated Viraj, the female creative principle, from which he is reborn in turn after the world was made out of his parts. Purusha was dismembered by the devas—his mind is the Moon, his eyes are the Sun, and his breath is the wind. This reminds of the dismemberment mythos, for example that of Like Viraj-Shakti to Purusha, so does Isis recompose the body of Osiris in order to have his offspring, Horus, who then is Osiris' twin.



How and why Edessa/Syriac had such an interest is a topic for another day; meanwhile, I will say that I think this may relate to The Thracian Horseman:
More "rider god" steles are at the Burdur Museum, in Turkey. Under the Roman Emperor Gordian III the god on horseback appears on coins minted at Tlos, in neighboring Lycia, and at Istrus, in the province of Lower Moesia, between Thrace and the Danube. It is generally thought that the young emperor's grandfather came from an Anatolian family, because of his unusual cognomen, Gordianus. The iconic image of the god or hero on horseback battling the chthonic serpent, on which his horse tramples, appears on Celtic votive columns, and with the coming of Christianity it was easily transformed into the image of Saint George and the Dragon, whose earliest known depictions are from tenth- and eleventh-century Cappadocia and eleventh-century Georgia and Armenia.
(Sabazios: God on horseback)
Resurrection, as noted above, is an Egyptian theme, which the Ptolemies made their own, coming to a head with their last, Cleopatra VII. This heralds the birth of IS Chrest and Chrestianity; it is now colonial Greek, as is the culture of Edessa in the early-modern era.

This same culture is anti-Jewish, not despite, but because of its own Hellenistic-Jewish elements, as typified by the family of Alexander the Alabarch:
Tiberius Julius Alexander (fl. 1st century) was an equestrian governor and general in the Roman Empire. Born into a wealthy Jewish family of Alexandria but abandoning or neglecting the Jewish religion, he rose to become procurator of Judea (c. 46 – 48) under Claudius. While Prefect of Egypt (66 – 69), he employed his legions against the Alexandrian Jews in a brutal response to ethnic violence, and was instrumental in the Emperor Vespasian's rise to power. In 70, he participated in the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus' second-in-command.
In his regard, we must note how his brother, Marcus Julius Alexander, traded with India (the Petrie Ostraca, mentions his activities at Myos Hormos and Berenice Troglodytica, ports located in the Red Sea between 37-44).
It is through such Chrestians that we see Gnosticism in Egypt, especially after their destruction of Judea, made complete by Hadrian.
Gnostic rejection of Judaism
Modern research (Cohen 1988) identifies Judaism, rather than Persia, as a major origin of Gnosticism. Many of the Nag Hammadi texts make reference to Judaism, in some cases with a violent rejection of the Jewish God.[20th Century Jewish Religious Thought Arthur A. Cohen, Paul Mendes-Flohr, Arthur Allen Cohen 1988 republished 2010 – Page 286 "Recent research, however, has tended to emphasize that Judaism, rather than Persia, was a major origin of Gnosticism. Indeed, it appears increasingly evident that many of the newly published Gnostic texts were written in a context from which Jews were not absent. In some cases, indeed, a violent rejection of the Jewish God, or of Judaism, seems to stand at the basis of these texts. ...
facie, various trends in Jewish thought and literature of the Second Commonwealth appear to have been potential factors in Gnostic origins.] Gershom Scholem once described Gnosticism as "the Greatest case of metaphysical anti-Semitism".[Gager, John G. (1985-02-14). The origins of antisemitism: attitudes toward Judaism in pagan and Christian antiquity. Oxford University Press. p. 168. ISBN 978-0-19-503607-7.] Professor Steven Bayme said gnosticism would be better characterized as anti-Judaism.[Understanding Jewish History: Texts and Commentaries by Steven Bayme Publisher: Ktav Publishing House] (Emphasis mine.)



Artefacts from Tell Yahoodieh, Egypt
Anti-Judaism was a reason for Chrestianity, too, and this was especially true for those Hellenised Jews who supported Rome in its wars against Judea (as earlier, such had supported Antiochus IV Epiphanes, then fled to Egypt).
When Christianity appears, Classical Antiquity is forgotten, especially the history of Judea in the first century, replaced by the unrecognised parody of the New Testament. Surviving Jews are lumped together and often treated as enemy, with forced conversion and legal; restrictions. The various strands of the modern era are classed as heretical.
The historical roots of Gnosticism can be found deeply embedded across cultures of a wide region, from the duality of Zoroastrianism (day and night, light and dark, good and evil, two spirits), onwards into Egypt, Judea (Iranian dualism has been identified in the Dead Sea Scrolls) and Syria (all ruled at various times by Iran), and in the modern era, it emerged from the Hellenistic and specifically Ptolemaic intelligentsia. If we still could access the archives of the Royal Library of Alexandria, no doubt we would find an interesting history for both Greek Magic and Gnosticism.

Weaving a Chrestian tradition in sea silk - Origins of Christianity
10-13 minutes
If you give some credibility to my evidence-based history (and please do), you'll likely think that Chrestianity disappeared once it became Christian. You should therefore be surprised to learn that just as other religions and cults (such as the Druze) have survived for at least two millennia, remnants of Chrest worship are also found in today's world.
The BBC recently reported on a woman in Sardinia who is expert at weaving sea silk:
The bracelet is made of an ancient thread, known as byssus, which is mentioned on the Rosetta stone and said to have been found in the tombs of pharaohs. Some believe it was the cloth God told Moses to lay on the first altar. It was the finest fabric known to ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome, and one of its remarkable properties is the way it shines when exposed to the sun, once it has been treated with lemon juice and spices. Another is that it is extraordinarily light.
Chiara Vigo: The last woman who makes sea silk
Here comes the religious part:
According to Vigo, the skill was brought to Sant'Antioco by Princess Berenice, greatgranddaughter of the Biblical Herod, Herod the Great, during the second half of the First Century.
Her family remains Jewish, unlike many others in southern Italy and Sardinia who converted to Christianity long ago, but continued to set a table for the Sabbath on Friday evenings well into the 20th Century, without knowing why. According to Gabriel Hagai, professor of Hebrew Codicology at the Ecole Pratique des Haute Etudes in Paris, Vigo is "the last remnant" of a combination of Jewish and Phoenician religious practices that was once far more widespread in the Mediterranean. "I met Chiara through a fellow professor in Paris, and I was sceptical at first," he says. "This craft combined folklore and religion [but] she has allowed us to reconstruct a forgotten and missing part of our history."
Jewish, but not Jewish, a combination of Jewish and Phoenician, a tradition starting with Berenice.
Berenice was a member of the Herodian Dynasty that ruled the Roman province of Judaea between 39 BC and 92 AD. She was the daughter of King Herod Agrippa I and a sister of King Herod Agrippa II. She is also mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles (26:30). After a number of failed marriages throughout the 40s, she spent much of the remainder of her life at the court of her brother Herod Agrippa II, amidst rumors the two were carrying on an incestuous relationship. During the First Jewish-Roman War, she began a love affair with the future emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus.
(Berenice (daughter of Herod Agrippa))
She was an important Chrestian:
Josephus records three short-lived marriages in Berenice's life, the first which took place sometime between 41 and 43, to Marcus Julius Alexander, brother of Tiberius Julius Alexander and son of



Alexander the Alabarch of Alexandria.[4][5] On his early death in 44, she was married to her father's brother, Herod of Chalcis,[3] with whom she had two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus.[6] After her husband died in 48, she lived with her brother Agrippa for several years and then married Polemon II of Pontus, king of Cilicia, whom she subsequently deserted.[7] 4.

The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Ser. (University of Pennsylvania Press) 82 (3/4): 361–381. 6. Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.5.2 7. Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.7.3
The alabarch was the estate manager of Antonia Minor, whose Chrestianity is inscribed; his son Tiberius became the co-commander of Titus during the siege of Jerusalem. Herod of Chalcis is the New Testamental Herod who slew John the Baptiser.
Bust of Berenice (copy), Louvre, Paris
Eisenman on Berenice (also Bernice and Berenike), defining how the religious faith of Saul/Paul is fundamentally different to Judaism:
1. PAUL'S basic attempts to found a community where both Greek and Hebrew — or as he puts it sometimes, "Jews first, but Greeks as well" (cf. Rom 3:22, 1 Cor 12:13, etc.) — enjoy equal promises and privileges, spiritual or otherwise, and consonant soteriological equity, are well documented. This cosmopolitanism is based on a more easy-going attitude towards the Law (as opposed to Qumran's and James' strict constructionist, "not one jot or tittle" approach); the ideal of justification by faith alone (as opposed, for instance, to the insistence in lQpHab 8 upon the Law as a prerequisite for justification); an open hostility to circumcision which undoubtedly found a sympathetic response from such "Asian" rulers as Antiochus of Commagene, Monobazus' mother Helen of the sistering state of Adiabene, Azizus of Emesa, who married Drusilla after he was circumcised only to have her divorce him, and Polemos of Cilicia whom Bernice divorced after he was circumcised (which Josephus tells us he did on account of her great "riches"); and an easygoing approach to dietary matters — as Paul puts it in 1 Cor 9:19ff. in his discussion of the terms of James' "Jerusalem Council" directives, despite his somewhat disingenuous protests about not wishing to be the cause of his brother's "stumbling": "do not be afraid to eat anything sold in the butcher-shops; there is no need to raise questions of conscience" ("conscience" in his view being a euphemism for the Law: cf., his allusion to vegetarianism like James' as "weak"). 2. Aristobulus must be seen as one of the inner circle around Titus (along with Tiberius Alexander, Josephus, Bernice, Agrippa II and others). 3. One of its scions, Tiberius Alexander, who became procurator in Palestine after the death of Herod of Chalcis, was Titus' military commandant at Jerusalem. Josephus, who understood these matters well, specifically called attention to Tiberius' defection from Judaism, as he did to that of Bernice, Titus' mistress. Bernice's second sister Mariamne divorced her first husband in order to marry another son of the Alabarch, presumably the first husband's brother (if he was not of this family, it is another case of Gentile marriage). 4. These divorces are anticipated by the divorce of Herod's sister Salome from the Idumaean Costobarus, so important in all our genealogies and paralleled by similar ones by Mariamne (mentioned above) and Bernice from Polemos of Cilicia to take up with Titus (which would involve her in a two-fold denunciation at Qumran, not to mention her "riches" and the rumor of her illicit connection with Agrippa II which Josephus also mentions relative to the Polemos affair). Paul, too, shows his knowledge of this kind of divorce in discussing James' 'Jerusalem Council' "fornication" directives in 1 Cor 7:10f., but importantly he does not condemn them. Instead, he gently slaps the wrist of the offending woman by recommending that she abstain from further marriage and specifies no further punitive procedures. 5. At one point Paul is pictured as saying to Agrippa in the presence of the fornicator and future apostate Bernice, "I know that you believe." King Agrippa, nothing loath, replies, "a little more and you would have made me a Christian"; then he good-naturedly pronounces the judgment, which via the miracle of art has been assimilated into the portrait of Jesus in the Gospels, "this man has done



nothing to deserve death or imprisonment" (Acts 26:27-32). (Paul as Herodian by Robert Eisenman JHC 3/1 (Spring, 1996), 110-122.)
We may ponder how some traditions eventually wove their way into the New Testament; Saul was later resurrected as Paul by his Marcionite Church and the letters in his spymaster's archive were remade as the Epistles; Berenice had a popular following in the region of Saul's Seven Churches and her son's name, Berenicianus, attracted its own following.
Registration document for four date orchards owned by Babatha
Berenicianus was the last (male) heir of the Herodian dynasty. His daughter was Julia Crispina, who features in the Babatha archive found in the Cave of Letters, near Ein Gedi (named as the home of the Essene movement). This Julia Crispina was in a legal struggle with Babatha regarding a child "Jesus"; I consider this of paramount importance in understanding Roman actions at this time - the third and final Jewish-Roman War in which the Jews were led by a declared messiah (Simon ben Kosiba). That is, it may have been in Crispina's mind to use the child for a Chrestian purpose, adopting him as heir to the throne.
Another document of importance concerns the guardianship of Babatha’s son. In 125 CE, Babatha brought a suit to court against the appointed guardians of her orphaned son, citing their insufficient disbursement of funds. The document contains Babatha’s petition that full guardianship responsibility of her son and his property be transferred to her control.[4] DeathThe latest documents discovered in the pouch concern a summons to appear in an Ein Gedi court as Judah’s first wife, Miriam, had brought a dispute against Babatha regarding their late husband’s property. Therefore, it is assumed that Babatha was near Ein Gedi in 132 CE, placing her in the midst of the Bar Kokhba's revolt. It is likely that Babatha fled with Miriam and her family from the imminent violence of the revolt. Because the documents were never retrieved and because twenty skeletal remains were found nearby, historians have suggested that Babatha perished while taking refuge in the cave.[5] 4. Chiusi, 121. 5. Freund, 201 (Babatha)



Details in Temple of Jupiter-Baal, Heliopolis/Baalbek, Lebanon
By 64 CE the disassembled parts of Phoenicia were annexed by Rome and, by 15 CE were colonies of the Roman Empire with Heliopolis remaining an important pilgrimage site which boasted the grandest religious building (the Temple of Jupiter Baal) in all of the Empire, the ruins of which remain well preserved to this day. (Phoenicia)
The Phoenician connection fits in well, for their religious culture would have suited Chrestians well. I have long been impressed by the role of the Severan dynasty, begun by:
Septimius Severus (11 April 145 – 4 February 211), born in Leptis Magna, Libya and founded by a group of local Berbers (and probably Phoenicians).
His marriage to Julia Domna, hereditary high priestess of the Baal temple in Emesa led to that new, literary genre I sometimes mention, of Greek-style travelling miracle workers (such as Apollonia of Tyana and Thomas). My history identifies this as near the start of the textual tradition which became the New Testament.

Evidence-based history
The orthodox history of this period
is backward looking, interpreting
selective data through the beliefs of
later times. With reliable dating to
establish a secure chronology, the
perspective offered here does the
opposite, following the
development of ideas through the
archaeological record of
successive generations.
We approach the information tabula
rasa, in a scientific manner, with no
prior judgements or biases. The
archaeological record is allowed to
speak for itself as much as
possible. Similarly, expert opinion is
often quoted where appropriate,
linked to the source.
The introduction provides a brief
summary, based on our reading of
the evidences. Excavations are on
going, new artefacts (including
texts) come to light and as we gain
both new technologies and better
methods, so we should expect
more. Though much evidence has
been destroyed over the centuries,
there is good reason to be
optimistic for better, more complete
interpretation in future.

Though I've planned for quite a while to address the so-called Christian Mummies of Egypt, I can no longer trace the images online. The two points I had
intended to make were:
1. Mummification was banned by Christianity, because the rites associated with the Book of the Dead are different.
2. None of the mummies had anything specifically Christian spelled out - the mummies bear the usual abbreviations/symbols misappropriated later by
Christianity (and which I interpret as Chrestian).
A scholarly view:
According to the latest archaeological research in Egyptian necropoleis, mummification continued to be practiced in Egypt in Christian circles as
late as 600 CE. The traditional method went through some adaptations. It is not clear exactly what the process was, but it is known that blocks
of natron were used in non-traditional ways, and that there is no trace of evisceration. The corpses were not bandaged, but they were wrapped
in several shrouds. Sometimes layers of salt were placed under or between the shrouds, and the bodies were often dressed in their everyday
clothes. The process of transformation into this newt ype of mummification was not abrupt, but it developed gradually in the course of the first
centuries of Christianity.The same can be said about other manifestations of funerary practice. In shared burial grounds, the tombs of pagans
and Christians differed little from each other, and especially in the case of funerary offerings, some tombs present an amalgam of pagan and
Christian beliefs.
Here we may mention the offering of amulets, and lamps, or the use of the ‘ankh’, a symbol which was soon adapted as the sign of the cross by
the Christians.

But now, the issue is forced upon us, by this announcement:
Mummy Mask May Reveal Oldest Known Gospel
by Owen Jarus, Live Science Contributor | January 18, 2015
A text that may be the oldest copy of a gospel known to exist — a fragment of the Gospel of Mark that was written during the first century,
before the year 90 — is set to be published...
This first-century gospel fragment was written on a sheet of papyrus that was later reused to create a mask that was worn by a mummy...
Evans says that the text was dated through a combination of carbon-14 dating, studying the handwriting on the fragment and studying the other
documents found along with the gospel. These considerations led the researchers to conclude that the fragment was written before the year 90.
If this date is correct, then my suggestion of Bardaisan as source Q would be wrong. Instead, it would suggest how the usually mis-termed Christology of Philo
produced a 'messiah' closer to his time than I knew previously. That may be, only he would be Chrest rather than Christ, though both are in parody.
Bar Kokhba silver Shekel/tetradrachm. Obverse: the Jewish Temple facade with the rising star, surrounded by "Shimon". Reverse: A lulav and etrog, the text reads: "to the freedom of Jerusalem".
Circa 132–136 CE
(A final note on a putative 1st-century divine messiah written up in gospel form: as these stories use the chronicles of Josephus for verisimilitude and he died
ca 100, is it not rather unlikely how he - or one of the other historians - did not provide a detailed history of both this divine man and his movement through
to the end of that period? Or object to the satires known as the gospels? Remember, the Roman army, as well as both the Roman elite and Herodian monarchy
- and thus the entire literati in the Roman world - knew what had actually happened in Judea even without Josephus to remind them, so the gospels-as
history could not have fooled the educated. If Josephus had read them, I imagine he might have choked to death. Anyway, the only Jewish messiah in
recorded history had yet to be so named: Simon ben Kosiba.)
However, before anyone jumps to a premature conclusion, let's have full disclosure of what is being found.
From the fragments I've seen, there is still no mention of Jesus Christ, Christianity, or Christians - just the usual abbreviations which I interpret as Chrestian.
As for the dating, expect every attempt to get them into the 1st century - that's what the Christian apologists do and by any means.

Romanisation - Origins of Christianity
6-8 minutes
But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. (Luke 19:27)
Just as the conquests of Alexander the Great led to Hellenisation of conquered peoples and their cultures, where local religions and their deities became syncretised with the Greek, so the Roman Empire did more than impose its own rule and culture upon subject nations. In the eastern Mediterranean, including Egypt, Rome syncretised its religious beliefs and deities with those already syncretised with the Greek.
Syncretism is the combining of different, often seemingly contradictory beliefs, while melding practices of various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merger and analogizing of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. (Syncretism)
This was an old, established practise and one might say: this was the point of empire, compared with plain conquest.
Syncretic gods of the Hellenistic period found also wide favor in Rome: Serapis, Isis and Mithras, for example. Cybele as worshipped in Rome essentially represented a syncretic East Mediterranean goddess. The Romans imported the Greek god Dionysus into Rome, where he merged with the Latin mead god Liber, and converted the Anatolian Sabazios into the Roman Sabazius.
The degree of correspondence varied: Jupiter makes perhaps a better match for Zeus than the rural huntress Diana does for the feared Artemis. Ares does not quite match Mars. The Romans physically imported the Anatolian goddess Cybele into Rome from her Anatolian cultcenter Pessinos in the form of her original aniconic archaic stone idol; they identified her as Magna Mater and gave her a matronly, iconic image developed in Hellenistic Pergamum. (Syncretism: Roman World)
Our modern term for divinity and the divine derives from the Latin deus, from the Greek god Zeus:
Deus is Latin for "god" or "deity". Latin deus and dīvus "divine", are descended from Proto-IndoEuropean *deiwos, from the same root as *Dyēus, the reconstructed chief god of the Proto-IndoEuropean pantheon. Compare Greek Zeus (Ζεύςzdeús; Aeolic Greek Δεύς deús) and Sanskrit देव deva.
In Classical Latin, deus (feminine dea) was a general noun referring to a deity, while in technical usage a divus or diva was a figure who had become divine, such as a divinized emperor. In Late Latin, Deus came to be used mostly of the Christian God. (Deus)



The Romans regarded Jupiter as the equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and in Latin literature and Roman art, the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name Iuppiter. (Jupiter (mythology))
We therefore see that although Christianity claims inheritance from Judaism, that the Christian God is Yahweh, it is in fact Jupiter, syncretised with Zeus.
These lamented those that were put to death by Herod, because they had cut down the golden eagle that had been over the gate of the temple. (Josephus "Ant." xvii. 6, § 2)
Rome did not, as a general rule, have an interest in privately-held belief, as long as it did not interfere with good public order, or undermine the authority of the state. Thus, imperial authority banned self-castration, a part of the Cybeline cult introduced to Rome from Phrygia, and demanded that Jews recognise the emperor as the ultimate, highest authority, rather than Jewish law - and it is this that brought Judea and Rome to conflict.
As long as Judea was ruled by the Herodian dynasty, which had become Hellenised, then Romanised, the imperial Roman court felt secure in its authority, but as Messianic Judaism gained ground, some - particularly the Chrestian elite in Judea and the Levant - saw the possibility of a different, nationalist King of the Jews as a threat to their own, superior position, and used their imperial connections to bring about a direct confrontation. The three Jewish-Roman Wars were the immediate result, along with the destruction of the (Second) Temple and the form of Judaism practised there. It is in this context that the New Testament was created, then adapted and in its final form become the platform for continued imperial rule.
The emperor Hadrian demolished what remained of Jerusalem after the First Jewish-Roman War and over-built with Aelia Capitolina, placing the temple of Jupiter atop the (Second) Temple foundations:
(Hadrian) then decided to rebuild the city as a Roman colony which would be inhabited by his legionnaires. Hadrian's new plans included temples to the major regional deities, and certain Roman gods, in particular Jupiter Capitolinus.
Aelia came from Hadrian's nomen gentile, Aelius, while Capitolina meant that the new city was dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus, to whom a temple was built on the site of the former Jewish temple, the Temple Mount. The city was without walls, protected by a light garrison of the Tenth Legion, during the Late Roman Period. The detachment at Jerusalem, which apparently encamped all over the city’s western hill, was responsible for preventing Jews from returning to the city. (Aelia Capitolina)



This instigated the Third (and final) Jewish-Roman War, a holocaust, and the legendary man who executed Hadrian's orders in these regards was appropriately given the name - and constellation - Aquila.
Epiphanius (De Ponderibus et Mensuris, chap. xiii-xvi.; ed. Migne, ii. 259-264) preserves a tradition that he was a kinsman of the Emperor Hadrian, who employed him in rebuilding Jerusalem (as Aelia Capitolina), and that Aquila was converted to Christianity but, on being reproved for practicing astrology, 'apostatized' to Judaism. He is said also to have been a disciple of Rabbi Aqiba (d. ca. 132 CE).
In Jewish writings he is referred to as עקילס (Aquilas), although he is also known by its Hebrew corruption, Onkelos. (Aquila of Sinope)
Onkelos is mentioned several times in the Talmud. According to the traditional Jewish sources, he was a prominent Roman nobleman, a nephew of the Roman emperor Titus. (Onkelos)
The symbol of Zeus becomes that of the imperial Roman legions, and as Zeus becomes Deus, so this eagle became the potent symbol of Christianity.

Introduction
A characteristic of the textual tradition is how it glorifies, sanctifies even, those useful to its cause, and this woman belongs to both categories - vastly important in imperial, political intrigue, responsible for Romanising the children of provincial royalty, and one of the leading Chrestians in Rome.
Antonia is one of the most prominent Roman women. She is celebrated for her virtue and beauty.
Her history is thought to be, broadly, well-documented, though this inscription (epitaph CIL VI 24944) dedicated to the "Gods of the Underworld" undermines such a claim to some extent. The scholarly consensus has always agreed that this refers to Antonia Minor and her husband Drusus, and that it describes her as a Chrestian, though as with all theological scholarship in that regard, they don't seem to know what this means.
Her son Germanicus died in 19 CE; on the orders of Tiberius and Livia Drusilla, Antonia was forbidden to go to his funeral. When Livia Drusilla died in June 29CE, Antonia took care of:
Caligula, Julia Agrippina, Julia Drusilla, Julia Livilla and later



Claudia Antonia and her younger grandchildren.
Covert Chrestianity
The giving and holding of hostages was an important part of imperial policy towards both foreign nations and its own provinces. Imperial policy also included Romanisation, also towards both captured peoples and neighbours. The emperor Augustus gave Antonia Minor the role of raising provincial royalty in a fit manner. Generally speaking, this can be described as Romnisation, though as explained here, this involved more than learning Latin and how to look like a Roman; it contained the theological as well: the imperial cult and the Religio Romana as two examples.
She would not have worked as a tutor - Roman families used Greek slaves for this. Looking at her slaves who became freedmen, we see such Greeks as Felix, who went on to become Procurator of Judea. His actions managed to get him into both the chronicles of Josephus and the New Testament.
Her authority came from her status, enhanced by her not remarrying, and from Augustus, founder of the empire. In later centuries, as emperors looked back to Augustus for inspiration, they also saw her and this alone would have ensured credibility for her values and belief.
She was the focus loci for Chrestianity, with Alexander the Alabarch her agent in Alexandria (with control over the grain supply to Italy and money to buy support in Jerusalem) and his brother, Philo, producing a syncretic philosophy; Felix her agent in Judea; Epaphroditus the senior chamberlain, in effect prime minister of the empire; her freed slave becoming common-law wife to Vespasian and step-mother to Titus.
Her interest was in maintaining imperial control of the Levant, from Asia Minor, through Syria and Judea, to Egypt and across North Africa. Her Chrestianised child hostages returned home to become the next generation of rulers in the imperial provinces. The primary threat she needed to counter was the insurrection always brewing in Judea:

Rome needed Judean revenues. Observant Jews across the world - and along the Silk Road Jewish merchants and workshops reweaving silk became rich - sent a tithe each year to the Temple in Jerusalem, built by Herod I and managed by officials appointed by the Herodian monarchy. Once the Temple was destroyed in the First Jewish-Roman War, this had to be replaced by a Roman tax.
As importantly, Judea under Herod Agrippa I and in alliance with the messianic movement, was expanding its influence across the region. Kings were being converted to Judaism, Jewish fighters were appearing in Mesopotamia and taking control, Adiabene (Helen and Izates) poured money into Judea, and there was talk of the king building defences such as raising the wall around Jerusalem. Along with the periodic eruptions of violence and the ever-present fear of the Sicarii, Roman clients in the Levant would have questioned the value of imperial protection.
After Augustus and the passing of Antonia Minor, the emperors do not have appeared to have been overly concerned with Judea, though that is not true for those of Greco-Roman culture in the region, as we see in the Greek-Jewish riots. Both Philo (brother of Antonia Minor's estate manager) and Josephus went to Rome as "ambassadors" for their Jewish communities; that Josephus met privately Poppaea Sabina, wife of Nero and almost certainly a closet Chrestian, indicates that both were already Chrestian, probably under the control of Epaphroditus.
From the reaction of Nero - Saul was sent for interrogation by him at Corinth and disappeared; he is said to kicked Poppaea Sabina to death - Christianity at least in imperial circles - seems to have been covert in this period.
Foreign Hostages
The following taken directly from my notes:



Cleopatra Selene
Caesar installed Cleopatra VII as ruler of Egypt and entered a 14-year relationship with her. After his assassination on the Ides of March 44 BCE, Mark Antony married Cleopatra, sparking a civil war. Their only daughter, Cleopatra Selene II, was the fraternal twin of Ptolemaic prince Alexander Helios - together being the sun and the moon; these twins also had a brother,Ptolemy Philadelphus. Of Greek and Roman heritage. Cleopatra Selene was born, raised and educated in Alexandria. In late 34 BCE, during the Donations of Alexandria, she was made ruler of Cyrenaica and Libya (Roller, pp. 76–81).
Her parents were defeated by Octavian (future Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus) during the naval battle at Actium in 31 BCE. The next year, her parents committed suicide as Octavian and his army invaded Egypt. Octavian celebrated his military triumph in Rome, by parading the three orphans in heavy golden chains in the streets of Rome. The chains were so heavy, they couldn’t walk. (Cassius Dio, Roman History 51.21.8 - who only says that Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene participated in the triumph, but does not mention Ptolemy Philadelphus).
The three siblings were taken by Octavian and given to his sister (and fourth wife of Mark Antony) Octavia Minor to be raised in her house in Rome. (Plutarch, Antony 87.1; Cassius Dio, Roman History 51.15.6; Suetonius, Augustus 17.5)
The last mention of Alexander and Ptolemy Philadelphus comes from Cassius Dio, who states that when their sister Cleopatra Selene married King Juba of Mauretania, Octavian (then named Augustus) spared the lives of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus as a favour to the couple.(Cassius Dio, li. 15)
This Cleopatra married African King Juba II of Numidia, a Berber.
Juba II was descended from a long line of distinguished ancestors who had been involved in Roman politics for nearly two hundred years prior to his accession to the throne of Mauretania. The family tree can be constructed for at least seven generations before Juba, starting with the tribal chieftain Zilalsan, born perhaps around 300BC. The family was famous and talented, producing a variety of scholars and political and cultural leaders, attached first to Carthaginian interests and then to Roman, with an increasing amount of Hellenism. This impressive ancestry was certainly a factor in Caesar’s decision to save young Juba, and that of Augustus to make him king of Mauretania.
- Duane W. Roller, The World of Juda II and Kleopatra Selene
The people of Numidia disapproved of their king being too romanised. In response, Augustus divided the Numidian Kingdom into two: one half he joined to the Roman province of Africa Nova; the other - Western Numidia and Mauretania - became one kingdom. The Phoenician city of Jol was renamed Caesarea and became the capital of this new Roman province of Mauretania, with Juba as king and Cleopatra Selene as queen.
Juba and Cleopatra moved to the security of Caesarea and Mauretania became one of the important client kingdoms in the Roman Empire, with Juba and Cleopatra one of the most loyal client monarchies to serve Rome.



Juba and Cleopatra rebuilt Caesarea in the grand, Roman manner. The monarchs were buried in their mausoleum, which can still be seen.
Gaius Julius Antiochus IV
Epiphanes (Greek: Γάιος Ἰούλιος Ἀντίοχος ὀ Ἐπιφανής, before 17 CE – after 72 CE) was the last king of Commagene, who reigned between 38-72 as a client king to the Roman Empire.
Antiochus appears to have been very young when in 17, his father died. Roman Emperor Tiberius agreed with the citizens of Commagene to make their kingdom apart of the Roman province of Syria. Between 17 and 38, Antiochus seems to have gained Roman citizenship. He lived and was raised in Rome, along with his sister. While he and his sister were growing up in Rome, they were part of the remarkable court of Antonia Minor, a niece of the first Roman Emperor Augustusand the youngest daughter of triumvir Mark Antony. Antonia Minor was a very influential woman and supervised her circle of various princes and princesses. Her circle assisted in the political preservation of the Roman Empire’s borders and affairs of the client states.
In 38, Antiochus received his paternal dominion from Antonia’s grandson, the Roman Emperor Caligula. In addition, the emperor enlarged Antiochus' territory with a part of Cilicia bordering on the seacoast. Caligula also gave him the whole amount of the revenues of Commagene during the twenty years that it had been a Roman province.[2][3] The reasons for providing a client king with such vast resources remain unclear; it was perhaps a stroke of Caligula's well-attested eccentricity. Antiochus was on most intimate terms with Caligula, and he and King Agrippa I are spoken of as the instructors of the emperor in the art of tyranny.[4] This friendship, however, did not last very long, for he was subsequently deposed by Caligula.
Antiochus did not obtain his kingdom again till the accession of Roman Emperor Claudius in 41.
Julia Iotapa
(before 17-around 52) was a princess of Commagene who lived in the 1st century. She was the daughter of the late King Antiochus III of Commagene and Queen Iotapa of Commagene. Her parents were full-blooded siblings who had married each other. She was the sister of later King Antiochus IV of Commagene. Through her ancestor from Commagene, Queen Laodice VII Thea, who was the mother of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene, she was a direct descendant of the Greek Syrian Kingdom the Seleucid Empire.
Iotapa and her brother appeared to be very young, when their father died in 17. Roman Emperor Tiberius agreed with the citizens of Commagene to make their Kingdom apart of the Roman province of Syria. From 17 until 38, Iotapa seems that she had gain Roman citizenship. Iotapa would have put the Latin name Julia, as apart of her name. She had lived and was raised in Rome, along with her brother. While Iotapa and Antiochus were growing up in Rome, they were apart of the remarkable court of Antonia Minor. Antonia Minor was a niece of the first Roman Emperor Augustus and the youngest daughter of triumvir Mark Antony. Antonia Minor was a very influential woman and supervised her circle of various princes and princesses. Her circle assisted in the political preservation of the Roman Empire’s borders and affairs of the client states.
The Roman Emperor Caligula returned to her and Antiochus IV their paternal dominion in 38. In addition, the emperor even enlarged their territory with apart ofCilicia bordering on the seacoast. Caligula also gave them one million gold pieces the whole amount of the revenues of Commagene during the twenty years that it had been under a Roman province. The reasons for providing a client kingdom with such vast resources remain unclear; it was perhaps a stroke of Caligula's well-attested eccentricity.
Iotapa had married her brother and became Roman Client Monarchs of Commagene. Iotapa and Antiochus IV had three children:
Son and prince: Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes. Through him they would become paternal grandparents to Philopappos who was a prominent citizen of Athens and poet Julia Balbilla.
Son and prince: Callinicus
Daughter and princess: Iotapa (see below)
She appeared to have died before Commagene was annexed by Roman Emperor Vespasian in 72. When she died, Antiochus IV in her honor founded a town called Iotape (modern Aytap, Turkey). On coinage her royal title is ‘Queen Iotape Philadelphus’ or ‘ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΑ ΙΩΤΑΠΗ ΦΙΛΑΔΕΛΦΟΣ’. The titlePhiladelphus reveals to us that she is the sister-wife of Antiochus IV. This also shows her descent and claim to the Royal Cult that was established by her late ancestor Antiochus I.
Antonia Tryphaena also known as Tryphaena of Thrace or Tryphaena (her name in Greek: η Άντωνία Τρύφαινα orΤρυφαίνη, 10 BC - 55) was a Princess of Pontus and a Roman Client Queen of Thrace. While Tryphaena’s



children were growing up they were part of the remarkable court of Antonia Minor in Rome. Antonia Minor was another great maternal aunt of Tryphaena’s.
Tryphaena’s brother Polemon II:
When his mother died in 38, Polemon succeeded his mother as the sole ruler of Pontus, Colchis and Cilicia.
Around 50, Polemon was attracted to the wealth and beauty of the Judean princess Julia Berenice, whom he had met in Tiberias during a visit to King Agrippa I. Berenice in turn wanted to marry Polemon II to end rumors that she and her brother were committing incest. Berenice was previously widowed in 48 when her second husband, her paternal uncle Herod of Chalcis, died. She had two sons by him, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus. Berenice however set the condition that Polemon had to convert to Judaism, which included undergoing the rite of circumcision, before marriage. Polemon assented, and the marriage went ahead. It did not last long however, and Berenice left Pontus with her sons and returned to the court of her brother. Polemon abandoned Judaism and, according to the legend of Bartholomew the Apostle, he accepted Christianity, but only to become a pagan again.
Polemon renamed the town Fanizan and named the town after himself to Polemonium (modern Fatsa Turkey). In 62, Nero induced Polemon to abdicate the Pontian throne, and Pontus, including Colchis, became a Roman province. From then until his death, Polemon only ruled Cilicia. Polemon never remarried and had no children.
Tryphaena is associated with the life of the Saint Thecla, the Acts of Paul and Thecla and Saint Tryphaena of Cyzicus. Saint Tryphaena is the patron saint of Cyzicus and she was named in honor of Tryphaena.
Through the preachings of Saint Paul, Tryphaena may have converted to Christianity. In Romans 16:12, in the New Testament of the Bible, Paul sends his greeting to a ‘Tryphaena’ and then the apostle writes about her ’who works in the Lord’s service’.
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
Tryphaena bore Cotys four known children:
Rhoemetalces II
- Rhoemetalces was named after his paternal grandfather and ruled with Tryphaena from when his father died in 18 until his death in 38. Rhoemetalces ruled Thrace with his mother as one kingdom and served as a loyal Roman client ruler, even in 26 putting down Thracian malcontents for the Roman Emperor Tiberius. On coinage his Royal title is ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΡΟΙΜΗΤΑΛΚΑΣ or King Rhoemetalces. Rhoemetalces never married and had no children.
Gepaepyris
she married the Roman Client King Tiberius Julius Aspurgus of the Bosporan Kingdom. Gepaepyris bore Aspurgus, two sons who were Tiberius Julius Mithridates and Tiberius Julius Cotys I. Mithridates and Cotys are the only known grandchildren of Tryphaena and her husband.
Cotys IX
he was the namesake of his father. He became Roman Client King of Lesser Armenia from 38 to until at least 47.
Pythodoris II
or Pythodorida II. She was named after her maternal grandparents and her paternal grandmother. In 38, after the death of Rhoemetalces II, Tryphaena abdicated the throne at the request of Caligula. Caligula put on the Thracian throne Rhoemetalces III as king, the first paternal cousin of her late father’s. Caligula and Tryphaena arranged for Pythodoris II to marry Rhoemetalces III. The marriage between Pythodoris II and Rhoemetalces III was to repair past dynastic misfortunes. Pythodoris II and Rhoemetalces III became the new Roman Client Rulers of Thrace from 38 until 46, when Rhoemetalces III was murdered by insurgents or on the orders of his wife. Pythodoris and Rhoemetalces were the last monarchs of Thrace and then under Claudius, Thrace became a Roman province. The fate of Pythodoris II afterwards is unknown and she seems not to have any children with her paternal cousin.
Ptolemy of Mauretania
sometimes known as Ptolemy of Morocco (Greek:Πτολεμαῖος, Latin: Ptolemaeus, 1 BC-40) was a prince and the last Roman Client King of Mauretania.



Ptolemy was sent to Rome by his parents to be educated. Through his parents, Ptolemy had Roman citizenship. His mother died in 6 and was placed in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania, which by built by his parents. In Rome, Ptolemy was well educated, received a Roman education and became Romanized. During his years living in Rome, Ptolemy was a part of the remarkable court of Antonia Minor.
Antonia Minor was a maternal aunt to Ptolemy who was a half-sister to his late mother. Cleopatra Selene II and Antonia Minor shared the same father but their mothers were different. Her circle assisted in the political preservation of the Roman Empire’s borders and affairs of the client states. Ptolemy lived in Rome until 21 and left Rome to return to Mauretania to the court of his aging father.
Marcus Julius Agrippa I
Agrippa I also called the Great (10 BC - 44 AD), King of the Jews, was the grandson of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus IV andBerenice.[1] His original name was Marcus Julius Agrippa, and he is the king named Herod in the Acts of the Apostles, in the Bible, "Herod (Agrippa)" (Ἡρώδης Ἀγρίππας). He was, according to Josephus, known in his time as "Agrippa the Great"
Josephus informs us that, after the murder of his father, young Agrippa was sent by Herod the Great to the imperial court inRome. There, Tiberius conceived a great affection for him, and had him educated alongside his son Drusus, who also befriended him, and future emperor Claudius.[1] On the death of Drusus, Agrippa, who had been recklessly extravagant and was deeply in debt, was obliged to leave Rome, fleeing to the fortress of Malatha in Idumaea. There, it was said, he contemplated suicide.
1. A LITTLE before the death of Herod the king, Agrippa lived at Rome, and was generally brought up and conversed with Drusus, the emperor Tiberius's son, and contracted a friendship with Antonia, the wife of Drusus the Great, who had his mother Bernice in great esteem, and was very desirous of advancing her son. Now as Agrippa was by nature magnanimous and generous in the presents he made, while his mother was alive, this inclination of his mind did not appear, that he might be able to avoid her anger for such his extravagance; but when Bernice was dead, and he was left to his own conduct, he spent a great deal extravagantly in his daily way of living, and a great deal in the immoderate presents he made, and those chiefly among Caesar's freed-men, in order to gain their assistance, insomuch that he was, in a little time, reduced to poverty, and could not live at Rome any longer. Tiberius also forbade the friends of his deceased son to come into his sight, because on seeing them he should be put in mind of his son, and his grief would thereby be revived.
So Marsyas desired of Peter, who was the freed-man of Bernice, Agrippa's mother, and by the right of her testament was bequeathed to Antonia, to lend so much upon Agrippa's own bond and security; but he accused Agrippa of having defrauded him of certain sums of money, and so obliged Marsyas, when he made the bond of twenty thousand Attic drachmae, to accept of twenty-five hundred drachma as (18) less than what he desired, which the other allowed of, because he could not help it.
4. And now Agrippa was come to Puteoli, whence he wrote a letter to Tiberius Caesar, who then lived at Capreae, and told him that he was come so far in order to wait on him, and to pay him a visit; and desired that he would give him leave to come over to Caprein: so Tiberius made no difficulty, but wrote to him in an obliging way in other respects; and withal told him he was glad of his safe return, and desired him to come to Capreae; and when he was come, he did not fail to treat him as kindly as he had promised him in his letter to do. But the next day came a letter to Caesar from Herennius Capito, to inform him that Agrippa had borrowed three hundred thousand drachmae, and not pad it at the time appointed; but when it was demanded of him, he ran away like a fugitive, out of the places under his government, and put it out of his power to get the money of him. When Caesar had read this letter, he was much troubled at it, and gave order that Agrippa should be excluded from his presence until he had paid that debt: upon which he was no way daunted at Caesar's anger, but entreated Antonia, the mother of Germanicus, and of Claudius, who was afterward Caesar himself, to lend him those three hundred thousand drachmae, that he might not be deprived of Tiberius's friendship; so, out of regard to the memory of Bernice his mother, (for those two women were very familiar with one another,) and out of regard to his and Claudius's education together, she lent him the money; and, upon the payment of this debt, there was nothing to hinder Tiberius's friendship to him. After this, Tiberius Caesar recommended to him his grandson, (20) and ordered that he should always accompany him when he went abroad. But upon Agrippa's kind reception by Antonia, he betook him to pay his respects to Caius, who was her grandson, and in very high reputation by reason of the good-will they bare his father. Now there was one Thallus, a freed-man of Caesar, of whom he borrowed a million of drachmae, and thence repaid Antonia the debt he owed her; and by sending the overplus in paying his court to Caius, became a person of great authority with him.
6. On this account it was that Eutychus could not obtain a bearing, but was kept still in prison. However, some time afterward, Tiberius came from Capreae to Tusculanum, which is about a hundred furlongs from Rome. Agrippa then desired of Antonia that she would procure a hearing for Eutychus, let the matter whereof he accused him prove what it would. Now Antonia was greatly esteemed by Tiberius on all accounts, from the dignity of her relation to him, who had been his brother Drusus's wife, and from her eminent chastity; (21) for though she was still a young woman, she continued in her widowhood, and refused all other matches, although Augustus had enjoined her to be married to somebody else; yet did she all along preserve her reputation free



from reproach. She had also been the greatest benefactress to Tiberius, when there was a very dangerous plot laid against him by Sejanus, a man who had been her husband's friend, and wire had the greatest authority, because he was general of the army, and when many members of the senate and many of the freed-men joined with him, and the soldiery was corrupted, and the plot was come to a great height. Now Sejanus had certainly gained his point, had not Antonia's boldness been more wisely conducted than Sejanus's malice; for when she had discovered his designs against Tiberius, she wrote him an exact account of the whole, and gave the letter to Pallas*, the most faithful of her servants, and sent him to Caprere to Tiberius, who, when he understood it, slew Sejanus and his confederates; so that Tiberius, who had her in great esteem before, now looked upon her with still greater respect, and depended upon her in all things. So when Tiberius was desired by this Antonia to examine Eutychus, he answered, "If indeed Eutychus hath falsely accused Agrippa in what he hath said of him, he hath had sufficient punishment by what I have done to him already; but if, upon examination, the accusation appears to be true, let Agrippa have a care, lest, out of desire of punishing his freed-man, he do not rather bring a punishment upon himself." Now when Antonia told Agrippa of this, he was still much more pressing that the matter might be examined into; so Antonia, upon Agrippa's lying hard at her continually to beg this favor, took the following opportunity: As Tiberius lay once at his ease upon his sedan, and was carried about, and Caius, her grandson, and Agrippa, were before him after dinner she walked by the sedan, and desired him to call Eutychus, and have him examined; to which he replied, "O Antonia! the gods are my witnesses that I am induced to do what I am going to do, not by my own inclination, but because I am forced to it by thy prayers." When he had said this, he ordered Macro, who succeeded Sejanus, to bring Eutychus to him; accordingly, without any delay, he was brought. Then Tiberius asked him what he had to say against a man who had given him his liberty. Upon which he said, "O my lord! this Caius, and Agrippa with him, were once riding in a chariot, when I sat at their feet, and, among other discourses that passed, Agrippa said to Caius, Oh that the day would once come when this old fellow will dies and name thee for the governor of the habitable earth! for then this Tiberius, his grandson, would be no hinderance, but would be taken off by thee, and that earth would be happy, and I happy also." Now Tiberius took these to be truly Agrippa's words, and bearing a grudge withal at Agrippa, because, when he had commanded him to pay his respects to Tiberius, his grandson, and the son of Drusus, Agrippa had not paid him that respect, but had disobeyed his commands, and transferred all his regard to Caius; he said to Macro, "Bind this man." But Macro, not distinctly knowing which of them it was whom he bid him bind, and not expecting that he would have any such thing done to Agrippa, he forbore, and came to ask more distinctly what it was that he said. But when Caesar had gone round the hippodrome, he found Agrippa standing: "For certain," said he, "Macro, this is the man I meant to have bound;" and when he still asked, "Which of these is to be bound?" he said "Agrippa." Upon which Agrippa betook himself to make supplication for himself, putting him in mind of his son, with whom he was brought up, and of Tiberius [his grandson] whom he had educated; but all to no purpose; for they led him about bound even in his purple garments. It was also very hot weather, and they had but little wine to their meal, so that he was very thirsty; he was also in a sort of agony, and took this treatment of him heinously: as he therefore saw one of Caius's slaves, whose name was Thaumastus, carrying some water in a vessel, he desired that he would let him drink; so the servant gave him some water to drink, and he drank heartily, and said, "O thou boy! this service of thine to me will be for thy advantage; for if I once get clear of these my bonds, I will soon procure thee thy freedom of Caius who has not been wanting to minister to me now I am in bonds, in the same manner as when I was in my former state and dignity." Nor did he deceive him in what he promised him, but made him amends for what he had now done; for when afterward Agrippa was come to the kingdom, he took particular care of Thaumastus, and got him his liberty from Caius, and made him the steward over his own estate; and when he died, he left him to Agrippa his son, and to Bernice his daughter, to minister to them in the same capacity. The man also grew old in that honorable post, and therein died. But all this happened a good while later.
Now, as soon as Caius was come to Rome, and had brought Tiberius's dead body with him, and had made a sumptuous funeral for him, according to the laws of his country, he was much disposed to set Agrippa at liberty that very day; but Antonia hindered him, not out of any ill-will to the prisoner, but out of regard to decency in Caius, lest that should make men believe that he received the death of Tiberius with pleasure, when he loosed one whom he had bound immediately. However, there did not many days pass ere he sent for him to his house, and had him shaved, and made him change his raiment; after which he put a diadem upon his head, and appointed him to be king of the tetrarchy of Philip. He also gave him the tetrarchy of Lysanias, (27) and changed his iron chain for a golden one of equal weight. He also sent Marullus to be procurator of Judea.
- Antiquities of the Jews - Book XVIII, CHAPTER 6.
Freed slaves
The freed slaves of Antonia Minor also had important roles; also from my notes:
Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix (22–62) was one of the lesser known figures of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome. His grandmother was Antonia Major, the niece of Emperor Augustus by her husband Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC) (his maternal grandfather). His mother was Domitia Lepida, a great niece of Emperor Augustus and granddaughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. His father was Faustus (II) Cornelius Sulla (see also Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus III), suffect consul of 31 and a descendant of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. He was also the half brother of the empress Valeria Messalina.
In 47, Felix's mother's cousin, the emperor Claudius arranged for Faustus to marry his daughter, Claudia Antonia. They had a son, reportedly a weak child of little strength who died before his second birthday. His son's



first birthday was celebrated privately. His attachment to the imperial ruling family meant that he was awarded a consulship in 52.
In 56, two years after the accession of Nero, the imperial freedman Pallas and the Praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus were accused of conspiring to have Faustus declared emperor. The conspirators were put on trial, but Faustus does not appear to have been implicated. Nero, however, began to watch his brother-in-law closely, afraid of his connection to the imperial family.
In 58, another imperial freedman falsely accused Faustus of plotting to attack Nero, possibly at the latter's instigation. Nero treated Faustus as proven guilty. Faustus was exiled in 59 and confined to Massilia (modern Marseille, France).
Finally, in 62, the palace guardsman Tigellinus sent assassins to murder Faustus. He was murdered at dinner, five days after Tigellinus gave his orders. Faustus' head was transported to the palace. At times, Nero would tease Faustus's head, due to his baldness and greyness to his hair.
Tacitus described Faustus's character as "timid and despicable" and also stated that Faustus was incapable to attempt to plot against Nero.
This must relate to:
Tiberius Claudius Epaphroditus
(to which Augusti libertus ("freedman of the emperor") could be added); mentioned as apparitor Caesarum; as viator tribunicius he served the emperor; as a libellis he drafted Nero's replies to petitions; mentioned by Josephus as his patron in the Jewish Antiquities, his Autobiography, and Against the Greeks.
It was probably at this stage in his career, in 65, that Epaphroditus learned that a senator named Gaius Calpurnius Piso and many others had organized a coup. Epaphroditus immediately reported it to the emperor and the conspirators were arrested. In this context, the Roman historian Tacitus calls Epaphroditus "Nero's freedman", which does not exclude the possibility that he had not obtained the office of a libellis yet, and reached this position as a reward for saving the emperor's life. On the other hand, the fact that he could decisively intervene suggests that he was already a man of great importance.
After the execution of the conspirators, Epaphroditus received military honors. He was now a wealthy man and owned large gardens on the Esquiline hill, east of the Domus Aurea ("golden house"), which Nero had started to construct after the great fire that had destroyed Rome in 64.
Keeping a low profile, he survived the fall of Nero and the brief reigns of Galba (68-69), Otho (first half 69), and Vitellius (second half of 69). The last-mentioned started to put an end to the influence of freedmen on the imperial bureaucracy, a policy that was continued by Vespasian (69-79), Titus (79-81), and Domitian (81-96), who, according to Suetonius, appointed Epaphroditus as his secretary.
This piece of information may be wrong, because Epaphroditus, while living in retirement, protected the philosopher Epictetus, until Domitian expelled all philosophers from Rome. It is unlikely that the emperor reappointed a man who had been sympathetic to Nero and was connected to the opposition. This also casts some doubt on the story of Epaphroditus' death: according to, again, Suetonius, Domitian had Epaphroditus executed in 95.
- at Livius
I am convinced this is the man appearing in the letters of Saul/Paul. As he writes of Ephisaphroditus in Philippians, he also writes:
All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.
- Philippians 4:22
This fixes the identity of Epaphroditus within the imperial court as the man whom Tacitus calls "Nero's freedman".
Epaphroditus
is a saint of the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church, first Bishop of Philippi, and of Andriacia in Asia Minor, and first Bishop of Terracina, Italy. There is little evidence that these were all the same man.
Epaphroditus was a fellow Christian missionary of St. Paul's.
Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.



For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
- Philippians 2:25-30
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.
I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.
Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
- Philippians 4:10-18
Mentioned only in Philippians 2:25, 4:18, and 4:23. The name corresponds to the Latin Venustus (= handsome), and was very common in the Roman period. "The name occurs very frequently in inscriptions both Greek and Latin, whether at full length Epaphroditus, or in its contracted form Epaphras" (J. B. Lightfoot, Philippians, 123). His name was a pagan one, meaning loved by Aphrodite.
Epaphroditus was the delegate of the Christian community at Philippi, sent with their gift to Paul during his first Roman imprisonment. Paul calls him "my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier." "The three words are arranged in an ascending scale: common sympathy, common work, common danger and toil and suffering" (Lightfoot, l. c.).
On his arrival at Rome, Epaphroditus devoted himself to "the work of Christ," both as Paul's attendant and as his assistant in missionary work. So assiduously did he labor that he lost his health, and in the words of Paul:"he was ill, and almost died." He recovered, however, and Paul sent him back to Philippi with this letter to quiet the alarm of his friends, who had heard of his serious illness. Paul besought for him that the church should receive him with joy and 'honour men like him'.
We see in the financial records of Jucundus, the Chrestian and his banking associates, how slaves and freedmen acted as agents for the masters (and former masters) in financial transactions.
We also have reported from Suetonius: several ex-consuls did not venture to lay hands on his (Nero's) chamberlains although they caught them on their estates with tow and fire-brands, while some granaries near the Golden House, whose room he particularly desired, were demolished by engines of war and then set on fire, because their walls were of stone.
In 65... After the execution of the conspirators, Epaphroditus received military honors. He was now a wealthy man and owned large gardens on the Esquiline hill, east of the Domus Aurea ("golden house"), which Nero had started to construct after the great fire that had destroyed Rome in 64. (Livius)
It was the senate - and the corrupt senators - turning against Nero thhat brought his death:
In March 68, Gaius Julius Vindex, the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis, rebelled against Nero's tax policies.[136] [137]Lucius Verginius Rufus, the governor of Germania Superior, was ordered to put down Vindex's rebellion. [138] In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province, Vindex called upon Servius Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, to join the rebellion and further, to declare himself emperor in opposition



to Nero.[139] At the Battle of Vesontio in May 68, Verginius' forces easily defeated those of Vindex and the latter committed suicide.[138] However after putting down this one rebel, Verginius' legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as emperor. Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for Nero.
While Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy. The prefect of the Praetorian Guard, Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus, also abandoned his allegiance to the emperor and came out in support for Galba.
At this time a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death.
It was in this obscure circumstance that Nero died, with but Epaphroditus at his side.
Marcus Antonius Pallas
(c. 1–63) was a prominent Greek freedman and secretary during the reigns of the Roman Emperors Claudius and Nero. His younger brother was:
Marcus Antonius Felix
Felix was the younger brother of the Greek freedman Marcus Antonius Pallas. Pallas served as a secretary of the treasury during the reign of the Emperor Claudius. Felix was a Greek freedman either of Claudius, according to which theory Josephus (Antiq. xx. 7) calls him Claudius Felix, or for Claudius's mother Antonia Minor, a daughter of Triumvir Mark Antony to Octavia Minor and niece of Emperor Augustus. According to Tacitus, Pallas and Felix descended from the Greek Kings of Arcadia. Felix became the procurator by the petition of his brother.
Felix’s cruelty and licentiousness, coupled with his accessibility to bribes (see Book of Acts 24:26), led to a great increase of crime in Judaea. The period of his rule was marked by internal feuds and disturbances, which he put down with severity.
After Paul the Apostle was arrested in Jerusalem and rescued from a plot against his life, the local Roman chiliarch Claudius Lysias transferred him to Caesarea, where he stood trial before Felix. On at least one further occasion Felix and his wife Drusilla heard Paul discourse, and later on frequently sent for Paul and talked with him (Acts 24:24-26). When Felix was succeeded as procurator, having already detained Paul for two years, he left him imprisoned as a favor to the Jews (Acts 24:27).
On returning to Rome, Felix was accused of using a dispute between the Jews and Syrians of Caesarea as a pretext to slay and plunder the inhabitants, but through the intercession of his brother, the freedman Pallas, who had great influence with the Emperor Nero, he escaped unpunished. Porcius Festus succeeded him as procurator of Judea.
According to Tacitus, Pallas and Felix descended from the Greek Kings of Arcadia.
Pallas was originally a slave of Antonia Minor, a daughter of Mark Antony and niece of Emperor Augustus. Pallas took her name when freed. Josephus mentions him as the slave sent by Antonia to deliver evidence to the emperor Tiberius concerning the murder of his son Julius Caesar Drusus by Sejanus. Antonia probably manumitted Pallas between the years of 31 and 37, when he would have passed the minimum age for freedom. He is listed as owning land in Egypt during that period, possibly as a reward for his servitude. When Antonia died in 37, he became the client of her son, Claudius, as tradition dictated at the death of a former master and patron.
As a freedman, Pallas rose to great heights in the imperial government. From the beginning of Claudius' reign, the senate was openly hostile to him, which forced him to centralize powers. The daily maintenance of the empire was too much for one man, so Claudius divided it up amongst his trusted freedmen. Pallas was made secretary of the treasury. He did this job with such efficiency that Cornelius Scipio proposed before the Senate that he be rewarded. The position apparently enabled Pallas to reward himself as well, as he is later listed as



one of the richest men of the time by Pliny the Elder. The historians do admit that he never embezzled directly from the imperial account, and his wealth may have come from his financial acumen. Some ancient historians claim that he was able to control the emperor through his high-ranking position, but this is probably not the case. When his brother Felix was recalled to Rome to stand trial for maladministration, Pallas could not prevent him from being banished, though he was at the height of his career. Nor could he prevent his fellow freedmanadministrator Polybius from being executed for treason.
In the second half of Claudius' reign, Pallas chose to support Agrippina the Younger as a new empress after the fall of Empress Messalina. Tacitus notes his intent to reunite the Julian and Claudian families through the marriage, and prevent either a future husband of Agrippina or Agrippina herself from claiming the throne. But the ancient authors also state that the real reason for his choice was that Pallas and Agrippina were lovers. Modern historians suggest that their relationship was strictly business, and they helped each other with mutual goals. Pallas' influence on Agrippina was real and became well-known, but he continued to advise Claudius on matters of state. He was the source of law that stated that a free woman who married a slave would remain free if the master approved.
When Agrippina's son, Nero, succeeded Claudius, Pallas retained his position in the treasury for a time. It is suggested that he assisted Agrippina in murdering Claudius, since he was sure of his future security. This security did not last long. In 55, Nero dismissed Pallas from service, tired of having to deal with any allies of Agrippina. He further accused Pallas of conspiring to overthrow him and place Faustus Sulla, the husband of Claudius' daughter Claudia Antonia, on the throne.Seneca, who was prominent in Nero's circle, came to Pallas' defense at the trial and got him acquitted. Pallas did not elude Nero's wrath forever, and was killed on Nero's orders in 63 - possibly to gain access to his large fortune, part of which was his by right as Pallas' official patron. Some money must have gone to Pallas' family, as a descendant of his became consul in 167.
- Source: Oost, S.V. "The Career of M. Antonius Pallas." American Journal of Philology 79 (1958). 113-139.
Comment: Nero executing him in 63 suggests that Pallas was associated with Saulus and Poppaea Sabina, and therefore also with Epaphroditus. In fact, so many of these characters were slaves that one must consider this in relation to the Tradition that Christianity attracted slaves predominantly.
a. Paul Chats Up Major Officials and the Royal Family
Paul is put on trial. Although Acts does not make very clear the charges, Felix, the governor, keeps him under house arrest (probably actually protective custody). Felix and his wife Drusilla (not identified as such but actually the sister of King Agrippa II) carry on conversations with Paul over the course of 2 years(!) about theological and perhaps other matters. At this point (60 C.E.) Festus succeeds Felix and is pressed by “the Jews” once again about Paul, whom Festus then gives a new trial. Again, the charges are not clear. Paul demands an appeal to the emperor Nero, a request that is granted.
b. It is therefore likely that Paul’s extended conversations with Felix, Festus, and Agrippa II, whatever theological excursions they may have contained, were basically debriefing sessions that provided these authorities with invaluable intelligence on the workings of the resistance movement that was spiraling out of their control.
(Gould review)
Eisenman reviewed by Price:
Agrippa I's third daughter Drusilla, after contemplating marriage to the son of King Antiochus, married King Azizus of Emesa because he had agreed to circumcise himself (as Antiochus' son had not). Displaying that cynical opportunism so typical of Herodians, Drusilla divorced him on her own initiative to marry Felix, a marriage connived at in Caesarea by someone who can be none other than the infamous Simon Magus (like its anagram "Mnason" above, he too is a "Cypriot"). Simon's singular service to Felix was to convince Drusilla to divorce her previous husband. In this episode many themes emerge which are of the utmost importance for dating Qumran documents and understanding the true gist of their critique of the establishment. Even Josephus, who is usually so accommodating on such matters (later finding Herodian practices congenial, he too divorces a wife), describes Drusilla's self-divorce from the King of Emesa as contrary to "the laws of her forefathers." He makes a similar comment about an earlier such divorce by Herodias, which is at the root of problems relating to the death of John in both Josephus and the New Testament. These divorces are anticipated by the divorce of Herod's sister Salome from the Idumaean Costobarus, so important in all our genealogies and paralleled by similar ones by Mariamne (mentioned above) and Bernice from Polemos of Cilicia to take up with Titus (which would involve her in a two-fold denunciation at Qumran, not to mention her "riches" and the rumor of her illicit connection with Agrippa II which Josephus also mentions relative to the Polemos affair). Paul, too, shows his knowledge of this kind of divorce in discussing James' 'Jerusalem Council' "fornication" directives in 1 Cor 7:10f., but importantly he does not condemn them. Instead, he gently slaps the wrist of the offending woman by recommending that she abstain from further marriage and specifies no further punitive procedures.
Antonia Caenis



a former slave and secretary of Antonia Minor (mother of the emperor Claudius), was the mistress of the Roman emperor Vespasian. It is believed that she was born in Istria, now in Croatia, based on a trip she took there on her own Cassius Dio 66.14. In her 30s Caenis, still possibly a slave, was in an unofficial relationship known as contubernium, with Vespasian before his marriage. According to Suetonius, after the death of Vespasian's wife Flavia Domitilla, Vespasian and Caenis, now a freedwoman, resumed their relationship; she was his wife "in all but name" until her death in AD 74. She had a remarkable memory and considerable influence on the emperor's administration, carried out official business on his behalf, and apparently made a lot of money from her position. However, she was treated with disrespect by Vespasian's son Domitian, who refused to greet her as one of the family (Cassius Dio 66.14).
And lastly:
Alexander the Alabarch: Roman and Jew
Katherine G. Evans
Summary presented to the Philo of Alexandria Seminar of the Nov. 1995 annual meeting of Society of Biblical Literature. Full text of article published in SBL Seminar Papers, 1995, p. 576-594.
The present study represents a "back door" entry to Philonic studies in that it attempts to reconstruct the historical Philo based on what can be known about his brother Alexander the alabarch. I propose that Alexander was both a very prominent Roman citizen and a very prominent Jew with social ties that stretched from the Imperial family in Rome to the royal family and priesthood in Judea and that Philo to some extent shared this status.
Alexander is known to us directly only through 5 references in Josephus and indirectly through Philo's On Animals. Although Josephus' reliability is always at issue, I believe that here he was probably accurate because Josephus almost certainly had met a number of Alexander's relatives if not the alabarch himself and because the War andAntiquities were dedicated to the Emperors Vespasian and Titus who were close friends with Alexander's son Ti. Alexander.
In War 5.205 it is learned that Alexander had the nine gates of the Temple in Jerusalem overlaid with massive plates of silver and gold, a gift which one can assume would have placed him on very good terms with the Temple High Priest among others. This is but one of a number of indications of Alexander's great wealth. In around 35 C.E. Agrippa sailed to Alexandria and begged Alexander for a loan of 200,000 drachmas (Antiquities 18.159-160). Agrippa and Alexander were probably previously acquainted particularly since both men were friends of Claudius before he became Emperor. Josephus tells us that Alexander was "old friends" with Claudius which would suggest that they were roughly contemporary in age or born around 10 B.C.E. Since there is no evidence that Claudius ever journeyed to Egypt, Alexander probably spent time in Rome. It is plausible that he was educated there and grew up "in the circle of Claudius" as Josephus reports Agrippa did.
Alexander also became an epitropos for the mother of Claudius, Antonia Drusus, which I suggest meant that Alexander became the procurator of Antonia's extensive land estates in Egypt. At some point Alexander was appointed "alabarch" which appears to have been a Roman magistry responsible for tax assessment.
Sometime between 37 and 41 C.E. the Emperor Gaius imprisoned Alexander in a fit of anger. The exact reason is unknown but may have been connected somehow with Philo's embassy to Gaius in 39/40. Upon becoming Emperor, Claudius released Alexander from prison and soon thereafter Alexander's son Marcus married Agrippa's daughter Berenice thus linking Alexander's family to the Jewish ruling class through marriage. Josephus also reported that Alexander surpassed all his fellow citizens in both ancestry and wealth (Antiquities 20.100). What Josephus considered to be "superior ancestry" may be elucidated by the beginning of his Life where he relates that for Jews a claim to nobility includes a connection to the priesthood and having royal blood by being descended from the Hasmoneans. If this characterization applies then we can deduce that Alexander was considered a nobleman in both Alexandria and Judea tracing his ancestry back to the Hasmoneans and the priesthood. Josephus also mentions Alexander's religious devotion and adherence to his ancestral practices.
There can be no question that Alexander was a Roman citizen. This is supported by the Roman names of his two sons, Marcus and Ti. Julius Alexander and the status of the latter. Ti. Alexander held the exalted status of inlustris eques or "knight of the first rank" which was second only to the Roman senatorial class. Besides being a procurator of Judea he attained the two pinnacles of an equestrian career, Prefect of Egypt and Praetorian Prefect. It would have been virtually impossible for Ti. Alexander to obtain such distinguished rank



and titles if his father had not already been established as one of the Roman elite. In all likelihood Roman citizenship was granted to Alexander's father or grandfather by Julius Caesar.
Alexander's full Roman name would have been some unknown first name or praenomen followed by Julius Alexander. A variation of Alexander's name is found in some manuscripts of Antiquities 19.276. In the passage which mentions Alexander's imprisonment by Gaius some manuscripts call him Alexander Lysimachus or simply Lysimachus. This is likely a later confusion with a third brother named Lysimachus as clarified in Philo's On Animals.
Finally, I return now to the question at hand. What can knowledge of the status of Alexander reveal to us about Philo's relationship to Judaism? The answer to this question may depend partly upon the exact blood relationship of the brothers. Did they have the same two parents and if not did they share the parent through whom Alexander derived his "superior ancestry?" Josephus tells us that Philo was a man held in the highest honor which may indicate that they did. I have suggested above that Alexander was descended from priests and Jerome provides an independent witness that this was also true of Philo. Philo was also related to the ruling class of Judea through the marriage of his nephew Marcus if not before that. I have no doubt that when Philo made his pilgrimmage to Jerusalem as described in On Providence that he was welcomed as an honored guest for his brother's sake as well as for his own. It is also very likely that Philo was a Roman citizen since Alexander's parents would have only married Romans to keep the citizenship in the family. Interestingly the possession of Roman citizenship appears to have opened doors among both Jews and Romans for the family of Alexander the alabarch and may have done so as well for Philo.

Epaphroditus and the Judean schism - Origins of Christianity
16-21 minutes
Tiberius Claudius Epaphroditus (to which Augusti libertus ("freedman of the emperor") could be added); mentioned as apparitor Caesarum; as viator tribunicius he served the emperor; as a libellis he drafted Nero's replies to petitions; mentioned by Josephus as his patron in the Jewish Antiquities, his Autobiography, and Against the Greeks.
Epaphroditus is a saint of the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church, first Bishop of Philippi, and of Andriacia in Asia Minor, and first Bishop of Terracina, Italy.
Epaphroditus was a fellow missionary of Saul/St. Paul.
Much of the New Testament - some characters and events, and both the political and geographical landscape - is drawn on the chronicles of Josephus, written in the private home of emperor Vespasian. One such (important) character is Epaphroditus, for as well as Josephus dedicating work to him, he also appears in other sources as well as the New Testament
However, some persons there were who desired to know our history, and so exhorted me to go on with it; and, above all the rest, Epaphroditus, a man who is a lover of all kind of learning, but is principally delighted with the knowledge of history, and this on account of his having been himself concerned in great affairs, and many turns of fortune, and having shown a wonderful rigor of an excellent nature, and an immovable virtuous resolution in them all. I yielded to this man's persuasions, who always excites such as have abilities in what is useful and acceptable, to join their endeavors with his. (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews - Preface)
In the midst of the war in Judea, Nero is assassinated. Among those accused of having a hand in this would appear to be our Epaphroditus, Paul's associate and the focus of our discussion, whom he calls in Philippians 2:25: his "brother, co-worker, and fellow soldier", his (not "Jesus"') "Apostle" a man (Josephus tells us in his dedication to The Antiquities), who "participated in many important events". Though some might object to this tripartite identification, not only do Suetonius and others affirm that Epaphroditus was Nero's secretary - which would make Paul's intimations in Philippians 4:18 about "Saints in the household of Caesar" (which is just where Paul says he is sending him) all the more accurate - but this same "Epaphroditus" re-emerges, survivor that he seems to have been, in the early 80's as Domitian (81-96 CE)'s secretary as well.
Not long before Domitian, too, was assassinated in 96 CE, Epaphroditus (it is hard to separate the two, since he is working in the same capacity for both Emperors and being "Secretary for Greek Letters" gave him no mean writing skill) appears to have run afoul of him too - purportedly over his behaviour at the time of Nero's assassination which Domitian seems to have used as a pretext to execute him, complaining that he (Epaphroditus) had dared to raise his hand against an Emperor! This is most peculiar, indeed, coming from a man like Domitian and there would appear to be more behind these events than appears on the surface.
This Epaphroditus is certainly worth examining in detail, not in regards the writing the first gospels, but in the political context of Judea - and Chrestianity - in the first century.
Eisenman describes a schism in Judea: messianic Jews versus Herodians, but the conflict was wider than that. Alexander the Alabarch and his brother, Philo the philosopher, were in Alexandria; the office of Alabarch was a Roman imperial appointment and he also was the estate manager of Antonia Minor (and Felix had probably been her slave).
This is the dimension Eisenman misses - important Romans concerned with keeping Roman puppets in power in the provinces. "Educating" them as children was the role of Antonia Minor.
So although the Herodians are important, they should be treated as part of this larger group. Here, they are termed Chrestian, in part because of inscription CIL VI 24944, which names Antonia and her husband Drusus:



In the early-1st century, the Judean world had split into two camps - as they has much earlier - the conservative and pious, versus those agreeing to the foreign innovations of the Herodian monarchy. Many in the Judean upper class found Greco-Roman society and imperial rule more comfortable as well as profitable; they regarded messianic Jews as a threat to their comfort and security; they found support from those descended from the Jews who fled to Egypt when forced Hellenisation of Judea failed.
These Chrestians were more than just a political faction, for they had a theology, as we see in the archaeology of early baptisteries, churches and texts later claimed as Christian.
Mosaic with Chrest at a 3rd-century Megiddo church.
Chrestian theology used Greek Magic as developed in Ptolemaic Egypt. In the first century of the modern era, it began to take a form of its own, adopting Ptolemaic symbols such as the Tau Rho and Chi-Rho, itself grown out of Hellenistic syncretism with the pharaonic ankh.
The 'Pauline' epistles (assuming some of them have some veracity) and Luke/Acts describe Saul/Paul building his own Church; this may well be the foundation for the 'seven churches of Asia' in Revelation. This Saul is Herodian and Chrestian, violently opposed to messianic Judaism. He is identified by Eisenman as the Spouter of Lies of the Dead Sea Scrolls and like the NT Saul, is described by Josephus as a leader of a gang violently persecuting messianic Jews.
We therefore have historical accounts linking these people:
Josephus - a notable traitor to the Jewish cause in the 1st Jewish-Roman War - dedicating his work to Epaphroditus.
"Berillus take care" with Chrestian symbol; found on the wall of the villa of Poppaea Sabina at Oplontis, outside Naples. The graffito has been related to a passage in Josephus that mentions a Beryllus, tutor and secretary of Nero, who, between 60 and 62 CE, paid by Syrian leaders, requested that the emperor cancel the equal political rights (isopoliteia) of the Jews in Caesarea.
Poppaea Sabina (born in Pompeii ca. 30), wife of the emperor Nero, entertaining Josephus in Rome; he is almost certainly already in league with her and her cohorts. If she was killed by Nero as tradition asserts, then a plausible explanation is that her Chrestian role was discovered.



Epaphroditus, chamberlain and in effect prime minister at the imperial court of Nero and Poppaea Sabina. Later condemned by the emperor Domitian for his role in the death of Nero; patron of Josephus, the two disappear from the record at the same time. Sextus Afranius Burrus (1 CE - 62 CE), prefect of the Praetorian guard; the gaoler and friend of Saul in Rome.
Agrippina the Younger chose him as Prefect in 51 to secure her son Nero's place as Emperor after the death of Claudius. For the first eight years of Nero's rule, Burrus and Nero's former tutor Seneca helped maintain a stable government. Burrus acquiesced to Nero's murder of Agrippina the Younger but lost his influence over Nero anyway. He died in 62, some say from poison.
High-status prisoners, whether Roman or foreign, were typically held in the custody of individual Romans, sometimes at their homes or country estates. (Mamertine Prison). Between the years 51 and 62 CE there was just one Prefect - Afrianus Burrus.
27 And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment. (Acts 27)
16 When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.
17 Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. (Acts 28)
Saul, descended from General Costobarus and Salome, sister of Herod I the Great; Josephus: So the men of power perceiving that the sedition was too hard for them to subdue, and that the danger which would arise from the Romans would come upon them first of all, endeavored to save themselves, and sent ambassadors, some to Florus, the chief of which was Simon the son of Ananias; and others to Agrippa, among whom the most eminent were Saul, and Antipas, and Costobarus, who were of the king's kindred; and they desired of them both that they would come with an army to the city, and cut off the seditious before it should be too hard to be subdued.
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord. (Romans 16:12)
Numerous characters appear in the 'Pauline' epistles and although modern scholarship dismisses some of these texts as spurious, the consensus is that some are probably genuine, at least in part. This forces the question as to how any genuine texts could have survived into later centuries; however, recognition of his role as a Herodian (let alone Chrestian) agent provocateur allows for preservation of his correspondence with both the Herodian and imperial courts (through Epaphroditus).
One woman - whose children were raised by Antonia Minor - is of particular interest: queen Antonia Tryphaena (10 BCE - 55 CE):
Tryphaena’s brother Polemon II married the Judean Princess Julia Berenice and through their marriage Polemon converted to Judaism and probably later became a Christian. Tryphaena is associated with the life of the Saint Thecla, the Acts of Paul and Thecla and Saint Tryphaena of Cyzicus. Saint Tryphaena is the patron saint of Cyzicus and she was named in honor of Tryphaena.
It was written prior to AD 190.[2]...In the Eastern Church, the wide circulation of the Acts of Paul and Thecla in Greek, Syriac, and Armenian is evidence of the veneration of Thecla of Iconium...
Paul is also an ambiguous figure in this work. He is seen as a preacher of asceticism, but one with whom women are besotted. His teachings lead Thecla into trouble, and yet he is never there when the trouble comes.
This Acts is an example of the textual tradition existing in the Levant, probably associated with Saul's 'seven churches'. This textual tradition existed independently from that of the gospels and only later are the different traditions merged to become the New Testament.
Alexander the Alabarch, estate manager of Antonia Minor. Used his power to with-hold the grain supply to Italy, forcing the selection of Vespasan as emperor. The numerous hostage royal children of Antonia Minor, listed here. Marcus Julius Alexander, son of the Alabarch; known to have traded by sea out of Egypt; married 41 CE princess Berenice, daughter of king Agrippa I of Judea. Tiberius Julius Alexander, son of the Alabarch; rejected Judaism; became best friend of Titus, who became emperor after his father, Vespasian. Attended siege and destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st Jewish-Roman War.



Philo, philosopher in Alexandria and brother of the Alabarch; "used philosophical allegory to attempt to fuse and harmonize Greek philosophy with Jewish philosophy" and thus was the principal theologian of Chrestianity in the early 1st century.
The self-contradictions in Philo's accounts of his role as Judean ambassador to Rome place him in the same position as Josephus on his visit to Rome, in that both were probably already working covertly against messianic Judaism and Jews. Along with the covert role of Saul as the Spouter of Lies penetrating Qumran, the covert character of Chrestianity within the Eastern Roman provinces is exposed. Saul was sent to Nero in Corinth and disappears - he probably died under interrogation which led to Nero's identifying Chrestians.
Lucius Caecilius Iucundus, mentioned as a Chrestian in CIL VI 24944 (above); a banker who lived in Pompeii around 20 - 69 CE. His house still stands in the city's ruins; it was partially destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79. This house is known for its beauty, along with some material found about bank book-keeping and wax tablets, which were receipts. His sons' names implied a relationship with the illustrious family of the Caecilii Metelli, one of the most important and wealthiest Roman families. Various slaves of Antonia Minor, who became useful freedmen/women; include Epaphroditus and: Antonius Felix, Roman procurator of Judea 52-58; debriefed Saul and must have been Saul's case officer. Marcus Antonius Agrippa (PIR2 A 809), son of Felix and the Jewish Drusilla, perished with his wife in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 20.7.2)
Marcus Antonius Pallas, chamberlain to emperors Claudius and Nero.
Antonia Caenis, became common-law wife to emperor Vespasian.
We should also look briefly at the assassination of emperor Domitian; one of the sons of emperor Vespasian, he stuck to traditional, conservative Roman values and so rejected the Chrestian policies of Vespasian and Titus.
Domitian was assassinated on 18 September 96, in a palace conspiracy organized by court officials. A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius, who alleges that Domitian's chamberlain Parthenius was the chief instigator behind the conspiracy, citing the recent execution of Domitian's secretary Epaphroditus as the primary motive. The murder itself was carried out by a freedman of Parthenius named Maximus, and a steward of Domitian's
niece Flavia Domitilla, named Stephanus.[137]
And here is the Chrestian connection:
Flavia Domitilla (saint). Flavia Domitilla was daughter of Domitilla the Younger by an unknown father, perhaps Quintus Petillius Cerialis. She married her cousin, the consul Titus Flavius Clemens.
That Chrestians were assassinating Roman emperors in the first century also demonstrates their true character.
Witness accounts describe imperial chamberlains starting the Great Fire of Rome; this would thus include Epaphroditus at least.
...several ex-consuls did not venture to lay hands on his (Nero's) chamberlains although they caught them on their estates with tow and fire-brands... (Suetonius, The Life of Nero)
Archaeological study of the earliest layer of the Basilica of San Clemente shows that it was founded on a basilica built out of the ashes of the Great Fire. This was the family home of Titus Flavius Clemens:
Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Clemens was a nephew of the Roman Emperor Vespasian. He was the son of Titus Flavius Sabinus, consul in AD 52 and praefectus urbi during the reign of Nero, and a brother of Titus Flavius Sabinus, consul in AD 82. The emperors Titus and Domitian were his cousins...
Clemens also married one of his cousins, Flavia Domitilla, daughter of Vespasian's daughter, Domitilla, who was thus also a niece of Domitian. They had two sons, whom Domitian intended to succeed him in the empire, renaming one of them Vespasian and the other Domitian. However, in AD 95, when Clemens and the emperor were consuls, Domitian had his cousin put to death.
Clement becomes one of the most famous and important names associated in the textual tradition with the early Church and appears with Saul/Paul:
3 Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
None of these people were Christian - there was no Christianity in this period.

Conspiracies
The standard history of Rome in the first century is replete with conspiracies, as emperors and members of the imperial families are assassinated, often by each other. So many are there that novelists and screenwriters have produced numerous fine works exploring them - and no doubt will continue to do so.
This evidence-based history simplifies what is an otherwise-convoluted and complex series of largelydisconnected murderous conspiracies. Once the archaeological evidences are pieced together however, a moresimple and obvious picture emerges. Miracles, prophecies, omens and gods are put in their proper place products of the minds of men.
Clement
Whether Chrestians started the Great Fire, or just added to the conflagration, their motive was base: profit. (The attempts to blame Nero - continued into the present day - supports the Chrestian, then Christian cause.) The later textual tradition adds these Clements:
1. Pope Clement I saint, (88–98) 2. Titus Flavius Clemens (ca. 150 – ca. 215), known as Clement of Alexandria. Note how this one has exactly the same name as the historical one of the 1st century - an example for how the textual tradition was created, mirroring actual imperial history.
If the Clements were Christian - one supposedly a sainted pope - how come this temple to Mithras?
The accepted history of the first century is largely nonsensical fiction when using late and anonymous sources. The history of Judea was written by a Jewish traitor. The history of Christianity was written anonymously many centuries later and attributed to people who didn't exist. Only archaeology can rescue this situation.

Chrestians in the first century have Antonia Minor at the centre of their web. Her Alexandrian connections allow her to manipulate the Jewish communities both in Egypt and Judea; her familial influence in the imperial court allows her to place Chrestians in provincial courts across the Levant. Her freedmen run the imperial court in Rome for most of the first century (long after she is gone); Epaphroditus remains until the century's end. By then, Chrestianity is established both in Rome and its eastern provinces.

Chrestians of Pompeii - Origins of Christianity
15-18 minutes
Epaphroditus and the Judean schism contains a number of references to the Roman city of Pompeii (destroyed in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE). They are collected here.
Chrestianity emerged from the Greek, syncretic fusion of the religions of pharaonic and Ptolemaic Egypt, which reached its peak with Cleopatra VII and entered the Roman empire as a result of her famous liaisons.
The Temple of Isis is a Roman temple dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Isis. This small and almost intact temple was among one of the first discoveries during the excavation of Pompeii in 1764... Its role as a Hellenized Egyptian temple in a Roman colony was fully confirmed with an inscription detailed by Francisco la Vega on July 20, 1765.
The preserved Pompeian temple is actually the second structure; the original building built during the reign of Augustus was damaged in an earlier earthquake of 62 AD. Initiates of the Isis mystery cult worshipped a compassionate goddess who promised eventual salvation and a perpetual relationship throughout life and after death.
Isis was a goddess in Ancient Egyptian religious beliefs, whose worship spread throughout the Greco-Roman world. She was worshipped as the ideal mother, wife, the matron of nature and magic... it did provide a relationship with the divine that was not ruptured with death.
The setting and adornments provided an attractive backdrop for the liturgical rites. These services occurred daily with a solemn morning opening and a nightly closing filled with singing. A ritual bucket for holy Nile water, the situla, and a rattle, the sistrum, were both used in worship.
How is this important? Chrestianity, then Christianity, emboded the essence of the Osiris myth:
The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris' murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris' wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of Isis and Osiris' union, who is first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus' triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process



of Osiris' resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder and, especially, death and the afterlife.
It is this resurrection ritual, held annually on the Nile, which Hadrian used with Antinous. Many today see Isis and Horus (right) as the principal prototype Virgin and Child. As Chrestianity emerged from the syncretism of the faiths of pharaonic Eypt and the Ptolemaic rulers, so the Osiris myth was transmuted to serve its purpose in the Roman Empire.
At Pompeii, the Isiac priestly diet included eggs, lentils, and nuts. However, sacred meals, possibly with initiates or congregants, were also eaten within the temple using special tables, at least one of which at Delos was dedicated to Chrēstē Isis.*
* Roussel, Les cultes égyptiens á Delos, 20, 99.
(Durham E-Theses, Reading Romans in Rome: A Reception of Romans in the Roman Context of Ethnicity and Faith, HOLDSWORTH, BENJAMIN,EVANS)
Now, the list:
Poppaea Sabina (born in Pompeii ca. 30), wife of the emperor Nero, entertaining Josephus in Rome; he is almost certainly already in league with her and her cohorts. If she was killed by Nero as tradition asserts, then a plausible explanation is that her Chrestian role was discovered.
Wiki:
The historians of antiquity describe her as a beautiful woman who used intrigues to become empress.
Poppaea Sabina the Younger was born in Pompeii in AD 30 as the daughter of Titus Olliusand
Poppaea Sabina the Elder.[1] Most evidence suggesting Poppaea's Pompeiian origins comes from the 20th century excavations of the town, destroyed in the 79 AD eruption ofMount Vesuvius. For instance, legal documents found during excavations in nearbyHerculaneum described her as being the owner of a brick- or tile-work business in the Pompeii area. It is very likely that Poppaea's family came from Pompeii, and the common belief is that they might have been the owners of the House of the Menander (a house in Pompeii named for the painting of the 4th century BC
playwright Menander that is found there).[2]
How did she become Chrestian? Antonia Minor was gone long before, though as we see in Epaphroditus and others, Chrestians covertly ruled the imperial court. This seems the probable link:
Poppaea's first marriage was to Rufrius Crispinus, a man of equestrian rank. They married in 44, when Poppaea was 14 years old. He was the leader of the Praetorian Guard during the first ten years of the reign of the Emperor Claudius, until 51, when Claudius' new wife Agrippina the Younger removed him from this position. Agrippina regarded him as loyal to the deceased Messalina's memory and replaced him with Sextus Afranius Burrus. Later, under Nero he was executed. During their marriage, Poppaea gave birth to his son, a younger Rufrius Crispinus, who, after her death, would be drowned by Nero while out on a fishing trip.
Here are two Satires aimed at Chrestians:
1. Rufrius Crispinus was a equestrian who lived during the later Julio-Claudian dynasty.[1] The satirist Juvenal spitefully described him as one the "dregs" of the "Nile", indicating his Egyptian origin. 2. The xenophobic speaker of Juvenal's first Satire, composed in the late 1st or early 2nd century, complains of passing the Forum's triumphal statues, "where some Egyptian Arabarch's had the nerve to set up his
titles. At his image it's right to do more than piss!"[27] This is very likely a reference to Alexander.[28]
Why satire? Because most Romans were conservative and these were the audience of Juvenal; provincials coming to Rome - such as Chrestians from Egypt - were ridiculed.



Lucius Caecilius Iucundus, mentioned as a Chrestian in CIL VI 24944 (above); a banker who lived in Pompeii around 20 - 69 CE. His house still stands in the city's ruins; it was partially destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79. This house is known for its beauty, along with some material found about bank book-keeping and wax tablets, which were receipts. His sons' names implied a relationship with the illustrious family of the Caecilii Metelli, one of the most important and wealthiest Roman families.
Antonius Felix, Roman procurator of Judea 52-58; debriefed Saul and must have been Saul's case officer. Marcus Antonius Agrippa (PIR2 A 809), son of Felix and the Jewish Drusilla, perished with his wife in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 20.7.2)
Christians came to like and adopt many of the symbols, motifs, icons, liturgies and even texts of Chrestianity. One example is:
The earliest dateable Sator Square was found in the ruins of Pompeii. Wiki:
J. Gwyn Griffiths contended that it came, via Alexandria, from the attested Egyptian name Ḥr-Ḥp, which he took
to mean "the face of Apis".[2] An origin in Graeco-Roman Egypt was also advocated by Miroslav Marcovich, who maintains that Arepo is a Latinized abbreviation of Harpocrates, god of the rising sun, in some places
called Γεωργός `Aρπον, which Marcovich suggests corresponds to Sator Arepo.[3]

These are simply five words ingeniously evolved from the Paternoster charm in such a way that, when properly combined, they form a square which can be read in four, different directions. The ‘magic’ of the square is basically the perfect symmetry of its component letters. These also betray cryptic Jewish symbols to those who know their origin and secret. To construct such a square from the Paternoster amulet is a technical achievement of the highest order. To require that the individual words, one of which, the palindrome of OPERA, is not even a Latin word, will also be meaningful when read concurrently is to expect the impossible. Any superficial meaning therefore which may be allegedly wrung from them is purely accidental.
The final verdict on the origin of the Rotas-Sator square is clearly dependent on future archaeological discoveries. But in the present state of the evidence it seems reasonable to conclude that this charm, at least in the form we now have it, originated with Latin-speaking Jews (presumably settled in Italy) in the period immediately prior to the Christian Era. Such an origin is itself sufficient explanation of its cryptic form; alternatively, it may have been a product of the pogroms of, e.g., A.D. 19 or A.D. 49. It would seem that it fell into disuse, to be revived later as a Christian symbol amid the new enthusiasm for symbolism characteristic of the third century and later.
Right: Isis, Serapis and their child Harpocrates (Louvre Museum). In late Greek mythology as developed in Ptolemaic Alexandria, Harpocrates (Ancient Greek: Ἁρποκράτης) is the god of silence. Harpocrates was adapted by the Greeks from the Egyptian child god Horus.
The Paternoster - Lord's prayer - has Jewish origins:
There are similarities between the Lord's Prayer and both biblical and post-biblical material in Jewish prayer especially Kiddushin 81a (Babylonian). "Hallowed be thy name" is reflected in the Kaddish. "Lead us not into sin" is echoed in the "morning blessings" of Jewish prayer. A blessing said by some Jewish communities after the evening Shema includes a phrase quite similar to the opening of the Lord's Prayer: "Our God in heaven, hallow thy name, and establish thy kingdom forever, and rule over us for ever and ever. Amen." There are parallels also in 1 Chronicles 29:1018.
Other authorities believe the Sator Square was Mithraic or Jewish in origin because it is not likely that Pompeii had a large Christian population in 79 A.D and the symbolism inferred as Christian and the use of Latin in Christianity is not attested to until later. (Sator Square)



Scene VII in the Villa dei Misteri (Pompeii)
Villa of The Mysteries contains one very unusual feature, a room decorated with beautiful and strange scenes; the room is known to us as "The Initiation Chamber". The fresco images here seem to part of a ritual ceremony aimed at preparing privileged, protected girls for marriage. Interpretation: in similar rituals the confused, and sometimes drugged initiate emerges like an infant at birth, from a dark place to a lighted place; she reaches for a covered object sitting in a winnowing basket, the liknon; the covered object is taken by many to be a phallus, or a herm.

Summary
There is no evidence - and there cannot be any - for Christianity in Pompeii, for this city and surrounding area were buried centuries before Christianity appeared. Chrestianity, on the other hand, existed near the beginning of the modern era and - after the destruction of Jerusalem - most of its leading proponents were in Egypt and Italy (others were in Saul's new Church). Those artefacts which Christians have been tempted to claim as Christian must therefore belong to an earlier faith or faiths, and as we see here, these come from Egypt, as did Chrestian theology.
Covert organisations need covert financing and this applies to Chrestianity. The banking activities of Jucundus provide a good cover. Chrestian involvement in the Great Fire of Rome also indicates their interest in illegal financial dealings, especially with property. At this point and in Italy at least, the Chrestian congregation could perhaps be compared to the modern mafia, or the related criminal activities of the Vatican bank (Institute for the Works of Religion).
Why Pompeii? The most important Chrestian associated directly with this fated city is Poppaea Sabina, for whom we have these evidences:
She is of Pompeii. Josephus reports that she had a certain predilection for Judaism, and is characterized by Josephus ("Ant." xx. 8, § 11; "Vita," § 3) as θεοσεβής ("religious"). But Judaism in what form? Not messianic. When Josephus first visits Rome (in 64), he is welcomed by her as empress and there is good reason to regard him as a covert agent against the messianic movement in Judea before then, or he was recruited while in Rome. The "beware" message to Nero's secretary. Lastly, the way Nero suddenly turns against her and others we should regard as probably Chrestian. He seems to have become aware of the covert group manipulating events across the Levant. Was this awareness from his interrogation of Saul? Though the chronology seems to contradict this, the time difference is slight and the sources not totally reliable, so the possibility remains open.
Other empresses did not make a habit of involvement in either Judean, or Jewish affairs, but this one did, even though this was not her responsibility (but, if needed, that of her husband, the emperor). Something or somebody drove her to it and history does not account for this - it is just another one of the innumerable mysteries to historians of this period; an important factor has been missing and this is probably Chrestianity.
Notes



Historians of the period use the terms "Jew" and "Judaism", along with associated terms such as "priest" as though there was just one brand of Jewish religion. This was never true, for there were the Samaritans; there were also cults across the Levant which imitated Jews and Judaism; others (as in Greek Magic) adopt Jewish names and terms;as importantly, Judaism was split - as it had been since the invasion and suppression by the Greek/Seleucid Antiochus Epiphanes IV - into two camps: the appeasers of the dominant foreign power, and those who clung fast to their beliefs. In the first century, this power was imperial Rome; the family ruling Judea with Roman support was Herodian, of which Saul was a prominent member; but not all the emperors in Rome could be depended upon by Levantine rulers who were totally dependent on Roman power - to make every ruling in their favour. These provincial rulers could be easily unsettled and perhaps unseated without the necessarilycovert support of Antonia Minor and her minions, as originally authorised by Augustus. This role was taken by Chrestianity.
The (Second) Temple of Jerusalem was the centre of Judaism, collecting a tithe from observant Jews across the world. Management of the Temple was the responsibility of the king - the Herodian monarchy in this period. The king appointed the High Priest (list). When, therefore, reference is made to 'Jews', one must ask: which? Messianic Jews who tended to recognise the authority of the Righteous Teacher (based at Qumran) - John the Baptiser, then James - or Hellenised Jews who supported the Herodian monarchy and Roman occupation?
Left: The Antonia Fortress was a military barracks built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great in Jerusalem on the site of earlier Ptolemaic and Hasmonean strongholds, named after Herod's patron Mark Antony, father of Antonia Minor. The fortress was built at the eastern end of the great wall of the city (the second wall), on the northeastern side of the city, near the Temple Mount and the Pool of Bethesda.
Prior to the First Jewish-Roman War, the Antonia housed some part of the Roman garrison of Jerusalem. The Romans also stored the high priest's vestments within the Fortress.

Coin of Herod I
Note the Staurogram symbol: The Staurogram (meaning monogram of the cross, from the Greek σταυρός, i.e. cross), or Monogrammatic Cross or Tau-Rho symbol, is composed by a tau (Τ) superimposed on a rho (Ρ). The Staurogram was first used to abbreviate the Greek word for cross in very early New Testament manuscripts such as P66, P45 and P75, almost like a nomen sacrum.
In this case, the tau-rho has been described as a mark for the regnal year; in Dura Europos, as the moneyer's mark; fact is, numismatists guess as much as do scholars interpreting nomina sacra as Christian.
With one exception - Herod Agrippa/Agrippa I (11 BCE- 44 CE) - the Herodian monarchy was regarded by most observant Jews in Judea as a foreign, tyrannical and (in the pro-Greek, anti-Jewish manner of Antiochus IV Epiphanes) anti-Jewish dynasty who survived only through Roman military support. Their rule began with Herod I the Great:
According to Josephus, Herod ruled for 37 years, 34 of them after capturing Jerusalem.
As Herod's family were converts to Judaism, his religious commitment was questioned by some elements of Jewish society...
While Herod publicly identified himself as a Jew and was considered as such by some, this
religious identification was undermined by the decadent lifestyle of the Herodians, which would have earned them the antipathy of observant Jews.
In The Jewish War, Josephus characterizes Herod’s rule generally in favorable terms, and gives Herod the benefit of the doubt for the infamous events that took place during his reign. However, in his later work, Jewish Antiquities, Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod’s reign.
Herod’s tyrannical authority has been demonstrated by many of his security measures aimed at suppressing the contempt his people, especially Jews, had towards him. For instance, it has been suggested that Herod used secret police to monitor and report the feelings of the general populace towards him. He sought to prohibit protests, and had opponents taken away by force.
[Colour and emphasis added.]
Herodians supported not just the Judean monarchy set up by Herod I, but also his general policies and strategy:
keep close to Rome and so merit Roman military support for Herodian rule; Romanise Judean society and culture; as Levantine society was largely Greek in culture and the lingua franca of Rome was Greek, this meant in effect to forcibly make Judean society Greco-Roman and recognise the divine authority of the Roman emperor (and his family).
Observant Jews in Judea worshipped at the (Second) Temple in Jerusalem:
Herod built temples for various pagan gods to serve the gentile populations, which were paid for by heavy taxes on the local Jewish population. But his masterpiece was the Temple of Jerusalem. The old temple built by Zerubbabel was replaced by a magnificent edifice. An agreement was made between Herod and the Jewish religious authorities: the sacrificial rituals, called offerings, were to be continued unabated for the entire time of construction, and the Temple itself would be



constructed by the priests. Later the Exodus 30:13 sanctuary shekel was reinstituted to support the temple as the temple tax.
The High Priests were appointed by the monarch. Jews had settled in the East - from Mesopotamia and across the Iranian empire into Greco-India - and Jewish merchants worked the trade routes by land (the Silk Road) and by sea (out of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf):
Josephus reports that at the end of the 30s CE "many tens of thousands" of Babylonian Jews guarded the convoy taking the tax to Jerusalem (Ant. 18.313).
Roman gold flowed eastwards in vast quantities in return for silk, incense, jewels and slaves (Indian sex slaves were popular and valuable).
Right: Ivory statuette of India goddess Lakshmi dated ca 1 CE. Excavated in Pompeii. Both the Herodian monarchy and Rome needed the cash accumulated in the Temple. So much Roman gold flowed east that eventually an imperial edict restricted the flow of goods westwards in an effort to save Roman gold. Roman gold coins are still found in Afghanistan, Pakistan and across India:
Like in the north where the chronology of Indian archaeology was fixed by correlating the artifacts and sites on the basis of the known contact with the west, Wheeler desired to establish similar datum-line, for the South. This was to be provided by the Roman trade contacts in coastal India. His search took him to the coastal site Arikamedu in the French colony of Pondicherry, where along with the known horde of Roman coins, Wheeler discovered Roman ceramics.

A noted merchant was Marcus Julius Alexander, a son of Antonia Minor's estate manager:
Marcus with his brother followed their father into business, becoming partners in an import-export firm. The Petrie Ostraca, mentions Marcus’ activities at Myos Hormos and Berenice Troglodytica, ports located in the Red Sea between 37-44. He had agent called Hermias, who represented him at an unnamed port.
Marcus’ father and Herodian King Agrippa I were long time friends. Agrippa I as an elegant way to give something back to Alexander the Alabarch, who supported Agrippa I in the past, arranged for his daughter princess Berenice to marry Marcus. In 41, Marcus married Berenice as her first husband. This marriage shows that there were good relations between Marcus’ family and the Herodian Dynasty.
As the First Jewish-Roman War approached (in the decade of the 60s) and Judean society divided along was appeared to be clear lines - observant, messianic Jews versus the Greco-Roman and Herodian - some parties were caught in the middle. This was especially true for the religious leaders appointed by the increasinglyunpopular monarchy.
High Priest under Herodians and Romans
Ishmael ben Fabus 58-62 (restored?) Joseph Cabi ben Simon 62-63 Ananus ben Ananus 63 He is most well known as the high priest who allegedly ordered the execution by stoning of James the Just, according to the surviving fragments of The Antiquities of the Jews. However, popular opinion against Hanan due to this act led the recently appointed Roman governor Lucceius Albinus to depose the high priest, after only three months...Josephus in The Jewish War considered Ananus "unique in his love for liberty and an enthusiast for democracy" and as an "effective speaker, whose words carried weight with the people".
Identified by Eisenman as 'The Wicked Priest' in the Dead Sea Scrolls:
After this confrontation in Caesarea in the early 40's (and those that follow between Greeks and Jews throughout the next decade), comes the assassination of "the High Priest Jonathan" in the 50's, accompanied by Josephus' first introduction of "the Sicarii" whom he accuses of being responsible for it. This "Jonathan", it should be appreciated, was the brother of that "Ananus" ("Ananus ben Ananus" - the second "Ananus" above) responsible for the death of James, as Josephus describes it; and it is their father "Annas" (sic) whom, the Gospel of John 18:13-24, pictures as interviewing Jesus before sending him bound to "Caiaphas". (Eisenman, Paul's 'Comrade-in-Arms' Epaphroditus and the First Gospels)
Joshua ben Damneus 63 In the Antiquities of the Jews (Book 20, Chapter 9) first-century historian Josephus states that Jesus ben Damneus was made high priest after the previous high priest, Ananus son of Ananus, was removed from his position for executing James the Just. Jesus ben Damneus himself was deposed less than a year later. Joshua ben Gamaliel 63-64-his wife Martha belonged to family of Boethus Mattathias ben Theophilus 65-66
The authoritative body of Judaism was the Sanhedrin (and Great Sanhedrin):
The Sanhedrin (Hebrew: סַ נְ הֶ ְד ִרין sanhedrîn, Greek: Συνέδριον, synedrion, "sitting together," hence "assembly" or "council") was an assembly of twenty-three to seventy-one men appointed in every city in the Land of Israel.



The Sanhedrin met in a building known as the Hall of Hewn Stones (Lishkat ha-Gazit), which has been placed by the Talmud and many scholars as built into the north wall of the Temple Mount, half inside the sanctuary and half outside, with doors providing access both to the Temple and to the outside.
As a 'supreme court' with power over the king, it was necessary for the Herodian monarchy to use its power over the High Priest and its authority over the cities and town which sent men to the Sanhedrin, to ensure that this assembly obeyed its will. Josephus - one of the most notable traitors to the Jewish cause - describes how High Priests and others had stayed inside Jerusalem when the Roman siege began, then escaped to be welcomed by the Roman army:
Some also there were who, watching a proper opportunity when they might quietly get away, fled to the Romans, of whom were the high priests Joseph and Jesus, and of the sons of high priests three, whose father was Ishmael, who was beheaded in Cyrene, and four sons of Matthias, as also one son of the other Matthias, who ran away after his father's death, and whose father was slain by Simon the son of Gioras, with three of his sons, as I have already related; many also of the other nobility went over to the Romans, together with the high priests. Now Caesar not only received these men very kindly in other respects, but, knowing they would not willingly live after the customs of other nations, he sent them to Gophna, and desired them to remain there for the present, and told them, that when he was gotten clear of this war, he would restore each of them to their possessions again; so they cheerfully retired to that small city which was allotted them, without fear of any danger. But as they did not appear, the seditious gave out again that these deserters were slain by the Romans, which was done in order to deter the rest from running away, by fear of the like treatment. This trick of theirs succeeded now for a while, as did the like trick before; for the rest were hereby deterred from deserting, by fear of the like treatment.
3. However, when Titus had recalled those men from Gophna, he gave orders that they should go round the wall, together with Josephus, and show themselves to the people; upon which a great many fled to the Romans. These men also got in a great number together, and stood before the Romans, and besought the seditious, with groans and tears in their eyes, in the first place to receive the Romans entirely into the city, and save that their own place of residence again... (Josephus, The War of the Jews, VI)
One of the most important objectives of the Herodians and their Roman allies was to utterly destroy - annihilate messianic Judaism, then replace it with a new form, something Greco-Roman and which would not subvert imperial authority. This is Rabbinic Judaism, with its synagogues replacing the Temple - Pharisees and Sadducees gone, replaced by rabbis - and it began with 're-education' centres:
After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70, the Sanhedrin was re-established in Yavneh with reduced authority. The imperial Roman government and legislation recognized it as the Palestinian Patriarchate, the ultimate authority in Jewish religious matters. The seat of the Patriarchate moved to Usha under the presidency of Gamaliel II in 80 CE. In 116 it moved back to Yavneh, and then again back to Usha. It moved in 140 to Shefaram under the presidency of Shimon ben Gamliel II, and to Beit Shearim and Sepphoris in 163, under the presidency of Judah I. Finally, it moved to Tiberias in 193, under the presidency of Gamaliel III (193–230) ben Judah haNasi, where it became more of a consistory, but still retained, under the presidency of Judah II (230–270), the power of excommunication.
These synagogues began appearing across Roman Palestine and the Levant, with the zodiac and the Greek sun god Helios at their centre.

Priesthood
The various sources describe three, different priesthoods during the (Second) Temple period:
The Sadducees were a sect or group of Jews that were active in Judea during the Second Temple period, starting from the second century BCE through the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. The sect was identified by Josephus with the upper social and economic echelon of Judean society. As a whole, the sect fulfilled various political, social, and religious roles, including maintaining the Temple. The Sadducees are often compared to other contemporaneous sects, including the Pharisees and the Essenes. Their sect is believed to have become extinct sometime after the destruction of Herod's Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE...
Unfortunately, these (surviving) sources are unreliable - two are Josephus and Philo, who are either Herodian and/or Chrestian; the sources are also contradictory; modern scholarship also has differing opinions. All three groupings disappeared during the three Jewish-Roman Wars. This is the claim of Josephus, which includes a description of a man he calls Banus:
These sects are three: - The first is that of the Pharisees, the second that Sadducees, and the third that of the Essens, as we have frequently told you; for I thought that by this means I might choose the best, if I were once acquainted with them all; so I contented myself with hard fare, and underwent great difficulties, and went through them all. Nor did I content myself with these trials only; but when I was informed that one, whose name was Banus, lived in the desert, and used no other clothing than grew upon trees, and had no other food than what grew of its own accord, and bathed himself in cold water frequently, both by night and by day, in order to preserve his chastity, I imitated him in those things, and continued with him three years. So when I had accomplished my desires, I returned back to the city, being now nineteen years old, and began to conduct myself according to the rules of the sect of the Pharisees, which is of kin to the sect of the Stoics, as the Greeks call them. (Life)
None of these groups matches perfectly that led by the Teacher(s) of Righteousness, though the Essenes are probably meant to represent the priestly sect at Qumran. Josephus with Banus is suspiciously similar to Saul penetrating Qumran as an agent provocateur, in which case Banus is probably James.
And I, the Instructor, have known you, my God,
through the spirit which you gave to me,
and I have listened loyally to your wonderful secret
through your holy spirit.
You have opened within me
knowledge of the mystery of your wisdom,



the source of your power. (Teacher of Righteousness in the Hymn scroll HT-XX)
TEACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS (Heb. מוֹ ֶרה צֶ דֶ ק moreh ẓedek), the organizer of the *Qumran community or *Yaḥad. His designation may have been derived from such biblical passages as Hosea 10:12, "it is time to seek the Lord, till He come and cause righteousness to rain [yoreh ẓedek] upon you," or Joel 2:23, "rejoice in the Lord, your God; for He giveth you the former rain in just measure" – et ha-moreh li-ẓedakah, which has sometimes been translated "teacher of righteousness" (see AV margin). He is never indicated by his personal name, so far as can be told from surviving records; it has been suggested that his name was Zadok, and that it was for this reason that his followers were called*Zadokites (so H.J. Schoeps, Urgemeinde, Judenchristentum, Gnosis (1956), 74); but this is uncertain. Knowledge of him is derived from two principal sources the Zadokite Fragments (or Book of the Covenant of *Damascus) and various Qumran commentaries on books or sections of the Bible.
For the history of the two other groups during the wars and the decades of confused violence leading to them, they seem to have divided along the same two lines as the rest of the nation: observant Jews who were largely messianic, and those chosing the Greco-Roman lifestyle. Josephus makes clear his contempt for the former:
8. Hereupon they sent for one of the pontifical tribes, which is called Eniachim, and cast lots which of it should be the high priest. By fortune the lot so fell as to demonstrate their iniquity after the plainest manner, for it fell upon one whose name was Phannias, the son of Samuel, of the village Aphtha. He was a man not only unworthy of the high priesthood, but that did not well know what the high priesthood was, such a mere rustic was he! yet did they hail this man, without his own consent, out of the country, as if they were acting a play upon the stage, and adorned him with a counterfeit thee; they also put upon him the sacred garments, and upon every occasion instructed him what he was to do. This horrid piece of wickedness was sport and pastime with them, but occasioned the other priests, who at a distance saw their law made a jest of, to shed tears, and sorely lament the dissolution of such a sacred dignity.
9. And now the people could no longer bear the insolence of this procedure, but did all together run zealously, in order to overthrow that tyranny; and indeed they were Gorion the son of Josephus, and Symeon the son of Gamaliel, who encouraged them, by going up and down when they were assembled together in crowds, and as they saw them alone, to bear no longer, but to inflict punishment upon these pests and plagues of their freedom, and to purge the temple of these bloody polluters of it. The best esteemed also of the high priests, Jesus the son of Gamalas, and Ananus the son of Ananus when they were at their assemblies, bitterly reproached the people for their sloth, and excited them against the zealots; for that was the name they went by, as if they were zealous in good undertakings, and were not rather zealous in the worst actions, and extravagant in them beyond the example of others. (Josephus, War of the Jews IV, Chapter 3)
(Josephus always makes clear that he is not writing as a histrian, but as a player, an active political mparticipant on the Herodian side.)
By the end of the Third Jewish-Roman War, messianic Jews in the empire were either dead, or enslaved. Few Herodians were attracted to the new, Rabbinic Judaism (they would have been able to see it as an imperial construct for a political end). Saul went his own way to found a Greco-Roman Church, which we may term Chrestian, for Chrest is found in the archaeology of the early churches and the nomina sacra are rooted in the Ptolemaic faith (and so can be termed Chrestian).
Saul's family understood the need to be covert: his forebear General Costobarus was (probably) executed by Herod I for conspiracy:
1. His first transgression to become known (but the second to be initiated) was to approach Cleopatra to ask Antony for Idumæa to be transferred to her (instead of to Herod), as it “had always belonged to her ancestors”. Costobarus was “ready to transfer his loyalty to her”, and hoped that he himself would eventually become its ruler. Cleopatra did ask: but Antony refused. 2. ... Salome added the third revelation (but the first and longest running transgression): Costobarus had been protecting, for twelve (or ten) years past, Herod’s enemies from the early days - the sons of Baba.



The loyalty of Saul's (Idumaean) family was to Cleopatra VII, from whom Chrestianity flowed; they were also the hereditary high priests of Kos, which in imperial times was a solar divinity (understood in Greek culture as Helios); as forced converts, their Judaism was questionable, which is why he never expressly termed himself
explicitly Jewish, but (according to the NT): a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews.
Right: Helios in his chariot, early 4th century BCE, Athena's temple, Ilion.
The historical record describes Saul as a thug persecuting messianic Jews; the NT describes Saul persecuting Christians (originally Chrestians) and is thus a parody; in the Dead Sea Scrolls he penetrated the Qumran monastery under James the Righteous Teacher and is labelled The Spouter of Lies; he lead the gang killing "Stephen":
Now Saul heartily approved of putting Stephen to death. That day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and everyone except for the apostles was scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria. (Acts 8:1)
This "Stephen" is actually James, attacked on the Temple steps, then killed extra-judiciously in 62 CE):
As Hans-Joachim Schoeps had already surmised, the stoning of Stephen has in precisely the same way supplanted the stoning of James (actually a conflation of James' ultimate stoning at the command of Ananus and an earlier assault by Saul on the temple steps preserved as a separate incident in the Recognitions). The name Stephen has been borrowed from a Roman official beaten by Jewish insurgents whom Josephus depicts ambushing him outside the city walls. Why this name? Because of a pun: Stephen means "crown" and was suggested both by the "crown" of long hair worn by the Nazirite (which James was, according to early church writers) and by the crown of martyrdom. To Stephen has been transferred James' declaration of the Son of Man at the right hand of God in heaven, as well as James' "Christlike" prayer for his persecutors. (Eisenman might have noted, too, that the martyr's original identity as James the Just is signaled by Acts 7:52, "the Just, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become"!) (Robert Eisenman's JAMES THE BROTHER OF JESUS: A Higher-Critical Evaluation by Robert M. Price)
Though the textual tradition claims its first bishop much later, correspondence retrieved from the Cave of Letters identifies the first bishop - Chrestian no doubt - as Julia Crispina (episkopos), a Herodian princess early in the reign of Hadrian.



Her father, Berenicianus, was the last male heir of the Herodian dynasty. Her grandmother Berenice:
After her husband died in 48, she lived with her brother Agrippa for several years and then married Polemon II of Pontus, king of Cilicia, whom she subsequently deserted. According to Josephus, Berenice requested this marriage to dispel rumors that she and her brother were carrying on an incestuous relationship, with Polemon being persuaded to this union mostly on account of her wealth. However the marriage did not last and she soon returned to the court of her brother. Josephus was not the only ancient writer to suggest incestuous relations between Berenice and Agrippa. Juvenal, in his sixth satire, outright claims that they were lovers.
Affair with Titus
It was during this time that Berenice met and fell in love with Titus, who was eleven years her junior. The Herodians sided with the Flavians during the conflict, and later in 69, the Year of the Four Emperors—when the Roman Empire saw the quick succession of the emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius—Berenice reportedly used all her wealth and influence to support Vespasian on his campaign to become emperor.



The Herodian dynasty was rife with such incest, which became one of the the foremost objections for observant Jews. Her alliance with Titus, who commanded the destruction of Jerusalem - and in this was accompanied by his best friend, Tiberius Julius Alexander - places her firmly in the Chrestian camp; her efforts to make Vespasian emperor are matched by Alexander the Alabarch, father of Tiberius Julius Alexander.
These are all very unattractive people, never to be trusted in anything, with anyone, for any reason; they are the historical personages praised in the New Testament, while in reality they are Chrestians, the tools of Antonia Minor and her minions.
The Chrestians manipulate imperial Rome to do their fighting, so only two main parties are actually in combat: observant Jews fighting Roman soldiers; the Herodians step back, off the stage - most go to live in the best, most expensive quarters in the city of Rome, some to Pompeii (which is a holiday resort) and select Chrestians are offered great estates in Egypt, to live off the fat of the land. Some become bishops and many are later adopted by the Roman Church as saints.
Notes on Yavneh:
e) The Yavnean "Academy" as the Successor of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin
Only the Babylonian Talmud and a late Midrash expressly state that the Yavnean "academy" or court was the direct successor of the Jerusalem sanhedrin." According to b.R.H. 31b, the sanhedrin went from Jerusalem to Yavneh and from Yavneh to Usha. Songs R. 8:9 explains the "vineyard" in Yavneh as a metaphor for the sanhedrin, so called "because they sat in rows and groups like the plantation of a vineyard' :s' Yet tannaitic literature already describes the Yavnean "academy" in terms that could later lead to such an assumption. M. Yad. 3:5 and 4:2 par. M. Zeb. 1:3 transmit statements attributed to R. Shimon b. Azzai who refers to rulings which he allegedly received from the "seventy-two elders on the day on which they seated R. Eleazar b. Azariah in session [nrartz]". Zucker takes the references to the number of elders literally and concludes: "Die Akademie in Jawne hat die gleiche Organisation wie der groBe Gerichtshof in Jerusalem". It is more likely, however, that the seventytwo elders are deliberately used as a typological reminder of the Jerusalem sanhedrin here. By attributing the title "Rabbi" to post-70 sages only, by describing Yochanan's relocation at Yavneh as the foundation of the rabbinic movement, by presenting his enactments as new authoritative rulings for post-Temple times, and by refraining from identifying post-70 rabbis with any of the pre-70 Jewish "sects", the editors of the Mishnah and of ARN created the impression that the rabbinic movement was a new phenomenon of post-destruction times. Continuity with the past, on the other hand, was only claimed with regard to outstanding individual figures such as Moses and a revered institution such as the sanhedrin. Both of these latter claims served to legitimate rabbinic authority.

R. Simeon continues with a description of the situation of the Kabbalists: "And they are at the edges (beshulei; or, alternatively, beshurei — in the rows] of the vineyard!" The expression "the edges of the vineyard," which has no parallel anywhere else, is somewhat obscure. I think that here the variant reading, "rows," is to be preferred. It alludes more clearly to the gathering at Yavne referred to in the Talmud as the "vineyard of Yavne"; as noted elsewhere in the Zohar, it was the situation described there, namely, that "in the future the Torah will be forgotten in Israel," which the Idra was meant to remedy, and it was, indeed, precisely because "they have violated Your Torah," and "the reapers of the field are few," that the need to convene the Idra arose. The phrase "the rows of the vineyard" would thus allude to the explanation offered by the rabbis as to why the meeting of the Sanhedrin at Yavne was called the "vineyard of Yavne": "A 'vineyard': this is the Sanhedrin... For when we say "the vineyard of Yavne," we do not mean that they sat in a vineyard, but rather the Sanhedrin is so-called because it was arranged in rows like a vineyard."

Evidence-based history
The orthodox history of this period is backward looking, interpreting selective data through the beliefs of later times. With reliable dating to establish a secure chronology, the perspective offered here does the opposite, following the development of ideas through the archaeological record of successive generations.
We approach the information tabula rasa, in a scientific manner, with no prior judgements or biases. The archaeological record is allowed to speak for itself as much as possible. Similarly, expert opinion is often quoted where appropriate, linked to the source.
The introduction provides a brief summary, based on our reading of the evidences. Excavations are on-going, new artefacts (including texts) come to light and as we gain both new technologies and better methods, so we should expect more. Though much evidence has been destroyed over the centuries, there is good reason to be optimistic for better, more complete interpretation in future.

Julia Crispina, first-ever bishop
Julia Crispina, first-ever bishop
The Church of England consecrates today its first female bishop, the Reverend Libby Lane, in a ceremony at York Minster.
The Established Church in England thinks this is new; archaeology long ago revealed the first bishop to be a woman; from my main site, we have Covert Herodians:

Julia Crispina was termed an episkopos in legal documents; this word is the basis for bishop:
A bishop (English derivation[a][1][2][3] from the New Testament Greek ἐπίσκοπος, epískopos, "overseer", "guardian") is an ordained or consecrated member of the Christian clergy who is generally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight.
That the textual tradition tells us how bishops came later is of little import to me; here, we are dealing with artefactual evidence and Chrestianity.
There are many points I could make of this, though if you're following me (Antonia Minor, the anthropology of the Chrestian Church, the role of a bishop, the orphan Jesus and his parentage, why Roman troops camped on the cliff top above the cave, et cetera, et cetera), you can easily work them out for yourself.
More difficult is to work out the relationship between Julia Crispina, the woman Grapte named in other legal documents of hers found in the cave, the Grapte palace in Jerusalem (when this Grapte is a member of the Adiabene royal family - i.e. a relative of Izates), and the woman Grapte appearing in The Shepherd of Hermas (in the original New Testament). This is how our study requires a lot of work.

Ritual pool excavated at Qumran.
Christianity claims (in its textual tradition) to be rooted - historically and theologically - in Judaism, yet be also separate; this separateness is accounted for by the stance attributed to Saul/Paul:
The New Testament accounts of Saul's conflict with the Apostles describe how Saul converted men and women of Greek culture to a form of Judaism, but without teaching/insisting on these converts following Jewish law. It was his attempting to take these 'Greeks' into the (Second) Temple that caused such a violent reaction that he was taken into Roman custody.
Perhaps the most critical issue facing a male convert to Judaism was circumcision and Saul taught that this was not needed:
he now believed that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but that the new creation is what
counts in the sight of God,[Gal. 6]and that this new creation is a work of Christ in the life of believers, making them
part of the church, an inclusive community of Jews and Gentiles reconciled with God through faith.[Rom. 6:4](Paul the Apostle)
Secular, modern scholarship has begun to place this in its proper, historical context:
Paul's basic attempts to found a community where both Greek and Hebrew — or as he puts it sometimes, "Jews first, but Greeks as well" (cf. Rom 3:22, 1 Cor 12:13, etc.) — enjoy equal promises and privileges, spiritual or otherwise, and consonant soteriological equity, are well documented. This cosmopolitanism is based on a more



easy-going attitude towards the Law (as opposed to Qumran's and James' strict constructionist, "not one jot or tittle" approach); the ideal of justification by faith alone (as opposed, for instance, to the insistence in lQpHab 8 upon the Law as a prerequisite for justification); an open hostility to circumcision which undoubtedly found a sympathetic response from such "Asian" rulers as Antiochus of Commagene, Monobazus' mother Helen of the sistering state of Adiabene, Azizus of Emesa, who married Drusilla after he was circumcised only to have her divorce him, and Polemos of Cilicia whom Bernice divorced after he was circumcised (which Josephus tells us he did on account of her great "riches"); and an easy-going approach to dietary matters — as Paul puts it in 1 Cor 9:19ff. in his discussion of the terms of James' "Jerusalem Council" directives, despite his somewhat disingenuous protests about not wishing to be the cause of his brother's "stumbling": "do not be afraid to eat anything sold in the butcher-shops; there is no need to raise questions of conscience" ("conscience" in his view being a euphemism for the Law: cf., his allusion to vegetarianism like James' as "weak").
Sometimes in allusions such as being a "Jew to the Jews," "running the race to win," etc. (1 Cor 9:19ff.), Paul even appears to turn this around to "Greeks first, but Jews as well." (Paul as Herodian by Robert Eisenman, JHC 3/1 (Spring, 1996), 110-122.)
This archaeological point of view - for Eisenman is a very fine archaeologist who has studied the Dead Sea Scrolls and their context - is gaining ground in scholarship:
Where did Luke find his raw material for the prophecy of Agabus of a great famine to transpire in Claudius' reign, of Paul's trip from Antioch to deliver famine relief funds to Jerusalem, and for the earlier tale of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch? Again, from Josephus (though perhaps also from other cognate sources of information). It all stems, by hook and by crook, from the story of Helen, Queen of Adiabene, a realm contiguous and/or overlapping with Edessa, whose king Agbar/Abgarus some sources make Helen's husband. Helen and her son Izates converted to Judaism, though initially Izates refrained from circumcision on the counsel of an unnamed Jewish teacher who assured him the worship of God was more important than circumcision. His mother, too, advised against it, since his subjects might resent his embracing of such alien customs. But soon a stricter Jewish teacher from Jerusalem, one Eliezer, visited Izates, finding him poring over the Genesis passage on the Abrahamic covenant of circumcision. Eliezer asked if Izates understood the implications of what he was reading. If he did, then why did he not see the importance of being circumcised? And this the prince then agreed to do. Helen and Izates proved the sincerity of their conversion by, among other philanthropies, sending agents to Egypt and Cyrene to buy grain during the Claudius famine and to distribute it to the poor in Jerusalem.
These events have left their mark in the New Testament as follows. Eisenman notes (as of course all commentators do) that there is no room for the famine relief visit in Galatians' itinerary of Paul's visits to Jerusalem, but he ventures to place the event during Paul's sojourn in "Arabia," which in the parlance of the time could include Edessa/Adiabene. Acts knows two Antiochs, those in Pisidia and Syria, but there were others, including Edessa! Eisenman identifies Paul as the first Jewish teacher who tells Izates he need not be circumcised if he has faith in God. (This episode also lies at the basis of the Antioch episode recounted in Galatians, when ce rtain men from James arrived in Antioch to tell Paul's converts they must be circumcised after all.) Paul is one of Helen's agents to bring famine relief to Jerusalem, which he is said to do "from Antioch," in Acts 11. (Robert Eiseman's JAMES THE BROTHER OF JESUS: A Higher-Critical Evaluation by Robert M. Price, Drew University)
This is how, to understand the historical origins of the New Testament, it is important to gain an appreciation of Helen and Izates, and their conversions to Judaism. This has an importance beyond Christianity:
1. In the early days of the Roman Empire, practicing some form of Judaism became widespread. We recognise some of these groups more readily than others, leading to some confusion in archaeological analyses. 2. The question of Jewish identity arises: what is a Jew and how should Judaism be understood? As Second Temple Judaism disappears with the Roman holocausts, Rabbinic Judaism grows and synagogues appear with the zodiac and Helios/Sol at its centre. Synagogues are built and their officers have Greek titles. Jewish tombs have occupants with Greek names.



3. The early Roman Empire periodically wars with the Parthian Empire, but who are the Parthians in this period and in the early 1st century, what is their relationship with Izates/Adiabene? If we don't know the historical identity of Izates, a convert to Judaism and a supporter of Messianic Judaism in Qumran, then the traditional history of these Roman-Parthian wars would remain mysterious. 4. Later, many in the Arabian peninsula converted to Judaism and this area also contained Jewish refugees from the Roman persecutions. What impact these Jews and their faith may have had on the instigation of the Arab Conquest is largely speculative.
We therefore are obliged to try to understand the lengthy biographies for Izates and Helen in the chronicles of Josephus, the history of their descendants, and how they were later portrayed (largely in religious terms).

Hadrian the Chrestian - Origins of Christianity
13-16 minutes
Hadrian as Pontifex Maximus - pontiff.
I promised some time ago to address this, so apologies for taking my time, during which I concluded: the argument hardly needs to be made as the facts speak for themselves (which is always my aim).
Our starting point is Chrestianity, for which the archaeology is readily apparent in the first century. (The first chapter of the book I'm writing catalogues and describes it.) From the outset - the inscription for Antonia Minor, her famous husband, Drusus, and Jucundus (the banker of Pompeii, whose house has a statue provided by Felix, the freedman of Antonia Minor and who became prefect of Judaea) - we see clearly and indisputably how Chrestianitybegins as a new religion of the ruling class of the Roman Empire and concerned with Judaea.
Near the end of the first century, Chrestians are so ensconced within the imperial court that they can commit another assassination (as they had with Nero): that of Domitian on 18 September 96:
Domitian was assassinated on 18 September 96, in a palace conspiracy organized by court officials.[Jones (1992), p. 193] A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius, who alleges that Domitian's chamberlain Parthenius was the chief instigator behind the conspiracy, citing the recent execution of Domitian's secretary Epaphroditus as the primary motive.[Grainger (2003), p. 16][Suetonius, Life of Domitian 14;16] The murder itself was carried out by a freedman of Parthenius named Maximus, and a steward of Domitian's niece Flavia Domitilla, named Stephanus.[Grainger (2003), p. 19] (Domitian, Assassination (96))



25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. ((King James)/Philippians)
The cause was probably Domitian's execution of Chrestians (e.g. Titus Flavius Clemens), including Epaphroditus for assassinating Nero.
Epaphroditus, Sosthenes, Apollos, Cephas and Caesar
Now look at the assassin's employer:
Flavia Domitilla was daughter of Domitilla the Younger by an unknown father, perhaps Quintus Petillius Cerialis. She married her cousin, the consul Titus Flavius Clemens. Dio reports:[Epitome of Cassius Dio, 67.4]
Domitian slew, along with many others, Flavius Clemens the consul, although he was a cousin and married to Flavia Domitilla, who was also a relative of the emperor's. The charge brought against them both was that of atheism (ἀθεότης), a charge on which many others who drifted into Jewish ways were condemned. Some of these were put to death, and the rest were at least deprived of their property. Domitilla was merely banished to Pandateria (Ventotene).
As a Christian saint
Flavia Domitilla is a saint in the Greek Orthodox Church, which celebrates her feast day on 12 May. And also as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, which honoured her on 12 May together with Saints Nereus and Achilleus, in whose church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo in Rome, her supposed relics were housed. (Flavia Domitilla (saint))
We know of these Chrestians because Christianity did not yet exist, so when later a person of the first century is described as Christian, the claim is either completely spurious, or the person is a Chrestian; anyway, once the character of Chrestianity is understood, many Chrestians are easy to identify (they are the bad guys, or goodfellas).



Part of Hadrian's cartouche - UC16580 (Petrie Museum).
Hadrian - though he may be thought of as a person of the second century - is of the first century, born in 76. He was 20 when Domitian was killed and already in public service. His travels across the Levant, both in service and privately, put him in good contact with numerous of the important people from Greece to Egypt, especially priests (of which one is Plutarch, priest of the Delphic temple), and the polymath Ptolemy, who I regard as a Ptolemy (if you catch my drift).
Look at who he was: a grecophile from childhood, when the Greek/Greco-Roman world was turning violently against Judaism in general and messianic Judaism in particular. His personal life was to excess - a perfect Chrestian.
To see Hadrian as a Chrestian, there are these pointers, remembering how Chrestians regarded messianic Judaism as the major threat to Rome's provincial rulers in the Levant:
His holocausts against Jews - his role in the Second Jewish-Roman War and his instigation of the Third. His destruction of Jerusalem and building of Aelia Capitolina atop; his erasure of Judaea. His sacrifice of his catamite, Antinous, then his resurrection, in a ceremony mimicking that of Osiris.
The first two show how he enacted Chrestian strategy, so whether he was Chrestian, or not, he acted as one.
Antinous as Osiris, found in the ruins of Hadrian's villa during the 18th century
The third shows how he adopted the same Ptolemaic syncretisms as Chrestianity. This particular ritualistic, ceremonial drowning in the Nile of Antinous and his subsequent resurrection (in many thousands of 'pillars of the church'), is a primary link between the Egyptian ritual of Isis and Osiris enacted on the Nile riverbank each year, and Chrestian baptism. Before this, we do not know of baptism; after, baptism is the foundation stone of Chrestianity and when baptisteries begin to appear across the empire. This is one more indicator that the gospel story (which is Chrestian in origin) is post-Antinous.



Isis, in the form of a bird, copulates with the deceased Osiris. At either side are Horus, although he is as yet unborn, and Isis in human form
More speculatively, one could ask if Chrestians played a role in Hadrian becoming emperor. I would guess 'yes', especially given the process by which that happened. Chrestians arranged for Vespasian to become emperor - the alabarch who was also the estate manager of Antonia Minor used both his money and his control of the grain supply from Egypt to that end.
We will end by looking briefly at the man employed by Hadrian to superintend the destruction of Jerusalem, the building of Aelia Capitolina and the banishment of Jews from that city - enactments which instigated one of the holocausts:
Aquila of Sinope
AQUILA Άκύλας, (1) a Jew from Rome, who with his wife Prisca or Priscilla had settled in Corinth, where Paul stayed with them (Acts xviii. 2,3). They became Christians and fellow-workers with Paul, to whom they seem to have shown their devotion in some special way (Rom. xvi. 3, 4). (2) A native of Pontus, celebrated for a very literal and accurate translation of the Old Testament into Greek. Epiphanius (De Pond. et Mens. c. 15) preserves a tradition that he was a kinsman of the emperor Hadrian, who employed him in rebuilding Jerusalem (Aelia Capitolina, q.v.), and that he was converted to Christianity, but, on being reproved for practising pagan astrology, apostatized to Judaism. He is said also to have been a disciple of Rabbi ’Aqiba (d. A.D. 132), and seems to be referred to in Jewish writings as עקילס . Aquila’s version is said to have been used in place of the Septuagint in the synagogues.
Let us take a quick look at this Priscilla, because she is also presented as a Christian:
Priscilla and Aquila were a first century Christian missionary married couple described in the New Testament and traditionally listed among the Seventy Disciples. They lived, worked, and traveled with the Apostle Paul, who described them as his "fellow workers in Christ Jesus".[Rom. 16:3 NASB] Priscilla and Aquila are described in the New Testament as providing a presence that strengthened the early Christian churches. Paul was generous in his recognition and acknowledgment of his indebtedness to them.[Rom. 16:3-4] Together, they are credited with instructing Apollos, a major evangelist of the first century, and "[explaining] to him the way of God more accurately". [Acts 18:26] While it is never stated, it has been conjectured, in light of her apparent prominence, that Priscilla held the office of teacher. She is thought by some to be the anonymous author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. (Priscilla and Aquila)
Prisca, often written in the diminutive form Priscilla, was a 2nd century C.E. foundational leader and prophet of the religious movement known today as Montanism based in the Phrygian towns of Pepuza and Tymion.
Saint Prisca was a young Roman woman allegedly tortured and executed for her Christian faith. The dates of her birth and death are unknown. She is revered as a pre-schism Western saint and martyr by the Orthodox Church and as a saint and a martyr by the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion. Though some legends suggest otherwise, scholars do not believe she is the Priscilla (Prisca) of the New Testament couple, Priscilla and Aquila, who were friends of the Apostle Paul. (Saint Prisca)



The earliest known depiction of the Eucharist, in the Catacombs of St. Priscilla, Rome. Second century CE.
The Catacomb of Priscilla on the Via Salaria in Rome, Italy, is situated in what was a quarry in Roman times. This quarry was used for Christian burials from the late 2nd century through the 4th century. Some of the walls and ceilings display fine decorations illustrating Biblical scenes. The Catacombs of Priscilla are believed to be named after Priscilla, a member of the gens Acilia and who was probably the wife of the Consul Acilius who became a Christian and was killed on the orders of Domitian. (Catacomb of Priscilla)
This Acilius is another Chrestian:
Manius Acilius Glabrio was the name of a Roman consul in AD 91, conjointly with Trajan, who was afterwards emperor. He belonged to one of the noblest families of Rome, and no fewer than nine men sharing his name held the consular office. As he was of great strength and activity, he was commanded by Domitian to descend into the arena and fight a huge lion. He slew the animal, and was greeted with so much applause, that he roused the jealousy of the emperor, who first banished, and then put him to death on some false pretext. According to Suetonius, the emperor caused several senators and ex-consuls to be executed on the charge of conspiring against the empire -- quasi molitores rerum novarum, "as contrivers of revolution" (Domit., c. x), which in Glabrio's case was adhering to the Christian religion. Xiphilinus, speaking of the executions of AD 95, says that some members of the imperial family and other persons of importance were condemned for atheism, as having embraced the Christian faith. After his death, his body was brought to Rome, and buried on the Via Salaria, in the catacomb of Priscilla.
(Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91))
Also for Aquila:
ONKELOS AND AQUILA (second century C.E.), two translators of the Bible, the one into Aramaic and the other into Greek, both of whom were proselytes. Although there is no doubt of their separate existence, the translation of Onkelos being preserved in its entirety, and that of Aquila in fragments (see *Aramaic (Middle Aramaic) and *Bible, Translations), the similarity of the names has caused considerable confusion. Similar or identical incidents are given in the Babylonian Talmud and the Tosefta as applying to Onkelos, and in the Jerusalem Talmud and the Palestinian Midrashim to Aquila (Akilas). It is therefore convenient to treat both of them primarily as one, while indicating where possible where they can be distinguished from one another. Fact and legend are inextricably interwoven. According to Epiphanius, Aquila was a native of Pontus and a relative of the emperor *Hadrian, who in about 128 appointed him to an office connected with the rebuilding of Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina. The Midrash (Tanḥ. 41a, Mishpatim 3) also refers to him as the son of the sister of Hadrian...
He is a pagan Roman, a relative of Hadrian, a Jew and when there were no Christians, one of those, too. (A part of Jewish legend because the Herodian ruling dynasty was nominally Jewish, like Saul/Paul.) Here is his constellation, entwined with that of Antinous - they were originally the other way about, with Antinous riding Aquila:



The former constellation Antinous was merged into Aquilla in 1930, but both can be seen in this 1825 chart from Urania's Mirror. The star catalogue of Ptolemy is the only known astronomical work of Antiquity to mention Antinous.
If Aquila is historical, then he too is Chrestian. We see here that these people are all in a Chrestian milieu together with Hadrian.
Known nowadays as one of the "Good Emperors", there has been speculation that Hadrian was a Christian:
Finally, after his return to Rome from Africa, he immediately set out for the East, journeying by way of Athens. Here he dedicated the public works which he had begun in the city of the Athenians, such as the temple to Olympian Jupiter and an altar to himself; and in the same way, while travelling through Asia, he consecrated the temples called by his name.* * They were later called simply "Hadrian's temples," and it was asserted that he had intended to consecrate them to Christ; see Alex. xliii.6. They were, in fact, temples dedicated to the cult of the emperors, including Hadrian himself, who was worshipped in the cities of Asia Minor as well as in the Olympieion at Athens. In inscriptions he has the cult-name Olympios or Zeus Olympios. (Historia Augusta, published in the Loeb Classical Library, 1921)
Hadrian's adopted son and successor is Antoninus Pius and I think he is later misrepresented as Pope Pius; Chrestians now ruled Rome in comfort and security.

Tropaion to crucifixion - Origins of Christianity
7-8 minutes
We've discussed purported Christograms before:
Chi-Rho is not a Christogram Tau Rho staurogram - also not a Christogram
These claims are late - that is, much later than when either the Chi-Rho or Tau Rho appear, even in the modern era; they appear before Christianity, though they are concurrent with Chrestianity.
The Chi-Rho is Ptolemaic, then adopted by Constantine I the Great in the 4th century; I interpret it as an abbreviation for Chrest/Chrestos/Chrestiani.
Here we will look at how the Tau Rho became associated with the tropaion, which is:
A tropaion (Greek: τρόπαιον, Latin: tropaeum), whence English "trophy" is an ancient Greek and later Romanmonument set up to commemorate a victory over one's foes. Typically this takes the shape of a tree, sometimes with a pair of arm-like branches (or, in later times, a pair of stakes set crosswise) upon which is hung the armour of a defeated and dead foe. The tropaion is then dedicated to a god in thanksgiving for the victory.The tropaeum in Rome, on the other hand, would probably not be set up on the battle-site itself, but rather displayed prominently in the city of Rome. A tropaeum displayed on the battlefield does not win votes, but one brought back and displayed as part of a triumph can impress the citizens (who might then vote in future elections in favor of the conqueror) or the nobles (with whom most aristocratic Romans of the Republican period were in a constant struggle for prestige).The symbolism of the tropaeum became so well known that in later eras, Romans began to simply display images of them upon sculpted reliefs (see image and Tropaeum Traiani), to leave a permanent trace of the victory in question rather than the temporary monument of the tropaeum itself.
The armour of the defeated includes the helmet:



A Roman tropaion in process of erection. Detail from the Gemma Augustea, circa 20-30 CE.
The lower scene, in which the figures are less readily identifiable, depicts the erection of atropaion.
The man is bound with his hands behind his back, and both are apparently about to be tied to the base of the as yet halferected tropaion. The trophy consists of a wooden cross, designed to support human clothing. A helmet is placed on top, and the breastplate and weaponry of the enemy is placed upon it. In the scene, four young men are raising the trophy into a vertical position.
Identification of the figures in the two scenes are particularly relevant to the study of Chrestianity:
Others, though, think that Figure #8 is Germanicus, son of Drusus.[4] If the gem was commissioned no earlier than A.D. 12 and referred to Tiberius’ triumph over the Germans and the Pannonians, it would stand to reason that Germanicus, born in 13 B.C., was old enough to don gear and prepare for war, years after his father’s death. Germanicus was also looked upon quite fondly by Augustus and others.
Drusus is the husband of the leading Chrestian, Antonia Minor and both are mentioned in the inscription CIL VI 24944 as Chrestians.
This is how the tropaion can look on a coins:



Just as the tropaion relates to the Tau Ro, so obviously both relate to the crucifixion (of IS Chrest in the original gospels); a Christian interpretation:
We have learned how the NT is an imperial work parodying the messianic Jews who fought and lost the three Jewish-Rome Wars. Use of the tropaion as the Tau-Rho in the early texts reinforces the parody.
Another, academic view (again confusing the later Christ for the contemporaneous Chrest):



Change Christ to Chrest as per the archaeology and that is a good interpretation.
Note too how crosses are appearing in Armenia and Syria - the home of Chrestianity, especially after imperial Roman conquest.
Chronology
To interpret all this, we need a chronology. My interpretation of how the tropaion was used is that it re-entered fashionable use with Octavian/Augustus and the early empire - the Principate (27 BCE – 284 CE).
As I date source Q of the gospels as necessarily post-Hadrian/Antinous; Bardaisan finding his inspiration in the events of the late-3rd century; both the Dura fragment and Dura baptistery to the early-3rd century; we should look toPapyrus 75:
It uses a staurogram in Luke 14:27.
The discovery of 75 has had a profound effect on New Testament textual criticism, due to its great agreement with Codex Vaticanus.
It is dated:
The handwriting is a clear uncial which when compared to other papyri dates the manuscript to sometime between 175 and 225 C.E.
Broadly, P75 is a product of the Principate, and we can see it as part of that new genre I date to ca 215, which includes Travels of Apollonius of Tyna, Acts of Thomas and others.
Please note (again) how none of the early texts mention a Jesus Christ, though some mention Chrest, an undeniable fact which identifies nomina sacra and Christograms as Chrestian. But to be Chrestian in the early-3rd century, the gospel story of Bardaisan must have been made imperial: the empire was chasing Bardaisan, killed his friend the king of Osroene and took over the state:
Upon his death in 212 AD,[1] Abgar the Great was succeeded by his son Abgar IX surnamed Severus in contemporary Roman fashion. Though Abgar Severus was summoned with his son to Rome in 213 AD and
murdered at the orders of Caracalla.[2] A year later Caracalla ended the independence of Osroene and incorporated it as a province into Roman Empire.
A scholarly view today is the king executed in Rome is Abgar the Great.



The chronology is essential, delineating a developing theology in conjunction with changes in imperial politics:
1. Source Q uses the trials of 'Jesus' Barabbas and 'Jesus' Chrest to claim how Izas stole Osroene from its rightful monarch (putting Pontius Pilate in charge of the trial). 2. Imperial Rome (the Severans, with Julia Domna & Co.), ensconced just down the road from Edessa in Emesa, reacts to this effrontery by criminalising both source Q and the monarchy of Osroene. 3. The Severans remake source Q as the gospels, this time making the divine man a trophy of imperial Rome.
This process of Romanisation continues with the New Testament, using every opportunity to parody their enemy in the JewishRoman wars; Osroene is now an irrelevancy, made into an imperial province, its leaders as dead as the messianic Jews they both opposed.
The need for the Tau Rho as a symbol also fades, to be replaced by the Chi-Rho.
There is, clearly.more to this than these few facts and interpretations, for - as an example - the NT also contains the Pauline textual tradition, which is Chrestian. I would offer that it is the addition of this tradition, which originally would have contained no mention of 'Jesus' simply because its divine man is the resurrected Saul (who became Saint Paul). To combine these two very different traditions to make the NT took the might of the imperial court.

The tropaion - and Julius Caesar as 'Jesus Christ' - Origins of Christianity
3-3 minutes
The Gospel of Caesar
Documentary film about a linguist (Francesco Carotta) and a Catholic priest, who search for and find the origins of Christianity and the real historical Jesus: Julius Caesar, Divus Gaius Julius Caesar, Christus
I am grateful for being given the links to the above video and author, whose hypothesis is, I think, even more substantial than that of Atwill's Caesar's Messiah, discussed earlier. I followed that critique with this: Tropaion to crucifixion - which looks at how this Roman trophy may relate to the Tau Rho in texts (falsely) claimed as 'early Christian'.
First, I think we all should admit how the raising of this trophy is uncannily like the raising of the crucifix:
Carotta has taken this thinking about the tropaion much further and, frankly, further than I'm willing to go. I've read enough conspiracy theories to recognise an undisciplined scrabbling for anything to support it; such argument has, to my mind, become a hallmark of unreality.
That said, Carotta places the tropaion on solid ground and, as far as I'm concerned, the scholars who dismiss him with an imperial, disdainful wave would probably react the same to anyone and anything which threatened their complacent (self-serving) faith.
The Gospel of Caesar



A fully erected Roman tropaion with shackled and adorsed seated male and female Sarmatian captives. Dupondius from reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, 161-180 CE.
My criticism has the exact same basis I used against Caesar's Messiah, the Jesus Never Existed website and Carrington's Flavian conspiracy: they all depend on the Christian textual tradition. Whoops!
I will repeat: there is no reliable evidence for either Jesus Christ, or Christianity in the 1st century. So, whatever imperial Rome did at that time, it was not to invent Jesus Christ, or Christianity, or to make Julius Caesar into Jesus Christ; that is impossible. I recognised years ago how Julius Caesar may well be associated in some way with Christianity, but as I didn't know how, I've not made any such claim.
The sad failure of these hypotheses is a direct result of failing to recognise good archaeology (for Chrest and how the Chrestian enemies were the messianic Jews termed The Poor), and of falling headfirst into the glittering web of false assumptions that is the textual tradition.
Sorry, but to untangle the Gordian Knot of Christian origins requires more work, more suspicion, less easy acceptance of assumptions, and facts - lots of them.

The Textual Tradition
Each of the major religions has this similarity: their origins have no historicity. The
textual tradition for Christianity starts - if we accept the dates (based on paleography)
with "Christ" and Christianity first appearing in the historical record in the 6th century.
The Christian textual tradition is in two parts: destruction of Chrestian records across
the empire, and alteration of Chrestian sacred texts.

Christian peer review - Origins of Christianity
16-20 minutes
We all rely on the system of peer review to protect us from - broadly - harm.
Peer review is the evaluation of work by one or more people of similar competence to the producers of the work (peers). It constitutes a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. In academia peer review is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication.
We don't, after all, want science to be confused with mythology, fraud, or any type of error or dishonesty. When flying on an aircraft, for example, you don't want the calculations used to design it to include a miracle, or other superstitious nonsense.
Of the various types of peer review, my study is most concerned with the scholarly:
Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) deciding whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected.
Before we examine this in more detail and as regards this study, we must admit that the process is not without its critics:
Criticism of peer review
Various editors have expressed criticism of peer review.[Rennie D, Flanagin A, Smith R, Smith J (March 19, 2003). "Fifth International Congress on Peer Review and Biomedical Publication: Call for Research". JAMA 289 (11): 1438. doi:10.1001/jama.289.11.1438.][Horton, Richard (2000). "Genetically modified food: consternation, confusion, and crack-up". MJA 172 (4): 148–9. PMID 10772580.]
Of these criticisms, these two seem most apt (emphasis by me):
Allegations of bias and suppression
The interposition of editors and reviewers between authors and readers may enable the intermediators to act as gatekeepers.[54] Some sociologists of science argue that peer review makes the ability to publish susceptible to control by elites and to personal jealousy.[55][56] The peer review process may suppress dissent against "mainstream" theories.[57][58][59] Reviewers tend to be especially critical of conclusions that contradict their own views,[60][61] and lenient towards those that match them. At the same time, established scientists are more likely than others to be sought out as referees, particularly by high-prestige journals/publishers. As a result, ideas that harmonize with the established experts' are more likely to see print and to appear in premier journals than are iconoclastic or revolutionary ones. This accords with Thomas Kuhn's well-known observations regarding scientific revolutions.[62] A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.[63]
Assumption fallacies during advocacy
Peer review advocates often assume that anyone criticizing peer review "must" have a particular pet theory they have never got published in peer review journals. They also assume that it must be their sole reason for criticizing peer review. This way, peer review advocates commit logical fallacies of a kind that jeopardize falsifiability, ignoring the fact that peer review can be criticized for general ineffectiveness without any one particular pet theory.

Further: Good science does not have to be published in the peer-reviewed literature. Groundbreaking scientific books, like Darwin's Origin of the Species or Newton's Principia were not published in peer-reviewed journals.[Problems with Peer-Review: A Brief Summary by Casey Luskin, February 10, 2012]
Now to be more specific, personal even. One factor alone stops me submitting work to professional archaeology journals: the demand that for dates, I must use Anno Domini and Before Jesus Christ:
Dates should be quoted AD/BC (or ad/bc if radiocarbon). (Notes for Contributors, current archaeology)
You understand that as the whole of my point is to contradict Christian tradition and historicity, that demand would make it impossible for me to submit.
Where else could I go? What about BAR: Biblical Archaeology Review? I am not a biblical scholar and I do not accept validity of the term 'biblical archaeology'. Even so, I asked about the process and was told that after submitting, to wait a year at least. They too use Anno Domini and Before Jesus Christ.
There are, of course, a mass of theological journals on biblical matters. The problem with them is peer review, because of who owns and edits them. Here's one:
Centre for the Study of Christian Origins
The Centre for the Study of Christian Origins (CSCO) was established to promote research on the emergence and developments in Christianity in the first two centuries of the common era.
Initial purposeThe main initial purpose in establishing the CSCO was to link relevant researchers in the University of Edinburgh and beyond, so that lines of research convergence can be identified and fostered. It is hoped that the trans-confessional and trans-disciplinary nature of research on Christian origins will be demonstrated and facilitated. CSCO represents a particular concern to bridge the study of the New Testament and second-century Christianity. It provides a means of linking interested scholars in several traditional disciplines, such as:
New Testament/Christian Origins Patristics Roman History Archaeology Second-Temple Judaism Palaeography
This is not unique to Edinburgh, for all our oldest universities were first established as religious, Christian institutions. For all the later additions, the departments of divinity and theology remain. And you see my problem: the very basis for this institution is opposed to my history.
The guardian of this particular gate - Edinburgh - has been and probably is still Larry Hurtado:
Larry Hurtado (born 1943) is a New Testament scholar, historian of early Christianity and Emeritus Professor of New Testament Language, Literature and Theology at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland (Professor 1996-2011). He was the Head of the School of Divinity 2007-2010, and was until August 2011 Director of the Centre for the Study of Christian Origins, at the University of Edinburgh. He was elected a member of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas in 1984, and received the Rh Institute Award for Outstanding Contributions to Scholarship and Research in the Humanities in 1986. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2008, and President of the British New Testament Society from 2009 to 2012. He has won research grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the British Academy, and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK). He has given invited lectures in many universities in the UK and other countries, and was a Visiting Fellow at Macquarie University in Australia in 2005. (Larry Hurtado)
He is, naturally, a strong defender of his peer review (and in equally-strong measure, critical of those outside his magic circle):
...genuinely scholarly claims are submitted for review by other scholars competent to judge matters. This scholarly critique should form part of doing a PhD, with supervisor(s) and examiners assessing the validity of the thesis as it progresses and then is submitted for examination. This is why a PhD in the field is a good earmark of someone with competence and also someone who understands the scholarly process. (Peer Review and Biblical Studies Scholarship, Larry Hurtado, October 21, 2013)



In my opinion, he knows nothing of early Christianity, accepting, as he does, the textual tradition which I describe as mythological and largely fraudulent, and the historicity of a first-century "Jesus Christ". He continues the Christian claims over pagan symbols (both the New Testament abbreviations also known to Christian scholars as nomina sacra, and the Chi-Rho. He is not my peer by any stretch of the imagination and I regard his institute as a shelter for apologists. Ask him to consider anything I write? It would be a joke in poor taste.
This brings us to my point: peer review in this field cannot work, for it is owned by Christian institutions, managed by Christians whose work is to support the (false) textual tradition and the New Testament as a sacred, god-given collection of work. I do not respect their qualifications - they might as well be experts in Lord of the Rings, pretending it is all historical.
No university is more prestigious than Oxford.
While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest surviving university. (The University of Oxford)
It began as a religious institution, to teach clerics, and has always retained its religious character.
As early as 1193, Alexander Neckham from St Albans gave biblical and moral lectures on the Psalms of David and the Wisdom of Solomon. One of the first university buildings was the Divinity School, begun in 1423 specifically for theology lectures. (Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford)
The History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century by T H Aston, Clarendon Press, 1994
This is the system of education Britain exported across the world, ensuring how the textual traditions of other religions have also been accepted as historical in a sort of "I won't question yours if you don't question mine" approach.
Now, look at how I describe myself: a shovelbum - a bum with a shovel; I am not writing a dissertation, nor am I a professor, or any other academic. For half a century, I've had a desire to learn what happened in the first century and since I more-or-less achieved that, I've been curious to learn how divine men of the Roman Empire were conjured into existence. Whatever answers I've come up with are a revelation to me, for I had little or no preconceptions (I was too ignorant, for neither am I a classicist): I've been drawn to them just by following the basic rules of archaeology and historiography..
I live and work mainly in England thus, by English law and English governance. This is not a secular state, for we have long had an Established Church with bishops living in palaces, with chauffeur-driven limousines (whilst describing themselves as The Poor), and sitting in parliament's Upper House. Virtually all our major institutions are Christian and many are by royal charter, and this includes major universities and the British Museum. Our monarchy is made "special" through baptism (which is Greek Magic) and secret consecration. I checked how our school curriculum treats Christianity and eventually found a requirement to treat the New Testament as historical. Our powers that be are unlikely to tear down the pillars that hold themselves aloft over us; they have a studied disinterest - at best - in anything I have to say.



Bishop Christopher Hill was awarded (a Lambeth) Doctor of Divinity by Archbishop Justin Welby in recognition of his significant contribution to the life of the church over many years. (2014)
The archbishop of Canterbury awards academic degrees as he sees fit:
The Lambeth Degree is a real academic award. The candidates are exempt from both residential and examination requirements and the awards are made, on merit, in recognition of their particular contributions to religious, academic and public life. The Archbishop of Canterbury’s right to grant degrees of the realm is derived from the Peter’s Pence Act of 1533 which empowered the Archbishop to grant dispensations previously granted by the Pope. (Archbishop of Canterbury awards Lambeth Degrees)
Although these are commonly termed “Lambeth Degrees”, the Archbishop is not a university and the degrees he awards are full degrees of the Realm. The Archbishop is noted as an institution authorised to award degrees in a Statutory Instrument made under the 1988 Education Act. (Lambeth Degrees)
...a Degree of the Realm, which can only be awarded to subjects who take the Oath of Allegiance to the monarch of the United Kingdom (Lambeth degree)
There is no real peer-review in the field I study; having a degree in unicorns farting rainbows, writing in support of magic and a false textual tradition carry no weight, but rather repel me. So this irks some - as it should, especially all those who bow to authority (in religion, or - frankly - in any field).
My series of theses - for a new religion, Chrestianity, for the absence of Christianity until at least the medieval period, for the Christian textual tradition being fake, for Christianity misappropriating from other and earlier religions, people and events - and my demands for changes in methodology, such as the need to date manuscripts more reliably, for the need for historians to follow the rules of historiography and for archaeologists to think more for themselves rather than follow historians who do not apply the same rules, seem to set me apart from everyone else.
Let me make clear, I do not claim to be brighter, or better educated than others; my arguments may well have some holes in them; others certainly could present my arguments better than can I (and in recent years I lost some of my mental capacity due to strokes). None of this makes any difference to how right, or wrong I may be. I am either on the right track, or not; if I am on the right and others on the wrong, then their better arguments cannot compensate for their errors.

All the evidences look to me as though Alquin of York, along with other northern British clerics, convinced the illiterate Charles I as to how good it would be to recreate the Roman Empire; they understood how that empire had and utilised a strong, theological framework, but the existing papacy was not in a position to replicate the role of emperor and his court; Chrestianity was being proven to be an inadequate bulwark against the Arab Conquests. The conflicts between the Eastern and Western Empires needed to end; the old world of the Roman Empire needed unity. I think it was in this situation that the need for Christianity was realised and effected.
The problem for us, now, is that the states of the resultant Christendom codified and institutionalised this new religion; in the fashion of imperial Rome and as they built anew, they also remade history as they expunged the original records. Worse, these new institutions would protect themselves as they defended the state, so we arrive in the modern world corrupted.
All I've done is look at a series of cultural layers, observed what is there and tried to interpret; I refuse to describe what is not there.
My book submission has been well received by the publisher's editorial committee and I am now working on the remainder. It isn't literature, but it is the best I can do.

Dating sacred manuscripts - Origins of Christianity
8-10 minutes
This fragment, containing numerous references appearing later in the New Testament, is virtually unique, in being found within a secure, archaeological layer dated to 257 CE (and the fall of the town to an Iranian army).
When I credulously believed in a "Jesus Christ" appearing in the New Testament, I was most concerned in dating the early codices (and fragments) in order to construct a reliable chronology for early Christianity. I know now that there is no such character in the original manuscripts (where the name and title are either abbreviations, or "IS Chrest"), for "Jesus Christ" was made later. Even so, we need to know:
1. When were the earliest, original manuscripts (those containing the abbreviations and/or "Is Chrest") written (then, by whom, under whose authority, and where). 2. When did "Is Chrest" become "Jesus Christ", as in both the alterations to codex Sinaiticus, and in some later bibles, which used both the Chi-Rho and "Jesus Christ".
This would provide chronologies for Chrestianity, the origin of Christianity and the period of cross-over from one to the other.
Can this be achieved, or: as it has never been done, what is stopping this?
Archaeology uses a number of methods for dating, from finding artefacts in a secure, cultural layer in which dates can sometimes to provided to a variety of artefacts and structures, to use of a wide range of technologies directly on and to the artefacts. Unfortunately, nearly all texts described as 'early Christian' were not recovered archaeologically, but passed through numerous and often unknown hands to their present owners. This leaves us with study of the textual artefacts themselves (and their associated materials).
Are there rules as to what can be done? Generally, no, for there is no central archive for them; there is no law which insists how we keep, or treat them. They are held all over the world, by a huge variety of individuals and institutions; where they are rules, they are made by their owners and those with whom they share.
The method used commonly to date textual artefacts claimed as early Christian is paleography, which I have often dismissed as pseudo-scientific. In 2011, I posted Mani and Authorship of the Canonical Gospels containing this scholarly observation:
What emerges from this survey is nothing surprising to papyrologists: paleography is not the most effective method for dating texts, particularly those written in a literary hand. Roberts himself noted this point in his edition of P52. The real problem is the way scholars of the New Testament have used and abused papyrological evidence. I have not radically revised Roberts's work. I have not provided any third-century documentary papyri that are absolute “dead ringers” for the handwriting of P52, and even had I done so, that would not force us to date P52 at some exact point in the third century. Paleographic evidence does not work that way. What I have done is to show that any serious consideration of the window of possible dates for P52 must include dates in the later second and early third centuries. Thus, P52 cannot be used as evidence to silence other debates about the existence (or non-existence) of the Gospel of John in the first half of the second century. Only a papyrus containing an explicit date or one found in a clear archaeological stratigraphic context could do the work scholars want P52 to do. As it stands now, the papyrological evidence should take a second place to other forms of evidence in addressing debates about the dating of the Fourth Gospel. (“The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel” by Brent Nongbri, Harvard Theological Review 98:23-52, 2005.) [Emphasis mine.]



The Christian apologist scholars always strive to move their sacred texts closer to their divine man.
ABSTRACT. — The date of the earliest New Testament papyri is nearly always based on palaeographical criteria. A consensus among papyrologists, palaeographers and New Testament scholars is presented in the edition of NESTLE–ALAND,1994. In the last twenty years several New Testament scholars (THIEDE, COMFORT–BARRETT, 1999, 2001 and JAROS, 2006) have argued for an earlier date of most of these texts. The present article analyzes the date of the earliest New Testament papyri on the basis of comparative palaeography and a clear distinction between different types of literary scripts. There are no first-century NewTestament papyri and only very few papyri can be attributed to the (second half of the) second century. It is only in the third and fourth centuries that New Testament manuscripts become more common, but here too the dates proposed by COMFORT–BARRETT, 1999, 2001, and JAROS, 2006 are often too early.
(Early New Testament Manuscripts and Their Dates. A Critique of Theological Palaeography by Pasquale Orsini and Willy C. Larysse, Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses 88/4 (2012))
(1) As to the reassessment of provenance, I think dissatisfaction is the order of the day. Because all of the codices passed through the hands of one or more dealers and are not associated with any secure archaeological context, the question of the provenance of the Beatty biblical papyri cannot be definitively settled. In all cases we are dealing with, at best, second- or third-hand hearsay. (2) The Pauline epistles are numbered and described separately. After a note stating that ‘The papyri numbered 6231–6237 were purchased in Egypt during the season of 1931/32’, the Pauline epistles are inventoried after that list (as number 6238): ‘Thirty papyrus leaves containing part of the epistles of Paul. IV’. It is not clear who assigned the fourth century date.

Can we fairly demand C14 testing of sacred texts? There has not been a problem with the oldest Koran manuscripts, as I have noted for that of Sana'a and more recently, that discovered in Birmingham.
The Sana'a palimpsest, dubbed Ṣanʿā’ 1, is one of the oldest Quranic manuscripts in existence.[Sadeghi & Goudarzi 2012, p. 8.]...A radiocarbon analysis has dated the parchment containing the lower text to before 671 AD with a 99% accuracy.[Sadeghi 2010, p. 353.]
Radio carbon dating found the manuscript was at least 1,370 years old, putting it among the earliest in existence. ('World's oldest' Koran: Birmingham reacts to discovery)
It is not a problem for the oldest Jewish sacred texts:
Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls refers to a series of radiocarbon dating tests performed on the Dead Sea Scrolls, first by the AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) lab of the Zurich Institute of Technology in 1991 and then by the AMS Facility at the University of Arizona in Tucson in 1994-95. There was also a historical test of a piece of linen performed in 1950 by Willard Libby, the inventor of the dating method. (Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls)
Nobody is suggesting we ban archaeology, even though it is necessarily destructive (removing a cultural layer in order to study beneath). C14 dating is destructive, though only in very small part and that part need not contain text.



Codex Sinaiticus
So why not? What is holding back our experts?
I have noticed how those arguing most determinedly against my efforts usually claim to be atheists, or skeptics, yet the counterarguments they make support the Christian apologists. The one I find most odd is to deny the historicity of the NT while using and openly supporting the textual tradition, which is largely fraudulent. The common claim is to trust authority, which is the antithesis of the scientific method. We need to date texts reliably; nothing less will do and those arguing against this are on the wrong side.
We need C14 dating, both absolute and relative, for multiple samples and by multiple laboratories, for Christian, Chrestian, Gnostic and Manichaean sacred texts.

Battle of the Pyramids, July 21, 1798, oil on canvas
Antoine-Jean Gros (1810)
Blogger keeps telling me of blogs it thinks are related to mine, here. They cover a huge range of speculations, usually offering secular, non-theist explanations for sacred texts - usually biblical. Thanks, Google, but you're wasting your analytical time, and here's why.
Few people - it seems and I hope - can still believe in gods, magic, the supernatural - the stuff of religion. (Of course some still do and some will still buy into ponzi schemes, believe Bush was right about Iraq, download viruses, follow horoscopes, buy "alternative medicine" and use 1,2,3,4,5 for a password: there are always ignoramuses, super-credulous and idiots.) But generally and at least in the world I inhabit, people are educated, literate and sensible - quite a lot are very bright, far brighter than me - and they realise that prayer doesn't wok, angels don't stand guard over us, sacred texts were all written by people, and billions of us were born into hell, with short, unpleasant lives and often painful ends.
So all that religious claptrap needs some explaining, after all, it's been around a long time and our modern world is still based on it. Our doctors and scientists are produced in many of the same, great institutions as the priests. In the UK at least, bishops still rule over us and the Roman Church still rules the lives of a billion or so.
It is only natural, then, for enquiring minds to wonder: was there ever any truth in what we were taught and if so, what could it be?
The solution for just about everyone is to go back to the books and try to make some sort of sense out of them, to rationalise 'the facts'. This is when the scholarly approach discovers that others travelled this path long before. My two favourite books on this are:
The Origin of All Religious Worship by Charles François Dupuis (1798) containing "An Explanation of the Fable, in which the Sun is worshipped under the name of Christ".
This is what happens when scientific minds liberated from religious oppression discover ancient Egypt, as happened with the French Revolution, then Bonaparte. England put a stop to all that.



The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion (retitled The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion in its second edition) by Sir James George Frazer (1890)
The Victorian period saw a great flourishing of comparative study of mythology and religion, as science advanced and travel across the world became easier. There was also a productive period in biblical scholarship.
Today, with the internet and Wikipedia, every skeptical and enquiring mind can quickly and easily see the comparisons and draw their own, usually facile conclusions. Their one hallmark - actually a hurdle over which they trip - is this: though they believe they can sort mythological gods from history, they are unable to sort mythology itself from history.
Yes, there were no historical men called Serapis, or Mithras; there really were men - from pharaohs to caesars - who (falsely) claimed divinity for themselves: that bit was easy.
This discernment begins to fall apart when reading of Pythagoras and Alexander the Great, for even most scholars have little idea that they were divine and also lack virtually all historicity.
Then what about Buddha, Krishna, Jesus Christ, Muhammad the Prophet? Now the going gets tough.
Faced with such daunting questions of historicity, the easy road beckons: go to the experts, the professors of history, the big, reliable names from leading universities and the television screen: they must know. At that point, the aspiring scholar is lost in academe's glittering web of false assumptions.
They will read of books, laws and edicts, whole histories of and from antiquity, crowded with saints, philosophers-turned saints, martyrs, popes, great theologians and heretics, schisms and apocrypha, and they are told how most of these existed. The Catholic Encylopaedia will obligingly admit that many accounts - gospels and Acts even - were faked, and this reassures - the rest must be reliable, surely!?
The poor, investigating scholar grasps what they can, not understanding, not even imagining, how they are grasping at straws. The sad fact is that history and the textual tradition are two, very separate things - and this is true for all major religions.
The proper study of history sets guidelines - rules actually - on how to treat what in the vernacular is known asgossip, or in a court of law as secondhand evidence, hearsay.
There is no direct evidence for Jesus, Christ, the life of such person, or his death; there is no direct, contemporaneous evidence for anything Christian - people, faith, or institutions - or for heresies, until centuries later in the modern era.
There is no Clement, Justin Martyr, Eusebius of Caesarea, Lactantius, or any other Church Father, or author of the textual tradition. And that also applies to the many Christians treated in the so-called histories and anti-heresies bearing their name. Not only are they all fictional, if our great scholars understood anything important for the period they claim expertise, they would realise that none could have existed. And neither could the books they were supposed to have written.
This is what sinks all our erstwhile intellectual giants, intent on explaining their brilliant hypotheses to us. They build on sand and it's very soggy.
Before anyone starts out on their great adventure, to point out to us the obvious parallels and similarities, regurgitating observations made centuries ago and better, they need to learn and adopt a methodology:
A methodology does not set out to provide solutions but offers the theoretical underpinning for understanding which method, set of methods or so called “best practices” can be applied to a specific case.
When reading an unreliably-dated ancient text claiming anonymously and with no support to be copied from an earlier - which not only does not exist, but for which there is no other evidence that it ever existed - and by an author who has no historicity at all, our putative scholar needs an accepted guideline, or rule, on how to treat it. This should not be a problem, for historiography contains such - all that is needed is to read the rule, then apply. It really is that simple.
If there were something tangible to consider, then perhaps there would be real work involved, but there very rarely is.
In my own study, for the last three or four years, I have had to check the possible historicity of every ancient source; it's been sometimes troublesome, though necessary and rewarding. The result is how come I differentiate frequently between history and the textual tradition; it is how I know my history is reliable and that of others is either cripplingly incomplete, often wrong, or just mythological and then, largely a fraud.
As historians of religions and antiquity usually cannot follow the rules of their own field, I think they need to be chucked along with the fetid, scummy bathwater they produce and call history.

Constantine I
The Christian textual tradition for this emperor of the early-4th century:
Constantine the Great (Latin: Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus; 27 February c. 272 – 22 May 337), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine, was Roman Emperor from 306 to 337.
The first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, Constantine played an influential role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan, which decreed religious tolerance throughout the empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was professed by Christians.
The medieval church upheld him as a paragon of virtue while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity.
Constantine—as the first Christian emperor—is a significant figure in the history of Christianity. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built on his orders at the purported site of Jesus' tomb in Jerusalem, became the holiest place in Christendom. The Papacy claimed temporal power through Constantine. He is venerated as a saint by Eastern Orthodox Christians, Byzantine Catholics, and Anglicans. The Eastern churches hold his memory in particular esteem, regarding Constantine as isapostolos or equal-to-apostles.



Beyond the bald facts of his existence and status, none of the claims made for him in relation to Christianity are sustainable. There is not a single piece of contemporaneous evidence for either the Edict of Milan, or the First Council of Nicaea. They exist only in the textual tradition:
The document known as the Edict of Milan (Edictum Mediolanense) is found in Lactantius' De Mortibus Persecutorum and in Eusebius of Caesarea's History of the Church with marked divergences between the two. Whether or not there was a formal 'Edict of Milan' is debatable.
The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict. It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire he had just conquered by defeating Maximin later in the same year and issued in Nicomedia.
No Christianity in Ceasarea
Further, there is neither a historical Lactantius nor Eusebius of Caesarea - they both exist only in the textual tradition of later centuries. The archaeology of Caesarea Maritima, where the latter is said to have been based, shows no evidence of a Christian Church, church, or Christianity in the late-3rd/early-4th centuries:
It will be recalled, moreover, that on the same site CCE has been studying the remains of an Early Christian church, octagonal in plan, dated to about 500 C.E.
Furthermore, discovery of numerous kurkar architectural fragments from the temple embedded in the structure both of the church and of the staircase that provided access to it from the west makes it clear that the temple still stood-certainly long unused for cult purposes, and perhaps in a ruinous state--until about 500. (From Paganism to Christianity on the Temple Platform, Kenneth G. Holum)
The main church was the Martyrion of the Holy Procopius, built in the 6th century upon the remains of the Roman temple on the podium. The octagonal, 39 m.-wide church stood within a square precinct measuring 50 x 50 m., surrounded by rooms along its walls. The floor was paved with marble slabs in a variety of patterns. Of the rows of columns in the building, several Corinthian capitals decorated with crosses were found. (Archaeology in Israel: Caesarea)
Considering the lack of Christianity in Caesarea until the 6th century at least (supposing correct interpretation of the symbolism for then), this also settles the dispute regarding the historicity of another character of the Christian textual tradition associated with that Herodian city: the fabled Origen of Alexandria:
Origen (Greek: Ὠριγένης, Ōrigénēs), or Origen Adamantius (Greek: Ὠριγένης Ἀδαμάντιος, Ōrigénēs Adamántios; 184/185 – 253/254), was a scholar and early Christian theologian...Origen left Egypt, apparently going with Ambrose to Caesarea, where he spent some time. Here, in conformity with local usage based on Jewish custom, Origen,



though not ordained, preached and interpreted the Scriptures at the request of the bishops Alexander of Jerusalem and Theoctistus of Caesarea. When, however, the confusion in Alexandria subsided, Demetrius recalled Origen, probably in 216.
Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria, at first supported Origen but later opposed him, disputing his ordination in another diocese (Caesarea Maritima in Palestine). This ecclesiastical turmoil eventually caused Origen to move to Caesarea, a move which he characterized as divine deliverance from Egypt akin to that the ancient Hebrews received.
There is, again, no historicity for this Origen. His claimed self-castration would have been illegal and is probably a reference to the practise in the Phrygian cult of Cybele, which became popular in Rome. His philosophy is derived from that of Philo (brother of the Alabarch, estate manager of Antonia Minor). The Christian Origen is almost certainly a remake of another:
The epithet “Platonist” will of course be warranted if Origen the Christian is identified with the Origen whom Porphyry represents as one of the privileged disciples of Ammonius Saccas, the Alexandrian teacher of Plotinus. According to Porphyry (Life of Plotinus, 3.20–38) this Origen swore an oath with Plotinus and a third disciple, Herennius, not to reveal the esoteric doctrines of Ammonius after the latter's death in 243 A.D. This story implies both personal intimacy and geographical proximity, yet Origen the Christian was at this time almost sixty (twenty years senior to Plotinus), had left Alexandria for Caesarea some years before, and already had a multitude of books to his name as a Christian teacher. Porphyry does not allude to these lucubrations in his Life of Plotinus, but says that the Origen he refers to breached the pact by issuing first a treatise On Daemons, then another, with the title That the King is the Only Maker, in the reign of Gallienus (253–268). (Origen, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
Platonism in this period is a form of Neopythagorean (Greek) magic and the real people mentioned in the above quotation were its high priests; this is the history of Chrestianity in this period, hidden by the Christian textual tradition.
The Council supposed to lead to the Edict of Milan is also mythological:
The First Council of Nicaea was a council of Christian bishops convened in Nicaea in Bithynia by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in AD 325.
It also exists only in the later textual tradition.
On the other hand, the Chi-Rho appears across the empire like a flood. New baptisteries are built and many examples have been found of baptismal artefacts and mosaics bearing the Chi-Rho. The obvious conclusion is that Constantine approved something and this is its symbol.
Other than the Chi-Rho, though, there is nothing else to attach Constantine I to either Chrestianity of Christianity.
Empress Helena
There is also the textual tradition for his mother:
Saint Helena or Saint Helen (Latin: Flavia Iulia Helena Augusta; c. 250 – c. 330) was the consort of the Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus and the mother of the emperor Constantine the Great, an important figure in the history of Christianity. She is traditionally credited with a pilgrimage to Syria Palaestina, during which she discovered



the True Cross of Jesus's crucifixion. She is revered as a saint by the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, the Roman Catholic, the Lutheran, and the Anglican churches.
Archaeological examination of Jerusalem fails to confirm the claims made for her purported discoveries there. Her presence in Roman Britain is better attested.:
At least twenty-five holy wells currently exist in the United Kingdom dedicated to Saint Helena. She is also the patron saint of Abingdon and Colchester. St Helen's Chapel in Colchester was believed to have been founded by Helena herself, and since the 15th century, the town's coat of arms has shown a representation of the True Cross and three crowned nails in her honour. Colchester Town Hall has a Victorian statue of the saint on top of its 50-metre (160 ft) high tower. The arms of Nottingham are almost identical, because of the city's connection with Cole (or Coel), Helena's supposed father.
Adrian Gilbert has argued that Helena traveled to Nevern in Wales and hid the True Cross near the local Norman church of St Brynach, where a cross is carved into a rock formation. Named the Pilgrim's Cross, religious pilgrims once came here to pray for visions. Names of local places are abundant with cross imagery, including River of the Empress, Mountain of the Cross, Pass of the Cross, and others. The True Cross, however, has not been found in this region. (Helena (empress) - Depictions in British folklore)
The 4th century sees the Greek Magic (from Egypt and found across the Greco-Roman world) transform into Gnosticism.
The Greek Magical Papyri (Latin Papyri Graecae Magicae, abbreviated PGM) is the name given by scholars to a body of papyri from Graeco-Roman Egypt, which each contain a number of magical spells, formulae, hymns and rituals. The materials in the papyri date from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD.
Greek Magic
We now have numerous Gnostic texts - gospels, Acts, Apocalypses and so on - which relate in some ill-defined manner to the books of the New Testament. The Chi-Rho appears to have opened the floodgates to mysticism , magic and divine men.



Left: The Hinton St Mary Mosaic
Dorset, England, Roman Britain, 4th century CE
This magnificent mosaic was discovered buried beneath a field in the village of Hinton St Mary, Dorset, in 1963.
There were traces of a substantial building complex, probably including the remains of a villa. The mosaic was part of the bestpreserved wing. The walls on either side had been demolished, probably in the post-Roman period. The mosaic was designed as a continuous floor in two panels for one large room divided by a pair of short cross-walls.
The smaller panel contains a central roundel which shows the hero Bellerophon mounted on his winged horse, Pegasus. He is spearing the mythical three-headed monster, Chimaera, a scene perhaps intended to illustrate the triumph of good over evil. The roundel is flanked on two sides by hunting scenes showing stags pursued by hounds.
The larger panel comprises a central roundel flanked by four semi-circles. Three show similar hunting scenes and one a large, spreading tree. In the corners are busts of four male figures with windswept hair. They may represent the four Evangelists, the four winds, or indeed both.
In the central roundel is a divine man with the Chi-Rho; there is no mention of Jesus, or Christ. His image is identified by some scholars as that of Constantine I.
Chrestan New Testament
Both codices Vaticanus and Sinaiticus - the two oldest copies of the New Testament - are dated to the 4th century and neither contained Jesus or Christ; Sinaiticus was altered massively at a later date.



Christianity later claims the 4th century as its own, when imperial adoption allows it to flourish openly across the empire. The evidence used to support this claim is of two parts - Chi-Rho appearing on many, various artefacts, and the textual. Though it is true that the Chi-Rho has since been adopted as an abbreviation for Christ, there is no evidence of this in textual artefacts of the 4th century (or earlier).
The textual artefacts that claim Christianity in this century belong to the 6th and they are supported by no historicity at all. Many believe in them, including much scholarship, though this is faith, not reason.
Late sources
The same textual tradition claims that towards the end of the 4th century, with the authority of Theodosius I, another great, imperial council is held, resulting in another, important Edict for Christianity:
On 27 February 380, together with Gratian and Valentinian II, Theodosius issued the decree "Cunctos populos", the socalled "Edict of Thessalonica", recorded in the Codex Theodosianus xvi.1.2. This declared the Nicene Trinitarian Christianity to be the only legitimate Imperial religion and the only one entitled to call itself Catholic. Other Christians he described as "foolish madmen". He also ended official state support for the traditional Polytheism religions and customs. In May 381, Theodosius summoned a new ecumenical council at Constantinople (see First Council of Constantinople) to repair the schism between East and West on the basis of Nicean orthodoxy.
The problem with this is that these also have no historicity:
The Codex Theodosianus (Eng. Theodosian Code) was a compilation of the laws of the Roman Empire under the Christian emperors since 312. A commission was established by Theodosius II and his co-emperor Valentinian III on 26 March 429 and the compilation was published by a constitution of 15 February 438. It went into force in the eastern and western parts of the empire on 1 January 439.
That is, to learn what happened in the 4th, we have to look at the 5th. But how reliable is even this source?
Sources
Books 1-5 lack the level of manuscript support available for books 6-16. The first five books of the surviving Codex draw largely from two other manuscripts. The Turin manuscript, also known as "T," consists of 43, largely



discontinuous folios. The second manuscript is the Breviary of Alaric, and a good part of the Breviarium that is included in book 1 actually contains the original text of the respective part of the original codex.
The latter part of the Codex, books 6-16, drew largely from two texts as well. Books 6-8 of the Codex were preserved in the text of a document known as Parsinus 9643. The document circulated early medieval French libraries, as well as the other formative document for the latter part of the code, a document held in the Vatican (Vat. Reg. 886), also known as "V". Scholars consider this section to have been transmitted completely.
We see that much is missing. What of the Brevarium?
The Breviary of Alaric (Breviarium Alaricianum or Lex Romana Visigothorum) is a collection of Roman law, compiled by order of Alaric II, King of the Visigoths, with the advice of his bishops and nobles. It was promulgated on 2 February 506, the 22nd year of his reign.
That brings us to the 6th century, when the Christian textual tradition was composed. The claims for Christianity in the 4th have no historicity.

Eusebius of Caesarea as myth - Origins of Christianity

Caesarea Maritima
Much of the claimed history for Christianity - and its relationship with imperial Rome - during the first three centuries of the modern era, derives from texts appearing centuries later; they claim to be copies of texts originally written by:
Eusebius (Greek: Εὐσέβιος; 260/265 – 339/340 AD; also called Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius Pamphili), was a Roman historian, of Greek descent, exegete and Christian polemicist. He became the Bishop of Caesarea about A.D 314. Together with Pamphilus, he was a scholar of the Biblical canon and is
regarded as an extremely well learned Christian of his time.[1] He wrote Demonstrations of the Gospel, Preparations for the Gospel, and On Discrepancies between the Gospels, studies of the Biblical text. As "Father of Church History" he produced the Ecclesiastical History, On the Life of Pamphilus, the Chronicle and On the Martyrs.
This character is termed here a "ghost" because he left no footprint in the historical record; that is, looking at the cultural layers of the period in which he is supposed to have inhabited, there is no mention, or any other mark of him. As a prime example, archaeological study of the site in which he is supposed to have his episcopate (the see of a bishop) shows further how there was no Christian church there at that time and no Christian congregation.
In short, this character did not exist and could not have existed. Further, the very earliest texts attributed to this fictional character appear at least two centuries late. Note: the textual tradition, as with sacred texts, are very largely undated by any scientific, or reliable method; Christians try continually to move them back in time towards these "ghosts"; very possibly, the textual tradition is (much) more recent than claimed.
Caesarea Maritima
From 6 CE this port city was the centre of Roman administration in Judea:
Caesarea Maritima (Greek: Parálios Kaisáreia, Παράλιος Καισάρεια) is a national park on the Israeli coastline, near the town of Caesarea. The ancient Caesarea Maritima (or Caesarea Palestinae) city and harbor was built by Herod the Great about 25–13 BCE. The city has been populated through the late Roman and Byzantine era.
Caesarea Maritima was named in honor of Augustus Caesar. The city was described in detail by the 1st-century Roman Jewish historian Josephus. The city became the seat of the Roman prefect soon after its foundation. Caesarea was the "administrative capital" beginning in 6 CE...The emperor Vespasian raised its status to that of a colonia. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Caesarea was the provincial capital of the Judaea Province, before the change of name to Syria Palaestina in 134 CE, shortly before the Bar Kokhba revolt...After the revolt of Simon bar Kokhba in 132, which ended with the destruction of Jerusalem and expulsion of Jews, Caesarea became the capital of the new Roman province of Palaestina Prima.
Right: the Pilate Stone - (replica casting on display in Caesarea Maritima) - the name given to a damaged block of carved limestone with a partially intact inscription attributed to, and mentioning, Pontius Pilate; a Prefect of the Roman-controlled province of Judea from 26–36 CE. The translation from Latin to English for the inscription reads:



To the Divine Augusti [this] Tiberieum
...Pontius Pilate
...prefect of Judea
...has dedicated [this]
The Christian, textual tradition for this imperial, Roman centre:
According to the Acts of the Apostles, Caesarea was first introduced to Christianity by Philip the Deacon, who later had a house there in which he gave hospitality to Paul the Apostle. It was there that Peter the Apostle came and baptized Cornelius the Centurion and his household, the first time Christian baptism was conferred on Gentiles. Paul's first missionary journey. When newly converted Paul the Apostle was in danger in Jerusalem, the Christians there accompanied him to Caesarea and sent him off to his native Tarsus. He visited Caesarea between his second and third missionary journeys, and later, as mentioned, stayed several days there with Philip the Deacon. Later still, he was a prisoner there for two years before being sent to Rome.
In the 3rd century, Origen wrote his Hexapla and other exegetical and theological works while living in Caesarea. The Nicene Creed may have originated in Caesarea.
As the capital of the province, Caesarea was also the metropolitan see, with ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Jerusalem, when rebuilt after the destruction in the year 70.
The team documented the rock cuttings on the promontory and began digging the one preserved side of the building: the east range of rooms. The results suggested a luxuriously-appointed building of some 110 x 55m...The dramatic siting of the building, its walls battered by the surf, provided the strongest evidence that the palace was Herod's, recalling his palaces at Masada, Jericho and Herodium...in the Roman period, the triclinium and its rooms were provided with a small caldarium, whose hypocaust and furnace were well-preserved. A tile used in the furnace bears the stamp of the Tenth Legion Fretensis. Atop destruction debris in the southernmost room of the east wing, excavators found two inscribed marble columns with six dedicatory inscriptions. These revealed important new information about officials of Caesarea from the 2nd-4th c. A.D., including a previously unattested "curator of ships of the colony of Caesarea."
At the bottom of well, a cache of some 60 lead defixione, or curse tablets, were recovered during wet-sieving. These tablets and an associated assemblage of coins, dating to the 4th c. A.D...
We see how this Roman centre was manned by Roman troops and administrators right through the period claimed by the Christian, textual tradition; whatever religions were practised there, they did not include Christianity (though Chrestianity, with its links to the Herodian monarchy and imperial Rome must be a strong possibility).



The Herodian temple, built upon a raised platform, was destroyed about a century before a church was built in the late-fifth century:
In 1998 we excavated in two areas underwater, N and K, located within or adjacent to the main basin of King Herod's great harbor, and in two areas on land, area LL, located on the north side of the Inner Harbor basin, and area TP, the Temple Platform, site of Herod's temple to Roma and Augustus.
The Temple Platform, where Farland Stanley supervises, is the site overlooking the harbor where King Herod built his temple to Roma and Augustus, mentioned by Josephus. Avraham Negev of the Hebrew University cleared the site of modern buildings and excavated there in the early 1960s but discovered little. We began excavating in 1989, after Yoram Tsafrir and I recognized the foundations of an Early Christian church among the remains that Negev left. The church, it turned out, was built squarely on the foundations of the temple. Clearly, the site has much to teach us about the process of Christianizing Caesarea, and the Roman Empire.
In TP25 and elsewhere, we likewise exposed further foundations of the octagonal church, in part heavily robbed. (32) The line of these foundations was already known, however, so other discoveries were more important. (33) In 1998 we exposed and studied a group of enigmatic foundations in TP19/23, TP1/2, and in TP25. (34) It is now clear that these foundations lay above remains of the temple and below the floors of the church. Thus the temple had been largely or completely destroyed up to a century



before the church was built. Pottery and coins found below these foundations dates them to about 400-450, and we now think the church was built about 480-500. Nevertheless, numerous stones of the temple were incorporated into church (47), so many that we can say they shared the same fabric. From what we have recovered so far of the intermediate structure, or structures, there is no sign that they formed a monumental building, such as an intervening church.
(Combined Caesarea Expeditions: 1998 Summer Season by: Kenneth G. Holum, Project Director. Copy added below) Empasis added.
To summarise the chronology:
1. "Eusebius" died 339/340 2. First church built ca. 500
The archaeology makes clear how this Herodian, then imperial Roman centre of power, could not have been a centre of an illegal, covert cult such as claimed in the textual tradition.
The hard archaeological evidence is convincing. On its northwestern flank the church foundations rest directly on the temple foundations--and in fact it may be assumed that the temple foundations survived because the Early Christian builders exploited the Herodian foundations as leveling where the bedrock sloped downward on the northwest of the site. Furthermore, discovery of numerous kurkar architectural fragments from the temple embedded in the structure both of the church and of the staircase that provided access to it from the west makes it clear that the temple still stood--certainly long unused for cult purposes,
and perhaps in a ruinous state--until about 500. The bulk of its stones must have survived until then in their original positions. This enabled the church builders to exploit the temple's superstructure as a convenient quarry for the kurkar blocks they needed for the church and staircase.
(From Paganism to Christianity on the Temple Platform by Kenneth G. Holum)
The textual tradition describes "Eusebius of Caesarea" as openly in communication with the imperial court:
(i) Eusebius succeeded Agapius as Bishop of Caesarea soon after 313 and played a prominent role at the Council of Nicaea in 325. Eusebius, a learned man and famous author, enjoyed the favour of the Emperor Constantine. Because of this he was called upon to present the creed of his own church to the 318 attendees."
(ii) The history of the preservation of the three letters, to Alexander of Alexandria, to Euphrasion, or Euphration, to the Empress Constantia, is sufficiently curious. Constantia asked Eusebius to send her a certain likeness of Christ of which she had heard; his refusal was couched in terms which centuries afterwards were appealed to by the Iconoclasts. A portion of this letter was read at the Second Council of Nicæa...(Eusebius of Cæsarea, Catholic Encyclopedia)
And yet he leaves no footprint, no mark at all of his existence? Nobody mentions him - he is a ghost.
The city had no Christian congregation in the first, second, third or fourth centuries; the city had no Christian bishop in that period.
On the other hand, Caesarea Maritima was a perfect location for Chrestians, being first, Herodian, then imperial Roman protected by Roman troops and with a port to link them with the empire.
Reliable archaeology thus expunges this "Eusebius of Caesarea" from the historical record; this tells us how the Christian textual tradition is mostly a fabrication. Most likely, the Chrestian history was remade as Christian, just as Chrest was altered to read Christ in the original New Testament.



The conversion of the emperor Constantine, the Council of Nicea, the Edict of MIlan - so much purported history - is dependent on this character (or others like him). None of these events exist in the historical record, just in the words of an unknown writer centuries later.
This also forces a review of the claimed author "Origen" (see above), as well as the vast number of characters claimed by "Eusebius" as Christian. The purported self-castration of Origen suggests, perhaps, that he was a priest of Cybele.

There were no heresies - Origins of Christianity
6-8 minutes
An important part of the Christian textual tradition is its battle against various heresies and as witness to this, there are numerous anti-heresy books/authors claimed for the early centuries.
As there is no Christian Church in this period, there could be no Christian heresies then. As the textual tradition begins in the 6th century (or later) and is a parody of imperial history - in which there was Chrestianity - so most of these purported heresies are reflections of imperial and Chrestian history, i.e. where we have reliable evidence for for what was later described as "heretical" faiths, these are likely to belong to Chrestianity.
Adoptionism is one of two main forms of monarchianism (the other is modalism, which regards "Father" and "Son" as two historical or soteriological roles of a single divine Person).
Theodotus of Byzantium (Ancient Greek: Θεoδoτoς; also known as Theodotus the Tanner, Theodotus the
Shoemaker, and Theodotus the Fuller; flourished late 2nd century) was an early Christian writer from Byzantium, one of several named Theodotus whose writings were condemned as heresy in the early church.
This "heresy" is a poor reflection of the policy of adoption implemented by the Principate:
In the Imperial period, the system also acted as a mechanism for ensuring a smooth succession, the emperor taking his chosen successor as his adopted son.
Probably the most famous adopted man in Republican times was Augustus Caesar. Born as Gaius Octavius, he was adopted (by testament) by his great-uncle Julius Caesar and acquired the name of Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (hence his common name of Octavian).
Imperial Succession
In the Roman Empire, adoption was the most common way of acceding to the throne without use of force. The second emperor, Tiberius, was the adopted son of Augustus, beginning a general tradition that the Emperor adopt his successor. During the Roman Empire's first 200 years, this tradition was common, with Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, and Lucius Verus all becoming Emperor through adoption. (Adoption in Ancient Rome)
As for the claim that the Ebionites as Christians:
Ironically, all these correspondences serve as collateral evidence for a much clearer basis for identifying early Christianity with the sect of the Scrolls. Have you ever read the truism that the Scrolls neglect to name their parent body? And yet their sect is again and again called both “the Poor” (Ebionim, Ebionites) and “the Way.” These, of course, are the earliest known self-designations of Christians, as Acts tells us, long before they were called “Christians”--by outsiders. (Robert Eisenman, The New Testament Code: The Cup of the Lord, the Damascus Covenant, and the Blood of Christ. London: Watkins. 2006. Reviewed by Robert M. Price)



The Jewish sect at Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls, led by James until his extra-judicial death in 62, calls itself The Poor Ebionites.
These texts are appropriately titled. It is important to see the extent to which the terminology Ebionim (‘the Poor’) and its synonyms penetrated Qumran literature. Early commentators were aware of the significance of this usage, though later ones have been mostly insensitive to it. The use of this terminology, and its ideological parallels, ‘Am (‘Meek’) and Dal (‘Downtrodden’), as interchangeable terms of self-designation at Qumran, is of the utmost importance. There are even examples in crucial contexts of the published corpus of an allusion like ‘the Poor in Spirit’, known from Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount in both the War Scroll, xi.10 and the Community Rule, iv.3.
It is clear from the Pauline corpus that in some sense the community following the leadership of James the just (known in the literature as ‘the brother of Jesus’, whatever is meant by that designation) - the socalled Jerusalem
Church or Jerusalem Co mmunity - were called ‘the Poor’ (Gal. 2:10; also Jas. 2:3-5). Remembering ‘the Poor’, meaning in some sense bringing a proper amount of monetary contributions back to Jerusalem, is all Paul is willing to say in Galatians above about the conditions laid down on his activities by his ideological opposite James.
As tradition proceeds, it becomes clear that the Ebionim (the so-called Ebionites) or ‘the Poor’ is the name by which the community descending from James’ Jerusalem Community in Palestine goes.
This description of the Ebionites is crucial to our understanding of these texts and the widespread use of the 'Poor' terminology at Qumran. Though there is more material from other sources about these Ebionites, they are certainly the community that held the memory of James in the highest regard, whereas Paul they considered 'the Enemy' or Anti-Christ (compare this with the terminology Mastema we are encountering in these texts).
This is proof positive that the "apostles" of the New Testament are not Christian, but Jews who went on to overthrow the Herodian monarchy and fight Rome in three wars; they can be termed "Christian" only in parody, for their enemy were Chrestians, such as Saul, Josephus and various other Herodian nobility, along with their Egyptian and Roman allies. The Observant and zealous Jews are parodied in the New Testament.
When texts which appear to most scholars as "Christian" in some manner and are dated reliably to the early centuries, then they should be regarded in the above context, as at least "chrestic". This especially includes those which appear to be versions of New Testament stories, most of which today are treated as Gnostic (e.g. some of the Nag Hammadi archive, if dated "early"). In this manner, we may gain a better understanding of Chrestianity and Christian origins.
Even with this approach, there is a danger of continuing to superimpose preconceptions, or dogma upon these ancient texts, as the Christian Church and even modern, Christian scholarship has always done. Archaeologists should never have agreed the



term 'heresy' for them, nor accepted "Jesus" for IC and "Christ" for XP without substantial, secular reasoning. What the Church termed heretical and what scholarship termed Gnostic may well be the hitherto unrecognised sacred texts of Chrestianity.

The Virgin Mary, by Josephus and Plutarch - Origins of Christianity
9-11 minutes
Paulina in the temple of Isis, by Fortunino Matania; based on the account by Josephus
In our secular world, we know that there was no Virgin Mary, so from where did the idea come? From the beliefs and rituals of the time.
I often said here how all source Q needed to know could be found in a few books around at the time, especially those of Josephus and Plutarch. From the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia entry for Isis:
The violation of the chaste Paulina in the Temple of Isis at Rome was one of the reasons for the expulsion of the Jews from that city by Tiberius (Josephus, "Ant." xviii. 3, § 4; Hegisippus, "De Excidio Hieros." ii. 4).After the destruction of Jerusalem, Vespasian and Titus celebrated their triumph in the Temple of Isis at Rome (Josephus, "B. J." vii. 5, § 4). Tiberius Julius Alexander, a descendant of the apostate and procurator (of Judea) of the same name, erected a statue to Isis at Alexandria, in the 21st year of Antoninus Pius (Schürer, "Gesch." 3d ed., i. 568, note 9). The Greeks that lived in Palestine worshiped, among other gods, the goddess Isis (ib. ii. 35). Hence it is not surprising that the Rabbis also speak of the worship of Isis; they do not mention her name, but refer to her as the "suckling" ("meniḳah"; 'Ab. Zarah 43a; Tosef., 'Ab. Zarah, v. 1); she is often represented with the suckling Horus. This specific application of "the suckling" has not been recognized in the Talmudic dictionaries of Levy, Kohut, and Jastrow.
We've seen repeatedly the Isis cult in the Roman Empire and, particularly with Isis Chreste, related it to Chrestianity:
Chrestians of Pompeii Cleopatra VII and Rome and various posts here.
The account by Josephus:
The Perils of Paulina or The Wicked Priests of Isis
(from Flavius Josephus [1st cent. A.D.], Jewish Antiquities 18.3)
4. About the same time certain shameful practices happened about the temple of Isis that was at Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the temple of Isis. There was at Rome a woman whose name was Paulina; one who, on account of the dignity of her ancestors, and by the regular conduct of a virtuous life, had a great reputation: she was also very rich; and although she was of a beautiful countenance, and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay, yet did she lead a life of great modesty. She was married to Saturninus, one



that was every way answerable to her in an excellent character. Decius Mundus fell in love with this woman, who was a man very high in the equestrian order; and as she was of too great dignity to be caught by presents, and had already rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance, he was still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised to give her two hundred thousand Attic drachmae for one night's lodging; and when this would not prevail upon her, and he was not able to bear this misfortune in his amours, he thought it the best way to famish himself to death for want of food, on account of Paulina's sad refusal; and he determined with himself to die after such a manner, and he went on with his purpose accordingly. Now Mundus had a freed-woman, who had been made free by his father, whose name was Ide, one skillful in all sorts of mischief. This woman was very much grieved at the young man's resolution to kill himself, (for he did not conceal his intentions to destroy himself from others,) and came to him, and encouraged him by her discourse, and made him to hope, by some promises she gave him, that he might obtain a night's lodging with Paulina; and when he joyfully hearkened to her entreaty, she said she wanted no more than fifty thousand drachmae for the entrapping of the woman. So when she had encouraged the young man, and gotten as much money as she required, she did not take the same methods as had been taken before, because she perceived that the woman was by no means to be tempted by money; but as she knew that she was very much given to the worship of the goddess Isis, she devised the following stratagem: She went to some of Isis's priests, and upon the strongest assurances [of concealment], she persuaded them by words, but chiefly by the offer of money, of twenty-five thousand drachmae in hand, and as much more when the thing had taken effect; and told them the passion of the young man, and persuaded them to use all means possible to beguile the woman. So they were drawn in to promise so to do, by that large sum of gold they were to have. Accordingly, the oldest of them went immediately to Paulina; and upon his admittance, he desired to speak with her by herself. When that was granted him, he told her that he was sent by the god Anubis, who was fallen in love with her, and enjoined her to come to him. Upon this she took the message very kindly, and valued herself greatly upon this condescension of Anubis, and told her husband that she had a message sent her, and was to sup and lie with Anubis; so he agreed to her acceptance of the offer, as fully satisfied with the chastity of his wife. Accordingly, she went to the temple, and after she had supped there, and it was the hour to go to sleep, the priest shut the doors of the temple, when, in the holy part of it, the lights were also put out. Then did Mundus leap out, (for he was hidden therein,) and did not fail of enjoying her, who was at his service all the night long, as supposing he was the god; and when he was gone away, which was before those priests who knew nothing of this stratagem were stirring, Paulina came early to her husband, and told him how the god Anubis had appeared to her. Among her friends, also, she declared how great a value she put upon this favor, who partly disbelieved the thing, when they reflected on its nature, and partly were amazed at it, as having no pretense for not believing it, when they considered the modesty and the dignity of the person. But now, on the third day after what had been done, Mundus met Paulina, and said, "Nay, Paulina, thou hast saved me two hundred thousand drachmae, which sum thou sightest have added to thy own family; yet hast thou not failed to be at my service in the manner I invited thee. As for the reproaches thou hast laid upon Mundus, I value not the business of names; but I rejoice in the pleasure I reaped by what I did, while I took to myself the name of Anubis." When he had said this, he went his way. But now she began to come to the sense of the grossness of what she had done, and rent her garments, and told her husband of the horrid nature of this wicked contrivance, and prayed him not to neglect to assist her in this case. So he discovered the fact to the emperor; whereupon Tiberius inquired into the matter thoroughly by examining the priests about it, andordered them to be crucified, as well as Ide, who was the occasion of their perdition, and who had contrived the whole matter, which was so injurious to the woman. He also demolished the temple of Isis, and gave order that her statue should be thrown into the river Tiber; while he only banished Mundus, but did no more to him, because he supposed that what crime he had committed was done out of the passion of love. And these were the circumstances which concerned the temple of Isis, and the injuries occasioned by her priests.
There is a good, scholarly study of this: The Lecherous Pseudo-Anubis of Josephus and the ‘Tomb of 1897’ at Akhmimby David Klotz:
The new evidence from Akhmim suggests that the Roman scandal which Flavius Josephus reported might have had an authentic cultic background; namely, priests wearing an Anubis mask would have sexual relations with women inside a temple. The preceding survey of Egyptian and Egyptianizing sources uncovered additional evidence supporting this theory. Numerous festival depictions include a priest wearing nothing but a red robe, sandals, and an Anubis mask, perhaps hinting at his imminent sexual performance. The erotically-themed Bes-chambers at Saqqara were built specifically within the Anubieion precinct, further indicating that Anubis priests were involved with local fertility rites. One might imagine that married women having trouble conceiving might have visited the Bes-chambers to be inseminated by the local clergy. By identifying the progenitor with Anubis, an otherwise taboo extramarital coupling could have been elevated to a morally acceptable religious experience. Such an arrangement would explain the Decius Mundus affair, and account for the popularity and surprising efficacy of incubation sessions.
At the same time, we have seen that Anubis was frequently invoked in erotic magical spells of the Graeco-Roman Period, having the power to enslave female objects of desire. In general, Anubis was an omnipotent medium or divine messenger, an amenable interface between mortals and the divine, and potentially with the spirits of the dead. Perhaps the scene from the ‘tomb of 1897’ represents the soul (Ba) of the deceased, channeled through the Anubis-figure, continuing to copulate with women on earth.



Intaglio 1st century BCE: Isis with Horus could be Cleopatra with Caesarion
We know that the gospel accounts drew on these sources; how Chrestianity derives from the Ptolemaic faith, particularly of Cleopatra VII; contains much Greek Magic; and with this, we have it all.

Mani Apostle of SU Chrestos
The history of Mani/Manes is so tied up within later textual traditions that little can be said with any certainty of the founder of the religion bearing his name - Manichaeism:
Until the 20th century, no reliable information on Mani's biography was known. Such medieval accounts as were known are either legendary or hagiographical...
In 1969 in Upper Egypt a Greek parchment codex dating to ca. 400 AD was discovered. It is now designated Codex Manichaicus Coloniensis because it is conserved at the University of Cologne. It combines a hagiographic account of Mani's career and spiritual development with information about Mani's religious teachings, and contains fragments of his writings.
This work and other evidence discovered in the 20th century establishes Mani as a historical individual.



Mani Apostle of SU Chrestos
Contact
He existed in the 3rd century and his father appears to have belonged to a sect which took part in regular, frequent, ritual cleansing. There is a case for them to be described as refugees from the Jewish-Roman Wars and thus, pious Jews of the type found at Qumran followers of James. The group that has survived today in that area and may well have descended from these refugees is known as Mandaean:
The emigration of early Mandaeans from the Jordan Valley took place the latest at the second century CE due to pressure from orthodox Jews. The migrants first went to Harran in Assyria and entered the southern provinces of Mesopotamia during the third century CE. It appears that Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was partly influenced by the newcomers.
His religion spread east along the Silk Road to China, and west into Syria across the border into the Roman Empire, then into Egypt and across North Africa, to become one of the world's major religions:
Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian gnostic and religious movements.
Manichaeism was quickly successful and spread far through the Aramaic-Syriac speaking regions. It thrived between the third and seventh centuries, and at its height was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire.
In recent decades, many of the texts of this religion have been discovered, from caves along the Silk Road to archaeological sites in Egypt:
Mani wrote either seven or eight books, which contained the teachings of the religion. Only scattered fragments and translations of the originals remain.
The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian Shabuhragan, his book dedicated to the King Shapuhr. In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian deities such as Ohrmazd, Ahriman, and Az. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and Soghdian (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near Turpan, in theXinjiang (Chinese Turkestan) province of China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore bar Khonai and outlined below), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new



Aramaic religious phenomena,Talmudic Judaism and Babylonian Mandaeism, which were also appearing in Babylonia in roughly the third century AD.
The original, but now lost, six sacred books of Manichaeism were composed in Syriac Aramaic, and translated into other languages to help spread the religion.
The Evangelion (Syriac: ܐܘ ܢ ; Greek, Coptic: Ευαγγελιον, meaning roughly "good news"). Also known as the Gospel of Mani. Quotations from the first chapter were brought in Arabic by Ibn al-Nadim, who lived in Baghdad at a time when there were still Manichaeans living there, in his book the "Fihrist" (written in 938), a catalog of all written books known to him. The Treasure of Life The Treatise (Coptic: πραγματεία) Secrets The Book of Giants: Original fragments were discovered at Qumran (preManichaean) and Turpan. Epistles: Augustine brings quotations, in Latin, from Mani's Fundamental Epistle in some of his anti-Manichaean works. Psalms and Prayers. A Coptic Manichaean Psalter, discovered in Egypt in the early 1900s, was edited and published by Charles Allberry from Manichaean manuscripts in the Chester Beatty collection and in the Berlin Academy, 1938-9.
Although most transliterators and translators follow the Christian textual tradition in reading Jesus and Christ in these texts, in fact neither appear. Rather:
From the opening of the Mani Epistle, found at Kellis, Egypt. We see that it spells out SU CHRESTOS.
Despite all the claims associating this faith with Christianity, there can be no such direct link Christianity has yet to come into existence; this is the period for Chrest and Chrestianity, not surprising when we see Chrest so clearly in the Mani Epistle
Who is the SU? By this time, it may be Jesus, though it could also be James:
James in Hebrew is Santiadous
This connection is speculative - nobody then reported the meaning of such nomina sacra and by the 3rd century, the textual tradition of Chrestianity was well under-way. The source of Dura fragment 24 (and the faith of the Dura baptistery) with its IC/JS is probably the School of Bardaisan and:
We must therefore see the culture giving rise to the new faiths of both Mani and Bardaisan as the same: Mesopotamian of the 3rd century. As a result of the Roman invasions of that area, from Trajan (with Hadrian) in the late-1st century to Caracalla in the early-3rd century, Chrestianity should be expected in that area, in one form or another.

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 405
Presented here as an example of how the Christian textual tradition is assembled to make unsupported claims for itself.
This is an important part of that tradition:
Irenaeus' best-known book, Adversus Haereses or Against Heresies (c. 180), is a detailed attack on Gnosticism, which was then a serious threat to the Church, and especially on the system of the Gnostic Valentinus.
He is important as purported proof for historicity: of him, of Christianity in this period, of a bishop and thus of an organised, Christian Church, and of heresies. If these claims were substantiated, this site would not have been created.
From that volume:



Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 405

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel”. When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name IC/IS.
Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.

Title: Der mogliche Text von P. Oxy. III 405, Z. 39-45 (The Possible Text of P. Oxy. III 405. 39-45)
Pages: 160
Journal: New Testament Studies
Volume: 37
Issue: 1
Abstract: Grenfell and Hunt's reconstruction of the text of P. Oxy. III 405, lines 39-45, is based on J. A. Robinson's identification of it as a fragment of Irenaeus, Contra Haereses. The papayrus text is too short, however. A clearly visible abbreviation sign leads instead to the conclusion that the text preserves a variant of Matt 1:22-25, and represents a Christianization of the LXX citation made there. (German) (c) Religious and Theological Abstracts
The observation is correct that these fragments contain no Jesus, or Christ; the usual abbreviation is used - as in all early texts claimed as Christian; they are not evidence for Christianity.
It is also correct that they are too short to be the fabled text by Irenaeus.
That this is a "variant of Matt 1:22-25" indicates that it belongs to the same category as Dura fragment 24, dated reliably to the early-3rd century.
What may we learn from that?
What became the canonical gospels were not yet formed by this period. These fragments tell us that the gospels are new and in development in the early-3rd century.
They tell us that Jesus and Christianity had yet to come into existence.
Rather than supporting, or even proving the Christian textual tradition, they undermine it. What does that tell us of the academic approach?

The myth of Arianism - Origins of Christianity
1-1 minutes
The Christian textual tradition was created to imitate that of the Roman Empire, taking events and people of other traditions for its own. One, rather obvious example is how the Roman tradition for a man to adopt a son - a tradition assumed by the early emperors - was turned into a Christian 'heresy' called Adoptionism. Another co-called heresy is Arianism - but there was neither Christianity at that time, nor a Bishop Arius: the whole episode is a fake.
Wikipedia:
Arianism is the theological teaching attributed to Arius (ca. AD 250–336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt, concerning the relationship of God the Father to the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Arius asserted that the Son of God was a subordinate entity to God the Father. Deemed a heretic...

Attis the Phrygian shepherd
Having recently published the second contribution to the section on Syncretisms - Bishop Abercius Marcellus - I just now attached this image to the page, referencing the early attempts to show that Abercius was not Christian:
Note: In the 'Book of the Dead' the Phrygian Attis is named 'Osiris, the Shepherd.' (E.A. Wallis Budge, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurection (London: Medici Society, 1911), 2:16; also, Korpel, Rift in the Clouds, 449; Fikes, Shepherd-King, 52.)
If Harnack had been aware of the wealth of Chrestian archaeology in the home province of Abercius, he would, I am sure, have identified Chrestianity as this "pagan, Gnostic sect".
I therefore attached a document (as a file for others to download) to the Syncretisms section, on Harnack and the Tubingen school. I highlighted these three passages:
He considered that from its earliest origins, Christian faith and Greek philosophy were so closely intermingled that the resultant system included many beliefs and practices that were not authentically Christian. Marcion was a leader of the Pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century, using only the Pauline Gospel, St. Luke (in its original form), and the Epistles of St. Paul (without the Pastoral Epistles). Simon Magus never existed; it is a nickname for St. Paul.
It may therefore seem that our evidence-based history for Antiquity set out in the footsteps of these 19th-century scholars; such is not the case: we began with a tabula rasa , our only assumption at the outset was for how we thought it likely that the history of Greco-India, with its tales of Thomas and Gondophares, should be linked firmly to the Greco-Roman world of the Mediterranean and in so doing, could take us somewhere interesting.
But as our study progressed, we discovered repeatedly how the Victorians had got there first. By comparison, scholarship of the 20th century seemed unadventurous, even dogmatic, forever trying to drag early texts even further back, into the early-first century. Modern scholarship seems largely to be a servant of the Church, the modern apologists.
We are not sure how the Victorian adventure ended - maybe the death and destruction of two world wars had something to do with it, although reading the detail of Harnack's later work, he seems to have been severely brow-beaten, bullied almost but not completely into submission. That's the vulnerability of a professional, dependent on others for everything, from peer-review to income.

9 and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. 10 Only, they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.
The Jewish monastery at Qumran:
Since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947-1956, extensive excavations have taken place in Qumran. Nearly 900 scrolls were discovered. Most were written on parchment and some on papyrus. Cisterns, Jewish ritual baths, and cemeteries have been found, along with a dining or assembly room and debris from an upper story alleged by some to have been a scriptorium as well as pottery kilns and a tower.
Many scholars believe the location was home to a Jewish sect, probably the Essenes. But, according to Lawrence Schiffman, the rules of the community, its heavy stress on priesthood and the Zadokite legacy, and other details indicate a Sadducean-oriented sect either distinct from or one of the various Essene
groupings.[1]
Many of the texts found in the caves appear to represent widely accepted Jewish beliefs and practices, while other texts appear to speak of divergent, unique, or minority interpretations and practices. Some scholars believe that some of these texts describe the beliefs of the inhabitants of Qumran, which, may have been the Essenes, or the asylum for supporters of the traditional priestly family of the Zadokites against the Hasmonean priest/kings. A literary epistle published in the 1990s expresses
reasons for creating a community, some of which resemble Sadducean arguments in the Talmud.[4] Most of the scrolls seem to have been hidden in the caves during the turmoil of the First Jewish Revolt, though some of them may have been deposited earlier.
This community did not give themselves a formal title, though outside, contemporaneous sources use Essenes:



...Josephus gave a detailed account of the Essenes in The Jewish War (c. 75 CE), with a shorter description in Antiquities of the Jews (c. 94 CE) and The Life of Flavius Josephus (c. 97 CE). Claiming first
hand knowledge, he lists the Essenoi as one of the three sects of Jewish philosophy
[7]
alongside the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He relates the same information concerning piety, celibacy, the absence of personal property and of money, the belief in communality and commitment to a strict observance of Sabbath. He further adds that the Essenes ritually immersed in water every morning, ate together after prayer, devoted themselves to charity and benevolence, forbade the expression of anger, studied the books of the elders, preserved secrets, and were very mindful of the names of the angels kept in their sacred writings.
The Qumran community, led by James until his extra-judicial killing in 62, and which became the enemy of Chrestianity (in the Heradian monarchy and its supporters in both Egypt and Rome) used many terms to describe itself, perhaps none better known than The Poor: Ebionites, or Ebionaioi (Greek: Ἐβιωναῖοι; derived from Hebrew אביונים ebyonim, ebionim, meaning "the poor" or "poor ones").
...what Prof. Eisenman does in this short volume is to go through what is known by scholars as "The Habakkuk Pesher" and laymen, "The Habakkuk Commentary" – "Pesher" in Hebrew having the same sense as "Commentary" in English – in a line-by-line, passage-by-passage fashion; and meticulously set forth just how they can relate to known events, ideas, and happenstances known from and associated with the life of James or as all Early Christian accounts would have it: "James the Just" (the cognomen, “the Just One” of course, being at all times all-important) or “James the Zaddik”.
As everyone knows, he has expanded this in two 1000+ page books since: James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls (1997-98) and The New Testament Code: The Cup of the Lord, the Damascus Covenant, and the Blood of Christ (2006) and two shorter ones: James the Brother of Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls I and II (2012 and 2013); but these two initial volumes represent his first forays into this territory. Once again, despite the impression by a few critics, who try make light of or marginalize his theories or scholarship (as if they could produce anything better); as in MZCQ, he absolutely distinguishes between "the Spouter of Lies” or “Lying” (the so-called “Liar” or “Scoffer” – for Eisenman, a more accurate translation of this last being “the Jester”) and "the Wicked Priest"; and this dichotomy has withstood the test of time and initiated a host of imitators.
Not only does he make it clear – despite some simplistic “Consensus” theorizing – that these two are utterly different; but, in doing so, he absolutely confirms through internal analysis a First Century CE date for principal Qumran original Documents (called by so-called ‘consensus scholars’, “Sectarian”), a position he already basically set forth in MZCQ. The first, of course, is an internal ideological Adversary of the hero of the Scrolls, "the Righteous Teacher" – “the Liar” who "denied the Law in the midst of their entire Congregation" – the second, the present Establishment High Priest and this, definitively not a “Maccabean” but the reigning “Herodian” one.
It is he who is responsible for the death or destruction of "the Righteous Teacher" and some of those with him – called revealingly “the Poor" – “the Ebionim" in the Hebrew of the Scrolls and very probably equivalent to "the Ebionites" of Early Church History about whom Eusebius in the 4th Century is so contemptuous and scathing of.
The Poor is neither a Chrestian, nor Christian group; it is Jewish through-and-through - Observant, pious, and desperate to free both itself and Judea from outside influences (whether Greek or Roman):
The term Ebionites derives from the common adjective for "poor" in Hebrew (singular: אֶ בְ יוֹן ev·yōn, plural:
,) ev·yōn·im אביונים
[10][11][12]
which occurs fifteen times in the Psalms and was the self-given term of some pious Jewish circles (e.g. Psalm 69:33 ("For the LORD heareth the poor") and 1 QpHab XII, 3.6.10). [13]
The term "Ebionim" was also a self description given by the people who were living in Qumran, as shown in the Dead Sea Scrolls.



Qumran tefillin cases; Leather, First century B.C.E.-first century C.E.
The laws governing the wearing of these were derived from four Biblical passages (Deut. vi. 8, xi. 18; Ex. xiii. 9, 16). Each box contains the four Scriptural passages Ex. xiii. 1-10, 11-16; Deut. vi. 4-9, xi. 13-21.
How The Poor are portrayed in the following textual tradition, including texts of the New Testament, Church histories, various anti-heresy polemics and in traditional, modern scholarship, reveals the character of the history provided by the combination of Church, academia and State:
The term "the poor" was at first a common designation for all Christians - a reference to their material
and voluntary poverty.[11][14][15]
The enemy of The Poor takes the title for itself; this is the stuff of parody and black propaganda. An early start to this fraudulent process is:
Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine
1. The evil demon, however, being unable to tear certain others from their allegiance to the Christ of God, yet found them susceptible in a different direction, and so brought them over to his own purposes. The ancients quite properly called these men Ebionites, because they held poor and mean opinions concerning Christ.
2. For they considered him a plain and common man, who was justified only because of his superior virtue, and who was the fruit of the intercourse of a man with Mary. In their opinion the observance of the ceremonial law was altogether necessary, on the ground that they could not be saved by faith in Christ alone and by a corresponding life.
3. There were others, however, besides them, that were of the same name, but avoided the strange and absurd beliefs of the former, and did not deny that the Lord was born of a virgin and of the Holy Spirit. But nevertheless, inasmuch as they also refused to acknowledge that he pre-existed, being God, Word, and Wisdom, they turned aside into the impiety of the former, especially when they, like them, endeavored to observe strictly the bodily worship of the law.
4. These men, moreover, thought that it was necessary to reject all the epistles of the apostle, whom they called an apostate from the law; and they used only the so-called Gospel according to the Hebrews and made small account of the rest.
5. The Sabbath and the rest of the discipline of the Jews they observed just like them, but at the same time, like us, they celebrated the Lord’s days as a memorial of the resurrection of the Saviour.
6. Wherefore, in consequence of such a course they received the name of Ebionites, which signified the poverty of their understanding. For this is the name by which a poor man is called among the Hebrews.
The purported author is one Eusebius of Caesarea, a fiction; the earliest texts claiming - with no support - to be copied from his works, belong to the 6th century, two centuries late. They become the basis for much of the false history taught today. This fiction becomes the glittering web of false assumptions which sets the agenda for scholarly debate and mires most scholars, even skeptics.
Even the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906) accepts most of this self-contradicting nonsense:
Sect of Judæo-Christians of the second to the fourth century. They believed in the Messianic character of Jesus, but denied his divinity and supernatural origin; observed all the Jewish rites, such as circumcision and the seventh-day Sabbath; and used a gospel according to Matthew written in Hebrew or Aramaic, while rejecting the writings of Paul as those of an apostate (Irenæus, "Adversus Hæreses," i. 262; Origen, "Contra Celsum," ii. 1; Eusebius, "Hist. Eccl." iii. 27; Hippolytus, "Refutatio Hæresium," vii. 34; Jerome, Commentary on Isaiah, i. 3, 12; on Matt. xii. 13). Some Ebionites, however, accepted the doctrine of the supernatural birth of Jesus, and worked out a Christology of their own (Origen, l.c. v. 61).



The origin of the Ebionites was, perhaps intentionally, involved at an early date in legend. Origen ("De Principiis," iv. 1, 22; "Contra Celsum," ii. 1) still knew that the meaning of the name "Ebionim" was "poor," but refers it to the poverty of their understanding (comp. Eusebius, l.c.), because they refused to accept the Christology of the ruling Church. Later a mythical person by the name of Ebion was invented as the founder of the sect, who, like Cerinth, his supposed teacher, lived among the Nazarenes in Kokabe, a village in the district of Basan on the eastern side of the Jordan, and, having spread his heresy among the Christians who fled to this part of Palestine after the destruction of the Temple, migrated to Asia and to Rome (Epiphanius, "Hæreses," xxx. 1, 2; Hippolytus, l.c. vii. 35, x. 22; Tertullian, "De Præscriptione Hæreticorum," 33). The early Christians called themselves preferably "Ebionim" (the poor; comp. Epiphanius, l.c. xxx. 17; Minucius Felix Octavius, ch. 36), because they regarded self-imposed poverty as a meritorious method of preparation for the Messianic kingdom, according to Luke vi. 20, 24: "Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God"; and "Woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation" (=Messianic share; Matt. v. 3, "the poor in spirit," is a late modification of the original; comp. Luke iv. 18, vii. 22; Matt. xix. 21 et seq., xxvi. 9 et seq.; Luke xix. 8; John xii. 5; Rom. xv. 26; II Cor. vi. 10, viii. 9; Gal. ii. 10; James ii. 5 et seq.). Accordingly they dispossessed themselves of all their goods and lived in communistic societies (Acts iv. 34 et seq.). In this practise the Essenes also were encouraged, partly by Messianic passages, such as Isa. xi. 4, xlix. 3 (comp. Ex. R. xxxi.), partly by Deut. xv. 11: "The poor shall never cease out of the land"—a passage taken to be a warning not to embark upon commerce when the study of the Law is thereby neglected (Ta'an. 21a; comp. also Mek., Beshallaḥ, ii., ed. Weiss, 56; see notes).
Origen (l.c. ii. 1), while not clear as to the precise meaning of the term "Ebionim," gives the more important testimony that all Judæo-Christians were called "Ebionites." The Christians that fled to the trans-Jordanic land (Eusebius, "Hist. Eccl." iii. 5, 3), remaining true to their Judean traditions, were afterward regarded as a heretic sect of the Ebionites, and hence rose the legend of Ebion. To them belonged Symmachus, the Bible translator (ib. vi. 17).

Harnack, History of Dogma, pp. 299-300, Boston, 1895; Hilgenfeld, Ketzergeschichte, 1884, pp. 421-446, where the legendary Ebion is treated as a historical person.
The references (highlighted supra) thus become a valuable list of false sources.
Avigad (1971: 193, 198) contends that ‘Yehonathan the Nazirite’ was the head of a prominent and aristocratic family, probably buried in the plain sarcophagus, while his wife was apparently interred in the ornamented sarcophagus. In its architectural and artistic standards it is akin to the royal tombs of Queen Helen of Adiabene and Herod’s family.
The Jews of Qumran were known by many titles other than The Poor and Essenes; one was Nazirite:
In the Hebrew Bible, a Nazirite or Nazarite, (in Hebrew: נזיר , nazir), refers to one who voluntarily took a vow described in Numbers 6:1–21. The proper noun "Nazarite" comes from
the Hebrew word nazir meaning "consecrated" or "separated".
[1]
This vow required the man or woman to:
Abstain from wine, wine vinegar, grapes, raisins, intoxicating liquors,
[2]
vinegar distilled from such
substances,
[3]
and eating or drinking any substance that contains any trace of grapes.
[4]
Refrain from cutting the hair on one's head; but to allow the locks of the head's hair to grow.
[5]
Not to become impure by corpses or graves, even those of family members.
[6]
After following these requirements for a designated period of time (which would be specified in the individual's vow), the person would immerse in amikveh and make three offerings: a lamb as a burnt offering (olah), a ewe as a sin-offering (hatat), and a ram as a peace offering (shelamim), in addition to a basket of unleavened bread, grain offerings and drink offerings, which accompanied the peace offering. They would also shave their head in the outer courtyard of the Temple (the Jerusalem Temple for Judaism) and then place the hair on the same fire as the peace offering. (Numbers 6:18)
This term was parodied with:
Epiphanius, and other writers such as Jerome, distinguished the 4th Century Nazarenes from the earlier use of "Sect of the Nazarenes" (ἡ τῶν Ναζωραίων αἵρεσις) applied to the New Testament Church in Acts



24:5, where Paul the Apostle is accused before Felix at Caesarea (the capital of Roman Judaea)
by Tertullus of being "a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes."[4]
This provides further, useful additions to false sources. A more famous parody of the term is, of course, Nazareth, for which archaeology has demonstrated no village or town of that name in the 1st century.
On these terms, we finish with an extract from an early paper by Eisenman, republished in 2013:
Through this analysis, also, sense can be made of the testimony, referred to above, of James actually functioning as high priest. Whether the Maccabean priesthood "of the Most High God” is, also, to be identified with the Melchizedek one of Christianity and the Letter to the Hebrews remains open to question. Whether this latter usage of the term can be extended to the Qumran (or Zadokite) use of the term as well has been debated. The writer would take a position in the affirmative, considering all such juxtapositions of the letters Z-D-K to be interrelated, in this regard, it should be remembered that the formula, “men of the lot of Melchizedek”, of 11QMelchizedek corresponds almost precisely to the terminology “sons of Zadok" in the Zadokite Document; and therefore, by simple reduction, Zadok and Melchizedek are equivalent usages.
Finally, if there is substance to any of these extensions and identifications, “the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek” must be related to what we have called “the Zealot”, based on “the zeal of Phineas" and invoked on behalf of Simeon the Righteous, Mattathias, and Onias in the Hebrew version of Ecclesiasticus, 1 Macc, and 2 Macc respectively." Correspondingly, J. Bowman has argued in a much overlooked article on this subject that the Zadokite one bases its claims for legitimacy on this selfsame “covenant of Phineas”. By now it should be clear that these are not all separate reckonings, but rather esoteric or poetic variations around the same theme, “Righteousness” and/or “zeal"; just as the various phraseologies the community at Qumran used to refer to itself e.g., “sons of Light”, “sons of Truth", "sons of Zadok”, "sons of Zedek” , “the sons of Hesed” , “Ebionim", “the Elect of Righteousness”, “the Meek", "Ebionei-Hesed" (“the Poor Ones of Piety“), "Nimharei-Zedek” (“the Zealous for Righteousness”), “Tamimei-Derech” (“the Perfect of the Way”), "Anshei-Tamim ha-Kodesh” (“the Men of the Perfection of Holiness”), etc., do not all designate different groups , but function as interchangeable metaphors. In this view, the Covenant of Phineas operated over and above the general Aaronite one (Bowman considered the Covenant of Phineas to be the prior one), setting forth which among the various Aaronite heirs could be considered suitable candidates for the high priesthood, i.e., the “zealous” or “righteous” ones. it is significant that one of the original demands at the time of the first uprising in 4 BCE, inspired according to Josephus by “the Zealots”, was to appoint “according to the law” a high priest of “more perfect purity”. For their part it was the “messianically”-inspired zealous young priests who by stopping sacrifice on behalf of the Romans gave the signal for the start of the uprising in 66 CE. Commentators who cannot make a determination as to whether the Dead Sea Scroll sect was anti-Herodian or pro-Herodian, pro-Hyrcanus or pro-Aristobulus, and consequently are unable, for instance, to make any sense out of the destruction of the community in the forties or thirties BCE by fire, are equally unable to understand any of the considerations delineated above; or rather simply do not wish to, preferring to take a position on the relatively safer and less controversial questions of palaeography and archaeology.

The Way - Origins of Christianity
11-14 minutes
In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord (Isaiah 40:3)
Having seen how The Poor - of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls - have been parodied by the textual tradition, including and especially in the New Testament (the original of which is pre-Christian), another term used by these Observant Jews to describe their approach of their faith is The Way and that, too and of course, has also been parodied.
The parody bis not obvious to all:
In the Scrolls, the sectarians of the ‘New Testament’ usually refer to themselves as ‘The Way’, ‘The Poor’, and the ‘Church of God’.
The first of these terms, the ‘Way’ is exactly as that used in Acts in a half dozen examples, the first of which is at 9:2. Within the NT, only in Acts do we see this sobriquet used for what we are invited to believe are
early Jewish Christians. The Scrolls use the term in an unqualified or absolute sense, exactly as in Acts. [7].
[7] For example, 'Those who have chosen the Way...' 1QS 9:17-18. See Fitzmyer, 1997, p. 282 for other examples of the absolute use of 'Way'.
Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. (Acts of the Apostles 9:1-2)
This character Saul is still, at this point, presented as the Herodian thug persecuting insurrectionists (the followers of James at Qumran):
Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews - Book XX, Chapter 9. Concerning Albinus under whose Procuratorship James was slain; as also what edifices were built by Agrippa.
Costobarus also, and Saulus, did themselves get together a multitude of wicked wretches, and this because they were of the royal family; and so they obtained favor among them, because of their kindred to Agrippa; but still they used violence with the people, and were very ready to plunder those that were weaker than themselves. And from that time it principally came to pass that our city was greatly disordered, and that all things grew worse and worse among us.
Josephus, The Wars Of The Jews, Or The History Of The Destruction Of Jerusalem, Book II, Chapter 17. How the war of the Jews with the Romans began, and concerning Manahem.
So the men of power perceiving that the sedition was too hard for them to subdue, and that the danger which would arise from the Romans would come upon them first of all, endeavored to save themselves, and sent ambassadors, some to Florus, the chief of which was Simon the son of Ananias; and others to Agrippa, among whom the most eminent were Saul, and Antipas, and Costobarus, who were of the king's kindred; and they desired of them both that they would come with an army to the city, and cut off the seditious before it should be too hard to be subdued.
Josephus, The Wars Of The Jews, Or The History Of The Destruction Of Jerusalem, Book II, Chapter 20. Cestius sends ambassadors to Nero. The people of Damascus slay those Jews that lived with them. The people of Jersualem after they had [left off] persuing Cestius, return to the city and get things ready for its defence and make a great many generals for, their armies and particularly Josephus the writer of these books. Some of account of his administration.
1. AFTER this calamity had befallen Cestius, many of the most eminent of the Jews swam away from the city, as from a ship when it was going to sink; Costobarus, therefore, and Saul, who were brethren, together with Philip, the son of Jacimus, who was the commander of king Agrippa's forces, ran away from the city, and went to Cestius. But then how Antipas, who had been besieged with them in the king's palace, but would not fly away with them, was afterward slain by the seditious, we shall relate hereafter. However, Cestius sent Saul and his friends, at their own desire, to Achaia, to Nero, to inform him of the great distress they were in, and to lay the blame of their kindling the war upon Florus, as hoping to alleviate his own danger, by provoking his indignation against Florus.



As the Saul of the New Testament is this same Saul, there is little or no need for parody: he really is the bully-boy working for the Herodians as he is portrayed. When he becomes Paul, his role becomes covert, pretending to have converted to The Way and whilst roaming the Levant supposedly gathering support for the insurrectionists, actually recruiting his own Greco-Roman/Chrestian following.
Though the words "the way" appears many times in the New Testament, some of these seem to refer more obviously to the Jewish religious expression:
This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' " (Matthew 3:3 NIV) For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. (Matthew 21:32 NIV) They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are. (Matthew 22:16 NIV) They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? (Mark 12:14 NIV) And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, (Luke 1:76 NIV) As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. (Luke 3:4 NIV) So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. (Luke 20:21 NIV) John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.' " (John 1:23 NIV) Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14:6 NIV) This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved." (Acts 16:17 NIV) He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. (Acts 18:25 NIV) He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. (Acts 18:26 NIV) But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. (Acts 19:9 NIV) About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. (Acts 19:23 NIV) However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, (Acts 24:14 NIV) Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case." (Acts 24:22 NIV)
Felix the procurator of Judea is a freedman of Antonia Minor and thus a Chrestian, supporter of the Herodian monarchy and its agent, Saul.
Priscilla and Aquila we may treat later.



We see clearly how The Way can be used in parody, with this example:
For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. (Matthew 21:32 NIV)
This is not the message of Observant Jews, especially not of the Messianic Jews and Righteous Teacher of Qmran and the Scrolls. Rather this is the imperial, Roman message, typical of Chrestianity. As Gould describes:
A second story from Acts that is paralleled by another source is Simon Peter’s famous “tablecloth vision” from Chapter 10 [It will be recalled that “Peter” (i.e., “Rocky”) is a nickname that Simon has acquired, presumably because his support of Jesus was “solid as a rock”.] Peter is going to be invited to dinner by a centurion, Cornelius from the Italica regiment in Caesarea, who is improbably described as “fearing God”, “giving many gifts to the poor”, and “supplicating God continuously” (Acts 10:1-2). Peter has a vision in which a heavenly tablecloth descends, covered with various animals, which he is instructed by a voice to “kill and eat. ‘Surely not, Lord!’ Peter replied. ‘I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.’ The voice spoke to him a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’ ” (Acts 10:13-15). Later, Peter summarizes his visit: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.” (Acts 10:28).
Even without knowing the historical parallel of this story, it is one of the most revealing and explosive in the entire New Testament. First, it demonstrates unequivocally that the whole “inclusivist message”, which is directly attributed to Jesus via innumerable Gospel stories, was in fact completely foreign to Jesus. Otherwise, it would not have been necessary for Peter, one of his closest and “rockiest” supporters, to receive a vision about it well after Jesus’s death. Thus, this story, by itself, tells us that vast portions of the Gospels, in which Jesus is pictured as associating and engaging in table fellowship with all kinds of forbidden persons (tax collectors, prostitutes, etc) and dismissing Jewish dietary law in favor of a universalist, humanitarian message (“What goes into a man’s mouth does not make him unclean but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him unclean.” Matt 15:10), are just constructed from whole cloth. In fact, it is astonishing that anyone can remain a believing Christian after pondering this clumsy addendum to the Jesus Gospel stories.
Also:
By "Herodian" we mean a religio-political orientation not inimical to the aims of the Herodian family, not only in Palestine, but also in Asia Minor and even Rome, and possibly implying a genealogical connection as well. Examples of the effect of such an orientation expressed with retrospective historical effect in the Gospels would be the curious thematic repetitions portraying a Jewish Messiah desiring fellowship with "Sinners" (for Paul in Gal 2:l, "Gentiles"), "publicans" (presumably Jewish dietary regulations were of little consequence to such persons), "prostitutes" (in our view a euphemism for "fornicators" as per Jamesian/Qumran definition, i.e., those who defined technical rules of sexual purity differently or less strictly), and "tax-collectors" (persons fitting comfortably into the political philosophy enunciated by Paul in Rom 13), and a whole genre of other allusions such as "the first shall be last," "these little ones"/"simple ones," the Messiah as "wine-bibber" (presumably therefore distinguished from such well-known life-long Nazirite types as his brother James, John the Baptist, the mysterious "Banus," and probably the Qumran Righteous Teacher). (Price review)
As we indicate, this James is the "messiah" - until his extra-judicial killing in 62 - and hence the biblical parody:
7 And God considered their works; for they sought Him with a perfect heart
And He raised them up a Teacher of righteousness
To lead them in the way of His heart.
8 And He made known to later generations
what He had done [to a later generation] to a congregation of treacherous men:
Those who turned aside out of the way. (The Damascus Document)

James as ΙΥ, IC, ΙΣ - Origins of Christianity
30-39 minutes
Jesus does not appear in any early sacred text claimed by Christianity - this is an undisputed fact. These texts use abbreviations and they spell IS/JS; no explanation was provided in that period, leaving us to speculate on the name.
Contents

When we look at Judea in the first half of the 1st century, we see many people named Jesus, though not a single one fitting anything like the description of the divine man of the textual tradition. Neither Jesus Chrest, nor Jesus Christ exist in the historical record.
His death
The various religious traditions described this divine man as the undisputed leader of a religious community in Judea. The historical record contains one such group and it is not Christian; it was called by outsiders Essenes, based in Qumran, buried the Dead Sea Scrolls and its leader was James, until he died by an extra-judicial killing in 62.
There is a record of this killing:
It is impossible that this passage is entirely genuine. It is highly unlikely that Josephus, a believing Jew working under Romans, would have written, "He was the Messiah." This would make him suspect of treason, but nowhere else is there an indication that he was a Christian. Indeed, in Wars of the Jews, Josephus declares that Vespasian fulfilled the messianic oracles. Furthermore, Origen, writing about a century before Eusebius, says twice that Josephus "did not believe in Jesus as the Christ."
Here is the text, with the interpolation greyed out:
CONCERNING ALBINUS UNDER WHOSE PROCURATORSHIP JAMES WAS SLAIN; AS ALSO WHAT EDIFICES WERE BUILT BY AGRIPPA.
1. AND now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity [to exercise his authority]. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought
before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high



priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.
The cast:
Josephus in The Jewish War considered Ananus "unique in his love for liberty and an enthusiast for democracy" and as an "effective speaker, whose words carried weight with the people".
After ben Hanan was deposed as high priest, he continued to exercise leadership. "Under the guidance of former high priest Ananus ben Ananus, they (the Sanhedrin) exhorted the populace for support against the radical priestly Zealots, as these 'persuaded those who officiated in the Temple sacrifices to accept no gift or services from a foreigner' (BJ II, 409-414)." Later, he marshaled recruits to fight the Zealots, resulting in the Zealot Temple Siege. While commanding the Jews during the siege, Ananus was killed by the Edomites when they were let into Jerusalem by the Zealots.
Herod Agrippa II (born AD 27/28), officially named Marcus Julius Agrippa and sometimes just called Agrippa, was the seventh and last king of the family of Herod the Great, the Herodians. He was the son of the first and better-known Herod Agrippa, the brother of Berenice, Mariamne, and Drusilla (second wife of the Roman procurator Antonius Felix).
Note: this Felix was a freedman of Antonia Minor, leading Chrestian.
A contemporaneous record exists within the Dead Sea Scrolls; sources within the Christian textual tradition should be dismissed, Hegesippus for example is just a corruption of Josephus:
If one looks at the ambiance of the Is 3:10 passage applied to James' death by these early Church sources, one encounters from about Is I-5 a general tenor of salvation through Righteousness and allusion to the imminent destruction of Jerusalem. The text directly appeals to the "Beit-Ya'acov”, James’ Hebrew name repeated three times (which would doubtlessly have appealed to the practitioners of this kind of exegesis) and amid an atmosphere of oncoming armies and imminent destruction precisely analogous to the Habakkuk Pesher intones:
“Jerusalem is ruined; Judea is fallen...the Lord is taking away from Jerusalem support of every kind". These last should be compared with the insistence in early Church sources that James’ death was in some way connected to the fall of Jerusalem and Paul's description of the central triad of the early Church of “James, Cephas, and John” as “these Pillars". The last in our view incorporates a direct allusion to James’ Zaddiknature, which by extension can be seen as a “Zadokite” play (as per the general thrust of Qumran esoteric exegesis and wordplay) on the sense of Proverbs' "the Zaddik the Foundation of the World”.
The rise of such a style of exegesis explains why the early "Church" felt that the destruction of Jerusalem was inevitable once its “Protection”, "Bulwark”, or “Pillar” (all allusions having counterparts in the usage of IQH and IQS) was removed.
The Zaddik-the-Pillar-of-the-World metaphor is also at the root of the allusion to James the Righteous One in the Gospel of Thomas and related materials concerning the disappearance of “Heaven and Earth" in the New Testament “Little Apocalypses”. It is the basic thrust behind whatever may be meant by the Oblias sobriquet which also attached itself to James’ person. Though the precise derivation of the latter is unclear, Eusebius/Hegesippus make it clear that it related to James’ “support”/“Protection” activities among the mass of Jewish "Poor" (Ebionim /'Aniyyim - “the Rabbim” of Qumran/Is 53:11 allusion). With all of this data at our disposal, it would not be difficult to imagine the content of a Qumran-style peskier on the first four or five chapters of Isaiah (including an important oracle which has relevance for controversies regarding the Pella-flight tradition: “to flee into the Rocks and the caves“), so exactly parallel in tone and content to the first few chapters of Habakkuk we will analyze. (James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher)
What we may know of James
Historically Ya'aqub/James has been referred to as the Tzadik (Hebrew: צדיק "righteous one") and could be considered a miracle-worker.
The Essene character of James "the Little," or "the Just," seems to rest on authentic tradition. According to Epiphanius ("Hæres." lxxviii. 14), he wore a golden plate on his forehead (comp. Meg. iv. 8, where this is characterized as "the way of the Gnostics" ["derek minut" or "ḥizonim"]), and no sandals. Another evidence of his Essene piety manifests itself in the following: "When, during a drought, he stretched forth his hands in prayer, rain immediately came" (comp. Ta'an. 23a et seq.).
It is possible that the last words ascribed to Jesus were original with James the Just. (James, Jewish Encyclopedia)
And Eisenman:
Eisenman first draws a portrait of the early community of James as a nationalistic, messianic, priestly, and xenophobic sect of ultra-legal pietism, something most of us would deem fanaticism. (Robert Eiseman's JAMES THE BROTHER OF JESUS: A Higher-Critical Evaluation, Robert M. Price, Drew University)
These "Internal" data markers include, for instance: 1) several references to "the Community of the Poor" (that is, "the Ebionim" - popularly expressed as "the Ebionites", the same name as the Community James is supposed to have led in all Early Church literature); 2) that "the Wicked Priest", exactly as in the Habakkuk Pesher, sought to "put to death the Righteous Teacher", for which act - again as in the Habakkuk Pesher God would "pay him His reward by delivering him into the hands of the Violent Ones of the Gentiles (i.e., "the 'Arizei ha-Go'im") to execute Judgement upon him" - in the Habakkuk Pesher, it is "upon the body of his flesh" (thus the late G. Vermes, but really "the flesh of his body" - for footnotes on matters such as



these, see the total expanse of my work from 1977 to the present, including Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians, and Qumran and James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher, E. J. Brill, 1984-86, The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians,1996, and The New Testament Code, 2006 above).
This last, of course, is exactly what happens to James' destroyer, the High Priest Ananus ben Ananus, if one reads one's Josephus carefully, when the "Idumaeans" (i. e., the true "Violent Ones of the Gentiles", but in this instance allied to the revolutionary "Zealots" and "Sicarii") rampage through the City killing all the High Priests they come upon (who were viewed as "collaborators"); but, in particular, Ananus ben Ananus, mocking his dead body - perhaps even urinating upon it to render it impure - before throwing it outside the walls of the city without burial naked, as food for jackals and wolves. One might ask , why - why such abnormal hostility? You, dear reader, tell me. This is a good example of what can develop out of "the Internal Data" when used in a properly intelligent manner. (James the Just as Righteous Teacher -- The Radiocarbon Controversy, Robert Eisenman 10/22/2013)
James is JS
Since the public began to see translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Teacher of Righteousness appeared, many saw the obvious parallel, that here was the historical record of the gospel's divine man, known commonly (though erroneously) as Jesus. This view best fits the reliable evidence and thus is most likely correct.
The JS of the early sacred texts (later claimed and remade as Christian) is probably James.
There is no comparable figure to James in that period; for earlier, there is John the Baptiser; these two are in a line of such office holders:
James was a rainmaker like Elijah, Honi the Circle-maker, and Hanan the Wise. Nathanael is another mask for James. Jesus finds him, conspicuously, sitting beneath a fig tree, the posture of rain-makers, as they waited (in a gesture of anticipative, imitative magic) for their prayers to be answered. (Robert Eisenman, The New Testament Code: The Cup of the Lord, the Damascus Covenant, and the Blood of Christ, reviewed by Robert M. Price)
For Habakkuk as rain-maker, see the whole narrative relating to Honi and his descendants in b. Ta‘an 23aff. That James, too, functioned as a rain-maker is confirmed by Epiphanius in Haeres. 78.14 (the notice is too original to be simply dismissed as spurious). As such, he is a contemporary of and exhibits suspiciously similar characteristics to another “rain-making” grandson of Honi, Abba Hilkiah. Rabbinic literature unerringly designates Phineas as a rain-maker, anticipating Elijah in this activity, his successor in the redivivus tradition, and depicts similar activities on the part of Hanan ha-Nebba, another grandson of Honi, who is often identified with John the Baptist. (James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher by Robert Eisenman)
John/Hanan was not baptising, he and his followers used mikveh for cleansing, as we see both in the archaeology of Qumran (image right) and in Jewish practice.

John and James were leaders of the same community at Qumran - probably the world's first monastery - killed successively by the Herodian monarchy.
Parody
Black propaganda is false information and material that purports to be from a source on one side of a conflict, but is actually from the opposing side. It is typically used to vilify, embarrass or misrepresent the enemy.
The gospels are not history, but parody, using as their subjects the enemies of the Chrestians: Messianic Judaism, the community at Qumran (the Poor), its leadership and associated groups such as Zealots/Sicarii. Modern scholarship as exemplified by Eisenman and Price, show in detail how this worked.
Herod Agrippa, also known as Herod or Agrippa I (10 BC – 44 AD), was a Judean monarchduring the 1st century AD. The grandson of Herod the Great and son of Aristobulus IV and Berenice. He was born Marcus Julius Agrippa, so named in honour of Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. He is the king named Herod in the Acts of the Apostles, in the Bible, "Herod (Agrippa)" (Ἡρώδης Ἀγρίππας). He was, according to Josephus, known in his time as "Agrippa the Great". Christian and Jewish historiography take different views of this king, with the Christians largely opposing Agrippa and the Jews largely favoring Agrippa.
Why the parody is a natural question and perhaps the facts will help provide an answer. The time frame in the parody is moved from Herod Agrippa II to that of Herod Agrippa and this perhaps, is most significant, for the king in the parody is hated in the sacred texts:



On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died. (Acts 12)
He was hated because the Chrestians regarded him as a traitor: raised as one of the child hostages (so he would be Romanised, probably as a Chrestian). Yet he supported the Jewish cause, so that if he were to have been assassinated, as Chrestians killed other leaders (such as the emperors Nero and Domitian), then this would not surprise.
With the time shifted back, then the Roman responsible for the death also had to change, from Albinus to Pilate.
This time-shift also alters the date for the extra-judicial killing of John, the previous Qumran leader, appearing to shift the responsibility to Herod Agrippa as well.
The major characteristic of black propaganda is that the people are not aware that someone is trying to influence them, and do not feel that they are being pushed in a certain direction. Black propaganda purports to emanate from a source other than the true source. This type of propaganda is associated with covert psychological operations. Sometimes the source is concealed or credited to a false authority and spreads lies, fabrications, and deceptions. Black propaganda is the "big lie", including all types of creative deceit. Black propaganda relies on the willingness of the receiver to accept the credibility of the source.
Terrible war broke out four years after James was killed and was followed by two others, the final war being nothing less than a holocaust, destroying Messianic Judaism and with Palestine replacing Judea. The stories which were composed, changed and changed again to become the final New Testament result from this bitter struggle over the first and second centuries.
Eisenman provides numerous examples of parody in the New Testament, including these:
...our portrait of Jesus in the Greek gospels seems largely to be an amalgam of Pauline anti-halakha and episodes borrowed from various messianic and prophetic figures in Josephus. Indeed, I have for some time thought the same thing. Does not the warning of the Synoptic Apocalypse not to confuse Jesus with other prophets and messiahs during the siege of Jerusalem imply that just such amalgamations and confusions were going on? Do not Apocalypses always forewarn their readers against doing what the author knows they are in fact doing.
In the Triumphal Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem to "cleanse" the Temple which had become a "robber's den," can we not recognize the entry of messiah Simon bar-Giora into the city at the invitation of the priesthood to "cleanse" the Temple of rival freedom fighters? And (as Eisenman and John Dominic Crossan both note) is not the mute flogging of Jesus by priests and Roman Procurator for predicting the Temple's doom suspiciously similar to that of Jesus ben-Ananias? Jesus' mockery as a king during a visit of a Herodian "king" sounds remarkably like the Carabas incident reported by Philo in Against Flaccus (again, Crossan notes this), which also echoes Barabbas, as if it needed pointing out. The attempt by the crowd to force Pilate into condemning Jesus by threatening to report his delinquency to Caesar recalls the actual complaint against Pilate made by Samaritans after he butchered the partisans of the Samaritan Taheb on Mount Gerizim, a deed which actually did result in Pilate's recall to Rome. Jesus' execution as King of the Jews reminds us of Simon bar-Giora's in Rome.
The spear thrust to confirm his death recalls that following the suicide pact of the fugitive Spartan revolutionary king Cleomenes and his cohorts in Plutarch's Lives. Similarly, the portents at Jesus' crucifixion are strikingly like those at Cleomenes' crucifixion which led the women bystanders to acclaim the slain rebel king a son of the gods and to visit the site thereafter to worship. And as Eisenman shows, even Jesus' reappearance after three days to his mourning disciples matches that of the rebel hero Niger in the Roman War, who was assumed dead by friend and foe alike, but was really hiding in a cave for three days while his lamenting followers searched for his body, only to be "surprised by joy" when he emerged from his cave alive!



Though parody was popular in Greek literature (παρῳδία parodia), it reached new heights in 1st and 2nd century Rome with Juvenal and his Satires.
James/Stephen in Acts of the Apostles
Even for the fabricators of the New Testament, making James out to be somebody else is unoriginal.
First the biblical account:
8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. 9 Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen. 10 But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking. 11 Then they secretly instigated men who said, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” 12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, 13 and they set up false witnesses who said, “This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law, 14 for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.” 15 And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
This special, divine person is James; the person organising the attack is Saul:
Costobarus also, and Saulus, did themselves get together a multitude of wicked wretches, and this because they were of the royal family; and so they obtained favor among them, because of their kindred to Agrippa; but still they used violence with the people, and were very ready to plunder those that were weaker than themselves. And from that time it principally came to pass that our city was greatly disordered, and that all things grew worse and worse among us. (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews - Book XX, Chapter 9. Concerning Albinus under whose Procuratorship James was slain; as also what edifices were built by Agrippa.)



A good analysis:
Paul’s Attempted Murder of James/”Stephen”
The first is the story of Stephen, the first Christian martyr, told in Acts of the Apostles. I should mention at the outset that Acts is composed of two radically different sections. The first half is similar to the Gospels in that it is a phantasmagoric, fictionalized narrative constructed by imaginative reworking of a broad melange of historical and literary materials. The second half, beginning in the middle of Chapter 16, is a more-or-less straightforward first-person-plural narrative of events actually experienced by its author (the so-called “We Document”.)
The Stephen story is in Chapters 6–7 and so is part of the phantasmagoric section. It classically recounts how Stephen is assaulted and killed by a gang of political thugs as he is debating various theological points from the Temple steps. The organizer of this gang is identified as “Saul” (“Saulos” in the original Greek, a point to which I will return), who later in Acts transforms into “Paul” after his famous vision on the “road to Damascus”. As first pointed out by Stephen H.-J. Schoeps, another document from this period, the Pseudoclementine Recognitions covers much of the same material as Acts (probably working from the same underlying source), but in place of the “Stephen” story, tells another tale, which is much more plausible. According to the Recognitions, it is James who is debating points from the Temple steps and who is attacked by political thugs. The leader of the gang is not identified in the text by name: he is simply referred to as the “enemy”. However, in the margins of some extant copies, this “enemy” is identified as “Paul”. James is not killed but suffers a broken leg and is carried off by his supporters to a location “near Jericho” (which plausibly could be Qumrum, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found – more below). His leg is said to be still healing a month later when he sends Simon Peter out on a mission, a level of detail not likely to be invented. (Essay by Dr. Andrew P. Gould, Ohio State U. Distinguished Professor of Mathematical and Physical Sciences)
Then who is IC/JS?
Isn't it a bit odd, with James as James and James as the divine man IC (most now call Jesus)? Yes, of course and the New Testament accounts are full of such name games:
...Eisenman has developed a keen sense for the "name game" played in the sources. Most of us have sometime scratched our heads over the tantalizing confusions latent in the strange redundancy of similar names in the New Testament accounts. How can Mary have had a sister named Mary? Is there a difference between Joseph Barsabbas Justus, Judas Barsabbas Justus, Jesus Justus, Titius Justus, and James the Just? Whence all the Jameses and Judases? Who are Simon the Zealot and Judas the Zealot (who appears in some NT manuscripts and other early Christian documents)? Is Clopas the same as Cleophas? What's going on with Jesus ben-Ananias, Jesus Barabbas, Elymas bar-Jesus, and Jesus Justus? What does Boanerges really mean? Is Nathaniel a nickname for someone else we know of? And so on, and so on. Most of us puzzle over these oddities for a moment—and then move on. After all, how important can they be, anyway? (Robert Price review)
Jesus is a medieval additive, placed into the textual tradition. The role played by the nomina sacrum, IC etc, is a different matter, for this produces two James, one a named parody of the real, historical personage named James, and the other is his divine self, the Righteous Teacher in his full glory as a divine man. We see the same method with Saul the Herodian thug pursuing Messianic Jews, and Paul the divine man: God did extraordinary miracles through Paul (Acts 19:11).
There are numerous, important people named Jesus in this period, though none play the role of a divine man. Ultimately, there is just James.
Choice of nomina sacrum
That there is no contemporaneous explanation for the nomina sacra (and certainly these abbreviations are meant as sacred) and the fact that we today are far removed from both the time and culture of authors using them, ensure that our interpretations are speculative. No matter with how much certainty Christianity (and Christian scholarship) stakes its claim to them and its interpretations, it is guesswork. The best we can do to claim some legitimacy is to ensure that our speculations are informed.
Nomina sacra of the early-modern era - as used in the sacred texts later described as Gnostic (including Manichaean) and Christian - are based on the Greek language. But the practise comes from the Jewish scribal tradition:
While there is no way to be certain of the origin of this practice, most scholars believe that it sprang from the Jewish traditions connected to the writing and reading of the name of the LORD. In Hebrew, this name is spelled with four letters (HWHY, YHWH, pronounced as Yahweh). These four consonant are sometimes called “The Tetragrammaton.”
Because of the great respect that was to be given to the name of the LORD (Exodus 20:7; Leviticus 24:16 LXX), Jewish scribes were extremely careful in how they handled the Tetragrammaton. For instance, while the Hebrew alphabet changed over time (like all alphabets), Jewish scribes continued to write the Tetragrammaton with the ancient style of lettering.
Greek Magic in the early-modern era also used Jewish sacred names; Jao (for Yahweh), Sabaoth, and Adonai appear quite frequently for example. There are also quasi-Jewish cults across the Levant in this period. This desire for people of this time and place to claim some sort of Jewish heritage, or authority, has confused many modern scholars into imagining that they are all (ethnic) Jews.
I have argued here that IC is JS is James and strictly speaking, I think this is correct; however the letters do not have to represent JS - they are also IS, in which case they can also refer to Isaiah:
In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord (Isaiah 40:3)



Photographic reproduction of the Great Isaiah Scroll, the best preserved of the biblical scrolls found at Qumran
The textual tradition associates its messiah very strongly with Isaiah:
Further, this association in the canonical gospels is more with the Righteous Teacher preceding James:
In all four Gospels Isaiah 40:3 is cited with reference to the ministry of John the Baptist, but with a different interpretation. In John's Gospel the citation of Isaiah 40:3 is attributed directly to the Baptist. Whether John was a member of the Qumran community or heavily influenced by them, when the word of the Lord came to him in the Judean wilderness he realized that Isaiah's prophecy did not describe studying the Law in isolation but proclaiming the arrival of God's chosen Messiah. At that point he began to proclaim the message of the Messiah's coming and of imminent judgment. He administered a water baptism of ritual purification and preached repentance. He anticipated that his baptizing ministry would reveal the identity of the Messiah. In John 1:31 the Baptist says, "I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel" (NRSV). This anticipation accords very well with the passage from the Rule of the Community we cited earlier about the man who would be plunged into the spirit and would instruct the upright, seal the covenant, and restore the glory of Adam. (The Dead Sea Scrolls and the New Testament by Mark M. Mattison)
The nomina sacrum IC/IS/JS therefore was originally meant to contain a double meaning: the messiah of Isaiah, the Righteous Teacher of the Dead Sea Scrolls; in the modern era, this was John, then James.
This divine man of the nomina sacra (Lord, Son, Spirit, Saviour, IS) is not unique among miracle workers - Paul is the divine version of Saul and in the same period as they were all made - in the early-3rd century - others also appeared: Thomas, Apollonius of Tyana and Izates/Izas. They are each rooted in the first century; Izates/Izas has his own Annunciation, is born in the year 1, comes from the same literary source - Josephus - as does most of the textual tradition, and fits the nomina sacrum IS perfectly. This is important in understanding IS, because he is purely literary, no matter how divine, no matter whom he is drawn from; he is a literary device, a fiction, made as a point to sink into the messianic heart:
One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.” And IS answering said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he answered, “Say it, Teacher.” (Luke 7:36-40)
The reader who thinks these are the words of anyone but a propagandist hating Messianic Judaism is ignorant of Judea in the first 130 years of the modern era. Such a Teacher could not have existed; he is a parody of the Righteous Teachers.
A congregation of treacherous men
Here is the beginning of the (Cairo) Damascus Document; it states most clearly the division between the Community and its enemy in the first century, those choosing the Greco-Roman way of life and, like Saul, attacked the Righteous:
FRAGMENTS OF A ZADOKITE WORK
also known as The Damascus Document
Translated by R. H Charles
1 1 Now, therefore, hearken (unto me) all ye who know righteousness,
2 And have understanding in the works of God.
For He hath a controversy with all flesh,
And will execute judgment upon all who despise Him.
3 For because of the trespass of those who forsook Him,
He hid His face from Israel and from His Sanctuary,
And gave them over to the sword.



4 But when He remembered the covenant of the forefathers,
He left a remnant to Israel, and gave them not over to destruction.
5 [And in the period of the wrath three hundred and ninety years after He had given them in the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar*, the King of Babylon He visited them],
and He made to spring forth from Israel and Aaron,
A root of His planting to inherit His land,
And to grow fat through the goodness of His earth.
6 And they had understanding of their iniquity,
And they knew that they were guilty men,
And had like the blind been groping after the way twenty years.
7 And God considered their works; for they sought Him with a perfect heart
And He raised them up a Teacher of righteousness
To lead them in the way of His heart.
8 And He made known to later generations
what He had done [to a later generation] to a congregation of treacherous men:
Those who turned aside out of the way.
9 This was the time concerning which it was written:
So hath Israel behaved himself stubbornly:
10 When there arose the scornful man,
Who talked to Israel lying words,
And made them go astray in the wilderness where there was no way,
[to bring low the pride of the world].
11 So that they should turn aside from the paths of righteousness,
And remove the landmark which the forefathers had set in their inheritance:
12 So as to make cleave unto them
The curses of His covenant,
To deliver them to the sword
That avengeth with the vengeance of the covenant.
13 Because they sought after smooth things,
And kept watch with a view to lawless deeds.
14 And they chose the best of the neck,
And justified the wicked,
And condemned the righteous:
15 And transgressed the covenant,
And violated the statute,
And attacked the soul of the righteous.
16 And all that walked uprightly their soul abhorred,
And they pursued them with the sword,
And rejoiced in the strife of the people.
17 And so the wrath of God was kindled against their congregation,
So that He laid waste all their multitude,
And their deeds were uncleanness before Him.
* The Talmudic Chronology (as defined by Rabbi Yossi, disciple of Rabbi Akiva) places this in the Herodian period.



This document was never a secret and neither was its message: the Righteous lost, the Romans won, the lesson noted.

Judas Iscariot - Origins of Christianity
John Bartram, 26 May 2014, 06:35 ⋮ 13-16 minutes
Though there are varied accounts of his death, the traditional version sees him as having hanged himself out of remorse following his betrayal. His place among the Twelve Apostles was later filled by Matthias. He was the first apostle to die, and the only apostle not to achieve sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church. Tradition holds he and John are the only apostles not to die a martyr's death.
He is a parody of the Sicarii, a group described by Josephus:
a. Now as soon as Albinus was come to the city of Jerusalem, he used all his endeavors and care that the country might be kept in peace, and this by destroying many of the Sicarii.
b. But now the Sicarii went into the city by night, just before the festival, which was now at hand, and took the scribe belonging to the governor of the temple, whose name was Eleazar, who was the son of Ananus [Ananias] the high priest, and bound him, and carried him away with them; after which they sent to Ananias, and said that they would send the scribe to him, if he would persuade Albinus to release ten of those prisoners which he had caught of their party; so Ananias was plainly forced to persuade Albinus, and gained his request of him. This was the beginning of greater calamities; for the robbers perpetually contrived to catch some of Ananias's servants; and when they had taken them alive, they would not let them go, till they thereby recovered some of their own Sicarii. And as they were again become no small number, they grew bold, and were a great affliction to the whole country.
(Josephus - Antiquities of the Jews - Book XX CHAPTER 9)
Lucceius Albinus was Roman Procurator of Judea, 62 - 64.
According to Josephus, these Sicarii terrorised the Greco-Romans of Judea, hiding their knives beneath their robes, roaming the streets to attack non-believers:
This Felix took Eleazar the arch-robber, and many that were with him, alive, when they had ravaged the country for twenty years together, and sent them to Rome; but as to the number of the robbers whom he caused to be crucified, and of those who were caught among them, and whom he brought to punishment, they were a multitude not to be enumerated.
3. When the country was purged of these, there sprang up another sort of robbers in Jerusalem, which were called Sicarii, who slew men in the day time, and in the midst of the city; this they did chiefly at the festivals, when they mingled themselves among the multitude, and concealed daggers under their garments, with which they stabbed those that were their enemies; and when any fell down dead, the murderers became a part of those that had indignation against them; by which means they appeared persons of such reputation, that they could by no means be discovered. The first man who was slain by them was Jonathan the high priest, after whose death many were slain every day, while the fear men were in of being so served was more afflicting than the calamity itself;and while every body expected death every hour, as men do in war, so men were obliged to look before them, and to take notice of their enemies at a great distance; nor, if their friends were coming to them, durst they trust them any longer; but, in the midst of their suspicions and guarding of themselves, they were slain. Such was the celerity of the plotters against them, and so cunning was their contrivance.
4. There was also another body of wicked men gotten together, not so impure in their actions, but more wicked in their intentions, which laid waste the happy state of the city no less than did these murderers. These were such men as deceived and deluded the people under pretense of Divine inspiration, but were for procuring innovations and changes of the government; and these prevailed with the multitude to act like madmen, and went before them into the wilderness, as pretending that God would there show them the signals of liberty. But Felix thought this procedure was to be the beginning of a revolt; so he sent some horsemen and footmen both armed, who destroyed a great number of them.



Eisenman has suggested (The Sociology of MMT and the Conversions of King Agbarus and Queen) that, based on later testimoney, these Sicarii-Essenes "will kill anyone they hear discussing the Law who is not circumcized" - that is not just any Greek or Roman, but those converted by Saul, which is further evidence for Saul, Josephus, Felix and the court of Herod Agrippa II working in league (i.e. being Chrestian).
We should look at this section of Eisenman's argument in detail because as well as describing how the Sicarii are misrepresented, we see how this parody includes both Helen and Izates in this regard:
Conveniently this "eunuch" is reading Isaiah rather than Gen 17 on Abraham's circumcision. In fact, it is Is 53, "the Suffering Servant," one of the most basic of all early Christian proof texts. But the parody on circumcision from the Izates/Monobazus conversion episode in Josephus and Talmudic literature should be clear -- though this with rather malevolent intent -- circumcision being for the Romans a form of bodily mutilation in the manner of castration ( cf. Origen castrating himself in the manner of a "Sicarios" and the Roman ~ex Cornelia de Sicarius, fairly extensively expounded in James the Brother of Jesus). The Queen's eunuch immediately steps down from his chariot and requests baptism -- an important element in the story in linking it to other "baptist" groups further east, whereupon Philip immediately dematerializes and disappears to another place.
Not only is the conversion episode involving Queen Helen's sons being parodied, but so are her Famine relief operations, she having sent her Treasury agents to buy grain as far as Egypt and Cyprus. Of course, the Book of Acts is showing knowledge of these episodes and transforming them in a consistent, if somewhat tendentious manner. In every instance, the point is to get away from the "zeal" of those insisting on circumcision -- whom in the sense of the Roman Lex Cornelia de Sicarius of the First and Second Centuries CE can also be called "Sicarii" after the circumcizer's knife -- into the area of simple baptism or ritual immersion. In this instance, too, the "Ethiopian" Queen's name, "Kandakes," probably can be seen as another parody of one of Queen Helen's martyred descendants in the next generation, "Kenedaeos," one of the leaders of the first successful military operation against the Romans at the Pass at Beit Horon.
The usage of parody, then, is not limited to the Christian textual tradition, and includes the Rabbinic; it began with Josephus.
Despite what Josephus claims, there is no difference between Zealots and Sicarii - these labels actually describe the same people:
The lengthy account given by Josephus for the siege and fall of Masada, at the end of the 1st Jewish-Roman War, has Zealots and Sicraii fighting each other, then the Sicarii flee Jerusalem to Herod the Great's refuge-palace atop Masada, where after a lengthy siege, they commit suicide. This is another parody:
The suicide of Judas Iscariot (originally "the Sicarius") represents a mixing of elements that make more sense in their presumably earlier setting in the life of James and Jude. The suicide element (as well as the drawing of lots in the adjacent context in Acts 1) comes from the drawing of lots to begin the suicides of the Sicarii at Masada. The falling headlong comes from James' being pushed from the pinnacle of the temple, while the gushing out of his bowels reflects the dashing out of James' brains by the evil launderer. Like James, Acts' Judas is buried where he fell. (Price reviewing Eisenman)
Archaeological study of Masada contradicts Josephus:
Eisenman on the Name 'Iscariot'



But even without the benefit of the archaeological discoveries we would know that something is wrong with Josephus' story. According to the historian, when the Jews saw that the Roman ram was about to breach the wall, they hurriedly built an inner wall out of wood and earth which could absorb the force of the ram. When they broke through the outer wall, the Romans tried the ram on the inner wall but without success. Therefore they set it on fire. So far the narrative is plausible and probably true. The use of soft pliable material to blunt the effects of a ram and the construction of an inner wall to replace an outer one which is about to be destroyed were standard techniques in ancient siege warfare. The fact that the combination of these two techniques (the construction of an inner wall out of pliable material) is not readily paralleled elsewhere is double testimony to its veracity. Josephus cannot be accused of enriching his narrative with a tactic cribbed from a poliorketic manual and the Sicarii are credited with a manoeuvre which befits their inexperience in siege warfare--who builds a wall out of wood? Further confirmation may come from archaeology. Some large wooden beams were stripped from the Herodian palace before its destruction by fire perhaps to be used in the construction of this futile gesture. Confirmed or not the story is at least credible.
But the story soon loses its plausibility. After being blown about by the wind, the fire takes hold of the inner wall. At this point the Roman assault should have begun. The wall was breached, the inner wall was rapidly being consumed, the army was ready. Instead, the Romans withdraw, postponing the assault until the following morning. Their only activity that night was to maintain a careful watch lest any of the Jews escape. This is incredible. Why withdraw when victory was so close? Even if it was late afternoon or evening when the fire finally took to the wall, a point which Josephus does not make clear, Silva could have stormed the fortress by night, just as Vespasian did at Jotapata. Why wait? Furthermore, since the wall was breached, the Romans will have had to maintain a careful guard not only in their camps but especially on the ramp, in order to prevent the Jews from attacking the tower and the other siege machines. And yet, according to Josephus, the Roman soldiers positioned both on the ramp and on the tower, the former only a few feet from the inside of the fortress, the latter able to survey all of Masada, were oblivious to the activities of that eventful night. They did not notice that 960 men, women, and children were slain, and that at least two large fires were set, one destroying the accumulated possessions of the Sicarii, the other destroying the palace and cremating the corpses. They did not hear the shrieks of the women and children or see that the plateau was ablaze or sense that anything unusual was afoot. When the Romans stormed the fortress the next morning, they suspected nothing. They expected a battle but found silence. Very dramatic but utterly incredible.
- Masada: Literary Tradition, Archaeological Remains, and the Credibility of Josephus by Shaye Cohen Journal of Jewish Studies: Essays in honour of Yigael Yadin Vol. XXXIII, pp. 385-405 Spring-Autumn 1982



The Sicarii parody began with Josephus writing in the 1st century and took full form with Judas Iscariot: "Terrorist Jew" to be portrayed as an archetype "treacherous Jew" in the sacred texts which found their way into the New Testament.
Josephus also confuses the Sicarii with Zealots:
The term "zealot", in Hebrew kanai ( קנאי , frequently used in plural form, קנאים (kana'im)), means one who is zealous on behalf of God. The term derives from Greek ζηλωτής (zelotes), "emulator, zealous admirer or follower".
Josephus' Jewish Antiquities states that there were three main Jewish sects at this time, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. The Zealots were a "fourth sect", founded by Judas of Galilee (also called Judas of Gamala) and Zadok the Pharisee in the year 6 against Quirinius' tax reform, shortly after the Roman Empire declared what had most recently been the tetrarchy of Herod Archelaus to be a Roman province, and that they "agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord." (18.1.6)
But as we know better the identity of The Poor/Essenes/Nazirites and their Sicarii, they cannot be differentiated from Zealots, for they are all zealous for the Law; this is why they all oppose the innovations of the Idumaean monarchs ruling Judea and emperor cult of Rome. This was obvious to everyone in that period, so those reading how Josephus kept describing insurrectionists as "innovators" understood his use of language.
[As the historical framework of the New Testament is provided by the works of Josephus, it must be probable that the idea of parody, twisting everything around, originated from readers of his chronicles. We can imagine the hilarity these lies must



have caused among the Herodian readers safely ensconced in their Roman palaces and, after the 1st war, back on huge estates across Judea. They would never have imagined how later generations could be so simple. or ignorant, to have taken it all at face value.]
So maybe the Judas attached to Iscariot comes from Judas of Galilee:
Josephus does not relate the death of Judas, although he does report that Judas' sons James and Simon were executed by procurator Tiberius Julius Alexander in about 46 CE.
So we don't lose track of the Chrestians in this, there is a prominent one: procurator Tiberius Julius Alexander - Jew-hating son of the Alabarch in Alexandria (estate manager of Antonia Minor) and nephew of Philo the Jew.
Archaeological study of interments at Qumran support the contemporaneous, historical claims that the community was composed of clerical and secular sections, with the secular (men and women) living as normal, Observant Jews across Judea - these take arms and become, first, the insurrectionists against the monarchy and then the army fighting Rome. Sicarii, Zealots, they are the same.

Qumran was Jewish - Origins of Christianity
3-4 minutes
Qumran was Jewish
At an international conference on Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was announced that archaeologist Yonatan Adler had discovered nine small manuscript scrolls within three phylacteries excavated from caves 4 and 5 at the site in the 1950s. Specialists from the Israel Antiquities Authority used multispectral imaging to examine the 2,000-year-old scrolls. "Phylactery"? A revealing label. They are Jewish - :
And it shall be for a sign for you upon your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand did the LORD bring you out of Egypt.
And it shall be for a sign upon your hand, and as totafot between your eyes; for with a mighty hand did the LORD bring us forth out of Egypt.
The religion is all-important, because these artefacts help define Qumran as a pious, Jewish community. I've recently written about this: The Poor. This is a term used by the community, in its sacred texts, to describe itself. In their own language, they used the term Ebionim, from which comes Ebionite.
Most of the world (I'd guess) who know of the Dead Sea Scrolls must by now have seen the amazing parallels between The Poor and those using that term to describe themselves in the New Testament. The obvious - though wrong conclusion many make is that these biblical Poor are Christian.
However! That jump is based on false assumptions.
The first error is to imagine that Christians lived at Qumran. For a start, this community is a lot older than the modern era. It is devout Jewish, not a bunch of converts to something else. It is led by the Righteous Teacher, not the Spouter of Lies.
The second error is to imagine that there is a Christ or Christianity ca 25-30 CE. There is not a shred of evidence for these until very much later.



These assumptions are equally wrong in describing the community as JewishChristian, as some scholars have claimed: Price - "Eisenman shows how "Jewish Christianity" was part and parcel of the sectarian milieu which included Essenes, Zealots, Nazoreans, Nazirites, Ebionites, Elchasites, Sabeans, Mandaeans, etc..." - that's the error made when even the skeptical scholars fall for the Christian, textual tradition.
Qumran was rebuilt and in operation until the end of the 3rd Jewish-Roman war - a view taken from the archaeology there, coins and structures. The community ended for the final time when the Roman army crushed Judea, Jerusalem and Messianic Judaism.
All my history has done is say the obvious: the New Testament is parodying these Messianic Jews - Qumran, the authors of their texts buried there, James and his Ebionim/Nazirite followers including the Zealots/Sicarii.
If anyone disagrees, please explain how these people are Christian, following a Jesus Christ. Oh yes, and wearing tefillin on their arms and foreheads.

The mythological Nazareth - Origins of Christianity
9-12 minutes
Samson and Lions, Rome 350-400 CE. He was to be a Nazirite from birth.
Though we've seen repeatedly how there was neither a Jesus Christ, nor Christianity until well into the medieval period, and how the gospels (canonical et al) are literature (actually parody) rather than history, Christian apologists - including archaeologists - queue up to get their reward for pretending otherwise. Here, we'll take a glance at the mythological nonsense for the purported Nazareth of this Jesus Christ - and then, the paradoxical manner in which the name is used.
Nazareth is not mentioned in pre-Christian texts and appears in many different Greek forms in the New Testament. There is no consensus regarding the origin of the name.
The first non-Christian reference to Nazareth is an inscription on a marble fragment from a synagogue found in Caesarea Maritima in 1962. This fragment gives the town's name in Hebrew as " ("נצרת n-ṣ-r-t). The inscription dates to c. AD 300 and chronicles the assignment of priests that took place at some time after the Bar Kokhba revolt, AD 132-35. (See "Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods" below.) An 8th-century AD Hebrew inscription, which was the earliest known Hebrew reference to Nazareth prior to the discovery of the inscription above, uses the same form.
Much archaeology study has been invested in the area of the later Nazareth: Archaeology
Archaeological research has revealed that a funerary and cult center at Kfar HaHoresh, about two miles (3.2 km) from current Nazareth, dates back roughly 9000 years to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B era. The remains of some 65 individuals were found, buried under huge horizontal headstone structures, some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to identify Kfar HaHoresh as a major cult centre in that era.Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time. However, lack of archaeological evidence for Nazareth from Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic or Early Roman times, at least in the major excavations between 1955 and 1990, shows that the settlement apparently came to an abrupt end about 720 BC, when the Assyrians destroyed many towns in the area.James F. Strange, an American archaeologist, notes: "Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century CE."In 2009 Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre excavated archaeological remains in Nazareth that might date to the time of Jesus in the early Roman period. Alexandre told reporters, "The discovery is of the utmost importance since it reveals for the very first time a house from the Jewish village of Nazareth."A tablet at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, dating to 50 CE, was sent from Nazareth to Paris in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the "Ordinance of Caesar" that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However, it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly Sepphoris). Bagatti writes: “we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth, even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. At Nazareth there lived various vendors of antiquities who got ancient material from several places.”Although mentioned in the New Testament gospels, there are no extant non-biblical references to Nazareth until around 200 CE, when Sextus Julius Africanus, cited by Eusebius (Church History 1.7.14), speaks of “Nazara” as a village in "Judea" and locates it near an as-yet unidentified “Cochaba.”



For the Very First Time: A Residential Building from the Time of Jesus was Exposed in the Heart of Nazareth (12/21/09) An archaeological excavation the Israel Antiquities Authority recently conducted has revealed new information about ancient Nazareth from the time of Jesus. Remains of a dwelling that date to the Early Roman period were discovered for the first time in an excavation, which was carried out prior to the construction of the “International Marian Center of Nazareth” by the the Association Mary of Nazareth, next to the Church of the Annunciation.
"From the few written sources that there are..."
Even the Israeli Antiquities Authority justifies its own dig there (right) with unmentioned ancient sources, which I understand as this Africanus, so let us look at this a bit closer.
Little of Julius's life is known and all dates are uncertain.He wrote a history of the world...The history, which had an apologetic aim, is no longer extant, but copious extracts from it are to be found in the Chronicon of Eusebius, who used it extensively in compiling the early episcopal lists. There are also fragments in George Syncellus, Cedrenus and the Chronicon Paschale.
In short, we have nothing certain either of this source, or by him. Though he may have been based on some historical character, who that may have been is unknown; he is just another 'ghost' of the fraudulent textual tradition. Neither the IAA, nor anyone else, has any early source for Nazareth - all the experts are caught in that glittering web of false assumptions.
So when these bright archaeologists write their reports on the place - the place with no name in the 1st century - and talk about the home of Jesus, they are just more unicorns farting rainbows, signifying nothing.
Nazirite
Let us therefore now proceed to the serious scholarship on this question; how did IS Chrest - the divine man who actually appeared in the original New Testament texts - become known as the Nazirite?
In the Hebrew Bible, a nazirite or nazarite, (in Hebrew: נזיר , nazir), refers to one who voluntarily took a vow described in Numbers 6:1-21. "Nazarite" comes from the Hebrew word nazir meaning "consecrated" or "separated".In Modern Hebrew the word "nazir" is commonly used for monks, both Christian and Buddhist this meaning having largely displaced the original Biblical meaning.
As a parody, the New Testament is aimed at the authors' enemies. The original authors are Chrestians; their broad objective in Judea was to eradicate messianic Judaism; their specific target was the leadership of this faith, first John the Baptiser and after he was killed, James, the next Righteous Teacher (also killed, 62 CE).
The Teacher of Righteousness (in Hebrew: מורה הצדק Moreh ha-Tzedek) is a figure found in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran, most prominently in the Damascus Document. This document speaks briefly of the origins of the sect, probably Essenes, 390 years after the Babylonian exile and after 20 years of 'groping' blindly for the way. "God... raised for them a Teacher of Righteousness to guide them in the way of His heart". The Teacher is extolled as having proper understanding of the Torah, qualified in its accurate instruction, and being the one through whom God would reveal to the community “the hidden things in which Israel had gone astray”.
This monastic community settled at Qumran. I have described this here:
The Poor The Way James as ΙΥ, IC, ΙΣ Judas Iscariot



The Chrestian parody has largely been described by Professor Robert Eisenman:
As Hans-Joachim Schoeps had already surmised, the stoning of Stephen has in precisely the same way supplanted the stoning of James (actually a conflation of James' ultimate stoning at the command of Annanus and an earlier assault by Saul on the temple steps preserved as a separate incident in the Recognitions). The name Stephen has been borrowed from a Roman official beaten by Jewish insurgents whom Josephus depicts ambushing him outside the city walls. Why this name? Because of a pun: Stephen means "crown" and was suggested both by the long hair of the Nazirite (which James was, according to early church writers) and by the crown of martyrdom. To Stephen has been transferred James' declaration of the Son of Man at the right hand of God in heaven, as well as James' "Christlike" prayer for his persecutors. We read that a young man named Saul was playing coat check for the executioners of Stephen and, his taste for blood whetted, immediately began to foment persecution in Jerusalem and Damascus. This has been drawn, again from the lore of James as well as Josephus. The clothing motif was suggested by the final blow to James' head with a fuller's club, while just after his own account of James' death, Josephus tells of the rioting started by a Herodian named Saulus in Jerusalem!
Robert Eisenman's James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Viking Penguin, 1997. Reviewed by Robert M. Price
And more recently:
Put in another way, like Paul - we shall reserve judgement about James - they too were interested in nonJewish converts but, for them, 'circumcision' was a sine qua non, not only for conversion, but even to discuss questions pertaining to the Law. No wonder certain 'Zealots' (in particular, those Acts 21:21 denotes as the greater part of James' 'Jerusalem Church' adherents), 'Sicarii', or 'Nazirites' wished to kill Paul. As already remarked, this issue of 'abstaining from things sacrificed to idols' is the backbone of James' directives to overseas communities at the close of the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15:25 and 15:29. It is reiterated in Acts 21:26 when Paul is sent into the Temple by James for a Nazirite-style penance because the majority of James' supporters are - even in the language of Acts 21:21 - 'Zealots for the Law.' 'Sicarii Essenes,' 'Those of the Circumcision,' and Qumran by Robert Eisenman, 25 May 2014
We can therefore see how - whether Nazareth, or Nazarene - Chrestians wrote in parody and this parody has since been used by Chrestians, Christians and Buddhists.

"The Pierced Messiah Text"
The War of the Messiah is a series of Dead Sea scroll fragments describing the conclusion of a battle led by the Leader of the Congregation. The fragments that make up this document include 4Q285, also known as The Pierced Messiah Text, and 11Q14 with which it was found to coincide.
Dead Sea scrolls/4Q285
Thanks to a questioning reader prompting me to research further the subject of messianic Judaism in the first century CE, I think that I've found both the particular casus belli for Chrestians and the manuscript trail from Chrestians in the first century, to the authorship of the first gospel account.
If you Google 'messianic Judaism' then you are likely to be presented with Jews and Judaism in modern times, but this is not what we need to understand the end of Second Temple Judaism and the rise of Chrestianity. Well, I've searched a number of times over the years and only now (is my ignorance revealed and) do I think we have artefactual evidences to answer both questions.
My notes are available here: Qumran messiah
Most of the scholarly arguments on this do not yet concern me or the history I'm writing, so fortunately, we can take a simple approach.
The Poor community at Qumran were, according the War Scroll, expecting war with the Herodian monarchy and Rome; the Jews were to be led by one or more messiahs.



The Pierced Messiah Text (4Q285)
This six-line fragment, commonly referred to as the "Pierced Messiah" text, is written in a Herodian script of the first half of the 1st Century and refers to the "stump of Jesse"—the Messiah—from the Branch of David, to a judgement, killing, and cleansing of the land of the dead by the Messiah's soldiers - The War of the Messiah
This is what frightened the Greco-Roman elite across the eastern empire, the heartland of Chrestianity in the early period of the modern era.
Josephus describes Saul's attacks on The Poor. John and James suffered extra-judicial killing by the Herodian monarchy; killing the messiah was a logical step for the Chrestians.
This piece (in the Qumran messiah folder) BAR articles on the Pierced/Piercing Messiah Text (4Q285), describes some of the arguments. However, I am more concerned with how The Poor held a view of the messiah different in an important regard from the later portrayal of the messiah.
What we have is a textual record of how Chrestians perverted, parodied even, the Qumran messiah.
I have made comments here: Chrestian editors of Baruch
The gospel account - Q or otherwise - emerged from this.
I suggest that using the fall of Jerusalem to set the textual date may be wrong, for its total destruction was byAquila, as he built Aelia Capitolina for Hadrian. The gospel literature post-dates Hadrian. Baruch (with its alterations) is the literary link; extracts from Chrestian editors of Baruch:
Origin.
That the first part of the book was originally written in Hebrew is probable...
Date and Authorship.
Baruch borrows from Daniel; the hypothesis that Daniel borrows from Baruch or that both draw from earlier material being less satisfactory. Here, however, a difficulty is encountered. In ii. 26 the Temple is said to be in ruins—a statement which accords with two periods only, those of the Chaldean and the Roman conquests. As the former period is out of the question, certain scholars, such as Kneucker, for example, assign this part of the book to a time later than the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. It is difficult, however, to reconcile with such a date the view of the dead given in ii. 17, where it is said that those whose spirits have been taken from their bodies will not ascribe honor and righteousness to the Lord. This statement is in accordance with the Old-Hebrew conception of the life in Sheol, which can scarcely have been current after the year 70 of the common era.
Date of First Part
Some recent writers see in the names of the two Babylonian princes an allusion to Vespasian and Titus, which is a plausible assumption if ii. 26a be retained. The date given in i. 2, the "fifth year," is obscure; it may mean the fifth year after the fall of Jerusalem (B.C. 581), or, more probably, may be taken from Ezekiel, whose epoch is the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity (B.C. 592). But there is no reason for supposing (as, for example, from Jer. xxix. and li.) that Baruch was ever in Babylon. Though there are difficulties in any hypothesis, it seems probable, upon the whole, that the first part of Baruch is composed of two confessions, which an editor in the Maccabean time combined, prefixing the statement about Baruch.
Date of Second Part.
Kneucker, Marshall, and several other recent critics, however, place its composition after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus, holding that the "strange nation" of iv. 3 ("give not thine honor . . . to a strange nation") refers to the Christians, and relates to a time when the antagonism between Judaism and Christianity had become pronounced. While this is possible, the expression may also be understood to allude to the antagonism between Judaism and Hellenism in the second century B.C. The verse iii. 37 ("afterward did he



[or it] show himself [or itself] upon earth and converse with men"), which was much quoted by early Christian writers, interrupts the connection and is undoubtedly a Christian interpolation. The second poem (iv. 5-v. 9) belongs to the same general period as the first. It is divided into a number of strophes, each beginning with the words "Be of good cheer." The people, scattered and afflicted, are exhorted to trust in God; and Jerusalem, mourning over her children, is urged to take courage. The picture accords either with the late Maccabean period or with the time soon after the Roman capture of Jerusalem.
Canonicity.
It was, however, accepted by the Alexandrian Jews as a work of edification; and through the medium of the Septuagint it passed into the hands of the Christians
My comments:

accepted by the Alexandrian Jews as a work of edification; and through the medium of the Septuagint it passed into the hands of the Christians
These Alexandrian Jews who passed it on to the Christians – i.e. Chrestians – are likely to have been either the family of the alabarch, or their followers.
Winning the war(s) required theological elements, a messiah and resurrection. We already know of Saul attackingThe Poor and then penetrating Qumran; he is also the agent of Helen of Adiabene in providing grain to a starving Judea; we may surmise he helped prevent her full conversion to Judaism; his fakery is later described in parody as his conversion on the road to Damascus. Though he didn't know either the IS Chrest of the original texts, nor the laterJesus Christ, he sure knew the messiah at Qumran. He is the logical source for providing Qumran's texts to his Herodian and Roman masters.
Whether or not Chrestians believed any of their mythical and religious nonsense, we cannot know, but they sure knew what The Poor believed and they knew how to parody that.

Evidence-based history
The orthodox history of this period is backward looking, interpreting selective data through the beliefs of later times. With reliable dating to establish a secure chronology, the perspective offered here does the opposite, following the development of ideas through the archaeological record of successive generations.
We approach the information tabula rasa, in a scientific manner, with no prior judgements or biases. The archaeological record is allowed to speak for itself as much as possible. Similarly, expert opinion is often quoted where appropriate, linked to the source.
The introduction provides a brief summary, based on our reading of the evidences. Excavations are on-going, new artefacts (including texts) come to light and as we gain both new technologies and better methods, so we should expect more. Though much evidence has been destroyed over the centuries, there is good reason to be optimistic for better, more complete interpretation in future.

A Qumran messiah to rise from the dead in three days
This unprovenanced, limestone tablet was likely found near the Dead Sea some time around the year 2000 and has been associated with the same community which created the Dead Sea scrolls. Israel Knohl, an expert in Talmudic and biblical language at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, read in line 80 of the inscription a command from the angel Gabriel "to rise from the dead within three days".
The scholarly arguments for the translation of this tablet do not concern me over-much, for Christian apologists are bound to contest the historicity of this messiah.
The Qumran scriptorium (L30)
That the same messianic, observant Jews at the Qumran monastic community produced messianic texts, as I
mentioned in The Qumran messiah, Chrestian hostility and their gospel messiah, makes unarguable that they had one, or two messiahs, probably in the early-first century.
Retired professor Stan Seidner...does agree with Knohl's interpretation of the inscription,"to rise from the dead within three days."[Seidner, Stanley S. "The Knohl Hypothesis and 'Hazon Gabriel,'" June 3, 2009.]

Contact
Inkwell found at Qumran
The writing dates to the same period and uses the same tidy calligraphic Hebrew script as some of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
To my mind, this proves my case that the New Testament (and the various, earlier works of which it is comprised) is parody. James did not belong to two, different sects at the same time, Qumran with its messiah, and a non-existent Christianity with its non-existent divine man (IS Chrest, or Jesus Christ).
The only challenge I make to the understanding of this text is its date.
13. [Thus] said the Lord, God of Israel, now all the nations14. ... enc[amp] on Jerusalem and from it are exi[led]15. one two three forty Prophets and the elders16. and the Hasidim.
Though this could refer to the siege and fall of Jerusalem in the First Jewish-Roman War, it could, alternatively, refer to the erasure of the city as Hadrian had Aquila of Sinope build Aelia Capitolina on the site.
But whatever, Qumran had a messiah or two and he was not Jesus Christ, or Christian, or even Chrestian.
A brief note on my book project: The publisher's editor has just read the first part of my submission and responded with "Lovely, thank you". She has also clarified what is expected: a "normal history"; I had earlier offered an alternative, my voyage of discovery, how the study revealed the history to me. Other than that, she is demanding that I make more rapid progress. Oh dear, back to work.

Annunciation - Origins of Christianity
24-31 minutes
One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) (Acts 11:28)
After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, "The Holy Spirit says, 'In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'" When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. Then Paul answered, "Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, "The Lord's will be done." (Acts 21:12)
I must apologise for returning to this subject, but a series of papers examining these rulers has prompted me to re-assess.
First, why this is important: The angelic annunciation for Izates (ca. 1 BCE-1 CE and noted by the first-century Judean chronicler Josephus) became in the canonical gospels that of IS XP/Chrest, known centuries later as Jesus Christ:
Tomb of Queen Helena, whose sarcophagas reads "Sara"



About this time it was that Helena, queen of Adiabene, and her son Izates, changed their course of life, and embraced the Jewish customs, and this on the occasion following: Monobazus, the king of Adiabene, who had also the name of Bazeus, fell in love with his sister Helena, and took her to be his wife, and begat her with child. But as he was in bed with her one night, he laid his hand upon his wife's belly, and fell asleep, and seemed to hear a voice, which bid him take his hand off his wife's belly, and not hurt the infant that was therein, which, by God's providence, would be safely born, and have a happy end. This voice put him into disorder; so he awakened immediately, and told the story to his wife; and when his son was born, he called him Izates. (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews - Book XX)
In Luke, that passage became:
In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”
Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 30 But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favour with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.”
“How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[a] the Son of God. Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. For no word from God will ever fail.”
“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.
The first sentence (above) tells us this is in parody, because Nazareth is given as the place and as I described in The mythological Nazareth, that name is a parody of Nazarite, a title applied to James the Righteous Teacher.
The Annunciation - Constantinople silk twill. The Vatican.
And in Matthew:
This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name IS, because he will save his people from their sins.”
The annunciation for Izates/IS prefigures and so becomes the prototype for IS Chrest, the Isa of the Koran. The question this has long prompted of me is: who is Izates, for there is no contemporaneous archaeological or historical record for him? I will try here to answer this clearly.
Where did Luke find his raw material for the prophecy of Agabus of a great famine to transpire in Claudius' reign, of Paul's trip from Antioch to deliver famine relief funds to Jerusalem, and for the earlier tale of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch? Again, from Josephus (though perhaps also from other cognate sources of information). It all stems, by hook and by crook, from the story of Helen, Queen ofAdiabene, a realm contiguous and/or overlapping with Edessa, whose king Agbar/Abgarus some sources make Helen's husband. Helen and her son Izates converted to Judaism, though initially Izates refrained from circumcision on the counsel of a Jewish teacher who assured him the worship of God was more important than circumcision. His mother, too, advised against it, since his subjects might resent his embracing of such alien customs. But soon a stricter Jewish teacher from Jerusalem, one Eliezer, visited Izates, finding him poring over the Genesis passage on the Abrahamic covenant of circumcision.... When the prophet Agabus predicts the famine, Luke has derived his name from that of Helen's husband Agbarus. When the eunuch invites Philip to step up into his chariot, we have an echo of Jehu welcoming Jonadab into his chariot. When Philip asks the Ethiopian if he understands what he reads,Luke



has borrowed this from the story of Izates and Eliezer, where the question also presages a ritual
conversion, only this time the text is Isaiah's prophecy of Jesus, and the ritual is baptism. The original circumcision survives in the form of crude parody (recalling Galatians 5:12) with the Ethiopian having been fully castrated. Even the location of the Acts episode is dictated by the Helen story, as the Ethiopian travels into Egypt via Gaza as Helen's agents must have in order to buy the grain. Luke's substituted motivation for the trip, by contrast, is absurd: a eunuch could not have gone to Jerusalem to worship since eunuchs were barred from the Temple!
(Robert Eisenman's James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Viking Penguin, 1997; Reviewed by Robert M. Price) [Emphasis mine.]
The eunuch parody here is not new: it was played also with the fictional Origen of Alexandria. This was partly to insult and partly to associate with the Cybelene "Day of Blood"- the source of Easter, another parody:
March 24: Sanguem or Dies Sanguinis ("Day of Blood"), a frenzy of mourning when the devotees whipped themselves to sprinkle the altars and effigy of Attis with their own blood; some performed the selfcastrations of the Galli. The "sacred night" followed, with Attis placed in his ritual tomb.[Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 167; Lancellotti, Attis, Between Myth and History, p. 82.]
Taurobolium, or Consecration of the Priests of Cybele under Antoninus Pius . Engraving by Bernhard Rode (undated)
The place of its performance at Rome was near the site of St Peter's, in the excavations of which several altars and inscriptions commemorative of taurobolia were discovered.
The dates for this bloody ritual tell us something about how late is the textual tradition it parodies.
Michał Marciak, who I'd say has studied Izates more extensively than any other recent scholar, describes the Izates of Josephus as (1) a second Joseph (of Genesis), shaped to a pro-Roman agenda, and (2) a second Hezekiah, king of ancient Judea (invaded by Sennacherib in 701 BCE). Why? The greatest event in the life and times of Josephus was the First Jewish-Roman War, in which he was a traitor, working for imperial Rome; he was trying to justify himself by saying that the rebels deserved the annihilation they got and if they'd been more like this Izates, they would have kept peace with Rome.
This does not mean that Izates has no substance, just that the historical is going to be somewhat different to that in the fictional accounts by Josephus, who erased Edessa and its Arab kings from history, and of course, very different to the



biblical parodies.
Her sarcophagus is inscribed twice with her name.
We find a similar situation for his mother, Helen:
...the whole story of the Queen of Adiabene requires us to take note of the very long tradition involving powerful women called Helen and the deep symbolism of the name – reaching back to Troy, and to the moon deity Selene whose personality was claimed by a contemporary and namesake of Helene of Adiabene, Helena the companion of Simon Magus. Her activities, three centuries before those of Constantine’s mother, resemble them very closely. Both women were converted to a new faith and both probably influenced their sons’ conversions – in Helen of Adiabene’s case, to the Jewish faith. Both built public monuments in the Holy City. Both adorned holy places. Both were long remembered for their piety.
(Helena of the Cross, the Queen of Adiabene, and Royal myth-making in the Holy City by Graham Jones)
As regard her two names on her sarcophagus:
...abbreviating the Syriac to speak only of ‘Sara Melaka’ (Queen Sarah). The inference is clear for a Jewish audience: an implicit indication that Helen adopted the Jewish name biblically borne by the wife of Abraham, who like her travelled to the Holy Land from Mesopotamia.
In short, Josephus does not tell us the historical names for Helen (before her conversion to Judaism) and Izates; we do not have to believe all he tells us, even the name of their kingdom, Adiabene.
I think that the name, or at least the dynastic title of Izates is revealed in the letter found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, known in short as MMT. A paper by Eisenman reveals this: MMT as 'Jamesian' Letter to 'the Great King of the Peoples beyond the Euphrates' (or Izates)
Few doubt the Mishnaic nature of it's Hebrew and therefore its probable rather late provenance as compared to other documents. The fact that it is apparently the single letter or letters extant in Qumran, not to mention the fact of multiple copies, also attests to its importance. Its Jamesian elements include the ban on "things sacrified to idols," "fornication," gifts from Gentiles in the Temple and even "carrion." What can perhaps be called its Abrahamic" provenance should also be clear.
This James is the Righteous Teacher in the Dead Sea Scrolls and of the Qumran community, parodied in the New Testament as brother of the Lord and so on.
The title for Izates in MMT is Abgarus:
The name "Abgarus", to my knowledge, has never been fully delineated, whether a proper noun or a title meaning "Great King". In any event, in first-second century Syria, before the Romans suppressed this Kingdom ( and with it that of Adiabene), during Trajan's campaigns in the East ending in 117 CE, the name occurs so regularly among rulers, that it appears to take on something of the sense of a royal title in the manner of "Caesar" or "Herod", or even "Aretas" further West. The same can be said for "Monobazus" or "Bazeus" in Josephus' version of similar events.



The sacred fish of Atargatis in Edessa, whose mythology is transferred to Abraham.
To emphasise, Abgarus is not the name of, but a title; the same for Monobazus. Now we'll take a quick look at these kings, who are not found in Adiabene, but next door:
In the second half of the 2nd century BC, as the Seleucid monarchy disintegrated in the wars with Parthia (145–129), Edessa became the capital of the Abgar dynasty, who founded the Kingdom of Osroene (also known in history as Kingdom of Edessa). This kingdom was established by Nabataean or Arab tribes from North Arabia, and lasted nearly four centuries (c. 132 BC to 214), under twenty-eight rulers, who sometimes called themselves "king" on their coinage. (Edessa)
King Abgar holding the Image of Edessa.
Here is Izates as Abgarus:
Abgar V the Black or Abgarus V of Edessa BC 4 – AD 7 and AD 13–50) was an historical Aramean-Syriac ruler of the kingdom of Osroene, holding his capital at Edessa. [Vailhé, Siméon. "Edessa." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909.] (Abgar V)
And again, we find the textual tradition (the 'glittering web') lying in wait; first, Eisenman:
According to Eusebius, the "Agbar" or "Abgar" in question ( I prefer to use the former, because of its clear connection with the garbled "Agabus" in Acts and the matter of the Famine or Famine-relief) was actually called "Agbar Uchama", which would be Abgar V ( d. c. 50 CE) or "Abgar the Black". Why he was called "black" in Edessene chronicles ( unless he was black) has again, to my knowledge, never been adequately explained; but it is important, especially when linked up with Acts' version of these events in the story about "the Ethiopian Queen's eunuch" -- "Ethiopian eunuch", as I will show, being the operative words here. It should be noted that the "Agabus" story occurs in proximity in Acts with the story about the "Famine-relief" activities Paul undertakes, from a place it is choosing to call "Antioch", where it thinks the first real "Christian" community was set down by Paul and Barnabas ( 11:26-30).



We see immediately more parody in the New Testament, this time drawing in Helen. Here's another, this time of the Jamesean letter MMT.
The legend tells that Abgar, king of Edessa, afflicted with an incurable sickness, probably leprosy, had heard the fame of the power and miracles of Jesus and wrote to him, acknowledging his divinity, craving his help, and offering him asylum in his own residence; the tradition states that Jesus wrote a letter, commending Abgar on his faith, but declining to go, but promising that after his ascension, he would send one of his disciples, endowed with his power.[Hoiberg, Dale H., ed. (2010). "Abgar legend". Encyclopedia Britannica. I: A-ak Bayes (15th ed.). Chicago, IL: Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. p. 30.] (The legend of King Abgar)
I've interpreted before the purpose of Source Q: Bardaisan (of Edessa and best friend of its king in the second half of the second century) was trying to justify the overthrow of its governor, under the rule of the family of Izates/Abgarus. We therefore should not be surprised how Dura fragment 24 is concerned with the trial of the divine man IS:

Similarly, a fresco of the associated Dura baptistery concerns the death of this divine man.



Women at the tomb, Dura Europos baptistery, early third century
There probably many imperial changes to Source Q, on its way to becoming a canonical gospel and similarly, the Dura baptistery was imperially-sanctioned, as it must have been. Source Q was by Bardaisan, the others were after the emperor had him and the king killed. What remains is the tale of Barabbas:
Barabbas or Jesus Barabbas (a Hellenization of the Aramaic bar abba בר אבא , literally "son of the father" or "Jesus, son of the Father" respectively) is a figure mentioned in the accounts of the Passion of Christ, in which he is an insurrectionary whom Pontius Pilate freed at the Passover feast in Jerusalem, instead of releasing Jesus.
Gotarzes II of Parthia cut off the ears of Meherdates
This custom of release has no historicity; it is an invention by gospel authors and a known, Greek literary device (The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark by Dennis MacDonald). Why Barabbas at all then? He is Izates/Abgarus and Bardaisan is trying to illustrate how he was not the rightful king, who should have been the ancestor of his friend, the second-century king. Insurrectionary, or Zealot (zealous for the law) is how Izates/Abgarus is seen after his full conversion to Judaism and his support for James, and his community.
Abgar V Ukkama, famous in Christendom as the contemporary of Jesus (see below), was a member of a delegation that went to Zeugma in A.D. 49 to welcome Mehrdād, the Roman nominee to the throne of Parthia. The “dishonest” Abgar, Tacitus relates (Annals 12.12ff.), detained the prince “day after day in the town of Edessa,” evidently pandering to the dissipation of the “inexperienced youth.” Only when winter had set in did Abgar lead Mehrdād by a circuitous route through the mountains of Armenia. And before his protégé could put his challenge to the test of battle, the king of Edessa had abandoned him to certain defeat and capture by Gōdarz. (ABGAR dynasty of Edessa, 2nd century B.C. to 3rd century A.D.)



2000-year-old mosaic uncovered by archaeologists in the Turkish city of Zeugma
Bardaisan clearly held Rome at least partly responsible for this unseating of the family dynasty, hence Pontius Pilate, and this provided Caracalla and his mother, Julia Domna, ample reason (i.e. treason) to have the two killed. Then, of course, Caracalla was killed near Harran in Upper Mesopotamia, on return from his sneak attack on Adiabene; Julia Domna then killed herself; their religio-political needs disappeared with them.
These little kingdoms are not unimportant to history, for a Silk Road route ran though them, gathering riches for their merchants and rulers; they were the buffer states between the empires of East and West. When they joined with James, Herod Agrippa and messianic Judaism, this became a power bloc in its own right; Hellenistic Jews would have been fearful (if only of the forced conversions by Sicarii). This was the reasoning of Herodian aristocrat Saul, his kinsman Costobarus, the likes of Josephus and the Chrestians.
But when Monobazus was grown old, and saw that he had but a little time to live, he had a mind to come to the sight of his son before he died. So he sent for him, and embraced him after the most affectionate manner, and bestowed on him the country called Carra; it was a soil that bare amomum in great plenty: there are also in it the remains of that ark, wherein it is related that Noah escaped the deluge, and where they are still shown to such as are desirous to see them. (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews - Book XX, Chapter II.)
Lastly, I must mention the religious roots of this small region east of the Euphrates - it was the country of Abraham and Noah, giving much authority to its leaders.
He said: "God promised that country to Abraham and to his son after him, for eternity. And what had been promised was fulfilled during that time when [God] loved Israel. Now, however, you are the sons of Abraham, and God shall fulfill the promise made to Abraham and his son on you. Only love the God of Abraham, and go and take the country which God gave to your father, Abraham. No one can successfully



resist you in war, since God is with you." (The Armenian chronicler Sebeos, Bishop of the Bagratunis, writing in the 660s CE.)
The region of this Haran (Harran, in present-day Turkey) is referred to variously as Paddan Aram and Aram Naharaim. Abram lived there until he was 75 years old before continuing his journey. Although Abram's nephew Lot accompanied him to Canaan, other descendants of Terah remained in Paddan-Aram, where Abraham's grandson Jacob sought his parents' relatives, namely Laban, for whom he worked for twenty years in Haran. In the New Testament, Haran is mentioned in the Book of Acts (7:2–4), in a recounting of the story in Genesis wherein it first appears. (Haran (biblical place))
Sanliurfa (Edessa) [E City Gate. Arab tent and Arabs in foreground]. By Gertrude Bell May 1911
This is why it remains so significant today, to all the Abrahamic religions. Eisenman:
Not only is the ”Arab" ancestry of all these stories (an ancestry the Paulinizing narrative of the Book of Acts is quick to relegate to "Ethiopia") important; so is the connecting theme of the ban on "things sacrificed to idols," the basis not only of Koranic dietary regulations, but also that of the Qumran letter known as MMT’s polemicizing directives aimed at a pious king, wishing to emulate Abraham. It is also the focus of Acts' picture of James' directives to overseas communities and Paul’s diminution of these in 1 Corinthians 8, where because of them he disingenuously concludes he "will never eat meat again forever" and for him, ”all things are lawful."



Zeus, Hera, and Amor observe the birth of Helen and the Dioscuri (1550)
The conclusion is that somehow Muhammad came in touch with these Northern Syrian conversion stories and other quasi-Syriac materials from the Pseudoclementine Recognitions and Homilies about James either through caravan trips to Southern Iraq, where the ”Subba of the Marshes” are still to be found, or further north, to the remnants of these lost civilizations in Northern Syria. In all these contexts, the constant emphasis on “Abraham," whose homeland this was, is particularly persuasive. Not only is Abraham a locus for the genesis of Koranic doctrine about Islam, but also for the antecedents to this-the debates between Paul and lames regarding Abraham’s salvationary state that permeate the history of early Christianity. The Qumran Damascus Document also focuses on Abraham, insisting that because he and Isaac and Jacob ”kept the commandments" and remained faithful," they were to be reckoned ”beloved of God" or ”friends,” an expression approximated in Surah 2 of the Koran by that of "Muslim.” It is this context, which in our view throws light on these otherwise seemingly garbled and certainly very obscure Koranic references. Furthermore, these connections will throw light on Muhammad’s constant allusion, in connection with these “warning” episodes, to both Abraham" and ”the People of Noah,” in the context of which he also alludes to the ark. The Koran also refers to this region as being of broad plains, richly fertile with olive trees, and the like. As it turns out, this is precisely the description of these Northern Syrian venues, Haran/"The Land of the Osrhoeans,” in which the conversions, ascribed to Judas Thomas" (”Hud"/"Thamud") and “Addai”/"Thaddaeus" ("Ad"), transpire. For Josephus, the Talmud, and early Christian sources, this is the area where the ark came to rest, or "Ararat," which, unlike modern legends, these consistently locate in the Land of the Adiabeni or Abraham's Haran. In the Koran, too, the ark is always a fixture of background allusions to these "Arabian" prophet stories. For the Romans, all these lands were ”Arab" or ”Arabian” and their kings repeatedly called ”Arab,” that is, ”Arabs" were not just from the Arabian Peninsula, but also the lands of Northern Syria and Mesopotamia known as Edessa and Adiabene -also possibly alluded to in Paul's celebrated reference to ”Arabia" in Galatians.

Conclusion



Though I have said repeatedly over the last few years how the canonical (i.e.imperial) gospels and the New Testament as a whole are a Chrestian parody of messianic Judaism and post-Hadrian (i.e. after the resurrection of Antinous and the end of the three Jewish-Roman Wars), here is further confirmation of this view.
The name Izates is an invention of Josephus. Books of the New Testament were drawn heavily on the works of Josephus. The accounts by Josephus of both Izates and Helen are religio-political allegories, and this was obvious to the author of Source Q (and almost certainly to the educated elite of the Roman Levant.
They demonstrate:
the period of gospel authorship (third century, with later development); imperial sponsorship; how the kingdoms of Adiabene and Osroene were probably ruled by the same family in the early-first century, and the king's title is Agbarus; this king Agbarus converted to Judaism, allied to Herod Agrippa - also known as Herod or Agrippa I (11 BCE – 44 CE) - and recognised the religious authority of the Qumran community, especially James; while Rome probably supported Agbarus to some extent, Chrestians saw him clearly as at least their potential enemy, as did the family ruling from Edessa previously.
We also see the twin issue, more overtly with the earthly IS Barabbas and the divine IS Chrest, which confirms the pagan, Greek literary origin; less overtly with the Josephus tale for "Izates" and his brother who rules at the convenience of "Izates" and then conveniently steps aside. The Josephus tale has been interpreted in such a fashion, fitting the new genre of the early-third century.
The fairy story for Helen and Izates by Josephus, the royal tombs at Jerusalem and the historical background his chronicles provide, along with Plutarch detailing the Isis Myth, probably also provided the impetus for Source Q, along with the personal motive to justify the new royal dynasty at Edessa.

Helen and Izates - Origins of Christianity
1-1 minutes
According to the main historical source for Judea in the 1st century (Josephus), Izates was an important king in the north, who converted to Judaism. His future importance - an Annunciation - was announced by an angel. His mother, Helen, made a partial conversion. They impact New Testament accounts and appear in the 'Apocrypha'. Yet neither exist in any other contemporaneous record - no coins, statue, or reference. Clearly, these accounts are trying to tell us something important - so important, it has to be told discretely.

Queen Helen of Adiabene - not a Chrestian - Origins of Christianity
7-8 minutes
Stele of Antiochus and Helios from Zeugma
I am getting to the point where I have to finalise my position on Helen, queen of Adianene, and her son, Izates; I regard this as critical to understanding the Chrestian position (against the messianic Judaism of the 1st and 2nd centuries of the modern era) and how Chrestian texts (mis)treat these characters. I now suspect that I have been deliberately misled by the sources.
Earlier in Google+, I posted:
The archaeology of his mother's mausoleum and the richness of her gifts to the (Herodian-controlled) Temple and to Judea, place her, I suggest, as a compatriot of the Jerusalem 'Rich', those opposed to the Poor, the observant and mainly Messianic Jews led from Qumran. Her conversion to Judaism had been partial, along the same lines as promoted by the literary St Paul and Christian Church. Josephus mentions two missionaries to her, though names only Ananias; the New Testament names the man who converted Saul as Ananias; and according to the textual tradition, Saul was Helen's agent in supplying grain to Judea. These all suggest to me that Saul was an agent of Helen and together, they opposed the Messianic Jews at Qumran, and therefore supported the Herodian monarchy. Her palace complex in Jerusalem, recently excavated, seems to confirm this. Helen was in Jerusalem when Izates died, so she didn't personally kill him, though she was well-placed to avoid suspicion whilst colluding with the Herodians.
The sources above are mainly dependent on Josephus and (other) Chrestians; the putative relationship between the Herodian and Chrestian Saul (later resurrected as Saint Paul) is not described by Helen, or anyone in her kingdom, but by those who wrote of Saul/Paul, i.e. Chrestians. The New Testament is black parody in the Chrestian war against messianic Judaism, the movement led by John the Baptiser and after his killing, James the Righteous Teacher (until his killing in 62); this literary source is not historical, but propaganda.



South frieze. Detail: Priests, Agrippa, Asiatic princess and son (Iotape of Commagene and probably Antiochus III), Livia, Tiberius, Antonia, Drusus I. From G. Moretti Ara Pacis Augustae (1948)
Ara Pacis Augustae, Rome, Via della Ripetta.
A suggestion of the web is that Helen is actually:
Julia Iotapa, or simply Iotapa (before 17-around 52), daughter of King Antiochus III of Commagene, was Queen of Commagene, consort of her King brother Antiochus IV.
While Iotapa and Antiochus were growing up in Rome, they were a part of the remarkable court of Antonia Minor.
Julia Iotapa appeared to have died before Commagene was annexed by Roman Emperor Vespasian in 72.
I reject this suggestion because Izates was born ca.1 CE, too early for her, and we know all her children, none of whom come close to matching Izates. Julia Iotapa is Chrestian, raised as such by Antonia Minor. Helen of Adiabene is not Chrestian, as Eisenman demonstrates:
In the context of Izates’ life, too, the allusion to David’s “sufferings” and “being forgiven” are important, clearly part of the encouragement to “work Righteousness”. Since in Josephus’ story of both Queen Helen’s conversion, backed up in Rabbinic sources, and her son Izates, this theme plays an important role. I can think of no similar situation among Maccabeans or Herodians - the other possibilities - that can be readily cited. That Helen of Adiabene and her sons, Izates and Monobazus, were extremely interested in gifts or sacrifices in the Temple is documented in Talmudic materials as well. These dwell on the golden lampstead she and her sons were said to have contributed to the Temple. Helen, it should be observed, was also interested in the matter of “fornication”, as she was also said to have donated a plaque with “the suspected adultress” passages from Num 5:13-31 inscribed on it in gold for display in the Temple. It should not be overlooked, that following this in Num 6:121, as well, are the strictures relating to Naziritism and,from Rabbinic sources too, we hear that this was one of her consuming passions too. In fact, because of a vow she took regarding Izates’ safe-keeping in war ( additional materials having to do with her and her sons’ “sufferings” ), we hear she took three consecutive, seven-year Nazirite vows of abstinence.
- The Sociologogy of MMT and the Conversions of King Agbarus and Queen Helen of Adiabene
Helen's relationship with Judea existed during part of the reign of Herod Agrippa (11 BCE – 44 CE), who is treated in biblical texts as a traitor, because although raised by Antonia Minor, on his return to Judea, he dropped that façade to become a popular, pro-Judean hero. Her Nazirite position aligns her perfectly with James. This is why the Jesus of Nazareth myth.
In summary, there was a largely-undeclared war (from early in the first century) between the states ruled by colonial-Greek regimes of the eastern Roman Empire (from Asia Minor, south to Egypt and across North Africa), most of which in the early-first century had - through the work of Antonia Minor) - adopted Chrestianity, and messianic Judaism, led by the monastic community at Qumran and in the early-first century, Herod Agrippa. The three Jewish-Roman Wars are an expression of this conflict, which was mainly cultural (ideological and theological, since theinvasion and occupation by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, ('manifestation of the god').
Further developments occurred in Judaea Province in the year 130, when Emperor Hadrian visited the Eastern Mediterranean and, according to Cassius Dio, made the decision to rebuild the city of Jerusalem as the Roman city of Aelia Capitolina, derived from his own name. The decision, together with Hadrian's



other sanctions against the Jews, was allegedly one of the reasons for the eruption of the 132 Bar Kokhba revolt — an extremely violent uprising. The rebellion ended with the deaths of most of the Judaean population and a ban upon the Jewish faith across the Roman Empire, which was lifted in 137, upon Hadrian's death. - Aftermath, Kitos War
The Chrestian side looked to Helios, always syncretised with local sun gods and trinities; it struggled with the emperors following Augustus to gain the military support needed to stay in power, until they placed Vespasian as emperor; part of the payment they made for Roman military support was to send troops to join Rome in attacking Judea. Only when they had won, signalled by the end of the Third Jewish-Roman War, were Chrestians in a position to start writing their textual tradition, as black propaganda, parodying both messianic Judaism and its leaders - which includes Helen and Izates. This is the first example of damnatio memoriae used by Chrestianity.

Syncretisms - Origins of Christianity
John Bartram, 3 Jul 2014, 22:30 ⋮ 8-10 minutes
Students of either Classical Antiquity or comparative religion soon discover this concept:
Syncretism is the combining of different, often seemingly contradictory beliefs, while melding practices of various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merger and analogizing of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths.
The word itself first appears, appropriately enough considering this subject, with Plutarch:
The Greek word occurs in Plutarch's (1st century AD) essay on "Fraternal Love" in his Moralia (2.490b). He cites the example of the Cretans, who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. "And that is their so-called Syncretism".
The term becomes particularly important in treating the impact of one, dominant culture (such as Greek, then Roman) on another (Egypt):
Religious syncretism
Religious syncretism exhibits blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in the culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or, especially, practices.
In Classical Antiquity, syncretism becomes important as Alexander conquered the Iranian empire, then Greek colonies were founded - often naming their cities Alexandria - from India to Egypt:

Syncretism: 25 Concepts in Anthropology



Amun is mentioned as a deity in the Hebrew Bible, and in the Nevi'im, texts presumably written in the 7th century BCE, the name נא אמון No Amown occurs twice in reference to Thebes, by the KJV rendered just as No:
Jeremiah 46:25:25 The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, said: “Behold, I am bringing punishment upon Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh and Egypt and her gods and her kings, upon Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
English Standard Version:
Nahum 3:8 "Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?"
Ammon had a temple and a statue, the gift of Pindar (d. 443 BC), at Thebes, and another at Sparta, the inhabitants of which, as Pausanias says, consulted the oracle of Ammon in Libya from early times more than the other Greeks. At Aphytis, Chalcidice, Ammon was worshipped, from the time of Lysander (d. 395 BC), as zealously as in Ammonium. Pindar the poet honoured the god with a hymn. At Megalopolis the god was represented with the head of a ram (Paus. viii.32 § 1), and the Greeks of Cyrenaica dedicated at Delphi a chariot with a statue of Ammon.
Such was its reputation among the Classical Greeks that Alexander the Great journeyed there after the battle of Issus and during his occupation of Egypt, where he was declared "the son of Amun" by the oracle. Alexander thereafter considered himself divine. Even during this occupation, Amun, identified by these Greeks as a form of Zeus, continued to be the principal local deity of Thebes.
Alexander the Great - the God King 5/5
The Ptolemies
The Iranian empire conquered by Alexander was divided by his generals and Ptolemy took Egypt:
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was founded in 305 BC by Ptolemy I Soter, who declared himself Pharaoh of Egypt and created a powerful Hellenistic dynasty that ruled an area stretching from southern Syria to Cyrene and south to Nubia. Alexandria became the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions by marrying their siblings, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.
The Ptolemies
As Iranian conquerors extended the temples of the pharaohs and built their own in Egyptian style; so the Greeks did the same:



Under Ptolemaic rule, temples largely “continued to perform their ancient functions” as the Ptolemaic kings recognized the important role the temples played in the geopolitics of Egypt. The Ptolemies built many more temples and restored the ancient temples of the pharaohs before them. Over time, these temples and various buildings began to create a visual representation of the blending of the Greek and Egyptian cultures and peoples. The efforts of the Ptolemaic rulers to continue the tradition of the Late Period of Egypt and incorporate Greek’s own classical style led to more and more blending “so that works in a rather incongruous mixed style become more and more common.” Ultimately, the architecture of the Ptolemies has become often identified as simply Egyptian by the layperson.
Ptolemaic Egypt is “a tale of two cultures” being brought together by a Greek dynasty that used ruler-cults, religious cults, and temples as tools to legitimize their rule. As a consequence, the Egyptians became hellenized, and the Greeks became “Egyptianized.” Truly, the Ptolemaic dynasty represents a remarkable example of how religion was used as a political tool in the ancient world to justify the conquest and domination of a nation. (Ptolemy's Political Tool: Religion by Heather Wellendorf)

Roman world
The Romans, identifying themselves as common heirs to a very similar civilization, identified Greek deities with similar figures in the Etruscan-Roman tradition, though without usually copying cult practices. Syncretic gods of the Hellenistic period found also wide favor in Rome: Serapis, Isis and Mithras, for example. Cybele as worshipped in Rome essentially represented a syncretic East Mediterranean goddess. The Romans imported the Greek god Dionysus into Rome, where he merged with the Latin mead god Liber, and converted the Anatolian Sabazios into the Roman Sabazius.
The degree of correspondence varied: Jupiter makes perhaps a better match for Zeus than the rural huntress Diana does for the feared Artemis. Aresdoes not quite match Mars. The Romans physically imported the Anatolian goddess Cybele into Rome from her Anatolian cult-center Pessinos in the form of her original aniconic archaic stone idol; they identified her as Magna Mater and gave her a matronly, iconic image developed in Hellenistic Pergamum.



Likewise, when the Romans encountered Celts and Germanic peoples, they mingled these peoples' gods with their own, creating Sulis Minerva, Apollo Sucellos (Apollo the Good Smiter) and Mars Thingsus (Mars of the war-assembly), among many others. In the Germania, the Roman historian Tacitus speaks of Germanic worshippers of Hercules and Mercury; most modern scholars tentatively identify Hercules as Thor and Mercury as Odin.
Romans were familiar with the concept of syncretism because from their earliest times they had experienced it with, among others, the Greeks. The Romans incorporated the originally Greek Apollo and Hercules into their religion. They did not look at the religious aspects that they adopted from other cultures to be different or less meaningful from religious aspects that were Roman in origin. The early Roman acceptance of other cultures religions into their own made it easy for them to integrate the newly encountered religions they found as a result of their expansion.
Christianity
The Roman emperors used syncretism to help unite the expanding empire (Freke, The Jesus Mysteries). In the first few centuries after the death of Jesus, there were various "Jesus Movements", some competing with each other. There was no Christianity as we know it today (and the first use of the term in whatever language is undetermined).
This, then, is the consensus view on how cultural fusion works in Classical Antiquity and it supports the history offered here.

It's so easy to make us laugh at foreigners, especially those of different ethnicity and religion:
17 October 2014
UAE: Man divorces wife 'possessed by genie'
By News from Elsewhere......media reports from around the world, found by BBC Monitoring
A court in Dubai has granted a divorce to a man who says his wife is possessed by spirits and refuses to have sex with him, reports suggest.
After persistently denying him sex, the woman finally told her husband to discuss the issue with her parents, the Gulf News daily reports, without naming the couple.
They told the man that his wife was, in fact, possessed by a jinn, and that several religious scholars had unsuccessfully tried to exorcise the spirit, the paper says.
Who believes in Aladdin and his magic lamp, huh?
Christians have the same, basic belief, as we see in the name and its history:



Jinn or djinn (singular: jinnī, djinni, or genie; Arabic: الجن al-jinn, singular الجني al-jinnī) are supernatural creatures in Islamic mythology as well as pre-Islamic Arabian mythology. They are mentioned frequently in the Quran (the 72nd sura is titled Sūrat al-Jinn) and other Islamic texts and inhabit an unseen world in dimensions beyond the
visible universe of humans. The Quran says that thejinn are made of a smokeless and "scorching fire",
[1]
but are also physical in nature, being able to interfere physically with people and objects and likewise be acted upon. The jinn, humans and angelsmake up the three sapient creations of God. Like human beings, the jinn can be good, evil, or neutrally
benevolent and hence have free will like humans and unlike angels.
[2]
The shaytan jinn are the analogue of demons in Christian tradition, but the jinn are not angels and the Quran draws a clear distinction between the two creations. The word genie in English is derived from Latin genius, meaning a sort of tutelary or guardian spirit thought to be assigned to each person at birth.
And this "genius" is straight out of Greek religion, which we now term mythology, or philosophy:
The words "dæmon" and "daimōn" are Latinized versions of the Greek "δαίμων" ("godlike power, fate, god"), a reference to the daemons of ancient Greek religion and mythology, as well as later Hellenistic religion and philosophy. The comparable Roman concept is the genius who accompanies and protects a person or presides over a place (see genius loci).
And so we see the influence of imperial Rome, which is how this idea becomes Christian.
Catacombs of San Callisto: baptism in a 3rd-century painting
Christianity starts with baptism, which calls on the Lord to remove and replace a person's daemon, or spirit, with that of the divinity (rather like exorcism); it is how Christianity resurrects.
Genii, or spirit, it's all the same and it's all done by magic.

Cleopatra VII and Rome - Origins of Christianity
John Bartram, 26 Jun 2014, 11:01 ⋮ 20-25 minutes
The syncretisms between the faiths of ancient, pharaonic Egypt and the Ptolemaic dynasty come to a head with this woman - and then these unique characteristics pass on to Rome, to become the essential ingredients of the new empire:
Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a family of Greek origin that ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great's death during the Hellenistic period. The Ptolemies, throughout their dynasty, spoke Greek and refused to speak Egyptian, which is the reason that Greek as well as Egyptian languages were used on official court documents such as the Rosetta Stone. By contrast, Cleopatra did learn to speak Egyptian and represented herself as the reincarnation of an Egyptian goddess, Isis.
Understanding her opens the door to the origins of all the religions of the modern era, such is the impact she made on Julius Caesar and through him, their child and his adopted son; Mark Antony, his and their children; and the Greco-Roman world from India to the northern British Isles.
Cleopatra inherited a regal system designed to focus all power - military, financial and economic, religious and legal - on the monarch, these powers containing the whole wealth - in all its varied forms - of this great and ancient nation.
The rationale for such concentration of power, the actual mechanism which allowed it to function in this exclusive, monopolistic manner, had been invented by the pharaohs:
Pharaoh, meaning "Great House"...became the form of address for a person who was king and the son of the god Ra. "The Egyptian sun god Ra, considered the father of all pharaohs, was said to have created himself from a pyramid-shaped mound of earth before creating all other gods." (Donald B. Redford, Ph.D., Penn State)
Scepters and staves were a general sign of authority in Ancient Egypt. One of the earliest royal scepters was discovered in the tomb of Khasekhemwyin Abydos. Kings were also known to carry a staff, and



Pharaoh Anedjib is shown on stone vessels carrying a so-called mks-staff. The scepter with the longest history seems to be the heqa-scepter, sometimes described as the shepherd's crook.
...pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection.
At various times, certain gods became preeminent over the others, including the sun god Ra, the creator god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. For a brief period, in the aberrant theology promulgated by the Pharaoh Akhenaten, a single god, the Aten, replaced the traditional pantheon.
It seems most likely that the Egyptians viewed royal authority itself as a divine force.
The authority of the pharaoh came from the divine nature of the sun, and a divine trinity;
He therefore acted as intermediary between Egypt's people and the gods. He was key to upholding Ma'at, both by maintaining justice and harmony in human society and by sustaining the gods with temples and offerings. For these reasons, he oversaw all state religious activity.
The king was also associated with many specific deities. He was identified directly with Horus, who represented kingship itself, and he was seen as the son of Ra, who ruled and regulated nature as the Pharaoh ruled and regulated society. By the New Kingdom he was also associated with Amun, the supreme force in the cosmos. Upon his death, the king became fully deified. In this state, he was directly identified with Ra, and was also associated with Osiris, god of death and rebirth and the mythological father of Horus. Many mortuary temples were dedicated to the worship of deceased pharaohs as gods.
Cleopatra as the resurrected Isis:
The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris' murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris' wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of Isis and Osiris' union, who is first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus' triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris' resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder and, especially, death and the afterlife.
The role of the river Nile and the immersion of Osiris in its waters becomes central:
The Egyptians believed that written words had the power to affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris' death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered...they imply that Osiris' corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred.



In late September or early October 130, Hadrian and his entourage, among them Antinous, assembled at Heliopolis to set sail upstream as part of a flotilla along the River Nile. The retinue included officials, the Prefect, army and naval commanders, as well as literary and scholarly figures. Possibly also joining them was Lucius Ceionius Commodus, a young aristocrat whom Antinous might have deemed a rival to Hadrian's affections. On their journey up the Nile, they stopped at Hermopolis Magna, the primary shrine to the god Thoth. It was shortly after this, in October 130 – around the time of the festival of Osiris – that Antinous fell into the river and died, probably from drowning.
To avoid unnecessary doubt: Hadrian took Antinous to the same place on the river bank where tradition places the death of Osiris, and during the same period when Egyptians celebrated this event; after the drowning of Antinous, Hadrian, as Pontifex Maximus, then resurrected him using the same magic tools, and made him a god, building a city and very many temples in his name. Hadrian had written and illustrated his method on a great obelisk; it was taken from the Antinoeion Sanctuary at Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli in 1633 by Pope Urban VIII, who relocated it in his palace, then in 1822 Pope Pius VII moved the obelisk to the Piazzale del Pincio.
From the earliest pharaohs, through the Ptolemaic dynasty to Cleopatra, on to the Roman Empire and Chrestianity, then ultimately, Christianity, there is an unbroken lineage of resurrection, the theology of which is solar and magical, whose purpose is to place supreme authority in a single pair of hands. From the ankh to chi-rho and tau-rho to the crucifix, we see a syncretic mechanism to gain and justify absolute power through the ages.
How did this woman make such an impact? Regardless of her personal qualities - and nobody suggests she was a great orator, radical philosopher, unrivalled general, or queen of an empire - if she had limited herself to Egypt, then her ideas, her vision of herself, would have remained in the land of the pyramids. Her impact on the world was through others, specifically the two Romans with whom she contrived affairs.
Emperor's Cult (Royal Ontario Museum)
Rome produced many great generals, politicians, orators, poets and authors, all of whom made some impression on the world, but none can compare in their results with Julius Caesar: without him and his adopting Octavian, there would have been no empire. The Republic was already bigger than Rome, Italy even, by the time Caesar met Cleopatra; the empire, then, was more - much more - than territory; it was more than monarchy. The life of Julius Caesar led to the role of emperor and it contained its own cult, of divine dimensions:
The official offer of cultus to a living emperor acknowledged his office and rule as divinely approved and constitutional: his Principate should therefore demonstrate pious respect for traditional Republican deities and mores.
A deceased emperor held worthy of the honor could be voted a state divinity (divus, plural divi) by the Senate and elevated as such in an act of apotheosis. The granting of apotheosis served religious, political and moral judgment on Imperial rulers and allowed living Emperors to associate themselves with a well-regarded lineage of Imperial divi from which unpopular or unworthy predecessors were excluded. This
Emperor's Cult



proved a useful instrument to Vespasian in his establishment of the Flavian Imperial Dynasty following the death of Nero and civil war, and to Septimius in his consolidation of the Severan dynasty after the assassination of Commodus. In the development of Imperial rule from Principate to Dominate, the role of the Senate was increasingly marginalised and military loyalty became the key to Imperial authority.
It drew its power and effect, however, from both religious traditions deeply engrained in Roman culture, such as the veneration of the genius of each individual and of the ancestral dead, and on forms of the Hellenistic ruler cult developed in the eastern provinces of the Empire.

images of Alexander were worn as magic charms (4th-century Roman).
As Caesar stood, talked, ate and slept with Cleopatra, so he was made aware - by design if nothing else - that his partner was divine, a goddess. We know how impressed he was, for although he was already married, he took Cleopatra to Rome and displayed her to the public:
Cleopatra, Ptolemy XIV and Caesarion visited Rome in the summer of 46 BC. The Egyptian queen resided in one of Caesar's country houses. The relationship between Cleopatra and Caesar was obvious to the Roman people and it was a scandal because the Roman dictator was already married to Calpurnia Pisonis. But Caesar even erected a golden statue of Cleopatra represented as Isis in the temple of Venus Genetrix (the mythical ancestress of Caesar's family), which was situated at the Forum Julium.
Caesar was divine before his death:
Early in 44 BC, he was called parens patriae (father of the fatherland); legal oaths were taken by his Genius; his birthday was made a public festival; the month Quinctilis was renamed July, in his honor (as June was named for Juno). At last a special priest, a flamen, was ordained for him; the first was to be Marc Antony, Caesar's adjutant, then consul – an honor which once officially adopted would rank Caesar not only as divine, but as a divinity honoured equally with Quirinus, Jupiter, and Mars. In Cicero's hostile account, the living Caesar's honours in Rome were already and unambiguously those of a full-blown god (deus).
His name as a living divinity – not as yet ratified by senatorial vote – was Divus Julius (or perhaps Jupiter Julius); divus, at that time, was a slightly archaic form of deus, suitable for poetry, implying some association with the bright heavens.
The essential character of emperor was thus already in place during his and Cleopatra's lifetime - the motive force which propelled Ptolemaic syncretisms into modernity was underway.



Relief of Cleopatra VII and Caesarion at the temple of Dendera
Her relationship with Mark Antony confirmed this and important signals are to be found at Dendera and even in the manner of the death of her
Cleopatra: Portrait Of A Killer (BBC)
sister, Arsinoë:
Captive, Arsinoe was then transported to Rome, where in 46 BC she was forced to appear in Caesar's triumph. Despite the custom of strangling prominent prisoners in triumphs when the festivities were at an end, Caesar was pressured to spare Arsinoe and granted her sanctuary at the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. Arsinoe lived in the temple for a few years, always keeping a watchful eye on her sister Cleopatra, who perceived Arsinoe as a threat to her power. In 41 BC, at Cleopatra's instigation, Mark Antony ordered Arsinoë executed on the steps of the temple, a gross violation of the temple sanctuary and an act which scandalised Rome.
Cleopatra's son by Caesar, Caesarion, was proclaimed pharaoh by the Egyptians, after Alexandria fell to Octavian. Caesarion was captured and killed, his fate reportedly sealed when one of Octavian's advisers paraphrased Homer: "It is bad to have too many Caesars." This ended not just the Hellenistic line of Egyptian pharaohs, but the line of all Egyptian pharaohs. The three children of Cleopatra and Antony were spared and taken back to Rome where they were taken care of by Antony's wife, Octavia Minor. The daughter, Cleopatra Selene, was married through arrangements of Octavian to Juba II of Mauretania.
The worship of Isis spread throughout the Greco-Roman world:
The Temple of Isis is a Roman temple dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Isis. This small and almost intact temple was among one of the first discoveries during the excavation of Pompeii in 1764.



The preserved Pompeian temple is actually the second structure; the original building built under Augustan was damaged in an earlier earthquake of 62 AD. Seventeen years later with the massive volcanic eruption, the Iseum alone was the sole temple to be completely re-built—ahead even of the Capitolium.
Principal devotees of this temple are assumed to be women, freedmen, and slaves.
These would be same constituents as the purported, though unsupported Christian congregation.

The legacy of Cleopatra extended beyond her impact on Rome and even her family. Egypt had an established aristocracy, bureaucracy and merchant class - the intellectual and financial elite who managed the nation's productivity and trade by land and sea across the world. Egypt had vast economic resources, of farms, vinyards and wineries; stone quarries for alabaster, purple porphyry, celestine and quartzite and coloured granites; mines producing high-grade gold, beryl and emeralds, turquoise, amethyst, lapis lazuli and malachite.



She created the culture of Egypt in that period, which became a part of the Roman Empire. This included the religion, with its temples, priests and theology; the Royal Library (the world's largest with several hundred thousand volumes) and the Museum, a famous scholarly complex; its capital, Alexandria, was cosmopolitan and flourishing with craftsmen, merchants and a Jewish Quarter.
Rome did not abandon these institutions upon making Egypt a province; Egypt became the Roman 'bread basket'. To enter the Library now required a written pass from the emperor, who also made the leading appointments - some Roman and others local, including Greeks and Jews:
Alexander the Alabarch (c. 10 BCE – unknown CE) was an Alexandrian Jewish aristocrat. His brother was the exegete and philosopher Philo of Alexandria.
At some unknown date, Alexander was appointed Alabarch of Alexandria. The alabarch was a magistrate responsible for customs in Alexandria. ("Alabarch," Jewish Encyclopedia) Later Alexander became an administrator for the extensive land estates in Egypt, owned by Antonia Minor.
Alexander had two sons, Tiberius Julius Alexander and Marcus Julius Alexander. After 41 CE, Alexander and Agrippa I arranged for their children to be married. Alexander's second son Marcus Julius was wed to princess Berenice. (Antiquities 19.276-277) Marcus Julius died prematurely without producing any children with Berenice. (Evans, p. 581) Tiberius Julius was the Procurator of Judea from 46 to 48 and the Prefect of Egypt from 66 to 69. In 70, he participated in the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus' second-in-command.
In around 32-35 CE, the Herodian Agrippa I was indebted to Rome for 300,000 pieces of silver. (Evans, pp. 578-9) Agrippa escaped Judea and sailed to Alexandria to beg Alexander to loan him 200,000 drachmas. Alexander refused to give the money directly to Agrippa, but agreed to loan Agrippa's wife Cypros the money because Alexander "marvelled at her love of her husband and all her other good qualities." (Antiquities, 18.159-160)
Sometime between 37 and 41 CE, the Emperor Caligula ordered Alexander to be imprisoned in Rome for an unknown reason. This could be connected to Philo’s embassy to Caligula in Rome in 39/40. After the death of Caligula in 41, his paternal uncle Claudius became Emperor and he immediately released Alexander from prison. Josephus wrote that Alexander was "an old friend of [Claudius], who had acted as guardian for his mother Antonia." (Antiquities, 19.276)
(of the latter, Suetonius describes him as ‘despicable and dishonest’).

The Roman general Vespasian took as his second, common-law wife a freedwoman of Antonia Minor, Antonia Caenis, and it was due to the control of the Egyptian grain supply that ensured he became emperor:
In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt, the source of Rome's grain supply, and had not yet left for Rome.
According to Tacitus, his trip was delayed due to bad weather.[15] Modern historians theorize that Vespasian had been and was continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing.
[16]Stories of a divine Vespasian healing people circulated in Egypt.[17] During this period, protests erupted in Alexandria over his new tax policies and grain shipments were held up. Vespasian eventually restored
order and grain shipments to Rome resumed.[14]
This is how Chrestians consolidated their positions in both Egypt and the imperial Roman court. Over the next century, Chrestians appear on rich estates in Egypt as Herodians fled the the dangers of the Jewish-Roman wars, and used their cultic connections to advantage; this may well have led to the Second (Kitos) Jewish-Roman War.



Notes:
Alexander conquered Egypt in 332 BCE and the Ptolemies took over 27 years later. This tomb of Osiris may have been built only two centuries earlier; this complex been a part of the Osiris festivities at least until the Greek arrival.
Tomb of Osiris.docx
The principal temple to Osiris was at Abydos.
Temple of Osiris at Abydos
This temple was expanded just before Alexander's conquest and occupation:
Institute of Fine Arts excavations, supervised by Michelle Marlar, IFA PhD, now Adjunct Professor, University of Alabama, Huntsville, have revealed the remains of two superimposed architectural phases of a major temple building, very possibly the main temple of Osiris at Abydos. The much denuded later phase belongs to Egypt’s last native dynasty, the 30th, dating to the 4th Century BCE (Current IFA Projects at Abydos)
Archaeology and the Festival of Osiris
As the primary cult place of the god Osiris, ruler of the land of the dead and one of the most important and popular Egyptian deities, Abydos had a special importance in Egyptian religious belief and practice. A central component of the cult of Osiris was a great annual festival procession that followed a route from the god’s temple in the town, across the low desert landscape, to the site of the early royal tombs at Umm elQa’ab, where one of the tombs was interpreted to be that of the god, who, according to myth, had once been an earthly ruler of Egypt. A frequently expressed wish in religious texts from ancient Egypt is to be able to visit the site to witness this procession and benefit from its rituals. A pilgrimage to Abydos for just this purpose is frequently depicted in Egyptian funerary art.
This belief and this ritual continued throughout Greek rule, into the Roman imperial:
The festivals of Khoiak are among the best attested from ancient Egypt. They revolve around the myth of the god Osiris, murdered by his brother Seth, and revived by his sister-wife Isis to the point where she could conceive their son Horus. Osiris withdrew to rule the underworld, while Isis protected Horus until he was old enough to avenge his father in battle with Seth, and win the throne. The death and revival of Osiris provide the mythic echo of the annual rebirth of crops. In the ceremony, seeds were sown in earth, which was from the New Kingdom shaped in moulds to the form of Osiris; the sown earth was watered until the seeds germinated, and then this guarantor of a successful crop was buried. The timing of the festival in the official year placed it in the fourth month of flood, just as the waters receded to expose silt-covered fields fresh for sowing. The name of the festival was ka-her-ka 'ka upon ka' (or 'sustenance upon sustenance'); it survived into Christian times as the name of the fourth month of the season of flood, rendered in Coptic as Khoiak.

Bishop Abercius Marcellus - Origins of Christianity
John Bartram, 3 Jul 2014, 22:03 ⋮ 24-30 minutes
His hagiography (by Symeon the Metaphrast) in the Middle Ages made him well-known and popular; the archaeological discovery of his epitaph in Phrygia by Sir William Ramsay in the late 19th century has brought him much scholarly attention. This text is full of syncretic allusions commonly accepted as Christian, through some consider them pagan. Described in the textual tradition as opposing Montanism - actually Chrestianity - he is an example of a Chrestian bishop and his epitaph is thus a means of informing us of what this was in the second century, once the Herodian thug Saul had become the divine man Paul of Tarsus.
He is said to have evangelized Syria and Mesopotamia, and is on that basis referred to as one of the Equals-to-the-Apostles. He was imprisoned under Marcus Aurelius, and died about 167.
Several works are ascribed to him:
1. An Epistle to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, of which Baronius speaks as extant, but he does not produce it
2. A Book of Discipline (Greek Βίβλος διδασκαλίας) addressed to his clergy; this too is lost.[2]
With the time and place established, let us consider what Chrestianity was and was not in the life of Abercius.
This is the cult founded by Saul, the Herodian thug as described by Josephus, whose forebear was General Costobarus, hereditary priest of the temple of Kos, which had become Hellenised as a solar divinity, and the general's wife was Salome, sister of Herod I the Great. We learn from the epistles and Josephus how his congregation was the provincial elite with connections to the imperial court (Poppaea Sabina and Epaphroditus, and through them to freedman Felix, procurator of Judea 52-58, and Vespasian and his son Felix). His theology is designed to appeal to the Hellenised elite of the region (as we see in Adiabene), promoting the Jewish Patriarchs but not Jewish Law. The proto-gospels such as we see in Dura fragment 24 (dated to the early 3rd century) have not yet appeared (by 167), as far as we know. The divine man of this cult is Paul of Tarsus and "IS" - known today as Jesus - may not have appeared, yet alone been adopted by Chrestianity. It is centred on the Chi-Rho and thus, magical resurrection through baptism, possibly riverine as in Egypt. This related Chrestianity closely with the Isis cult. Saul and his cult is connected to Alexandria through Alexander the Alabarch, his brother Philo, and Alexanders two sons, Marcus who married the Herodian princess Berenice, and Tiberius Julius, who became a Jew-hating best friend of Titus. One must remember too that General Costabarus, in the treason that brought his downfall, was an agent for Cleopatra VII. Hellenism across the civilised world, from India to Egypt, allowed this new cult to syncretically incorporate elements from many sources. The magic was from pharaonic Egypt, Chaldea (Mesopotamia) and Pythagoreanism; there was the pharaohs crosier, the title episkopos/bishops came from the Persian court ("King's Eye") via Philip II of Macedonia; the trinity was Egyptian, though common elsewhere. Other cults also worshipped the Patriarchs. These syncretisms were appearing in numerous cults. Explicitly Chrestian archaeology is soon to be produced in Phrygia, so we know the cult is about to flourish. This cult is quite open, not at all covert, so it is neither hidden, nor illegal, but imperially-sponsored. The relationship of Marcion of Sinope to Pauline literature, and the finding of a Marcionite 'synagogue' near Damascus dated securely to the early-4th century, suggests that Marcion was to become the leader of Chrestianity. By then, it had spread across the Levant.
The epitaph:



I, the citizen of a distinguished city, have made this
while still living so that I might have at the appropriate
time a place here for my body.
My name is Abercius, disciple of the holy shepherd
who feeds his flocks on mountains and plains,
who has great eyes that look into everything.
For he taught me the Faithful scriptures of life.
He sent me to Rome to make articulate the kingdom and
to see a queen with a golden robe and golden sandals.
And there I saw a people with a splendid seal.
And I saw the plain of Syria and passed through all the cities,
having crossed the Euphrates. Everywhere I had companions
Paul . . . and faith was everywhere my guide and
everywhere she laid before me food, fish from a fountain
the very great, the pure, which a holy virgin seized,
and she gave this to friends to eat forever,
having a goodly wine, giving it mixed with water, with
These things I, Abercius, dictated to be inscribed here
Truly I was seventy-two years old.
Let everyone in harmony who understands this pray for Abercius.
Do not, however, let anyone place another in my tomb;
otherwise he shall pay to the Roman treasury two thou
and to my goodly fatherland, Hieropolis, one thousand
In keeping with the Discipline of the Secret, the Epitaph of Abercius is crowded with information on matters of faith and religious practice enshrined in mystical and symbolical terms that were readily understood by the baptized, but remained unintelligible to the average pagan reader.
(Eucharistic Belief Manifest in the Epitaphs of Abercius and Pectorius, taken from the October 1954 issue of "The American Ecclesiastical Review."
This Discipline of the Secret is a good indicator as it is hardly likely to be Christian:



Disciplina arcani (Latin for "Discipline of the Secret" or "Discipline of the Arcane") is the custom that prevailed in Early Christianity, whereby knowledge of the more intimate mysteries of the Christian religion was carefully kept from non-Christians and even from those who were undergoing instruction in the faith.
This is typically Greco-Roman for this period:
Mystery religions, sacred mysteries or simply mysteries, were religious schools of the Greco-Roman world for which participation was reserved to initiates (mystai). The main characterization of this religion is the secrecy associated with the particulars of the initiation and the ritual practice, which may not be revealed to outsiders. The most famous mysteries of Greco-Roman antiquity were the Eleusinian Mysteries, which were of considerable antiquity and predated the Greek Dark Ages.
The Roman Senate sought to ban Dionysian rites throughout the Empire, restricting their gatherings to a handful of people under special license in Rome. However, this only succeeded in pushing the cult underground. They gained further notoriety due to claims that the wife of Spartacus (leader of the Slave Revolt of 73BC) was an initiate of the Thracian Mysteries of Dionysus and considered her husband an incarnation of Dionysus Liber. The Mysteries were revived in a tamer form under Julius Caesar around 50 BC, with his onetime ally Mark Antony becoming an enthusiastic devotee and obtaining popular support. They remained in existence (along with their carnivalesque Bacchanalian street processions) until at least the time of Augustine (A.D. 354–430) and were an institution in most Romanised provinces.
The claim within the textual tradition for Christianity being forced into hiding and secrecy in likely to be a poor reflection of the mystic character of Chrestanity and its congregation. Some of the Pauline epistles may well be largely historical, while some, scholars admit, are more obviously late; even so, they reveal a different faith to that of the synoptics, one of a mystery religion:
In his letters, Paul also focuses on mental activities, but not in the same way as the Synoptics, which equate renewing the mind with repentance. Instead, Paul sees the renewal of our minds as happening as we contemplate what Jesus did on the Cross, which then opens us to grace and to the movement of the Holy Spirit into our hearts. Like John, Paul is less interested in knowledge, preferring to emphasize the hiddenness, the "mystery" of God's plan as revealed through Christ. But Paul's discussion of the Cross differs from John's in being less about how it reveals God's glory and more about how it becomes the stumbling block that turns our minds back to God. Paul also describes the Christian life as that of an athlete, demanding practice and training for the sake of the prize; later writers will see in this image a call to ascetical practices.
The syncretisms
In 1894 G. Ficker, supported by O. Hirschfeld, strove to prove that Abercius was a priest of the morther goddess Cybele. In 1895 A. Harnack offered an explanation which was sufficiently obscure, making Abercius the representative of an ill-defined religious syncretism arbitrarily combined in such a fashion as to explain all portions of the inscription which were otherwise inexplicable. In 1896, Dieterich made Abercius a priest of Attis.
These pagan hypotheses are partly correct, for Chrestianity is a pagan and synretic faith, and thus Christian scholars are also correct in pointing out that they are flawed, but they then fail to correctly identify the faith of Abercius, who can be Christian only by looking backwards and superimposing Christianity upon the older faith. We must do the opposite.
1. The holy shepherd.
The shepherd motif goes back to Ancient Egypt and the shepherd's crook derived from the iconography of Andjety, who was the local god of the Delta town named Djedu. He was represented in human form with two feathers on his head and holding the crook and flail in his hands At a very early date in Egyptian history, Andjety, who had a close relationship with kingship from the earliest of times, was absorbed into Osiris of Busiris, who became a national god known simply as Osiris.
The crook was a sceptre in the shape of a shepherd's crook. Its name is related to the verb HqA, to rule, the substantives HqA and HqA.t, ruler, and the divine epithet HqA used in connection with Osiris.
The Good Shepherd motif:
In ancient Greek cult, kriophoros (Greek: κριοφόρος) or criophorus, the "ram-bearer," is a figure that commemorates the solemn sacrifice of a ram. It becomes an epithet of Hermes: Hermes Kriophoros.



Not all ancient Greek sculptures of sacrifiants with an offering on their shoulders bear young rams. The nearly lifesizemarble Calfbearer (moschophoros), of ca 570 BCE, found on the Athenian Acropolis in 1864 (illustration, left) is inscribed "Rhombos", apparently the donor, who commemorated his sacrifice in this manner. The sacrificial animal in the case is a young bull, but the iconic pose, with the young animal across the sacrifiant's shoulders, secured by fore legs and rear legs firmly in the sacrifiant's grip, is the same as many kriophoroi. This is the most famous of the Kriophoros sculptures and is exhibited at the Acropolis Museum
Lewis R. Farnell placed this Hermes Kriophoros foremost in Arcadia:
"As Arcadia has been from time immemorial the great pasture-ground of Greece, so probably the most primitive character in which Hermes appeared, and which he never abandoned, was the pastoral. He is the lord of the herds,epimélios and kriophoros, who leads them to the sweet waters, and bears the tired ram or lamb on his shoulders, and assists them with the shepherd's crook, the kerykeion."
The Kriophoros figure of a shepherd carrying a lamb, simply as a pastoral vignette, became a common figure in series denoting the months or seasons, characteristically March or April.
The shepherd's crook becomes the bishop's crosier and the Good Shepherd is, of course, the religious leader who, in return for guarding his flock from outsiders, fleeces the sheep as required.
2. The queen in Rome with the golden sandals and robe
This is not a person, but the institution of the Roman Church. Far from being the home of The Poor, its presence in Rome and the gold tell us something very important: it is not covert, illegal, hidden, as the textual tradition claims for itself; quite of opposite: it is headquartered in the heart of the empire, in the capital itself. This should have always been obvious to all, for this is the only way such a widespread movement could be managed; it has a structure, an organisation, with officers, monasteries, publications and congregations.
The gold of the golden sandals and golden robe also hints at great wealth, such as we see even today, with the Roman Church owning billions, with an aristocratic hierarchy, and officers living in palaces, driven in chauffeured limousines. Look at their vestments, in imperial purple and gold - they are resplendent, not at all The Poor.
The Roman Church is a descendant of the Pharaohs, Ptolemaic kings and Roman emperors, with all their secular power, money and divine authority.
3. people with a splendid seal
This, everyone agrees, is the (metaphorical and metaphysical) mark of baptism. Baptism began as the riverine Osiris resurrection ritual, which was celebrated symbolically every year in Egypt and copied by Hadrian with Antinous; it is also a parody of the ritual cleansing practised in Judaism, none so fanatically or famously as those Messianic Jews at Qumran.
Most of the archaeology we have today for Chrestianity is associated with baptism, much of it marked with the Ptolemaic Chi-Rho.
4. Paul
This is a direct reference to the divine man Paul of Tarsus, the chrestic incarnation of the Herodian thug Saul, kinsman of Costobarus and thus descendant of General Costobarus and Salome, sister of Herod I, the Great. The males of this family were the hereditary high priests of the temple to Kos.
The textual tradition - including the sacred texts - describe in detail how Saul used his missionary work as cover to recruit his own followers; from the Dead Sea Scrolls, where he is called "The Spouter of Lies", we also learn more how he did this. He is almost certainly one of the two missionaries to Adiabene, arguing how circumcision was not needed to convert to Judaism.
This verse is missing a word or two, which has created problems for translators and interpreters. Specifically, the wording is missing a crucial copulative object describing what capacity Paul serves with respect to Abercius. It can be argued how the sense seems best suited to possessing the power or spirit of Paul working through Abercius - perhaps through his hands as a healer. This would suit well the understanding of Chrestianity in this period being run by and for a collection of self-employed mystics, gaining money as they could through such activities as exorcism, fortune-telling (as seen in the Chrest Magus bowl) and faith-healing, much like Simon Magus (probably a pseudonym of Saul/Paul).
5. fish from a fountain



The sacred texts make much of fish. The four fishermen apostles of Galilee are 'fishers of men' rather than fish. Their nets are the "nets of Belial:
Also in The Dead Sea Scrolls is a recounting of a dream of Amram, the father of Moses, who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him. One is Belial who is described as the King of Evil and Prince of Darkness. Belial is also mentioned in the Fragments of a Zadokite Work (which is also known as The Damascus Document (CD)), which states that during the eschatological age, "Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through Isaiah the prophet." The Fragments also speak of "three nets of Belial" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary. In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel, as Mastema is. It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The Fragments also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a necromancer and wizard.
No doubt you can see how the New Testament works this as parody.
Şanlıurfa/ancient Edessa: according to tradition, Nimrod had Abraham immolated on a funeral pyre,
but God turned the fire into water and the burning coals into fish. The pool of sacred fish remains to this day.
6. a holy virgin seized, and she gave this to friends to eat forever, having a goodly wine, giving it mixed with water, with bread.
The consensus is that is is the Eucharist:
The fish was the symbol of Christ and of the eucharistic banquet: Christ is the "'ichthus' of exceeding great size and pure whom the spotless virgin brought forth from a spring" (v. 14). The faithful on their part are, in the language of Tertullian, "little fishes": "Nos pisciculi secundum 'ichthun' nostrum Jesum Christum in aqua nascimur." The spotless Virgin who caught the Fish from the spring is, according to the symbolism of the time, the Virgin Mary who conceived the Savior. The eucharistic food, then, is Christ Himself, the great and pure 'ICHTHUS': which is given only to the initiated and is administered under both species of bread and wine-the Body and Blood of Our Savior: "administering the mixed drink with bread" (v. 16). The "mixed drink" (Gr.: 'kerhasma') doubtless refers to the cup of wine mixed (tempered) with water; together with bread it constitutes the eucharistic <oblata.>
7. my goodly fatherland, Hieropolis
The New Testament is a textual artefact of the 4th century:
The Greek noun εὐχαριστία (eucharistia), meaning "thanksgiving", is not used in the New Testament as a name for the rite, however, the related verb is found in New Testament accounts of the Last Supper, including the earliest such account:
For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me". (1 Corinthians 11:23-24)
Early Christian sources
The Didache (Greek: teaching) is an early Church treatise that includes instructions for Baptism and the Eucharist. Most scholars date it to the early 2nd century, and distinguish in it two separate Eucharistic traditions, the earlier tradition in chapter 10 and the later one preceding it in chapter 9.
The oldest version we have of this was discovered in 1873, dated to 1056 CE precisely.
The historical origins of the feast are much older, older even than Christianity:
Agape feast



The expression The Lord's Supper, derived from St. Paul's usage in 1 Cor. 11:17-34 may have originally referred to the Agape feast (or love feast), the shared communal meal with which the Eucharist was originally associated.The Agape feast is mentioned in Jude 12. But The Lord's Supper is now commonly used in reference to a celebration involving no food other than the sacramental bread and wine.
Fresco of an Agape feast from a catacomb. There are many such.
These feasts were banned by the Roman Church because they were orgies of excessive food, drink and drugs, in which 'Love' was understood as 'free love' - sex. They have an older origin still:
The Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus, based on various ecstatic elements of the Greek Dionysia. They seem to have been popular, and well-organised, throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula. They were almost certainly associated with Rome's native cult of Liber, and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC but like all mystery religions of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites.
Bacchus on a Lion and Silenos on a Camel - Roman Mosaic
Legislation of 186, known as the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus, brought the Bacchanalia under control of the senate, and thus of the Roman pontifices. The existing cult chapters and colleges were dismantled. Congregations of mixed gender were permitted, but were limited to no more than two men and three women, and any Bacchanalia gathering must seek prior permission from the Senate. Men were forbidden Bacchus' priesthood.
The parallels with the worship of Dionysus have long been obvious to numerous scholars:
The earliest discussions of mythological parallels between Dionysus and the figure of the Christ in Christian theology can be traced to Friedrich Hölderlin, whose identification of Dionysus with Christ is most explicit in Brod und Wein (1800–1801) and Der Einzige (1801–1803).
Modern scholars such as Martin Hengel, Barry Powell, Robert M. Price, and Peter Wick, among others, argue that Dionysian religion and Christianity have notable parallels. They point to the symbolism of wine and the importance it held in the mythology surrounding both Dionysus and Jesus Christ; though, Wick argues that the use of wine symbolism in the Gospel of John, including the story of the Marriage at Cana at which Jesus turns water into wine, was intended to show Jesus as superior to Dionysus.



Birth of Dionysus, on a small sarcophagus that may have been made for a child (Walters Art Museum)
Scholars of comparative mythology identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-returning god mythological archetype. Other elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels. Powell, in particular, argues precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.
Another parallel can be seen in The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate.
Related, on March 28 was held the Initium Caiani, sometimes interpreted as initiations into the mysteries of the Magna Mater and Attis at the Gaianum, near the Phrygianum sanctuary at the Vatican Hill.
From at least 139 CE, Rome's port at Ostia, the site of the goddess's arrival, had a fully developed sanctuary to Magna Mater and Attis, served by a local Archigallus and college of dendrophores (the ritual tree-bearers of "Holy Week").
The Vatican Phrygianum, a pagan shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele (the Great Mother)
Various inscriptions from the end of the 4th century consist of dedications to Cybele by the last holdouts of the pagan aristocracy, suggesting that perhaps the temple was still in use in this period, and recording that the ritual of the taurobolium – being bathed in bulls’ blood – was taking place here. Perhaps this is where Abercius went to see his "queen".
Ground preparations for the building of St Peters' basilica on the Vatican Hill uncovered a shrine, known as the Phrygianum, with some 24 dedications to Magna Mater and Attis. Many are now lost, but most that survive were dedicated by high-status Romans after a taurobolium sacrifice to Magna Mater. None of these dedicants were priests of the Magna Mater or Attis, and several held priesthoods of one or more different cults.



Lastly, as concerns the epitaph: pay to the Roman treasury two thousand pieces of gold, and to my goodly fatherland, Hieropolis, one thousand pieces of gold.
This is an extraordinarily-large amount of money in any period of time, not fitting well with a bishop of The Poor, but better with a cult for the imperial elite.

Summary
Why should Abercius be Chrestian, when the consensus says Christian? And if not Christian, why not one of the other Phrygian cults?
We saw how the decision to label him Christian is loosely based: the epitaph alludes to things such as baptism, a virgin and a feast which became Christian, so he probably is. There is nothing definite, even if one believes the textual tradition placing Christianity in this period.
But the fact is, there is no Christianity in the second century; Abercius cannot be a Christian. If there was anything certain in the epitaph to make him Christian, there would be no discussion.
Our starting point therefore is this: the faith of Abercius has similarities to Christianity, centuries before that religion came into being; his divine man is Paul and there is no mention of Jesus (or "IS"); the mark of this faith is baptism.
Phrygia produces a number of faiths, notably that of Cybele and - as we see in the Tembris Valley - Chrestianity. Both are Hellenised and thus we must expect both to have remarkable similarities. There is also - from Egypt - the Hellenised worship of Isis. Syncrertism is fusing the whole lot ever-closer together. There is another, important theological point: the sun.
Left: Zeus Ammon. Roman copy of a Greek original from the late 5th century BCE. The Greeks of the lower Nile Delta and Cyrenaica combined features of supreme god Zeus with features of the Egyptian god Ammon-Ra. Staatliche Antikensammlungen Munich.
The Greeks had Helios, the Egyptians had Zeus-Ammon, the Romans had Sol; and in the Levant, Baal (and Kos) had become solar. Everyone agreed how the sun was central to their magic.Hadrian demonstrated his divine authority to Rome by standing in the Pantheon on the Spring Equinox so the suns rays shone through the oculus onto him.
Shortly after Abercius, the Severans came to power and married into the hereditary priesthood on the solar Baal in Emesa (Homs in Syria). They would take the holy stone to Rome and declare a new solar theology for the empire.



Right: Roman aureus depicting Elagabalus. The reverse reads Sanct Deo Soli Elagabal (To the Holy Sun God Elagabal), and depicts a four-horse, gold chariot carrying the holy stone of the Emesa temple.
Abercius was Chrestian because no other faith had Paul and baptism, but it would not look anything like Christianity as we know it, despite some similarities. Rather, Chrestianity in this period would look like the numerous other Hellenised, solar faiths using magic and with a divine man to call upon. That's how syncretism worked then.

Evidence-based history
The orthodox history of this period is backward looking, interpreting selective data through the beliefs of later times. With reliable dating to establish a secure chronology, the perspective offered here does the opposite, following the development of ideas through the archaeological record of successive generations.
We approach the information tabula rasa, in a scientific manner, with no prior judgements or biases. The archaeological record is allowed to speak for itself as much as possible. Similarly, expert opinion is often quoted where appropriate, linked to the source.
The introduction provides a brief summary, based on our reading of the evidences. Excavations are on-going, new artefacts (including texts) come to light and as we gain both new technologies and better methods, so we should expect more. Though much evidence has been destroyed over the centuries, there is good reason to be optimistic for better, more complete interpretation in future.

From the Book of the Dead to Gnosticism

The vignette at the top illustrates, from left to right, the god Heh as a representation of the Sea; a gateway to the realm of Osiris; the Eye of Horus; the celestial cow Mehet-Weret; and a human head rising from a coffin, guarded by the four Sons of Horus.[12]
12. Taylor 2010, p.51
How does the faith of Cleopatra VII - the ultimate expression of Ptolemaic syncretisms with pharaonic Egypt - lead to those of later Egypt, when it was a province of the Roman Empire? In particular, does it lead to the gnostic faiths of Hermeticism and Gnosticism (and in the East, Manichaeism)? That is what I am now trying to learn.
If I can learn those answers, I hope to better understand Chrestianity, as it also emerged from the same, Ptolemaic syncretisms, in the same time and place.
This will also help to better define the chronology, the gap between Cleopatra VII and when Christianity first appears. Gnosticism appears long before Christianity, but is contemporary with many faiths, including Chrestianity.
In Late Antiquity, Hermetism[19] emerged in parallel with early Christianity, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, the Chaldaean Oracles, and late Orphic and Pythagorean literature. These doctrines were "characterized by a resistance to the dominance of either pure rationality or
doctrinal faith."[20]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism
Well, in the above quotation, I would change 'Christianity' to read 'Chrestianity'. Syncretism makes these faiths - a whole lot of them - virtually indistinguishable.
The Hermetic literature added to the Egyptian concerns with conjuring spirits and animating statues that inform the oldest texts, Hellenistic writings of Greco-Babylonian astrology and the newly developed practice of alchemy (Fowden 1993: pp65–68). In a parallel tradition, Hermetic philosophy rationalized and systematized religious cult practices and offered the adept a method of personal ascension from the constraints of physical being, which has led to confusion of Hermeticism with Gnosticism,
which was developing contemporaneously.[10]
Dan Merkur, Stages of Ascension in Hermetic Rebirth.

One of the characteristics of Gnosticism is the plethora of gods, divinities, both as part of its theology and to be called upon to perform magic. Are these drawn upon the gods of the Book of the Dead?

The path to the afterlife as laid out in the Book of the Dead was a difficult one. The deceased was required to pass a series of gates, caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures. These terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and are illustrated in grotesque forms, typically as human figures with the heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts. Their names—for instance, "He who lives on snakes" or "He who dances in blood"—are equally grotesque. These creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the Book of the Dead; once pacified they posed no further threat, and could even extend their protection to the dead person. Another breed of supernatural creatures was 'slaughterers' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of Osiris; the Book of the Dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions. As well as these supernatural entities, there were also threats from natural or supernatural animals, including crocodiles, snakes, and beetles.
Then there is this term, Ennead:
The Book of the Dead: Afterlife
The deceased person is shown encountering the Great Ennead, a group of gods, as well as his or her own parents. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead
The Ennead (Ancient Greek: ἐννεάς, meaning a collection of nine things) was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology. The Ennead were worshipped at Heliopolis and consisted of the god Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set and Nephthys.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennead
The Six Enneads, sometimes abbreviated to The Enneads or Enneads (Greek: Ἐννεάδες), is the collection of writings of Plotinus, edited and compiled by his student Porphyry (c. 270 AD). Plotinus was a student of Ammonius Saccas and they were founders of Neoplatonism.
I am reasonably sure that this all relates to Chrestianity. The Six Enneads, for example, contain much about The Good, which perhaps is associated with Chrest, if we understand this term to mean Good: The Good; a state of Good; the Good of Life; the Supreme Good; The nature of Good; the Authentic Good; the Supreme, which within Itself is the Good but manifests Itself within the human being after this other mode; and more.
I know next to nothing of these things, so unless an expert appears from somewhere to help, I have some work to do.

A chronology of Chrest-Chrestian-Christ - Origins of Christianity
4-5 minutes
Corpus inscriptionum graecarum, Vol. 2
Note: The term Epekoos can be understood here as 'attentive', as in 'the one who listens'.
Due to the immense and valuable work of the author known as Acharya S/D.M. Murdock, thinking on the usage and meanings of the term Chreste has advanced considerably. I have recently joined her in open discussion on this, here. She also has this very informative page: Isis the Chrēst
We all know that Chrest is often meant as 'Good', or something useful; but it became associated in sacred texts with the Chi-Rho, itself derivative of the Ankh and thus Ancient Egyptian, magical resurrection; Chrest appears in the New Testament as a title for IS, known later as Jesus, and then is altered to read Christ, understood as messiah.
This history of development needs, I suggest, a chronology, so we can begin to understand who did what, when, and what the term meant to them at that particular time. Here is my first attempt:
Isis (and both Osiris and Horus) in pharaonic, Ancient Egypt; also the Isis Myth of death and resurrection from the Nile. Chrest - in normal usage, something good, useful. Chi-Rho used by Ptolemy III (246–222 BCE). Isis Chreste - appearing in Ptolemaic Egypt. Cleopatra VII (69 - 30 BCE) as Nea, the 'new Isis'. Chrest Magus bowl, late-1st century BCE - early-1st century CE. Chrestians - Roman inscription with Antonia Minor, Drusus and Jucundus. 'IS Chrest' in early Chrestian and Manichaean texts. 'IS Chrest' in Marcionite synagogue, Syria 318/9 CE 'IS Chrest' in the original New Testament (4th century) Chi-Rho adopted overtly by Constantine I. 'IS Chrest' altered to read Jesus Christ
We thus see a number of changes, most notably: Chrest becomes associated with killing, then (originally, riverine) resurrection.
I therefore think we must associate this Egyptian killing, followed by riverine resurrection, with baptism, starting with (i) the drowning and resurrection of Antinous by Hadrian (130 CE), then (ii) the accounts of John the Baptiser.
Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that was called the Baptist... (Antiquities of the Jews (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by Flavius Josephus (37–100))



The river god watches John baptising: the dove places the divine spirit into the young man to make him divine - IS Chrest.
And then, in the gospels:
John the baptiser appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. (Mark)
[We've discussed previously and in the main site what name the IS may represent: James, Izas, Josephus, Julius Caesar; now we may add Isis.]
I suggest that, putting Christianity aside for a moment, the two biggest, most important changes to the meaning of Chrest are:
Resurrection As a title for a divine man, walking the Earth (and who is killed, then resurrected).
Cleopatra as Isis. Dendera.
The last change is, I think, revolutionary. Nobody imagined Isis, or Isis Chreste as a person walking the Earth, yet somebody did imagine the character IS Chrest, later to become Jesus Christ. That is remarkable and this has to begin with Cleopatra VII, who did actually exist and claimed to be Isis resurrected.



Resurrection began with a god - not a real person actually living, dying and coming back to life; even Antinous came back only in stone; then some bright spark - Bardaisan I think - had this great idea to make this divinity a real person, like Antinous, but further - coming back to life as a real person. Hence, the gospels.
Resurrection for everyone else retained its original idea: like exorcism, magical invocation of the divinity was used to replace a person's daemon, spirit, soul, with that of the divinity. This was and still is baptism. This how Chrestians built so many baptisteries and how from Constantine I onwards, we see the Chi-Rho appearing on artefacts of baptism.

The Christian Conspiracy - Origins of Christianity

Artist's reconstruction of the buildings in the Plan by J. Rudolf Rahn, 1876.
The Plan of Saint Gall is a famous medieval architectural drawing of a monastic compound dating from
the early 9th century. It is preserved in the Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen, Ms 1092.
It is the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between the fall of
the Roman Empire and the 13th century.
As I could present an endless list of artefacts which either are both magical and supposedly Christian, or
texts which do not contain Jesus Christ, but Chrest and/or nomina sacra, the process would be a waste
of time - yours and mine.



Look, here are two rules: all early artefacts claimed as Christian are not - they do not mention Jesus
Christ, or Christianity; they are all (including those of the New Testament) magical.
The Roman Catholic Church maintains that the legitimate use of sacramentals in its proper
disposition is only encouraged by a firm faith and devotion in God, not through any magical
or superstitious belief bestowed on the sacramental. In this regard, rosaries, scapular,
medals and other devotional religious Catholic paraphernalia derive their power, not from
the symbolism created by the object, rather by the faith of the believer in entrusting its
power to God. While some Catholics may not fully appreciate this view, belief
in pagan magic or polytheistic superstition through material in-animate objects are
condemned by the Holy See.
Protestant denominations in general do not share in this belief, but
other Christian Evangelicals sometimes advertise in television prayer clothes, or coins, and
wallet reminders claiming to have intercessory powers on its bearer.[citation needed]Lay
Catholics are not permitted to perform solemn exorcisms but they can use holy water,
blessed salt and other sacramentals such as the Saint Benedict medal or the crucifix for
warding off evil.



The crucifix is one of the key sacramentals used by Catholics and has been used to ward
off evil for centuries. The imperial cross of Conrad II (1024–1039) referred to the power of
the cross against evil. Many of the early theologians of the Catholic Church made reference
to use of the sign of the cross by Christians to bless and to ward off demonic influences.
The crucifix is still widely used as a talismanic sacramental by Christians. One should be
wary of how the crucifix is attached to as jewelries such as pendants, bracelets and
necklace where it is attached to. If the cross is attached in such a way that it can be turned
upside down then it attracts evil and bad luck when worn for long periods of time.
And so on, and on. Look at the early catacombs and you will see the magic, with Jesus and his magic
wand performing his 'miracles'. Where did it come from? The Pythagorean mysteries, which
became NeoPlatonism, Gnosticism and Manichaeism; read the Greek Magical Papyri. These
'philosophers' are nothing of the sort, they are magicians. Some examples:
1. Iamblichus, also known as Iamblichus Chalcidensis, or Iamblichus of
Apamea (Greek: Ἰάμβλιχος, probably from Syriac or Aramaic ya-mlku, "He is king"; c. 245
c. 325 AD), was a Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher who determined the direction taken by
later Neoplatonic philosophy.Iamblichus was the chief representative
of Syrian Neoplatonism, though his influence spread over much of the ancient world. The
events of his life and his religious beliefs are not entirely known, but the main tenets of his
beliefs can be worked out from his extant writings. According to the Suda, and his
biographer Eunapius, he was born at Chalcis (modern Qinnasrin) in Syria. He was the son
of a rich and illustrious family, and he is said to have been the descendant of several
priest-kings of the Royal family of Emesa. Despite the complexities of the make-up of the
divine cosmos, Iamblichus still had salvation as his final goal. The embodied soul was to
return to divinity by performing certain rites, or theurgy, literally, 'divine-working'. Some
translate this as "magic", but the modern connotations of the term do not exactly match
what Iamblichus had in mind, which is more along the lines of a sacramental religious ritual.
Still, these acts did involve some of what would today be perceived as attempts at
'magic'.
2. Porphyry of Tyre (Greek: Πορφύριος, Porphyrios; c. 234 – c. 305 AD) was
a Neoplatonic philosopher who was born in Tyre.Porphyry also wrote widely on astrology,
religion, philosophy, and musical theory.
3. Plotinus (Greek: Πλωτῖνος; c. 204/5 – 270) was a major philosopher of the ancient world.
In his philosophy there are three principles: the One, the Intellect, and the Soul. His teacher
was Ammonius Saccasand he is of the Platonic tradition.[2] Historians of the 19th century



invented the term Neoplatonism and applied it to him and his philosophy which was
influential in Late Antiquity.After spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then
decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the Persian
philosophers and the Indian philosophers.
Plotinus' philosophy had a great influence on the development of Christian theology.
And what are the Church Fathers when they began their careers? They are 'philosophers', inhabiting the
imperial court; we have only the false, textual tradition to tell us that these magicians became Christian.
Chrestos in opening of Mani epistle - Kellis, Egypt
The artefacts of Greek Magic, Manichaeism and other Gnostic faiths, magicians called philosophers,
Chrestianity: this is what you find well into the medieval period period, before Christianity surfaces.
Logos
The term "Logos" was interpreted variously in neoplatonism. Plotinus refers to Thales in
interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, the interrelationship between
the Hypostases (Soul, Spirit (nous) and the 'One'). St. John introduces a relation between
'Logos' and the Son, Christ, whereas, St. Paul calls it 'Son', 'Image', and
'Form'. Victorinus subsequently differentiated the Logos interior to God from the Logos
related to the world by creation and salvation.
Early Christian and Medieval Neoplatonism
Certain central tenets of Neoplatonism served as a philosophical interim for
the Christian theologian Augustine of Hippo on his journey from dualistic Manichaeism to
Christianity.Many other Christians were influenced by Neoplatonism, especially in their
identifying the Neoplatonic One, or God, with Jehovah."For Moslems, Plato, Aristotle, and
Plotinus are part of the Islamic tradition in the same manner that Abraham is regarded to be
a prophet of Islam."
Theurgy (from Greek θεουργία) describes the practice of rituals, sometimes seen
as magical in nature, performed with the intention of invoking the action or evoking
the presence of one or more gods, especially with the goal of uniting with the divine,
achieving henosis, and perfecting oneself.
You see my point, I hope, how I could plough on forever exposing the Christian claptrap to the light of
day. I cannot be bothered - you either 'get it' by now, or you never will.
Since I first climbed out of 'the glittering web' of false assumptions and so began to recognise Christianity
for the historical fraud it is, I have wondered: who did it? With thought over time, it seemed likely to me
that those people then are connected to the academic frauds of modern times, those who read IC XP in
the early texts and claim it says Jesus Christ, those who deceive their students into believing that original
ancient documents exist, when what we have is works by anonymous monks claiming to be making
copies originally written by 'ghosts'.
In other words, the original fraud has continued to the present day and will continue until it is exposed
and stopped.
Here is the sort of place I'm looking for - Carolingian and buried in the Swiss countryside:
The Abbey of Saint Gall is a Roman Catholic religious complex in the city of St.
Gallen in Switzerland of a dissolved abbey (747-1805). The Carolingian



era monastery has existed since 719 and became an independent principality between 9th
and 13th centuries, and was for many centuries one of the chief Benedictine abbeys in
Europe.
Catholic Encyclopedia (1913), Volume 6
Abbey of St. Gall
The abbey gave hospitality to numerous Anglo-Saxon and Irish monks who came to copy
manuscripts for their own monasteries. Two distinguished guests of the abbey were Peter
and Romanus, chanters from Rome, sent by Pope Adrian I at Charlemagne's request to
propagate the use of the Gregorian chant. Peter went on to Metz, where he established an
important chant-school, but Romanus, having fallen sick at St. Gall, stayed there with
Charlemagne's consent.
I've been checking monasteries of the period, especially their scriptoria and notice how with
Charlemagne's authority, British monks were visiting them. I think this is actually when, where and how
the false textual tradition was composed. Those historians who know this period and these places better
than me should look, too.
The Abbey Library of Saint Gall was founded by Saint Othmar, the founder of the Abbey of
St. Gall.
The library collection is the oldest in Switzerland, and is one of earliest and most important
monastic libraries in the world. It holds 2,100 manuscripts dating back to the 8th through the
15th centuries, 1,650 incunabula (printed before 1500), and old printed books. The library
holds almost 160,000 volumes. The manuscript B of the Nibelungenlied is kept here.
I think it very likely that the Roman Church kept a record of their work; I doubt it is in the hands of the
known, monastic orders, but rather is secreted away. Switzerland would be a good place.

Archbishop Odgar of Mainz (right)
Having revealed how from the early-first century there was a religion termed Chrestianity and the texts
termed 'early Christian' are actually Chrestian; much of the history of the Roman Empire has been
erased; the 'textual tradition' (Church histories and anti-heresies in particular) is largely mythological (and
possibly dated too early); I have been looking at who may have led such a project as the creation of
Christianity. In my previous two posts, I suggested that Carolingian scriptoria such as at St. Gall could be
useful starting points.
In the last day or two, this inventor of Christianity was revealed to me by Kenneth Clark in episode 1 of
his Civilisation:



"How did he do it? Well first of all, with the help of an outstanding teacher and librarian named Alcuin of
York, he collected books and had them copied..."
"...only three of four antique manuscripts of the Latin authors are still in existence. Our whole
knowledge of ancient literature is due to the collecting and copying that began under
Charlemagne."
From Wiki's biography on this man:
Alcuin of York (Latin: Alcuinus, c. 735 – 19 May 804), also called Ealhwine, Albinus or
Flaccus, was an English scholar, ecclesiastic, poet and teacher from York, Northumbria. He
was born around 735 and became the student of Archbishop Ecgbert at York. At the
invitation of Charlemagne, he became a leading scholar and teacher at the Carolingian
court, where he remained a figure in the 780s and 790s. He wrote many theological and
dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. He was
made Abbot of Tours in 796, where he remained until his death. "The most learned man
anywhere to be found", according to Einhard's Life of Charlemagne, he is considered
among the most important architects of the Carolingian Renaissance. Among his pupils
were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.
Alcuin was born in Northumbria, presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is
known of his parents, family background, or origin. In common hagiographical fashion,
the Vita Alcuiniasserts that Alcuin was 'of noble English stock,'...The York school was
renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in
religious matters. It was from here that Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead
at the Frankish court.He joined an illustrious group of scholars that Charlemagne had
gathered around him, the mainsprings of the Carolingian Renaissance: Peter of Pisa,
Paulinus of Aquileia, Rado, and Abbot Fulrad. Alcuin would later write that "the Lord was
calling me to the service of King Charles."
He was welcomed at the Palace School of Charlemagne in Aachen (Urbs Regale) in 782.
Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin
revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to
the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the
extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'. Alcuin also
developed manuals used in his educational work – a grammar and works on rhetoric and
dialectics.
Alcuin of York and ancient manuscripts



In short, this man appears from nowhere; he is not a monk, yet he works with them; he goes to Charles I
and becomes his tutor; with the king's authority, he founds a School, writes instruction manuals and
teaches other intellectuals in how to write what he wants. Now, the politics of Church and State in
recreating the Western Roman Empire:
In 799, Pope Leo III had been mistreated by the Romans, who tried to put out his eyes and
tear out his tongue. Leo escaped and fled to Charlemagne at Paderborn, asking him to
intervene in Rome and restore him. Charlemagne, advised by scholar Alcuin of York,
agreed to travel to Rome, doing so in November 800 and holding a council on 1 December.
On 23 December Leo swore an oath of innocence. At Mass, on Christmas Day
(25 December), when Charlemagne knelt at the altar to pray, the
Pope crowned him Imperator Romanorum ("Emperor of the Romans") in Saint Peter's
Basilica.
Here is the logic of the argument:
There is no Jesus Christ, or Christianity in the early centuries.
There is much reliable evidence in the same period for IS Chrest and Chrestanity, with the Chi
Rho and Tau-Rho.
The date on which Jesus Christ and Christianity first appear is unknown; none of the early texts
have been dated reliably; we do not know when the codices are altered from Chrest to Christ.
The start of the textual tradition has been dated by consensus, using the unreliable method of
paleography, to the 6th century.
Yet Alcuin began his 'copying' in the 8th century, so the start of the textual tradition must, perforce.
be the 8th century.
Changing the original early texts to match the textual tradition will have happened as part of one
process and that is in the 8th century, by Alcuin.
This process is carried out at the same time across Western Europe; as this needed a single
authority and such authority did not exist until there was an emperor, it must have happened under
the authority of Charlemagne.
Having convinced Charles I of the need for Christianity - and this would have been to found a new
empire - Alcuin must have persuaded the Chrestian bishop of Rome how both the bishop and Charles I
would benefit from recognising each other's authority.



In the Bibliothèque Nationale de France
Let us see how the Roman Church treats Alcuin:
An important feature of Alcuin's educational work at York was the care and preservation, as
well as the enlargement, of its precious library. Several times he journeyed through Europe
for the purpose of copying and collecting books. Numerous pupils, too, gathered around
him, from all parts of England and the continent...
Alcuin perceived in the growing power of Charlemagne and his eagerness for the
development of learning an opportunity such as even York, with all its pre-eminence and
scholastic advantages, could not afford. Nor was he disappointed. Charlemagne counted on
education to complete the work of empire-building in which he was engaged, and his mind
was busy with educational projects...
Charlemagne himself, his queen, Luitgard, his sister Gisela, his three sons and two
daughters became pupils of the school, an example which the rest of the nobility were not
slow to imitate.
...the bent of his genius responded perfectly to the imperative intellectual need of the age,
which was the preservation and the representation to the world of the treasures of
knowledge inherited from the past, long buried out of sight by the successive tides of
barbarian invasion.
Educator and scholar
...a series of decrees or capitulars were issued in the name of the Emperor, which enjoined



upon all clerics, secular as well as regular, under penalty of suspension deprivation of office,
the ability to read and write and the possession of the knowledge requisite for the intelligent
performance of the duties of the clerical state. Reading-schools were to be established for
the benefit of candidates for the priesthood, and bishops were required to examine their
clergy from time to time, to ascertain the degree of their compliance with these educational
laws.
Alcuin as a theologian
His nine Scriptural commentaries — on Genesis, The Psalms, The Song of Solomon,
Ecclesiastes, Hebrew Names, St. John's Gospel, the Epistles to Titus, Philemon, and the
Hebrews, The Sayings of St. Paul, and the Apocalypse — consist mostly of sentences
taken from the Fathers, the idea, apparently, being to collect into convenient form the
observations on the more important Scriptural passages of the best commentators who had
preceded him. A more important Biblical undertaking by Alcuin was the revision of the text
of the Latin Vulgate...varying texts were often to be found in the Bibles used in the same
house.
In his letters he simply mentions the fact that he is engaged, by the order of Charlemagne,
"in emendatione Veteris Novique Testamenti" (Ep., 136). Four Bibles are shown by the
dedicatory poems affixed to them to have been prepared by him, or under his direction at
Tours, probably during the years 799-801.
Alcuin as a liturgist
Besides his justly merited fame as an educator and a theologian, Alcuin has the honour of
having been the principle agent in the great work of liturgical reform accomplished by the
authority of Charlemagne.
It was the purpose of the King to substitute the Roman rite in place of the Gallican, or at
least to bring about such a revision of the latter as to make it substantially one with the
Roman. The strong leaning of Alcuin towards the traditions of the Roman Church, combined
with his conservative character and the universal authority of his name, qualified him for the
accomplishment of a change which the royal authority in itself was powerless to effect.
The work of Alcuin which had the greatest and most lasting influence in this direction,
however, was the Sacramentary, or Missal which he compiled, using the Gregorian
Sacramentary as a basis, and to this adding a supplement of other liturgical sources.
Prescribed as the official Mass-book for the Frankish Church, Alcuin's Missal soon came to
be commonly used throughout Europe and was largely instrumental in bringing about
uniformity in respect to the liturgy of the Mass in the whole Western Church.
Here we have one man who used the ambitions of Charles I and Leo III to create a new religion, a new
Church, a new empire, and a new history of the original, Roman empire. He (with his students) did it all.

Evidence-based history
The orthodox history of this period
is backward looking, interpreting
selective data through the beliefs of
later times. With reliable dating to
establish a secure chronology, the
perspective offered here does the
opposite, following the
development of ideas through the
archaeological record of
successive generations.
We approach the information tabula
rasa, in a scientific manner, with no
prior judgements or biases. The
archaeological record is allowed to
speak for itself as much as
possible. Similarly, expert opinion is
often quoted where appropriate,
linked to the source.
The introduction provides a brief
summary, based on our reading of
the evidences. Excavations are on
going, new artefacts (including
texts) come to light and as we gain
both new technologies and better
methods, so we should expect
more. Though much evidence has
been destroyed over the centuries,
there is good reason to be
optimistic for better, more complete
interpretation in future.

Alciun and fraud on a monumental scale
Charlemagne and his minister Alcuin.
Alcuin was not a monk, though this is how he was popularly displayed.
This post is for those who may be looking deeper into the role of Alcuin as inventor of Christianity. Earlier, I posted
about the possible role of the princely scriptorium at St. Gall, Switzerland, in this immense process:
1. The Christian Conspiracy
2. Princely Scriptoria
Here are some references, notes and thoughts on this. We see how monks from the British Isles visited the abbey of
St. Gall, where the works of Alcuin were held in high esteem:
The presence of Alcuin’s Disputatio de rhetorica et de virtutibus at St. Gall is similarly well-attested
with no fewer than four ninth century manuscripts from its library used in the critical edition.
Whereas ideas of faith and baptism offered Alcuin a way to frame the cardinal virtues for the
Charlemagne, here the absence of understanding faith and baptism provided Notker with a reason to
ridicule all involved in Louis the Pious’ Easter services.
The real dissonance was not between the Franks and the Northmen. It was between the characters in
the story and Notker, who felt he understood the truth of the matter - the sacramental underpinnings
of an imperium christianum. The juxtaposition of religious, political, and social confusion was not a
simple contrast. The episode did not pit the Franks against the Northmen and it did not contrast
religious with political and social dimensions of the sacramentum; rather, the monk of St. Gall
cleverly lamented that neither the Franks nor the Northmen recognized that properly understood
sacraments had simultaneous religious, political, and social import.
Another familiar cue supplied by Notker, helping knowledgeable readers interpret his criticism, was
Jesus’ Great Commission from the Gospel of Matthew, which the monk of St. Gall provided with some
additional packaging in order to drive home his disappointment with Louis’ practice.

British at the Carolingian St. Gall:
The manuscript, which is mentioned in the oldest catalogue, was written at St Gall in the first half of
the ninth century by an Anglo-Saxon. He had lived long enough on the Continent to acquire the
Carolingian script. There is no mention of Eadbeorht in any of the St Gall official documents, so that
he may have been an inmate of another monastery, who spent a year or so at St Gall. The name occurs
in the Alemannic form in a deed dated September 1, 764, as Otpret, but this is scarcely the same
person. On the other hand the name occurs no less than three times in the necrologium of Fulda, the
deaths of two priests and one monk named Otbraht being recorded under the dates 842, 864 and 869.
If Anglo-Saxon monks at St Gall are a doubtful quantity, there is no doubt that the contribution of
Britain to the intellectual life of the monastery was considerable. Anglo-Saxon scholarship was held in
high esteem. Notker Balbulus referred to Bede as “the most learned priest, who was indeed the ablest
commentator of Holy Writ since St Gregory.” There were several copies of Bede’s works in the abbey
library, and a much later tradition, first recorded by Metzler, tells of a visit to St Gall by the historian
of the English Church‘. This is proved to be unfounded by Bede’s own statement that he never left the
monastery of Jarrow.
We also know from Notker’s anecdotes how popular Alcuin was at St Gall.

The Greek 'H', which is the Latin 'E" was altered to read 'I' - from Chrest to Christ.
We have seen how the oldest codices of the New Testament were originally and explicitly Chrestian; these were
altered at a later, unknown date, to become Christian.
I am identifying Alcuin as the author of this change and thus inventing Christianity as he (and his students) made
these textual alterations:
A correctory is any of the text-forms of the Latin Vulgate resulting from the critical emendation as
practised during the course of the thirteenth century.
Owing to the carelessness of transcribers, the conjectural corrections of critics, the insertion
of glosses and paraphrases, and especially to the preference for readings found in the earlier Latin
versions, the text of St. Jerome was corrupted at an early date. Around 550 CE, Cassiodorus made
an attempt at restoring the purity of the Latin text.
Charlemagne entrusted the same labour to Alcuin, who presented his royal patron with a
corrected copy in 801. Similar attempts were repeated by Theodulphus, Bishop of
Orléans [787(?) – 821], Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury (1070–1089), Stephen Harding, Abbot
of Cîteaux (1109–1134), and Deacon Nicolaus Maniacoria (about the beginning of the thirteenth
century). At this period, the need of a revised Latin text of the Vulgate became more imperative
than ever.
When, towards the end of the twelfth century, the schools of Paris were organized into
the Sorbonne university and its various faculties adopted the same reference texts, the faculty of
theology, too, adhered to a uniform text of the Latin Bible. (Correctory)
Now to some personal comments.
The artefactal evidences for Chrestianity were published on the web, by me, some years ago. They have since been
been copied and discussed extensively (as well as indexed by Google Search). Anyone with an active interest on the
subject will have found them; I note that now, various scholars openly admit to knowing how the early texts claimed
by and for Christianity actually reference Chrest rather than Christ.
Even so, those who now have the facts are reluctant to admit how:
1. there was a religion I term Chrestian in the days of the Western Roman Empire; and
2. there is no good evidence for Christianity in that same period.
We can now point to Alcuin as the person responsible for more than the broad, textual tradition, for we see that
this encompassed altering the New Testament to become Christian.
There are national and international, government-backed organisations to study these codices. I have followed with
interest how they change their public stance on them in a vain effort to counter my evidence-based history as it
advances. The Christian mafia in Wikipedia does the same. We are not dealing here with honest scholars making
their best endeavour to enlighten and educate with science and reason, but with paid lackies serving the agenda of
a united Church and State.
Why have no early texts been dated reliably? Not a single one. There you have the situation in a nutshell.
This is a fraud on a monumental scale and it extends from Alcuin unto today.

Alcuin of York - a recapitulaton - Origins of Christianity
11-14 minutes
Codex Sinaiticus is regarded as one of the oldest versions of the New Testament; it - like all the texts mis-termed early-Christian - made no mention of Jesus Christ, or Christian/Christianity; we now know they are Chrestian, because wherever the title is spelled out in the early texts, that's how it is; we have other artefacts of that period, also of that type. We also know that the earliest Christians who appear in the historical record - whether as real, historical people, or as the 'ghosts' of the Christian, textual tradition, were fully aware of the facts in my opening sentence here. We know, because Lactantius - real, or ghost - said so, as we see in the works attributed to him (see above image).
The Lactantius claim, is (like that for himself as historical) outright laughable, hilarious, even derisory: how come people centuries after could know better than all the claimed witnesses and adherents? Some imperial official is supposed to have converted to this religion and then somehow knew how the authors of the canonical gospels - the whole New Testament even - and all the correspondences until his time, were ignorant and wrong. Well, if they didn't know, what else didn't they know, and if they all were ignorant and wrong, why believe them in everything else? It's plain stupid to imagine it so.
Next, we see that the change of the eta to an iota to make Chrest into Christ is deliberate, both in the original codices and in the theology (as explained by this Lactantius character). This is important to understand, so I repeat:the change from Chrest to Christ is deliberate, in the texts and in the Roman Church.
When I studied the start of the Christian textual tradition, I found that the earliest texts - and this is true for virtually all the ghostly authors (including Lactantius) - are by consensus dated to the sixth century. None are dated reliably, scientifically - which reveals much about modern scholarship - which brings us to my point.
We saw in my post Alcuin, inventor of Christianity, how only three (or possibly four) of the Latin books of antiquity survived into the Carolingian period and Alcuin is now held largely responsible for us having very many others. He did this, it is claimed, by collecting and copying, using the vast resources of Charlemagne. The books attributed to this Lactantius character are Latin and fall into this category.
We therefore must see Alcuin and the scriptorium at Aachen as responsible for bringing Lactantius to us; thus this is when, how and under whose authority Chrest became Christ. The change is when and how Chrestianity became Christianity.



Folio 34r of the Book of Kells contains the Chi Rho monogram. This book is in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables. It was created in a Columban monastery in either Britain or Ireland or may have had contributions from various Columban institutions from both Britain and Ireland. It is believed to have been created ca. 800 AD. The text of the Gospels is largely drawn from the Vulgate, although it also includes several passages drawn from the earlier versions of the Bible known as the Vetus Latina.
We see in the artefacts of this period a cross-over, where Chrestian symbols are mixed with Christ. This is what we should expect to see if Alcuin began Christianity.
Since that post, we have enjoyed some good, pertinent comments, including questions. Dirk Puehl raised some issues, including: how could, or would, Alcuin and the Roman Church have caused the Eastern Roman Empire to also adopt, or change to Christianity? I will address that here.
The torture and martyrdom of the iconophile Bishop Euthymius of Sardeis by the iconoclast Byzantine Emperor Michael II in 824, in a 13th-century manuscript
First, how do we know what happened? The source materials in the West were composed by the same people who composed the fraudulent, Christian textual tradition - Acuin & Company. I think we should regard this 'history' as unreliable.
As an example: Adoptionism. I have stated a number of times now how I regard the main objective of the literary fraud was to mirror the Roman Empire, this time around writing into it a spurious history of the Roman Church. Thus, the various purported 'heresies' did not, could not exist. Adoptionism is a label which can be used correctly to describe imperial policy for succession in the Principate:
Imperial succession
In the Roman Empire, adoption was the most common way of acceding to the throne without use of force. The second emperor, Tiberius, was the adopted son of Augustus, beginning a general tradition that the Emperor adopt his successor. During the Roman



Empire's first 200 years, this tradition was common, with Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, and Lucius Verus all becoming Emperor through adoption.
I therefore have serious doubts as to the claimed history of Adoptionism in the time of Alcuin.
In short, as Alcuin takes responsibility for the textual tradition and it is fraudulent, we don't really know what happened from the Western, Roman point of view:
Byzantine Iconoclasm (Greek: Εἰκονομαχία, Eikonomachía) refers to two periods in the history of the Byzantine Empire when the use of religious images or icons was opposed by religious and imperial authorities within the Eastern Church and the temporal imperial hierarchy. The "First Iconoclasm", as it is sometimes called, lasted between about 726 and 787. The "Second Iconoclasm" was between 814 and 842.
Second, there is another possible cause of major confusion: what was Roman and what was Byzantine? They were mixed up:
The Exarchate (orange) and the Lombards (gray) in 590
The Exarchate of Ravenna or of Italy was a center of Byzantine (East Roman) power in Italy, from the end of the 6th century to 751, when the last exarch was put to death by the Lombards. The exarchate was organised into a group of duchies (i.e. the Duchy of Rome, Duchy of Venetia, Duchy of Calabria, Duchy of Naples, Duchy of Perugia, Duchy of the Pentapolis,Duchy of Lucania etc.) which were mainly the coastal cities in the Italian peninsula since the Lombards held the advantage in the hinterland. The civil and military head of these imperial possessions, the exarch himself, was the representative at Ravenna of the emperor in Constantinople. Ravenna remained the



seat of the exarch until the revolt of 727 over iconoclasm. Eutychius, the last exarch of Ravenna, was killed by the Lombards in 751. The exarchate was reorganized as the Catapanate of Italy headquartered in Bari which was lost to the Saracens in 847 and only recovered in 871. When in 756 the Franks drove the Lombards out, Pope Stephen II claimed the exarchate. His ally Pepin the Younger, King of the Franks, donated the conquered lands of the former exarchate to the Papacy in 756; this donation, which was confirmed by his son Charlemagne in 774, marked the beginning of the temporal power of the popes as the Patrimony of Saint Peter.
Third, when Charles I was made emperor, Charlemagne, Constantinople had no emperor, but a widow:
Irene of Athens or Irene the Athenian (Greek: Εἰρήνη ἡ Ἀθηναία) (c. 752 – 9 August 803) is the commonly known name of Irene Sarantapechaina (Greek: Εἰρήνη Σαρανταπήχαινα), Byzantine empress regnant from 797 to 802. Prior to becoming empress regnant, Irene was empress consort from 775 to 780, and empress dowager and regent from 780 to 797.
Pope Leo III refused to recognise Irene's authority; in crowning Charles as emperor, Leo was acting as head of Christendom, above Constantinople.
Fourth, my feeling is that Iconoclasm was more than just a war about images. My email correspondence from 2010:
From me: ...this subject I am looking at: the possibility that divine men were created by resurrecting people from the past through making their statue, then imbuing it with the spirit of the dead person. Though this - if right - would have added to our general understanding of divine men and how they were produced, it could be applicable to Hadrian's statue making program. The idea came to me from a recent archaeological study of stupas containing relics of Buddha: I had trouble understanding this clearly, but the view seemed to me to be that when the relic was placed in a stupa, on a site visited by Buddha, it became the living Buddha. The Byzantine Iconoclasts, who destroyed countless thousands of statues for divine men, had the idea, I think, that they had to destroy them because they contained some form of animus, of 'pagan' spirit of the person whom was represented by the statue. That is, early Christians believed the same Greek magic used to make the statue and divine man, and needed to exorcise the demon, or spirit.
To me: the Byzantine Iconoclastic movement seems to have realised how pagan are some Christian beliefs. Those arguing against it, I note, plunder the Hebrew bible for justification, unaware how some of these texts are late and reflect Persian, pagan influences (as we noted in Qumran texts). Christianity contains a lot of magic. Christians believe in demons, ghosts, spirits, angels, and possession. Those attacking Iconoclasm freely admit to worshipping icons and statues and this, I think, is critical. (I also note than when I was a child and made the same claim, my teachers denied it.) Why where so many thousands of statues made to Hadrian's order? People today forget that there were made to stand in temples - we forget, because we see them as art and their modern context is as objects for display. They were worshipped. They were regarded as divine - not artistic representations of a divine, but possessed of the divine spirit. Iconoclasts destroyed them, I suspect, not just because they represented something pagan, but because everyone - everyone regardless of what else they believed - knew that inside the statue was the spirit of the divine person represented by the statue. If a person did not share that faith, then they regarded that spirit as a demon - and nobody likes or wants demons, so they destroyed the statue and the demon. The Iconoclasts were exorcising the demons. It was all magic. Hadrian drowned Antinous because he loved him so much that he wanted to make him divine - something he was empowered to do as Pontifex Maximus, and with magic from his Greek friends and priests such as Plutarch. Hadrian has all those statues placed in temples because they contained the animus of his gods, and so projected his power. It was not symbollic, but real. These spirits were working for him. His temples are like the electricity grid and the statues like the worldwide web - and information is power, as they say. Theological scholars seem to agree how Hadrian built no statues of Jesus. Hmmm - but is that so? What did Antinous look like? What did Alexander look like? Were not they all the same, and all Helios? In this scenario and as my posts have been indicating, Jesus Christ is Helios, as is Alexander the Great, Dionysus, Bacchus, Hercules and so on, on to Mithras with his 4 horses, and Sol Invictus.



How JC statues do not appear until later, is that later, people either forgot that JC was Helios, or the Iconoclasts destroyed the more obvious evidence - both temples and statues.
More in this vein followed and my feeling was that perhaps the Iconoclasm wars were actually a reflection of the change from Chrest to Christ, trying to obfuscate the role of Greek Magic and solar worship. Though Christianity looks more modern - less primitive and obviously superstitious - than Chrestianity, the new carried much of the old with it; religion cannot escape belief in the supernatural.
It seems to me that with Alcuin, Charlemagne and the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, with the start of the Christian textual tradition out of the imperial scriptorium at Aachen, we have identified the founders of Christianity. We see in the early codices how Chrest became Christ and this is down to Alcuin (even if, as Dirk suggests, somebody had the big idea first and Alcuin was recruited merely to execute the Grand Design). If I'm wrong, who else is suggested by the evidence?

Archaeological stratigraphy at the Iron Age site of Goosehill Camp on Bow Hill, England.
Reader emails tell me how there is some confusion (if not lack of understanding) for my basic argument, that artefacts - textual included - belong to the cultural layer in which they are found. If perchance they have no such context (as with many "sacred texts" using nomina sacra and/or Chrest), then their cultural layer will be understood as the culture which made and used the artefact.
Archaeology can be described as studying cultural layers, so this principle should be readily understood by all in that field. For everyone else:
Stratigraphy is a key concept to modern archaeological theory and practice. Modern excavation techniques are based on stratigraphic principles. The concept derives from the geological use of the idea that sedimentation takes place according to uniform principles. When archaeological finds are below the surface of the ground (as is most commonly the case), the identification of the context of each find is vital in enabling the archaeologist to draw conclusions about the site and about the nature and date of its
occupation. It is the archaeologist's role to attempt to discover what contexts exist and how they came to be created. Archaeological stratification or sequence is the dynamic superimposition of single units of stratigraphy, or contexts. Contexts are single events or actions that leave discrete, detectable traces in the archaeological sequence or stratigraphy. They can be deposits (such as the back-fill of a ditch), structures (such as walls), or "zero thickness surfaciques," better known as "cuts." Cuts represent actions that remove other solid contexts such as fills, deposits, and walls. An example would be a ditch "cut" through earlier deposits. Stratigraphic relationships are
the relationships created between contexts in time, representing the chronological order they were created. (Emphasismine.)
Some principles:
A cultural layer beneath another is older, and vice versa. If an artefact of a more recent cultural layer is deliberately pushed into an older, lower layer, this is fraud.



Proper examination of the cultural layer can usually date that layer and thus, help date artefacts found in that layer. Proper examination of an artefact may include one or more scientific dating methods, which may help date both the cultural layer and the date of manufacture of the artefact (which may be earlier than the layer itself). An artefact presented outside of any context (e.g. somebody turns up at a museum with an artefact and the experts cannot study the cultural layer in which the 'finder' claims to have found it), has lost most of its informational value.
A textual artefact such as a fragment of papyri or leather, with writing upon it, may be regarded as containing a number of layers, each with its own date:
The medium used to carrying the writing. For papyrus, this is when the plant was cut and died; for leather, this is when the animal was killed for its skin. This date may be measurably before anyone wrote on it, or even prepared it for writing. The writing. If ink was used, it may be possible to (a) date the ink, and/or (b) analyse it for its chemical composition - and this may help in dating.
The parchments used commonly in monastic scriptoria were relatively expensive, which encouraged them to re-use them as often as possible. Also as agreed theology changed, so the wording of an old text may have needed to be altered. For these reasons, numerous texts produced by the Roman Church contain their own layers, the older ones perhaps revealed by modern technology.
Codex Hierosolymitanus, an 11th-century Greek manuscript written by an unknown scribe named Leo, who dated it 1056. Researchers found that the parchment had once contained ancient philosophical writings that had later been washed off and over-written. Using multispectral imaging, scientists have been able to recover the original text, shedding new light on the history of philosophical education in the late antiquity.
In the above example, there are a number of layers: the parchment - when the animal was killed and when it was made; then the Greek philosophy was written onto the parchment; when this was hidden and overwritten. As the two sets of writing are significantly different in character, one may suppose that each belonged to a different culture (the earlier being a part of the culture which produced the parchment, the later belonging to monastic culture which hid the earlier before over-writing).
Scholars claim that the most-altered text in existence is what some think to be the earliest known version of the New Testament, Codex Sinaiticus:
The codex is an Alexandrian text-type manuscript written in the 4th century in uncial letters on parchment. Current scholarship considers the Codex Sinaiticus to be one of the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with that of the Codex Vaticanus. The Codex Sinaiticus came to the attention of scholars in the 19th century at the Saint Catherine's Monastery, with further material discovered in the 20th and 21st centuries. Although parts of the Codex are scattered across four libraries around the world, most of the manuscript today resides within the British Library. The codex has been corrected many thousands of times, making it one of the most corrected manuscripts in existence...
This codex therefore has no provenance before the 19th century. Though studied by leading scholars, no attempt has ever been made to date it reliably; its date so far is merely a matter of judgement, largely on the style of writing (paleography), which is notoriously unreliable for sacred texts (if only because of Christendom's desire to move them back in time, closer to its divine man).



I was the first to point out that the title Christ was added by an unknown hand, at an unknown place and later, though at an unknown time; the title had been spelt originally as Chrest. This series of alterations is quite easy to see - the Greek "H" (in English "E") has been scratched to become "I" - the "eta" ofChrest became "iota" to read Christ.
The example, left, first read: make me a Chrestian.
The original New Testament therefore likely belongs to an earlier and older culture, one which is Chrestian rather than Christian
This older, Chrestian religious culture pre-dates Christianity and its textual artefacts match well the other, numerous artefacts and archaeological sites of Chrest and Chrestianity.
This demonstrates how a reliable history needs to use the same, basic rules of archaeology in order to establish a proper chronology and context with which to work.
This applies equally to the treatment of the numerous 'histories' produced by the Roman Church (whether Chrestian, or Christian), supposedly in the 6th century, which is how I term them a 'textual tradition' rather than a history.
I must add comment on the issue of trust, for this is often raised by believers. The earliest known texts bearing the name (claimed authorship of) "Augustine of Hippo" belong to the 6th century; they were and are claimed to be copies of earlier, which do not exist. Scholars of faith say they trust the claim of the author, but they have addressed the wrong question, because nobody now knows who penned the purported copies - we don't know who that was, or when, where or even under whose authority. The question is thus not whether one trusts the purported Augustine of Hippo, but the unknown hand who penned the claim. As nobody knows anything about this person(s), there is no reason to even consider trust in that regard.
The only proper approach for such texts is to look at the cultural layer in which the purported author is supposed to have existed and see if this person existed, and if they did, whether what we may learn of this person is in accord with the later text. Nobody does this, probably because they see no reason to (they have faith and anyway, they also are driven by self-interest).
For most if not all the claimed authors of this textual tradition, there is little or no evidence that they exist in the cultural layer claimed; that is, the supposed histories written under these names belong entirely to the period in which the oldest, extant copies belong. I hope that by now, you will follow the simple logic of this argument.
Yesterday, I posted to my site this subject page: Eusebius of Caesarea as myth It will demonstrate to you I hope and expect, how much of the purported history for Classical Antiquity is actually mythological - and this fraud was perpetrated by those abusing the simple rules of both archaeology and historiography.

Parody of the Dead Sea Scrolls - Origins of Christianity
2-3 minutes
The book I reference here - I could not possibly review it - has more holes than the proverbial Swiss cheese. The author actually imagines that the New Testament contains a history of Judaea in the first century, with a real, actual, living, divine man Jesus. Oh dear, but never mind; here we'll treat a part of the chapter The Herodians of the Gospel of Mark:
The glaring lacuna of the missing Essenes in the New Testament has removed them from centre field. It would be hard to construct a notion of Essene marginality on the basis of Philo or Josephus, yet they are missing in the New Testament and thus - given the dominant conceptual paradigms created by biblical literature - it seems obvious. Why would the Gospel-writers have avoided mentioning the Essenes if they were powerful players, deeply involved in public debate? If the Pharisees and Sadducees were concerned about Jesus’ interpretations of the law and actions, surely the Essenes - if they played a public role - would also have been concerned? As we have seen, in Philo and Josephus the Essenes are presented as the most exemplary of all Jewish legal ‘societies’ in Judaea and a key paradigm for Judaism as a whole; in the New Testament they are absolutely nowhere. (The Essenes, the Scrolls and the Dead Sea by Joan Taylor, Oxford University Press, 2015)
The gospel writers did not avoid mentioning this sect: the New Testament is all about them, in parody. They are whole point of the New Testament.
The sect which wrote much of the Dead Sea Scrolls, almost certainly in Qumran, next door to the caves in which they buried them, never gave themselves a formal title - not even once. It is therefore unrealistic to expect to find this non-existent title in the New Testament. Instead, they describe themselves using various terms: The Poor (Ebionim, Ebionites), The Way and Nazarite; they also had leaders with titles such as Righteous Teacher and Messiah. We see clear parody with Christian usage of Nazareth, the way and messiah.
I'm saddened to see how even the most modern and prestigious scholarship n this field just tramps along the old textual tradition, with nothing new or important to say.

Chi-Rho is not a Christogram - Origins of Christianity
7-9 minutes
Switzerland is so very proud of this: the earliest archaeological proof, they believe, for a Christian in their nation. This claim rests on one piece of evidence, that the Chi-Rho (roughly circled) is actually a 'Christogram'.
As there is no reason whatsoever to make that bold assumption, what may we learn from this archaeology?
Inscription:
Devotione Vigens / augusta Pontius Aedis (Chi-Rho with alpha and omega) / restituit praetor / longe praestantius illis / quae priscae steterant / talis re publica qu (a) ere / d (omino) n (ostro) Gratiano Aug (usto) IIII et Mer (obaudo) / co (n) s (ulibus) / Pontius Asclepiodotus v (ir) p (erfectissimus) praeses d (e) d (icavit)
Persons:
person 1 name: Gratiano cognomen: Gratianus gender: male status emperor / imperial household person 2 name: Mer. cognomen: Merobaudes* gender: male status senatorial order person 3 name: Pontius Asclepiodotus nomen: Pontius cognomen: Asclepiodotus gender: male status equestrian order
Pontius Asclepiodotus was the Roman provincial governor in Sion. A French newspaper report, via Google translate:



The double Consulate of Gratian and Merobaudes determines that date. In 377, we are under the reign of Gratian, a young man of 18, effective master of the Western world. Without particular merits, he was well served by his generals, at least at the beginning of his reign. Merobaudes was one of them, an expert in wars on the Rhine. He was of Frankish origin, became head of the militia, that is to say, general of the armies of the West. How is this block of marble fail come to Zion? We do not know anything. No more than we know the origin of the mileage that is in the same hall and which originally stood on Vaud soil, on the road of Avenches. What we know is that Zion was playing any political or administrative role. It just, this village was not even the chief place of Séduniens, for the simple reason that the tribe of Séduniens no longer existed as a political district, so to say. This marble comes from Octodure. The great administrative and fiscal reorganization of the empire operated by Diocletian at the beginning of the century brought changes to our township. The Pennine valley is so detached from that of the Isere, with which it had been - probably between Marcus Aurelius and Diocletian - a municipal community of life.
Pontius Asclepiodotus, like all provincial governors, big or small, was primarily an administrator and a judge. It was to be foreign to Octodure. Probably of the order of knights, certainly still young, and who was hand in the capital of a very small country. The title of senator that gives it the inscription, one should not conclude that / he was a Roman senator. That- is totally excluded. Perhaps a member of the senate Octodure. Most prefectures had a body like this, with provincial assemblies. What there is of course, is that municipal life still Octodure, which retains its decurions or tax collectors, magistrates, employees. Octodure has its schoolmaster. Especially, it is required, the old city, to ensure freedom of communication by the collar of Mont Joux. She is best as a tax collection body for the whole Pennine valley and is responsible for all the tax base. * In other words it must deliver annually to the state, that is to say the imperial offices, in gold or in kind, the product of the land tax 'set the country as a whole and unchanged for a fixed term. Tax Inquisition was very thorough, and the governor saw to that. Virtually nothing has been invented. In all provinces periodically proceeded to meticulous censuses, land surveying, determining crop survey of vines, counting animals. Every fifteen years had held a revision of taxation units, ie, it Dait procedure for the revision of cadastral taxes. We can, without much effort imagnination, represent the Imperial Commissioner in the exercise of its Octodure functions or making frequent roadside inspections of Summus Penninus. Because everything is conditioned on the merits by this great way of 600 km, in excellent condition, covered by a continuous cartage and Octodure which earned special privileges. The governor also had to be some kind of engineer of Roads and Bridges. He was monitoring the imperial post, reserved only for purposes of administration, as well as relay established on the road. (Pontius Asclepiodotus, Confédéré, 11 December 1953)
The archaeological record tells us without any doubt how Constantine I the Great adopted the Chi-Rho. Later in that century, the alpha-to-omega appears with the Chi-Rho and is added to the Book of Revelation.
What is lacking is any evidence for Constantine's conversion to Christianity, or even for Christianity itself, or the 313 Edict of Milan. The Chi-Rho tells instead of conversion to Chrestianity. With that in mind, the career of Pontius Asclepiodotus and his religious affiliation make a different sense.
In 382, Gratian appropriated the income of the Pagan priests and Vestal Virgins, forbade legacies of real property to them and abolished other privileges belonging to the Vestals and to the pontiffs. He confiscated the personal possessions of the colleges of Pagan priests, which also lost all their privileges and immunities. Gratian declared that all of the Pagan temples and shrines were to be confiscated by the government and that their revenues
were to be joined to the property of the royal treasury.[11]He ordered another removal of the Altar of Victory from the Senate House at Rome, despite protests of the pagan members
of the Senate, and confiscated its revenues.[12][13] Pagan Senators responded by sending an appeal to Gratian, reminding him that he was still the Pontifex Maximus and that it was his duty to see that the Pagan rites were properly performed. They appealed to Gratian to restore the Altar of Victory and the rights and privileges of the Vestal Virgins and priestly colleges. Gratian, at the urging of Ambrose, did not grant an audience to the Pagan Senators. In response to being reminded by the Pagans that he was still the head of the ancestral religion, Gratian refused to wear the insignia of the Pontifex Maximus as unbefitting a Christian, renouncing the title and office of Pontifex Maximus under the influence of Ambrose, declaring that it was unsuitable for a Christian to hold this office. Gratian was quickly faced with a revolt from Magnus Maximus to the throne because he was more sympathetic to the Pagan cause. Notwithstanding his actions, Gratian was still deified after his death.



Once the late sources are placed in their proper context - the period in which they appear, rather than earlier - and one treats his reign with textual and other artefacts belonging to it, this history becomes clarified.
Gratian, as with emperors earlier that century, is Chrestian. His interest is centralisation of power, including monies, into his hands. Regardless of all the chatter here regarding the pagan title Pontifex Maximus, it has been used and is used to this day by the Church of Rome:
The word "pontifex" later became a term used for Christian bishops,[4] including the Bishop
of Rome,[5] and the title of "Pontifex Maximus" was applied within the Roman Catholic
Church to the Pope as its chief bishop. It is not included in the Pope's official titles,[6] but appears on buildings, monuments and coins of popes of Renaissance and modern times.
The declaration by Pontius Asclepiodotus is therefore a sign of loyalty to the imperial cause, expected of an official entirely dependent on this cause.
Archaeologists need to re-evaluate all artefacts bearing the Chi-Rho.

Tau Rho staurogram - also not a Christogram - Origins of
Christianity
6-8 minutes
A Tau Rho staurogram in P75, Mater Verbi (Bodmer) Papyrus.
Dated paleographically to the third century (with most scholars tending toward the earlier half of that century). Contains major portions of Luke and John. The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian, closer to Codex Vaticanus than to Codex Sinaiticus.
Though we have addressed this before, the subject keeps reappearing in scholarly papers and books, all of which assume how it is Christian. However, that is not its history, as even Christian apologists admit:
...the device itself is pre-Christian, used for more mundane purposes, e.g., as an abbreviation for “three/thirty”. Early on (likely sometime in the second century), Christians appropriated the device and invested it with a new function and meaning all their own. The earliest Christian uses extant are in NT manuscripts: P75, P66 and P45, which are typically dated to the early 3rd century CE. As Robin Jensen has observed, in these cases the staurogram likely served as a pictographic reference to the crucified Jesus. (The “Staurogram”: Newly published article, February 15, 2013)
Two problems with that:
1. It's early usage was unexplained at the time; later interpretations are more wishful thinking than evidence-based. 2. The 'early' texts do not use the terms Christ/Christian/Christianity - they are pre-Christian.
The Tau-Rho certainly has a sacred meaning, only it is not Christian, but Chrestian. We know this as a certifiable, verifiable fact because Chrest is actually used in monumental inscriptions, a legal document, a church mosaic and in some of the texts. Christ is never used.
Chrestianity has much archaeological support; everything labelled as "early Christian" is stolen.
The connection between the Tau Rho and crucifixion is interesting. Visually, it looks obvious, as the loop of the Rho could also be a man's head above the cross-bar. This could therefore be regarded as a strong link between the Ptolemaic faith (Chrestian, or otherwise) and the gospel crucifixion.



Antinous the God,
Who is among the Shining Ones of Heaven,
Has been transfigured into a God of Eternal Youth,
Perfect of countenance,
Who is dazzling in beauty of the eyes,
Whose heart is full of heroic joy
Since He received the order of the Gods
At the hour of his death.
Every ritual of the Book of the Hours
Shall be repeated for him
Along with each of His Mysteries.
His Word shall be spread to the whole world.
His teaching shall be a never-ending river
Of admonition, inspiration and mystery.
Nothing comparable has been conferred
On any mortal man before now,
Just as with His altars, His temples
And His sacred images.
The link between the two is death and resurrection, which lies at the centre of the Osiris Myth, celebrated in Egypt from pharaonic into Roman times, thanks to the Ptolemaic syncretisms. We know how Hadrian used this as the basis of his sacrificing Antinous and resurrecting him as divine - it is written on the Antinous obelisk in Rome, taken there by a pope.
This is how we also know that the gospels are post-Hadrian.



The Tau Rho in a church mosaic at Moshav Aluma, Israel; dated ca. 500 CE. The addition of the alpha/omega to the Tau Rho is typical for the late-4th century and after.
According to archaeologist Dr. Daniel Varga, directing the excavations on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, "An impressive basilica building was discovered at the site, 22 meters long and 12 meters wide. The building consists of a central hall with two side aisles divided by marble pillars. At the front of the building is a wide open courtyard (atrium) paved with a white mosaic floor, and with a cistern. Leading off the courtyard is a rectangular transverse hall (narthex) with a fine mosaic floor decorated with colored geometric designs; at its center, opposite the entrance to the main hall, is a twelve-row dedicatory inscription in Greek containing the names Mary and Jesus, and the name of the person who funded the mosaic's construction."
I thought this most unlikely and so contacted the archaeologist directly, getting this reply:
The first row of the Nartex inscription: + xmr which almost certainly can be translated as: (cross) Christ born of Mary
Very interesting, but clearly not quite matching the claim. The meaning is discussed here:
ΧΜΓ, a Symbol of Christ Author(s): William K. Prentice Source: Classical Philology, Vol. 9, No. 4 (Oct., 1914), pp. 410-416 Published by: The University of Chicago Press Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/261452
In short, there is no substantial evidence for the meaning and its interpretation is very much open to debate. Here's a complete alternative: it is Hebrew for ass, or donkey (as per Genesis) and as such, can be related to the Alexmenos graffito:



The Alexamenos graffito is an inscription carved in plaster on a wall near the Palatine Hill in Rome, now in the Palatine Antiquarium Museum. The image depicts a human-like figure affixed to a cross and possessing the head of a donkey. In the top right of the image is what has been interpreted as either the Greek letter upsilon or a tau cross. Beneath the cross is a caption written in crude Greek: Αλεξαμενος ςεβετε θεον. ςεβετε can be understood as a variant spelling (possibly a phonetic misspelling) of Standard Greek ςεβεται, which means "worships". The full inscription would then be translated as "Alexamenos worships [his] God". Several other sources suggest "Alexamenos worshipping God", or similar variants, as the intended translation.
You see, archaeology termed 'early Christian' is mysterious and full of contradictions. Only reading Chrest as Chrest does one begin to make sense of it all.
Papyrus 75
There are a number of variants between P75 (with the Tau Rho); here's one:
In Luke 11:4, the phrase αλλα ρυσαι ημας απο του πονηρου (but deliver us from evil) is omitted. The omission of this phrase is also supported by the following
manuscripts: Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Codex Regius, f1, 700, vg,syrs, copsa, bo, arm, geo.
The oldest texts reflect most accurately the faith at that time. The vast number of additions, omissions and alterations appearing in later texts demonstrate changes in faith/theology; they are not corrections (and could not be).

The introduction provides a brief

the evidences. Excavations are on
going, new artefacts (including

both new technologies and better

there is good reason to be
optimistic for better, more complete

In comparison with other Roman-era religious groups
Religious Networks in the Roman Empire by Anna Collar
Description: The first three centuries AD saw the spread of new religious ideas through the Roman Empire, crossing a vast and diverse
geographical, social and cultural space. In this innovative study, Anna Collar explores both how this happened and why. Drawing on research in
the sociology and anthropology of religion, physics and computer science, Collar explores the relationship between social networks and religious
transmission to explore why some religious movements succeed, while others, seemingly equally successful at a certain time, ultimately fail.
Using extensive epigraphic data, Collar provides new interpretations of the diffusion of ideas across the social networks of the Jewish Diaspora
and the cults of Jupiter Dolichenus and Theos Hypsistos, and in turn offers important reappraisals of the spread of religious innovations in the
Roman Empire. This study will be a valuable resource for students and scholars of ancient history, archaeology, ancient religion and network
theory.
This is not a book review, but rather a hearty laugh at the failure of Christianity to enter the above list. Science begins with observation and as there is
nothing of Christianity to observe, so it cannot be studied. Unless the scholar is a dupe, confidence trickster, or "of faith" (which cannot be dented by mere
science).
This makes particularly interesting, enjoyable even, to watch the estimable Hurtado wriggle and squirm attempting to explain this singular omission.
Although some modern scholars have difficulty finding "Christians" or "Christianity" before perhaps the late second or third century (or even
later), it's interesting that ancient observers seem confident that there were contemporary Christians/Christianity to criticize, and Roman
officials seem well able to lay their hands on Christians when they wished to do so (e.g., reports of Nero's pogrom in 64 CE; Pliny's letter to
Trajan ca. 112 CE; Celsus' critique of Christianity; etc.). And when you look at their descriptions and critiques, they seem to know Christianity
fairly closely to what we see in familiar early Christian texts.
(Early Christian Diversity, Larry Hurtado's Blog)
All these purported evidences I long ago treated and dismissed. In fact, I would not have made any of my study public if I could not - my beginning was the
list offered by the Vatican. Here's one such dismissal from 2012: Pliny correspondence with Trajan: Christians or Chrestians
The academic study of Christian origins relies on texts:
I noted the striking differences between the kind of evidence we have for early Christianity in comparison with other Roman-era religious
groups. In the example from Collar's book (and we could multiply it), we have a body of inscriptions, but scant textual data. In the case of early
Christianity, we have no inscriptions till the 3rd century (and then only a limited number and from few geographical locations), whereas we have
a torrent of literary texts composed in the first three centuries. (Consider, for example, the ten volumes of the classic set, The Ante-Nicene
Fathers, for a readily available sample... and it's only that.) So, why this difference, and what does it reflect?
(Early Christianity was Different (in the Roman-era context) Larry Hurtado's Blog)
These manuscripts are not historical - i.e. contemporaneous - but by anonymous monks writing at an unknown but much later date, in unknown monastic
scriptoria. This is the textual tradition and I attribute its start to Alquin of York with the authority of Charles I, founder of the Holy Roman Empire
Alcuin, inventor of Christianity
Alcuin and fraud on a monumental scale
Alcuin of York - a recapitulaton
Where are the ORIGINAL manuscripts?
If this identification is wrong, then the fraud began with the Greek manuscripts.
The fraud is of two parts:
1. Inventing authors and manuscripts of Classical Antiquity. One notable example: Eusebius of Caesarea as myth
2. Altering, usually by interpolation, genuinely-historical manuscripts, such as those of Josephus.
Nobody either can, or is willing to, tell what happened to the manuscripts that were copied (and altered); we are left to speculate. If the copies survived, so
must at least some of those the monks copied, and yet, nothing. Scholarship does not even attempt to offer an answer to this profound question, poor dears.
