Introduction
HE ancient Near East, until about a century ago, had as its chief witness the text of the Hebrew Bible. Relatively insignificant was the evidence recovered from sources outside the Bible; that which had been found had not been sufficiently understood to serve as a reliable historical source. Through explorations and excavations carried on within the last century in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and Syria, a wealth of new information has become available. This new light from extrabiblical texts has served not only to enlarge immeasurably the horizon for a knowledge of the ancient Near East, but it has also sharpened considerably the understanding of the content of the Bible itself. Not infrequently has an interest in biblical history and literature led those who pursued it into fields of discovery which have had far-reaching significance for humanistic studies in general. Hitherto unknown languages with considerable literatures have been the byproducts of activity begun by those interested primarily in biblical research. The results of the labor of those whose interest led them beyond the narrower confines have now become the tools of all biblical scholars. The purpose of this work is to make available to students of the ancient Near East—serious students of the Old Testament, we believe, are necessarily such—the most important extrabiblical texts in translations which represent the best understanding which present-day scholarship has achieved. Many of the relevant texts have been hitherto accessible only in obscure and highly technical journals. Some have been circulated widely in translations which represent a stage of understanding now happily superseded by more thorough study. Yet other texts included here have not hitherto been published in translation into a modern language. This is not the first attempt of its kind. Extrabiblical sources have long been considered important for an understanding of the Hebrew Bible. Almost three centuries ago, John Spencer, Master of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge, sought to interpret the ritual laws of the Hebrews in the light of the relevant material from Egypt, Greece, and Rome.1 As early as 1714, Hadrian Reland of Utrecht published his monumental work on Palestinian geography,1 in which he recognized the importance of the monuments for biblical study. W. Robertson Smith* and Julius Wellhausen,4 in the latter part of the nineteenth century, found in the literature of Arabia a point of vantage for a better understanding of biblical customs and institutions. The importance of Assyriology for biblical studies was widely heralded through the spectacular announcements of George Smith. In a paper read before the Society of Biblical Archaeology on December 3,1872, Smith gave translations from the Assyrian account of the flood and predicted that "we may expect many other discoveries throwing light on these ancient periods."® Two years later he described the fragments of an extrabiblical account of creation in a letter to the London Daily Telegraph.e These sensational announcements served to create interest among biblical scholars in the science of Assyriology, as well as to elicit popular support for further excavation and research. At about the same time that England was becoming aware of the significance of cuneiform studies, Eberhard Schräder published his Die Keilinschriften und das alte Testament (1872), a work which enjoyed the popularity of successive editions in German and an English translation.7 Schrader's arrangement of the relevant cuneiform material was in the form of a commeiitary upon the canonical books. Later, H. Winckler published a textbook of the cuneiform inscriptions illustrating the biblical material; this appeared in three editions.8

INTRODUCTION
«
bors can be seen to.best advantage only when there is a fairly comprehensive picture of the neighbors. Thus there has been attempted a fair sampling of the extant literature from quarters contiguous to Palestine. This broader selection of materials serves yet another purpose: it makes the collection of use to students of other phases of the history of the ancient Near East. While this is the largest collection of translations of texts relating to the Old Testament yet made, two practical considerations have limited our attainment of the goal of a truly representative selection. First, the accidents of discovery have frequently—to judge from past experience—presented anything but a representative sampling of the epigraphic material of a particular culture. Thus it may well be that certain types of literary expression from a given area have turned up in abundance, while other types of texts remain either entirely unrepresented, or with but few examples. In appraising any area or period one must keep in mind the real possibility that the sampling obtained from excavations may not necessarily be representative. Secondly, the availability of competent scholars, who could give useful translations of the known texts, has limited at a few points the selection offered in this volume. Certain areas arc represented by only a few examples of texts because of the limitations which other duties or interests imposed on the scholars best equipped to make trustworthy translations. No compromise in the quality of translation was considered worth making in the interest of achieving the ideal of a completely representative selection. It should be noted, however, that the number of competent scholars who have contributed to this project is several times more than that of those who have engaged hitherto in such an undertaking. Particularly baffling has been the problem of selecting Babylonian and Assyrian historical texts. Obviously the more important records of Babylonian and Assyrian kings mentioned in the Old Testament should be included—particularly those texts which describe campaigns conducted in Palestine and Syria. The reference in a text to a place or person known from the Bible often has been the criterion for inclusion. This selection with its index should place within ready reach the cuneiform texts containing geographical information about Syro-Palestine as it was recorded by the royal scribes of the invaders from Mesopotamia. While no claim is made for an exhaustive listing of the Palestinian place names in the records from Mesopotamia, one may expect to find here the more important references found in the texts preserved from each of the major periods of Mesopotamian history from the beginning down through the early part of the third century B.C. In addition to the specifically historical material there has been included for each major period of Mesopotamian history a representative selection of historiographic documents, as illustrations of the methods employed by the chroniclers of the names of kings, the years, and the important events in history. These texts, while obviously not relevant to the content of the Old Testament, have been considered important as background material, throwing light upon the methods of ancient historical science.
While Gressmann's Altorientalische Texte zum alten Testament has served as a basis for discussion in the making of the present choice, the selection is a new one. The editor has had the cooperation of the contributors in this task. He, rather than they, must shoulder the final responsibility for the choice made. References arc frequently given to significant discussions of the relationship of the texts to biblical passages in order that the student may form his own opinion of the relation of Israel to the surrounding world. The references in the footnotes to biblical material are intended to help the honest student, not to cajole him. It is hoped that this volume of translations, intended primarily for students of the Old Testament, will serve to give a perspective for a better understanding of the likenesses and the differences which existed between Israel and the surrounding cultures. The arrangement of the texts is according to literary types. The advantage of this order over that followed by Gressmann was first suggested by Professor Ferris J. Stephens: the greatest number of readers will approach this work from an interest in the Old Testament rather than primarily from an interest in one of the other linguistic or cultural areas. For those whose interest is regional or linguistic, there has been compiled a second table of contents listing the texts according to languages. The form of the presentation of each text aims at supplying the reader with the greatest amount

of help within the least possible space. Brief introductions are given, as a rule, to the translations. They are calculated to supply, when available, the following information: a title which indicates something of the contents of the text, the provenience, the date of composition and of the actual writing of the particular text translated, the original or official publication, important translations, references to important discussions or commentaries, and other bibliographical references which might be useful to the reader. In some cases, where the contents of the text are very obscure, a brief note of interpretation has been added. An attempt has been made to keep the introductions brief so that as many texts as possible could be included in the volume. The introduction to the text and the annotations printed in the footnotes are the work of the translator whose name appears at the beginning of the section. The general form of citation and of reference claims only the authority of general usage. At many points, what prevails as general usage in a particular discipline has been surrendered in the interest of consistency throughout the volume. Only in rare instances could the editor find such ancient authority for his demands as in the case of the numbering of every tenth line of poetry, a practice to be seen, for example, in certain cuneiform texts.14 More frequently he has had to adopt a rule and adhere to it, in spite of the good-natured taunts of the contributors. In the interest of readability the text of the translation proper has been kept as free as possible from diacritics. Normalized spellings of proper names have been employed within the translations. This means, for example, that proper names from cuneiform sources have the simple h for the A, to which cuneiformists are accustomed. Thus, every h in proper names from cuneiform texts, except those preceded by s, represents the h. Also, in the normalization of proper names the / is rendered as sh. Unless some serious misunderstanding is likely to result the differences between s and / and f, are not indicated in proper names appearing in the translations. The name of the Assyrian god AHttr has been normalized to Ashur, despite the fact that this form so widely used in English publications does not indicate the doubling of the /. Italics within the translations have been used for two purposes: first, to designate a doubtful translation of a known text; secondly, to indicate transliterations. While this second use of italics has been the general rule, in some cases it was necessary to differentiate the languages in transliterations. Here practices prevailing in the particular discipline to which the text belongs have been followed. For example, in texts where it was necessary to indicate that the transliteration was Sumerian, letter-spaced Roman was used; italic was used for the Akkadian; small capitals were used to indicate the ideogram or the cuneiform sign. In transliterations of Akkadian words diacritics have been omitted from all determinatives (indicated by superior letters).
Square brackets have been used for restorations; round brackets (parentheses) indicate interpolations made by the translator for a better understanding of the translation. Obvious scribal omissions have been placed between triangular brackets; braces indicate instances of scribal repetition of material. In the translations from Ugaritic, half square brackets have been used to designate a text which has been partly restored. A lacuna has been indicated by three dots; in case the lacuna comes before a final sentence dot, four dots appear. Following customary usage in some disciplines, a lacuna in which the text is wholly damaged or missing has been indicated in some translations by three dots enclosed within square brackets. The length of a long broken portion of text has sometimes been indicated by the translator with a statement within parentheses. Short breaks generally have not been indicated as to length; three dots may thus mean a break from as little as one sign or symbol to entire lines or passages. It has been assumed that readers who could make effective use of the information concerning the length of the missing portion of the text would be likely to have access to the original text or its transliteration.
References to the tablets, columns, lines of the text have been given usually in parentheses either within the translation, as in prose, or in the right-hand margin, when the form is poetry. Capital Roman numerals indicate the number of the tablet or some other well-recognized division; lower

case Roman numerals have been used for columns; Arabic numerals indicate the line or lines. The Egyptian hieratic texts often used rubrics for emphasis or punctuation: passages in red ink, where the general context was in black ink. The translations of these texts use small-capital letters to indicate such rubrics.
It is a source of considerable pride that there have been eleven translators who have cooperated to produce this volume. Each is a specialist within the fi?ld with which he deals. The competence of the several translators is attested by the scientific literature which they have contributed upon various problems within their respective fields. In many cases the translators have had first-hand acquaintance with the texts themselves; in every case the translator has made use of the original or scientific publication of the text which he has translated. Because of the original character of this work the contributors to the volume have frequently felt it necessary to include in the footnotes matters of considerably more technical nature than the non-specialist is likely to utilize. These notes, it is hoped, will not distract the general reader. They will be of service, where they appear, to the more specialized reader in enabling him to see the grounds for some of the newer readings and translations offered in this volume. The spirit of cooperative scholarship has been apparent throughout the four years this volume has been in preparation. On occasions it has been possible for members of the group to meet together for discussion of the various problems arising out of this collaboration. An advisory committee of three of the contributors has frequently advised the editor on problems which have arisen. The spirit of give-and-take has been evident in the willingness of each of the contributors to submit his completed manuscript to another member of the group for careful reading before publication. While each of the translators bears the sole responsibility for his work, not infrequently have criticisms given by colleagues been gratefully incorporated into the final draft.
A word should be said about the particular difficulty of finding general agreement on chronology. Each translator has been responsible for the dates found within the introductions and notes to his own contribution. Attempt has been made, however, to iron out as much of the discrepancy as possible and to offer to the reader a chronology which represents fairly widely held views. Egyptian chronology is still in a state of flux, with major uncertainty for dates before 2500 B.C. and the possibility of minor adjustment for dates after 2000 B.C. The dates suggested in this volume are tentative and are often given in terms of the nearest round number. For example, Amen-em-het III is stated to have reigned "about 1840-1790" rather than "1839-1791, with about two years' margin of error"; the Old Kingdom is dated "about 2700-!2200" rather than "about 2664-2181." For later periods there is little deviation from such standard reference works as The Cambridge Ancient History.
For the dates used in the section devoted to Babylonian and Assyrian historical texts, reference may be made to A. Poebel, The Assyrian King List from Khorsabad, JNES, n (1943), pp. 85-88. The dates as given by Poebel have been used in other places as well. Frequently references in the footnotes will direct the reader to other discussions of chronology upon which the translator has relied. One point at which this volume differs from its predecessors is the inclusion of a sizable body of translations of Hittite texts. These are scattered widely in the various sections of the volume. Since these texts have not been widely discussed as to their relation to the Old Testament, the following paragraphs will serve as orientation for the general reader. Almost all Hittite texts which we possess come from ruins near the Turkish village Bogazkoy in the center of Anatolia. The ruins represent what is left of Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite empire which flourished between 1800 and 1200 B.C. The texts are written—according to a custom which the Hittites adopted from the inhabitants of Mesopotamia—on clay tablets in cuneiform. They once belonged to "archives" or "libraries" buried under the debris when Hattusa was destroyed about

1225 B.C. This means that all of them are older than this date. A more exact date can be assigned to those which were composed by, or in the name of, specific kings. For this reason the sequence of the kings, at least for the so-called "later Hittite kingdom" may be given here:

The Bogazköy texts, the greater number of which are preserved in the museums of Istanbul and Ankara, a smaller collection being in the Vorderasiatische Abteilung of the Staatliche Museen at Berlin, have been published in various series.15 For general orientation on the Hittites and the problems connected with them the reader may be referred to the following books: A.

INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION In the preparation of the second edition each of the translators who contributed to the first edition has had opportunity not only to make corrections of mistakes and misprints, but to add to footnotes and introductions the most urgent bibliographical notations of the advancing research on the texts. T w o entirely new sections have been included: a selection of Canaanite and Aramaic Inscriptions, prepared by Franz Rosenthal, of the University of Pennsylvania; and South-Arabic Inscriptions, translated by A. lamme, of the Society of the White Fathers of Africa. An Addenda has also been added, composed of additional texts of Akkadian Myths and Epics, translated by E. A. Speiser. An index to the names in the additional materials follows the general index. The translator of the Egyptian texts has modified some of the dates used in the first edition for the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, in order to provide the needed synchronism between Akh-en-Aton and Ashur-uballit I of Assyria, who began to reign about 1356 B.C. See especially M. B. Rowton's article in JEA, xxxiv (1948), 57-74. Readers should make the following tentative adjustments in dates given below for individual reigns.

Introduction
TO THE THIRD EDITION
INCE Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament was first published in 1950, many new texts have been discovered and some of the older ones have come to be better understood. In 1955 a second, revised edition appeared with changes and corrections in the text and the addition of two new sections, Canaanite and Aramaic Inscriptions and South-Arabian Inscriptions, which were obviously relevant for the study of the Old Testament. N o w after eighteen years we have made a more extensive revision in an attempt to keep pace with new discoveries and research. Each surviving contributor to the former editions has been asked to make necessary corrections to his earlier translations, to bring the references in his annotations up to date wherever desirable, and to contribute translations of any relevant texts that have been discovered or published since the earlier selections were made. In addition to the translations from original participants the work of five new contributors appears in this volume. A. K. Grayson kindly consented to bring up to date Akkadian Myths and Epics, which had been contributed by the late E. A. Speiser. J. J. Finkelstein assumed responsibility for additional Akkadian Legal Texts, a section for which the late T. J. Meek was previously responsible, as well as for the translation of the Sumerian laws of Ur-Nammu. With the recent emergence of interest in the concept of covenant in Old Testament studies, it has seemed appropriate to include an entirely new genre of texts, Akkadian Treaties from Syria and Assyria, translated by Erica Reiner. The understanding of Akkadian Didactic and Wisdom literature has been greatly improved since the late Robert H. Pfeiffer made his translations and new material has become available. Robert D. Biggs has made entirely new translations of the texts within this section. William L. Moran, SJ. has provided translations of a number of new Akkadian letters that belong to the extensive corpus of tablets from Mari. A perusal of the Table of Contents will make it clear that not only these new contributors but a number of the former translators have labored to enlarge considerably the volume of material provided in the earlier editions. Since the additions fall neatly into the general categories and literary types of the first edition and generally supplement rather than antiquate the former translations it was apparent that they could be published in a separate volume. By it an owner of the first or the second edition can bring his collection of ancient Near Eastern texts up to date without discarding an expensive and possibly annotated volume. The third edition of ANET incorporates these additions of the Supplement and includes those line corrections which translators felt were essential. Whenever these corrections and additions could not be fitted into the line and page of the former edition they have been included in a section on Addenda with reference to the quarter of the page to which the addition applies. It is hoped that the user of the Supplement can see readily the place to which the addition or change belongs.
The additional texts of the second edition have been included in the Supplement, so that it will serve to bring up to date the first edition as well as the second. An entirely new index has been constructed for the names appearing in the book.

Egyptian Myths, Tales, and Mortuary Texts
TRANSLATOR: JOHN A. WILSON
Creation and Myths of Origins
THE CREATION BY ATOM
The following text served in the dedication ritual of a royal pyramid by recalling the first creation, when the god Atum of Heliopolis was on a primeval hillock arising out of the waters of chaos and there brought the first gods into being. In like manner, the god is now asked to bless the rising pyramid, an analogue of the hillock. The text was carved inside the pyramids of Mer-ne-Re and Pepi II (Nefer-ka-Re) of the Sixth Dynasty (24th century B.C.), from which the following translation is made. Parts of the text were popular in later times, to promote the immortality of individuals.1 The hieroglyphic text appears in K. Sethe, Die altagyptischen Pyramidentexten, 11 (Leipzig, 1910), §1652-56. Extracts from the whole utterance have occasionally been translated, for example, J. H. Breasted, Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt (New York, 1912), 76 f * (See Addenda).
O Atum-Kheprer, thou wast on high on the (primeval) hill; thou didst arise as the ben-hud of the benstone in the 5<r«-House in Heliopolis;2 thou didst spit out what was Shu, thou didst sputter out what was Tefnut.* Thou didst put thy arms about them as the arms of a for thy J(a was in them.4 (So also), O Atum, put thou thy arms about King Nefer-ka-Re, about this construction work, about this pyramid, as the arms of a l(a. For the l(a of King Neferka-Re is in it, enduring for the course of eternity. O Atum, mayest thou set thy protection over this King Nefer-ka-Re, over this his pyramid and this construction work of King Nefer-ka-Re. Mayest thou guard lest anything happen to him evilly throughout the course of eternity, as thou didst set thy protection over Shu and Tefnut. 0 Great Ennead which is in Heliopolis, Atum, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Seth, and Nephthys,5 whom Atum begot, spreading wide his heart (in joy) at
1 For example, it appears in the 13th century B.C., in extracts, in Papyrus Chester Bcatty IX, recto, viii 3-21 (Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Third Series. Chester Beatty Gift, ed. by A. H. Gardiner, Vol. 1 [London, 1935], 91). 1 The god of Heliopolis was compounded of two phases of the sun, Atum and Kheprer (later Atum and Re). The sanctuary at Heliopolis had a stone of sacred recognition. Associated with this stone was a bird, which was much later to be taken as the phoenix. This part of the texts is full of plays on words, such as weben "arise," and ben-bird, etc. * The creation of Shu, god of air, and of Tefnut, goddess of moisture, was as explosive as a sneeze, cf. p. 6 below. 4 The k* was the alter ego, or the guardian spirit, or—perhaps betterthe vital force of a personality. Pktorially it was depicted as the sheltering arms. The creator-god Atum put his own vital force into his first creatures. " T h e first nine gods, the Great Ennead, are here given, in their four generations: ( 1 ) Atum, the creator; (2) Shu, god of air, and Tefnut, goddess of moisture; (3) Geb, god of earth, and Nut, goddess of the sky; (4) the god Osiris and the goddess Isis; the god Seth and the goddess Nephthys. cf. p. 6 below.
his begetting (you) in your name of the Nine Bows,6 may there be none of you who will separate himself from Atum, as he protects this King Nefer-ka-Re, as he protects this pyramid of King Nefer-ka-Re, as he protects this his construction work—from all gods and from all dead, and as he guards lest anything happen to him evilly throughout the course of eternity.
ANOTHER VERSION OF THE CREATION BY ATUM
An ancient Egyptian's title to eternal happiness was often asserted by associating him with various superhuman forces, including the greatest gods of the land. Thus he secured their invincible immortality. The following extract from the popular 17th chapter of the Book of the Dead sets the deceased Egyptian in juxtaposition with the creator-god Atum, implicitly securing renewed creation of life. This text was used all over Egypt for many centuries. The following translation is taken from the Eighteenth to TwentyFirst Dynasties version of the Book of the Dead (1500-1000 B.C.). The text goes back at least as far as the Middle Kingdom (2000 B.C.), when it was inscribed in the coffins of nobles. By the Eighteenth Dynasty, the text had been amplified with explanatory and confirmatory glosses. The current translation of the opening lines of the 17th chapter is made from H. Grapow, Religiöse Urkunden (Ur\. v, Leipzig, 1915-17), 4-13, including a translation into German. Translations into English are needed for the Book of the Dead* A rendering into German will be found in G. Roeder, Urkunden zur Religion des alten Aegypten (Jena, 1923), 237 ff.

Who is he ? This "Re, when he began to rule that which he had made" means that Re began to appear as a king, as one who was before the liftings of Shu had taken place,6 when he was on the hill which is in Hermopolis.7 "I am the great god who came into being by himself." Who is he ? "The great god who came into being by himself" is water; he is Nun, the father of the gods. Another version: He is Re. "He who created his names, the Lord of the Ennead." Who is he ? He is Re, who created the names of the parts of his body. That is how these gods who follow him came into being.8 "I am he among the gods who cannot be repulsed." Who is he ? He is Atum, who is in his sun disc. Another version: He is Re, when he arises on the eastern horizon of heaven." "I am yesterday, while I know tomorrow." Who is he ? As for "yesterday," that is Osiris. As for "tomorrow," that is Re on that day on which the enemies of the All-Lord are annihilated and his son Horus is made ruler.10...
THE THEOLOGY OF MEMPHIS
When the First Dynasty established its capital at Memphis, it was necessary to justify the sudden emergence of this town to central importance. The Memphite god Ptah was therefore proclaimed to have been the First Principle, taking precedence over other recognized creator-gods. Mythological arguments were presented that the city of Memphis was the "place where the T w o Lands are united" and that the Temple of Ptah was the "balance in which Upper and Lower Egypt have been weighed." The extracts presented here are particularly interesting, because creation is treated in an intellectual sense, whereas other creation stories (like pp. 3-4 above) are given in purely physical terms. Here the god Ptah conceives the elements of the universe with his mind ("heart") and brings them into being by his commanding speech ("tongue"). Thus, at the beginning of Egyptian history, there was an approach to the Logos Doctrine. The extant form of this document dates only to 700 B.C., but linguistic, philological, and geopolitical evidence is conclusive in support of its derivation from an original text more than two thousand years older. The so-called "Shabaka Stone" is No. 498 in the British Museum. It was published by S. Sharpe, Egyptian Inscriptions from the British Museum and Other Sources (London, 1837), 1, Pis. 36-38. The first understanding of its contents was that of J. H. Breasted, in ZAeS, xxxix (1901), 39-54, followed by A. Erman, Ein Den\mal memphitischer Theologie (SPAW, 1911,
6 Before the air-god Shu had lifted heaven apart from earth. 7 Atum-Re began his creation upon a primeval hillock arising out of the abysmal waters, Nun. In this version this hillock is located in the ancient cult-center of Hermopolis. Any important cult-center was regarded by the Egyptians as potentially a place of creation and therefore had its own hill of creation, symbolized in its holy of holies, cf. pp. 3; 8; 31, n.10. 8 The first utterance of a name is an act of creation. When Atum-Re named the parts of his body, his Ennead, the nine gods of his immediate family, came into being. 9 The eternally rising sun cannot be destroyed. 10 The "yesterday" of death is associated with Osiris, the god of the dead. The "tomorrow" of rebirth is associated with the ever-rising sun and with the accession of Horus to the rule of his father Osiris. The continuation of the text is not translated here.

Junker, Die Götterlehre von Memphis (APAW, 1939, Nr. 23, Berlin, 1940). The present part of the text has been studied by J. H. Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience (New York, 1933), 29-42, and in H. Frankfort et al., The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man (Chicago, 1946), 55-60.

(48) The gods who came into being as Ptah:—10
Ptah who is upon the Great Throne . . . ; Ptah-Nun, the father who [begot] Atum; Ptah-Naunet, the mother who bore Atum; Ptah the Great, that is, the heart and tongue of the Ennead; [Ptah]... who gave birth to the g o d s ; . .
(53) There came into being as the heart and there came into being as the tongue (something) in the form of Atum. The mighty Great One is Ptah, who transmitted [life to all gods], as well as (to) their ^a's, through this heart, by which Horus became Ptah, and through this tongue, by which Thoth became Ptah.12 (Thus) it happened that the heart and tongue gained control over [every] (other) member of the body, by teaching that he18 is in every body and in every mouth of all gods, all men, [all] cattle, all creeping things, and (everything) that lives, by thinking and commanding everything that he wishes. (55) His Ennead is before him in (the form of) teeth and lips. That is (the equivalent of) the semen and hands of Atum. Whereas the Ennead of Atum came into being by his semen and his fingers, the Ennead (of Ptah), however, is the teeth and lips in this mouth, which pronounced the name of everything, from which Shu and Tefnut came forth, and which was the fashioner of the Ennead.14
The sight of the eyes, the hearing of the ears, and the smelling the air by the nose, they report to the heart. It is this which causes every completed (concept) to come forth, and it is the tongue which announces what the heart thinks.15
7 The crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt. 8 The province (nome) of Memphis was named "White Wall." 9 The intertwining tutelary plants of Upper and Lower Egypt, the reed(?) and the papyrus, symbolize the reconciliation of the two parts of Egypt and of their gods. 10 Or, with Junker: "who have (their) form in Ptah." 11 Three other forms of Ptah appear in badly broken context These forms of Ptah apply to the statement that follows. Ptah was both Nun, the abysmal waters, and his consort Naunet, and in these capacities he brought forth Atum, the creator-god of the Heliopolitan theology. 12 Ptah thought of and created by speech the creator-god Atum ( " T o tality"), thus transmitting the divine power of Ptah to all other gods. The gods Horus and Thoth, a commonly associated pair, are equated with the organs of thought and speech.
13 Ptah, as heart and tongue.
14 A distinction is made between the act of creation by Atum through onanism (cf. p. 6 below) and the creation by Ptah through commanding speech with teeth and lips. Pronouncing a name was creative. Shu and Tefnut were the first deities to be spoken.
15 The senses report to the heart. With this reported material, the

Thus all the gods were formed and his Ennead was completed. Indeed, all the divine order16 really came into being through what the heart thought and the tongue commanded. Thus the ^«-spirits were made and the hemsut-spiiits were appointed, they who make all provisions and all nourishment, by this speech. (Thus justice was given to) him who does what is liked, {and injustice to) him who does what is disliked.17 Thus life was given to him who has peace and death was given to him who has sin. Thus were made all work and all crafts, the action of the arms, the movement of the legs, and the activity of every member, in conformance with (this) command which the heart thought, which came forth through the tongue, and which gives value to everything.18
(Thus) it happened that it was said of Ptah: "He who made all and brought the gods into being." He is indeed Ta-tenen, who brought forth the gods, for everything came forth from him, nourishment and provisions, the offerings of the gods, and every good thing. Thus it was discovered and understood that his strength is greater than (that of the other) gods. And so Ptah was satisfied,19 after he had made everything, as well as all the divine order.20 He had formed the gods, he had made cities, he had founded nomes, he had put the gods in their shrines, (60) he had established their offerings, he had founded their shrines, he had made their bodies like that (with which) their hearts were satisfied. So the gods entered into their bodies of every (kind of) wood, of every (kind of) stone, of every (kind of) clay, or anything which might grow upon him,21 in which they had taken form. So all the gods, as well as their ^«'s gathered themselves to him, content and associated with the Lord of the T w o Lands.
The Great Seat, which rejoices the heart of the gods, which is in the House of Ptah, the mistress of all life, is the Granary of the God,22 through which the sustenance of the T w o Lands is prepared,23 because of the fact that Osiris drowned in his water, while Isis and Nephthys watched. They saw him and they were distressed at him. Horus commanded Isis and Nephthys repeatedly that they lay hold on Osiris and prevent his drowning. (63) They turned (their) heads in time. So they brought him to land.24 He entered the mysterious portals in the glory of the lords of eternity, in the steps of him who
heart conceives and releases thought, which the tongue, as a herald, puts into effective utterance. 18 Literally, "every word of the god." 1T Following previous translators, we supply something which seems to have dropped out of the text. The exact words are uncertain. 18 "The dignity (or worth or reverence) of everything." " Or, "so Ptah rested." 20 cf. n.16 above. 21 Upon Ptah, in his form of the "rising land." Note that divine images were not the gods themselves, but only places in which they might assume appearance. 22 The determinative shows that "the God" was Ptah Ta-tenen. 28 The temple of Ptah at Memphis was called the "Great Seat," or throne, and the granary which kept Egypt alive. 24 The rescue of Osiris, the grain-god, from drowning is given in explanation of the position of Memphis as the granary of E g y p t In the following context, one must understand that Osiris's son was Horus and that Horus was the king of Egypt Hence Horus was correctly located at Memphis.

shines forth on the horizon, on the ways of Re in the Great Seat. He joined with the court and associated with the gods of Ta-tenen Ptah, the lord of years. Thus Osiris came to be in the land in the "House of the Sovereign" on the north side of this land, which he had reached. His son Horus appeared as King of Upper Egypt and appeared as King of Lower Egypt, in the embrace of his father Osiris, together with the gods who were in front of him and who were behind him. THE REPULSING OF THE DRAGON AND THE CREATION
This text employed myth for ritual and magical recitation. In Egyptian belief the ship of the sun-god Re made a journey through the skies above by day and the skies below by night. Every night this ship faced the peril of destruction from a demon lurking in the underworld, Apophis. An important part of the ritual of Egyptian temples was the repulsing of this dragon, and thus the repulsing of the perils which might face nation or people. The following ritual is an extract from a papyrus containing a group of texts, for which the general heading is:
" T H E BEGINNING OF T H E BOOK OF OVERTHROWING APOPHIS, THE
E N E M Y OF Re AND THE E N E M Y OF King Wen-nofer—life, prosperity, health!—the justified, performed in the course of every day in the Temple of Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, Presiding over Karnak."1 The particular interest of the section given below is that it adds to these spells against Apophis a statement about creation.
The text is preserved in the Papyrus Bremner-Rhind (British Museum 10188), which may have come from Thebes. The present manuscript is dated about 310 B.C., but the text makes a deliberate attempt to preserve a language two thousand years older than that date. There is no doubt that the basic material derives from a relatively early period. Photographic facsimiles of the papyrus were published by Budge in Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. First Series (London, 1910), Pis. I-XIX. Faulkner gave a transcription from hieratic into hieroglyphic in The Papyrus Bremner-Rhind (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, 111, Brussels, 1933). The latest study and translation of the entire papyrus was given by Faulkner in JEA, xxii (1936), 121 β.; xxiii (1937), 10 flf., 166 flf.; xxiv (1938), 41 flf.; with the section below (xxvi 21—xxviii 20) treated in xxm, 172 if.

T planned in my own heart, and there came into being a multitude of forms of beings, the forms of children and the forms of their children. I was the one who copulated with my fist, I masturbated (xxvii 1) with my hand. Then I spewed with my own mouth:81 spat out what was Shu, and I sputtered out what was Tefnut. It was my father Nun who brought them up, and my Eye followed after them since the ages when they were distant from me.9 After I had come into being as the sole god, there were three gods beside me.101 came into being in this land, whereas Shu and Tefnut rejoiced in Nun, in which they were. They brought to me my Eye with them. After I had joined together my members, I wept over them.11 That is how men came into being from the tears which came forth from my Eye. It was angry with me, after it returned and found that I had made another in its place, having replaced it with the Glorious Eye, which I had made. Then I advanced its place on my head,12 and after it had ruled this entire land, its rage fell away to its roots, for I had replaced what had been taken away from it. I came forth from the roots," and I created all creeping things and whatever lives among them. Then Shu and Tefnut brought forth (5) Geb and Nut. Then Geb and Nut brought forth Osiris, Horus Khenti-en-irti, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys from the body, one of them after another; and they brought forth their multitudes in this land.14 When (these gods) rich in magic spoke, it was the
5 There is a play on the name Nun, the primordial waters in which creation took place, and nenu "the weary," usually a designation of the dead, but here those in inchoate pause. "Other texts locate the creation on a primeval hillock arising out of the waters of Nun. cf. pp. 3, 4, and 8. 7 The first two children of the creator-god were Shu, the air-god, and Tefnut, the goddess of moisture. The statement of their ejection into being contains plays on the words ishesh "spit" and Shu, and tef "sputter" and Tefnut. cf. p. 3 above. 8 There is here a fusion of two myths, creation by self-pollution and creation by ejection from the mouth, cf. p. 5 above. 9 Reference to another myth, in which, however, it was Shu and Tefnut who went out after the wandering Eye of Re. See H. Junker, Die Onurislegende (Vienna, 1917). 10 Nun, Shu, and Tefnut. 11 Apparently Re wept when he found that his Eye was missing from his body. He made a substitute eye, which displeased his missing Eye when it returned to him. The labored point of the context is a play on the words remit "tears," and romet "mankind," in explanation of human creation, cf. pp. 8a, n.6; 11, n.6; 366, n.17. 12 Re appeased his wrathful Eye by making it the uraeus on his brow, the symbol of rule. 18 An obscure or corrupt statement on the creation of vegetation. In the next sentence, the "among them" may refer to plant life. 14 Shu and Tefnut, the children of Atum-Re, were miraculously brought into being. But their children, Geb (earth) and Nut (sky), were normally born "from the body," as were also the divine children of Geb and Nut. Thus we have the Ennead, the nine ruling gods, with Horus as an added member, cf. p. 3 above. The context now continues by pointing out how these created beings were to use their magic against the demon enemy of Re.

ALL MEN CREATED EQUAL IN OPPORTUNITY
The Middle Kingdom was a period in which social justice and the rights of the common man were emphasized. The text which follows purports to give the words of the creator-god in making all men equal in access to the basic necessities of life. The text is inscribed on four wooden coffins from el-Bersheh in Middle Egypt and dates to the Middle Kingdom (2000 B.C.). Thus far, it is known only from that period. The hieroglyphic text is as yet unpublished, except for the reference and translation given by J. H. Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience (New York, 1933), 221 f. It will be published in the volumes by A. de Buck, The Egyptian Coffin Texts (OIP). The present translation was made from photographs for Coffin B3C (Cairo Museum 28085) and B6C (Cairo 28094) anc*part—BiC (Cairo 28083). The text also appears on B1B0 (Boston Museum 20.1822-27)? (Sec Addenda). Other texts below deal with creation and origins. For example, Amon as creator is presented in the text of pp. 368-369, Aton as creator in pp. 370-371. Other myths of origins deal with the founding of the city of Tanis (pp. 252-253) or the setting up of an estate of a god (pp. 31-32).
The All-Lord says in the presence of those stilled from tumult on the journey of the court:1 "Pray, be prosperous in peace! I repeat for you four good deeds which my own heart did for me in the midst of the serpent-coil, in order to still evil.21 did four good deeds within the portal of the horizon.8 "I made the four winds that every man might breathe thereof li\e his fellow in his time. That is (one) deed thereof.
21 These instructions for the manual activity accompanying the recitation show that the interest of the exorcism is the application of magic against the dragon-demon to the damnation of the enemies of the pharaoh.
1 In the entourage of the sun-god on the daily journey of his barque arc the dead who have been released from the cares of this world. 2 Creation is a sort of release from involvement. Here the creator-god. who is also the sun-god, has freed himself from the serpent-dragon which threatened his daily journey; see pp. 6-7 above. Apparently, the god's good deeds were the means of his release, stilling the evil of the serpent by stilling inequality in this world. 3 That is, at dawn or at the beginning.

THEBES AS THE PLACE OF CREATION
Every important cult-center of Egypt asserted its primacy by the dogma that it was the site of creation. The following is an extract from a long hymn extolling Thebes and its god AmonRe. It is dated shortly after the Amarna Revolution and is a renewed confirmation of Theban domination. The manuscript is dated to the reign of Ramses II (about 1301-1234 B.C.). The hieratic text of Leyden Papyrus I 350 was published by C. Leemans, Monumens igyptiens du music d'antiquitis dcs Pays-Bas h Leide (Leyden, 1841-82), 11, Pis. CUX-CLXIII. The text was studied by A. H . Gardiner in ZAeS, XLII (1905), 12-42, and by A. Erman, Der Leidener Amonshymnus ( S P A W , 1923, 62-81). It is translated in Erman, LAE, 293-302.

Thebes is normal beyond every (other) city. The water and land were in her from the first times. (Then) (ii 11) sand came to delimit the fields and to create her ground on the hillock; (thus) earth came into being.* Then men came into being in her, to found every city with her real name, for their name is called "city" (only) under the oversight of Thebes, the Eye of Re." Her majesty came as the Sound Eye and the Beneficial Eye,4 to bind the land thereby together with (her) \ay coming to rest and alighting in Ishru in her form as Sekhmet, the Mistress of the T w o Lands.5 "How rich
4 The juxtaposition of this statement of god's equalitarian creation and this statement of man's disobedience of god's command means that m a n and not god—is responsible for social inequality. s The pious service of local gods would provide credit for continued life in the West, the realm of the dead. This idea is related to the equalitarian statements which precede it. By the Middle Kingdom, the full and powerful afterlife, which had previously been the prerogative of kings alone, had been extended to all worthy men and might be won locally, without attachment to the royal court. ' T h e nomes" were the Egyptian provinces. 6 There arc two puns: fedu "four" and fedet "sweat"; and romet "men" and remit "tears." cf. p. 6, n . n above. In somewhat uncertain terms there is a relation of the creation of gods to the creation of humans, both exudations of the creator-god. The attempt is clumsy, because one pun calls for four gods, instead of the usual nine. These may be the four gods who assist the dead man on his arrival in the next world (e.g. K. Sethe, Die dtagyptischen Pyramidentexte, n, $1456-57).
1 The manuscript is divided into a series of numbered "houses," i.e. "chapters" or "stanzas." The present stanza is ii 10-15 of the papyrus. Each stanza begins and ends with a pun based on the number. Here the word med "ten" is picked up by the word meter, which probably means "normal" or "standard." 2 Thus the primeval hillock, upon which creation took place, is located in Thebes, cf. pp. 3-4 above. s One designation of Thebes was "The City" (biblical No), resulting in this curious claim that all other cities were permitted to use that tide under her domination. 4 Allusion to the myth of the restored eye of the sun-god. 5 Ishru, near Karnak, was a cult-seat of the goddess Mut, here equated vith the goddess Sekhmet.

She is the norm.
THE ASSIGNMENT OF FUNCTIONS TO THOTH
The Egyptians, like the Hebrews, were fond of punning explanations of names and phenomena. The following text provides the explanation of a number of cosmological or mythological phenomena. The sun-god Re here assigns responsibility for the moon to the god Thoth, who thus becomes die "placetaker" for the sun, an adjutant of the gods. The text is found on the Tut-ankh-Amon shrine, now in the Cairo Museum, and in the Theban tombs of Seti I, Ramses II, and Ramses III. It thus ranges from the middle of the 14th century to the middle of the 12th century B.C. However, its original was probably much earlier. The parallel texts are presented by Ch. Maystre in BIT AO, XL (1941), 93-98. The line numbers, 62-74, follow the Seti I version. There is a translation in G. Roeder, Ur\unden zur Religion des alten Aegyptens (Jena, 1923), 147-48* (Sec Addenda).
Then the majesty of this god1 said: "Pray, summon to me Thoth!" Then he was brought immediately. Then the majesty of this god said to Thoth: "Behold ye,* I am here in the sky in my (proper) place. Inasmuch as I (65) shall act so that the light may shine in the Underworld and the Island of Baba,8 thou shalt be scribe there and keep in order those who are in them,4 those who may perform deeds of rebellion... against me, (70) the followers of this dissatisfied being.* Thou shalt be in my place, a place-taker. Thus thou shalt be called: 'Thoth, the place-taker of Re.' Moreover, (I) shall have thee tread upon those greater than thou." That is how the ibis of Thoth came into being.® "Moreover, I shall have thee stretch out thy hand7 in the face of the primeval gods, who are greater than thou. My speech is good, if thou actest (so)." That is how the ibis of Thoth came into being.8 "Moreover, I shall have thee encompass the two heavens with thy beauty and with thy rays." That is how the moon of Thoth came into being."
8 Pun: weser "rich" and waset "Thebes." 7 "Opposite-her-Lord" (Le. Amon) was an epithet of Thebes. "Appointed-of-Places" was the name of the Temple of Karnak.
1 Re. * Re's commands are for all the attendant gods. 8 An otherwise unknown designation for a part of the Underworld. It may mean a subterranean cavern. 4 Re cannot do full justice to the denizens of the world and to the denizens of the Underworld. Since he feels a responsibility to illumine the latter, he assigns the moon, Thoth, to be his deputy there. 5 A corrupt passage. In the first part there may be reference to mankind's rebellion, as in the passage on the destruction of mankind, pp. 1 0 - n . The second part may refer to the Apophis demon, the enemy of the sungod; cf. pp. 6-7, 11-12. 6 A play on words: hab: "tread upon" and tub "ibis" the bird sacred to Thoth. 7 In command. The gods of primeval chaos were associated with the underworld. 8 Another play on words: hhen "speech" and tekheni, another term for the ibis.
9 Another play on words: inch "encompass" and iah "moon."

THE PRIMEVAL
ESTABLISHMENT OF ORDER
A responsibility of the creator-god Atum was to bring the world into order and to assign places and functions. The conquest of hostile forces and the delimitation of the next world are themes of the following text. Insofar as it deals with the place and functions of Osiris, it has been used as a magic spell for the preservation of the dead man, himself an Osiris.1 Here translated from the 175th chapter of the Book of the Dead, as in the Eighteenth Dynasty (1550-1350 B.C.) Papyrus of Ani (British Museum 10470; The Papyrus of Ani, ed. by E. A. W. Budge [London, 1913], in, Sheet 29).

"O Thoth, what is it that has happened ? It is among the children of Nut* They have made an uproar; they have seized upon quarreling; they have done evil deeds; they have created rebellion; they have made slaughterings; (5) they have created imprisonment. Moreover, in everything which we might do, they have made the great into the small. Give thou greatly, Thoth!" Thus spoke Atum.
Thoth's Reply
"Thou shalt not see (such) evil deeds, thou shalt not suffer, (for) their years are cut short and their months are curbed, inasmuch as the destruction of hidden things was made for them through all that thou hast done."3

1 Hie concept was originally related to the kingship, the dead pharaoh becoming Osiris, while his son and successor became Horus. 2 That is, among the partisans of Seth, who was the "son of Nut." 8 This seems to be the answer of Thoth, assuring Atum that the punishment of evil resides in the system which Atum created. * By identifying himself with the scribal equipment of Thoth, the deceased dissociates himself from the rebellious beings. 5 The deceased asks the creator-god to describe the land of burial.
AND MORTUARY TEXTS 9
Atum's Answer
"It has no water, it has no air—deep, deep, dark, dark, boundless, boundless—in which thou livest in the peace of heart of the silent land. Sexual pleasures are not enjoyed in it, (but) a blessed state® is given to (thee)7 in recompense for water, air, and sexual pleasure, and peace of heart in recompense for bread and beer." Thus spoke Atum.
Protest of the Deceased
"In the sight of thy face? Indeed, I cannot bear the lack of thee!8 Every (other) god has assumed his place in the forefront of (the sun barque) Millions-of-Years!"
Atum's Reply
"Thy place belongs to thy son Horus"—thus spoke Atum—"Indeed, it shall be that he sends forth the great, (15) while he also shall rule thy place, and he shall inherit the throne which is in the Island of Flame.9 It is further decreed that a man shall see his fellow, (so that) my face shall see thy face."10
Question of the Deceased, as Osiris
"O Atum, what is (my) duration of life?"—thus he spoke.
Atum's Answer
"Thou art (destined) for millions of millions (of years), a lifetime of millions. I have caused that he send out the great ones.11 Further, I shall destroy all that I have made, and this land will return into Nun, into the floodwaters, as (in) its first state.18 I (alone) am a survivor, together with Osiris, when I have made my form in another state, serpents which men do not know and gods do not see.18 "How good is what I have done for Osiris, distinct from all (other) gods! I have given (20) him the desert, the silent land, with his son Horus as heir upon his throne which is in the Island of Flame. Further, I have made his place in the barque of Millions-of-Years. Horus remains upon his throne, for the purpose of founding his monuments also. The soul of Seth has been sent apart from all (other) gods, because I have caused the restraint of his soul, which is in the (sun) barque, because he wishes to fear the divine body."14
8 A\h, a state of "effective being," or "beatitude." I Text: "to me." 8 Osiris—here in the person of the deceased—is being assigned to the region of the dead. He objects that he will not see the face of the sun there. In the reply Atum offers' him compensations. 9 The place where the sun was born at dawn. 10 The last sentences uncertain, since the literal runs: "Further it is decreed that I see his fellow, my face to see the face of the lord." Atum seems to promise Osiris that they two will not be cut off from each other, even though Horus takes over die rule of his father in the upper world. II So literally, but uncertain of meaning and perhaps corrupt. 12 Atum's purpose in destroying his creation and returning it to primeval chaos is not stated here. It probably has to do with the same kind of a
destruction of mankind as in the text of pp. 10-11 below. The point here is that Osiris, in the realm of the dead, escapes such destruction. 1S Atum, "Totality," included the gods of primeval chaos, who were depicted in serpent form. 14 Atum assures Osiris that the latter need not fear his enemy Seth, because Seth is sufficiently under the authority of the supreme god to

THE MYTHOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF CERTAIN UNCLEAN ANIMALS
The Egyptians viewed certain animals as devoted for a definite purpose and therefore taboo for other purposes, specifically as unclean for eating. The following text is a mythological explanation of a taboo against eating pork. Not all of the text is clear, but it does involve two well-known elements: the conflict of Horus and Seth for the rule, and a damage to one of Horus' eyes, which were the two heavenly luminaries. The text first occurs in the coffins of the Middle Kingdom, from which it is here translated, and is continued into the Book of the Dead, being used for many centuries. The hieroglyphic text is given by A. de Buck, The Egyptian Coffin Texts, 11 ( O I P , XLIX, Chicago, 1938), Spell 157, pp. 326 if. It later became the 112th chapter of the Book of the Dead and is studied and translated by K . Sethe et al. in ZAeS (1923), LVIII, 1 ff.#One Middle Kingdom coffin, which treats Spells 157 and 158 consecutively without break, has an instruction at the end of Spell 158: "Not to be spoken while eating pork."1

The Myth
It was Re—he said to Horus: "Pray, let me see thy eye since this has happened to it."4 Then he saw it. He said: "Pray, look at that (black.) part, while thy hand is a covering over the sound eye which is there."5 Then Horus looked at that (blac\) part. Then Horus said: "Now I see it quite white." That is how the oryx came into being.® Then Re said: "Pray, look another time at that black pig."7 Thereupon Horus looked at this pig. Thereupon Horus shrieked because of the state of his eye, which was stormy.8 He said: "Behold, my eye is as (at) that first blow which Seth made against my eye!" Thereupon Horus swallowed his heart before him.9 Then Re said: "Put ye him upon his bed until he has recovered." It was Seth—he had assumed form against him as a black pig; thereupon he shot a blow into his eye. Then Re said: "The pig is an abomination to Horus." "Would that he might recover!" said the gods.
T H A T IS HOW THE PIG BECAME AN ABOMINATION TO THE
GODS, AS W E L L AS THEIR FOLLOWERS, FOR H o R U s ' SAKE.10 . . .
Deliverance of Mankind from Destruction
The themes of this myth afe the sin of mankind, the destructive disappointment of their creator, and the deliverance of mankind from annihilation. However, the setting of the present text shows that its purpose was magical protection rather than moral teaching. On the walls of three royal tombs of the Empire, it accompanies certain charms to protect the body of the dead ruler. This implies that the former deliverance of mankind from destruction will, be valid also in this individual case.
The text appears on the walls of the tombs of Seti I, Ramses II, and Ramses III at Thebes. Its date is thus I4th-i2th centuries B.C., although the language used and the corrupted state of the text show that it followed an older original. The texts were published together by Ch. Maystre in BIFAO, XL (1941), 53-73. T h e line numbers below are those of the Seti I version. There is a translation in Erman, LAE, 47-49* Other reference to man's rebelliousness and the god's punishment of men will be found in pp. 8-10, 417.
4Horus*s eye was injured in the fight with Seth for the rule. The destroyed and restored eye came to be identified with the moon. 5 Following the reasoning of Sethe, an old sign for "black" has degenerated into a mere stroke, following the word for "part" or "mark." It is not clear how Horus, covering his uninjured eye, could see the injury in his wounded eye. 6 Homonyms, ma - hedj "see-white" and ma-hedj "oryx." The oryx was a beast of Seth, and thus also unclean to Horus. The sense of the passage must be that Horus failed to see what Re saw. 7 The words "another time" perhaps mean that Re directed Horus' attention to the same black mark, but with a more specific statement that the mark of injury looked like a pig, Seth's beast. 8 Probably inflamed. 9 In view of what follows, this must mean that Horus lost consciousness in Re's presence. 10 More literally: "that is how the pig became abominated for Horus by the gods, like their followers," all rubricized. The omitted conclusion of the myth states that the pig had previously been a sacrificial animal for Horus and relates the myth about Horus to the Souls of Buto, with whom the deceased is so well acquainted.



EGYPTIAN MYTHS, TALES,

It happened t h a t . . . Re, the god who came into being by himself, when he was king of men and gods all together. Then mankind plotted something in the (very) presence of Re. Now then, his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—was old. His bones were of silver, his flesh of gold, and his hair of genuine lapis lazuli. Then his majesty perceived the things which were being plotted against him by mankind. Then his majesty—life, prosperity, health! said to those who were in his retinue: "Pray, summon to me my Eye,1 Shu, Tefnut, Geb, and Nut, as well as the fathers and mothers who were with me when I was in Nun,2 as well »as my god Nun also. He is to bring his court (5) with him. Thou shalt bring them secretly, let not mankind see; let not their hearts escape.® Thou shalt come with them to the Great House, that tiiey may tell their plans, since the [times] when I came from Nun to the place in which I came into being."4 Then these gods were brought in, and these gods [came] beside him, putting their heads to the ground in the presence of his majesty, so that he might make his statement in the presence of the father of the eldest, he who made mankind, the king of people.5 Then they said in the presence of his majesty: "Speak to us, so that we may hear it." Then Re said to Nun: "O eldest god, in whom I came into being, O ancestor gods, behold mankind, which came into being from my Eye6—they have plotted things against me. Tell me what ye would do about it Behold, I am seeking; I would not slay them until I had heard what (10) ye might say about it." Then the majesty of Nun said: "My son Re, the god greater than he who made him and mightier than they who created him, sitting upon thy throne, the fear of thee is great when thy Eye is (directed) against them who scheme against thee!" Then the majesty of Re said: "Behold, they have fled into the desert, their hearts being afraid because I might speak to them." Then they said in the presence of his majesty: "May thy Eye be sent, that it may catch for thee them who scheme with evil things. (But) the Eye is not {sufficiently) prominent therein to smite them for thee.7 It should go down as Hat-Hor." So then this goddess came and slew mankind in the desert. Then the majesty of this god said: "Welcome, Hat-Hor, who hast done for me the deed for which I came\" Then this goddess said: "As thou livest for me,8 I have prevailed over mankind, and it is pleasant in my heart!"

is how Sekhmet came into being, the (beer)-mash of the night, to wade in their blood from Herakleopolis.10 Then Re said: "Pray, summon to me swift and speedy messengers, so that they may run like the shadow of a body." Then these messengers were brought immediately. Then the majesty of this god said: "Go ye to Elephantine and bring me red ochre very abundantly."11 Then this red ochre was brought to him. Then the majesty of this great god caused .. ., [and He-With]the-Side-Lock who is in Heliopolis12 ground up this red ochre. When further maidservants crushed barley to (make) beer, then this red ochre was added to this mash. Then (it) was like human blood. Then seven thousand jars of the beer were made. So then the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Re came, together with these gods, to see this beer. Now when day broke for (20) the slaying of mankind by the goddess at their season of going upstream,18 then the majesty of Re said: "How good it is! I shall protect mankind with it!" Then Re said: "Pray, carry it to the place in which she expected to slay mankind." Then the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Re went to work early in the depth of the night to have this sleep-maker poured out. Then the fields were filled with liquid for three palms,14 through the power of the majesty of this god. Then this goddess went at dawn, and she found this (place) flooded. Then her face (looked) beautiful therein. Then she drank, and it was good in her heart She came (back) drunken, without having perceived mankind. (The remainder of this story has to do with the origin of certain names and customs, such as the use of strong drink at the Feast of Hat-Hor.)
Heroic Tales—Exploits of Gods and Human Beings
THE REPULSING OF THE DRAGON
When the boat of the sun entered the western darkness at evening, it faced the peril of a serpent or dragon, which might destroy the sun; cf. pp. 6-7 above. Then it was the function of the god Seth to repel this beast, so that the sun might cross the underworld by night and be reborn in the morning. In like manner, man should survive death and be reborn.

If the passive, "have been blindfolded," is correct, Seth has taken measures against the hypnotic stare of the serpent. But a variant text gives: "I have bound thee," suggesting that we should read: "I have blindfolded (thee)." 8 The question and answer are probably a gloss inserted for the mortuary purposes of the text. What, for the benefit of the dead man, is this magic against the destructive serpent? It is that the funerary ritual has made the dead man an a^h, an "effective being." 9 The serpent's effective power is not its own and may easily be carried off by Seth. 10 Who have the forms of serpents. 11 Re himself. 12 The serpent.

THE GOD A N D HIS UNKNOWN NAME OF POWER
To the ancient, the name was an dement of personality and of power. It might be so charged with divine potency that it could not be pronounced. Or the god might retain a name hidden for himself alone, maintaining this dement of power over all other gods and men. The following myth tells how the supreme god Re had many names, one of which was hidden and was thus a source of supremacy. The goddess Isis plotted to learn this name and thus to secure power for herself. For this purpose, she employed the venom of a snake against Re. The .text thus came to be employed as a conjuration against the bite of a scorpion, and this use probably accounts for the survival of the myth.
The two manuscripts have been dated to the Nineteenth Dynasty (1350-1200 B.C.). The Turin text is ascribed to Lower Egypt, the Beatty text to Thebes. The fuller text is on a papyrus in Turin, published by F. Rossi and W. Pleyte, Papyrus de Turin (Leyden, 1869-76), Pis. cxxxi: i2-cxxxm:i4, LXXVII plus xxxi:i-5· (Pis. LXXVII and xxxi constitute a single column.) There is also a facsimile in G. Möller, Hieratische Lesestücl(e, 11 (Leipzig, 1927), 30-32. Papyrus Chester Beatty XI (British Museum 10691), recto i-iv, is more fragmentary. It is published in Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Third Series. Chester Beatty Gift, ed. by A. H. Gardiner (London, 1935), 116-18, Pis. 64-65. Translated by A. Erman and H. Ranke, Aegypten (Tiibingen, 1923), 301-04, and by G. Roeder, Urkunden zur Religion des alten Aegypten (lena, 1923), 138-41.* The text also appears on ostraca, e.g., I. Cerny and A. H. Gardiner, Hieratic Ostraca 1 (Oxford, 1957), Pis. 11, 111.
T H E SPELL OF the divine god, who came into being by himself, who made heaven, earth, water, the breath of life, fire, gods, men, small and large cattle, creeping things, birds, and fishes, the king of men and gods at one time, (for whom) the limits (go) beyond years, abounding in names, unknown to that (god) and unknown to this (god). Now Isis was a clever woman. Her heart was craftier than (cxxxii i) a million men; she was choicer than a million gods; she was more discerning than a million of the noble dead. There was nothing which she did not know in heaven and earth, like Re, who made the content of the earth. The goddess purposed in her heart to learn the name of the august god. Now Re entered every day at the head of the crew, taking his place on the throne of the two horizons.1 A divine old age had slackened his mouth. He cast his spittle upon the ground and spat it out, fallen upon the soil. Isis kneaded it for herself with her hand, together

evening. Since Seth was, according to another myth, the enemy of Osiris and thus of the dead, most texts replace Seth by "Hat-Hor, Lady of the Evening." Since the dead entered the west, an acquaintance with the powerful forces of the west and the afterworld was of use to the dead.

with the earth on which it was. She built it up into an august snake; she made it in the form of a sharp point. It did not stir alive before her, (but) she left it at the crossroads past which the great god used to go according to the desire of his heart throughout (5) his T w o Lands. The august god appeared out of doors, with the gods from the palace accompanying him, so that he might stroll as on every day. The august snake bit him. The living fire came forth from his own self, and it vanished among the grass.2 When the divine god could gain his voice, the noise of his majesty reached the heavens. His Ennead said: "What is it? What is it?", and his gods said: "What? What?" (But) he could not find his voice to answer about it. His lips were trembling, and all his members shuddered. The poison took possession of his flesh as the Nile takes possession (of the land) after it. When the great god had composed his heart, he cried out to his retinue: "Come to me,® ye who came into being in my body, ye gods who came forth from me, that I may make known to you what has happened! Something painful has stabbed me. My heart does [not] recognize it, my eyes have not seen it, my hand did not make it, and I do not recognize it in all that I have made. I have not tasted a pain like unto it, and there is nothing more painful (10) than it. "I am a noble, the son of a noble, the fluid of a god, who came into being as a god. I am a great one, the son of a great one. My father thought out my name.4 I am abounding in names and abounding in forms. My forms exist as every god; I am called A turn and Horus-ofPraise. My father and my mother told me my name, (but) it was hidden in my body before I was born, in order that the power of a male or female magician might not be made to play against me. While I was going out of doors to see what I had made (and to) stroll in the Two Lands which I have created, something has stung me—I know not what. It is not really fire; it is not really water. My heart is on fire, my body is trembling, and all my members have a birth of chill.
"Let the children of the gods be brought to me, the beneficent of speech, who know their (magic) spells, whose wisdom reaches the heavens." (cxxxiii 1) So the children of the gods came, every one of them having his mourning, (but) Isis came with her skill, her speech having the breath of life, her utterances expelling pain, and her words reviving him whose throat was constricted.5 She said: "What is it, what is it, my divine father? What—a snake stabbed weakness into thee? One of thy children lifted up his head against thee ? Then I shall cast it down with effective magic. I shall make it retreat at the sight of thy rays." The holy god opened his mouth: "It is that I was

We should not be too much concerned with the literary formula which gives the creator-god a father and mother. They appear solely to confer his unknown name upon him. 5 One who had suffered a bite or sting could not breathe the "breath of life."
going along the way, strolling in the T w o Lands and the foreign countries, for my heart desired to see what I had created, when I was bitten by a snake, without seeing it. It is not really fire; it is not really water; (but) I am colder than water, I am hotter than fire. (5) My entire body is sweating, while I am shivering. My eye (is) not steadfast, and I cannot see. The heavens are beating upon my face as at the time of summer." Then Isis said: "Tell me thy name, my divine father, for a person lives with whose name one recites (magic)." "I am he who made heaven and earth, who knotted together the mountains, and created what is thereon. I am he who made the waters, so that the Heavenly Cow might come into being.6 I am he who made the bull for the cow, so that sexual pleasures might come into being. I am he who made the heaven and the mysteries of the two horizons, so that the soul of the gods might be placed therein. I am he who opened his eyes, so that light might come into being, who closed his eyes, so that darkness might come into being, in conformance with whose command the Nile flows, (but) whose name the gods have not learned. I am he who made the hours, so that days might come into being. I am he who opened the year and created the river.71 am he who made the living fire, in order to bring into being (10) the work of the palace.81 am Khepri in the morning, Re at noon, and A turn who is in the evening."*
(But) the poison was not checked in its course, and the great god did not recover. T H E N Isis SAID to Re: ' T h y name is not really among these which thou hast told me. If thou tellest it to me, the poison will come forth, for a person whose name is pronounced lives." The poison burned with a burning. It was more powerful than flame or fire. Then the majesty of Re said: "Let thy ears be given to me, my daughter Isis, that my name may come forth from my body into thy body. The (most) divine among the gods concealed it, so that my place might be wide in the Barque of Millions (of Years).10 If there should take place a first time of (its) issuing [from] my heart, tell it to (thy) son Horus, after thou hast threatened him with an oath of the god and hast placed the god in his eyes."11 The great god divulged his name to Isis, the Great of Magic. "Flow forth, scorpion poison! Come forth from Re, O Eye of Horus! Come forth from the burning god (lxxvii 1) at my spell! It is I who acts; it is I who sends (the message). Come upon the ground, O mighty poison! Behold, the great god has divulged his name, and
6 Mehet Wcrct "the Great Flood" carries the concept of the heavens as an ocean in the form of a cow, upon which the barque of the sun sailed. 7 The creator-god made time and the marking of time, including the annual inundation. 8 If the word be really "palace," the claim may be that Re established the kingship. 9 Three forms of deity in which the sun crossed the sky. 10 The sun barque was Re's place of command. It had greater scope if he possessed a secret name of power. 11 If Re had to divulge his name, he was willing that Isis communicate it to Horus, but only on condition that Horus be laid under an oath to keep it secret.

THE CONTEST OF HORUS AND SETH FOR THE RULE
Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt are two distinct lands, but are united by contiguity, common dependence upon the Nile, and isolation from other lands. Egyptians have always been conscious of the difference between the " T w o Lands," and the reconciliation of two competing areas is a recurrent theme in mythology and the dogma of rule. The commonest expression of this theme is a contest between the gods Horus and Seth to inherit the rule of Osiris, father of Horus and brother of Seth, with a final reconciliation of the two feuding gods to become a united pair.
The following tale draws from this myth for a lusty folkstory, told for entertainment rather than didactic purpose. The language, style, and treatment of the tale are colloquial—and will be so translated1—and the gods are depicted as petty and childish. The setting of the story is juridical, with the supreme tribunal of the gods, the Ennead,2 attempting to setde the contest. The president of this tribunal is the sun-god Re. The manuscript of the story was written in Thebes in the Twentieth Dynasty (12th century B.C.). The hieratic text is on Papyrus Chester Beatty I, recto i i-xvi 8. Published with photographs, a transcription into hieroglyphic, translation and commentary by A. H. Gardiner, The Library of A. Chester Beatty. Description of a Hieratic Papyrus with a Mythological Story, Love-Songs, and Other Miscellaneous Texts (Oxford, 1931).

12 The manuscript permits at this point the insertion of the name of a suffering Egyptian—"X, the son of (his mother) Y"—so that this charm might be used to cure him. 13 The Turin papyrus (PI. LXXVII) has a vignette showing these four gods, so that they may be copied for this use.
1 For example, the pronoun, and pers. sing., will be translated "you," instead of the "thou" which would be appropriate in a more dignified text of the classical language. 2 The corporation of gods, originally nine (cf. pp. 3, 6 above), was no longer thought of in terms of a number. Presiding over this "Ennead" was Re, the "All-Lord." The reader should not be distressed if this presiding judge is called by some of his other phases of activity: the Re, the Re-Harakhti, or Atum.
up [the west with] his [appear]ance, while Thoth was presenting the Eye [to] the mighty prince who is in Heliopolis.8 T H E N Shu, the son of Re, SAID before [Atum, the] mighty [prince] who is in Heliopolis: "Just is the Lord, strong and . . . is he, in saying: Give the office to [Horus]!" (5) T H E N Thoth [SAID] to the [Ennead: "Right,] a million times!" T H E N Isis [gave] a great cry, and she rejoiced very, [very much, and she stood] before the All-[Lord,] and she said: "North wind, (go) to the west! Give the good news to King Wen-nofer—life, prosperity, health!"4 [ T H E N ] Shu, the son [of Re,] SAID: "[The] presenting of the Eye is the justice of the Ennead!"
What the All-Lord [said]: "Here—what do you mean by taking action alone!" T H E N . . . said: "He has [taken] the name-ring of Horus, and the [White] Crown has been [put] on his head!"5 T H E N the All-Lord was silent for a long [time, for] he was angry [at] the Ennead. T H E N Seth, the son of Nut, said: "Have him dismissed (10) along with me, so that I may show you how my hand prevails over his hand [in the] presence of the Ennead, for nobody knows [any (other)] way [to] strip him!" T H E N Thoth said to him: "Shouldn't we know the guilty one? Now, should the office of Osiris be given to Seth, when [his] son Horus is standing (here in court) ?"6 T H E N the Re-Har-akhti was very, very angry, for it was the wish of the Re (ii 1) to give the office to Seth, the great of strength, the son of Nut.7 And Onuris'gave a great cry before the Ennead, saying: "What are we going to do!" II (ii 2-7)
(In their confusion, the gods appeal to a god of generation, who might—as a sort of obstetrician—advise them on the legitimacy of the two contestants. This god evades the responsibility of a decision and suggests that they might ask the ancient goddess Neith, an old crone whose lore might be decisive.)
Ill (ii 7-iii 7)
T H E N the Ennead said to Thoth in the presence of the All-Lord: "Please write a letter to Neith, the Great, the God's Mother, in the name of the All-Lord, the Bull Residing in Heliopolis." T H E N Thoth said: "I will do (it), yes, I will, I will!" T H E N HE sat down to write a letter, and he said:
8 At a time when the moon-god Thoth was offering to the sun-god Re the sacred eye, which was both an eye of heaven and a symbol of justice, the youthful Horus put in his claim to his father's rule. * The north wind was the propitious wind. Osiris Wen-nofer was ruler in the west, the realm of the dead. B This member of the Ennead, whose name is lost in a lacuna, regards the election of Horus to the rule as an accomplished fact: Horus' name written in the royal cartouche and the crown of Upper Egypt—Seth's provinceupon his head. Re disagrees, as he favors Seth (cf. n.7 below). 6 The advocate Thoth takes the legal position that a court of justice has a responsibility to establish the rights and wrongs of a case when a client has made a formal appeal. 7 Re's partiality to Seth may be a result of Seth's activity in repelling the monster which nightly threatened to destroy the barque of Re (cf. pp. 1112 above).

"The King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Re-(ii 10) Atum, the beloved of Thoth, the Lord of the T w o Lands, the Heliopolitan,... ,8 to this effect: This your servant spends the night in concern over Osiris and consulting the T w o Lands every day, while Sobek endures forever.9 What are we going to do for the two men who have been in the court for eighty years up to now, but (iii 1) no one is able to pass judgment on the two? Please write us what we should do!" T H E N Neith, the Great, the God's Mother, sent a letter to the Ennead, saying: "Give the office of Osiris to his son Horus! Don't do these great acts of wickedness, which are not in their place, or I shall be angry, and the sky will crash to the ground! And have the All-Lord, the Bull Residing in Heliopolis, told: Double Seth in his property; give him Anath and Astarte, your two daughters; and (5) put Horus in the place of his father Osiris."10 THEN the letter of Neith, the Great, the God's Mother, reached the Ennead, while they were sitting in the broad hall (named) "Horus-Foremost-of-Horns," and the letter was put in Thoth's hand. T H E N Thoth read it out in the presence of the All-Lord and the entire Ennead. And they said with one voice: "This goddess is right!"
IV (iii 7-iv 3)
THEN the All-Lord was angry at Horus, and he said to him: "You are weak in your body, so this office is too much for you, you boy, with the taste of his mouth (still) bad!"11 T H E N Onuris was angry a million times, and likewise the entire Ennead, that is, the Thirtylife, prosperity, health!12 And the god Baba drew himself up, and he (iii 10) said to the Re-Har-akhti: "Your shrine is empty!"18 T H E N the Re-Har-akhti was hurt at the retort which had been made to him, and he lay down on his back, and his heart was very wretched. THEN the Ennead went out, and they gave a great cry in the face of the god Baba, and they said to him: "Get out! This crime which you have committed is very great!" And they went to their tents. T H E N the great god spent a day (iv 1) lying on his back in his arbor, and his heart was very wretched, and he was alone.
Now AFTER A LONG TIME, THEN Hat-Hor, the Lady of the Southern Sycamore, came, and she stood before her father, the All-Lord, and she uncovered her private parts
8 Re here borrows the formal series of titles used by an Egyptian pharaoh. This translation omits the rest of these titles. 9 Re suggests that he has to worry about Osiris, whereas Neith need not worry about her son Sobek, who does not die. 10 In contrast to RE, the peppery old goddess begins her letter without any formal address. She has no doubt that Horus should receive his father's rule, but she recognizes that Seth merits some compensation, so that she recommends enriching him and giving him Re's two daughters. Anath and Astarte were Semitic goddesses; Seth served as an Egyptian god for foreign countries; thus the proposal had its point; cf. p. 249. 11 N. Shiah, in JEA, xxiv (1938), 127 f., quotes Chinese taunts directed at youths, to the effect that their mouths still have the bad smell of undried mother's milk. 12 The "Thirty" were the magisterial councils of Egypt. The word no longer necessitates an exact number, any more than the "Ennead" does. 18 Sarcastic for: You arc not functioning as a god any more. The name Baba is here determined with an animal sign. In K. Sethe, Die altagyptischen Pyramidentexte, 11, §13498, a Babui is described as "red of ear, colored of buttocks." Babui-Baba may be be a baboon, here in a monkeyish role.
before his face.14 T H E N the great god laughed at her. T H E N HE got up, and he sat down with the Great Ennead, and he said to Horus and Seth: "Say your say!"
V (iv 3-v 6)
(The discussion immediately breaks down into wrangling. When Isis, the mother of Horus, intervenes on her son's behalf, Seth is furious and threatens to kill one of the gods every day. He refuses to take part in the trial while Isis is present. The gods therefore isolate themselves on "Central Island" and charge the ferryman not to transport any woman resembling Isis.)
VI (v 6-vi 2)
(Isis disguises herself and bribes the ferryman to take her over to "Central Island.")
VII (vi 2-viii i)
(In the guise of a maiden, Isis lures Seth away from the Ennead and, by a play on words, tricks him into validating the claim of Horus.)
VIII (viii 1-6)
(Over the protest of Seth, the Ennead awards the office to Horus.) IX (viii 6-ix 7)
(Seth succeeds in staying the award by challenging Horus to an ordeal. They become two hippopotamuses and try to stay under water for three full months, with the office to be given to the one who lasts longest under water. However, Isis complicates the contest by trying to harpoon Seth. He appeals to her sisterly feeling, and she withdraws the harpoon from his hide.)
X (ix 7-xi 1)
(Horus is angry at his mother's change of heart and cuts off her head. The Ennead permits Seth to punish Horus by removing his eyes and burying them "to illuminate the earth." Hat-Hor restores Horus's sight with drops of gazelle milk. Re appeals to the two contestants to stop quarreling. This episode must have some relation to the sun and the moon as the two eyes of Horus in his function as sky-god.)
XI (xi i-xiii 2)
(A bawdy episode, in which Seth attempts to impugn the virility of Horus but is outwitted by Isis.)
XII (xiii 2-xiv 4)
T H E N Seth made a great oath to god, saying: "The office shouldn't be given to him until he has been dismissed (from court) with me and we have built ourselves some stone ships and we have a race, the two (of us)! Then the one who beats his opponent, (xiii 5) the office of Ruler—life, prosperity, health!—shall be given to him!"
14 Hat-Hor was the goddess of love. Her role here was to cajole the supreme god out of his sulkiness and bring him back to the tribunal.

T H E N Horns built himself a ship of cedar, and he plastered it with gypsum, and he launched it on the water in the evening time, without any man who was in the entire land having seen it. T H E N Seth saw the ship of Horus, and he thought it was stone, and he went to the mountain, and he cut off a mountain peak, and he built himself a stone ship of 138 cubits.15 T H E N THEY embarked in their ships in the presence of the Ennead. Then the ship of Seth sank in the water. T H E N Seth changed himself into a hippopotamus, (10) so that he might cause the wreck of Horus' ship. T H E N Horus took his harpoon, and he threw it at the majesty of Seth.16 T H E N the Ennead said to him: "Don't throw it at him!" T H E N HE took the water weapons, and he laid them in his ship, and he sailed downstream to Sais to speak (to) Neith, the Great, the God's Mother:17 "Let me be judged with Seth, since we have been in the court for EIGHTY years up to now, (xiv 1) but no one is able to pass judgment on us! He has not been declared right over me, but a thousand times up to now I have been right over him every day! But he pays no attention to anything that the Ennead says. I contested with him in the broad hall (named) 'Way-of-Truths,' and I was declared right over him. I contested with him in the broad hall (named) 'Horus-Foremost-of-Horns,' and was declared right over him. I contested with him in the broad hall (named) 'Field-of-Reeds,' and I was declared right over him. I contested with him in the broad hall (named) 'the-Field-Pool,' and I was declared right over him."
And the Ennead said to Shu, the son of Re: "Horus, the son of Isis, is right in all that he has said!"18
XIII (xiv 5-xv 10)
So Thoth said to the All-Lord: "Have a letter sent to Osiris, so that he may pass judgment on the two boys." T H E N Shu, the son of Re, SAID: "What Thoth has said to the Ennead is right a million times!" T H E N the AllLord said to Thoth: "Sit down and write a letter to Osiris, so that we may hear what he has to say." T H E N Thoth sat down to complete a letter to Osiris, saying: "The Bull: the Lion that Hunts for Himself; the Two Goddesses: Protecting the Gods and Curbing the T w o Lands; the Horus of Gold: Discoverer of Mankind in the Primeval Time; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Bull Residing in Heliopolis—life, prosperity, health!—the Son of Ptah: Beneficial One of the Two Banks, Who Appears as Father of His Ennead, while he eats of gold and every (kind of) precious fayencelife, prosperity, health!1" Please write us what we are
15 Over 230 feet, a length suitable for a seagoing vessel or a ceremonial barge. 16 In other accounts of the rivalry between Horus and Seth, Horus hunted the hippopotamus as an animal of Seth. 17 As in episode III above, the elder goddess Neith seems to have served as an experienced advisor. 18 It is not clear why Neith's response is unstated. Possibly Horus only threatened to appeal to her. At any rate, a response is given to Shu, as the spokesman for the Ennead. 19 As in the letter to Neith in episode III above, this letter carries only the
to do for Horus and Seth, so that we may not do something in our ignorance." Now after (many days) after this, THEN the (10) letter reached the king, the Son of Re: Great of Overflow, Lord of Provisions.20 Then he gave a great cry when the letter was read out before him. T H E N he answered it very, very quickly to the place where the All-Lord was with the Ennead, saying: "Why should my son Horus be cheated, since I am the one who made you strong? Now I am the one who made barley and emmer to keep the gods alive, as well as the cattle after the gods! And no (other) god or goddess at all found himself (able) to do it!" Then the (xv 1) letter of Osiris reached the place where the Re-Har-akhti was, sitting with the Ennead in Xois at the bright(est) time.21 Then it was read out before him and the Ennead. And the Re-Har-akhti said: "Please answer for me the letter very quickly to Osiris, and say to him about the letter: 'Suppose that you had never come into being, or suppose that you had never been born—barley and emmer would still exist!' "22 Then the letter of the All-Lord reached Osiris, and it was read out before him. T H E N HE sent to the Re-Harakhti again, saying: "Very, very fine is everything that you have done, you discoverer of the Ennead as a deed (accomplished) while justice was permitted to sink down into the Underworld!23 Now look at the case again, yourself! As to (5) the land in which I am, it is filled with savage-faced messengers, and they are not afraid of any god or goddess! I can send them out, and they will bring back the heart of anyone who does wrong, and (then) they will be here with me!24 Why, what does it mean, my being here resting in the West, while every single one of you is outside ? Who among them25 is stronger than I ? But see, they25 discovered falsehood as an accomplishment. Now when Ptah, the Great, South-of-His-Wall, Lord of the Life of the Two Lands, made the sky, didn't he say to the stars which are in it: 'You shall go to rest (in) the West every night, in the place where King Osiris is' ? 'And, after the gods, the people and the folk shall also go to rest in the place where you are'—so he said to me."26
Now after (many days) after this, the letter of Osiris reached the place where the All-Lord was with the Ennead. T H E N Thoth took the letter, and he read it out
titles of the addresser, given in imitation of the fivefold titulary of a pharaoh. Attention might be directed to the interesting epithet of Re: "Discoverer of Mankind in the Primeval Time." Osiris (see the next note) it treated as the ruler of another realm, that of the dead. 20 A royal name for Osiris as the god of grain. 21 Xois in the Delta was a cult-seat of Re. "The bright time" may be high noon. 22 Re abandons the real issue and argues Osiris's claim to have made the grain which keeps the gods alive. 23 In the sarcastic view of Osiris, Re's preoccupation with building up his circle of gods has led him to neglect justice. 24 Here, perhaps for the first time, the Egyptian underworld is regarded as a Hades for evildoers, from which Osiris may send out angels ("messengers") to claim evildoers. 25 Sic. but read "you." 20 Osiris's argument of superior authority is that he is the god of the dead and that stars, gods, and humans ultimately come to be under his rule.

before the Re-Har-akhti ( 1 0 ) and the Ennead. T H E N THEY said: "Right, right in all that he has said is the (King): Great of Overflow, Lord of Provisions—life, prosperity, health!"
XIV (xv io-xvi 8)
T H E N Seth said: "Let us be taken to the Central Island, so that I may contend with him." T H E N HE went to the Central Island, and Horus was conceded the right over him. T H E N A turn, Lord of the T w o Lands, the Heliopolitan, sent to Isis, saying: "Fetch Seth, fastened in handcuffs!" T H E N Isis fetched Seth, fastened in handcuffs, he being a prisoner. T H E N Atum said to him: "Why didn't you allow judgment to be passed on (the two of) you, instead of taking the office of Horus for yourself?" T H E N Seth said to him: "No, my good lord! Let Horus the son of Isis, be called and given the office of (xvi i) his father Osiris!"
T H E N Horus, the son of Isis, was brought, and the White Crown was set upon his head, and he was put in the place of his father Osiris. And it was said to him: "You are the good king of Egypt; you are the good Lord—life, prosperity, health!—of Every Land up to eternity and forever!" T H E N Isis gave a great cry to her son Horus, saying: "You are the good king! My heart rejoices that you light up the earth with your color!" T H E N Ptah, the Great, South-of-His-Wall, Lord of the Life of the Two Lands, said: "What is to be done for Seth? For, see, Horus has been put in the place of his father Osiris!" T H E N the Re-Har-akhti said: "Let Seth, the son of Nut, be given to me, so that he may live with me and be a son to me. And he shall speak out in the sky, and men shall be afraid of him."27 T H E N THEY ( 5 ) went to say to the Re-Har-akhti: "Horus, the son of Isis, has arisen as the Ruler—life, prosperity, health!" T H E N the Re rejoiced very much, and he said to the Ennead: "You should be glad! To the ground, to the ground, for Horus, the son of Isis!" Then Isis said: "Horus has arisen as the Ruler—life, prosperity, health! The Ennead is in jubilee, and heaven is in joy!" They took wreaths when they saw Horus, the son of Isis, arisen as the great Ruler—life, prosperity, health!—of Egypt. The hearts of the Ennead were content, and the entire earth was in jubilation, when they saw Horus, the son of Isis, assigned the office of his father Osiris, Lord of Busiris. It has come to a happy ending in Thebes, the Place of Truth.
ASTARTE A N D THE TRIBUTE OF THE SEA
The excuse for introducing so damaged a document is that we may have here the Egyptian version of a tale current in Asia. The badly damaged papyrus gives us little certainty about the purport of the story, but it may be guessed that it told how the gods—in this case, the Egyptian gods—were freed of the obligation to pay tribute to the sea. The Phoenician goddess
27 The special attachment of Re and Seth is again indicated; cf. n.7 above. Seth was to be located, as the thunder-god, in the heavens with the sun-god; cf. pp. 27, n.23; 249.
, AND M O R T U A R Y TEXTS 17
Astarte, whom the Egyptians of the Empire had introduced into Egypt and who here appears as the "daughter of Ptah," was instrumental in this deliverance from tribute. Any reconstruction must be treated with great reserve. The Astarte Papyrus, formerly in the Amherst collection and now in the Morgan collection in New York, dates from the Eighteenth or Nineteenth Dynasty (1550-1200 B.C.). Photographs of the papyrus were given by P. E. Newberry, The Amherst Papyri (London, 1899), Pis. XIX-XXI. Photographs, a translation, and commentary were given by A. H. Gardiner in Studies Presented to F. LI. Griffith (London, 1932), 74 ff. Gardiner points out a general similarity between the Astarte tale and Enuma elish, the Babylonian account of the creation, in which the enemy of the gods is Ti'amat, the sea (cf. pp. 60-72). A. H. Sayce called attention to possible Hittite parallels in JEA, xix (1933), 56 ff. A transcription into hieroglyphic was given by Gardiner in Late-Egyptian Stories (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, 1, Brussels, 1932), 76-81.
(At the visible beginning of the text all seems to be well with the gods, of whom Ptah, the Sky, and the Earth are mentioned. In what follows, it seems that the Sea claims tribute from the gods as their ruler and that the harvest-goddess Renenut delivered this.) (i x + 8 ) .. . [hi]s throne of Ruler—life, prosperity, health! And he carried to him tribute . . . from the tribunal. Then Renenut carried [this tribute to the Sea, as it was due to him] as Ruler— life, prosperity, health! [One of the gods said]: " . . . sky. Now, behold, tribute must be brought to him, .. . ( x + n ) . . . his . . . , or he will carry us off as booty. . . . our own for . . ." [Then] Renenut [carried] his tribute of silver and gold, lapis l a z u l i , . . . the boxes. (At this point the Ennead of gods seems to express apprehension and ask questions. Perhaps their relations with the Sea have worsened through his added demands. Apparently they need an intermediary and pick Astarte as suitable for that purpose. It seems that Renenut sent a bird to appeal to Astarte to undertake this mission on behalf of the gods.) (ii x + 3 ) . . . And Renenut took a Astarte. Then said [Renenut to one of certain] birds: "Hear what I shall say; thou shouldst not go away . . . another. Come, that thou mayest go to Astarte... [and fly to] her house and speak under [the window of the room where] she is sleeping and say to her: 'If [thou art awake, hear my voice.] If thou art asleep, I shall waken [thee.

THE STORY OF SI-NUHE
A strong love of country was a dominant characteristic of the ancient Egyptian. Though he might feel the responsibilities of empire-building, he wished the assurance that he would close his days on the banks of the Nile. That sentiment made the following story one of the most popular classics of Egyptian literature. An Egyptian official of the Middle Kingdom went into voluntary exile in Asia. He was prosperous and well established there, but he continued to long for the land of his birth. Finally he received a royal invitation to return and join the court. This was his real success in life, and this was the popular point of the story. Much of the tale is pompous and over-styled in wording and phrasing, but the central narrative is a credible account, which fits the period as we know it. If this was fiction, it was based on realities and deserves a respected place in Egyptian literature.
The story opens with the death of Amen-em-het I (about i960 B c.) and continues in the reign of his successor, Sen-Usert
I (about 1971-1928 B.C.). Manuscripts are plentiful and run from the late Twelfth Dynasty (about 1800 B.C.) to the TwentyFirst Dynasty (about 1000 B.C.). There are five papyri and at least seventeen ostraca. The most important papyri are in Berlin (3022 [the B manuscript] and 10499 [the R manuscript]), and were published by A. H. Gardiner, in Berlin.

The definitive study of the texts was made by A. H. Gardiner, Notes on the Story of Sinuhe (reprinted from Recueil de travaux . . . , Vols, xxxn-xxxvi, Paris, 1916), in which reference is given to the antecedent literature. A. M.

District Overseer of the domains of the Sovereign in the lands of the Asiatics, real acquaintance of the king, his beloved, the Attendant Si-nuhe. He says: I was an attendant who followed his lord, a servant of the royal harem (and of) the Hereditary Princess, the great of favor, the wife of King Sen-Usert in (the pyramid town) Khenem-sut, the daughter of King Amenem-het (R5) in (the pyramid town) Qa-nefru, Nefru, the lady of reverence.1

The god ascended to his horizon; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Sehetep-ib-Re was taken up to heaven and united with the sun disc. The body of the god merged with him who made him.8 The Residence City was in silence, hearts were in mourning, the Great Double Doors were sealed shut. (Rio) The courtiers (sat) head on lap, and the people were in grief. Now his majesty had sent an army to the land of the Temeh-Libyans, with his eldest son as the commander thereof, the good god Sen-Usert, (R15) and even now he was returning and had carried off living captives of the Tehenu-Libyans and all (kinds of) cattle without number. The courtiers of the palace sent to the western border to let the King's Son know the events which had taken place at the court. The messengers met him on the road, (R20) and they reached him in the evening time. He did not delay a moment; the falcon4 flew away with his attendants, without letting his army know it Now the royal children who had been following him in this

army had been sent for, ( B i ) and one of them was summoned. While I was standing (near by) I heard his voice as he was speaking and I was a little way off. My heart was distraught, my arms spread out (in dismay), trembling fell upon all my limbs.5 I removed myself by leaps and bounds to seek a hiding place for myself. I placed (5) myself between two bushes, in order to cut (myself) off from the road and its travel.
*I set out southward, (but) I did not plan to reach this Residence City, (for) I thought that there would be civil disorder, and I did not expect to live after him. I crossed Lake Ma'aty near Sycamore, and I came to Snefru Island. I spent the day there on the edge of (10) the fields. I came into the open light, while it was (still) day, and I met a man standing near by. He stood in awe of me, for he was afraid. When the time of the evening meal came, I drew near to Ox-town. I crossed over in a barge without a rudder, by aid of the west wind.6 I passed by the east of the quarry (15) above Mistress-of-the-Red-Mountain.71 gave (free) road to my feet going northward, and I came, up to the Wall-of-theRuler,8 made to oppose the Asiatics and to crush the Sand-Crossers. I took a crouching position in a bush, for fear lest the watchmen upon the wall where their day's (duty) was might see me.
I set out (20) at evening time, and when day broke I reached Peten. I halted at the Island of Kem-wer." An attack of thirst overtook me. I was parched, and my throat was dusty. I said: "This is the taste of death!" (But then) I lifted up my heart and collected myself, for I had heard the sound of the lowing of cattle, (25) and I spied Asiatics. The sheikh among them, who had been in Egypt, recognized me. Then he gave me water while he boiled milk for me. I went with him to his tribe. What they did (for me) was good..
One foreign country gave me to another. I set off for Byblos and approached Qedem,10 and spent (30) a year and a half there. Ammi-enshi11—he was a ruler of Upper Retenu12—took me and said to me: "Thou wilt do well
5 We are never directly told the reason for Si-nuhe's sudden fright and voluntary exile. Later both he and the king protest his innocence. He may have been legally guildess, but the transition between kings was a dangerous time for one who was not fully identified with the new king. Si-nuhe's official loyalty was to the princess. The Instruction of King Amen-em-het (pp. 418-419 below) acquaints us with a palace conspiracy, perhaps a harem conspiracy, at or near the end of that king's reign. We must assume that Si-nuhe had adequate reason for his sudden and furtive departure and his long stay in Asia. 6 Apparendy Si-nuhe went southeast along the edge of the cultivated land, to avoid the peopled stretches of the Delta, and crossed the Nile where it is a single stream, somewhere near modern Cairo. 7 Gebel el-Ahmar, east of Cairo. 8 The fortresses at the eastern frontier, along the general line of the present Suez CanaL See also p. 446 below. • The area of the Bitter Lakes. 10 Semitic for "the East" generally. A vague term, either in the writer's ignorance of Asiatic geography or intentionally vague for a wide nomadic area. II An Amorite name. It was unfamiliar to one Egyptian scribe, who tried to egyptianize it to "Amu's son Enshi." 12 Highland country, probably including northern Palestine, southern and central Syria. See A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica (London, 1947), 1, 142* if. Si-nuhe's Asiatic home of Yaa cannot be located any more definitely than this. It may be noted that it is agricultural, with herds, but within reasonable distance of desert hunting, and that it is close enough to some main road that Si-nuhe may entertain Egyptian couriers. Since he
with me, and thou wilt hear the speech of Egypt" He said this, for he knew my character, he had heard of my wisdom, and the people of Egypt who were there with him18 had borne witness for me. Then he said to me: (35) "Why hast thou come hither? Has something happened in the Residence City?" Then I said to him: "The King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Sehetep-ib-Re is departed to the horizon, and no one knows what might happen because of it." But I said equivocally: "I had come from an expedition to the land of Temeh, when report was made to me. My heart quailed; it carried (40) me off on the way of flight. (Yet) no one had gossiped about me; no one had spat in my face; not a belittling word had been heard, nor had my name been heard in the mouth of the herald. I do not know what brought me to this country. It was as though it might be a god." Then he said to me: "Well, what will that land be like without him, that beneficent god, the fear of whom pervaded (45) foreign countries like (the fear of) Sekhmet in a year of pestilence?"14 I spoke to him that I might answer him: "Well, of course, his son has entered into the palace and has taken the inheritance of his father. Moreover, he is a god without his peer. There is no other who surpasses him. He is a master of understanding, effective in plans and beneficent of decrees. Going forth and coming back are in conformance with (50) his command. He it was who subdued the foreign countries while his father was in his palace, and he reported to him that what had been charged to him had been carried out 15 How joyful is this land which he has ruled! (71) He is one who extends its frontiers. He will carry off the lands of the south, and he will not consider the northern countries (seriously), (for) he was made to smite the Asiatics and to crush the Sand-Crossers. Send to him! Let him know thy name! Do not utter a curse against his majesty. He will not fail to do (75) good to the country which shall be loyal to him!" Then he said to me: "Well, really, Egypt is happy that it knows that he is flourishing. Now thou art here. Thou shalt stay with me. What I shall do for thee is good." He set me at the head of his children. He married me to his eldest daughter. He let me choose for myself of his country, (80) of the choicest of that which was with him on his frontier with another country. It was a good land, named Yaa. Figs were in it, and grapes. It had more wine than water. Plentiful was its honey, abundant its olives. Every (kind of) fruit was on its trees. Barley was there, and emmer. There was no limit to any (kind of) cattle.

As it stands, the story gives a picture of Syria-Palestine in the patriarchal period. 18 Other exiles like Si-nuhe? He is in a land of refuge from Egypt From the nature of this land it seems unlikely that there would have been many Egyptian merchants. 14 The goddess Sekhmet had to do with disease. 15 This translation omits some of the fulsome praise.

to me as a result of the love of me. He made me ruler of a tribe of the choicest of his country. Bread was made for me as daily fare, wine as daily provision, cooked meat and roast fowl, beside the wild beasts of the desert, for they hunted (90) for me and laid before me, beside the catch of my (own) hounds. M a n y . . . were made for me, and milk in every (kind of) cooking. I spent many years, and my children grew up to be strong men, each man as the restrainer of his (own) tribe. The messenger who went north or who went south to the Residence City (95) stopped over with me, (for) I used to make everybody stop over. I gave water to the thirsty. I put him who had strayed (back) on the road. I rescued him who had been robbed. When the Asiatics became so bold as to oppose the rulers of foreign countries,18 I counseled their movements. This ruler of (100) (Re)tenu had me spend many years as commander of his army. Every foreign country against which I went forth, when I had made my attack on it, was driven away from its pasturage and its wells. I plundered its cattle, carried off its inhabitants, took away their food, and slew people in it (105) by my strong arm, by my bow, by my movements, and by my successful plans. I found favor in his heart, he loved me, he recognized my valor, and he placed me at the head of his children, when he saw how my arms flourished. A mighty man of Retenu came, that he might challenge me ( n o ) in my (own) camp. He was a hero without his peer, and he had repelled all of it.17 He said that he would fight me, he intended to despoil me, and he planned to plunder my cattle, on the advice of his tribe. That prince discussed (it) with me, and I said: "I do not know him. Certainly I am no confederate of his, (115) so that I might move freely in his encampment. Is it the case that I have (ever) opened his door or overthrown his fences? (Rather), it is hostility because he sees me carrying out thy commissions. I am really like a stray bull in the midst of another herd, and a bull of (these) cattle attacks him "18
During the night I strung my bow and shot my arrows,1" I gave free play to my dagger, and polished my weapons. When day broke, (Re)tenu was come. (130) It had whipped up its tribes and collected the countries of a (good) half of it. It had thought (only) of this fight Then he came to me as I was waiting, (for) I had placed myself near him. Every heart burned for me; women and men groaned. Every heart was sick for me. They said: "Is there another strong man who could fight against him?" Then {he took) his shield, his battle-axe, (135) and his armful of javelins. Now after I had let his weapons issue forth, I made his arrows

We may have here an early reference to resdess peoples who were later to participate in the invasion of Egypt, cf. pp. 229, n.9; 247, n.56. 17 He had beaten every one of the land of Retenu. 18 Si-nuhe goes on to state that he accepts the challenge, which has come to him because he is an outsider in the Asiatic scene. 19 In practice.
pass by me uselessly, one close to another. He charged me, and I shot him, my arrow sticking in his neck. He cried out and fell on his nose. (140) I felled him with his (own) battle-axe and raised my cry of victory over his back, while every Asiatic roared. I gave praise to Montu,20 while his adherents were mourning for him. This ruler Ammi-enshi took me into his embrace. Then I carried off his goods and plundered his cattle. What he had planned to do (145) to me I did to him. I took what was in his tent and stripped his encampment. I became great thereby, I became extensive in my wealth, I became abundant in my cattle. Thus did god to show mercy to him upon whom he had laid blame, whom he had led astray to another country. (But) today his heart is assuaged.21... Now when the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Kheper-ka-Re, the justified,22 was told about this situation in which I was, then his majesty kept sending (175) to me with presentations from the royal presence, that he might gladden the heart of this servant28 like the ruler of any foreign country. The royal children in his palace let me hear their commissions.24

SERVANT ABOUT BRINGING H I M ( B A C K ) TO EGYPT.

Royal decree to the Attendant Si-nuhe. Behold, this decree of the king is brought to thee to let thee know that: "Thou hast traversed the foreign countries, starting from Qedem to (Re)tenu. One country gave thee to another, under the advice of thy (own) heart to thee. What hast thou done that anything should be done to thee? Thou hast not cursed, that thy word should be punished. Thou hast not spoken against the counsel of the nobles, that thy speeches should be opposed. (185) This plan (simply) carried away thy heart. It was in no heart against thee. This thy heaven which is in the palace26 is firm and steadfast today. Her head is covered with the kingship of the land.27 Her children are in the court.

It should ndt be that thou shouldst die in a foreign country. Asiatics should not escort thee. Thou shouldst not be placed in a sheepskin when thy wall is made. This is (too) long to be roaming the earth. Give heed to sickness, that thou mayest return."31
T H I S DECREE REACHED ME AS I WAS STANDING ( 2 0 0 ) IN
THE MIDST OF M Y TRIBE. It was read to me. I put myself upon my belly; I touched the ground; I scattered it upon my hair. I went about my encampment rejoicing and saying: "How can this be done for a servant whom his heart led astray to barbarous countries ? But the indulgence which saved me from death is really good! Thy J{a will let me effect the end of my body at home!"
* C O P Y OF THE ANSWER TO THIS DECREE. T H E SERVANT OF
THE PALACE SI-NUHE (205) says:
"In very good peace! This flight which this servant made in his ignorance is known by thy O good god, Lord of the Two Lands, whom Re loves and whom Montu, Lord of Thebes, favors! . . ,82 "This is the prayer of this servant to his Lord, the
saviour in the West: THE LORD OF PERCEPTION, W H O PER
CEIVES PEOPLE, M A Y HE PERCEIVE (215) in the majesty of

"Now this flight which the servant made, it was not planned, it was not in my heart, I had not worried about it. I do not know what severed me from (my) place. It was after (225) the manner of a dream, as if

And yet—my body shuddered, my feet were trembling, my heart led me on, and the god who ordained this flight (230) drew me away. I was not at all stiff-backed formerly. A man who knows his land should be afraid, (for) Re has set the fear of thee throughout the earth, and the dread of

Then they came for this servant. — I was permitted to spend a day in Yaa handing over my property to my children, my eldest son being responsible for my tribe. (240) My tribe and all my property were in his charge: my serfs, all my cattle, my fruit, and every pleasant tree of mine. Then this servant came southward. I halted at the "Ways of Horus."36 The commander there who was responsible for the patrol sent a message to the Residence to make (it) known. Then his majesty sent a capable overseer of peasants of the palace, with loaded ships in his train, (245) carrying presentations from the royal

them by his name.37 Every butler was (busy) at his duties. When I started and set sail, the kneading and straining (of beer) was carried on beside me, until I had reached the town of Lisht.38 When day had broken, very early, they came and summoned me, ten men coming and ten men going to usher me to the palace.3" I put my brow to the ground between the sphinxes, (250) while the royai children were waiting in a recess to meet me. The courtiers who usher into the audience hall set me on the way to the private chambers. I found his majesty upon the Great Throne in a recess of fine gold. When I was stretched out upon my belly; I knew not myself in his presence, (although) this god greeted me pleasantly. I was like a man caught in the dark: (255) my soul departed, my body was powerless, my heart was not in my body, that I might know life from death.
T H E N HIS MAJESTY SAID TO ONE OF THESE COURTIERS:
"Lift him up. Let him speak to me." Then his majesty said: "Behold, thou art come. Thou hast trodden the foreign countries and made a flight. (But now) elderliness has attacked thee; thou hast reached old age. It is no small matter that thy corpse be (properly) buried; thou shouldst not be interred by bowmen.40 Do not, do not act thus any longer: (for) thou dost not speak (260) when thy name is pronounced!" Yet (I) was afraid to respond, and I answered it with the answer of one afraid: "What is it that my lord says to me? I should answer it, (but) there is nothing that I can do: it is really the hand of a god. It is a terror that is in my belly like that which produced the fated flight. BEHOLD,

I AM BEFORE THEE. T H I N E IS LIFE. M A Y THY MAJESTY DO AS HE PLEASES."
THEREUPON the royal children WERE ushered in. Then his majesty said to the Queen: "Here is Si-nuhe, (265) come as a Bedu, (in) the guise of the Asiatics." She gave a very great cry, and the royal children clamored all together. Then they said to his majesty: "It is not really he, O Sovereign, my lord!" Then his majesty said: "It is really he!" Now when they had brought with them their bead-necklaces, their rattles, and their sistra, then they presented them to his majesty. " . . . Loose the horn of thy bow and relax thy arrow ! (275) Give breath to him that was stifled! Give us our goodly gift in this sheikh Si-Mehit,41 a bowman born in Egypt. He made a flight through fear of thee; he left the land through terror of thee. (But) the face of him who beholds thy face shall not blench; the eye which looks at thee shall not be afraid!" Then his majesty said: "He shall not fear. (280) He has no title to be in dread. He shall be a courtier among the nobles. He shall be put in the ranks of the courtiers. Proceed ye to the inner chambers of the morning (toilet), in order to make his position."42 So I went forth from the midst of the inner chambers, with the royal children giving me their hands. (285) Thereafter we went to the Great Double Door. I was put into the house of a royal son, in which were splendid things. A cool room was in it, and images of the horizon.43 Costly things of the Treasury were in it. Clothing of royal linen, myrrh, and prime oil of the king and of the nobles whom he loves were in every room. (290) Every butler was (busy) at his duties. Years were made to pass away from my body. I was pluc\ed, and my hair was combed. A load (of dirt) was given to the desert, and my clothes (to) the Sand-Crossers. I was clad in fine linen and anointed with prime oil. I slept on a bed. I gave up the sand to them who are in it, (295) and wood oil to him who is anointed with it. I was given a house which had a garden, which had been in the possession of a courtier. Many craftsmen built it, and all its wood (work) was newly restored. Meals were brought to me from the palace three or four times a day, apart from that which the royal children gave, without ceasing a moment.
(300) There was constructed for me a pyramid-tomb of stone in the midst of the pyramid-tombs. The stonemasons who hew a pyramid-tomb took over its groundarea. The outline-draftsmen designed in it; the chief sculptors carved in it; and the overseers of works who are in the necropolis made it their concern. (305) Its necessary materials were made from all the outfittings which are placed at a tomb-shaft. Mortuary priests were given to me. There was made for me a necropolis garden, with fields in it formerly (extending) as far as the

town, like that which is done for a chief courtier. My statue was overlaid with gold, and its skirt was of fine gold. It was his majesty who had it made. There is no poor man for whom the like has been done. (So) I was under (310) the favor of the king's presence until the day of mooring had come.44
IT HAS COME (TO ITS END), FROM BEGINNING TO END AS IT HAD BEEN FOUND IN WRITING.
THE TAKING OF JOPPA
One of the important officers in the army of the empire-builder Thut-mose III (about 1490-1436 B.C.) was a certain Thoth (or Thuti), who has left us evidence of his responsible concern for the conquest and administration of foreign countries.1 His fame continued for some generations, as he appears as the hero in the following tale in a manuscript of the Nineteenth Dynasty (dated to about 1300 B.C.). Papyrus Harris 500, now 10060 in the British Museum, verso i-iii. The manuscript is said to have come from Thebes. Photograph in Facsimiles of Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Second Series, ed. by E. A. W. Budge (London, 1923), PI. XLVII. Transcription into hieroglyphic in A. H. Gardiner, Late-Egyptian Stories (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, 1, Brussels, 1932), 82-85. A study by H. P. Blok, De beide Vol\sverhalen van Papyrus Harris 500 Verso (Leyden, 1925) was reviewed by T. E. Peet, in JEA, xi (1925), 336-37. Translations by Peet, JEA, xi (1925), 225-27, and by Erman, LAE, 167-69. The language and style are relatively colloquial Late Egyptian, so that the following translation uses "you" instead of "thou," except in address of the gods. The beginning of the story is lost. One may assume that General Thoth has been besieging the port of loppa in Palestine and is conferring with the Prince of loppa to arrange some kind of terms.

So they guarded the horses and gave them feed.
44 Until the day of death. Gardiner has pointed out that the story resembles an autobiography prepared for a tomb wall, and "its nucleus may be derived from the tomb of a real Sinuhe, who led a life of adventure in Palestine and was subsequently buried at Lisht" (Notes on the Story of Sinuhe, 168).
1 On a gold bowl in the Louvre, Thoth is called: "the trusted man of the king in every foreign country and the islands which are in the midst of the Sea; he who fills the storehouses with lapis lazuli, silver, and gold; the Overseer of Foreign Countries; the Commander of the Army." On other materials belonging to Thoth, he is called: "the Follower of the King in Every Foreign Country"; "the trusted man of the King in God's Country," i.e. the East; "the Garrison Commander"; and "the Overseer of Northern Countries." See Scthe, Ur\unden der 18. Dynastie (Vr\., iv), iv, 999-1002. 2 Apparently the Indo-Iranian word for "nobles," used in Egyptian texts for Asiatic warriors, cf. pp. 237, n.43; 245, n.15; 246, n.28; 261; 262; and 477. 3 The inclusion of wife and children makes it reasonable to assume that Thoth was offering to go over to the side of Joppa. 4 The 'Apiru were foreigners, some of whom served the Egyptians at this time. For the probable connection of the term 'Apiru with the term appearing in cuneiform as Habtru, the latter being the assumed origin of the word "Hebrew," see J. A. Wilson, in AfSL, XLIX (1933), 275-80. Habiru was not an ethnic, and the present 'Apir was not a Hebrew as far as we have any evidence, cf. p. 247, n.47.

And [the Enemy of Joppa wanted to see the great staff of] King Men-kheper-Re5—life, prosperity, health!and they came and reported (this) to Thoth. Then [the Enemy of Jo]ppa said to Thoth: "I want to see the great staff of King Men-rkheper-Re—life, prosperity, health!— of [which] the name is . . -the-Beautiful.' By the \a of King Men-kheper-Re—life, prosperity, health!—if you have it today, (10) good, and bring it to me!" And he did so and brought the great staff of King Men-kheper-Re, [and he laid hold of] his cloak, and he stood upright, and said: "Look at me, O Enemy of [Joppa! Behold] the King Men-kheper-Re—life, prosperity, health!—the fierce Hon, the son of Sekhmet!8 Amon gave him his [victory]!" [And he] raised his [hand] and struck the Enemy of Joppa on the forehead. And he fell down, (ii 1) made [prostrate] before him. And he put him in fet[ters] .. . the leather. And he . . . pieces of metal, which [he had had made to] punish this Enemy of Joppa. And the piece of metal of four nemset (weight) was put on his feet7 And he had the two hundred baskets brought which he had had made, and he had two hundred soldiers get down (5) into them. And their arms were filled (with) bonds and fetters, and they were sealed up with seals. And they were given their sandals, as well as their carrying-poles and staves.8 And they had every good soldier carrying them, totaling five hundred men. And they were told: "When you enter the city, you are to let out your companions and lay hold on all the people who are in the city and put them in bonds (10) immediately."
And they went out to tell the charioteer of the Enemy of Joppa:" "Thus speaks your lord: 'Go and tell your mistress:10 "Rejoice, for Seth11 has given us Thoth, along with his wife and his children! See the vanguard of their tribute." (You) shall tell her about these two hundred baskets,'" which were filled with men with fetters and bonds.12
Then he went ahead of them to bring the good news to his mistress, saying: "We-have captured Thoth!" And they opened the locks of the city before the soldiers, (iii 1) And they entered the city [and] let out their companions. And they laid hold [on the] city, small

However, the point of the deception would then be lost. More likely the phrase is a parenthesis of the storyteller: Tell her about these two hundred baskets—supposedly filled with tribute, but actually filled with Egyptian soldiers.

Send men to take them away as plunder, so that you may fill the House of your father Amon-Re, King of the Gods, with male and female slaves, who are fallen under your feet forever and ever!"

THE STORY OF TWO BROTHERS
This folk tale tells how a conscientious young man was falsely accused of a proposal of adultery by the wife of his elder brother, after he had actually rejected her advances. This part of the story has general similarity to the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. The two chief characters are brothers named Anubis and Bata. These were the names of Egyptian gods, and the tale probably does have a mythological setting. However, it served for entertainment, rather than ecclesiastical or moral purpose. The story is colloquial and is so translated. Papyrus D'Orbiney is now British Museum 10183. Facsimiled in Select Papyri in the Hieratic Character from the Collections of the British Museum, 11 (London, i860), Pis. IX-XIX, and in G. Möller, Hieratische Lesestücket 11 (Leipzig, 1927), 1-20. The manuscript can be closely dated to about 1225 B.C. in the Nineteenth Dynasty. Transcription into hieroglyphic in A. H. Gardiner, Late-Egyptian Stories (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, 1, Brussels, 1932), 9-29. Translation in Erman, LAE, 150-61.*
N O W THEY SAY THAT (ONCE) THERE WERE tWO b r o t h e r s
of one mother and one father. Anubis was the name of the elder, and Bata1 was the name of the younger. Now, as for Anubis, he [had] a house and had a wife, [and] his younger brother (lived) with him as a sort of minor. He was the one who made clothes for him and went to the fields driving his cattle. He was the one who did the plowing and who harvested for him. He was the one who did all (kinds of) work for him which are in the fields. Really, his younger [brother] was a good (grown) man. There was no one like him in the entire land. Why, the strength of a god was in him.
[ N o w ] AFTER M A N Y DAYS AFTER THIS,2 his younger
brother (5) [was tending] his cattle in his custom of every [day], and he [left off] (to go) to his house every evening, loaded [with] all (kinds of) plants of the field, [with] milk, with wood, and [with] every [good thing of] the fields, and he laid them in front of his [elder brother], who was sitting with his wife. And he drank and he ate, and [he went out to sleep in] his stable among his cattle [by himself].

his elder brother. [And he] gave him bread for the fields. And he drove his cattle out to let them feed in the fields. He went along after his cattle, [and] they would say to him: "The grass [of] such-and-such a place is good," and he would understand whatever they said and would take them to the place (ii 1) of good grass which they wanted. So the cattle which were before him became very, very fine. They doubled their calving very, very much. Now AT THE TIME OF plowing his [elder] brother said to him: "Get a yoke [of oxen] ready for us for plowing, for the fields have come out, and it is fine for plowing. Also come to the fields with seed, for we shall be busy (with) plowing [in] the morning." So he spoke to him. T H E N [his] (5) younger brother did all the things which his elder brother had told him to [do].
N o w WHEN IT WAS DAWN [AND A SECOND] DAY HAD
COME, they went to the fields with their [seed], and they were busy [with] plowing, and [their hearts] were very, very pleased with their activity at the beginning of [their] work.
N o w [AFTER] M A N Y [DAYS] AFTER THIS,2 they were in
the fields and ran short of seed. T H E N HE sent his younger brother, saying: "Go and fetch us seed from the village." And his younger brother found the wife of his elder brother sitting and doing her hair. T H E N HE said to her: "Get up and give me (some) seed, (iii 1) for my younger3 brother is waiting for me. Don't delay!" T H E N SHE said to him: "Go and open the bin and take what you want! Don't make me leave my combing unfinished!" T H E N the lad went into his stable, and he took a big jar, for he wanted to carry off a lot of seed. So he loaded himself with barley and emmer and came out carrying them.
T H E N SHE said to him: "How much (is it) that is on your shoulder?" [And he] said to her: (5) "THREE sacks of emmer, two sacks of barley, FIVE IN ALL, is what is on your shoulder."4 So he spoke to her. T H E N SHE [talked with] him, saying "There is [great] strength in you! Now I see your energies every day!" And she wanted to know him as one knows a man. T H E N SHE stood up and took hold of him and said to him: "Come, let's spend an [hour] sleeping (together)! This will do you good, because I shall make fine clothes for you!" T H E N the lad [became] like a leopard with [great] rage at the wicked suggestion which she had made to him, and she was very, very much frightened. T H E N HE argued with her, saying: "See here—you are like a mother to me, and your husband is like a father to me! Because—being older than I—he was the one who brought me up. What (iv 1) is this great crime which you have said to me? Don't say it to me again! And I won't tell it to a single person, nor will I let it out of my mouth to any man!" And he lifted up his load, and he went to the fields. T H E N HE reached his elder brother, and they were busy with activity (at) their work.
8 Sic, but read "elder."
4 Sic, but read "my shoulder." He was carrying more than u bushels.
N o w AT THE [TIME] OF EVENING, THEN his elder
brother left off (to go) to his house. And his younger brother tended his cattle, and [he] loaded himself with everything of the fields, and he took his cattle (5) in front of him, to let them sleep (in) their stable which was in the village. But the wife of his elder brother was afraid (because of) the suggestion which she had made. T H E N SHE took fat and grease,5 and she became like one who has been criminally beaten, wanting to tell her husband: "It was your younger brother who did the beating!" And her husband left off in the evening, after his custom of every day, and he reached his house, and he found his wife lying down, terribly sick. She did not put water on his hands, after his custom, nor had she lit a light before him, and his house was in darkness, and she lay (there) vomiting. So her husband said to her: "Who has been talking with you?" Then she said to him: "Not one person has been talking with me except your (v 1) younger brother. But when he came [to] take the seed to you he found me sitting alone, and he said to me: 'Come, let's spend an hour sleeping (together)! Put on your curls!'6 So he spoke to me. But I wouldn't listen to him: 'Aren't I your mother?—for your elder brother is like a father to you!' So I spoke to him. But he was afraid, and he beat (me), so as not to let me tell you. Now, if you let him live, I'll kill myself! Look, when he comes, don't [let him speak], for, if I accuse (him of) this wicked suggestion, he will be ready to do it tomorrow (again)!"
T H E N his elder brother became (5) like a leopard, and he made his lance sharp, and he put it in his hand. T H E N his elder (brother) stood behind the door (of) his stable to kill his younger brother when he came back in the evening to put his cattle in the stable. Now when the sun was setting, he loaded himself (with) all plants of the fields, according to his custom of every day, and he came back. When the first cow came into the stable, she said to her herdsman: "Here's your elder brother waiting before you, carrying his lance to kill you! Run away from him!" T H E N HE understood what his first cow had said. And (vi 1) another went in, and she said the same. So he looked under the door of his stable, and he saw the feet of [his] elder brother, as he was waiting behind the door, with his lance in his hand. So he laid his load on the ground, and he started to run away and escape. And his elder brother went after him, carrying his lance. T H E N his younger brother prayed to the Re-Harakhti, (5) saying: "O my good lord, thou art he who judges the wicked from the just!" Thereupon the Re heard all his pleas, and the Re made a great (body of) water appear between him and his elder (brother), and it was full of crocodiles. So one of them came to be on one side and the other on the other. And his elder brother struck his hand twice because of his not killing him. T H E N his younger brother called to him from the

N o w W H E N IT WAS DAWN AND A SECOND DAY HAD COME,
the Re-Har-akhti arose, and one of them saw the other. T H E N the lad argued with his elder brother, saying: "What do you (mean by) coming after me to kill (me) falsely, when you wouldn't listen to what I had to say ? Now I am still your younger brother, and (5) you are like a father to me, and your wife is like a mother to me! Isn't it so? When I was sent to fetch us (some) seed, your wife said to me: 'Come, let's spend an hour sleeping (together)!' But, look, it is twisted for you into something else!" T H E N HE let him know all that had happened to him and his wife. T H E N HE swore to the Re-Har-akhti, saying "As for your killing (me) falsely, you carried your lance on the word of a filthy whore!" And he took a reed-knife, and he cut off his phallus, and he threw it into the water. And the shad swallowed (it).8 And he (viii 1) was faint and became weak. And his elder brother's heart was very, very sad, and he stood weeping aloud for him. He could not cross over to where his younger brother was because of the crocodiles....
T H E N (the younger brother) went (7) off to the Valley of the Cedar, and his elder brother went off to his house, with his hand laid upon his head, and he was smeared with dust." So he reached his house, and he killed his wife, and he threw her out (to) the dogs. And he sat in mourning for his younger brother.... (The story continues with a number of episodes. The gods fashion a wife for the self-exiled Bata, but she has a wandering eye, and the Valley of the Cedar does not give her enough scope. She is taken to the Egyptian court, where she contrives the destruction of her husband. However, the elder brother, Anubis, receives a magic sign, journeys to the Valley of the Cedar, and brings Bata back to life. Bata assumes various forms, follows his wife to Pharaoh's court, and thwarts her contrivings. In a magic way, she conceives a son by Bata. This son, who is Bata himself, is accepted by Pharaoh as the Crown Prince. When Pharaoh dies, he succeeds to the throne.)

THE JOURNEY OF WEN-AMON TO PHOENICIA
When the Egyptian Empire disintegrated, it left a vacuum in its place for a generation or two. Egyptians, Asiatics, and Africans continued to think in terms of an authority which was no longer real. In the following tale Egypt had already become a "bruised reed" but was continuing to assert traditional expressions of dominance. The Asiatics were beginning to express their scepticism and their independence of their great neighbor to the south. The story is almost picaresque in its atmosphere and must be classed as a narrative. Nevertheless, it deals at close range with actual individuals and situations and must have had a basis of fact, here exaggerated by the conscious and unconscious humor of the narrator. It does represent the situation in Hither Asia about 1100 B.C. more tellingly than a document of the historicalpropagandistic category could do. Wen-Amon, an official of the Temple of Amon at Karnak, tells how he was sent to Byblos on the Phoenician coast to procure lumber for the ceremonial barge of the god. Egypt had already split into small states and did not support his mission with adequate purchasing value, credentials, or armed force. The papyrus, now in the Moscow Museum, comes from elHibeh in Middle Egypt and dates to the early Twenty-first Dynasty ( n t h century B.C.), shortly after the events it relates. A transcript of some of the hieratic text may be seen in G. Möller, Hieratische LesestUc^e, 11 (Leipzig, 1927), 29. The original publication, out of his own collection, was by W. Golenischeff, in Recueil de travaux . . . , xxi (1899), 74-102. Transcription into hieroglyphic is in A. H. Gardiner, Late-Egyptian Stories (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, 1, Brussels, 1932), 61-76. A. Erman published a translation in ZAeS, xxxvm (1900), 1-14, and again in LAE, 174-85. The present translation profited by photographs of the manuscript. The text is written in the colloquial of Late-Egyptian and is so translated.*

I reached Dor, a town of the Tjeker, and Beder, its prince, had 50 loaves of bread, one jug of wine, (10) and one leg of beef brought to me.5 And a man of my ship ran away and stole one [vessel] of gold, [amounting] to 5 deben, four jars of silver, amounting to 20 deben, and a sack of 11 deben of silver. [Total of what] he [stole]: 5 deben of gold and 31 deben of silver.8 I got up in the morning, and I went to the place where the Prince was, and I said to him: "I have been robbed in your harbor. Now you are the prince of this land, and you are its investigator who should look for my silver. Now about this silver—it belongs to Amon-Re, (15) King of the Gods, the lord of the lands; it belongs to Ne-su-Ba-neb-Ded; it belongs to Heri-Hor, my lord, and the other great men of Egypt! It belongs to you; it belongs to Weret; it belongs to Mekmer; it belongs to Zakar-Baal, the Prince of Byblos!"7 And he said to me: "Whether you are important or whether you are eminent—look here, I do not recognize this accusation which you have made to me! Suppose it had been a thief who belonged to my land who went on your boat and stole your silver, I should have repaid it to you from my treasury, until they had (20) found this thief of yours—whoever he may be. Now about the thief who robbed you—he belongs to you! He belongs to your ship! Spend a few days here visiting me, so that I may look for him."

2 Ne-su-Ba-neb-Ded was the dt facto ruler of the Delta, with Tanis as his capital. Ta-net-Amon was apparently his wife. At Thebes in Upper Egypt, the High Priest of Amon, Heri-Hor, was the de facto ruler. Ne-su-Ba-neb-Ded and Heri-Hor were in working relations with each other, and were shortly to become contemporary pharaohs. 8 Irreconcilable with the date first given.

The Tjeker ( = Teukroi?) were one of the Sea Peoples associated with the Philistines in the great movements of the 15th to 12th centuries B.C. cf. p. 262. Their
prince, Beder, considers it still necessary to show honor to an emissary from Egypt. ' T h i s value—about 450 grams (1.2 lb. Troy) of gold and about 2.8 kilograms (7.5 lb. Troy) of silver—was to pay for the lumber. T On the one hand, the gold and silver belong to the Egyptians who sent Wen-Amon. On the other hand, they belong to the Asiatics who would receive it. Beder thus has double responsibilities to recover them. 8 The remainder of Beder's speech is badly broken but seems to combine reassurance and delay. Wen-Amon was apparently impatient, for the end of the broken context finds him in Tyre.

He is the one who made him come!" And while the possessed (youth) was having his frenzy on this night, I had (already) found a ship headed for Egypt and had loaded everything that I had into it. While I was watching for the darkness, thinking that when it descended I would load the god (also), so that no other eye might see him, the harbor master came to me, saying: "Wait until morning—so says the Prince." So I said to him: "Aren't you the one who spend the time coming to me every day to say: 'Get out (of) my harbor' ? Aren't you saying 'Wait* tonight (45) in order to let the ship which I have found get away—and (then) you will come again (to) say: 'Go away!'?" So he went and told it to the Prince. And the Prince sent to the captain of the ship to say:" Wait until morning—so says the Prince!"
When MORNING CAME, he sent and brought me up, but the god stayed in the tent where he was, (on) the shore of the sea. And I found him sitting (in) his upper room, with his back turned to a window, so that the waves of the great Syrian sea broke against the back (50) of his head.14 So I said to him: "May Amon favor you!"

9 Somewhere in this break or in one of those which follow there was the statement of Wen-Amon's arrival at Byblos (Gebal) on the Phoenician
coast. 10 Nearly the same amount as the silver which had been stolen from him, without account of the gold. 11 It is by no means certain that Wen-Amon appropriated this silver from the Tjeker. However, the restoration of the Tjeker in this context helps to explain their vengeful attitude l a t a in the story (n 62 ff.). 12 Or "inside it," the tent. Jtpt as images of gods led the Egyptian armies into battle, so the emissary of the temple had an idol, a "traveling Amon," to make his mission successful. The restoration '1 hid" depends in part on a later statement that Amon-of-the-Road was to be withheld from public view. The divine image would have its daily cult and therefore its cultic apparatus. If the translation above is correct, this apparatus was stored within the hollow image. 12 "A great boy of his great boys," perhaps a court page, was seized with a prophetic frenzy. The determinative of the word "(prophetically) possessed" shows a human figure in violent motion or epileptic convulsion. 14 Pictorially, not literally. Wen-Amon gives his vivid first view of Zakar-Baal, framed in an upper window overlooking the surf of the Mediterranean, cL H. Schafer, in OLZ, xxxn (1929), 812-19.

And I told him: "I gave them to Ne-su-Ba-nebDed and Ta-net-Amon." And he was very, very angry, and he said to me: "Now see—neither letters nor dispatches are in your hand!

So I told him: "I have come after the woodwork for the great and august barque of AmonRe, King of the Gods. Your father did (it), (5) your grandfather did (it), and you will do it too!" So I spoke to him. But he said to me: " T o be sure, they did it! And if you give me (something) for doing it, I will do it! Why, when my people carried out this commission, Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health!—sent six ships loaded with Egyptian goods, and they unloaded them into their storehouses! You—what is it that you're bringing me—me also?" And he had the journal rolls of his fathers brought, and he had them read out in my presence, and they found a thousand deben of silver and all kinds of things in his scrolls.
(10) So he said to me: "If the ruler of Egypt were the lord of mine, and I were his servant also, he would not have to send silver and gold, saying: 'Carry out the commission of Amon!' There would be no carrying of a royal-gift,20 such as they used to do for my father. As
15 Wen-Amon's courteous salutation is set in contrast with the businesslike brusqueness of the Phoenician. 18 Zakar-Baal feels that Ne-su-Ba-neb-Ded has scarcely acted in good faith in permitting Wen-Amon to come without proper credentials. He argues that the Delta ruler had turned Wen-Amon over to a non-Egyptian sailor, so that Wen-Amon and "Amon-of-the-Road" might disappear without a trace. 17 A Semitic word for established trade contacts. 18 Werket-El or Warkatara (cf. J AOS, L X X I , 260) an Asiatic merchant living in Egypt, trading regularly with Sidon? "Drawn to his house" would mean either drawn up on the shore at his Sidonian office or towed along the waterways of Egypt. 19 Wen-Amon's wording shows his inability to answer Zakar-Baal's charge that there had been plenty of opportunity to supply him with credit and credentials. 20 A Semitic word written m-r-K, either derived from mde\ "king," or from Canaanite mulku "royalty, dominion" (JAOS, L X X I , 261).

for me—me also—I am not your servant! I am not the servant of him who sent you either! If I cry out to the Lebanon, the heavens open up, and the logs are here lying (on) the shore of the sea!21 Give (15) me the sails which you have brought to carry your ships which would hold the logs for (Egypt)! Give me the ropes [which] you have brought \to lash the cedar] logs which I am to cut down to make you — which I shall make for you (as) the sails of your boats, and the spars will be (too) heavy and will break, and you will die in the middle of the sea!22 See, Amon made thunder in the sky when he put Seth near him.28 Now when Amon (20) founded all lands, in founding them he founded first the land of Egypt, from which you come; for craftsmanship came out of it, to reach the place where I am, and learning came out of it, to reach the place where I am. What are these silly trips which they have had you make?"24 And I said to him: "(That's) not true! What I am on are no 'silly trips' at all! There is no ship upon the River which does not belong to Amon! The sea is his, and the Lebanon is his, of which you say: 'It is mine!' It forms (25) the nursery for User-het-Amon, the lord of [every] ship!25 Why, he spoke—Amon-Re, King of the Gods—and said to Heri-Hor, my master: 'Send me forth!' So he had me come, carrying this great god. But see, you have made this great god spend these twenty-nine days moored (in) your harbor, although you did not know (it). Isn't he here ? Isn't he the (same) as he was? You are stationed (here) to carry on the commerce of the Lebanon with Amon, its lord.*As for your saying that the former kings sent silver and goldsuppose that they had life and health; (then) they would not have had such things sent! (30) (But) they had such things sent to your fathers in place of life and health!28 Now as for Amon-Re, King of the Gods—he is the lord of this life and health, and he was the lord of your fathers. They spent their lifetimes making offering to Amon. And you also—you are the servant of Amon! If you say to Amon: 'Yes, I will do (it)!' and you carry out his commission, you will live, you will be prosperous, you will be healthy, and you will be good to your entire land and your people! (But) don't wish for yourself anything belonging to Amon-Re, (King of) the Gods. Why, a lion wants his own property!27 Have your secretary brought to me, so that (35) I may send him to Ne-su-Ba-neb-Ded and Ta-net-Amon, the officers*
21 In Zakar-Baal's boast of independent power, he can make it rain logs. 22 Zakar-Baal's argument is not clear here. Perhaps: you have no proper exchange value to pay for the cedar; if I take the tackle of your ships, you will not be able to sail back to Egypt. 28 As god of thunder (p. 17, n.27 above; JAOS, L X X I , 261). Thus Amon and Seth were gods of all lands, not of Egypt alone. 24 In contrasting Wen-Amon's meager mission with the glory ot the Egyptian past, Zakar-Baal makes the remarkable statement that the god Amon founded (setded, first equipped) all lands, but Egypt first of all, and that skilled craftsmanship (technique) and learning (wisdom, education) had come to his land from Egypt. 25 The Lebanon is merely the "growing-place" for the sacred barque of Amon. 28 In contrast with the past, Wen-Amon has brought an actual god in "Amon-of-the-Road," so that there may be spiritual rather than material advantages for Zakar-Baal. 2T Perhaps a proverb.

whom Amon put in the north of his land, and they will have all kinds of things sent. I shall send him to them to say: 'Let it be brought until I shall go (back again) to the south, and I shall (then) have every bit of the debt still (due to you) brought to you.'" So I spoke to him.28 So he entrusted my letter to his messenger, and he loaded in the keel, the bow-post, the stern-post, along with four other hewn timbers—seven in all—and he had them taken to Egypt.29 And in the first month of the second season his messenger who had gone to Egypt came back to me in Syria. And Ne-su-Ba-neb-Ded and Ta-net-Amon sent: (40) 4 jars and 1 kakrmen °f gold; 5 jars of silver; 10 pieces of clothing in royal linen; 10 kherd of good Upper Egyptian linen; 500 (rolls of) finished papyrus*500 cowhides; 500 ropes; 20 sacks of lentils; and 30 baskets of fish. And she80 sent to me (personally): 5 pieces of clothing in good Upper Egyptian linen; 5 \herd of good Upper Egyptian linen; 1 sack of lentils; and 5 baskets of fish. And the Prince was glad, and he detailed three hundred men and three hundred catde, and he put supervisors at their head, to have them cut down the timber. So they cut them down, and they spent the second season lying there.81 In the third month of the third season they dragged them (to) the shore of the sea, and the Prince came out and stood by them. And he sent to me, (45) saying: "Come!" Now when I presented myself near him, the shadow of his lotus-blossom fell upon me. And PenAmon, a butler who belonged to him, cut me off, saying: "The shadow of Pharaoh— life, prosperity, health!your lord, has fallen on you!" But he was angry at him, saying: "Let him alone!"82 So I presented myself near him, and he answered and said to me: "See, the commission which my fathers carried out formerly, I have carried it out (also), even though you have not done for me what your fathers would have done for me, and you too (should have done)! See, the last of your woodwork has arrived and is lying (here). Do as I wish, and come to load it infor aren't they going to give it to you ? (50) Don't come to look at the terror of the sea! If you look at the terror of the sea, you will see my own (too) !88 Why, I have not done to you what was done to the messengers of
28 Wen-Amon proposes that Zakar-Baal appeal to Ne-su-Ba-neb-Ded to advance the payment against Wen-Amon's ultimate return to Egypt. 29 Zakar-Baal was sufficiently trustful to advance some of the timbers for the barque of Amon. 80 Ta-net-Amon. 81 Seasoning in the mountains. 81 The meaning of the butler's grim jest is lost to us. The word "lotusblossom" has the determinative of a lotus leaf and also a hide. It probably was a sunshade of lotus design. At any rate, the shadow of something personal belonging to Zakar-Baal accidentally fell upon Wen-Amon. Zakar-Baal's butler, whose name should make him an Egyptian, steps in to cut Wen-Amon off from this shadow and maliciously says that it is the shadow of pharaoh of Egypt. Zakar-Baal cuitly tells the buder not to pursue the matter. Perhaps we have to do with the blight of majesty. The butler's jest has point if the shadow of pharaoh was too intimate and holy to fall upon a commoner. Or see A. L. Oppenheim in BASOR, no. 107 (1947), 7 - " · 88 If you use wind or weather as excuses far delay, you will find me just as dangerous.
Kha-em-Waset, when they spent seventeen years in this land—they died (where) they were!"84 And he said to his butler: "Take him and show him their tomb in which they are lying." But I said to him: "Don't show it to me! As for Khaem-Waset—they were men whom he sent to you as messengers, and he was a man himself.85 You do not have one of his messengers (here in me), when you say: 'Go and see your companions!' Now, shouldn't you rejoice (55) and have a stela [made] for yourself and say on it: 'Amon-Re, King of the Gods, sent to me Amon-of-the-Road, his messenger—[life], prosperity, health!—and Wen-Amon, his human messenger, after the woodwork for the great and august barque of Amon-Re, King of the Gods. I cut it down. I loaded it in. I provided it (with) my ships and my crews. I caused them to reach Egypt, in order to ask fifty years of life from Amon for myself, over and above my fate.' And it shall come to pass that, after another time, a messenger may come from the land of Egypt who knows writing, and he may read your name on the stela. And you will receive water (in) the West, like the gods who are (60) here!"88 And he said to me: "This which you have said to me is a great testimony of words!"87 So I said to him: "As for the many things which you have said to me, if I reach the place where the High Priest of Amon is and he sees how you have (carried out this) commission, it is your (carrying out of this) commission (which) will draw out something for you." And I went (to) the shore of the sea, to the place where the timber was lying, and I spied eleven ships belonging to the Tjeker coming in from the sea, in order to say: " Arrest him! Don't let a ship of his (go) to the land of Egypt!" Then I sat down and wept. And the letter scribe of the Prince came out to me, (65) and he said to me: "What's the matter with you?" And I said to him: "Haven't you seen the birds go down to Egypt a second time ?88 Look at them— how they travel to the cool pools! (But) how long shall I be left here! Now don't you see those who are coming again to arrest me?" So he went and told it to the Prince. And the Prince began to weep because of the words which were said to him, for they were painful. And he sent out to me his letter scribe, and he brought to me two jugs of wine and one ram. And he sent to me Ta-net-Not, an Egyptian singer who was with him,89 saying: "Sing to him! Don't let his heart take on cares!" And he sent to me, (70) to say: "Eat and drink! Don't let your heart take on
84 We do not know who this Kha-em-Waset was. This was one of the names of Ramses IX, but is not here written as royal. The same pharaoh had a vizier of this name, which was quite common in Thebes at the time. At any rate, there is an implicit threat in the reference. 85 This should rule out the possibility that Kha-em-Waset was Ramses IX, as Wen-Amon would probably not refer to a pharaoh a "a man." 88 A libation to help maintain the dead. 87 We cannot be sure whether the irony was conscious or unconscious. 88 Wen-Amon had been away from Egypt for more than a year, seeing two flights of birds southward. 89 Egyptian women who entertained or participated in cult ceremonies in Asia are known, for example, in the inscriptions on the Megiddo ivories (p. 263 below), cf. also p. 246, n.30.

cares, for tomorrow you shall hear whatever I have to say." When morning came, he had his assembly40 summoned, and he stood in their midst, and he said to the Tjeker: "What have you come (for) ?" And they said to him: "We have come after the blasted ships which you are sending to Egypt with our opponents!"41 But he said to them: "I cannot arrest the messenger of Amon inside my land. Let me send him away, and you go after him to arrest him."42 So he loaded me in, and he sent me away from there at the harbor of the sea. And the wind cast me on the land of (75) Alashiya.48 And they of the town came out against me to kill me, but I forced my way through them to the place where Heteb, the princess of the town, was. I met her as she was going out of one house of hers and going into another of hers. So I greeted her, and I said to the people who were standing near her: "Isn't there one of you who understands Egyptian?" And one of them said: "I understand (it)." So I said to him: "Tell my lady that I have heard, as far away as Thebes, the place where Amon is, that injustice is done in every town but justice is done in the land of Alashiya.44 Yet injustice is done here every day!" And she said: "Why, what do you (mean) (80) by saying it?" So I told her: "If the sea is stormy and the wind casts me on the land where you are, you should not let them take me in charge to kill me. For I am a messenger of Amon. Look here—as for me, they will search for me all the time! As to this crew of the Prince of Byblos which they are bent on killing, won't its lord find ten crews of yours, and he also kill them ?" So she had the people summoned, and they stood (there). And she said to me: "Spend the n i g h t . . . " (At this point the papyrus breaks off. Since the tale is told in the first person, it is fair to assume that WenAmon returned to Egypt to tell his story, in some measure of safety or success.)
THE LEGEND OF THE POSSESSED PRINCESS
This text is a pious forgery of the end of the pharaonic period. The priests of a temple at Karnak wished to enlarge the fame of their god, composed a circumstantial tale of his ancient success as a healer, cast the tale back into the reign of Ramses II, and installed the inscription in their temple. Ramses II had reigned in the 13th century B.C., whereas this text may have come from the 4th or 3rd century B.C. However, it drew successfully on traditional elements of Egypt's past: the far reach of the Egyptian Empire, the reputation of Egyptian physicians in other countries, and the marriage of Ramses II to the daughter of the Hittite king.
40 The word used is the same as Hebrew m&ed. e.g. Num. 16:2. cf. J. A. Wilson, in JNES, rv (1945) 245. 41 "The belabored, belabored ships which you send to Egypt by our companions of quarreling." This either means that Wen-Amon's ships should be smashed up or is an abusive term like English "blasted." 42 Zakar-Baal's apparently cynical abandonment of Wen-Amon has its jurisdictional justification, since Wen-Amon's appropriation of Tjeker property apparently took place somewhere between Tyre and Byblos. 43 Egyptian 1-r-s, probably Cyprus. 44 Diplomatic exaggeration, rather than a quotation.

Now his majesty was in Naharin2 according to his custom of every year, while the princes of every foreign country were come, bowing down in peace to the glory of his majesty (from) as far away as the marshlands. Their tribute of gold, [silver], lapis lazuli, (5) turquoise, and all the woods of God's Land3 was on their backs, each one leading his fellow. Then the Prince of Bekhten4 caused that his tribute be brought, and he set his eldest daughter at the head thereof, giving honor to his majesty and asking [the breath] from him. And the woman was exceedingly pleasing to the heart of his majesty, beyond anything. Then her name was formally fixed as: the Great King's Wife, Nefru-Re.8 When his majesty reached Egypt, she fulfilled every function (of) King's Wife.
It happened that, in the year 23, 2nd month of the third season, day 22,8 while his majesty was in Thebes, the Victorious, the Mistress of Cities, performing the ceremonies of his father Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, at his beautiful Feast of Southern Opet,7 the place of his heart's (desire) of the first times, one came to say to his majesty: "There is a messenger of the Prince of Bekhten who has come bearing much tribute for the King's Wife." Then he was introduced into the presence of his majesty with his tribute. He said, in giving honor to his majesty: "Praise to thee, O Re of the Nine Bows! Behold, we live through thee!" Then he spoke and kissed the ground before his majesty. He spoke again in the presence of his majesty: "I have come to thee, O sovereign, my lord, on behalf of Bint

The Hittite king sent his daughter at the head of abundant tribute. She pleased the king very much, and he fixed her formal name as "the King's Wife Maat-nefru-Re." The similarity of situation and name in our text is more than a coincidence. The priestly editor drew upon a remembered past. 6 The dates in this text are so carefully constructed as to appear circumstantial.

Then his majesty said: "Bring me the staff of the House of Life and the official body (10) of the Residence."9 (They) were ushered in to him immediately. His majesty said: "Behold, ye have been summoned so that ye may hear this matter. Now bring me from amongst you one skilled in his heart, who can write with his fingers." So the Royal Scribe Thut-em-heb came into the presence of his majesty, and his majesty commanded that he go to Bekhten with this messenger.10 So the wise man arrived in Bekhten, and he found Bint-resh in the condition of one possessed of spirits. Indeed, he found an enemy with whom to contend. And the Prince of Bekhten again [sent to] his majesty, saying: "O sovereign, my lord, grant that his majesty command that a god be brought [to contend with this spirit." This message came] to his majesty in the year 26, ist month of the third season, at the time of the Feast of Amon,11 when his majesty was in Thebes. Then his majesty repeated (it) in the presence of Khonsu-in-Thebes-Nefer-hotep,12 saying: "O my good lord, I act again before thee on behalf of the daughter of the Prince of Bekhten." Then Khonsu-in-ThebesNefer-hotep was conducted to Khonsu-the-Carrier-outof-Plans, the great god, who expels disease-demons.18 Then his majesty said before Khonsu-in-Thebes-Neferhotep: "O my good lord, if thou turnest thy face toward Khonsu-(i5)the-Carrier-out-of-Plans, the great god, who expels disease-demons, he will be made to go to Bekhten."

8 A name bearing the consonants of this name, but with unknown vocalization, appears in the Aramaic papyri of Persian times found at Elephantine. The present vocalization Bint—"daughter of"—may be unjustified. 9 A. H. Gardiner, in JEA, xxiv (1938), 157 ff., says that the "House of Life" was "a scriptorium where books connected with religion and cognate matters were compiled." The pharaoh was summoning the best advice on a matter of religion, magic, and medicine. 10 Egyptian physicians were held in respect in the ancient world. In the time of Darius an Egyptian doctor, was sent by that king from one country to another to teach his medical and magical lore; see G. Posener, La premiere domination perse en tgypte (Cairo, 1936), 1 ff. The cuneiform documents from Bogazkoy provide earlier evidence of this demand; see A. H. Sayce in the journal Ancient Egypt, 1922, 67-68. 11 This is about 35 months after the date against n.6 above. The text against n.17 below will indicate that the journey from Egypt to Bekhten took 17 months. Thus the 35 months provides die time for a round trip, including Thut-em-heb's unsuccessful mission in Bekhten. 12 "Khonsu in Thebes, Good of Peace," was the name of the chief manifestation of Khonsu and his name as a member of the Theban triad of Amon, Mut, and Khonsu. 18 This entrepreneur Khonsu was apparendy a subordinate form of Khonsu, who "did plans" to meet specific demands. One such function was the exorcism of disease, called "making distant the wanderers," or "strange intruders," or "demons of disease." He had a temple east of the great Amon enclosure at Karnak, not far from the temple of Khonsu-inThebes-Nefer-hotep. On his name, see ZAeS, LVIII (1923), 156-57. 14 "Nodding" was the affirmative response of the oracle of the god Khonsu. The scene at the top of this stela shows this god being carried by priests in his ornate barque, in which he undoubtedly traveled to visit the other Khonsu. The oracle was given either by a visible forward bending of the image of the god or by the priesdy interpretation of such signs. On the oracular role of Egyptian deities see pp. 448-449 below; A. M. Blackman, in JEA, xi (1925), 249-55; XII (1926), 176-85; J. Cerny, in BIFAO, xxx (1930), 491 ff.; xxxv (1935), 41 ff. " T h e god.

daughter of the Prince of Bekhten." (There was) very much nodding of the head of Khonsu-in-Thebes-Neferhotep. Then he made magical protection for Khonsuthe-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes four times.16 His majesty commanded that Khonsu-the-Carrier-out-of-Plansin-Thebes be taken to a great barque, five river-boats, and many chariots and horses (of) the west and the east This god arrived in Bekhten in the completion of one year and five months.17 Then the Prince of Bekhten came, with his army and his officials, before Khonsu-theCarrier-out-of-Plans, and he placed himself upon his belly, saying: "Thou hast come to us. Mayest thou be merciful to us, by the command of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re!" Then this god went to the place where Bint-resh was. Then he made magical protection for the daughter of the Prince of Bekhten, that she might become well immediately. Then this spirit which was with her said in the presence of Khonsu-the-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes: "Welcome, O great god who expels disease-demons! Bekhten is thy home, its people are thy slaves, and I am thy slave! (20) I shall go to the place from which I came, in order to set thy heart at rest about that for which thou hast come. But may thy majesty command to celebrate a holiday with me and with the Prince of Bekhten."18 Then this god nodded to his prophet,19 saying: "Let the Prince of Bekhten make a great offering in the presence of this spirit." Now while these things which Khonsu-the-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes did with the spirit were (taking place), the Prince of Bekhten was waiting with his soldiers, and he was very frightened. Then he made a great offering in the presence of Khonsu-the-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes and this spirit, the Prince of Bekhten celebrating a holiday on their behalf. Then the spirit went peacefully to the place which he wished, by the command of Khonsu-the-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes, while the Prince of Bekhten was rejoicing very much, together with every man who was in Bekhten. Then he schemed with his heart, saying: "I will cause this god to stay here in Bekhten. I will not let him go (back) to Egypt." Then this god tarried for three years and nine months in Bekhten. Then, while the Prince of Bekhten was sleeping on his bed, he saw this god coming to him, outside of his shrine. He was a falcon of gold, and he flew (up) to the sky and (off) to Egypt. And (25) he awoke in a panic. Then he said to the
18 "Four times" was a customary tag indicating the prescribed number of recitations to make magic effective. This shows that the "magical protection" was a conferred spiritual power, rather than such a visible element as an amulet. 17 The journey from Egypt to Bekhten, by water and land, took 17 months. 18 The spirit which possessed the princess bargained for formal recognition through a festival before he would leave the princess. 19 The image of the god was accompanied and served by a priest, whose tide we conventionally render "prophet." In the scene at the top of the stela, this individual is depicted censing the barque of his god, with the legend: "The name of the prophet and priest of Khonsu-the-Carrier-outof-Plans-in-Thebes (is) Khonsu-het-neter-neb." An individual of this name is known at the very end of the Egyptian Empire: JEA, xxvn (1941), 70.

prophet of Khonsu-the-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes: "This god is (still) here with us. He should go (back) to Egypt. So let his chariot go to Egypt." Then the Prince of Bekhten let this god proceed to Egypt, after he had been given very much tribute of every good thing, and very many soldiers and horses. They arrived successfully in Thebes. Then Khonsuthe-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes went to the House of Khonsu-in-Thebes-Nefer-hotep, to set the tribute of every good thing which the Prince of Bekhten had given him before Khonsu-in-Thebes-Nefer-hotep, (but) without his delivering everything thereof into his House.20 Khonsu-the-Carrier-out-of-Plans-in-Thebes arrived successfully at his (own) House in the year 33, 2nd month of the second season, day 19,21 of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re, for whom "given-life" is made, like Re forever.
THE TRADITION OF SEVEN LEAN YEARS IN EGYPT
The prosperity of Egypt depends upon the satisfactory flow of the Nile, particularly upon its annual inundation, and that river is antic and unpredictable. Ancient Egyptian texts have frequent references to hunger, "years of misery," "a year of low Nile," and so on.1 The text which follows tells of seven years of low Niles and famine. In its present form the text derives from the Ptolemaic period (perhaps around the end of the 2nd century B.C.). However, its stated setting is the reign of Djoser of the Third Dynasty (about 28th century B.C.). It states the reasons why a stretch of Nile land south of Elephantine had been devoted to Khnum, god of Elephantine. It is a question whether it is a priesdy forgery of some late period, justifying their claim to territorial privileges, or whether it correcdy recounts an actual grant of land more than 2,500 years earlier. This question cannot be answered in final terms.2 We can only affirm that Egypt had a tradition of seven lean years, which, by a contractual arrangement between pharaoh and a god, were to be followed by years of plenty.
The inscription is carved on a rock on the island of Siheil near the First Cataract. It was published by H. K. Brugsch, Die biblischen sieben Jahre der Hungersnoth (Leipzig, 1891), and by I.

According to n.17 above, the round trip might take 34 months. The resultant 79 months is within 2 months of the 81 months between the present date and that against n. 11 above.
1 These texts have been gathered in Vandier, opxtt. For example, on his p. 105, he gives a previously unpublished text from the First Intermediate Period (23rd-2ist century B . C . ) , from a tomb some distance south of Thebes. "When the entire Upper Egypt was dying because of hunger, with every man eating his (own) children, I never allowed death to occur from hunger in this nome. I gave a loan of grain to Upper Egypt. . . . Moreover, I kept alive the domain of Elephantine and kept alive Iat-negen in these years, after the towns of Hefat and Hor-mer had been satisfied." He took care of his home districts first. 2 Vandier, opxtt., 40-42, reviews the arguments for dating the writing of the text to Ptolemy X Soter II on the basis of much older documents.

Year 18 of the Horus: Netjer-er-khet; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Netjer-er-khet; the Two Goddesses: Netjer-er-khet; the Horus of Gold: Djoser, and under the Count, Mayor, Royal Acquaintance, and Overseer of Nubians in Elephantine, Madir. There was brought to him3 this royal decree: To let thee know. I was in distress on the Great Throne, and those who are in the palace were in heart's affliction from a very great evil, since the Nile had not come in my time for a space of seven years.4 Grain was scant, fruits were dried up, and everything which they eat was short. Every man robbed his companion. They moved without going {ahead). The infant was wailing; the youth was waiting; the heart of the old men was in sorrow, their legs were bent, crouching on the ground, their arms were folded. The courtiers were in need. The temples were shut up; the sanctuaries held [nothing but] air. Every [thing] was found empty.5 I extended my heart back to the beginnings, and I asked him who was the Chamberlain, the Ibis, the Chief Lector Priest Ii-em-(ho)tep,8 the son of Ptah, South-of-His-Wall: "What is the birthplace of the Nile? Who is... the god there ? Who is the god ?" Then he answered (5) me: "I need the guidance of Him Who Presides over the House of the Fowling Net,1 . . . for the hearts confidence of all men about what they should do. I shall enter into the House of Life and spread out the Souls of Re,8 (to see) if some guidance be in them." So he went, and he returned to me immediately, that he might instruct me on the inundation of the N i l e , . . . and everything about which they had written. He uncovered for me the hidden spells thereof, to which the ancestors had taken (their) way, without their equal among kings since the limits of time. He said to me: "There is a city in the midst of the waters [from which] the Nile rises, named Elephantine. It is the Beginning of the Beginning, the Beginning Nome, (facing) toward WawaL® It is the joining of the land, the primeval hillock10 of earth, the throne of Re, when he reckons to cast life beside everybody. 'Pleasant of Life' is the name of its dwelling. "The T w o Caverns' is the name of the water; they are the two breasts which pour
8 To Madir, the Governor at Elephantine. 4 Or: "in a pause of seven years." 8 "Found empty" may be used of the desolation of buildings. However, it is particularly common as a scribal notation to mark a lacuna in an older text. Its appearance here might be raised as an argument that our inscription derived from an earlier and damaged original. 8Ii-em-hotep was the famed minister of Djoser, whose reputation for wisdom (cf. pp. 432, n.4; 467, n.4 below) later brought him deification. On his career, see K. Sethe, Imhotep, der Asklepios der Aegypter (Untersuch, n, Leipzig, 1902), 95-118. 7 Thoth of Hermopolis, the god of wisdom and of priesdy lore. 8 For this passage see A. H. Gardiner in JEA, xxiv (1938), 166. The House of Life was the scriptorium in which the sacred and magic books were kept. "The Souls of Re," or emanations from the creator-god, were the books themselves. 9 As the southernmost of Egyptian administrative districts, Elephantine was the "Nome of the Beginning." Wawat was that part of Nubia immediately south of the First Cataract. 10 In a context which has many uncertainties, it is certain that Elephantine is likened to the mound on which creation took place; see p. 4, n.7.

He fecundates (the land) by mounting as the male, the bull, to the female; he renews (his) virility, assuaging his desire. He rushes twenty-eight cubits (high at Elephantine); he hastens at Diospolis seven cubits (high).12 Khnum is there as a god " .. (18) . . . As I slept in life and satisfaction, I discovered the god standing over against me.14 I propitiated him with praise; I prayed to him in his presence. He revealed himself to me, his face being fresh. His words were: "I am Khnum, thy f a s h i o n e r . . . I know the Nile. When he is introduced into the fields, his introduction gives life to every nostril, like the introduction (of life) to the fields... The Nile will pour forth for thee, without a year of cessation or laxness for any land. Plants will grow, bowing down under the fruit. Renenut18 will be at the head of everything Dependents will fulfill the purposes in their hearts, (22) as well as the master. The starvation year will have gone, and (people's) borrowing from their granaries will have departed. Egypt will come into the fields, the banks will sparkle, . . . and contentment will be in their hearts more than that which was formerly." Then I awoke quickly, my heart cutting off weariness. I made this decree beside my father K h n u m : " "An offering which the King gives to Khnum, the Lord of the Cataract Region, Who Presides over Nubia, in recompense for these things which thou wilt do for me: "I offer to thee thy west in Manu and thy east (in) Bakhu,18 from Elephantine as far as [Takompso], for twelve iters19 on the east and west, whether arable land or desert or river in every part of these iters..." (The remainder of the text continues Djoser's promise to Khnum, the essence of which is that the land presented to the god shall be tithed for his temple. It is finally provided that the decree shall be inscribed on a stela in the temple of Khnum.)
11 In Egyptian mythology the Nile emerged from two underground caverns at Elephantine. 12 Sema-behdet-Diospolis Inferior has been located by A. H. Gardiner at Tell el-Balamun in the northern Delta: JEA, xxx (1944). 33-41. In context with Elephantine, it was the "Dan to Beersheba" of the Egyptians. It is not easy to interpret the measurements given here, since we do not know what zero datum was used. The Nile was 28 cubits high (about 14.5 m. or 48 ft.) at Elephantine, and 7 cubits (about 3.75 m, or 12 ft.) at Diospolis. Baedeker's Aegypten und der Sudan (8th ed., Leipzig, 1928), Ixviii, gives the mean average difference between low and high Nile at Assuan as 7 m. (23 ft.) and at Cairo as 4.9 m. (16 ft.). 13 Ii-em-hotep's report goes on to recite the divine powers of the god Khnum and of the other deities of Elephantine, as well as the mineral wealth of the region. Having received the report, the pharaoh performed services for the gods of Elephantine. 14 Khnum appeared to the pharaoh in a dream. 15 This translation omits Khnum's recital of his powers. 18 The goddess of the harvest. 17 That is, in the temple of Khnum. 18 Manu was the western and Bakhu the eastern mountain range bordering the Nile. 19 T h e stretch of 12 iters from Elephantine south to a place called Takompso constituted the Dode\aschoinos known from the Greek writers. Unfortunately, the location of Takompso and the length of the iter at the time in question are unknown. See Sethe, op.cit., 59 ff.
Mortuary Texts: Life after Death
THE CONQUEST OF DEATH
These two extracts from the Pyramid Texts insist upon the immortality of the pharaoh. The device used is to identify him with the gods, whose death would not come into question, particularly with Osiris and his son Horus. These two texts are carved inside the pyramids of Unis of the Fifth Dynasty and Pepi II of the Sixth Dynasty (25th and 24th centuries B.C.). Originally used for the pharaoh only, the texts were extended to queens by the end of the Sixth Dynasty and to worthy nonroyal persons by the Eleventh-Twelfth Dynasties (21st century B.C. and after). The pyramids of Unis and Pepi II are at Sakkarah. The material used in these two utterances is demonstrably much older than the Fifth Dynasty, as indicated by the archaic linguistic usages and—less certainly—by mythological references. The texts are published in K. Sethe, Die altagyptischen Pyramidentexte, 1 (Leipzig, 1908), and Uebersetzung und Kommentar zu den altagyptischen Pyramidentexten, 1, (Gliickstadt und Hamburg, undated). Extract a, which is Pyramid Utterance 213, will be found as §134-35; extract b, from Utterance 219, as §167-93.

Thus the deceased shares the immortality of Osiris. 8 In successive stanzas, the deceased is then introduced as Osiris to Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Isis, Seth, Nephthys, Thoth, Horus, the Great Ennead, the Litde Ennead, and Naunet(?). The language is almost the same in every case, except for such variants as relationship would require. For example, it would be absurd to state that Seth, who had murdered Osiris, had caused him to live on. In that case the address therefore runs: "O Seth, the one here is that brother of thine, Osiris, who has been caused to survive and to live on, that he might punish thee." Following the addresses to the several gods, the text proceeds to enunciate the immortality of Osiris in each of several cult-centers.

THE FIELDS OF PARADISE
As the sun went to rest every night and was gloriously reborn every morning, so also a mortal left this world but was reborn for eternal happiness in the other world. The eastern horizon of heaven was thus an analogue for entry into paradise. The following text gives a few of the wonders of that home of the blessed. The spell first occurs in the coffins of the Middle Kingdom. The hieroglyphic text is given by A. de Buck, The Egyptian Coffin Texts, H (O/P XLIX, Chicago, 1938), Spell 159, pp. 363 ff. It later became the 109th chapter of the Book of the Dead and is studied by K. Sethe et al. in ZAeS, LIX (1924), 1 ff. (cf. also the 107th and 149th chapters and the vignette to the 110th chapter).·

7 These sentences show that this Utterance was used as an offering text to maintain the deceased. When a survivor made offering to the dead, he played the part of Horus offering his eye to his father Osiris. 8 Again there is identification of the dead pharaoh with Osiris.

2 The 17th chapter of the Book of the Dead (H. Grapow, Religiose Ur^unden [Url(., v], 28) mentions this door, with explanatory glosses: "I reach the land of the horizon-dwellers; I go forth from the august door. What is it? It is the Field of Reeds, which brings forth provisions for the gods who are about the shrine (of the sun-god). Further, as for that 'august door,' it is the door of the liftings of (die air-god) Shu. Another version: it is the door of the Underworld. Another version: it is the leaves of the door through which my father Atum proceeds, when he proceeds to the eastern horizon of heaven." 8 The door has pleasant waters, where birds delight to be. On the Nile, movement south or upstream uses the prevailing north wind and a raised sail, movement north or downstream uses the current and the aid of oars. So also, in paradise the waters must be the same as in this world. 4 Whether the movement is with the breeze or by rowing, the deceased has a useful function in the sun barque. 8 As the air-god, Shu was responsible for lifting heaven from earth;
cf. n.2 above. Here he planted trees as supports. 8 The Elysian Fields of the Egyptians included a se\het iaru "Field of Reeds" and a se\het hetep "Field of Offerings." See n.io below.

THE GOOD FORTUNE OF THE DEAD
The Egyptians looked upon death as a continuation of this life and a fulfillment of the good things of this life. The following text sets forth the quietude which is the happy lot of the dead. Carved on the wall of the tomb of Nefer-hotep at Thebes (Tomb No. 50) and dated to the reign of Hor-em-heb (about 1349-1319 B.C.). From the same tomb comes the Song of the Harper (p. 467 below). Published by A. H. Gardiner in PSBA, xxxv (1913), 165-70, and by M. Lichtheim, with translation and bibliography, in JNES, iv (1945), 197-98, 212. The setting and significance of the text are discussed by Gardiner, The Attitude of the Ancient Egyptians to Death and the Dead (Cambridge, 1935), 32.
The Singer with the Harp of the God's Father of Amon, Nefer-hotep, the triumphant, said:
A l l ye excellent nobles, the Ennead of the Mistress of Life,1 Hear ye how praises are made to the God's Father, With homage paid to the excellent noble's efficacious soul, Now that he is a god living forever, Magnified in the West. May they become a remembrance for the future, For all who come to pass by.
I have heard those songs which are in the ancient tombs And what they tell in magnifying (life) on earth And in belittling the necropolis. Why is it that such is done to the land of eternity, The right and true, without terrors ? Quarreling is its abomination, And there is no one who arrays himself against his fellow. This land which has no opponent
7 Almost 7 feet tall, of which the ear was about 20 inches long. 8 About 12 feet tall, of which the ear was about 41 inches long. 9 Over 15 feet tall. We are not clear about the "horizon-dwellers." Some later texts change them from akjitiu to ak.hu "effective personalities," that is, the blessed dead. 10 The vignette to the 110th chapter of the Book of the Dead shows the fields of paradise. For example, in the Papyrus of Ani (British Museum 10470; E. A. W. Budge, The Book, of the Dead [London 1898], Translation Volume, PI. opp. p. 170), fields surrounded and cut by waterways are shown, with the deceased plowing, reaping, and threshing. Part of this area is labeled as the "Field of Reeds" and as the "place of the effective personalities, whose length is 7 cubits; the barley is of 3 cubits. It is the noble dead who reap it." II Har-akhti, that is, Horus of the (Morning) Horizon, and the Morning Star are obviously in place in the east. We know litde about the \hurercalf, possibly a newborn suckling calf.
1 The song is addressed to the honored dead and the gods of the necropolis.



EGYPTIAN MYTIJS, TALES,
A l l our kinsfolk rest in it since the first day of time. They who are to be, for millions of millions, Will all have come to it. There exists none who may tarry in the land of

There is not one who fails to reach yon place.
As for the duration of what is done on earth, It is a kind of a dream; (But) they say: "Welcome, safe and sound!" To him who reaches the West.
THE PROTESTATION OF GUILTLESSNESS
Among the literary remains from ancient Egypt, a large proportion of the texts seeks to secure eternal happiness for the deceased individual. Under the Empire and later, such mortuary texts were normally on papyrus and have been gathered together by modern scholars under the tide, the "Book of the Dead." A common part of this collection of miscellaneous texts envisages the deceased as testifying before a posthumous court and denying any guilt in various crimes and shortcomings. This so<alled "negative confession" is one of our few sources for Egyptian social law. Its negative protestations must be studied together with the positive attitudes in the wisdom literature (pp. 412-425).
The following translation takes extracts from a portion of the 125th chapter of the Book of the Dead* as gathered by Ch. Maystre, Les declarations £ innocence (Livre des morts, chapitre /25), (Cairo, 1937). Maystre's texts run from the Eighteenth through the Twenty-first Dynasty (1550-950 B . C . ) . 1 Many other texts here translated were employed for mortuary purposes, e.g., pp. 3-4, 10-11, 11-12, etc. For a funerary ritual, see p. 325. For the judgment after death, see p. 415. For attitudes toward death, see pp. 412-414, 467. For a brief description of an Egyptian funeral, see pp. 20-21.
What is said on reaching the Broad-Hall of the T w o Justices,* absolving Xs of every sin which he has committed, and seeing the faces of the gods: Hail to thee, O great god, lord of the T w o Justices!4 I have come to thee, my lord, I have been brought that I might see thy beauty. I know thee; I know thy name and the names of the forty-two gods who are with thee in the Broad-Hall of the T w o Justices,8 who live on them who preserve evil and who drink their blood on that day of reckoning up character in the presence of Wennofer.8 Behold, "Sati-mertifi, Lord of Justice," is thy name/1 have come to thee; I have brought thee justice; I have expelled deceit for thee. ( A i ) I have not committed evil against men. (A2) I have not mistreated cattle.
1 The numbering of the A and B series of protestations is that of Maystre. The concluding statement, following the B series, is taken from the 18th dynasty Papyrus of Nu, as given in E. A. W. Budge, The Book of Dead (London, 1898), Text Vol., 259 ff. 2 The place of the next-world judgment. The meaning of the dual is obscure, although it is clearly a part of that balanced dualism which was so dear to the ancient Egyptian. 8 The name and tide of the deceased. 4 Osiris, the judge of the dead. 8 The knowledge of a name was an important force for control or influence, cf. pp. 12-14. Why the divine jurors were 42 in number we do not know. 8 Wen-nofer is Osiris. The 42 jurors are also avengers of guilt. T Sati-mertifi means "the T w o Daughters, His T w o Eyes," but its application to Osiris is inexplicable.

Sumerian Myths and Epic Tales
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Enki and Ninhursag:
a Paradise Myth
"Enki and Ninhursag" is one of the best preserved of the Sumerian myths uncovered to date. The story it tells is well nigh complete and at least on the surface most of the details of its rather complicated plot are reasonably intelligible. Unfortunately, the main purpose of the myth as a whole is by no means clear and the literary and mythological implications of its numerous and varied motifs are not readily analyzable.1 Nevertheless it adds much that is significant for the Near Eastern mythological horizon, and perhaps even provides a number of interesting parallels to the motifs of the biblical paradise story as told in the second and third chapters of Genesis.2 Briefly sketched, the contents of "Enki and Ninhursag" run as follows: The poem begins with a eulogy of Dilmun,3 described as both a "land" and a "city," where the action of the story takes place. This Dilmun, according to our poem, is a place that is pure, clean, and bright (lines 1-13). It is a land in which there is probably neither sickness nor death (lines 14-30). It is a city which, by the command of the Sumerian water-god Enki, has become full of sweet water and of crop-bearing fields and farms and has thus become known as "the house of the bank-quays of the land" (lines 31-64).
Following a brief passage whose interpretation is far from clear (lines 65-72),* the main action of the myth begins. Enki impregnates the goddess Ninhursag, "the mother of the land," who, after nine days of pregnancy gives birth, without pain and effort, to the goddess Ninmu. Enki then proceeds to impregnate his daughter Ninmu, who in the same way as her mother Ninhursag, gives birth to the goddess named Ninkurra (lines 89108). Enki then impregnates his granddaughter Ninkurra, and the latter gives birth to the goddess Uttu5 (lines 109-127). Enki is now evidendy prepared to impregnate his great-granddaughter Uttu when Ninhursag, the great-grandmother, intervenes and offers the latter some pertinent advice. Unfortunately the relevant passage (lines 128-152) is almost completely destroyed. But to judge from the passage that follows (lines 153-185) Uttu may have been instructed by Ninhursag not to cohabit with Enki until and unless he brings her a gift of cucumbers, apples, and grapes. Be that as it may, we next see Enki obtain the cucumbers,
1 For a discussion of the aims and techniques of the Sumerian mythographers, cf. the writer's review of The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man in JCS, 11, 39 ff. 2 c f . BASOR SS, No. 1, 8-9. s F o r a detailed discussion of Dilmun and its location, cf. the writer's Dilmun, the Land of the Living, BASOR, 96, 18-28; for a contrary opinion, cf. now P. B. Cornwall, BASOR, 103 (1946), 3-11. 4 The suggestion in SS, No. 1, that the passage "may contain a description in anthropomorphic terms of the poet's notion of the formation of the marshlands in the neighborhood of the deltas bordering the Persian G u l f ' (pp. 4-5) is highly dubious and might perhaps better not have been made in the first place. 5 The mythological motifs involved in the birth of the goddesses Ninmu, Ninkurra and Uttu (note, too, that according to a variant of our text, a goddess by the name of Ninsig is to be added as a fourth in this chain of births) are obscure; Ninmu and Ninsig, to judge from their names ("the Lady who brings forth" and "the Lady who makes green"), seem to be deities whose activities originally concerned vegetation; the goddess Ninkurra, "Lady of the mountain-land" or perhaps "Lady of the nether world," is a deity whose activities seem to be restricted to stone working; the goddess Uttu seems to be a deity whose activities had to do with clothing (cf. now Jacobsen, JNES, v, 143).
apples, and grapes from a gardener0 who probably brought them to him in gratitude for his watering the dikes, ditches, and uncultivated places (lines 153-167). Enki brings them to Uttu as a gift, and the latter now joyfully receives his advances and cohabits with him (lines 165-185). But of this union probably no new goddess is born. Instead, Ninhursag seems to utilize Enki's semen in a way which leads to the sprouting of eight different plants: the "tree"-plant, the "honey"-plant, the roadweed-plant, the apasar-plant,7 the Mornplant, the caper-plant, a plant whose name is illegible, and the cassia-plant (lines 186-195). And now Enki commits a sinful deed. As he looked about him in the marshland, he noticed the eight plants and probably determined to decide their fate. But first, it seems, he had to know their heart, that is, he probably had to taste what they were like. And so his messenger, the twofaced god Isimud, plucks each of the eight plants for Enki, and the latter eats them one by one (lines 196-217). Angered by this act, Ninhursag, the goddess who is so largely responsible for their first coming into existence, utters a curse against Enki, saying that until he dies she will not look upon him with the "eye of life." And, as good as her word, she immediately disappears. Whereupon, Enki no doubt begins to pine away, and the Anunnaki, the "great" but nameless Sumerian gods, sit in the dust. At this point the fox8 comes to the rescue; he asks Enlil, the leader of the Sumerian pantheon,9 what would be his reward if he brought Ninhursag back to the gods. Enlil names his reward, and the fox, sure enough, succeeds in some way in having Ninhursag return to the gods in Dilmun (lines 221-249). Ninhursag then seats the dying Enki by her vulva,10 and asks where he feels pain. Enki names an organ of the body which hurts him, and Ninhursag then informs him that she has caused a certain deity to be born for him,11 the implication being that the birth of the deity will result in the healing of the sick member. All in all, Ninhursag repeats the question eight times.12 Each time Enki names an organ of the body which pains him, and in each case Ninhursag announces the birth of a corresponding deity (lines 250-268).13 Finally, probably at the request of Ninhursag, Enki decreed the fate of the newborn deities, the last of whom, Enshag by name, is destined to be "the lord of Dilmun."
The text of "Enki and Ninhursag" is based primarily on a fairly well-preserved six-column tablet excavated in Nippur and
6 The presence of the gardener is not to be taken as an indication that our myth deals in any way with human beings; the gardener is no doubt to be considered as one of a host of minor deities in charge of a particular activity in the service of the gods. 7 The reading of the name of this plant is uncertain. 8 At least in Dilmun, therefore, which may perhaps be characterized as a divine paradise (cf. SS No. 1, 8, note 28), some animals were conceived as existing at the time when the action of our myth is supposed to take place. • Note that Enlil, too, thus seems to be present in Dilmun. 10 Actually the text seems to say "in her vulva." 11 For the difficulties involved in the interpretation of the relevant lines, cf. SS, No. 1, 6, note 22. 12 Note that the number of Enki's sick organs corresponds to the number of plants which he had eaten. 13 The correspondence between the sick member and the healing deity rests on the superficial and punlike etymologizing of the ancient scribes; the Sumerian word for the sick organ contains at least one syllable in common with the name of the deity. Thus e.g. one of the organs that pained Enki was the "mouth," the Sumerian word for which is k,a, and the deity created to alleviate this pain is called Nin^asi; similarly, the goddess born to alleviate the pain of the rib, the Sumerian word for which is ti, is named Nin/i, etc.

now in the University Museum; it was copied and published by Stephen Langdon under the tide Sumerian Epic of Paradise, the Flood, and the Fall of Man in PBS, x, Pt. 1 (1915). Since then a fragment of unknown provenience has been published by Henri De Genouillac in TRS, 62, but the nature of its contents was first recognized by Edward Chiera (cf. JAOS, LIV, 417). Both tablets were actually inscribed some time in the first half of the second millennium B.C.; the date when the myth was first composed is unknown. A transliteration and translation of the poem were published by the writer in BASOR SS No. 1 (1945); here will be found references to earlier literature. A translation of the poem based on the transliteration in SS No. 1 has been published by M. Witzel in Orientalia NS, xv (1946), 239-285. A resume of the contents of the myth and a translation of the first 25 lines were published by T. Jacobsen in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, pp. 157-160 (cf. the present writer's comment in JCS, n, 58, note 40) .14

14 Note also the review of SS No. 1 by Raymond Jestin in Syria, xxv (1946-1948), 150-155. 15 The scribe of the tablet on which the text of the poem is based, often omitted words and contplexes (or parts of words and complexes) that were obvious repetitions; such omissions are given in parentheses throughout this translation. 16 Lines 13-25 seem to fit the assumption that Dilmun is a land in which there is neither sickness nor death; the implications of lines 26-30, however, are obscure even where the renderings are relatively certain. 17 The ittidu-bud is probably a bird whose cry is a mark of death and desolation. 18 Brackets erroneously omitted in SS No. 1. 19 "Its" in this and the next line refers to Dilmun. 20 The word "father" is here used as an honorific tide and does not denote actual paternity.

21 Note that this rendering differs slighdy from that in SS No. 1. 22 Utu (not to be confused with the goddess Uttu) is the sun-god. 28 Nanna is the moon-god. 24 This line must have been accidentally omitted by the scribe, cf. line 61; note too, the slighdy varying rendering of these two lines from that in SS No. 1. 25 Note this new rendering, and cf. Witzel, Orientalia, x v , 268. 26 The Sumerian word here rendered "land" usually refers to Sumer; but since "thy city" refers to Dilmun, the implications of the line are not too clear. 27 The first half of this line corresponds to line 51. 28 Perhaps the rendering of this line and Ac next should read: "Who is alone, the wise, before Nintu, the mother of the land; Enki, the wise, before Nintu, the mother of the land," cf. SS No. 1, 24; for the word "land" cf. note 26.

Dumuzi and Enkimdu: the
Dispute between the Shepherd
God and the Farmer-God
This poem is one of a group of Sumerian compositions whose plot is based on what may not inapdy be described as the "CainAbel" motif; their contents consist in large part of disputes between two gods, two demigods, or two kings,1 each of whom attempts to convince the other of his superiority by extolling his own virtues and achievements and belittling those of his opponent To be sure, in all our extant compositions, the dispute ends in a reconciliation, or at least in a peaceful settlement, rather than in a murder; indeed in the case of the present poem, one of the characters, the farmer-god, is an unusually meek and peaceful person who takes the wind out of his opponent's sails by refusing to quarrel in the first place.2 But the psychological ingredient is the same throughout, an aggressive attitude on the part of one of the characters resulting, at least in some cases, from a feeling of inferiority and frustration. In the case of the present poem, it is Dumuzi, the shepherd-god, who, having been rejected by the goddess Inanna in favor of the farmer-god,8 is impelled to enumerate his superior qualities in elaborate detail, and to pick a quarrel with his peace-loving rival.
The characters of our poem are four in number: the goddess Inanna; her brother, die sun-god Utu; the shepherd-god
55 The translation assumes that this line contains the words of Ninhursag; it is not altogether impossible, however, that it is Enki who is speaking; in this case the line should be rendered "For the litde ones which thou hast caused to be born. . . ." Similarly, the translation assumes that lines 270-277 contain the words of Enki; there is a bare possibility, however, that it is Ninhursag who is speaking. 56 The land Magan is usually identified either with Arabia or with Egypt.
1 cf. for the present the poems "Emesh and Enten" (SM, 49-51), "Catde and Grain" (ibid., 53-54), "Enmerkar and Ensukushsiranna" (PAPS, x c , [1946], 122-123). The motif was extended to include disputes between animals and inanimate objects; cf. the four wisdom compositions mentioned on p. 15 of SM; cf. also Jacob sen in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, 165-166. 2 Note, on the other hand that, in the Cain-Abel story as told in the book of Genesis, it is the former, Cain, who seems to be the more aggressive throughout. 3 In the Cain-Abel story, it is the farmer who feels rejected by his god.
and epic t a l e s 41
Dumuzi; and the farmer-god Enkimdu. Its contents may be summarized as follows: Following a brief introduction, whose contents are largely fragmentary (lines 1-9), we find Utu addressing his sister and urging her to become the wife of the shepherd Dumuzi (lines 10-19). Inanna's answer (lines 20-34? )4 consists of a flat refusal; she is determined instead to marry the farmer Enkimdu. Following several fragmentary lines of uncertain meaning (lines 35?-39), the text continues with a long address of the shepherd, directed probably to Inanna, in which he details his superior qualities (lines 40-64). We then find the shepherd rejoicing on die riverbank, probably because his argument had convinced Inanna and induced her to change her mind.5 There he meets Enkimdu and starts a quarrel with him (lines 65-73). But the latter refuses to quarrel and agrees to allow Dumuzi's flocks to pasture anywhere in his territory (lines 74-79). The latter, thus appeased, invited the farmer to his wedding as one of his friends (lines 80-83). Whereupon, Enkimdu offers to bring him and Inanna several selected farm products as a wedding gift (lines 84-87). The poet then ends the composition with the conventional literary notations.
The text of the poem is reconstructed from three tablets and fragments excavated in Nippur; they date from the first half of the second millennium B.C. A transliteration and translation of the poem prepared recendy by the writer will be found in JCS, 11 (1948), pp. 60-68. A preliminary sketch of the plot of the poem under the tide Inanna Prefers the Farmer, together with translations of several excerpts from the poem was published by the writer in SM, (1944), 101-103. An interpretation of the contents of the poem under the tide, The Wooing of Inanna: Relative Merits of Shepherd and Farmer, was published by Thorkild Jacobsen in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man (1946), 166-168.

4 The reader will do well to note that there is no introductory statement to indicate who addresses whom in any of the speeches in our poem except in case of the first, that is, in the case of Utu's address to Inanna; in all other instances it is only from the context that we can gather who the speaker is. Helpful to the translator, however, is the Sumerian dialect in which the speech is reproduced; when it is in the Emesal dialect, the speaker must be Inanna. s It must be stressed, however, that this is only an inference from the context, it is not expressly stated anywhere in the text.

The Deluge
This Sumerian myth concerning the flood, with its Sumerian counterpart of the antediluvian Noah, offers the closest and most striking parallel to biblical material as yet uncovered in Sumerian literature. Moreover, its introductory passages are of considerable significance for Mesopotamian cosmogony; they include a number of important statements concerning the creation of man, the origin of kingship, and the existence of at least five antediluvian cities. Unfortunately, only one tablet inscribed with the myth has been uncovered to date, and of that tablet only the lower third is preserved. As a result, much of the context of the story is obscure, and but a few of the passages can be rendered with any degree of certainty. Briefly sketched, the contents run as follows: Following a break of about 37 lines, we find a deity1 addressing other deities and probably stating that he will save mankind from destruction.2 As a result, the deity continues, man will build the cities and temples of the gods. Following the address are three lines which are difficult to relate to the context; they seem to describe the actions performed by the deity to make his words effective. These lines are in turn followed by four lines concerned with the creation of man, animals, and, perhaps, plants. Here another break of about 37 lines follows, after which we learn that kingship was lowered from heaven, and that five cities were founded. A break of about 37 lines now follows; these must have dealt largely with the decision of the gods to bring the flood and destroy mankind. When the text becomes intelligible again we find some of the gods dissatisfied and unhappy over the cruel decision. We are then introduced to Ziusudra, the counterpart of the biblical Noah, who is described as a pious, a god-fearing king,* constandy on the lookout for divine revelations in dreams or incantations. Ziusudra seems to station himself by a wall, where he hears the voice of a deity4 informing him of the decision taken by the assembly of the gods to send a flood and "to destroy the seed of mankind." The text
7 To judge from the other compositions of this literary genre, one might have expected here a line reading approximately "The shepherd having proved the victor over the fanner." 8 Balbale is the technical name for a category of Sumerian compositions which, to judge from the extant material, are hymnal in character; the actual meaning of the complex is still uncertain.
1 There is some possibility that it is more than one deity who is speaking; die relevant Sumerian verbal forms in this passage seem to be inconsistent in regard to the use of the singular and plural. The name of the speaker (or speakers) is destroyed; probably it is either Enki or Anu and Enlil (perhaps better Anu Enlil; cf. n.7). 2 The nature of this destruction is not known; it is rather unlikely that it refers to the deluge. 8 The text does not give the name of the state over which he ruled, but we know from the Sumerian king list that he is supposed to have ruled over Sumer from his capital city Shuruppak; cf. AS 11, p. 26, n.34. 4 Probably EnVi; the name of the deity is not given in the text.

must have continued with detailed instructions to Ziusudra to build a giant boat and thus save himself from destruction.8 But, all this is missing since there is another break of about 40 lines at this point When the text becomes intelligible once again, we find that the flood in all its violence had already come upon the "land,"6 and raged there for seven days and nights. But then the sun-god Utu came forth again, bringing his precious light everywhere, and Ziusudra prostrates himself before him and offers sacrifices. Here again there follows a break of about 39 lines. The last extant lines of our text describe the deification of Ziusudra. After he had prostrated himself before Anu and Enlil,7 he was given "life like a god" and breath eternal, and translated to Dilmun,8 "the place where the sun rises." The remainder of the poem, about 39 lines of- text, is destroyed."
The "deluge" tablet, or rather the lower third of it which is extant, was excavated in Nippur, and is now in the University Museum. It was published by Arno Poebel in PBS, v (1914), No. 1; a transliteration and translation of the text, together with a detailed commentary, were published by the same author in PBS, iv, Pt. 1, pp. 9-70. Poebel's translation is still standard, and except for slight modifications, underlies the present translation.10

5 Whom else and what else he took with him in the boat are not found in the extant text, but note that, to judge from line 2 1 1 , he had certainly taken along a number of animals. 6 The Sumerian word here rendered as "land" usually se*ms to refer to Sumer. 7 Perhaps a rendering "Anu Enlil" for " A n u and Enlil" is preferable; that is, the Enlil to whom the powers of Anu were delegated when the former took Anu's place as the leading deity of the Sumerian pantheon; cf. for the problem involved, Poebel, PBS, JV, Pt. 2, pp. 36 ff. 8 For the location of Dilmun, cf. now p. 37 of this work. 9 That is, if we assume that the last column was fully inscribed. Note, too, that there is the possibility that this tablet contained only part of the myth and that the latter may have been continued on another tablet or even other tablets, though on the whole this does not seem too likely. As for the so-called colophon to this tablet (cf. PBS, iv, Pt. 2, p. 63), cf. n.57.
10 cf. also King, Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (1918); Jacobsen, AS 11, pp. 58-59; Heidel, The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels (1946); Kramer, SM, 97-98. The numbering of the lines in the present translation is based on the assumption that each column of the tablet originally contained approximately 50 lines of text. 11 Our interpretation of the text assumes that the speaking deity (or deities) plans to save mankind from destruction, but this is of course by no means certain. 12 Nintu is the Sumerian mother goddess known also under the names Ninhursag and Ninmah; cf. n.32 on p. 39 of this work. She is not to be confused with the goddess Inanna, the Semitic Ishtar, a goddess noted primarily for love and war; cf. Poebel, PBS, iv, Pt. 2, pp. 24 ff. 13 The verbal form in this line seems to be {Jural in form; if so, the rendering should be " w e " rather than " I . " 14 Actually the Sumerian seems to say "from" rather than "to"; indeed the meaning of the entire line is highly doubtful. 15 That is "the people" mentioned in the preceding line. 16 The implications of this phrase, even if the translation should prove correct, are obscure; note particularly that the Sumerian word rendered by "(divine) ordinances" is the same as that rendered "our" in the following two lines. 17 Perhaps " w e " instead of "1"; the verbal form in this case seems to be incorrect, since it corresponds neither to the singular nor the plural form of the verb. 18 Perhaps '1 will be soothed by their shade." 19 Perhaps "of the houses of the (divine) ordinances," cf. n.16.

20 That is probably the same deity or deities whose address has just come to an end; cf. n.i. 21 The Sumerian verbal form in this and the next line contains an infix which should be rendered "in (or upon) it (or him, them)," but at present it is difficult to see what this infix relates to. 22 Note that the translation of this line was accidentally omitted in PBS, iv, Pt. 2, p. 17. 23 The word "black-headed" usually refers to the inhabitants of Sumer and Babylon; in the present context, however, it seems to refer to mankind as a whole. For Sumerian concepts concerning the creation of man, cf. SM, 68 ff., and Jacobsen, fNES, v (1946), pp. 134 ff. 24 "From the earth" seems to be repeated in the Sumerian text. 25 Jacobsen, in AS 11, p. 58, restores men at the beginning of the line; there is, however, room for more than one sign in the break. 26 In favor of this restoration, cf. PBS, v, No. 25, rev. v, line 4. 27Identity of deity or deities uncertain; perhaps it is Anu Enlil, cf. n.i. 28 The translation in PBS, iv, Pt 2, p. 18, seems to take care of only part of the break in this and the following line. 29 Our translation does not treat the verbal forms in this line as relatives in spite of their form. 80 cf. now Jacobsen, AS 11, p. 59, n.i 1 1 . 81 The word rendered tentatively as "first" in this line is represented by a sign whose reading cannot as yet be identified. 82 Nudimmud is another name for the water-god Enki. 88 To judge from the surrounding lines one would expect here the name of the tutelary deity of Badtibira, that is Latarak (cf. p. 57 of this work). However, the relevant Sumerian complex is not preceded by the "god" determinative, and seems on the surface to mean "the tabooed garment." 84 Nothing is known of this deity; for the reading of the first part of the name as Hendur- rather than Pa-, cf. K. Tallquist, Akkadische Gotterepitheta (1938), p. 435; Poebel, ZA, xxxix, 143 ff. 36 That is, the sun-god, well known as the tutelary deity of both Sippar and Larsa. 36 The tutelary goddess of Shuruppak identified by the later Babylonian theologians with the goddess Ninlil, the wife of Enlil. 87 The rest of the line is unintelligible, although practically all the Sumerian signs are legible; it may deal with rain and water supply.

38 The punctuation for this and the following line is uncertain. 89 The beginning of the line is to be restored to read hur-gim bi-in-ag. 40 That is "the earth's" or "the land's." 41 That is "conjured by Anu (and) Enlil." 42 Or perhaps better Anu Enlil; cf. n.i. 48 A priesdy title. 44 For the rendering instead of "dreams which had not been (before)" (cf. PBS, iv, Pt. 2, p. 18), see Poebel, Grundziige der sumerischen Grammatt'k (Rostock, 1923), $264. 45 That is "to conjure by." 46 It is difficult to relate this sentence to the context. 47 The name of the speaking deity is not given in the text, but he is, no doubt, Enki; cf.

Gilgamesh and Agga
The Sumerian poem, "Gilgamesh and Agga," is one of the shortest of all Sumerian epic tales; it consists of no more than 115 lines of text. In spite of its brevity, however, it is of unusual significance from several points of view. In the first place, its plot deals with humans only; unlike the rest of the Sumerian epic tales, it introduces no mythological motifs involving any of the Sumerian deities. Secondly it is of considerable historical importance; it provides a number of hitherto unknown facts concerning the early struggles of the Sumerian city states. Finally, it is of very special significance for the history of political thought and practice. For as Thorkild lacobsen was die first to point out,1 it records what are, by all odds, the oldest two political assemblies
56 Lines 251-253, although fully preserved, are at present extremely difficult to render, and the present translation is to be considered as highly doubtful. For not only is the relation of the passage to the context quite obscure, but it contains a number of grammatical difficulties which cannot be explained unless scribal errors are postulated. Thus, to list only some of the contextual problems, the identity of the individual whose speech probably ends with line 251, is uncertain (note that our translation assumes that he is addressing Anu (and Enlil); the antecedent of "it" in lines 251 and 252 (perhaps "he" or "she") is unknown; the Sumerian word rendered by the English word "stretch" in these two lines may have a different meaning here; the relation of the contents of line 253 to the preceding two lines is quite uncertain. As for the grammatical problems, note that the verbal form in line 251 might have been expected to read "utter ye" instead of "ye will utter"; the Sumerian words and complexes rendered as "your" in line 251, "uttered" and "by their" in line 252, are grammatically unjustified unless scribal errors are assumed; line 253, whose rendering is quite literal, seems clumsy and partially redundant. 57 This line is actually written not below the preceding line but on the left edge; it was therefore assumed to be a colophon in PBS, rv, Pt. 2, p. 63 (cf. also Heidel, loc. cit., p. 105). In all likelihood, however, it is a line that was accidentally omitted by the scribe in its proper place, and was therefore inserted on the left edge, where its correct position on the reverse of the tablet was indicated by means of a short horizontal line. The line is poorly preserved; the restoration assumed by our translation is by no means certain. 58 If the rendering is correct, "name" might perhaps connote here "existence." 59 The Sumerian word twice rendered by "land" in this line may also be translated as "mountain" or "mountain-land." 60 Perhaps the crossing of the sun immediately upon his rising in the east; the Sumerian word used may also mean "of rule." 61 That is, probably Anu and Enlil.

as yet known to man. To be sure, the tablets on which the poem has been found inscribed date back no earlier than the first half of the second millennium B.C.; however, the events recorded in them go back to the days of Gilgamesh and Agga, that is probably to the first quarter of the third millennium B.C 2 The contents of the poem may be summarized as follows:8 Agga, the king of Kish has sent envoys to Gilgamesh in Erech (lines 1-2); the purpose of the mission is not stated, but the context makes it obvious that they brought an ultimatum demanding of the Erechites to submit to Kish or take the consequences. Gilgamesh seeks the advice of the assembly of elders and urges them, for reasons that are far from clear, to fight rather than submit (lines 3-8). But the elders are contraryminded; they would rather submit to Kish than fight it out (lines 9-14). Gilgamesh, displeased with this answer, now turns to the assembly of "men," that is, of arms-bearing males, and repeats his plea for war with Kish rather than submission to its rule (lines 15-23). In a long statement ending with a eulogy of Gilgamesh and highly encouraging words of victory, the assembly of "men" declares for war and independence (lines 24-39). Gilgamesh is now well pleased; in a speech to Enkidu, in which he seems to urge him to take to arms, he shows himself highly confident of victory over Agga (lines 40-47). In a very short time, however, Agga besieges Erech, and in spite of their brave words, the Erechites are dumbfounded (lines 48-50). Gilgamesh then addresses the "heroes" of Erech and asks for a volunteer to go before Agga (lines 51-54). A hero by the name of Birhurturri readily volunteers; he is confident that he can confound Agga's judgment (lines 55-58). No sooner does Birhurturri pass through the city gates, however, than he is seized, beaten, and brought before Agga. He begins to speak to Agga, but before he has finished, another hero from Erech, one Zabar . . . ga by name, ascends the wall (lines 59-67). There now follows a series of passages which are of utmost importance for the understanding of the plot of the tale, but which, for reasons oudined in notes 19, 20, and 22 are difficult 2nd obscure. Certain it is, however, that in some way Agga has been induced to take a more friendly attitude and probably to lift the siege (lines 68-99). We then come to a passage whose meaning is quite certain; it consists of an address by Gilgamesh to Agga thanking him for all his kindness (lines 100-106). The poem concludes with a paean of praise to Gilgamesh (lines 107end).
The text of "Gilgamesh and Agga" is reconstructed from eleven tablets and fragments; ten were excavated in Nippur, while the eleventh is of unknown provenience. All the pieces date from the first half of the second millennium B.C.; the date of the actual composition of the poem, however, is still unknown.
2 c f . the writer's N e w Light on the Early History erf the Ancient Near East, AJA, LII (1948), 156-64. 3 It is well to note at this point that our poem provides an excellent example of one of the major difficulties confronting the translator of the Sumerian unilingual material. Here is a composition whose text is in practically perfect condition; there is hardly a single word broken or missing. Moreover, the reading of almost all the signs is certain; so, too, the meaning of most of the individual words. In spite of these favorable conditions, the translation of several crucial passages remains uncertain and obscure; cf. particularly lines 5-7, a passage repeated in lines 11-13 and lines 20-22; lines 75-80 and the corresponding passage in lines 94-99. T h e major difficulty with these passages consists of their laconic style; the aphoristic, riddlelike character of their contents, obscures, at least for the present, their real meaning. As for the historical background behind our poem, the reader should bear in mind that the Sumerian historians divided the history of their land into two major periods, the period before the flood and the one after the flood. T h e first dynasty immediately after the flood, according to these ancient historians, was that of the city of Kish; its last king was the Agga of our poem. The Dynasty of Kish was followed by the Dynasty of Eanna, or Erech (Erech is used more or less as a synonym of Eanna); the Gilgamesh of our poem is the fifth ruler of this dynasty. However, since Gilgamesh was preceded by four rulers of the Dynasty of Erech, who between them reigned over a considerable span of time, it is obvious that the dynasties of Kish and Erech must have overlapped to a large extent.

A transliteration and translation of the poem based on the four of the six texts then known was published by M. Witzel, Orientalia NS, v (1936), 331-346. An excellent translation of most of the first forty-one lines of the poem was published by Jacobsen, JNES, n (1943), 165-166. A brief resume of the contents of the poem was published by the writer in J AOS, LXIV (1944), 17-18. The writer's scientific edition of the poem (with commentary by Jacobsen) appeared in AJA, Lin, 1 fit.

4 Lines 5-7, and the identical lines 11-13 and 20-22, contain a proverblike or riddlelike passage whose meaning in the context is altogether obscure; the renderings given are those usually attributed to the individual words, but they may prove unjustified. Similarly, the grammatical relationships between the various complexes are by no means certain. To judge from the contents of line 8, one might be led to conclude that the passage contained in lines 5-7 gives Gilgamesh's reasons for his plea to fight rather than submit to Kish. It will be noted, however, that in the passage immediately following, the very same words are used by the assembly of elders to justify their decision to submit to Kish rather than go to war. In short we may have here an early example of what is now generally described as "double-talk."

T N e x t to the heaven-god Anu, the goddess Inanna, more commonly known by her Semitic name Ishtar, was the most important deity of Erech. 8 For lines 20-22, cf. comment to lines 5-7. In line 23, note that while the second verb is the expected first person plural, the first verb is the second person plural; it is difficult to see the reason for the change. 9 Lines 24-27, if the rendering is correct, seem to describe the aristocrats ruling Erech; just what the relationship between these individuals and the two assemblies may have been, however, remains uncertain.

Then—Gilgamesh, the lord of Kullab— (40) At the word of the men of his city his heart rejoiced, his spirit brightened; He says to his servant Enkidu: "Therefore let the /«^«"-implement be put aside for the violence of battle,
Let the weapons of batde return to your side, Let them produce fear (and) terror. As for him,15 when he comes, verily my great fear will fall upon him, Verily his judgment will be confounded, verily his counsel will be dissipated." The days were not five, the days were not ten,16 Agga, the son of Enmebaraggesi besieged?1 Erech; Erech—its judgment was confounded.

He had not finished his word (when) Zabar . . . ga ascends toward the wall; He peered over the wall, He saw Agga.
10 "its" presumably refers to Erech. 11 Eanna was the main temple of Erech; literally it is "the House of Anu." " "His" presumably refers to Agga. 18 "Its" presumably refers to Kish. 14 T h e lu\ara is probably an agricultural implement. 15 " H i m " presumably refers to Agga. 16 A Sumerian idiomatic expression for a very brief passage of time. 17 The Sumerian -verb for "besieged," is a third person plural; perhaps therefore the poet intended to include Agga's army as well. 18 "They" presumably refers to Agga's men.

Birhurturri says to him:19
"O servant of the stout man, thy king
The stout man—is he not also my king ? (70)
Verily the stout man is my king,

Verily it is h i s . . . face,

The multitude did not cast itself down, the multitude did not rise,20 The multitude did not cover itself with dust,

19 Lines 68-75 presumably contain the words uttered by Birhurturri in the hope of soothing Agga and inducing him to call off his men and lift die siege; their meaning is however uncertain and obscure. The major difficulty results from the ambiguity of the "him" of line 68. If we assume that it refers to Agga, then Birhurturri seems to say to him that an individual described as a "stout man" is not only Agga's king but also his, that is, Birhurturri's. Presumably this "stout man" would be Gilgamesh, since the latter is not only Birhurturri's overlord, but also, as lines 102-103 seem to indicate, that of Agga as well. But just how was this statement expected to pacify Agga? Indeed, if Agga recognized Gilgamesh as his king, why did he proceed against Erech in the first place? Moreover, what is the purpose of Zabar . . . ga's presence on the wall? Perhaps, therefore, we must assume that die " h i m " of line 68 refers to Zabar . .. ga, and that the "stout man" refers to A g g a , not to Gilgamesh; that is, Birhurturri while standing before Agga cries out to Zabar . . . ga who is looking down on the scene from the wall, that Agga is the acknowledged king of both. 20 The highly doubtful rendering of lines 76-81 assumes that Birhurturri's words had failed to satisfy Agga and his men, and that as a result the siege continued. The "multitude" of lines 76-77, the "people of all the foreign lands" of line 78, the "people of all die lands" of line 79, if the translations are correct, all refer to Agga's modey host besieging Erech; the acts attributed to them in these lines are descriptive of their complete indifference to Birhurturri's words. Line 80 may indicate that the siege was conducted by sea as well as by land; just what the cutting down of the prow erf the magurru-boat signified, however, is not clear. 21 According to lines 82-90, Gilgamesh, seeing that Birhurturri's words had no effect on Agga and his men, in spite of Zabar . . . ga's presence on the wall, himself ascends the wall. At this act, the young and old of Erech are terrified, presumably because of the danger threatening Gilgamesh; the men of Erech now hold their weapons in readiness while Enkidu goes out to the city gate, perhaps to take charge of the Erechites in the expected battle. 22 Lines 91-92 probably represent a much abbreviated form of the passage contained in lines 69-75; note, too, that the crucial line corresponding to line 68, that is "Birhurturri says to him," is omitted. As in the case of the former and fuller passage, the interpretation of lines 91-92 hinges on the ambiguous "him" whom Birhurturri is addressing. If this "him" refers to Agga, then the "stout man" of lines 91-92 is Gilgamesh; if, on the other hand, it refers to Gilgamesh, then the "stout man" is A g g a ; cf. the comment to lines 69-75. In any case, this time Birhurturri's words seem to have

Gilgamesh and the Land
of the Living
The poem "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living" is one of the Sumerian epic tales probably utilized by the Semitic authors in their redaction of the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh.1 Unfortunately, to date only 175 lines of the poem have been re
the desired effect. For according to lines 94-99, which are an exact repetition of lines 76-81 except that the verbs are all positive instead of negative in form, the multitudinous host from many lands which was besieging Erech was now prostrate and overwhelmed, and presumably no longer threatened Erech.
28 In lines 100-106 Gilgamesh thanks Agga for some extraordinary kindness, presumably for the lifting of the siege; unless there has been a shift of scene unmentioned in the text, Gilgamesh is addressing Agga from the wall of Erech. Note, too, that according to lines 103-105, unless we are prepared to read in implications contrary to the obvious meaning of the words, Gilgamesh addresses Agga as his, that is Agga's, superior and overlord in spite of the fact that Agga seems to be the more powerful of the two; cf. comment to lines 68-75. In line 104, "the fleeing bird," and in line 106, "the fleeing man" refer no doubt to Gilgamesh. 24 Lines 107-end are assumed to contain the poet's concluding eulogy of Gilgamesh. With lines 1 0 7 - m , cf. lines 30-36, which are almost identical. The implications of lines 112-113 are not clear. On the surface they seem to say that Agga has restored Gilgamesh to his former greatness, which again tends to indicate that at one time Gilgamesh was the ruler of the entire land, including Kish; cf. comment to lines 100-106 and lines 68-75. As for the phrase "before Utu" in line 1 1 3 , it may refer to the sun-god Utu as the god of justice; it is worth noting, however, that two predecessors of Gilgamesh in the first Erech dynasty are described in the Sumerian texts as "the son of Utu." The last two lines of our poem contain the conventional phrases concluding a myth or epic tale.

and epic tales
covered;2 even so, it is recognizable as a literary creation which must have had a profound emotional and aesthetic appeal to its highly credulous ancient audience. Its motivating theme, man's anxiety about death and its sublimation in the notion of an immortal name, has a universal significance that lends it high poetic value. Its plot structure reveals a careful and imaginative selection of just those details which are essential to its predominandy poignant mood and heroic temper. Stylistically, too, the poet obtains the appropriate rhythmic effect by the skillful use of an uncommonly varied assortment of repetition and parallelism patterns. All in all, there is litde doubt that the poem before us is one of the finest Sumerian literary works as yet uncovered. The contents of the poem may be briefly summarized as follows: The "lord" Gilgamesh, realizing that, like all mortals, he too must die sooner or later, is determined at least to raise up a name for himself before he meets his destined end. He therefore sets his heart on journeying to the far distant Land of the Living* with the probable intention of felling its cedars and bringing them to Erech. He informs his loyal servant and constant companion, Enkidu, of his proposed undertaking, and the latter advises him first to acquaint the sun-god Utu with this plan, for it is Utu who has charge of this cedar land (lines 1-12). Acting upon his advice, Gilgamesh brings offerings to Utu and pleads for his support of the contemplated journey to the Land of the Living (lines 13-18). Utu at first seems rather skeptical about Gilgamesh's qualifications. But Gilgamesh only repeats his plea in more persuasive language (lines 19-33). Utu takes pity on him and decides to help him, probably by immobilizing in some way the seven vicious demons personifying the destructive weather phenomena that might menace Gilgamesh in the course of his journey across the mountains situated between Erech and the Land of the Living (lines 34-45). Overjoyed, Gilgamesh gathers fifty volunteers from Erech, unattached men who have neither "house" nor "mother" and who are ready to follow him in whatever he does (lines 4(5-53). After having weapons of bronze and wood prepared for himself and his companions, they cross the seven mountains with the help of Utu (lines 54-61). Just what happens immediately after the crossing of the last of the seven mountains is not clear, since the relevant passage (lines 62-70) is poorly preserved. When the text becomes intelligible again we find that Gilgamesh had fallen into a heavy sleep from which he is awakened only after considerable time and effort (lines 71-83). Thoroughly aroused by this unexpected delay, he swears by his mother Ninsun and by his father Lugalbanda that he will enter the Land of the Living and brook no interference from either man or god (lines 84-97). Enkidu pleads with him to turn back, for the guardian of the cedars is the fearful monster Huwawa, whose destructive attack none may withstand (lines 95-105). But Gilgamesh will have none of this caution. Convinced that with Enkidu's help no harm can befall either of them, he bids him put away fear and go forward with him (lines 106-119). Spying from his cedar house, however, is the monster Huwawa who seems to make vain, but frantic, efforts to drive off Gilgamesh and his adventurous band (lines 120-126). Following a break of some lines we learn that, after cutting down seven trees, Gilgamesh had probably come to Huwawa's inner chamber (lines 127-141). Strangely enough, at the very first, and seem
2 There is some possibility that the fragmentary extract of a Sumerian poem tentatively entitled "lihc Death of Gilgamesh," might belong to our poem; cf. BASOR, No. 94 ( 1 9 4 4 ) , 2 - 1 2 , and particularly n.4. Note that the line numbering in fCS, 1, 3-46, is off by one, following line 70. 8 For the possibility that Dilmun was the Land of the Living, cf. BASOR, No. 96 (1944), 18-28. Note, however, that to judge from the contents of lines 1 4 6 - 1 5 0 , particularly when compared with the text quoted in JCS, 1 ('947)> 45> note 252 (it reads: Huwawa answers Gilgamesh: "My mother who gave birth to me is the land' (so, instead of 'highland') Hurrum, My father who begot me is the mountain Hurrum, Utu has made me dwell all alone with him in the 'land.'"), it is perhaps the highland Hurrum which is to be taken as the Land of the Living.



5« sumeri an myths
ingly very light, attack on the part of Gilgamesh, Huwawa is overcome with fright; he thereupon utters a prayer to the sungod Utu and adjures Gilgamesh not to kill him (lines 142-151). Gilgamesh would like to act the generous victor, and in riddlelike phrases suggests to Enkidu that Huwawa be set free. But Enkidu, fearful of the consequences, advises against such unwise action (lines 152-161). Following Huwawa's indignant criticism of Enkidu's ungenerous attitude, our two heroes proceed to cut off his neck (lines 162-166). They then seem to bring Huwawa's corpse before Enlil and Ninlil, but what follows is quite uncertain, for after several fragmentary lines our available material comes to an end. The text of "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living" is reconstructed from fourteen tablets and fragments; eleven were excavated in Nippur, one in Kish, while the provenience of two is unknown. All the available tablets and fragments date from the first half of the second millennium B.C. A scientific edition of the poem, including copies of unpublished material in the University Museum, transliteration, translation, and commentary, was published by the writer in JCS, 1 (1947), 3-46; here, too, will be found a copy of a tablet in the Yale Babylonian Collection, copied by Ferris J. Stephens, and a copy of a tablet in the Oriental Museum of the University of Illinois, copied by Albrecht Goetze.

The Death of Gilgamesh
The "Death of Gilgamesh" consists of a text which is but a small part of a poem of unknown length.1 Fragmentary as the text is, its contents are of rather unusual significance for die light they shed on the Sumerian ideas concerning death and the nether world. The text is divided into two sections, A and B, between which there is a break of unknown size.2 The contents of A may be briefly sketched as follows: Following a passage whose meaning is altogether obscure, Gilgamesh is informed that he must cherish no hope for immortality; that Enlil, the father of all the gods, has not destined him for eternal life. He is not to take it to heart, however, for Enlil has granted him kingship, prominence, and heroism in batde. There follows the death of Gilgamesh, described in a passage of typical Sumerian poetic form, consisting of at least ten lines ending with the refrain "lies, rises not," the first part of eight of the lines containing epithets descriptive of Gilgamesh. The section ends with a description of the ensuing mourning.
Section В consists of the last forty-two lines of the poem.8 It begins with a list of Gilgamesh's family and retinue—wives, children, musicians, chief valet, attendants—and continues with the presentation by Gilgamesh of their gifts and offerings to the numerous deities of the nether world. That is, according to at least one plausible interpretation of the available material, Gilgamesh has died and descended to the nether world to become its king.4 Moreover, we must reckon with the possibility that a large palace retinue was buried with Gilgamesh—if so, we have here the first mention of human sacrifices of the type uncovered by
10 Note this important new rendering. 11 A variant and considerably expanded version of our poem is found on a fragmentary tablet from Nippur dating from the same period as the other Nippur tablets and fragments; its contents will be found transliterated and analyzed in the JCS study in notes 205, 206, 217, 222, 226, 241, 245, 250, 252.
1 There is some possibility that the text of our poem is a continuation of the epic tale "Gilgamesh and Huwawa"; cf. pp. 47-50 of the present volume. 2 It is by no means certain, however, that the two sections are part of the same poem. * That this section contains the last lines of whatever poem it is a part of, is certain from its last line which is typical of the end of Sumerian compositions. 4 That Gilgamesh was conceived by the Sumerian theologians and myth makers as king of the nether world is known especially from a text discussed in BASOR, No. 94, 6, n . 1 1 .

Woolley in the tombs of Ur—and that Gilgamesh performs the placation rites essential to their comfortable sojourn in the nether world. The remainder of the poem is poorly preserved; it probably ends with a special tribute to the glory and memory of Gilgamesh. The text of the "Death of Gilgamesh" is reconstructed from three tablets excavated in Nippur, dating from the first half of the second millennium B.C. A translation and transliteration of the available material, together with a copy of one of the tablets, have been published by the writer in BASOR, No. 94 (1944), 2-12.5

5 T h e present translation differs somewhat from that in BASOR; the more significant variations are pointed out in the notes. 6 Because of the fragmentary condition of lines i - i o , the attempted renderings are to be taken as pointers only; the punctuation, too, is of course altogether uncertain. 7 Lines 25-49 form part of an address by some deity or individual whose name was no doubt stated in the lines now destroyed. In lines 25-32, the crucial difficulty involves the subject of the verbal forms; from the extant text it seems impossible to offer an intelligent conjecture. " N o t e the new rendering which omits the translation of the last two complexes of this line; their rendering in BASOR with "verily made (fie!) the thresholds with them" is based on a literal interpretation of the text which may be unjustified. Note, too, the new rendering of line 31. 9 If the rendering is correct, which is not too likely, the line might be taken to indicate the extent of Gilgamesh's power and influence.

10 Note that this line was omitted in the translation in BASOR. 11 A more literal rendering may perhaps be "lay d o w n " instead of "lies." 12 Note the new rendering for this line; " w h o ascends the mountain" may perhaps be a euphemism for " w h o dies." " T h e bed of Fate" in the next line refers, of course, to death. 13 "The standing" and "the sitting" may perhaps refer to those citizens who participate in the city assembly; cf. now Kramer, A]A, LIII, 14. 14 Namtar, "Fate," is the nether-world demon responsible for death. 15 For the gilburru, cf. lines 195 and 220 of the "Lamentation over the Destruction of Ur."

18 Note the new rendering; it is due to the suggestion of Frederick Geers, of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, that the second Sumerian sign in the line is si rather than KUG. 19 The new rendering assumes that the contents of this line parallel those of the preceding lines; a more literal rendering might perhaps read "one who puts (his) hand on everything." 20 Note the new rendering; the real meaning of the line and its relationship to what precedes and follows, remain obscure. 21 The gods listed in lines 9-13 are all underworld deities: Ereshkigal is the well-known queen of the nether world; Namtar is the demon of death; Dimpikug's duties are unknown; Neti is the chief gatekeeper of the nether world; Ningishzida and Dumuzi are two well-known chthonic deities. 22 The deities listed in lines 14-17 are described in line 18 as "the parents" of the leading Sumerian deity Enlil; they are all known as such from other texts, and were no doubt conceived by the theologians and mythographers as dwelling in the nether world. 23 Note the new renderings in lines 19-28; particularly the word "to" at the beginning of lines 19-26 is by no means assured; nor is the assumption that the deities and priests listed in them are to be thought of as inhabiting the nether world. In the present fragmentary state of the text, and particularly of the crucial lines 26-27, it is difficult to get at the real meaning of the passage contained in lines 14-28. As for the deities mentioned, Shulpae, "the lord of the table," is the husband of Ninhursag, one of the four creating deities of Sumer (see note 17); Sumugan is known as the god in charge of the "plain," and the animal and plant life which fills it; the Anunnaki and the Igigi are groups of deities whose individual members are unnamed (the Anunnaki in particular are frequently mentioned as participating in the divine assemblies); the Dukug is the chamber in heaven where Igigi and particularly the Anunnaki are said to live; it seems to be described in one text as "the place of the creation of the gods." 24 T h e sangu, mahhu, and palilu are priests: the entu is a priestess. 25 "Offerings" instead of "to the seer" in BASOR. 28 T h e word "bread" was erroneously omitted in BASOR.

Inanna's Descent to the Nether World
The Sumerian myth "Inanna's Descent to the Nether World" is highly significant for the light on the Sumero-Babylonian religious tenets, particularly those concerning death and the nether world. Moreover, as the predecessor and prototype of the Semitic myth "Ishtar's Descent to the Nether World," it provides us with an ancient and highly instructive example of literary borrowing and transformation. Briefly sketched, its contents run as follows: For some unknown reason,1 Inanna, queen of heaven, has set her heart upon visiting the nether world. She therefore collects all the appropriate divine ordinances, adorns herself with her queenly robes and jewels, and is ready to enter the "land of no return." Queen of the nether world is her older sister, and—at least so it seems—bitter enemy, Ereshkigal. Fearing lest her sister put her to death in the nether world, Inanna instructs her messenger Ninshubur, who is always at her beck and call, that if after three days she shall have failed to return,2 he is to set up a hue and cry for her in heaven, in the assembly hall of the gods. He is then to go to Nippur, the city of Enlil, and plead with the latter to save Inanna and not let her be put to death in the nether world. If Enlil refuses he is to go to Ur, the city of the moon-god Nanna, and repeat his plea. If Nanna, too, refuses, he is to go to Eridu, the city of Enki, the god of wisdom, and the latter, who "knows the food of life," who "knows the water of life," will surely come to her rescue.
Inanna then descends to the nether world and approaches Ereshkigal's temple of lapis lazuli. At the gate she is met by the chief gatekeeper, who demands to know who she is and why she has come. Inanna concocts a false excuse for her visit, and the gatekeeper, upon instructions from his mistress, leads her through the seven gates of the nether world. As she passes through each of the gates her garments and jewels are removed piece by piece in spite of her protests. Finally, after entering the last gate, she is brought stark naked and on bended knees before
27 Because of its fragmentary state, the meaning of the passage contained in lines 32-40 is altogether obscure; the renderings and the punctuation are quite uncertain throughout these lines. Note, too, the new renderings of lines 38 and 40. 28 The word "lord" was erroneously omitted in BASOR.
1 Hitherto it has been almost universally assumed that Inanna's descent to the nether world was for the purpose of saving Dumuzi (i.e. Tammuz), who supposedly was being held there against his will. As can be seen from note 6 (below), however, these assumptions were quite erroneous; the reason for Inanna's descent to the land of no return still remains unknown. 2 This time limit is not stated explicidy in Inanna's instructions, but cf. lines 169 ff.
and epic tales
Ereshkigal and the Anunnaki,8 the seven dreaded judges of the nether world. These fasten upon her their "eye" of death and she is turned into a corpse which is then hung from a stake.4 So pass three days and three nights. On the fourth day Ninshubur, seeing that his mistress has not returned, proceeds to make the rounds of the gods in accordance with his instructions. As Inanna had predicted, both Enlil and Nanna refuse all help. Enki, however, devises a plan to restore her to life. He fashions the \urgarru and the \alaturru, two sexless creatures, and entrusts to them the "food of life" and die "water of life," with instructions to proceed to the nether world and sprinkle this "food" and "water" (probably) sixty times upon Inanna's impaled corpse.5 This they do, and Inanna revives. As she leaves the nether world, however, she is accompanied by the dead and by the bogeys and harpies who have their home there. Surrounded by this ghosdy, ghasdy crowd she wanders from city to city in Sumer.®
The text of "Inanna's Descent to the Nether World," is reconstructed from thirteen tablets and fragments, all of which were excavated in Nippur and are now either in the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul or in the University Museum in Philadelphia. All were actually inscribed in the first half of the second millennium B.C. but the date of the first composition
s The Anunnaki, to judge from the available Sumerian material, are the unnamed "great gods" of the Sumerian pantheon who participated in the assemblies called by the leading deities before making final decisions; they were conceived as begotten by the heaven-god Anu on the "mountain of heaven and earth" (cf. SM, 72-3). Presumably, therefore, they were skygods, and just how the Sumerian mythographers got seven of them to the nether world to act as judges in it (cf. line 63 of our myth) is as yet unknown. * This seems to be the literal meaning of the Sumerian; presumably, the stake projected from a wall and pierced the dead body which thus "hung from it." 5 Enki gave the two creatures quite a number of additional instructions, which would, no doubt, prove highly revealing for Sumerian mythological concepts and religious tenets concerning death and the nether world; but unfortunately the relevant lines (224-242 and lines 246-265) are largely destroyed. 6 To this summary, which is based on the text of the myth as reconstructed in PAPS, LXXXV (cf. the paragraph following our summary) there can now be made a most important addition based on an as-yet-unpublished tablet in the Yale Babylonian Collection, which I had the opportunity of studying some time ago through the courtesy of Ferris J. Stephens, curator of the Yale Babylonian Collection, and Albrecht Goetze, his colleague. This tablet contains 91 lines of text; it begins with line 264 of the text as reconstructed in PAPS and duplicates the latter until line 323; from there on the text of the Yale tablet fills in part of the 40-line gap mentioned on p. 302 of PAPS, LXXXV. With the help of this new material, the events which took place upon Inanna's departure from the nether world are seen to be as follows: As soon as Inanna leaves the nether world with her ghosdy and demoniac companions, she is met by her messenger Ninshubur, who throws himself at her feet, sits in the dirt, and dresses in mourning. H i e demons accompanying Inanna seem to threaten to carry him off to the nether world, but Inanna tells them who he is and how he had served her faithfully, and—this is not quite certain—that consequently they should do him no harm. They then proceed to Umma and its temple Sigkurshagga; here Shara, the tutelary deity of Umma, threw himself at her feet, sat in the dirt and dressed in mourning. The demons accompanying Inanna seem to threaten to carry him off to the nether world, but Inanna (if the interpretation is correct) dissuades them. They then proceed to Badtibira and its temple Emushkalamma; here Latarak, the tutelary deity of Badtibira, threw himself at her feet, sat in the dirt, and dressed in mourning. Once again the demons seem to ^threaten to carry off the god, and once again Inanna seems to dissuade them. They then proceed to a city whose name is uncertain; it may perhaps be Inanna's own city Erech, since its temple complex seems to be named Kullab, a district in, or adjacent to, Erech. And here comes what is, no doubt, the most surprising and revealing part of the text. In Kullab(P), the god Dumuzi, unlike the gods Ninshubur, Shara of Umma, and Latarak of Badtibira, does not throw himself at Inanna's feet; nor does he show any signs of mourning. Instead, he seats himself on a "high seat" totally unmindful of Inanna and her companions. Whereupon Inanna hands Dumuzi over into the hands of the demons, no doubt to carry him off to the nether world. Dumuzi bursts into tears and raises his hands in prayer to the sun-god Utu to save him from the demons. At this point our text breaks off, so that the end of the myth is still unknown.

Landsberger has sent me some valuable comment on the PAPS edition, some of which will be quoted in the notes. 9 The "great above" is the space above the sky; the "great below" is the space below the surface of the earth. 10 This and the following lines mention seven important cities of Sumer together with Inanna's temple in each; the order is not significant since it varies considerably in one of the duplicates. 11 For "ordinances" which attempts to render the Sumerian word me, cf. p. 43 of this work. It is to be noted that judging from our text, these "ordinances" seem to be concrete and tangible objects; note, too, that in the myth "Inanna and Enki: T h e Transfer of the Arts of Civilization from Eridu to Erech" (SM, 64-68), they were transported on a boat. T h e rendering of lines 14-25 varies to some extent from that in PAPS, LXXXV. In line 14, the new rendering is based on Landsberger's (cf. note 8) note that zag—SIR is equated with \issuru in C T , x v i , 25, 49 (Falkenstein's interpretation of the compound in AfO, xiv, 1 1 5 and ZA, XLVII, 168 f., is therefore incorrect). For "gathered" instead of "sought out" in line 14, cf. Falkenstein, AfO, xiv, 1 1 5 ; for "wig" instead of "radiance" in line 18 cf. ibid., 117-118. For the new rendering of line 19, cf. Witzel's excellent comment in Orientalia N S , xiv, 32-33; Landsberger, moreover, refers to the Burney Relief discussed by Frankfort in AfO, XII, 129 ff. which actually shows the rod and line in the hands of a female deity. While, therefore, the translations "measuring r o d " and " l i n e " are reasonably certain, there is some difficulty with the words "of lapis lazuli" since "the line" should, of course, be made of rope, not of stone; Landsberger therefore suggests the

possibility that "lapis lazuli" is here used for the color "blue." In line 21, "twin" may be preferable to "sparkling"; the Sumerian word is ambiguous.

Falkenstein, loc. at., 1 1 6 ; for the new rendering of line 24, cf. ibid., 1 1 6 - 1 1 7 ; " k o h l " (line 25) was suggested by Landsberger, but cf. already Falkenstein, loc. cit., 1 1 . 12 One of the duplicates has an interesting variant for lines 29-31, which reads as follows: "Come, my faithful messenger of Eanna, Instruction I offer thee, take my instruction, A word I speak to thee, give ear to it." 13 " T r u e " rather than "supporting" as in PAPS, LXXX, cf. Falkenstein, loc. cit., 130.
14 The translation assumes that "the house of the gods" (line 36) and the "assembly shrine" of the preceding line refer to places in heaven where the gods met in assembly. Perhaps, however, the two lines refer to Ninshubur's making the rounds of the gods in Nippur, Ur, and Eridu; if so, "shrine" and "house" (lines 35, 36) should read "shrines" and "houses," and "rush about" might perhaps read "make the rounds." 15 T h e rendering "scratch" is suggested by Landsberger. cf. perhaps, the similar practices in connection with the dead, which are prohibited in the Old Testament. 18 For the rendering " w i t h m a n , " cf. Falkenstein, loc. cit., 119. 17 " A l l alone" was accidentally omitted in PAPS, LXXXV. 18 For "be covered" instead of "be ground up," in PAPS, LXXXV, cf. Falkenstein, loc. cit., 120. It is difficult to see what " t h y good metal," "thy good lapis lazuli," "thy boxwood," are intended to refer to; on the surface it might seem that they refer to the jewels and ornaments carried by Inanna, but if so, w h a t does "thy boxwood" refer to? Falkenstein (loc. cit., 1 2 1 ) suggests that these phrases are figurative descriptions of Inanna's body; such usage, however, is as yet without parallel in Sumerian literature.

On the other hand, the passage describing Inanna's dress preparatory to her descent (lines 17-25), consists of nine lines, each of which seems to describe a specific unit of apparel or ornament; omitted in the later passage are the wig and the kohl. Interesting, too, is a variant text in which the measuring rod and line were removed even before she entered the first gate. 39 This phrase should not have been italicized on p. 308 of PAPS, LXXXV. 40 This translation which makes excellent sense is suggested by Falkenstein, loc. cit., 126; it is nevertheless italicized as doubtful in our translation, since, as Witzel points out (loc. cit., 44-45), the form would be expected to read si-ga rather than ti-a as it appears in our text 41 A more literal rendering of the verb would read "have been perfected."

The Duties and Powers of the
Gods: Inscription on the Statue
of King Kurigalzu
Aqar Quf, the tell covering the ancient city Dur-Kurigalzu, is situated approximately twenty miles west of Baghdad. Excavations at the site in recent years have laid bare several temples, the most important of which is the Eugal, that is probably "the house of the great lord," dedicated to the god Enlil. In the debris covering this temple, or in its immediate neighborhood, were found four inscribed fragments1 of a larger-than-life statue of the Kassite King Kurigalzu.2 The inscription, written throughout in the Sumerian language and not in the Semitic Akkadian that was actually current in those days, is of great importance for the light it sheds on the religious tenets of the Babylonians of the second millennium B.C. For, fragmentary and obscure as the extant text is,* it is dear that much of the original inscription was devoted to a description of the duties and powers of the more important deities of the Sumerian pantheon. A scientific edition of the text of the four fragments, including copies of the originals, and a transliteration and translation of the more intelligible portions, was published by Selim Levy, Taha Baqir, and the present writer in Sumer, iv (1948), 1-29-f-ix plates.4
Fragment A5
This fragment begins with a passage running from col. i to perhaps col. v, which seems to concern the Igigi, the gods
71 The first two lines might be expected to contain words of praise for Inanna; die third probably contained a statement not to harm him (cf. note 68). 72 cf. however note 6.
1 One tiny fragment not included here contains only two legible signs. 2 Probably Kurigalzu I; cf. Poebel, AS, No. 14, 5 ff. and note 20; he lived sometime in the fifteenth century B.C. s Unfortunately there is but litde that can be gleaned with certainty from the contents of these fragments. In the first place they contain but a small portion of the entire text of the statue. Moreover, none of the pieces joins; there is a break of unknown length between each two of them, and so there is very litde connected text to provide us with a controlling context. In addition we find, of course, the expected number of roots and complexes whose meaning is either uncertain or altogether unknown. And, to crown all these difficulties which the cuneiformist has learned more or less to expect as routine, our Kurigalzu inscription {»resents an unusual feature which is particularly confusing. As was first pointed out hy C. J. Gadd, the columns are divided into cases usually containing two or three signs written without any regard to the expected word division, so that it is often difficult 'u tell where one word or complex ends and another begins.
4 c f . C. I. Gadd's comment in Iraq, Supplement, 1944, p. 15, and Arno Poebel's illuminating study, T h e City of Esa, in AS, No. 14, 1-22. 5 T h e order of the four fragments is far from assured; cf. Sumer, iv, 2-3, for a discussion of the problems involved.

Badna, and the Anunnaki;6 it is so fragmentary, however, that its sense escapes us. Beginning with, perhaps, the middle of col. v and ending with col. vii, we find a description of the duties assigned to the moon-god Nanna which ends in a passage stating that the Igigi directed the cult-rites for Nanna from the Eugal of heaven, and that Kurigalzu reestablished "the ancient days." The remainder of the fragment continues with a description of the duties and powers assigned, perhaps by the gods Enlil and Ninlil, to a deity whose name is not found in the extant text. The translation of the more intelligible portions of this fragment reads as follows:
(i) (practically completely destroyed) (ii) . . . they . .. d. The light of the Igigi (and) the gods Badna1 was covered up by its (their?) . . . The Jgi[gi]· (iii) He (she?) does not . . .

fragment B
This fragment consists of two parts, a and b, whose relative positions in the inscription are quite uncertain. Bb is here given first since it seems to treat of matters involving the moon, and its text may therefore have preceded or followed that of fragment A.
(Bb i) For the . . . of his trust they made known its
6 The rendering "the gods Badna" is quite uncertain; according to a suggestion from Falkenstein, it may represent a phrase descriptive of the preceding Igigi. 7 cf. preceding note. 8 cf. for this column also Poebel, AS, N o . 14, 19. 9 It begins with a phrase which seems to read "held (sot not "hold" as in Sumer, iv, 6) in their arms" This is followed by the end of the sentence which seems to read: "A naditu-priestess (in Sumer, 1v, 6 munus-di! is an error for SAL.ME) a hierodule w h o marks the . . . of the fields in accordance with die judgment of (the sun-god) Utu ( a n d ) the lord filled with wailing prepared . . .

T h e remaining cases contain the words "sickness," "lament," and "outcry" 10 cf. also Poebel, AS, No. 14, 19-20. 11 Nammu, the mother of die Sumerian water-god and god of wisdom, Enki, is probably the goddess of the primeval sea and was said to have given "birth to heaven and earth," cf.

Fragment C
Fragment C begins with the assignment of duties and powers to the goddess Ninisinna,14 and ends with a passage stating that the Igigi directed the cult-rkes for her from the Eugal of heaven, and that Kurigalzu reestablished "the ancient days"; in other words, a passage which, except for the name of the deity, is identical with that which closes the portion of the text of A, dealing with the god Nanna. The fragment then continues with the duties and powers assigned to the god Nergal, the husband of Ninisinna and king of the nether world; it, too, probably ends with the "cult-rites" passage that marks the close of the Nanna and Ninisinna passages.

Akkadian Myths and Epics
T R A N S L A T O R : E. A. SPEISER
The material here offered is intended to be representative rather than exhaustive. It is not always possible to draw a sharp line between Akkadian compositions devoted to myths and related material, and those that concern other types of religious literature, not to mention special categories of historical nature. Furthermore, considerations of space and time have tended to exclude sundry literary remains whose bearing on the purpose of this work is not immediately apparent. It is hoped, however, that nothing of genuine relevance has been omitted. As regards the order of the individual subjects, it was deemed advisable to present in succession the two major survivals of this group of texts, namely, The Creation Epic and The Epic of Gilgamesh. The alternative procedure would have been to group some of the minor subjects with the one epic, and some with the other. The present arrangement has a sound biblical precedent in the order of the books of the Prophets. In translating material which has come down to us in poetic form, there arises the inevitable conflict between adherence to the force and flavor of the original idiom—as that idiom is understood—and adherence to the given poetic form. In the present instance, preference was given to the demands of meaning, whenever necessary. Elsewhere slight exceptions have been made in an effort to reflect the measures of the Akkadian versenormally a unit of two distinct halves with two beats in each half. Where the text presents an overlong line as a result of a mechanical combination of two verses, the added verse has been indented in the translation so as not to alter the line count of the text. In lines grown unwieldy for other reasons—such as theological addition in the original, or the helplessness of the translator when confronted with the economy or the elusiveness of the Akkadian idiom—indentation has likewise proved to be a convenient device.
The strong temptation to indicate logical transitions in the context by means of paragraphing has been resisted on the ground that such divisions might be regarded as arbitrary. Where, however, the text suggests paragraphing by means of horizontal lines (as in The Epic of Gilgamesh), the translation has followed suit by resorting to added spacing. Virtually all of the material included under this heading has had the benefit of painstaking study over a period of many years. The principal editions of the texts and the latest discussions and translations are listed in the respective introductions to the individual subjects. Each revision is indebted to some extent to its various predecessors. My own debt to my colleagues, past and present, is too great to be acknowledged in detail. I have tried, however, to note explicidy such appropriated improvements and observations as may not as yet have become the common property of Assyriological scholarship. In fairness to others, it was necessary also to call attention to the occasional departures for which I alone must bear the responsibility. The existing gaps in the texts, at any rate, and the lacunae in our understanding of what is extant, are still much too formidable for anything like a definitive translation.
The Creation Epic
The struggle between cosmic order and chaos was to the ancient Mesopotamians a fateful drama that was renewed at the turn of each new year. The epic which deals with these events was therefore the most significant expression of the religious
literature of Mesopotamia. The work, consisting of seven tablets, was known in Akkadian as Enuma eliS "When on high," after its opening words. It was recited with due solemnity on the fourth day of the New Year's festival. Portions of this work were first made available in modern times by George Smith, in The Chaldean Account of Genesis (1876). The flow of material has continued intermittendy ever since. We owe these texts to three main sources: (a) The British excavations at Nineveh; the relevant texts have been published in C T , XIII (1901) and in L. W . King's The Seven Tablets of Creation (2 Vols., 1902). (b) The German excavations at Ashur; texts in E. Ebeling's Keilschrifttexte aus Assur religiosen Inhalts (1915 ff.). (c) The British-American excavations at Kish; texts in S. Langdon's Oxford Editions of Cuneiform Texts (1923 ff.; Vol. vi). Scattered fragments have appeared in the periodical publications. A convenient compilation of the texts has been given by A. Deimel in his Enuma Elii (2nd ed., 1936). This book contains a useful textual apparatus, but it does not altogether eliminate the need for comparison with the basic publications. In recent years, large gaps in Tablet VII have been filled by E. Ebeling in MAOG, XII (1939), part 4, and these additions have been supplemented and elucidated by W. von Soden in ZA, XLVII (1942), 1-26. The only part that still is largely unknown is Tablet V.
The various studies and translations of this epic are too numerous for a complete survey. The more recent ones include: S. Langdon, The Babylonian Epic of Creation (1923); E. Ebeling, AOT, 108 ff.; R. Labat, Le poime babylon'ten de la creation (1935); and A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis (1942). For the sake of ready reference, I have retained the line count employed by Labat. Heidel's careful translation could scarcely be overestimated in its usefulness. Except for the portions of Tablet VII, which have appeared since, it constituted the fullest rendering possible at the time of its publication. Attention should also be called to W. von Soden's grammatical study, Der hymnischepische Dialekt des Akkadischen, ZA, XL-XLI (1932 f.), and to A. L. Oppenheim's notes on Mesopotamian Mythology I, Orientalia, xvi (1947), 207-38. There is as yet no general agreement as regards the date of composition. None of the extant texts antedates the first millennium B.C. On the internal evidence, however, of the context and the linguistic criteria, the majority of die scholars would assign die epic to the Old Babylonian period, i.e. the early part of the second millennium B.C. There does not appear to be any convincing reason against this earlier dating. The poem is cast in metric form. One seventh-century copy of Tablet IV, for instance, still shows plainly the division of lines into halves, thus bringing out the two beats of each half. Theological, political, and exegetical considerations have led to various changes and additions, but these are readily recognized for the most part thanks to the underlying metric framework.1 Unfortunately, a translation cannot make use of this type of evidence, however obvious it may be. In general, the successive revisions have marred the poetic effect of the whole. Nevertheless, enough passages have come down intact to bear witness to a genuine literary inspiration in many instances.

Firm ground below had not been called by name,
Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter,
(And) Mummu2-Tiamat, she who bore them all,
Their8 waters commingling as a single body;
No reed hut* had been matted, no marsh land had
appeared, When no gods whatever had been brought into being,
Uncalled by name, their destinies undetermined
Then it was that the gods were formed within them.5
Lahmu and Lahamu were brought forth, by name they were called. (10)
Before they had grown in age and stature.
Anshar and Kishar were formed, surpassing the others.
They prolonged the days, added on the years.8
Anu was their heir, of his fathers the rival;
Yea, Anshar's first-born, Anu, was his equal.
Anu begot in his image Nudimmud.7
This Nudimmud was of his fathers the master;8
Of broad wisdom, understanding, mighty in strength,
Mightier by far than his grandfather, Anshar.
He had no rival among the gods, his brothers.® (20)
The divine brothers banded together,
They disturbed Tiamat as they surged bac\ and forthTM
Yea, they troubled the mood11 of Tiamat
By their hilarity12 in the Abode of Heaven.
Apsu could not lessen their clamor
And Tiamat was speechless at their \ways\
Their doings were loathsome unto [ . . . ] .
Unsavory were their ways; they were overbearing.13
Then Apsu, the begetter of the great gods,
Cried out, addressing Mummu, his vizier: (30) "O Mummu, my vizier, who rejoicest my spirit,14
Come hither and let us go to Tiamat!"
They went and sat down before Tiamat,
Exchanging counsel about the gods, their first-born.
Apsu, opening his mouth,
Said unto resplendent Tiamat:
2 Not to be confused with the vizier Mummu, for grammatical reasons. Perhaps an epithet in the sense of "mother," as has long been suspected. On the various meanings of the term see now A. Heidel in JNES, VII (1948), 98-105. 3 i.e. the fresh waters of Apsu and the marine waters of Tiamat "the sea."
4 In this epic giparu indicates both the primitive building material—as in this passage; cf. E. Douglas Van Buren, Orientalia, xm (1944), 32—and a cult hut (Tablet I, 77). Both meanings can be reconciled on the basis of W. Andrae's researches into the origin of Mesopotamian shrine architecture; cf. his Das Gotteshaus und die Urformen des Bauens im alien Orient (1930). Note, however, that the initial gi of this word is not to be confused with Sumerian gi "reed."

15 This translation ignores a minor grammatical difficulty; the alternative "(spoke) with raised voice" (cf. Tablet III, 125) would have tocontcnd with etymological objections.

"Their ways are verily loathsome unto me. By day I find no relief,18 nor repose by night. I will destroy, I will wreck their ways, That quiet may be restored. Let us have rest!" (40) As soon as Tiamat heard this, She was wroth and called out to her husband. She cried out aggrieved, as she raged all alone, Injecting woe into her mood: "What? Should we destroy that which we have built? Their ways indeed are most troublesome, but let us attend17 kindly!" Then answered Mummu, giving counsel to Apsu; [Ill-wishing] and ungracious was Mummu's advice: "Do destroy, my father, the mutinous ways. Then shalt thou have relief by day and rest by night!" (50) When Apsu heard this, his face grew radiant Because of the evil he planned against the gods, his sons. As for Mummu, by the neck he embraced him As (that one) sat down on his knees to kiss him.18 (Now) whatever they had plotted between them, Was repeated unto the gods, their first-born. When the gods heard (this),19 they were astir, (Then) lapsed into silence and remained speechless. Surpassing in wisdom, accomplished, resourceful, Ea, the all-wise, saw through their20 scheme. (60) A master design against it he devised and set up, Made artful his spell against it, surpassing and holy. He recited it and made it subsist in the deep,21 As he poured sleep upon him. Sound asleep he lay.22 When Apsu he had made prone, drenched with sleep, Mummu, the adviser,23 was powerless to stir24 He loosened his band, tore off his tiara, Removed his halo25 (and) put it on himself.28 Having fettered Apsu, he slew him. Mummu he bound and left behind lock. (70) Having thus upon Apsu established his dwelling, He laid hold on Mummu, holding him by the nose-rope. After Ea had vanquished and trodden down his foes, Had secured his triumph over his enemies, In his sacred chamber in profound peace had rested, He named it "Apsu," for shrines he assigned (it). In that same place his cult hut27 he founded.
16 Not merely "rest," because of the "elative" force of the prefix 1-, a function as yet ignored in Akkadian grammars. 17 For this value of ladadu cf. Gilg. xn, 32 and the semantic range of the terms listed in Deimel, $L, 371, 73. 18 The Akkadian appears ambiguous as to subject and object. It would seem, however, that as Mummu came down to his knees, Apsu embraced him by the neck. 19 Var. "The gods were in tears." 20 That of Apsu and Mummu. 21 Lit. "caused it to be in the waters," viz. those of Apsu. 22 cf. F. W. Geers, JNES, iv (1945), 66. 23 Reading tam-la-\u with Heidel, BG, 10, n. 22. 24 cf. JCS, v ( 1 9 5 1 ) , 65 and n. 15. 25 Following the interpretation of A. L. Oppenheim, J AOS, LXIII (1943),
26 The rich crop of variant readings which the Akkadian versions furnish for this passage, and the consequent variety of interpretations, appear to be due to the use of an archaic pronominal form (su'a); cf. W. v. Soden, ZA,
*L (1932), 182.

Ea and Damkina,28 his wife, dwelled (there) in splendor. In the chamber of fates, the abode of destinies, A god was engendered, most able and wisest of gods. (80) In the heart of Apsu2" was Marduk80 created, In the heart of holy Apsu was Marduk created. He who begot him was Ea, his father; She who bore him was Damkina, his mother. The breast of goddesses he did suck.81 The nurse that nursed him filled him with awesomeness. Alluring was his figure, sparkling the lift of his eyes. Lordly was his gait, commanding from of old. When Ea saw him, the father who begot him, He exulted and glowed, his heart filled with gladness. (90) He rendered him perfect82 and endowed him with a double godhead.8* Greatly exalted was he above them, exceeding throughout. Perfect were his members beyond comprehension, Unsuited for understanding, difficult to perceive. Four were his eyes, four were his ears; When he moved his lips, fire blazed forth. Large were all four84 hearing organs, And the eyes, in like number, scanned all things. He was the loftiest of the gods, surpassing was his stature;
His members were enormous, he was exceeding tall. (100) "My little son, my little son!85 My son, the Sun! Sun of the heavens!" Clothed with the halo of ten gods, he was strong to the utmost, As their awesome flashes were heaped upon him. Anu brought forth and begot the fourfold wind Consigning to its power the leader of the host. He fashioned . . . , station [ed] the whirlwind,86 He produced streams to disturb Tiamat. The gods, given no rest, süßer in the storm. Their heart(s) having plotted evil, To Tiamat, their mother,87 said: "When they slew Apsu, thy consort, Thou didst not aid him but remainedst still.

When Tiamat had thus lent import to her handiwork, She prepared for battle against the gods, her offspring. To avenge Apsu, Tiamat wrought evil. That she was girding for batde, was divulged to Ea. As soon as Ea heard of this matter, He lapsed into dark silence and sat right still Then, on further thought, his anger subsided, To Anshar, his (fore)father he betook himself. When he came before his grandfather, Anshar, All that Tiamat had plotted to him he repeated: (10) "My father, Tiamat, she who bore us, detests us.

Note also the intransitive forms of this verb in the Legend of Zu (below), A 23, B 52. 58 The suffix -ki in the next line makes it apparent that the statement addressed to Anshar is an exact quotation of Anu's previous speech to Tiamat The context bears out this interpretation.

"My hand [suffices not for me to subdue thee." Speechless was Anshar as he stared at the ground, Hair on edge, shaking his head at Ea. All the Anunnaki gathered at that place; Their lips closed tight, [they sat] in silence. "No god" (thought they) "can go [to battle and], (90) Facing Tiamat, escape [with his life]." Lord Anshar, father of the gods, [rose up] in grandeur, And having pondered in his heart, he [said to the Anunnaki]: "He whose [strength] is potent shall be [our] avenger, He who is \een in battle, Marduk, the hero!" Ea called [Marduk] to his place of seclusion. [Giv]ing counsel, he told him what was in his heart:54 "O Marduk, consider my advice. Hearken to thy father, For thou art my son who comforts his55 heart. When facing Anshar, approach as though in combat; (100) Stand up as thou speakest; seeing thee, he will grow restful." The lord rejoiced at the word of his father; He approached and stood up facing Anshar. When Anshar saw him, his heart filled with joy. He kissed his lips, his (own) gloom dispelled. "[Anshar], be not muted; open wide thy lips. I will go and attain thy heart's desire. [Anshar], be not muted; open wide thy lips. I will go and attain thy heart's desire! What male is it who has pressed his fight against thee ? (110) [It is but] Tiamat, a woman, that flies at thee with weapons! [O my father-]creator, be glad and rejoice; The neck of Tiamat thou shalt soon tread upon! [O my father-]creator, be glad and rejoice; [The neck] of Tiamat thou shalt soon tread upon!" "My son, (thou) who knowest all wisdom, Calm [Tiamat] with thy holy spell. On the storm-ch[ariot] proceed with all speed. From her [presence] they shall not drive (thee)! Turn (them) back!"
The lord [rejoiced] at the word of his father. (120) His heart exulting, he said to his father: "Creator of the gods, destiny of the great gods, If I indeed, as your avenger, Am to vanquish Tiamat and save your lives, Set up the Assembly, proclaim supreme my destiny! When jointly in Ubshukinna58 you have sat down rejoicing, Let my word, instead of you, determine the fates. Unalterable shall be what I may bring into being; Neither recalled nor changed shall be the command of my lips."

Let all the gods proceed hither, Let them hold converse, sit down to a banquet, Let them eat festive bread, poured57 wine; For Marduk, their avenger, let them fix the decrees.

They held converse as they [sat down] to the banquet. They ate festive bread, poured [the wine], They wetted their drink ing-tubes"2 with sweet intoxicant. As they drank the strong drink, [their] bodies swelled. They became very languid as their spirits rose. For Marduk, their avenger, they fixed the decrees.
Tablet IV
They erected for him a princely throne. Facing his fathers, he sät down, presiding.68 "Thou art the most honored of the great gods, Thy decree is unrivaled, thy command is Anu.64 Thou, Marduk, art the most honored of the great gods, Thy decree is unrivaled, thy word is Anu. From this day unchangeable shall be thy pronouncement. To raise or bring low—these shall be (in) thy hand. Thy utterance shall be true, thy command shall be unimpeachable. No one among the gods shall transgress thy bounds! (10) Adornment being wanted for the seats of the gods, Let the place of their shrines ever be in thy place. O Marduk, thou art indeed our avenger. We have granted thee kingship over the universe entire. When in Assembly thou sittest, thy word shall be supreme. Thy weapons shall not fail; they shall smash thy foes! O lord, spare the life of him who trusts thee, But pour out the life of the god who seized evil." Having placed in their midst the Images, They addressed themselves to Marduk, their first-born: (20) "Lord, truly thy decree is first among gods. Say but to wreck or create; it shall be. Open thy mouth: the Images will vanish! Speak again, and the Images shall be whole!" At the word of his mouth the Images vanished. He spoke again, and the Images were restored. When the gods, his fathers, saw the fruit of his word,65 Joyfully they did homage: "Marduk is king!" They conferred on him scepter, throne, and vestment; They gave him matchless weapons that ward off the foes: (30) "Go and cut off the life of Tiamat. May the winds bear her blood to places undisclosed." Bel's destiny thus fixed, the gods, his fathers, Caused him to go the way of success and attainment. He constructed a bow, marked it as his weapon, Attached thereto the arrow, fixed its bow-cord. He raised the mace, made his right hand grasp it; Bow and quiver he hung at his side. In front of him he set the lightning,

With a blazing flame he filled his body. (40) He then made a net to enfold Tiamat therein. The four winds he stationed that nothing of her might escape, The South Wind, the North Wind, the East Wind, the West Wind. Close to his side he held the net, the gift of his father, Anu. He brought forth Imhullu "the Evil Wind," the Whirlwind, the Hurricane, The Fourfold Wind, the Sevenfold Wind, the Cyclone, the Matchless Wind; Then he sent forth the winds he had brought forth, the seven of them. To stir up the inside of Tiamat they rose up behind him. Then the lord raised up the flood-storm, his mighty weapon. He mounted the storm-chariot irresistible [and] terrifying. (50) He harnessed (and) yoked to it a team-of-four, The Killer, the Relentless, the Trampler, the Swift. (Their) lips were parted, their teeth bore poison. They were tireless and skilled in destruction. On his right he posted the Smiter, fearsome in battle, On the left the Combat, which repels all the zealous.66 For a cloak he was wrapped in an armor of terror;67 With his fearsome halo his head was turbaned. The lord went forth and followed his course, Towards the raging Tiamat he set his face. (60) In his lips he held a spell;68 A plant to put out poison was grasped in his hand. Then they milled about him, the gods milled about him, The gods, his fathers, milled about him, the gods milled about him. The lord approached to scan the inside of Tiamat, (And) of Kingu, her consort, the scheme to perceive. As he looks on, his course becomes upset, His will is distracted and his doings are confused. And when the gods, his helpers, who marched at his side, Saw the valiant hero, blurred became their vision. (70) Tiamat emitted [a cry],69 without turning her neck, Framing70 savage71 defiance in her lips:72 "Too [imp]ortant art thou [for]78 the lord of the gods to rise up against thee!

Is it in their place that they have gathered, (or) in thy place?" Thereupon the lord, having [raised] the flood-storm, his mighty weapon, [T]o enraged Tiamat he sent word as follows: "Why art thou risen,74 art haughtily exalted, Thou hast charged thine own heart to stir up conflict, . . . sons reject their own fathers, Whilst thou, who hast born them, hast foresworn love! (80) Thou hast appointed Kingu as thy consort, Conferring upon him the rank of Anu, not rightfully his.75 Against Anshar, king of the gods, thou seekest evil; [Against] the gods, my fathers, thou hast confirmed thy wickedness. [Though] drawn up be thy forces, girded on thy weapons, Stand thou up, that I and thou meet in single combat!" When Tiamat heard this, She was like one possessed; she took leave of her senses. In fury Tiamat cried out aloud. To the roots her legs shook both together.76 (90) She recites a charm, keeps casting her spell, While the gods of battle sharpen their weapons. Then joined issue Tiamat and Marduk, wisest of gods. They strove77 in single combat, locked in battle. The lord spread out his net to enfold her, The Evil Wind, which followed behind, he let loose in her face. When Tiamat opened her mouth to consume him, He drove in the Evil Wind that she close not her lips. As the fierce winds charged her belly, Her body was distended78 and her mouth was wide open. (100) He released the arrow, it tore her belly, It cut through her insides, splitting the heart. Having thus subdued her, he extinguished her life. He cast down her carcass to stand upon it After he had slain Tiamat, the leader, Her band was shattered, her troupe broken up; And the gods, her helpers who marched at her side, Trembling with terror, turned their backs about, In order to save and preserve their lives. Tightly encircled, they could not escape. ( n o ) He made them captives and he smashed their weapons. Thrown into the net, they found themselves ensnared; Placed in cells, they were filled with wailing; Bearing his wrath, they were held imprisoned.

And the eleven creatures which she had charged with awe, The whole band of demons that marched on her right, He cast into fetters, their hands he bound. For all their resistance, he trampled (them) underfoot And Kingu, who had been made chief among them, He bound and accounted him to Uggae.78 (120) He took from him the Tablet of Destinies, not rightfully his, Sealed (them) with a seal80 and fastened (them) on his breast When he had vanquished and subdued his adversaries, Had . . . the vainglorious foe, Had wholly established Anshar's triumph over the foe, Nudimmud's desire had achieved, valiant Marduk Strengthened his hold on the vanquished gods, And turned back to Tiamat whom he had bound. The lord trod on the legs of Tiamat, With his unsparing mace he crushed her skull. (130) When the arteries of her blood he had severed, The North Wind bore (it) to places undisclosed. On seeing this, his fathers were joyful and jubilant, They brought gifts of homage, they to him. Then the lord paused to view her dead body, That he might divide the monster and do artful works. He split her like a shellfish into two parts: Half of her he set up and ceiled it as sky, Pulled down the bar and posted guards. He bade them to allow not her waters to escape. (140) He crossed the heavens and surveyed the regions. He squared Apsu's quarter,81 the abode of Nudimmud, As the lord measured the dimensions of Apsu. The Great Abode, its likeness, he fixed as Esharra, The Great Abode, Esharra, which he made as the firmament Anu, Enlil, and Ea he made occupy their places.

He constructed stations for the great gods, Fixing their astral likenesses as the Images. He determined the year by designating the zones: He set up three constellations for each of the twelve months. After defining the days of the year [by means] of (heavenly) figures, He founded the station of Nebiru82 to determine their (heavenly) bands, That none might transgress or fall short. Alongside it he set up the stations of Enlil and Ea. Having opened up the gates on both sides, He strengthened the locks to the left and the right (10)

This station was taken to lie between the band (rik.su; cf. I. 6) of the north, which belonged to Enlil, and the band of the south, which belonged to Ea.

In her83 belly he established the zenith. The Moon he caused to shine, the night (to him) entrusting. He appointed him a creature of the night to signify the days: "Monthly, without form designs with a crown. At the month's very start, rising over the land, Thou shalt have luminous horns to signify six days, On the seventh day reaching a [half]-crown. At full moon84 stand in opposition88 in mid-month. When the sun [overtakes] thee at the base of heaven, Diminish [thy crown] and retrogress in light. (20) At the time [of disappearance] approach thou the course of the sun, And [on the thirtieth thou shalt again stand in opposition to the sun." (See Supplement)
Tablet VI
When Marduk hears the words of the gods, His heart prompts (him) to fashion artful works. Opening his mouth, he addresses Ea To impart the plan he had conceived in his heart: "Blood I will mass and cause bones to be. I will establish a savage,86 'man' shall be his name. Verily, savage-man I will create. He shall be charged with the service of the gods That they might be at ease! The ways of the gods I will artfully alter. Though alike revered, into two (groups) they shall be divided." (10) Ea answered him, speaking a word to him, Giving him another plan for the relief of the gods: "Let but one of their brothers be handed over; He alone shall perish that mankind may be fashioned.87 Let the great gods be here in Assembly, Let the guilty be handed over that they may endure." Marduk summoned the great gods to Assembly; Presiding88 graciously, he issues instructions. To his utterance the gods pay heed.89 The king addresses a word to the Anunnaki: (20) "If your former statement was true,

Do (now) the truth on oath by me declare!90 Who was it that contrived the uprising, And made Tiamat rebel, and joined battle? Let him be handed over who contrived the uprising. His guilt I will make him bear. You shall dwell in peace P' The Igigi, the great gods, replied to him, To Lugaldimmerankia,91 counselor of the gods, their lord:92 "It was Kingu who contrived the uprising, And made Tiamat rebel, and joined batdei." (30) They bound him, holding him before Ea. They imposed on him his guilt and severed his blood (vessels). Out of his blood they fashioned mankind. He98 imposed the service and let free the gods. After Ea, the wise, had created mankind, Had imposed upon it the service of the godsThat work was beyond comprehension; As artfully planned by Marduk, did Nudimmud create itMarduk, the king of the gods divided All the Anunnaki above and below.94 (40) He assigned (them) to Anu to guard his instructions. Three hundred in the heavens he stationed as a guard. In like manner the ways of the earth he defined. In heaven and on earth six hundred (thus) he settled. After he had ordered all the instructions, To the Anunnaki of heaven and earth had allotted their portions, The Anunnaki opened their mouths And said to Marduk, their lord: "Now,95 O lord, thou who hast caused our deliverance, What shall be our homage to thee ?

Let its brickwork be fashioned. You shall name it98 'The Sanctuary.'" The Anunnaki applied the implement; For one whole year they molded bricks. (60) When the second year arrived,

They raised high the head" of Esagila equaling Apsu. Having built a stage-tower as high as Apsu, They set up in it an abode for Marduk, Enlil, (and) Ea In their presence he was seated in grandeur. To the base of Esharra101 its horns look down. After they had achieved the building of Esagila, All the Anunnaki erected their shrines. The three hundred Igigi all of them gathered, The lord being on the lofty dais which they had built as his abode, (70) The gods, his fathers, at his banquet102 he seated: "This is Babylon, the place that is your home!10' Make merry in its precincts, occupy its broad [places].'

When they beheld the bow, how skillful its shape, His fathers praised the work he had wrought Raising (it), Anu spoke up in the Assembly of the gods, As he kissed the bow: "This is my daughter!" He named the names of the bow as follows: "Longwood is the first, the second is Accurate;109 Its third name is Bow-Star, in heaven I have made (90) it shine."

with life, (130) The service of the gods he imposed that these may have ease. Creation, destruction, deliverance, graceShall be by his command.119 They shall look up to him! (2) MARUKKA verily is the god, creator of all, Who gladdens the heart of the Anunnaki, appeases the
Igigi· (3) MARUTUKKU verily is the refuge of his land, city, and people. Unto him shall the people give praise forever. (4) BARASHAKUSHU117 stood up and took hold of its118 reins; Wide is his heart, warm his sympathy. (5) LUGALDIMMERANKIA is his name which we proclaimed in our Assembly. (140) His commands we have exalted above the gods, his fathers. Verily, he is lord of all the gods of heaven and underworld The king at whose discipline the gods above and below are in mourning. 119

T h e text etymologizes the names in a manner made familiar by the Bible; the etymologies, which accompany virtually every name on the long list are meant to be cabalistic and symbolic rather than stricdy linguistic, although some of them happen to be linguistically sound.

At his name the gods shall tremble and quake in retreat. (7) A S A R U L U D U is that name of his Which Anu, his father, proclaimed for him. He is truly the light of the gods, the mighty leader, Who, as the protecting deities128 of gods and land, (150) In fierce single combat saved our retreats in distress. Asaruludu, secondly, they have named (8) N A M T I L L A K U , The god who maintains life,128 Who restored the lost gods, as though his own creation; The lord who revives the dead gods by his pure incantation, Who destroys the wayward foes. Let us praise his prowess!124 Asaruludu, whose name was thirdly called (9) N A M R U , The shining god who illumines our ways." Three each of his names125 have Anshar, Lahmu, and Lahamu proclaimed; Unto the gods, their sons, they did utter them: "We have proclaimed three each of his names. (160) Like us, do you utter his names!" Joyfully the gods did heed their command, As inUbshukinna they exchanged counsels: "Of the heroic son, our avenger, Of our supporter we will exalt the name!" They sat down in their Assembly to fashion186 destinies, All of them uttering his names in the sanctuary.

1 3 5 Lit. "sets up." 136 This meaning of gugallu fails to come through in v. Soden's rendering as "Walter." Attention may be called to my translation in AASOR, x v i (1936), 95- The term starts out with the value of "inspector of canals" and is thence transferred to the weather-gods (Adad; cf. Ennuge in Gilg., XI, 6). Eventually it comes to be applied to gods of vegetation and fertility, but in most contexts, including the present, the original connection is still apparent, cf. Th. Jacobsen, JNES, v (1946), 130. 1 3 7 v.

Let them be kept (in mind) and let the leader explain them.158 Let the wise and the knowing discuss (them) together. Let the father recite (them) and impart to his son. Let the ears of shepherd and herdsman be opened. Let him rejoice in Marduk, the Enlil of the gods, That his land may be fertile and that he may prosper. (15°) Firm in his order, his command unalterable, The utterance of his mouth no god shall change. When he looks he does not turn away his neck; When he is angry, no god can withstand his wrath. Vast is his mind, broad his sympathy,
Sinner and transgressor may come before him.

The Epic of Gilgamesh
The theme of this epic is essentially a secular one. The poem deals with such earthy things as man and nature, love and adventure, friendship and combat—all masterfully blended into a background for the stark reality of death. The climactic struggle of the protagonist to change his eventual fate, by learning the secret of immortality from the hero of the Great Flood of long ago, ends in failure; but with the failure comes a sense of quiet resignation. For the first time in the history of the world a profound experience on such a heroic scale has found expression in a noble style. The scope and sweep of the epic, and its sheer poetic power, give it a timeless appeal. In antiquity, the influence of the poem spread to various tongues and cultures. Today it captivates student and poet alike. The Akkadian tide of the poem, which was taken as usual from the opening words, is Sa nagba imuru, "He who saw everything." The prevailing meter has the normal four beats to a line. The work is divided into twelve tablets. The longest of these contains over three hundred lines. It happens to be the so-called Flood Tablet (XI), virtually in a perfect state of preservation. The rest has survived in portions, some of considerable size and others in relatively small fragments. All but a few of the Ak

kadian texts come from the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. Unlike the Creation Epic, however, the Gilgamesh Epic is known also from versions which antedate the first millennium B.C. From the middle of the second millennium have come down fragments of an Akkadian recension current in the Hittite Empire, and the same Bogazkoy archives have yielded also important fragments of a Hittite translation, as well as a fragment of a Hurrian rendering of the epic. From the first half of the second millennium we possess representative portions of the Old Babylonian version of the epic, which pertain to Tablets I-III, and X. That this version was itself a copy of an earlier text is suggested by the internal evidence of the material. The original date of composition of the Akkadian work has to be placed at the turn of the second millennium, if not slighdy earlier. The connection between the Epic of Gilgamesh as we know it in its Akkadian form, and its various Sumerian analogues, has been clarified in recent years thanks to the work of C. J. Gadd on the Epic of Gilgamesh, Tablet XII, RA, xxxi (1933), 126 if., and especially by the studies of S. N. Kramer; see his summary in The Epic of Gilgamesh and its Sumerian Sources, J AOS, LXIV (1944), 7 ff. It has been demonstrated that Tablet XII is not of a piece with the other eleven tablets of the poem, but is instead a literal translation from the Sumerian. The epic proper, on the other hand, while utilizing certain motifs which are featured in Sumerian poems, does so largely in the course of developing a central theme that has no Sumerian prototype. In other words, the first eleven tablets of the Akkadian poem of Gilgamesh constitute an instance of creative borrowing which, substantially, amounts to an independent creation.1 The text of the Assyrian version, is now available in the model edition published, with transliteration and notes, by R. Campbell Thompson under the tide of The Epic of Gilgamish (1930). Thompson's arrangement and line count have been adopted in this translation, except for the passages that have been allocated otherwise, as will be noted in each given instance. The sources of the texts not given by Thompson will be cited in detail in the course of the translation. Of the literature on the subject only a small selection can be listed. One cannot fail, however, to cite the work of Peter Jensen, antiquated though it may be in some respects, for no scholar has done more than he to bring the epic to the attention of the modern world. The translation, transliteration, and notes in his Assyrisch-babylonische Mythen und Epen (Keilinschriftliche Bibliothe\, vi, 1900) remain useful to this day; and his monumental Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur (Vol. 1, 1906; Vol. 11, 1926) testifies to his enduring preoccupation with this subject. Important progress was made by A. Ungnad and H. Gressmann, Das Gilgamesch-Epos (1919), and Ungnad returned to the subject on two subsequent occasions: Die Religion der Babylonier und Assyrer (1921), and Gilgamesch-Epos und Odyssee (Kulturfragen, 4/5, 1923). E. Ebeling contributed a translation to AOT (2nd ed., 1926). The standard German translation is now that of A. Schott, Das Gilgamesch-Epos (1934). In English we have R. Campbell Thompson's translation into hexameters, entided The Epic of Gilgamish (1928). To W. E. Leonard we owe a rendering into free rhythms, entided Gilgamesh (1934), based on a German translation by H. Ranke. The book of G. Contenau, Uipopie de Gilgamesh is more valuable perhaps for its general orientation than for the particular contribution of the translation. An informed translation accompanied by brief notes has been published by F. M. Bohl under the Dutch tide Het Gilgamesj-Epos (1941). The latest and most dependable translation in English, with brief notes and an extensive discussion of the biblical· parallels is that of A. Heidel, The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels (1946). I have profited considerably from Heidel's treatment, as I have also from that of

"Thou, Aruru, didst create [the man]; Create now his double;11 His stormy heart12 let him match. Let them contend, that Uruk may have peace!" When Aruru heard this, A double of Anu she conceived within her. Aruru washed her hands, Pinched off clay and cast it on the steppe.18 [On the step]pe she created valiant Enkidu, Offspring of . . . , essence14 of Ninurta. [Sha]ggy15 with hair is his whole body, He is endowed with head hair like a woman. The locks of his hair sprout like Nisaba.16 He knows neither people nor land; Garbed is he like Sumuqan." With the gazelles he feeds on grass, With the wild beasts he josdes18 at the watering-place, (40) With the teeming creatures his heart delights in water. (Now) a hunter, a trapping-man,19 Faced him at the watering-place. [One] day, a second, and a third He faced him at the watering-place. When the hunter saw him, his face became motionless.
10 A goddess. 11 Lit. "evocation, image." 12 Lit. "the storm of his heart." 18 Where Enkidu was to be born. Other possible translations are "drew a design upon it," or "spat upon it." 14 The second of the four Akkadian terms used to describe Enkidu remains uncertain as to meaning; even the pronunciation of the ambiguous first sign is still undecided. As regards hi-fir, there are too many possible meanings. Furthermore, the one adopted for this passage should also apply to I, iii, 4, 3 1 ; VI, 3, 23; II, i, 7: die war-god Ninurta, and the sky-god Anu, Enkidu, and something that fell down from heaven. The common assumption that the author may have used in these passages the same term in more than one sense is unsatisfactory. In the earlier edition I tried to justify for kjsru the rendering "liegeman" for the several passages in question. I now withdraw that suggestion. The correct sense, I believe, is indicated by the use of the term in medicinal contexts as "concentration, essence," cf. E. Ebeling, fCS, IV ( 1 9 5 0 ) , 2 1 9 . "Esscnce," or some nuance of this term, could well be applied to deities as well as to missiles from heaven. Our poet had in mind, no doubt, some specific allusion, but the general meaning appears clear enough.

20 T h e verb ala\u means both " c o m e " and " g o .

Thompson, EG, 11. 23 T h e t w o terms seem to be employed here often as a compound of the type used with amelu·, cf. above, note 1 9 .

He filled in the pits that [I] had dug, He tore up my traps [which I had set], The beasts and creatures [of the steppe] He has made slip through my hands. He does not allow me to engage in fieldcraft!" Gilgamesh says to him, [to] the hunter: (40) "Go, my hunter, take with thee a harlot-lass. When he waters the beasts at the watering-place, She shall pull off her clothing, laying bare her ripeness. As soon as he sees her, he will draw near to her. Reject him will his beasts that grew up on his steppe!" Forth went the hunter, taking with him a harlot-lass. They took the road, going straight on the(ir) way. On the third day at the appointed spot they arrived. The hunter and the harlot sat down in their places. One day, a second day, they sat by the
watering-place. (50) The wild beasts came to the watering-place to drink.

The creeping creatures came, their heart delighting in water. But as for him, Enkidu, born in the hillsWith the gazelles he feeds on grass, With the wild beasts he drinks at the watering-place, With the creeping creatures his heart delights in waterThe lass beheld him, the savage-man,28 The barbarous fellow from the depths of the steppe: "There he is, Ο lass! Free thy breasts, Bare thy bosom that he may possess thy ripeness! Be not bashful! Welcome his ardor !2e (10) As soon as he sees thee, he will draw near to thee. Lay aside2®* thy cloth that he may rest upon thee. Treat him, the savage, to a woman's task! Reject him will his wild beasts that grew up on his steppe, As his love is drawn unto thee."27 The lass freed her breasts, bared her bosom, And he possessed her ripeness. She was not bashful as-she welcomed his ardor. She laid aside her cloth and he rested upon her. She treated him, the savage, to a woman's task, As his love was drawn unto her. (20)
For six days and seven nights Enkidu comes forth, Mating with the lass. After he had had (his) fill of her charms, He set his face toward his wild beasts. On seeing him, Enkidu, the gazelles ran off,

The wild beasts of the steppe drew away from his body. Starded was Enkidu, as his body became taut, His knees were motionless—for his wild beasts had gone. Enkidu had to slacken his pace—it was not as before; But he now had [wi]sdom, [br]oader understanding.28 Returning, he sits at the feet of the harlot. (30) He looks up at the face of the harlot, His ears attentive, as the harlot speaks; [The harlot] says to him, to Enkidu: ' T h o u art [wi]se,29 Enkidu, art become like a god! Why with the wild creatures dost thou roam over the steppe? Come, let me lead thee [to] ramparted Uruk, To the holy temple, abode of Anu and Ishtar, Where lives Gilgamesh, accomplished in strength, And like a wild ox lords it over the folk." As she speaks to him, her words find favor, (40) His heart enlightened,80 he yearns for81 a friend.

Tablet II
OLD BABYLONIAN VERSION
In the Assyrian Version, Tablet II has come down in only a few disjointed and mutilated fragments. The text here followed (in agreement with Bohl and Heidel) is that of the Old Babylonian Version as found on the "Pennsylvania Tablet." It was published by S. Langdon in UM, x, 3 (1917), and was revised in transliteration by M. Jastrow and A. T. Clay; cf. their An Old Babylonian Version of the Gilgamesh Epic (1920; abbr. YOS, rv, 3), 62-68. cf. also GETh, 20-24. The beginning of this tablet goes back to Tablet I, v, 25 of the Assyrian Version. The resulting repetition of some of the incidents should not prove to be unduly disturbing in an epic, particularly since the two accounts are by no means identical. It will be noted that many of the lines on the present tablet contain only two beats, an arrangement which affects the line count but does not alter the meter.
(i) Gilgamesh arose to reveal the dream, Saying to his mother; "My mother, in the time of night I felt joyful and I walked about In the midst of the nobles. The stars assembled89 in the heavens. The handiwork89 of Anu descended towards me. I sought to lift it; it was too heavy for me! I sought to move it; move it I could not! (10) Uruk-land was gathered about it, While the nobles kissed its feet. As I set my forehead,40 They gave me support. I raised it and brought it to thee." The mother of Gilgamesh, who knows all, Says to Gilgamesh: "Forsooth,41 Gilgamesh, one like thee Was born on the steppe, And the hills have reared him. When thou seest him, [as (over) a woman] thou wilt rejoice. (20) The nobles will kiss his feet; Thou wilt embrace him and [ . . ] . him; Thou wilt lead him to me." He lay down and saw another [He] arose and said to his mother: [My mother], I saw another [ . . . ] in the confusion,42 In the street [Of] broad-marted Uruk

There lay an axe, and
They were gathered round it. (30) That axe, strange was its shape.
As soon as I saw it, I rejoiced.
I loved it, and as though to a woman,
I was drawn48 to it.
I took it and placed it
At my side." The mother of Gilgamesh, who knows all,
[Says to Gilgamesh]:

"Because I made it vie with thee."
While Gilgamesh reveals his dream,
Enkidu sits before the harlot.
The two of them44 make love together.
He forgot the s[step]pe where he was born.
For six days and seven nights Enkidu came forth
Mating with the l[ass].
Then the harlot opened her mouth,
Saying to Enkidu: (10)
"As I look at thee, Enkidu, thou art become like a god;
Wherefore with the wild creatures
Dost thou range over the steppe?
Up, I will lead thee
To broad-marted Uruk,45
To the holy temple, the abode of Anu,
Enkidu, arise, I will lead thee To Eanna, the abode of Anu, Where lives [Gilgamesh, accomplished] in deeds,
And thou, li[ke... ], (20)
Wilt love [him like] thyself.
Up, arise from the ground,
The shepherd's bed!"
He hearkened to her words, approved46 her speech;
The woman's counsel
Fell upon his heart.
She pulled off (her) clothing;
With one (piece) she clothed him,
With the other garment
She clothed herself. (30)
Holding on to his hand,
She leads him like a child47

Food they placed before him;
He gagged, he gaped
And he stared.
Nothing does Enkidu know
Of eating food;
To drink strong drink
He has not been taught. The harlot opened her mouth, (10)
Saying to Enkidu:
"Eat the food, Enkidu,
As is life's due; Drink the strong drink, as is the custom of the land."
Enkidu ate the food,
Until he was sated;
Of strong drink he drank
Seven goblets. Carefree became his mood (and) cheerful,
His heart exulted (20)
And his face glowed.
He rubbed [the shaggy growth],49 The hair of his body, Anointed himself with oil,
Became human.
He put on clothing,
He is like a groom!
He took his weapon
To chase the lions,

Tablet 111
OLD BABYLONIAN VERSION
In the Assyrian Version, this tablet is extant only in fragments, which will be translated below, under B. The older text is that of the "Yale Tablet" (YOS, iv, 3, Pis. 1-7), which continues the account of the "Pennsylvania Tablet."
(i) (Mutilated or missing. Gilgamesh has decided on an expedition against monstrous Huwawa [Assyrian Humbaba], who resides in the Cedar Forest. Enkidu tries to dissuade him, but is unsuccessful, as may be gathered from the following verses.)
"[Why] dost thou desire (13) To do [this thing] ?"

62 For this idiom cf. Schott, ZA, XLII ( 1 9 3 4 ) , 107. 63 The noun ta-ab-bi-a-tum is generally derived from tappu and taken to refer, in the sense of "female companions," to "Enkidu's sorrow at the loss of his Love"; cf. Thompson, EG, 20. T h e context, however, would seem to favor Schott's derivation as based on nubbii "to wail," loc. cit., 107. 64 Lit. "has bound my neck veins." 65 Restored (with Schott, loc. cit., 108) from Assyrian Version, III, ii, 1718.

To safeguard [the Cedar Forest], As a terror to [mortals67 has Enlil appointed him]."
(Here fits in the fragment of the Assyrian Version, II, v, published in GETh, PI. x, top. Line 4 of this text is restored from a Neo-Babylonian fragment published by A. Heidel, JNESy xi (1952), 140-43.
"To safeguard the Cedar Forest, As a terror to mortals has Enlil appointed him. Humbaba—his roaring is the storm-flood, His mouth is fire, his breath is death! At sixty leagues he can hear the wild cows of the forest; Who is there that would go down to his Forest ? To safeguard the cedars, As a terror to mortals has Enlil appointed him; Weakness lays hold on him who goes down to the forest."
(the Old Babylonian Version continues)
Gilgamesh opened his mouth, (3) Saying to [Enkidu]: "Who, my friend can scale hefaven] ? Only the gods [live] forever under the sun. As for mankind, numbered are their days; Whatever they achieve is but the wind! Even here thou art afraid of death. What of thy heroic might ?

Gilgamesh kneels down [before Shamash], The words which he speaks [ . . . ] : "I go, O Shamash, my hands [raised up in prayer]. May it henceforth be well with my soul.

ASSYWAN VERSION: Tablet III
The beginning of this section links up with column vi 19 of the preceding so that there is only a slight overlap.
(i) [The elders opened their mouths, saying to Gilgamesh]: "Trust not, Gilgamesh, in all thine own strength. Let thine [eyes] be sated;74 make trust [worthy] thy stroke. He who goes in front saves the companion; He who knows the path protects his friend. Let Enkidu go in front of thee. He knows the way to the Cedar Forest, He has seen battle, is versed in combat. Enkidu shall protect the friend, safeguard the companion. Over the pitfalls he shall carry his body! (10) We, the Assembly, entrust the King to thee. Deliver thou back the King unto us!" Gilgamesh opened his mouth to speak, Saying to Enkidu: "Up, my friend, let us go to Egalmah,75 To the presence of Ninsun, the great Queen. Ninsun, the wise, who is versed in all knowledge, Will lend reasoned steps to our feet." Grasping each other, hand in hand, Gilgamesh and Enkidu go to Egalmah, (20) To the presence of Ninsun, the great Queen. Gilgamesh came forward as he entered [the palace]: "O Ninsun, I ma\e bold76 [... ]
A far journey, to the pl[ace of Humbaba]. An uncertain batde" [I am about to face], An uncertain [road I am about to travel]. [Until the day that I go and return], [Until I reach the Cedar Forest], [And banish from the land all evil, hateful to Shamash], [Pray thou to Shamash on my behalf]!"

And now thou didst affect him to go On a far journey, to the place of Humbaba, To face an uncertain battle, To travel an uncertain road!

Tablet IV
For this tablet, and for several of the following, the sequence of the extant texts is at times uncertain since the context must be pieced together from scattered Assyrian fragments and from such additions as have come to light elsewhere, particularly at Bogazkoy (in Hittite as well as in Akkadian). The arrangement here followed has been adopted from A. Schott, cf. ZA, XLII (1934), 113 ff. No existing fragments can be assigned with certainty to any of the first columns of the Assyrian Version. A small portion of the missing record of the journey to the Cedar Forest is preserved on a fragment from Uruk, published by A.

[He] who was born on the st[eppe... ], Enkidu, said to his friend, [explaining] the dr[eam]: "My friend, favorable is [thy] dream, The dream is most precious [ . . . ] . The mountain, my friend, which thou sawest, [is Humbaba]. (40) [We] shall seize Humbaba, sh[all kill him], [And shall cast] his corpse on the plain. On the morrow [ . . . ] . " At twenty leagues they br[oke off a morsel]; At thirty (further) leagues they prepared [for the night]. Before Shamash they dug a well [ . . . ]. Gilgamesh went up to [the mountain], His fine-meal he offered up [ . . . ]: "Mountain, bring me a dream [ . . . ] , Furnish for him [ . . . ] ! " (50)
(iv)
[The mountain] brought a dr[eam for Enkidu], It furnished for him [ . . . ] . , A cold shower passed over [ . . . ] ; It made him lie down [ . . . ] , [ . . . ] and like mountain barley [ . . . ] . [Gil]gamesh plants his chin on his knees. Sleep, which is shed on mankind, fell on him. In the middle watch he ended his sleep. He started up, saying to his friend: "My friend, didst thou not call me? W h y am I awake? (10) Didst thou not touch me ? W h y am I startled ? Did not some god go by ? W h y is my flesh numb ? My friend, I saw a third dream, And the dream that I saw was wholly awesome! The heavens shrieked, the earth boomed, [Day]light failed, darkness came. Lightning flashed, a flame shot up, [Theclouds] swelled, it rained death! Then the glow90 [vanished], the fire went out, [And all that] had fallen was turned to ashes. (20) Let us go down! Outside91 we can take counsel." [When] Enkidu [heard]02 the dream he had brought him, He said to Gilgamesh.
(Enkidu's reply is lost. The subsequent break in the Assyrian version is made up in part by the Hittite recension; cf. J. Friedrich, ZAS xxxix [1929], 8 ff.)
[Gilgamesh] seized [the axe in (his) hand] [ . . . and] felled [the cedar].
[But when Huwawa] heard the noise,
[He] became angry: " W h o has [come], (10) [Has slighted the trees, which] had been grown in my mountains, And has felled the cedar ?"
90 For ni-bu-tu, cf. ibid., 120.
91 This idiomatic sense appears to be more suitable here than "steppe." 82 Supplying [i!-me-m]a, with Schott, loc. cit., 120.
[Then] down from heaven spoke to them Heavenly Shamash: "Draw near, Fear you not, and [ . . . ] March, as long [as... ] Into (his) house he does not [enter . . . ]."
(Remainder of fragment mutilated. A further fragment implies that things had not gone well with the two friends, for)
His tears [came down in] streams. (6) And Gilgamesh [said] to heavenly Shamash:
(two lines fragmentary and obscure)
"But I have [come] to heavenly Shamash (10) And have taken the road assigned [ . . . ] . " Heavenly Shamash hearkened to the prayer of Gilgamesh; And against Huwawa mighty winds Rise up: the great wind, the north wind, [ . . . ] , The storm wind, the chill wind, the tem[pestuous] wind, The hot wind; eight winds rose up against him and Beat against the eyes [of Huwawa]. And he is unable to move forward, Nor is he able to move back. Then Huwawa let up. (20)
Thereupon Huwawa replied to Gilgamesh: "Let me go, Gilgamesh; thou [wilt be] my [master], And I shall be thy servant. And of [the trees] Which I have grown, I shall [ . . . ] Strong...[...] Cut down and houses [ . . . ] . " But Enkidu [said] to [Gilgamesh]: " T o the word which Huwawa [has spoken] H[ark] not [ . . . ] Let not Huwawa [ . . . ] . "
(The sequel seems to be found in the mutilated Assyrian fragment, GETh, PI. 19, which ends [line 47] with these words:)
[ . . . ] the head of Humba[ba they cut down . . . ].
Tablet VI
H e " washed his grimy hair, polished his weapons, The braid of his hair he shook out against his back. He cast off his soiled (things), put on his clean ones, Wrapped a fringed cloak about and fastened a sash. When Gilgamesh had put on his tiara, Glorious Ishtar raised an eye at the beauty of Gilgamesh: "Come, Gilgamesh, be thou (my) lover! Do but grant me of thy fruit. Thou shalt be my husband and I will be thy wife. I will harness for thee a chariot of lapis and gold, (10) Whose wheels are gold and whose horns are brass.94

Thou shalt have storm-demons to hitch on for mighty mules. In the fragrance of cedars thou shalt enter our house. When our house thou enterest, Threshold (and) dais shall kiss thy feet! Humbled before thee shall be kings, lords, and princes! The yield of hills and plain they shall bring thee as tribute. Thy goats shall cast triplets, thy sheep twins, Thy he-ass in lading shall surpass thy mule. Thy chariot horses shall be famed for racing, (20) [Thine ox] under yoke shall not have a rival!"
[Gilgamesh] opened his mouth to speak, [Saying] to glorious Ishtar: ["What am I to give] thee, that I may take thee in marriage? [Should I give oil] for the body, and clothing? [Should I give] bread and victuals? [ . . . ] food fit for divinity, [ . . . ] drink fit for royalty.

For Tammuz, the lover of thy youth, Thou hast ordained wailing year after year. Having loved the dappled shepherd-bird, Thou smotest him, breaking his wing. In the grooves he sits,100 crying 'My wing !'101 (50) Then thou lovedst a lion, perfect in strength; Seven pits and seven thou didst dig for him. Then a stallion thou lovedst, famed in battle; The whip, the spur, and the lash thou ordainedst for him. Thou decreedst for him to gallop seven leagues,

Thou decreedst for him the muddied to drink;102 For his mother, Silili, thou ordainedst wailing! Then thou lovedst the keeper of the herd, Who ash-cakes ever did heap up for thee, Daily slaughtered kids for thee; (60) Yet thou smotest him, turning him into a wolf, So that his own herd boys drive him off, And his dogs bite his thighs.108 Then thou lovedst Ishullanu, thy father's gardener, Who baskets of dates ever did bring to thee, And daily did brighten thy table. Thine eyes raised at him, thou didst go to him: 'O my Ishullanu, let us taste of thy vigor! Put forth thy "hand" and touch our "modesty!" '104 Ishullanu said to thee: (70)
W h a t dost thou want with me? Has my mother not baked, have I not eaten, That I should taste the food of stench and foulness?108 Does reed-work afford cover against the cold ?'108 As thou didst hear this [his talk], Thou smotest him and turn[edst] him into a mole. Thou placedst him in the midst o f . . [. ] ; He cannot go u p . . . nor can he come down .. .10T If thou shouldst love me, thou wouldst [treat me] like them."
When Ishtar heard this, Ishtar was enraged and [mounted] to heaven. (80) Forth went Ishtar to w[eep] before Anu, her father, Her tea[rs] flow in the presence of An turn, her mother: "My father, Gilgamesh has heaped insults upon me! Gilgamesh has recounted my stinking deeds, My stench and my foulness." Anu opened his mouth to speak, Saying to glorious Ishtar: "Art thou the father ? Didst thou not quarrel with king Gilgamesh ? And so Gilgamesh has recounted thy stinking deeds, Thy stench and [thy] foulness." (91) Ishtar opened her mouth to speak, Saying to A[nu], her father: "My father, please give me the Bull of Heaven that he smite [king] Gilgamesh . . . in his home. [And] fill Gil[gamesh . . . ] ! If thou [dost not] give me [the Bull of Heaven], I will smash [the doors of the nether world],108 I will pla[ce those above] below,
I will raise up the dead eating (and) alive, So that the dead shall outnumber the living!" (100) Anu opened his mouth [to speak], I will raise up the dead eating (and) alive, So that the dead shall outnumber the living!" (100) Anu opened his mouth [to speak],

Hast thou gathered [grain against the (years of barren)] husks? Hast thou grown grass [for the beasts] ?" [Ishtar opened her mouth] to speak, [Saying to A]nu, her father: "[Grain for the people] I have stored, [Grass for the beasts] I have provided.

Enkidu opened his mouth to speak, Saying [to Gilgamesh]: "My friend, we have gloried [ . . . ] . "
(Lines 135-49 mutilated, but the course of the batde is made plain by the following:)
Between neck and horns [he thrust] his sword. (150) When they had slain the Bull, they tore out his heart, Placing it before Shamash. They drew back and did homage before Shamash. The two brothers sat down.
Then Ishtar mounted the wall of ramparted Uruk, Sprang on the batdements, uttering a curse: "Woe unto Gilgamesh because he insulted me111 By slaying the Bull of Heaven!" When Enkidu heard this speech of Ishtar, He threw the right thigh of the Bull of Heaven, Tossing it in her face: "Could I but get thee, like unto him. (160) I would do unto thee. His entrails I would hang at thy side!" (Thereupon) Ishtar assembled the votaries, The (pleasure-) lasses and the (temple-)harlots. Over the right thigh of the Bull of Heaven she set up a wail. But Gilgamesh called the craftsmen, the armorers, All (of them).

Comparison with Arab, tfi "litde" may be suggested in further support.
The artisans admire the thickness of his112 horns: Each is cast from thirty minas of lapis; The coating118 on each is two fingers (thick); (170) Six measures114 of oil, the capacity of the two, He offered as ointment to his god, Lugalbanda. He brought (them) and hung them in his princely bedchamber.115
In the Euphrates they washed their hands, They embraced each other as they went on, Riding through the market-street of Uruk. The people of Uruk are gathered to gaze [upon them]. Gilgamesh to the lyre maids118 [of Uruk] Says (these) words: "Who is most splendid among the heroes ? (180) Who is most glorious among men ?"

Gilgamesh in his palace holds a celebration. Down he the heroes on their beds of night. Also Enkidu lies down, a dream beholding. Up rose Enkidu to relate his dream, (190) Saying to his friend: "My friend, why are the great gods in council ?»117
Tablet VII
The first two columns of this tablet are missing in the Assyrian Version. Enkidu's dream, however, is the subject of KUB, VIII, 48, and this Hittite text has been dealt with by I- Friedrich in ZA, xxxix (1929), 16-19. See p. 505.
" [ . . . ] . . . Then daylight came." [And] Enkidu answered Gilgamesh: "[He]ar the dream which I had last night: Anu, Enlil, Ea, and heavenly Shamash [Were in council]. And Anu said to Enlil: 'Because the Bull of Heaven they have slain, and Huwawa They have slain, therefore'—said Anu—'the one of them W h o stripped the mountains of the cedar [Must die!]' But Enlil said: 'Enkidu must die; Gilgamesh, however, shall not die!'

Landsberger, MAOG, rv (1928/29), 299, n.2. 1 1 6 The context calls clearly for musicians or singers, not servant girls; hence neither fuppulu (cf. n . m ) nor tabalu can underlie the present term. However, Heb. nebel "psaltery" suggests an excellent semantic and morphological background. 1 1 7 Catch-line of the following tablet. 1 1 8 Text "thy." See, however, Schott, GE, 45, n . i .

That they slew the Bull of Heaven and Huwawa ? Should now innocent Enkidu die ?' But Enlil turned In anger to heavenly Shamash: 'Because, much Ufa One of their119 comrades, thou didst daily go down to them.'" Enkidu lay down (ill) before Gilgamesh. And as his120 tears were streaming down, (he said): "O my brother, my dear brother! Me they would Clear at the expense of my brother!" Furthermore: (20) "Must I by the spirit (of the dead) Sit down, at the spirit's door, Never again [to behold] my dear brother with (mine) eyes?"
(The remainder is lost. In a deathbed review of his life, Enkidu seems to bemoan the events that had led up to this sorry state, cursing the successive steps in his fated life. One of his curses, preserved in an Assyrian fragment,121 is directed against the gate that lamed his hand.)
Enkidu [ . . . ] lifted up [his eyes], (36) Speaking with the door as though [it were human]: "Thou door of the woods, uncomprehending], Not endowed with understanding! At twenty leagues away I found choice thy wood, (40) (Long) before I beheld the lofty cedar. There is no counterpart of thy wood [in the land]. Six dozen cubits is thy height, two dozen thy breadth [...]. Thy pole, thy pole-ferrule, and thy pole-knob122 [ . . . ] . A master-craftsman in Nippur built thee [ . . . ] . Had I known, O door, that this [would come to pass] And that this [thy] beauty [ . . . ] , I would have lifted the axe, would have [ . . . ] , I would have set a reed frame upon [thee] !"123

Destroy his wealth,124 diminish his power! May his [way be repugnant] before thee. May [the beasts he would trap] escape from before him. [Let not] the hunter at[tain] the fullness of his heart!"

Because me [thou h a s t . . . ] And because [ . . . ] upon me." When Shamash heard [these words] of his mouth, Forthwith he called down to him [from] heaven: "Why, O Enkidu, cursest thou the harlot-lass, W h o made thee eat food fit for divinity, And gave thee to drink wine fit for royalty, W h o clothed thee with noble garments, And made thee have fair Gilgamesh for a comrade ?

Looking at me, he leads me to the House of Darkness, The abode of Irkalla, To the house which none leave who have entered it, On the road from which there is no way back, To the house wherein the dwellers are bereft of light, Where dust is their fare and clay their food; They are clothed like birds, with wings for garments, And see no light, residing in darkness.181 In the House of Dust, which I entered, (40) I looked at [rulers], their crowns put away; I [saw princes], those (born to) the crown, Who had ruled the land from the days of yore. [These doubl]es182 of Anu and Enlil were serving meat roasts; They were serving bake [meats] and pouring Cool water from the waterskins. In the House of Dust, which I entered, Reside High Priest and acolyte, Reside incantatory and ecstatic, Reside the laver-anointers of the great gods, Resides Etana,138 resides Sumuqan.184 Ereshkigal [lives there], Queen of the nether world, (50) [And Belit-]Seri, recorder of the nether world, kneels before her.

For Enkidu, his friend, Gilgamesh Weeps bitterly, as he ranges over the steppe: "When I die, shall I not be like Enkidu ? Woe has entered my belly. Fearing death, I roam over the steppe. To Utnapishtim,148 Ubar-Tutu's144 son, I have taken the road to proceed in all haste. When arriving by night at mountain passes, I saw lions and grew afraid, I lifted my head to Sin145 to pray. (10) To [. .. ] of the gods went out my orisons. [ . . . ] preserve thou me!"

When [he arrived] at the mountain range146 of Mashu, Which daily keeps watch over sun [rise and sunset]Whose peaks147 [reach to] the vault of heaven (And) whose breasts reach to the nether world belowScorpion-men guard its gate, Whose terror is awesome and whose glance was death. Their shimmering148 halo sweeps the mountains That at sunrise and sunset keep watch over the sun. When Gilgamesh beheld them, with fear (10) And terror was darkened his face. Regaining149 his composure, he approached them. A scorpion-man calls to his wife: "He who has come to us—his body is the flesh of the gods!" His wife answers the scorpion-man: "Two-thirds of him is god, one-third of him is human." [The scorpi]on-man calls to the fellow, Addressing (these) words [to the offspring] of the gods: "[Why hast thou come on this] far journey? [Why hast thou arrived] before me, (20) [Traversing seas]150 whose crossings are difficult? [The purpose of thy com]ing I would learn."

X (Old Babylonian Version), iv, n, In favor of this direction may be citied the fact that the ale-wife Siduri, whom Gilgamesh encounters in the course of his present journey, is a Hurrian term for "young woman" used to describe ijebat, a form of Ishtar in the Hurrian texts; cf. e.g. KUB, xxvn, 38, iv, 8; 42; obv. 23.

Tablet X
This tablet, which traces further the successive stages in Gilgamesh's quest of immortality, happens to be represented by as many as four separate versions. Two of these, however, the Hittite (cf. ZA, xxxix [1929], 20 £F.) and the Hurrian (cf. ZA, xxxv [1924], 133 ff.), are extant only in fragments that are too slight for connected translation. Substantial portions are available, on the other hand, in the Old Babylonian and Assyrian recensions. The Old Babylonian material was published by B. Meissner, MVAG, VH (1902).

Since the days of yore there has been no permanence; The resting and the dead, how alike they are! Do they not compose181 a picture of death, The commoner and the noble, Once they are near to [their fate] ? The Anunnaki, the great gods, foregather; Mammetum, maker of fate, with them the fate decrees: Death and life they determine. (But) of death, its days are not revealed."
Tablet XI
Gilgamesh said to him, to Utnapishtim the Faraway: "As I look upon thee, Utnapishtim, Thy features are not strange; even as I art thou. Thou art not strange at all; even as I art thou. My heart had regarded thee as resolved182 to do batde, [Yet] thou liest indolent upon thy back! [Tell me,] how joinedst thou the Assembly of the gods, In thy quest of life ?"
Utnapishtim said to him, to Gilgamesh: "I will reveal to thee, Gilgamesh, a hidden matter And a secret of the gods will I tell thee: (10) Shurippak—a city which thou knowest, [(And) which on Euphrates' [banks] is situateThat city was ancient, (as were) the gods within it, When their heart led the great gods to produce the flood. [There] were Anu, their father, Valiant Enlil, their counselor, Ninurta, their assistant, Ennuge, their irrigator.188 Ninigiku-Ea was also present with them; Their words he repeats to the reed-hut :184 (20) 'Reed-hut, reed-hut! Wall, wall! Reed-hut, hearken! Wall, reflect! Man of Shuruppak,185 son of Ubar-Tutu, Tear down (this) house, build a ship! Give up possessions, seek thou life. Forswear (worldly) goods and keep the soul alive! Aboard the ship take thou the seed of all living things. The ship that thou shalt build, Her186 dimensions shall be to measure. Equal shall be her width and her length. (30) Like the Apsu thou shalt ceil her.'187 I understood, and I said to Ea, my lord: '[Behold], my lord, what thou hast thus ordered, I will be honored to carry out. [But what] shall I answer the city, the people and elders?'188

Ea opened his mouth to speak, Saying to me, his servant: "Thou shalt then thus speak unto them: "I have learned that Enlil is hostile to me, So that I cannot reside in your city, (40) Nor set my f [00] t in Enlil's territory. To the Deep I will therefore go down, To dwell with my lord Ea. [But upon] you he will shower down abundance, [The choicest] birds, the rarest** fishes.
[The land shall have its fill] of harvest riches. [He who at dusk orders] the husk-greens, Will shower down upon you a rain of wheat" '19°
With the first glow of dawn, The land was gathered [about me]. (too fragmentary for translation) (50-53) The litde ones [carr]ied bitumen, While the grown ones brought [all else] that was needful. On the fifth day I laid her framework. One (whole) acre191 was her floor space,192 Ten dozen cubits the height of each of her walls, Ten dozen cubits each edge of the square deck.198 I laid out the contours (and) joined her together.194 I provided her with six decks, (60) Dividing her (thus) into seven parts. Her floor plan I divided into nine parts. I hammered water-plugs into her.198 I saw to the punting-poles and laid in supplies.198 Six 'sar' (measures)197 of bitumen I poured into the furnace, Three sar of asphalt [I also] poured inside. Three sar of oil the basket-bearers carried, Aside from the one sar of oil which the calling198 consumed, And the two sar of oil [which] the boatman stowed away. Bullocks I slaughtered for the [people], (70) And I killed sheep every day. Must, red wine, oil, and white wine199 [I gave the] workmen [to drink], as though river water, That they might feast as on New Year's Day. I op[ened . . . ] ointment, applying (it) to my hand.
1 8 9 1 take these genitive forms to denote the superlative, in accordance with Semitic usage. The literal sense would be " [ A choice o f ] birds, a hiding of fishes." 1 9 0 Restored from lines 87, 90. As has long been recognized, these lines feature word plays in that both ku\ku and kibati may designate either food or misfortune; cf. C. Frank, ZA, x x x v i ( 1 9 3 5 ) , 218. Wily Ea plays on this ambiguity: To the populace, the statement would be a promise of prosperity; to Utnapishtim it would signalize the impending deluge. 1»1 cf. Heidel, EG, 82, n.170. 1 9 2 Schott and Landsberger, ZA, XLII ( 1 9 3 4 ) , 137. 1 9 3 T h e ship was thus an exact cube, cf. Heidel, EG, 82, n.173. 1 9 4 Or "fashioned." "Contours," lit.

[On the sev]enth [day] the ship was completed. [The launching] was very difficult, So that they had to shift the floor planks200 above and below,
[Until] two-thirds of [the structure]201 [had g]one [into the water].
[Whatever I had] I laded upon her: (80) Whatever I had of silver I laded upon her; Whatever I [had] of gold I laded upon her; Whatever I had of all the living beings I [laded] upon her. All my family and kin I made go aboard the ship. The beasts of the field, the wild creatures of the field, All the craftsmen I made go aboard. Shamash had set for me a stated time: 'When he who orders unease at night,202 Will shower down a rain of blight, Board thou the ship and batten up the entrance!' That stated time had arrived: 'He who orders unease at night, showers down a rain of blight.' (90) I watched the appearance of the weather. The weather was awesome to behold. I boarded the ship and battened up the entrance. To batten down208 the (whole) ship, to Puzur-Amurri, the boatman, I handed over the structure together with its contents.
With the first glow of dawn, A black cloud rose up from the horizon. Inside it Adad thunders, While Shullat and Hanish204 go in front, Moving as heralds over hill and plain. (100) Erragal205 tears out the posts;206 Forth comes Ninurta and causes the dikes to follow. The Anunnaki lift up the torches, Setting the land ablaze with their glare. Consternation207 over Adad reaches to the heavens, Who turned to blackness all that had been light. [The wide] land was shattered like [a pot]! For one day the south-storm [blew], Gathering speed as it blew, [submerging the mountains], Overtaking the [people] like a batde. ( n o ) No one can see his fellow, Nor can the people be recognized from heaven.
2 0 0 Read ge-er-md-dit, with Salonen, op. cit., 93. I take the sense to be, however, that the weight had to be shifted around (uitabbalu) on the upper and lower decks (elil u laplii) to make the launching possible. 2 0 1 Because of the masculine suffix (iinipat-su), the antecedent cannot be the feminine eleppu "ship." Perhaps ekfdlu, as in line 95. 202 x i , c true bearing of the word plays mentioned in lines 46-47. In order to reflect the rhyme of the Akkadian, which the two halves of this line contain—perhaps to bring out the proverbial content—I have translated here Ulati as "night," instead of "evening, dusk." 2 0 8 L i t "to calk," cf. Salonen, op. cit., 152. This expression seems to mean here "to put the finishing touches to." 2 0 4 For this reading of the names of the two heralds cf.

The gods were frightened by the deluge, And, shrinking back, they ascended to the heaven of Anu.208 The gods cowered like dogs Crouched against the outer wall. Ishtar cried out like a woman in travail, The sweet-voiced mistress of the [gods] moans aloud: 'The olden days are alas turned to clay, Because I bespoke evil in the Assembly of the gods. How could I bespeak evil in the Assembly of the gods, (120) Ordering batde for the destruction of my people, When it is I myself who give birth to my people! Like the spawn of the fishes they fill the sea!' The Anunnaki gods weep with her, The gods, all humbled, sit and weep, Their lips drawn tight,209 [ . . . ] one and all. Six days and [six] nights Blows the flood wind, as the south-storm sweeps the land. When the seventh day arrived, The flood (-carrying) south-storm subsided in the batde, Which it had fought like an army. (130) The sea grew quiet, the tempest was still, the flood ceased. I looked at the weather: stillness had set in, And all of mankind had returned to clay. The landscape was as level as a flat roof. I opened a hatch, and light fell upon my face. Bowing low, I sat and wept, Tears running down on my face. I looked about for coast lines in the expanse of the sea: In each of fourteen210 (regions) There emerged a region(-mountain).211 On Mount Nisir212 the ship came to a halt. (140) Mount Nisir held the ship fast, Allowing no motion. One day, a second day, Mount Nisir held the ship fast, Allowing no motion. A third day, a fourth day, Mount Nisir held the ship fast, Allowing no motion. A fifth, and a sixth (day), Mount Nisir held the ship fast, Allowing no motion.
When the seventh day arrived, I sent forth and set free a dove. The dove went forth, but came back; Since no resting-place for it was visible, she turned round. Then I sent forth and set free a swallow.

The swallow went forth, but came back; (150) Since no resting-place for it was visible,212* she turned round. Then I sent forth and set free a raven. The raven went forth and, seeing that the waters had diminished, He eats, circles, caws, and turns not round. Then I let out (all) to the four winds And offered a sacrifice. I poured out a libation on the top of the mountain. Seven and seven cult-vessels I set up, Upon their pot-stands I heaped cane, cedarwood, and
myrtle. The gods smelled the savor, The gods smelled the sweet savor, (160) The gods crowded like flies about the sacrificer. When at length as the great goddess"' arrived, She lifted up the great jewels which Anu had fashioned to her liking: 'Ye gods here, as surely as this lapis Upon my neck I shall not forget, I shall be mindful of these days, forgetting (them) never. Let the gods come to the offering; (But) let not Enlil come to the offering, For he, unreasoning, brought on the deluge And my people consigned to destruction.' When at length as Enlil arrived, (170) And saw the ship, Enlil was wroth, He was filled with wrath over the Igigi gods:214 'Has some living soul escaped ? No man was to survive the destruction!' Ninurta opened his mouth to speak, Saying to valiant Enlil: 'Who, other than Ea, can devise plans ?215 It is Ea alone who knows every matter.' Ea opened his mouth to speak, Saying to valiant Enlil: 'Thou wisest of gods, thou hero, How couldst thou, unreasoning, bring on the deluge ? On the sinner impose his sin, (180) On the transgressor impose his transgression! (Yet) be lenient, lest he be cut off, Be patient,216 lest he be dis[lodged]!

Now then take counsel in regard to him!' Thereupon Enlil went aboard the ship. Holding me by the hand, he took me aboard. (190) He took my wife aboard and made (her) kneel by my side. Standing between us, he touched our foreheads to bless us: 'Hitherto Utnapishtim has been but human. Henceforth Utnapishtim and his wife shall be like unto us gods. Utnapishtim shall reside far away, at the mouth of the rivers 1' Thus they took me and made me reside far away, At the mouth of the rivers.

As he sits there on his haunches, (200) Sleep fans him like the whirlwind. Utnapishtim says to her, to his spouse: "Behold this hero who seeks life! Sleep fans him like a mist." His spouse says to him, to Utnapishtim the Faraway: "Touch him that the man may awake, That he may return safe on the way whence he came, That through the gate by which he left he may return to his land." Utnapishtim says to her, to his spouse: "Since to deceive is human, he will seek to deceive thee.219 (210) Up, bake for him wafers, put (them) at his head, And mark on the wall the days he sleeps."

Let him wash off his grime in water clean as snow, (240) Let him cast off his skins, let the sea carry (them) away, That the fairness of his body may be seen.

They pulled him down into the deep [and he saw the plant]. He took the plant, though it pr[icked his hands]. He cut the heavy stones [from his feet]. The [s]ea225 cast him up upon its shore.
Gilgamesh says to him, to Urshanabi, the boatman: "Urshanabi, this plant is a plant apart,228 Whereby a man may regain his life's breath.

(300) After twenty leagues they broke off a morsel, After thirty (further) leagues they prepared for the night When they arrived in ramparted Uruk, Gilgamesh says to him, to Urshanabi, the boatman: "Go up, Urshanabi, walk on the ramparts of Uruk. Inspect the base terrace, examine its brickwork, If its brickwork is not of burnt brick, And if the Seven Wise Ones laid not its foundation!

Tablet XII
Contents and circumstantial evidence mark this tablet as an inorganic appendage to the epic proper. The basic theme is concluded with the hero's failure to attain his quest. Moreover, the last lines of Tablet XI are the same as the final lines of the introduction to the entire work (I, i, 16-19). Lasdy, Gadd (RA, xxxi [1933], 126 ff.) and Kramer J AOS, LXIV (1944)) 7 ff. have demonstrated that Tablet XII is a direct translation from the Sumerian; the remaining tablets—as pointed out by Kramergive every indication of creative borrowing and independent formulation. The Akkadian version of the present tablet is a translation of the second part of a Sumerian legend. The first part—disregarded by the Akkadian translator—is fortunately extant and has been published by Kramer in his monograph Gilgamesh and the Huluppu-Tree (1938). Since the beginning is essential as an introduction to Tablet XII, it may be summarized briefly, as follows:
Shortly after the creation of the universe, a tree growing on the bank of the Euphrates was uprooted by the south wind. Inanna (Ishtar) took the floating trunk and planted it in her garden in Uruk. She intended to use it, in due time, as timber for her bed and chair. When several hostile beings interfered with Inanna's plan, Gilgamesh came to her rescue. In gratitude, Inanna made from the base of the tree a pu\\u, probably a magic Drum, and from the crown a mi!(\u, apparendy a Drumstick of similar magic potency, and gave them both to Gilgamesh. One day both these precious objects fell into the nether world. Gilgamesh sought to retrieve them but could not. Lamenting his loss, he cried "O my puk\u, O my m i k k " " It is at this point that the Akkadian translation, known to us as Tablet XII, sets in, a fact witnessed by the catch-line at the end of Tablet XI. To Kramer {loc. cit., 22-23 and n.113) and to Gadd we owe the further recognition that the small fragment containing the beginning of the first eight lines in Thompson's edition ( G E T h , Pi. 55) is not part of the main portion of the tablet, but a duplicate (as shown, among other things, by the fact that no proper join has been made). What Thompson mistook for the beginning of the tablet is in reality line 4, corresponding to line 48 in Gadd's Sumerian text. Line 1 is, of course, given by the catchline. In the translation given below, restorations based on the Sumerian text will be indicated by square brackets. I had the opportunity to talk over the whole problem with Dr. Kramer and I have adopted from him several new observations which will be pointed out in the footnotes.

Creation of Man by the Mother Goddess
The basic theme of this myth is the creation of man out of clay mixed with the flesh and blood of a slain god. Unfortunately, the Old Babylonian text which deals with this subject ( A ) is incomplete and in a singularly poor state of preservation. Furthermore, the account came to be used as part of an incantation to facilitate childbirth, with the result that the myth itself seems to have been restated only in its bare oudines. It is too important, however, to be ignored, in spite of its lacunae and its uncertainties. The ritual part of this Old Babylonian text agrees closely with the concluding portion of the Assyrian Version of the Atrahasis Epic—a fact which was first recognized by E. Ebeling.1 Accordingly, the Assyrian analogue in question has been detached from the Atrahasis Epic—with which it has only an incidental connection—and has been appended in this place as Version B.

A Cosmological Incantation:
The Worm and the Toothache
Among the incantations which contain cosmological material, one of the best-known attributes toothache to a worm that had obtained the permission of the gods to dwell among the teeth and gums. The present text, which is designated ideographically as an "Incantation against Toothache," dates from Neo-Babylonian times and was published by R. Campbell Thompson in CT, XVII (1903), PI. 50. But the colophon indicates that the copy had been made from an ancient text. And indeed, the Man documents of the Old Babylonian period include a tablet with the Akkadian label ii-pa-at tu-td-Um "Toothache Incantation." The text itself, however,1 is in Hurrian. But although it cites various deities of the Hurrian pantheon—and is thus clearly religious in nature—the context does not correspond to the NeoBabylonian legend, to judge from the intelligible portions.

T h e story of Adapa* shares with the Epic of Gilgamesh the motif of man's squandered opportunity for gaining immortality. It is extant in four fragmentary accounts.

At that, Ea, he who knows what pertains to heaven, took hold of him, [Adapa], caused him to wear (his) [hai]r unkempt, a mourning garb [He made him put on], and gave him (this) [ad] vice: "[Adapa], thou art going [before Anu], the king; [The road to heaven thou wilt take.

(This) advice that I have given thee, neglect not; the words That I have spoken to thee, hold fast!" The messenger Of Anu arrived there (saying as follows): "Adapa the
south wind's Wing has broken, bring him before me!"
He made him take the road to heaven, and to heaven he went up. When he had ascended to heaven and approached the gate of Anu, Tammuz and Gizzida were standing at the gate of Anu. When they saw Adapa, they cried, "Mercy! (40) Man, for whom dost thou look thus ? Adapa, For whom art thou clad with mourning garb?" " T w o gods have disappeared from the land, therefore with mourning garb I am clad." "Who are the two gods who from the land have disappeared ?" "Tammuz and Gizzida." They glanced at each other And smiled.® As Adapa before Anu, the king, Drew near and Anu saw him, he called: "Come now, Adapa, wherefore the south wind's wing Didst thou break?" Adapa replied to Anu: "My lord, For the household of my master, in the midst of the sea (50) I was catching fish. The sea was like a mirror. But the south wind came blowing and submerged me, Causing (me) to go down to the home of the fish. In the wrath of my heart I cursed the [south wind]."

As for us, what shall we do about him ? Bread of life (60) Fetch for him and he shall eat (it)." When the bread of life They brought him, he did not eat; when the water of life They brought him, he did not drink. When a garment They brought him, he put (it) on; when oil They brought him, he anointed himself (therewith). As Anu looked at him, he laughed at him: "Come now, Adapa! Why didst thou neither eat nor drink?'"
8 Apparently pleased because Adapa mourned their loss. 7 For a suggested reading cf. Heidel, ad toe. 8 Lit. "heart."

Nergal and Ereshkigal
This Mesopotamian myth is so far known only from two fragments of a school text dating from the fourteenth century B.C. and unearthed at Tell El-Amarna, in Egypt. In antiquity the myth was evidently used to train the Egyptian foreign-language student in acquiring a knowledge of Akkadian, at that time the common cultural medium of the whole region. This secondary use, however, did not enhance the reliability of the text. Furthermore, the tablet has suffered badly since then, one fragment ( A ) now belonging to the British Museum (published by C. Bezold and E. A. Wallis Budge, The Tell El-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, 1892, No. 82), and the other (B) to the Berlin Museum (published by O. Schxoeder in VAS, XII [1915], No. 195). The basic study is that of J. A. Knudtzon, Die El-Amarna Tafeln (1915), 969 ff.; Knudtzon's line count has here been retained. For later translations cf. Ebeling, AOT, 210 ff. and Heidel, GE, 129 ff. See the Supplement, p. 507.
(obverse) Fragment A
When the gods were preparing a banquet, To their sister, Ereshkigal, They sent a messenger: "Whereas we can go down to thee, Thou canst not come up to us. Send up, therefore, that they take thy food-portion." Hence [Eresh]kigal sent Namtar, her vizier. N[amt]ar went up to lofty heaven. He enter[ed the place where the gods were conversing} They [ . . . and greeted] Namtar, (10) The messenger of their great [sister].
(Several lines mutilated or missing. It is clear, however, from what follows that Nergal, alone among the gods, failed to show the proper respect to the envoy of Ereshkigal. When this has been reported to her, she sends Namtar back.)

The gods hailed him to speak to him [ . . . ] : "Look and, as for the god who rose not before thee, (30) Take him to the presence of thy mistress." When Namtar counted them, a god in the rear was bald. "The god is not here who did not rise before me." [Off w]ent Namtar [to make] his [r]eport. " [ . . .

To the presence of thy mistress, Ereshkigal, I have been sent." Forth went the gatekeeper And said to Namtar: "A certain god is standing at the entrance of the gate. Come and inspect him that he may enter." Out went Namtar. When he saw him, rejoicing5 [ . . . ] he said To his [mis]tress: "My lady, [it is the god w]ho months A g o [dis]appeared, not having risen [before] me!" "Bring (him) in!

Inside the house he took hold of Ereshkigal, By her hair he brought her down from the throne To the ground, to cut off her head. "Kill me not, my brother! Let me speak a word to thee!" (80) When Nergal heard her, his hands relaxed. She weeps, humbled:6 "Be thou my husband and I will be thy wife. I will let thee hold Dominion over the wide nether world. I will place the tablet Of wisdom in thy hand. That shalt be master, I will be mistress!" When Nergal heard this her speech, He took hold of her and kissed her, wiping away her tears: "Whatever thou hast wished of me since months past, So be it now!"
Atrahasis
The name Atrahasis (Old Babylonian Atramhasis), i.e. "Exceeding Wise," is associated with more than one hero of the epic literature of Mesopotamia. The Epic of Gilgamesh (XI, 196) applies it to Utnapishtim, the hero of the Flood. The poems of Etana and Adapa make use of the same epithet. More specifically, however, the name is associated with a large epic cycle dealing with man's sins and his consequent punishment through plagues and the deluge. This cycle, which thus provides a parallel to the biblical motivation for the Flood, bore originally the name Enuma ilu awelum "When God, Man . . Today it is commonly known as the Atrahasis Epic. Fragments of this epic have come down to us in separate Old Babylonian and Assyrian recensions—as is also true of Gilgamesh. The Assyrian Version (Fragments C, D) dates from the time of Ashurbanipal. The Old Babylonian Version (Fragments A, B) is approximately a thousand years older, going back to the reign of Ammisaduqa, at which time it was copied from a still earlier text. Unfortunately, the extant material is but a small fraction of the original total. For according to the colophon on B, the Old Babylonian Version consisted of three tablets aggregating 1,245 lines, or about twenty times as many as are now available. The gaps in the Assyrian recension are only relatively less serious. The underlying relationship of all four pieces is assured by the joint evidence of phraseology, subject matter, and principal characters. Fragments of B and C, moreover, establish a direct connection with Gilgamesh, Tablet XI. For the sake of convenience, a further fragment of an Old Babylonian flood text has been included in the present group. It has been marked as Fragment X and given a place immediately after Fragment B. For the present it cannot be determined whether this fragment ever did form an integral part of the earliest version of the epic; it might well have done so. On the other hand, column iv of Fragment D has been omitted from this context and placed instead at the end of Creation of Man by the Mother Goddess (pp. 99f.), where it clearly belongs. The eventual displacement is due to the fact that the present epic came to be used in Assyrian times (if not earlier) as an incantation for childbirth, for which column iv was apparently regarded as the proper accompaniment. The source material is as follows: ( A ) A. T. Clay, YOS, v,

of the dead and her eventual return to the land of the living. The cuneiform material is extant in Sumerian and Akkadian formulations. The Sumerian version is obviously primary. But although the Semitic version has various points of contact with the older source, it is by no means a mere translation from the Sumerian, for which cf. Kramer, pp. 52-57. The Semitic version has come down to us in two recensions. The older of these ( A ) comes from Ashur.

Heidel, GE, 121 ff. The present translation is a composite one in that it makes use, in common with all the renderings subsequent to the publication of A, of both the Nineveh and the Ashur version. Where the difference between the two is more than stylistic, the recension here followed will be explicitly in
dicated.
(obverse) To the Land of no Return, the realm of [Ereshkigal], Ishtar, the daughter of Sin, [set] her mind.1 Yea, the daughter of Sin set [her] mind To the dark house, the abode of Irkal[la],2 To the house which none leave who have entered it, To the road from which there is no way back, To the house wherein the entrants are bereft of li[ght], Where dust is their fare and clay their food, (Where) they see no light, residing in darkness, (Where) they are clothed like birds, with wings for garments,8 (10) (And where) over door and bolt is spread dust.4 When Ishtar reached the gate of the Land of no Return, She said (these) words to the gatekeeper: "0 gatekeeper, open thy gate, Open thy gate that I may enter! If thou openest not the gate so that I cannot enter, I will smash the door, I will shatter the bolt, I will smash the doorpost, I will move the doors, I will raise up the dead, eating the living, So that the dead will outnumber the living."5 (20) The gatekeeper opened his mouth to speak, Saying to exalted Ishtar: "Stop, my lady, do not throw it8 down! I will go to announce thy name to Queen E[reshk]igal." The gatekeeper entered, saying [to] Eresh[kigal]: "Behold,7 thy sister Ishtar is waiting at [the gate], She who upholds8 the great festivals, Who stirs up the deep before Ea, the kfing]."9 When Ereshkigal heard this,

Lo, should I drink water with the Anunnaki ? Should I eat clay for bread, drink muddied water for beer? Should I bemoan the men who left their wives behind ? Should I bemoan the maidens who were wrenched from the laps of their lovers ? (Or) should I bemoan the tender little one who was sent off before his time ?12 Go, gatekeeper, open the gate for her, Treat her in accordance with the ancient rules." Forth went the gatekeeper (to) open the door for her: "Enter, my lady, that Cutha18 may rejoice over thee, (40) That the palace of the Land of no Return may be glad at thy presence." When the first door he had made her enter, He stripped" and took away the great crown on her head. "Why, O gatekeeper, didst thou take the great crown on my head?" "Enter, my lady, thus are the rules of the Mistress of the NetherWorld." When the second gate he had made her enter, He stripped and took away the pendants on her ears. "Why, O gatekeeper, didst thou take the pendants on my ears?" "Enter, my lady, thus are the rules of the Mistress of the NetherWorld."

As soon as Ishtar had descended to the Land of no Return, Ereshkigal saw her and burst out at her presence. Ishtar, unreflecting, flew at her. Ereshkigal opened her mouth to speak, Saying (these) words to Namtar, her vizier: "Go, Namtar, lock [her] up [in] my [palace]! Release against her, [against] Ishtar, the sixty mis[eries]: Misery of the eyes [against] her [eyes], (70) Misery of the sides ag[ainst] her [sides], Misery of the heart ag[ainst her heart], Misery of the feet ag[ainst] her [feet], Misery of the head ag[ainst her head]Against every part of her, against [her whole body]!"

(Then) lift up thy head, paying mind to the life-water bag:20 "Pray, Lady, let them give me the life-water bag That water therefrom I may drink."21 As soon as Ereshkigal heard this, She smote her thigh,22 bit her finger: "Thou didst request of me a thing that should not be requested. Come, Asushunamir, I will curse thee with a mighty curse!23 The food of the city's gutters24 shall be thy food, The sewers of the city shall be thy drink. The shadow of the wall shall be thy station, The threshold shall be thy habitation, The besotted and the thirsty shall smite thy cheek!"25 Ereshkigal opened her mouth to speak, Saying (these) words to Namtar, her vizier: (30) "Up, Namtar, knock at Egalgina,28 Adorn the thresholds with coral-stone, Bring forth the Anunnaki and seat (them) on thrones of gold, Sprinkle Ishtar with the water of life and take her from my presence!" Forth went Namtar, knocked at Egalgina, Adorned the thresholds with coral-stone, Brought forth the Anunnaki, seated (them) on thrones of gold, Sprinkled Ishtar with the water of life and took her from her presence.27 When through the first gate he had made her go out, He returned to her the breechcloth for her body. When through the second gate he had made her go out, (40) He returned to her the clasps for her hands and feet.

A Vision of the Nether World
Among the thirty-seven texts which E. Ebeling collected in his Tod und Leben ( 1 9 3 1 ) there are several that bear on the subject of myths and epics. For the most part, however, the pertinent material is introduced indirectly, in connection with specific ritual processes.1 Only Nos. 1 and 37—the first and last in the book—are direcdy relevant to the present section and hence have been utilized.2
Such understanding of No. 1 as we now enjoy is due primarily to W. v. Soden, who in ZA, XLIII ( 1 9 3 6 ) produced a thoroughly revised transliteration, accompanied by photographs, translation, introduction, and brief commentary (pp. 1-31). Ebeling came back with a new transliteration in MAOG, x, 2 (1937)1 5 which adds a few further improvements. A translation of the reverse of the text (v. Soden's lines 41-75) is given also by Heidel, GE, 132-136.
28 This continuation of Ereshkigal's instructions appears to be out of place here, as regards the N version. A speaks of the ransom before Ishtar is led away (see the preceding note). T h e mention of T a m m u z is likewise startling in this context. T h e r e is no indication in the Sumerian version—contrary to earlier assumptions—that T a m m u z had gone d o w n to the nether world. T h e concluding part of the myth, therefore, will remain obscure in its allusions so long as additional material is not available. 29 This seems required by the context. It is by no means certain, however, that the final [ . . . ]-»-/« of A goes with [kabittu], 30 cf. Oppenheim, op. cit., 142, n.7. 31 Interpreted as "beads" by R. Campbell Thompson, A Dictionary of Assyrian Chemistry and Geology ( 1 9 3 6 ) , xl.
1 The same is true also of the large text (KAR, 1, 1 9 1 5 , N o . 1 4 3 ) w h i c h deals with the passion and eventual triumph of Bel-Marduk; cf. the study by H. Zimmern, Berichte der sächsischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, phil.-hist. Klasse, LXX ( 1 9 1 8 ) , v, 1 - 5 2 ; see also S. Langdon, Babylonian Epic of Creation, 33-59, and the discussion by S. A. Pallis, The Babylonian Akitu Festival ( 1 9 2 6 ) , pp. 221-34. 2 For No. 37 cf. Creation of Man by the Mother Goddess, pp. 99-100.

The text is inscribed on a large tablet from Ashur, dating from the middle of the seventh century B.C. It is in the form of a prose poem whose lines average over fifty signs each. The background of the story is political, but its mundane allusions are enigmatic and are further obscured by the mutilated character of the obverse. What does emerge is that an Assyrian prince, who is called Kumma8—evidendy a pseudonym—is so presumptuous as to desire a view of the nether world. His desire is at last granted and the realm of Nergal and Ereshkigal is revealed to him in a dream, as recorded on the reverse of the tablet. In the following translation each line of the original is presented as a brief paragraph. The line count follows the count of the reverse; line 1 corresponds to v. Soden's 41, and so on.

The Myth of Zu
This myth deals, in its Akkadian formulation, with the theft of the Tablet of Destinies and the arrogation of the supreme authority of the gods by the bird-god, Zu, who is eventually vanquished by one of the benign deities. It is probable that Zu belongs to the realm of the nether world.1 The extant Sumerian material does not connect him with the episode that constitutes the core of the Akkadian myth. The Semitic versions are fragmentary, so that an adequate comparative study is as yet impossible. Until 1938 there was available only a portion of the Ashurbanipal recension (B). In that year, however, Father V. Scheil published two incomplete tablets of a Susa recension, which dates from Old Babylonian times and presents the two middle tablets—now largely mutilated—of what appears to have been originally a four-tablet composition. Recendy collated and re-edited by J. Nougayrol, the Susa text has lately been supplemented by a close congener discovered among the Ashur tablets; it has been published in transliteration and translation by E. Ebeling. This combined new material (OB Version) helps to fill gaps in the Assyrian Version and carries the story farther. Since the conclusion, however, is still missing, the identity of the god who succeeded eventually in taming Zu remains uncertain. It may have been Ningirsu at the start (with Nougayrol), becoming supplanted by Ninurta (Ebeling) and eventually replaced by Marduk or the given local chief of the pantheon. The translation of the OB Version, which precedes that of the Assyrian recension, has been pieced together from the Scheil-Nougayrol and Ebeling publications.
The Myth of Zu is of outstanding importance in that it links supreme cosmic authority (Enlilship) to the control of the Tablet of Destinies (cf. Epic of Creation, 1, 156). Literature: OB Version, Text, RA, xxxv (1938), 20-23. Transliteration and translation, ibid., 14-19, 22 ff.; J. Nougayrol, RA,

Mammi is described as n i n . m e "Lady of the Norms," (cf. Tallqvist, Ahjkadische Gotterepitheta, 1 9 3 8 , 4 1 4 ) , our Mah-Mammi is glossed here

noted that in the Susa Version the first-born of Ishtar

4 AKKADIAN MYT HS AND EPICS
Etana
The legendary dynasty of Kish which followed the Flood lists among its rulers "Etana, a shepherd, the one who to heaven ascended."1 Cylinder seals of the Old Akkadian period depict a shepherd rising heavenwards on the wings of an eagle.2 And a figure by the name of Etana—a mortal in all respects, except that his name may be written with the determinative for "god," a usage applied also to kings of the Old Akkadian and some of the succeeding dynasties—is the subject of an elaborate legend. The subject matter is thus clearly one of great antiquity. Its popularity, moreover, is attested by the fact that the legend has come down to us in fragments of three recensions: The Old Babylonian ( A ) ; the Middle Assyrian ( B ) ; and the Neo-Assyrian—from the library of Ashurbanipal ( C ) . With the aid of these three versions, of which the latest is by far the bestpreserved, the oudines of the story may be reconstructed as follows:
Etana had been designated to bring to mankind the security that kingship affords. But his life was blighted so long as he remained childless. The one known remedy appeared to be the plant of birth, which Etana must bring down in person from heaven. The difficult problem of the flight to heaven was eventually solved by Etana's enlisting the aid of an eagle. The eagle had betrayed his friend, the serpent, and was languishing in a pit as a result of his perfidy. Etana rescues the bird and, as a reward, is carried by the eagle on a spectacular and fitful flight. Hie text fails us at the critical juncture. But the fact that the king list records the name of Etana's son and heir, and the further fact that myths depicted on seals do not normally commemorate disaster,8 permit the conclusion that the ending was a happy one pfter all.
The various texts which represent the Old Babylonian and the Neo-Assyrian recensions (A and C) have been republished by S. Langdon in Babyloniaca, XII (1931), Pis. i-xiv, and have been discussed by him, ibid., pp. 1-53. Our text references will be limited in the main to Langdon's copies, which furnish also an adequate guide to the respective sources. But Langdon's attempt to piece together a consecutive story from documents separated by more than a millennium has not been followed in this translation. Instead, the material has been grouped according to periods. Thirteen years after Langdon's publication, E. Ebeling was able to add to the Etana material by publishing fragments of a Middle Assyrian version, AfO, xiv (1944), Pis. ix-x, and pp. 298-303, together with new Neo-Assyrian fragments, ibid., Pis. XI-XII, and pp. 303-07. Older translations include those of P. lensen, KB, vi, 1 (1900), 100-15, and 581-88; and of E. Ebeling, AOT, 23540.4 Detailed references will be given with each of the headings in the translation which follows.

The eagle inspected the flesh, He examined its front and its hind parts.
Again he inspected the flesh, examining its front and

The eagle opened his mouth, saying to the serpent:
"Have mercy upon me, and I will bestow
upon thee
A marriage gift, like unto a bridegroom!" (50)
The serpent opened his mouth, saying to the eagle:
"If I release thee, how shall I answer Shamash on high?
Thy punishment would be turned against me,

"Thou art evil and hast grieved me gravely!
The detested of the gods (and) the forbidden thou didst
eat
Though thou hast sworn, I will not come to thee I
(But) lo, a man that I will send to thee,

The Legend of Sargon
The legend concerning the birth of Sargon of Agade is available in two incomplete Neo-Assyrian copies (A and B) and in a Neo-Babylonian fragment ( C ) . All three were published in CT, XIII (1901): A—PI. 42; B and C—PI. 43. Text B alone contains incomplete lines of a second column; it is uncertain whether this column bore any relation to the Sargon legend.1 A composite text of the actual legend, with variant readings, transliteration, and translation was published by L. W. King in his Chronicles Concerning Early Babylonian Kings, n (1907), 8796. Latest (partial) translation and discussion: H. G. Giiterbock, ZAt x u i (1934), 62-64.* *(See Addenda.)
Sargon, the mighty king, king of Agade, am I.
My mother was a high priestess, my father I knew not.
The brother(s) of my father loved the hills.
My city is Azupiranu, which is situated on the banks of
the Euphrates.
My mother, the high priestess, conceived me, in secret
she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed
my lid.3
loc. cit., has even suggested i-haJ-Ial "he grinds" as a possible reading. In view, however, of the points made in the Introduction, it is improbable that the adventure ended in death. Langdon would fill part of the break with the small fragment K 8563
rev. (Babyloniaca, xn, PI. ix, and p. 52). It is too slight and inconclusive for a connected translation. But mention is made in it of Etana's wife, his kingship, and his ghost. Do we have here a speech addressed to Etana's son, BaliJ), whom the king list places immediately after Etana ( T h . Jacobsen, The Sumerian King List, 1939, 80-81)? A t all events, the prevailing view that Etana's flight resulted in misfortune would seem to stand in need of confirmation.
1 The second column of B is duplicated by C T , XLVI, 46. 2 For some parallel accounts cf. P. Jensen's article, Aussetzungsgeschichten, Reallexikpn der Assyriologie, 1 (1928), 322-24. 3 Lit. "door."

The giving of the bull Seris,6 a wagon or chariot and of other objects is also mentioned. It seems as though the Storm-god speaks of his future greatness and promises Anus to revenge him [ii 4-22].

Indeed it seems that Kumarbis received something to eat. However it hurts his mouth and he begins to moan [ii 39-54].

Kumarbis, and Imbaluris walked before him. Kumarbis

lifted the child and pressed it to their breast like a

Ellil lifted his eyes and b[eheld] the child as it stood
in his divine presence. His body was made of diorite. Ellil began to speak to h[is min]d: "Who is that child
whom the Good-women (and) the Mother-goddesses
reared ? No one among the great gods will see mightier
battles. No one's vileness [equals] Kumarbis'. Just as
Kumarbis raised the Storm-god, he has [now raised]

he increases one acre. The stone which is added to his
stature presents an amazing spectacle. When the 15th day came, the stone had grown high.
He [was standing] in the sea with his knees (as) a
shaft. It stood out above the water, the stone, and in
height it (was) like [a pillar]. The sea reached up to its
belt like a (loin)cloth. Like a tower the stone is raised
up and reaches up to the temples and the \untarra
house4 in heaven. The Sun-god looked down from the sky and caught
sight of Ullikummis. Ullikummis too saw the Sun-god.
The Sun-god [said]: "What vigorous god [is standing
there] in the sea? His body is not like (that of) the
[other] gods." The Sun-god of Heaven [descended(?)] and went
out into the sea. [ . . · ] · The Sun-god laid his hand to
his forehead [ . . . ] . In wrath he shook his fists.5
[Whe]n [the Sun-god of] Heaven had seen [Ullikum
mis], the Sun-god [entered] the horizon for a second
time again, set forth [from . .. ] and [betook himself]
to the Storm-god. [When he] saw the Sun-god coming,
Tasmisus6 [began to speak these words]: "Is this not
the Sun-god of Heaven coming ? The errand on which
he is coming, that errand must be [momentous] . . . . It
(must be) a grave vexation, [it] (must be) a grave
[menace]. It fore[bodes] upheaval in heaven."* The Storm-god began to speak to Tasmisus: "Let
them set up [a seat for him on which to sit down]!
Let them set a table from which to eat!"
No sooner had they spoken thus, than the Sun-god
[reached] them. They set up a seat for him on which
to sit down, but he [sat] not. They set a table (with
food), but he served himself not. They gave him a cup,
but he took not a drop.7 The god, the Storm-god, began to speak to the Sun
god: "Who is the bad chamberlain who set up a chair
for thee and thou sattest not ? Who is the bad table man
who set a table (with food) and thou eatest not? Who
is the bad cupbearer who gave [thee wine] and thou
drankest not? [ · · · ] · "

[When these words] the Storm-god heard, in wradi [he sh]ook [his fists].5 [To the Sun-god of Heaven] the Storm-god began to speak: "[On the table the bread] shall become pleasant, so eat thou! In [the cup the wine] shall become pleasant, so [drink thou! Eat and] satisfy thy hunger, drink and quench thy thirst! [Then mjount [thy chariot] and ascend to heaven!"

ascended to heaven. After [the Sun-god's departure] the Storm-god thinks
out wise thoughts in his mind. The Storm-god and
Tasmisus took each other by the hands and [they set]
forth from the kuntarra> the house of the gods. But
Ishtar set out from heaven with . . . , and Ishtar spoke
in her own mind: "where are they running to, the two
brethren?" She .. . stopped, she Ishtar, and before the
two brethren she stood up. They took one another by
the hands and ascended Mount Hazzi8 while the king
of Kummiya set his eye, his eye he set on the awesome
diorite man. He looked at the awesome diorite man and
in wrath he shook his fists.
The Storm-god sat down on the ground, while tears
streamed [from his eyes] as in water courses. With tears
streaming from his eyes the Storm-god speaks the word:
"Who can bear to look upon so vexatious a sight ? Who
will dare go and battle [against the monster] ? Who can
bear seeing his terrifying [ . . . ] . . . s?" Ishtar replies
t[o the Storm-god, her brother]: "My brother! Is there

whom [ . . . ] . . . [have] begotten? [...]."

Ishtar is singing and a . . . pebble from the sea she
puts on. Out of the sea a great wave (rises) and the

is blind and sees not. He has no willing heart Go away,
O Ishtar, thy brother find while he has not yet become

Like a tower he was lifted up, (he) the diorite man, so that he reached up to the kuntarra house. [Altogether his height was 9,000 leagues, that diorite man, and his girth 9,000 leagues. He stood [over] the gate of Kummiya like [a . . . ]. He, the diorite man, made Hebat13 leave her temple. Hence Hebat could no longer hear the message of the gods, nor could she see with her eyes the Storm-god and Suwaliyattas.14
Hebat began to speak this word to Takitis:13 "I cannot hear the mighty word of the Storm-god. Nor can I hear the message of Suwaliyattas and of all the gods. Should that being whom they call Ullikummis, the diorite man, have vanquished my [husband] the mighty [Stormgod]?" Hebat began to speak this word to Takitis: "O Takitis, listen! Take thy staff in thy hand, put swift shoes on thy feet! Go and [call] the gods into a[ssembly!] The diorite man may have killed [my husband, the no]ble king. [Bring] n[ews back] to me!"

[Whe]n Tasmisus heard the Storm-god's words, he rose instandy, [took] his staff in his hand, put swift shoes on his feet and went forth to the high watchtower. Facing·Hebat he took [his stand] (saying): "In a lowly place [my lord will have to stay] until he has fulfilled the years ordained for him." When Hebat saw Tasmisus, she barely missed falling from the roof. She would have fallen down, but her girls caught her and stopped her (falling). When Tasmisus had ended speaking his word, he descended from the watchtower and went to the Storm-god. Tasmisus began to speak to the Storm-god: "Where shall we sit down?—on Mount Kandurna ? [While] we sit on Mount Kandurna, someone else will be seated on Mount Lalapaduwa. [If] we move anywhere else, there will be no king in heaven." Tasmisus began to speak to the Storm-god: "My lord! Hearken to my words! To the words I am telling thee give ear! Come! Let us go before Ea to Apsu,16 let us ask for the old tablets with the words [of fate]! [When] we arrive at the door of Ea's house [we shall bow] to Ea's doors [five times, and] we shall bow to Ea's . . . five times.

He will hand over to us the old [ .. . tablets]." [When the Storm-god] heard [Tasmisus'] words, he hastened (and) hurried. Instantly he rose from his seat. [The Storm-god] and [Tasmisus] took each other by the hand, covered the distance without stopping a single time and [arrived] in Apsu.

(his) eyes [and beheld him]. Ubelluris [began to speak]
to Ea: "Long life to thee, Ea! [What makes thee come]
up [here?" Ea wished] life to Ubelluris [ . . . ] and
[ . . . ] Ubelluris [was standing on] the dark earth, he
upon whom [ . . . ] . . . was built. Ea began to speak [these words] to Ubelluris: "Know
est thou not, O Ubelluris? Did no one bring thee the
news? Doest thou not know him, that vigorous god
whom Kumarbis has fashioned to oppose the gods ? or
the frightful death which Kumarbis is plotting for the
Storm-god ? He is fashioning for him a rival who has
thriven in the sea as a diorite stone. Doest thou not know
him? Like a tower he is lifted up and has blocked off
heaven, the holy houses of the gods, and Hebat. (Is it)
because thou art far away from the dark earth, Ubelluris,
(that) thou doest not know of that vigorous god ?" Ubelluris began to speak to Ea: "When they built
heaven and earth upon me I did not know anything.
When they came and severed the heaven from the earth
with a cleaver, I did not know that either. Now my
right shoulder is a little sore. But I do not know who
that god is." When Ea heard these words, he turned Ubelluris'
shoulder as the diorite man stood upon Ubelluris' right
shoulder like a shaft.
Ea began to speak to the olden gods the words:
"Listen ye, olden gods, ye who know the olden words!
Open ye the ancient storehouses of the fathers and fore
fathers! Let them bring the olden seals of the fathers
and let them seal them up again with them afterward!
Let them bring [for]th the olden copper knife with

OLDER VERSION
(i) These are the words of Kellas, the "anointed"1 of
the Storm-god of Nerik. What follows is the cult legend
of the Purulli Festival2 of the Storm-god of Heaven,
(the version which) they no longer tell:
(5) May the land flourish (and) prosper! May the
land be (well) protected! If it flourishes (and) prospers,
they will celebrate the Purulli Festival. When the Storm-god and the Dragon Illuyankas (10)
came to grips in Kiskilussa, the Dragon Illuyankas
vanquished the Storm-god.
The Storm-god besought all the gods: "Come ye to
my aid! Let Inaras prepare a celebration!"
(15) He made everything ready on a grand scale:
amphorae of wine, amphorae of marnuwan, (and) am
phorae of walhi.* The amphorae he had filled to the
brim.
Inaras went to Zigaratta (and) encountered Hupa
siyas, a mortal.
Thus spoke Inaras: "See, Hupasiyas! Such and such41
want to do. I would have thee aid me!"
Thus spoke Hupasiyas to Inaras: (25) "So be it! Let
me sleep with thee, and I will come (and) fulfill thy
wishes!" And he slept with her.
Inaras took Hupasiyas to the place and hid him.
Inaras (ii 5®) put on her finery and lured the Dragon
Illuyankas up from his lair: "See! I am holding a cele
bration. Come thou to eat and to drink!" The Dragon Illuyankas came up with [his children]

(10) and they ate (and) drank. They drank every am
phora dry and quenched their thirst.
Thereupon they are no longer able to descend to their
lair. Hupasiyas came (15) and trussed the Dragon
Illuyankas with a rope.
®The Storm-god came and killed the Dragon Illu
yankas and the gods were with him.
Inaras built herself a house on a cliff (15) in the land
of Tarukka. She made Hupasiyas live in that house.
Inaras instructs him: "When I go to the country, thou
shalt not look out erf the window! If thou lookest out,
thou mayest see thy wife and thy children." When twenty days had passed, that man opened the
window and [he saw] his wife and his children. (25) When Inaras came home from the country, he
began to moan: "Let me go home!"
(iiT) Thus spoke Ina[ras to Hupasiyas]: "Thou shalt
[not] op,en the [window again]!" She [killed him] in
the quarrel and the Storm-god sowed sahlu8 [over the
ruins of the house]. That man [came to a] griev[ous
end].
(15) Inaras [returned] to Kiskil[ussa. But] her house
. . . she placed . . . [in] the hand of the king. From the
time on that we celebrated the first Purulli Festival, the
hand of [the king has been supreme] in the... of Inaras.
(There follow two more sections before a break. The
word "rain" seems to play an important part in them.)
LATER VERSION
iii9) [This is the way in] which [ . . . ] told it [later]:
The Dragon Illuyankas vanquished the Storm-god and
took (his) heart and (his) eyes away from him. The
Storm-god [sought to revenge himself] upon him. He took the daughter of the poor man (5) for his
wife and he begat a son. When he grew up, he took the
daughter of the Dragon Illuyankas in marriage.
The Storm-god instructs his son: (10) "When thou
goest to the house of thy wife, ask them for (my) heart
and (mine) eyes!"
When he went there, he asked them for (the) heart
and they gave that to him. (15) Later he asked for (the)
eyes, and they gave him those too. He brought them to
the Storm-god, his father. Thus the Storm-god got back
his heart and his eyes.
(20) When his frame had been restored to its old
state, he left to the Sea for battle. When he had engaged
the Dragon Illuyankas in battle, (25) he came close to
vanquishing him. But the son of the Storm-god, who
was with Illuyankas, shouted up to heaven to his father: "Count me as with (him)! (30) Spare me not!" So
the Storm-god killed the Dragon Illuyankas and his son
too. In this way the Storm-god got even with the
Dragon Illuyankas.

by which the rank and the order of the gods were estab
lished. The most significant verb in the text is pu-u
ul(-)tiyanzi; it may contain an etymology of the name
of the Purulli Festival. Unfortunately its meaning is not
clear; the context suggests "compete" or "race" as a
possibility.)
All the gods arrive (15) and they compete. Of all the
gods Zashapunas of Kastama was the greatest. Because
Zalanuisas is his wife, and Tazzuwasis his concubine,
(20) they made these three live in Tanipiyas. (An estate is endowed for them there.)
The Telepinus Myth
Texts: The main text is KUB, xvn, 10. Numerous additional fragments of a similar character have been edited and classified by H. Otten in KUB, xxxui. The same author has dealt with the whole material in great detail in his book Die Überlieferungen des Telipinu-Mythus (MVAG, XLVI/I [1942]). He assigns the surviving material to four different versions. A similar tale is also associated with the Storm-god. Literature: Besides the book just quoted, the translation of the main , text by A. Götze in Kulturgeschichte Kleinasiens (1933), 134 ff.; 2nd ed. (1957), 143 f. is still of interest; Otten's book does not deal with the main text.
a. The God's Anger, His Disappearance and Its Consequences
(The upper third of the tablet, about 20 lines, is
broken off. It probably told the reasons for the god's
anger.) (i) Telepinus [flew into a rage and shouted:] "There
must be no interference!" In his agitation] he tried to
put [his right shoe] on his left foot and his left [shoe
on his right foot]. . . . [ . . . ] .
(5) Mist seized the windows, smoke seized the house.
In the fireplace the logs were stifled, at the altars the
gods were stifled, in the fold the sheep were stifled, in
the stable the cattle were stifled. The sheep neglected its
lamb, the cow neglected its calf.
(10) Telepinus walked away and took grain, (fertile)
breeze, . . . . . . . and satiation to the country, the
meadow, the steppes. Telepinus went and lost himself in the steppe; fatigue overcame him. So grain (and) spelt thrive no longer. So cattle, sheep and man no
longer (15) breed. And even those with young cannot
bring them forth.
The vegetation dried up; the trees dried up and would
bring forth no fresh shoots. The pastures dried up, the
springs dried up. In the land famine arose so that man
and gods perished from hunger. The great Sun-god
arranged for a feast and invited the thousand gods. They
ate, (20) but they did not satisfy their hunger; they
drank, but they did not quench their thirst.
b. The Search for the Vanished God
The Storm-god became anxious about Telepinus, his
son: "Telepinus, my son, (he said) is not here. He has



HITTITE MYTHS, E
«
flown into a rage and taken (with him) every good
thing." The great gods and the lesser gods began to
search for Telepinus. The Sun-god sent out the swift
Eagle (saying): "Go! Search every high (25) moun
tain!"
"Search the deep valleys! Search the watery depth!"
The Eagle went, but he could not find him. Back to the
Sun-god he brought his message: "I could not find him,
him, Telepinus, the noble god." The Storm-god said to
Hannahannas1: "What shall we do? (30) We shall die
of hunger." Hannahannas said to the Storm-god: "Do
something, O Storm-god! Go! Search for Telepinus thy
self!"
The Storm-god began to search for Telepinus. In his
city he [knock] s at the gate, but he is not there and
opens not. He broke open his bolt and his lock, [but he
has no luck], the Storm-god. So he gave up and sat
down to rest. Hannahannas (35) sent [out the Bee]:
"Go! Search thou for Telepinus!"2
[The Storm-god s]aid [to Hannahannas]: "The great
gods (and) the lesser gods have searched for him, but
[did not find] him. Shall then this [Bee] go out [and
find him] ? Its wings are small, it is small itself. Shall
they admit that it is greater than they ?"
'Hannahannas said to the Storm-god: "Enough! It
will go (and) find him." Hannahannas sent out the little
Bee: "Go! Search thou for Telepinus! When thou find
est him, sting him on his hands (and) his feet! Bring
him to his feet! Take wax and wipe his eyes and his feet,
purify him and bring him before me!" The Bee went away and searched . . . the streaming
rivers, and searched the murmuring springs. The honey
within it gave out, [the wax within it] gave out. Then
[it found] him in a meadow in the grove at Lihzina.
It stung him on his hands and his feet. It brought him
to his feet, it took wax and wiped his eyes (and) his
feet, [it purified him] and [ . . . ] .
[Telepinus.. . ] declares: "For my part I had flown
into a rage [and walked away. How dare] ye a[rouse
me] from my sleep? How dare ye force me to talk
when enraged ?" He grew [still more infu]riated. [He
stopped] the murmuring springs, he diverted the flow
ing rivers and made them flow over their banks. He
[blocked off] the clay pits, he shattered [the windo]ws,
he shattered the houses.
He had men perish, he had sheep and cattle perish.
[It came to] pass that the gods [despaire]d (asking):
"Wh[y has Te]lepinus become [so infur]iated? [Wh]at
shall we do? [What] shall we do?"
[The great Sun-god(? ?) declares: "[Fetch ye] man!
Let him [t]ake the spring Hattara on mount Ammuna
[as.. . ]! Let him (man) make him move! With the

of magic and healing, is commissioned to pacify Tele
pinus and to bring him back.)

ENTREATY
(The beginning5 is multilated.)
(ii) "O Telepinus! [Here lies] sweet and soothing
[cedar essence. Just as it is . . . ], [even so let] the stifled
[be set right] again! "Here [I have] upthrusting sap [with which to purify
thee]. (10) Let it [invigorate] thy heart and thy soul, O
Telepinus! Toward the king [turn] in favor! "Here lies chaff. [Let his heart (and) soul] be segre
gated [like it]! Here lies an ear [of grain]. Let it attract
his heart [(and) his soul]! "(15) Here lies sesame. [Let his heart (and) his soul]
be comforted by it. Here [lie] figs. Just as [figs] are
sweet, even so let Te[lepinus' heart (and) soul] become
sweet! "Just as the olive [holds] oil within it, [as the grape]
(20) holds wine within it, so hold thou, Telepinus, in
(thy) heart (and thy) soul good feelings [toward the
king]! "Here lies ointment. Let it anoint Telepin[us' heart
(and) soul]! Just as malt (and) malt-loaves are harmo
niously fused, even so let thy soul be in harmony with
the affairs of mankind! [Just as spelt] (25) is clean,
even so let Telepinus' soul become clean! J[ust as] honey
is sweet, as cream is smooth, even so let Telepinus' soul
become sweet and even so let him become smooth! "See, O Telepinus! I have now sprinkled thy ways
with fine oil. So walk thou, Telepinus, over these ways
that are sprinkled with fine oil! (30) Let lahil wood
and happurialal wood be at hand! Let us set thee right,
O Telepinus, into whatever state of mind is the right
one!" Telepinus came in his fury. Lightning flashed, it
thundered while the dark earth was in turmoil. (35)
Kamrusepas saw him. The eagle's wing made him move
out there. It took off him (iii) the rage, it took off him
the anger, it took off him [the ire], it took off him the
fury.
KAMRUSEPAS' RITUAL OF PURIFICATION
Kamrusepas tells the gods: "Come ye, O gods! See!
Hapantallis is shepherding the Sun-god's sheep. (5)
Select ye twelve rams! I want to fix long days for Tele
pinus. I have taken death, one thousand eyes.6 I have
strewn about the selected sheep of Kamrusepas.
"Over Telepinus I have swung them this way and
that. (10) From Telepinus' body I have taken the evil,

I have taken the malice. I have taken the rage, I have taken the anger, I have taken the ire, I have taken the fury. "When Telepinus was angry, his heart (and) his soul were stifled (like) firebrands. (15) Just as they burned diese brands, even so let Telepinus' rage, anger, malice (and) fury burn themselves out! Just as [malt] is barren, (as) people do not bring it to the field to use it for seed, (as) people do not make it into bread (or) put it in the storehouse, even so let Telepinus' rage, [anger], (20) malice (and) fury become barren! "When Telepinus was angry, [his heart (and) his soul] were a burning fire. Just as this fire [is quenched], even so let (his) rage, anger (and) fury [be quenched] too! "O Telepinus, give up thy rage, [give up] thine anger, (25) give up thy fury! Just as (water in) a pipe flows not upward, even so let Telepinus' [rage, anger (and)] fury not [come] back! "The gods [were gathered] in assembly under the hatal\elnal tree. For the hatal\elnal tree I have fixed long [years]. (30) All gods are now present, (including) the [ls]tustayas, the Good-women (and) the Mothergoddesses, the Grain-god; Miyatanzipas, Telepinus, Inaras, Hapantaliyas (and) the Patron of the field. For these gods I have fixed long years; I have purified him, [O Telepinus]!

MAN'S RITUAL
(The beginning is lost, but Telepinus is addressed:)7 . . (When) thou [departedst] from the hatdkesnas tree on a summer day, the crop got smutted. (When) the ox departed [with thee], (iv)8 thou wastedst its shape. (When) the sheep departed with thee, thou wastedst its form. O Telepinus, stop rage, anger, malice (and) fury!
7 Text for the first few lines is taken from KUB, xx.xni, 54 13-15. 8 Here the fourth column of KUB, xvn, 10 begins.
"(When) the Storm-god comes in his wrath, the Storm-god's priest (5) stops him. (When) a pot of food boils over, the (stirring) spoon stops it. Even so let the word of me, the mortal, stop Telepinus' rage, anger, and fury! "Let Telepinus' rage, anger, malice, (and) fury depart! Let the house let them go, let the interior . . . let them go, (10) let the window let them go! In the . . . let the interior courtyard let them go, let the gate let them go, let the gateway let them go, let the road of the king let them go! Let it not go to the thriving field, garden (or) grove! Let it go the way of the Sun-god of the nether world! "The doorkeeper has opened the seven doors, has unlocked the seven bolts. (15) Down in the dark earth there stand bronze cauldrons, their lids are of abarumetal, their handles of iron. Whatever goes in there v comes not out again; it perishes therein. Let them also receive Telepinus' rage, anger, malice (and) fury! Let them not come back!"
d. The God's Home-Coming
(20) Telepinus came home to his house and cared (again) for his land. The mist let go of the windows, the smoke let go of the house. The altars were set right for the gods, the hearth let go of the log. He let the sheep go to the fold, he let the cattle go to the pen. The mother tended her child, the ewe tended her lamb, (25) the cow tended her calf. Also Telepinus tended the king and the queen and provided them with enduring life and vigor. Telepinus cared for the king. A pole was erected before Telepinus and from this pole the fleece of a sheep was suspended. It signifies fat of the sheep, it signifies grains of corn . . . (and) (30) wine, it signifies catde (and) sheep, it signifies long years of progeny.
It signifies the lamb's favorable message.9 It signifies It signifies fruitful breeze. It signifies .. . satiation. . . .10

Ugaritic Myths, Epics, and Legends
TRANSLATOR: H. L. GINSBERG
Ugaritic poetry falls into distinct metrical units, but these were not indicated outwardly by the scribes. In the following translation, every colon is printed on a separate line. Isolated cola are not common. As a rule there are two, and sometimes there are three, to a stich. In the translation, the second and third cola in each stich are indented. The numbers in the right margin are those of the lines in the Ugaritic tablet, which, as has been explained, do not coincide with the cola.*
Poems about Baal and Anath
Both large and small fragments of tablets containing poetic mythological texts in which the leading role is played by the rain- and fertility-god Baal and the next in importance by the warrior-goddess Anath came to light in the French excavations of Ras Shamra-Ugarit in the years 1930, 1931, and 1933, and at least one small fragment (which may be a duplicate of one of the others) in 1929. Because so many letters, words, lines, columns, and probably some whole tablets are missing, not all of the tablets can be declared, with certainty, to be parts of the great epic of Baal and arranged in their proper order within it. However, in the following translations, even small fragments whose pertinence to the larger epic is probable have, for the most part, been included (if only, in a few desperate cases, in the form of sketchy summaries) and assigned tentative positions within it. Tablets whose pertinence to the larger poem is doubtful have been added at the end by way of an appendix.
In view of all these uncertainties, the tablets will not be designated as B'L A, B'L B, etc., but by the original sigla of the first editor, Ch. Virolleaud. They are all studied together by C. H. Gordon, Ugaritic Literature, Rome (1949), pp. 9-55 (56?). Other literature will be given separately for each tablet.

Editions: Ch. Virolleaud, La diesse 'Anat (Paris, 1938), pp. 91-102 and the last photograph; C. H. Gordon, Ugaritic Handbook, 11, pp. 189-190, 'nt, pis. ix-x (transliteration only). Studies: A. Herdner, Syria, x x m (1942-43), 283-285. Owing to the very poor state of preservation, connected translation is possible only for groups of lines which, because they are stereotyped, can be completed with the help of parallels; while just the crucial passages are very doubtful. It seems, however, that El, die head of the pantheon, ( 1 ) instructs the craftsman-god Kothar waKhasis to build a palace on his (El's) grounds, the name of the latter being Khurshan-zur-kas (col. iii), (2) announces that his (eldest? favorite?) son is to be known as El's Beloved Yamm ( = Sea) and as Master (cf. iv 15, 20 with II AB ii 34-35, and iv 17 with III AB B 17, 33-34), and (3) perhaps authorizes Yamm to banish Baal from his throne (iii 22-25).
b. Ill AB C
Editions: Ch. Virolleaud, Syria, xxiv (1944-45), 1-12; C. H. Gordon, Ugaritic Handbook> "> Text 129. This fragment comprises 24 very mutilated lines from the right-hand column on one of the sides of a tablet with two very broad columns on each side. Such a tablet is the one of whose col. i, III AB B is the lower part, and of whose col. iv, III AB A is the upper part; Virolleaud
therefore surmises that III AB C is part of (the lower half of) col. iii of the same tablet. For its content, however, a position between III AB B and III AB A seems strange; so, perhaps, it belongs to a tablet which preceded, and in outward disposition resembled, the tablet of which III AB B-A is a remnant. In it, El instructs Kothar to build a palace for Yamm. Ashtar complains of not being accorded the like favor.
[ . . . There] he is off on his way (3)
To El of the Sources [of the Floods,
In the midst of the headwaters of the Two Oceans.

"Look thou, Qadesh wa-Amrur,
Fisherman of Lady] Asherah of the Sea! [Saddle a donkey],
Harness a jackass.
[Attach trappings of] silver,
[A housing] of gol[d],
Put on the trappings of [thy] she-asses." Qad[esh] wa-Amrur obeys. He saddles a donkey,
Harnesses a jackass. He attaches trappings of silver, (10) A housing of gold, Puts on the trappings of his she-asses. Qadesh wa-Amrur embraces
And places Asherah on the donkey's back,
On the beautiful back of the jackass. Qadesh proceeds to lead,
Amrur is like a star in front;
The Maiden Anath follows,
While Baal leaves for Zaphon's summit.
There, she21 is off on her way (20) Towards El of the Sources of the Two Floods
In the midst of the headwaters of the Two Oceans.
She penetrates El's field and enters The pavilion of King Father Shunem.
At El's feet she bows and falls down, Prostrates her and does him reverence.
As soon as El espies her,
He parts his jaws and laughs. His feet upon the footstool he puts
And doth twiddle his fingers. (30) He lifts up his voice and [cri]es:
"Why is come Lady Asher[ah of the S]ea?
Why hither the Progenitress of the G[ods] ? Art thou become hungry and fa[int],
Or art become thirsty and pa[rched] ? Eat, pray, yea drink. Ea[t] thou from the tables bread;
Drink from the flagons wine,
From the golden gob(lets) blood of vines.
See, El the King's love stirs thee,
Bull's affection arouses thee." Quoth Lady Asherah of the Sea: (40) "Thy decree, O El, is wise: Wisdom with ever-life thy portion. Thy decree is: our king's Puissant Baal, Our sovereign second to none; All of us must bear his gi[ft], All of us [must b]ear his purse.22 [But alas!] He. cries unto Bull El his father, To [El] the King his begetter; He cries unto Asherah and her children, Elath and the band of her kin[dred]: Look, no house has Baal like the gods, (50) Nor court like the children of Asherah.

The abode of El is the shelter of his son.
The abode of Lady Asherah of the Sea Is the abode of the perfect brides:
The abode of Padriya daughter of Ar,
The shelter of Talliya daughter of Rabb,
(And) the abode of Arsiya daughter of Ya'abdar."
Quoth the Kindly One El Ben[ign]:
"Am I a slave, an attendant of Asherah? Am I a slave, to handle . . . ? (60)
Or is Asherah a handmaid, to make bricks ?
(v)
Let a house be built for Baal like the gods',
And a court like the children of Asherah's!"
Quoth Lady Asherah of the Sea:
"Art great indeed, O El, and wise, Thy beard's gray hair instructs thee,
. . . , [ . . . ] to thy breast.
Now, too, the seasons of his rains will Baal observe, The seasons o f . . . with snow; And (he will) peal his thunder in the clouds, (70) Flashing his lightnings to the earth.
The house of cedar—let him burn it; Yea, the house of brick—remove it.
Be it told to Puissant Baal:
Summon weeds into thy house, Herbs into the midst of thy palace.2*
The mountains shall bring thee much silver,
The hills a treasure of gold;
They'll bring thee god's grandeur aplenty.
So build thou a silver and gold house, (8b) A house of most pure lapis lazuli."
The Maiden Anath rejoices, Stamps with her foot so the earth quakes.
There, she is off on her way Unto Baal upon Zaphon's summit,
O'er a thousand fields, ten thousand acres.
Laughing, the Maiden Anath Lifts up her voice and cries:
"Receive, Baal, the glad tidings I bring thee.
They will build thee a house like thy brethren's (90) And a court like unto thy kindred's.
Summon weeds into thy house, Herbs into the midst of thy palace.
The mountains shall bring thee much silver,
The hills a treasure of gold;
They'll bring thee god's grandeur aplenty. So build thou a silver and gold house,
A house of most pure lapis lazuli."
Puissant Baal rejoiced.
He summoned weeds into his house, Herbs into the midst of his palace.
The mountains did bring him much silver, (100) The hills a treasure of gold;
They brought him god's grandeur aplenty. Then he (se)nt unto Kothar wa-Khasis.
28 This seems—if the sense is correctly guessed—to imply that Baal had some sort of habitation before, but that it was not one worthy of a "ranking" god, such as Baal had become by vanquishing Yamm.

After this comes Kothar wa-Khasis. Before him an ox is set, A fatted one at his disposal. A throne is placed and he's seated To the right of Puissant Baal. (no) So ate [the gods] and drank.

Quickly the house shalt thou build, Quickly shalt raise up the pa [lace] In the midst of the fastness of Zaphon. A thousand fields the house shall cover, A myriad of acres the palace." Quoth Kothar wa-Khasis: (120) "Hearken, O Puissant Baal: Give heed, O rider of the Clouds. A window I'll make in the house, A casement within the palace." But Puissant Baal replied: "Make not a window in [the house], [A casement] within the pal[ace]." (2 or 3 lines missing?)
(vi)
Quoth Ko[thar wa-Khas]is: "Thou'lt heed [my words], O Baal." Again spake Ko[thar wa]-Khasis: "Hark, pray, Pu[is]sant Baal! A wi[nd]ow I'll make in the house, A casement withi[n the pa] lace." But Puissa[nt] Baal replied: "Make not a w[ind]ow in the house, A casement with [in the pa] lace. Let not [Padriya] daughter of Ar [be seen] (10) Or T[alliya] daughter of Rabb be espied By [ . . . ] El's Beloved Yamm!" [... ] cried defiance And spat [ . · . ] .

Lo, a [d]ay and a second,
Fire feeds on the house,
Flame upon the palace:
A third, a fourth day,
[Fi]re feeds on the house,
Flam[e] upon the palace.
A fifth, a s[ix]th day,
Fire feeds [on] the house,
Flame u[pon] the palace. (30)
There, on the seventh d[ay],
The fire dies down in the house,
The f [la]me in the palace.
The silver turns into blocks,
The gold is turned into bricks.
Puissant Baal exults:
"My h(ouse) have I builded of silver;
My palace, indeed, of gold."
For (his) house preparations [Baa]l makes,
[Prepa]rations makes Hadd for his palace. (40)
He slaughters both neat [and] small cattle, Fells bulls [together with] fadings; Rams (and) one-year-ol[d] calves;
Lambs . . . k[i]ds.
He summons his brethren to his house,
His ki[nd]red within his palace:
Summons Asherah's seventy children.
He sates the he-lamb gods with w[ine], He sates the ewe-lamb goddesses [ . . . ? ]
He sates the bull-gods with w[ine], He sates the cow-goddesses [ . . . ?] (50) He sates the throne-gods with wi[ne\ He sates the chair-goddesses | . . . ?]
He sates the gods with jars of wine, He sates the goddesses with pitchers.
So eat the gods and drink.

While drinking the [wine] from flag[ons,
From gold cups the blood of vines].

(The first 8 lines are very defective. El's Beloved Yamm—see above vi 12—figures in lines 3-4. Since Baal's misgivings about a window are thereupon dispelled—15 ff.—perhaps Yamm is here given his quietus.)
Sixty-six towns he took,
Seventy-seven hamlets; (10)
Eighty (took) Baal of [Zaphon's] s[ummit],
Ninety Baal of the sum[mit. Baal] dwells in his house,
Baal in the midst of the house.

Only about one-half of this tablet is preserved, essentially the half containing the bottom of the obverse (cols, i-iii) and the top of the reverse (cols, iv-vi). Since the top of the first column on the reverse is always continuous with the bottom of the last column on the obverse, there are not six but only five pieces of continuous text. However, the first editor found it convenient to divide one of these into two episodes, making a total of six episodes designated as V AB A-F. The position assigned to V AB in this translation of the Baal epic was determined by E 25-26; from which it appears that El's favorite-and-bully is now Mot, whereas he is still Yamm in II AB (our e) vi 12. But final judgment must be reserved.

g. I* AB
T w o fragments, discovered in 1930 and 1931 respectively, were found to fit together, but about an equal amount of text is still missing from the tablet to which they belong. Though the top of col. i happens to be preserved, it does not exhibit the copyist's signature "Pertaining to 'Baal'" which ought to have occupied line 1 according to rule. However, thanks to the circumstance that the bottom of col. vi is also preserved, it is obvious that the direct continuation of this tablet is I AB, which has the expected superscription.

Ginsberg, Orientalia NS, v (1936), 161-196; Kitbe Ugarit, 4756; The Ras Shamra Mythological Texts, 78-84; AKTRSch., 3541; Ugaritic Handboo\, 11, No. 67. Studies: U. Cassuto, Dissertationes in Honor em Dr. Eduardi Mahler (Budapest, 1937), 53-57; Tarbiz, XII (1941), 169-180. Col. i lines 1-8 represent the conclusion of a message which Mot has been instructing Gapn and Ugar, the messengers of Baal, to deliver to the latter. In order to be in Mot's presence, they must previously have been sent to him by Baal. Since we read of just such a mission in the incomplete last column of II AB (our e), it is possible that if that column were complete its text would be found to precede ours direcdy, in other words, to end with the first half of Mot's message; but other considerations suggest that V AB (our f) may have intervened. In any case, the first half of Mot's original speech can for the most part easily be restored, since the entire speech is repeated by Gapn and Ugar in full—though slighdy damaged—in the first column of our tablet. But it is so obscure that we shall skip most of it.

probable. That only one side of the tablet is written on is probably due to the fact that it contained the whole of the composition in question, which was quite short. It has no colophon. It is distinct from the Baal epic which we have been following in the preceding pieces. R§ 319, which is apparendy the missing top right-hand corner of IV AB, contains a graphic account of sexual intercourse between Baal and Anath; and IV AB itself is suggestive of something more than platonic relations between the two. This is entirely at variance with the epic, as everyone will realize who has read the former without reading into it.

The Legend of King Keret
In the campaigns of 1930 and 1931 the French excavators of ancient Ugarit recovered fragments belonging to three day tablets of an epic about a king designated by a name whose consonants are \-r-t and whose vowels are unknown; it is conventionally transcribed Keret. There are six columns of writing (three on each side) on each tablet. According to the order in which they were published, they are designated as I K, II K, and III K, but according to their organic sequence as K R T A ( = I K ) , K R T B ( = III K ) , K R T C ( = 11 K ) . K R T A was probably preceded, and K R T C was certainly followed, by one or more lost tablets. There may also be one or more missing between B and C. Our text was copied in the reign of a certain king of Ugarit by the name of Niqmadd (see the colophon at the end of K R T C ) , who is known to have reigned in the second quarter of the fourteenth century B.C. That it contains a certain core of history is probable. First publication: Of K R T A (with copies and photographs of the original), Ch.

... The house of [a k]ing is destroyed,
Who had seven [brejthren, Eight mother's sons.
Keret in offspring is ruined, (10)
Keret is undermined of establishment.
His lawful wife he did find,
His legitimate spouse.
He married the woman, and she "departed."2 Flesh of J{inship had he:
One-third died in healthy
One-fourth of sickness;
One-fifth pestilence gathered unto itself,
One-sixth calamity; One-seventh thereof fell by the sword.3— (20)
He sees his offspring, doth Keret;
He sees his offspring ruined,
Wholly undermined his seat,
And in its entirety a posterity perishing,
And in its totality a succession.
(So) he enters his cubicle (and) weeps, An inner chamber and cries.
His tears do drop Like shekels to the ground. His bed is soaked by his weeping,4 (30)
And he falls asleep as he cries.
Sleep prevails over him, and he lies; Slumber, and he reclines.
And in his dream El descends,
In his vision the Father of Man.5
And he approaches asking Keret:
"What ails Keret that he weeps,
The Beloved, Lad of El," that he cries ? (40)
Is it a kingship like Bull his father's he desires,
Or authority like the Father of Man's ?"

El is also frequently called "Creator of Creatures." 6 This epithet, like "Servant of E l " (below, 11. 153, 155, 299), has the connotations of "favorite" and "intimate." cf.

If K R T C is the direct continuation of K R T B, these 40 lines certainly indicated that Keret was ill, and that the opening lines of K R T C were what his son Elhau (ilhu) was advised—perhaps by his own heart (cf.

Also, the passing of the years which presumably elapsed between the 7th year of Keret's marriage (above, iii 20-25) a n d the apparent maturity of Elhau and Thitmanet as well as Yassib is more likely to have been indicated in this lacuna than in any of the preceding ones.)

And Keret the Noble answers: "My son, weep not for me, Do thou not wail for me. Waste not thine eye with flowing, The brain in thy head with tears.

Straightway the youth Elhau His [l]ance in his hand doth take, His [s]pear in his right hand, And setteth out on a run. [Ev]en as he arrives, it grows dark: (50) His sister's gone out to draw water.

Baal is the god of rain; cf. p. 153. 41 All this certainly sounds more like the end of a drought (or dry season) than the beginning or middle of one, yet Keret is still ill.

Death, on the one hand, is broken; Sha'taqat, on the other, has prevailed.Then Keret the Noble commands, Raising his voice and crying: "Hearken, O Lady Hurriya. Prepare a lamb that I may eat, A yeanling that I may dine." Lady Hurriya hearkens. She prepares a lamb and he eats, (20) A yeanling and he dines. Behold a day and a second, Keret returns to his former estate; He sits upon the throne of kingship; Upon the dais, the seat of authority. Now, Yassib sits in the palace, And his inward parts do instruct him: "Go unto thy father, Yassib; Go unto thy fa[ther] and speak, Repeat unto Ke[ret the Noble]: List and incline [thine ear].

List and incline thine ear. (here again the unintelligible couplet) Thou hast let thy hand fall into mischief. Thou judgest not the cause of the widow, Nor adjudicat'st the case of the wretched; Driv'st not out them that prey on the poor; Feed'st not the fatherless before thee, The widow behind thy back.36 (50) Having become a brother of the sickbed, A companion of the bed of suffering, Descend from the kingship—I'll reign; From thine authority—I'll sit enthroned."And [K]eret the Noble makes answer: "May Horon37 break, O my son, May Horon break thy head, Ashtoreth name of Baal thy pate.

The Tale of Aqhat
The rich epigraphic harvests of the French excavations of 1930 and 1931 at the site of ancient Ugarit included large portions of three tablets, and a possible fragment of a fourth, belonging to an epic about a youth whose name is spelled a-q-h-t and conventionally vocalized Aqhat. The text was at first called the Epic of Daniel, or Danel, for Aqhat's father; but on the one tablet of which the first line, containing the title of the composition to which the tablet belongs, is preserved, it reads "Pertaining to 'Aqhat,'" and closer study reveals that the text really tells about Daniel only what concerns Aqhat. According to the order in which they were originally published, which is the descending order of magnitude, the three tablets are referred to as I D, II D, and III D (D = Daniel), or I Aqh(a)t, II Aqh(a)t, and III Aqh(a)t; but in accordance with their organic sequence they will be designated herein as A Q H T A ( = 11 D ) , A Q H T B ( = 1 1 1 D ) , and A Q H T C ( = I D ) . A Q H T A originally counted 3 columns on each side, but the part containing col. iii on the obverse and col. iv on the reverse is missing entirely; A Q H T B apparendy contains parts of the first and last columns of a four-column tablet; while A Q H T C is an almost complete tablet of four columns. Part of the colophon of A Q H T A is preserved, and enables us to date its copying in the same period as that of "The Legend of King Keret," namely about the second quarter of the fourteenth century B.C. (see below, n.26). The story borders on the mythical, and seems to have less of a historical core than that of Keret. There is a considerable probability that Aqhat's father, Daniel, is the ancient saint and sage of that name to whom the prophet Ezekiel refers in Ezek. 14:14, 20; 28:3.

1 T h e name means "God judges." Judging the cause of the widow and the fatherless is Daniel's special concern; see v 4-8 etc. His wife's name, Danatiya (v 16, 22), is from the same root. 2 This Rapha is perhaps identical with the aboriginal giant race of Canaan; II Sam. 21:16, 18, 20, 22; cf. Gen. 14:5; D e u t 2:11, 20; 3:11, 13 etc. 8 As a common noun, gzr means "boy." 4 Perhaps connected with Hrnm, a Syrian locality named in an early Egyptian source; see p. 477 (Harnaim).

Surely there's a son for him r like1 his brethren's, And a scion like unto his kindred's! He gives oblation to the gods to eat, Oblation to drink to the holy ones.

So shall there be a son in his house,6 A scion in the midst of his palace: Who sets up the stelae of his ancestral spirits, In the holy place the protectors of his clan; Who frees his spirit from the earth, From the dust guards his footsteps; Who smothers the life-force of his detractor, (30) Drives off who attacks his abode;7 Who takes him by the hand when he's drunk, Carries him when he's sated with wine;8 Consumes his funerary offering in Baal's house, (Even) his portion in El's house; Who plasters his roof when it leaks, Washes his clothes when they're soiled."[By the hand] El takes his servant, Blessing Daniel the Rapha-man, Beatifying Ghazir the Harnamiyy-man: "With life-breath shall be quickened Daniel the Raphaman, With spirit Ghazir the Harnamiyy-man. [With life-breath] he is invigorated.9

A]sk for silver, and I'll give it thee; [For gold, and I'll be]stow't on thee; But give thou thy bow [to me; Let] Yabamat-Liimmim21 take thy darts" But Aqhat the Youth answers: (20) "/ vow yew trees of Lebanon,

Give (these) to Kothar wa-Khasis. He'll make a bow for thee, Darts for Yabamat-Liimmim."22 Then quoth the Maiden Anath: "Ask for life, O Aqhat the Youth. Ask for life and I'll give it thee, For deathlessness, and I'll bestow't on thee. I'll make thee count years with Baal, With the sons of El shalt thou count months.24 And Baal when he gives life gives a feast, (30) Gives a feast to the life-given and bids him drink; Sings and chants over him, Sweetly serenades] him: So give I life to Aqhat the Youth." But Aqhat the Youth answers: "Fib not to me, O Maiden; For to a Youth thy fibbing is loathsome. Further life—how can mortal attain it? How can mortal attain life enduring? Glaze will be poured [on] my head, Plaster upon my pate;24 And I'll die as everyone dies, I too shall assuredly die. Moreover, this will I say:

"First" may mean "choicest" here. 21 An alternative designation of the Maiden Anath; meaning doubtful. 22 Yew-wood, horn, sinew, and tendon go into the making of a composite bow; reed into that of arrows. 24 i.e. shalt be immortal like them. 24 My hair will turn white.

And comes to the city of Abelim, Abelim the city of Prince Yarikh.42 He lifts up his voice and cries: "Woe to thee, city of Abelim, On which rests the blood-guilt of Aqhat the Youth! May Baal make thee blind From now for evermore, From now unto all generations!" Again he waves the staff of his hand. Daniel goes to his house, (170) To his palace Daniel betakes him. Into his palace come weeping-women, Wailing-women into his court Pzgm gr He weeps for Aqhat the Youth, Cries for the child, does Daniel the Rapha-man. From days to months, from months to years, Until seven years, He weeps for Aqhat the Youth, Cr[ie]s for the child, does Daniel the [Rapha]-man. But after seven years, (180) [Daniel] the Rapha-[man] speaks up, Ghazir [the Harnamiyy-m ]an makes answer. [He] lifts up his voice and cries: "De[part], weeping-women, from my pala[ce]; Wailing-women, from my court Pzgm gr."He ta[kes] a sacrifice for the gods, Offers up a clan-offering to heaven, The clan-offering of Harnamiyy to the stars, (three and one-half lines mutilated) Quoth Paghat who observes the flowing water: (190) "Father has sacrificed to the gods, Has offered up a clan-offering to heaven, The clan-offering of Harnamiyy to the stars.

EPICS, AND LEGENDS






II. Legal Texts






Collections of Laws from Mesopotamia
and Asia Minor
Lipit-Ishtar Lawcode
(Translator: S. N. Kramer)
Like the Hammurabi Code, that of Lipit-Ishtar consists of three main sections: a Prologue; the legal text proper consisting of a large number of laws introduced by a Sumerian complex which is roughly the equivalent of the English word " i f ' ; an Epilogue. T h e Prologue begins with a statement by King LipitIshtar, the fifth ruler of the Dynasty of Isin, that after the leading Sumero-Babylonian deities Anu and Enlil had given the goddess Ninisinna1 a favorable reign in her city Isin, and after they had called him, Lipit-Ishtar, "to the princeship of the land" in order "to bring well-being to the Sumerians and the A k kadians," he established justice in Sumer and Akkad. He then cites some of his achievements in regard to the welfare of his subjects: he freed "the sons and daughters of Sumer and Akkad" from slaveship which had been imposed upon them; he reestablished equitable family practices. The end of the Prologue unfortunately is destroyed; so, too, is the beginning of the legal text proper.
As for the legal body of the Lipit-Ishtar Code, the available text permits the restoration, wholly or in part, of some thirtyeight laws; practically all belong to the second half of the code, the first half being almost entirely destroyed. The subject matter treated in these laws is as follows: hiring of boats (laws 4 and 5); real estate, particularly orchards (laws 7-11); slaves and perhaps servants (laws 12-17); defaulting of taxes (law 18 and probably 19); inheritance and marriage (laws 20-33); rented oxen (34-37). Immediately following the last of the thirtyeight laws extant wholly or in part, follows the Epilogue; because of the numerous breaks in the text, the latter is only partially intelligible. It begins with a reiteration by Lipit-Ishtar that he established justice in the land, and that he brought well-being to its people. He then states that he had set up "this stela," that is the stela on which the original code was inscribed,2 and proceeds to bless those who will not damage it in any way, and to curse those who will.
The text of the code is reconstructed from seven clay tablets and fragments. Four of these are "excerpt tablets," that is, they are one- or two-column tablets which did not contain the entire code, but only small parts of it excerpted for scribal purposes. The remaining three pieces are all parts of a large, probably twenty-column tablet, which in its original state had contained the entire lawcode, including Prologue and Epilogue. Six of the seven tablets and fragments were excavated at Nippur and are now in the University Museum; one, of unknown provenience, is in the Louvre. All seven pieces date from the Early PostSumerian period, that is, they were actually inscribed sometime in the first half of the second millennium B.C. AS for the first compilation of the code, it must have taken place sometime during the eleven-year reign of Lipit-Ishtar, who ruled probably during the first half of the nineteenth century B.C.; it thus antedates the Hammurabi Code by more than a century and a
1 Ninisinna, "Queen of Isin," is the tutelary deity of Isin, just as Marduk was that of Babylon. 2 The contents of our "code" tablet may be presumed to be identical with those of the original stela on which a scene similar to that on the Hammurabi stela may have been sculptured.

Steele in A]A, LII (1948), pp. 425-450; there, too, the relevant earlier studies are cited;* the present translation follows the Steele publication throughout.

1 Abu Harmal formed part of the kingdom of Eshnunna—the Diyala region east of Baghdad—which flourished between the downfall of the Third Dynasty of Ur (about 2000 B.C.) and the creation of Hammurabi's empire. Eshnunna was one of the numerous Amurrite-controlled states of the period. The city of Eshnunna itself is located at Tell Asmar which was excavated by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. 2 The sign encountered here looks like the ideogram for "salt." * Possibly " ( w h o finds himself) in great peril."

* The last two sentences are rather uncertain. 5 T h e mul\cnum is a member of a social class which at Eshnunna seems to be closely connected with the palace or the temple. 6 The undeciphered word must denote some kind of "money-lender" or "merchant." 7 The official "finance officer" who has a state monopoly on certain commercial transactions. 8 The woman to whom trade in liquor is entrusted.

The Code of Hammurabi
(Translator: Theophile J. Meek)
Hammurabi (also spelled Hammurapi) was the sixth of eleven kings in the Old Babylonian (Amorite) Dynasty. He ruled for 43 years, from 1728 to 1686 according to the most recent calculations.1 The date-formula for his second year, "The year he enacted the law of the land," indicates that he promulgated his famous lawcode at the very beginning of his reign, but the copy which we have could not nave been written so early because the Prologue refers to events much later than this. Our copy was written on a diorite stela, topped by a bas-relief showing Hammurabi in the act of receiving the commission to write the lawbook from the god of justice, the sun-god Shamash. The stela

was carried off to the old Elamite capital, Susa (the Shushan of Esther and Daniel), by some Elamite raider (apparently Shutruk-Nahhunte, about 1207-1171 в.с.) as a trophy of war. It was discovered there by French archaeologists in the winter of 1901-1902 and was carried off by them to the Louvre in Paris as a trophy of archaeology. All the laws from col. xvi 77 to the end of the obverse (from the end of §65 to the beginning of §100) were chiseled off by the Elamites, but these have been preserved in large part on other copies of the Code. The Prologue and Epilogue are written in semi-poetic style, marked by parallelism but not by regular metrical structure. The original stela was published by V. Scheil, Memoir еs de la delegation en Perse, iv (1902), 11 ff. The best edition of the Code in all its known copies is A. Deimel, Codex Hammurabi (1930; 3rd ed. by E. Bergmann, 1953). The English edition by R. F. Harper, The Code of Hammurabi (1904), includes only the stela, and its translation is naturally antiquated. The best translation is that by Wilhelm Eilers, AO, xxxi (1931), Heft 3/4. The latest and quite exhaustive commentary is G. R. Driver and John C. Miles, The Babylonian Laws, 1, Legal Commentary (1952), which is to be followed by a translation in Vol. 11. A tablet containing a slighdy variant copy of the Prologue has been published by J. Nougayrol, RA, XLV (1951), 67-79. The present translation, like that of the following legal texts, is much influenced by two articles: A. Goetze, The t-Form of the Old Babylonian Verb, J AOS, LVI (1936), 297-334, AND T. J. Meek, The Asyndeton Clause in the Code of Hammurabi, JNES, v (1946), 64-72.

2 The sky-god, the leader of the pantheon, worshiped especially in the temple of Eanna in Uruk along with the goddess Inanna. 3 In this inscription the Anunnaki are the lesser gods attendant upon Anum and the Igigi are the lesser gods attendant on Enlil. 4 The storm-god, the chief executive of the pantheon, worshiped especially in the temple of Ekur in Nippur in central Babylonia, modern Nuffar. 5 T h e son of Enki and consort of Sarpanit; the god of Babylon and in Hammurabi's time the god of the Babylonian Empire with the functions of Enlil delegated to him; worshiped especially in the temple of Esagila in Babylon. e L o r d of the earth and the mass of life-giving waters within it, issuing in streams and fountains; the father of Marduk; worshiped especially in the temple of Eabzu in Eridu, in southern Babylonia, modern Abu Shahrein. 7 Lit., "to make good the flesh of the people." 8 The late-Sumerian expression for men in general.

The city was captured by Hammurabi in the 30th year of his reign and its powerful dynasty brought to an end with the dethronement of its king, Rim-Sin. This event is set down as the formula for Hammurabi's 31st year, but the formula for the year always comes from an event in the preceding year; hence our yearnumbers will be one less than those generally given. 18 An ancient and important city in southern Babylonia, the biblical Erech (Gen. 10:10), modern Warka, conquered by Hammurabi in the 6th year of his reign. It was the cult-center of Anum and Inanna, with its temple Eanna. 14 A city south of Nippur in southern Babylonia, conquered by Rim-Sin of Larsa in his 29th year, and then by Hammurabi in the 6th year of his reign. It was the cult-center of Ninkarrak, with its temple Egalmah. 15 A form of Ninurta, worshiped especially in the temple of Emete-ursag in Kish, northeast of Babylon, modern Tell eT-Oheimir.

The Laws
i: If a seignior39 accused a(nother) seignior and brought a charge of murder against him, but has not proved it, his accuser shall be put to death.40 2: If a seignior brought a charge of sorcery against a(nother) seignior, but has not proved it, the one against whom the charge of sorcery was brought, upon going to the river,41 shall throw himself into the river, and if the river has then overpowered him, his accuser shall take over his estate; if the river has shown that seignior to be innocent and he has accordingly come forth safe, the one who brought the charge of sorcery against him shall be put to death, while the one who threw himself into the river shall take over the estate of his accuser. 3: If a seignior came forward with false testimony in a case, and has not proved the word which he spoke, if that case was a case involving life, that seignior shall be put to death. 4: If he came forward with (false) testimony concerning grain or money, he shall bear the penalty of that case. 5: If a judge gave a judgment, rendered a decision, deposited a sealed document, but later has altered his judgment, they shall prove that that judge altered the judgment which he gave and he shall pay twelvefold the claim which holds in that case; furthermore, they shall expel him in the assembly from his seat of judgment and he shall never again sit42 with the judges in a case. 6: If a seignior stole the property of church or state,43 that seignior shall be put to death; also the one who received the stolen goods from his hand shall be put to death. 7: If a seignior has purchased or he received for safekeeping either silver or gold or a male slave or a female slave or an ox or a sheep or an ass or any sort of thing from the hand of a seignior's son or a seignior's slave without witnesses and contracts, since that seignior is a thief, he shall be put to death. 8: If a seignior stole either an ox or a sheep or an ass or a pig or a boat, if it belonged to the church (or) if it belonged to the state, he shall make thirtyfold restitu
8 9 T h e word atuelum, used here, is literally "man," but in the legal literature it seems to be used in at least three senses: ( 1 ) sometimes to indicate a man of the higher class, a noble; (2) sometimes a free man of any class, high or low; and (3) occasionally a man of any class, from king to slave (see, e.g. C H , reverse xxvi, 39-44). For the last I use the inclusive word "man," but for the first two, since it is seldom clear which of the two is intended in a given context, I follow the ambiguity of the original and use the rather general term "seignior," which I employ as the term is employed in Italian and Spanish, to indicate any free man of standing, and not in the strict feudal sense, although the ancient Near East did have something approximating the feudal system, and that is another reason for using "seignior." 40 With this law and the three following cf. Deut. 5:20; 19:16 ff.; Exod. 23:1-3· 41 The word for "river" throughout this section has the determinative of deity, indicating that the river (the Euphrates) as judge in the case was regarded as god. 42 Lit., "he shall not return and sit." 43 Lit., "the property of god or palace."
tion; if it belonged to a private citizen,44 he shall make good tenfold. If the thief does not have sufficient to make restitution, he shall be put to death.48 9: When a seignior, (some of) whose property was lost, has found his lost property in the possession of a(nother) seignior, if the seignior in whose possession the lost (property) was found has declared, "A seller sold (it) to me; I made the purchase in the presence of witnesses," and the owner of the lost (property) in turn has declared, "I will produce witnesses attesting to my lost (property)"; the purchaser having then produced the seller who made the sale to him and the witnesses in whose presence he made the purchase, and the owner of the lost (property) having also produced the witnesses attesting to his lost (property), the judges shall consider their evidence, and the witnesses in whose presence the purchase was made, along with the witnesses attesting to the lost (property), shall declare what they know in the presence of god, and since the seller was the thief, he shall be put to death, while the owner of the lost (property) shall take his lost (property), with the purchaser obtaining from the estate of the seller the money that he paid out.46 10: If the (professed) purchaser has not produced the seller who made the sale to him and the witnesses in whose presence he made the purchase, but the owner of the lost property has produced witnesses attesting to his lost property, since the (professed) purchaser was the thief, he shall be put to death, while the owner of the lost property shall take his lost property. 11: If the (professed) owner of the lost property has not produced witnesses attesting to his lost property, since he was a cheat and started a false report, he shall be put to death. 12: If the seller has gone to (his) fate, the purchaser shall take from the estate of the seller fivefold the claim for that case. 13: If the witnesses of that seignior were not at hand, the judges shall set a time-limit of six months for him, and if he did not produce his witnesses within six months, since that seignior was a cheat, he shall bear the penalty of that case. 14: If a seignior has stolen the young son of a(nother) seignior, he shall be put to death.47 15: If a seignior has helped either a male slave of the state or a female slave of the state or a male slave of a
4 4 T h e word is mus\enum, which in the Code ordinarily indicates a man of the middle class, a commoner, but here and in §§15, 16, 175, and 176 it manifestly refers to a private citizen as distinct from the church and state. 45 The laws on theft in the Code (556-13, 22, 23, 25, 259, 260, 265) do not agree among themselves, indicating that we have laws of different dates in the Code. According to the earliest laws (§§7, 9, 10, 22, 25) theft was to be punished by death; later (§6) the death penalty was confined to the theft of church or state property; later still severalfold restitution (§§8, 265) or a fine (§$259, 260) came to be substituted for the death penalty; see T. J. Meek, Hebrew Origins (1936), pp. 61 f. For the Hebrew laws on theft see Exod. 20:15 ( = Deut. 5:19); 22:1-4; Lev. 19:11, 13. 46 Lit., "he weighed out." In the time of Hammurabi coinage had of course not yet been invented and the money (usually silver, as here) was weighed out in bars. 47 cf. Exod. 21:16; Deut. 24:7.

THE EPILOGUE
(reverse xxiv)
The laws of justice, which Hammurabi, the efficient king, set up, and by which he caused the land to take the right way and have good government.
I, Hammurabi, the perfect king, (10) was not careless (or) neglectful of the black-headed (people), whom Enlil had presented to me, (and) whose shepherding Marduk had committed to me; I sought out peaceful regions for them; I overcame grievous difficulties; (20)

I caused light to rise on them. With the mighty weapon which Zababa and Inanna entrusted to me, with the insight that Enki allotted to me, with the ability that Marduk gave me, I rooted out the enemy above and below; (30) I made an end of war; I promoted the welfare of the land; I made the peoples rest in friendly habitations; I did not let them have anyone to terrorize them. The great gods called me, (40) so I became the beneficent shepherd whose scepter is righteous; my benign shadow is spread over my city. In my bosom I carried the peoples of the land of Sumer and Akkad; (50) they prospered under my protection; I always governed them in peace; I sheltered them in my wisdom. In order that the strong might not oppress the weak, (60) that justice might be dealt the orphan (and) the widow, in Babylon, the city whose head Anum and Enlil raised aloft, in Esagila, the temple whose foundations stand firm like heaven and earth, I wrote my precious words on my stela, and in the presence of the statue of me, the king of justice, I set (it) up in order to administer the law of the land, (70) to prescribe the ordinances of the land, to give justice to the oppressed.
I am the king who is preeminent among kings; (80) my words are choice; my ability has no equal. By the order of Shamash, the great judge of heaven and earth, may my justice prevail in the land; by the word of Marduk, my lord, (90) may my statutes have no one to rescind them;
(reverse xxv)
in Esagila, which I love, may my name be spoken in reverence forever!
Let any oppressed man who has a cause come into the presence of the statue of me, the king of justice, and then read carefully my inscribed stela, (10) and give heed to my precious words, and may my stela make the case clear to him; may he understand his cause; may he set his mind at ease! "Hammurabi, the lord, (20) who is like a real father to the people, bestirred himself for the word of Marduk, his lord, and secured the triumph of Marduk above and below, (30)
162
thus making glad the heart of Marduk, his lord, and he also ensured prosperity for the people forever, and led the land aright"let him proclaim this, (40) and let him pray with his whole heart for me in the presence of Marduk, my lord, and Sarpanit, my lady! May the guardian spirit, the protecting genius, the gods who enter Esagila, (and) Lebettum"8 of Esagila, (50) prosper the wishes (made) daily in the presence of Marduk, my lord, (and) Sarpanit, my lady!
In the days to come, for all time, (60) let the king who appears in the land observe the words of justice which I wrote on my stela; let him not alter the law of the land which I enacted, the ordinances of the land which I prescribed; (70) let him not rescind my statutes! If that man has intelligence and is able to guide his land aright, let him heed the words which I wrote on my stela, and may this stela show him the road (and) the way, (80) the law of the land which I enacted, the ordinances of the land which I prescribed; and let him guide aright his black-headed (people)! Let him enact the law for them; (90) let him prescribe the ordinances for them! Let him root out the wicked and the evil from his land; let him promote the welfare of his people!
I, Hammurabi, am the king of justice, to whom Shamash committed law. My words are choice; my deeds have no equal; (100) it is only to the fool that they are empty;
(reverse xxvi)
to the wise they stand forth as an object of wonder. If that man heeded my words which I wrote on my stela, and did not rescind my law, has not distorted my words, did not alter my statutes, (10) may Shamash make that man reign as long as I, the king of justice; may he shepherd his people in justice!
If that man did not heed my words which I wrote on my stela, (20) and disregarded my curses, and did not fear the curses of the gods, but has abolished the law which I enacted, has distorted my words, (30) has altered my statutes,

predicting157 the uprooting of the foundations of his kingdom, and also the ruin of his land! (30) May the blighting word of Shamash come upon him quickly; above, may he cut him off from among the living; below, in the underworld, may he cause his shade to thirst for water! (40)
May Sin, the lord of heaven, my divine creator, whose chastening stands conspicuous among the gods, deprive him of the crown (and) throne of sovereignty! May he lay upon him heavy guilt as his great punishment, which will not depart from his life, (50) and may he bring the days, months (and) years of his reign to an end in woe and lamentation! May he multiply for him the burdens of sovereignty; may he determine as the fate for him a life that is constantly wrestling with death! (60)
May Adad, the lord of abundance, the irrigator of heaven and earth, my helper, deprive him of the rains from heaven (and) the floodwaters from the springs! (70) May he bring his land to destruction through want and hunger; may he thunder furiously over his city, and turn his land into the desolation of a flood! (80)
May Zababa, the mighty warrior, the first-born son of Ekur,158 who marches at my right hand, shatter his weapons on the field of battle! May he turn day into night for him, and let his enemy trample upon him! (90)
May Inanna, the lady of batde and conflict, who bares my weapons, my gracious protecting genius, the admirer of my reign, curse his rule with her great fury in her wrathful heart! (!oo) May she turn his good into evil;

May Nergal,189 the strong one among the gods, the fighter without peer, who achieves victory for me, burn his people in his great power, (30) like the raging fire of swamp-reeds! May he cut him off with his powerful weapons, and break his body in pieces like an earthen image!
May Nintu, the exalted mistress of the lands, (40) the mother who bore me, deny him an heir; may she not let him receive a name or beget a male descendant in the midst of his people!

May the mighty gods of heaven and earth, (70) the Annunaki in their totality, the guardian spirit of the temple, (and) Lebettum of Ebabbar, curse him, his descendants, his land, his warriors, his people, and his nation, with a foul curse! (80)
May Enlil, by his word which cannot be altered, curse him with these181 curses, and may they come upon him quickly! (90)
The Middle Assyrian Laws
(Translator: Theophile J. Meek)
The Middle Assyrian Laws are preserved to us, not on a stela as in the case of Hammurabi's laws, but on clay tablets, some of which are unfortunately badly broken, and the lacunae have not as yet been filled. The tablets were unearthed by German archaeologists in the course of their extensive excavation of ancient Ashur, modern Qal'at Shergat, from 1903 to the spring of 1914. The tablets themselves date from the time of Tiglathpileser I in the 12th century B.C., but the laws on them may go back to the 15th century. The texts were published by Otto Schroeder, KAV, supplemented later by five fragments published and translated by Ernst F. Weidner in AfO, xn (1937), 50 £f. The most elaborate treatment of the former texts is G. R. Driver and John C. Miles, The Assyrian Laws, Edited with Translation and Commentary (1935), where the extensive literature is cited in full. Driver's translation is one of the best and is far superior to that by D. D. Luckenbill and F. W. Geers in J. M. P. Smith, The Origin and
1 8 9 The god of the underworld, whose cult-center was Kutha in northern Babylonia. 1 6 0 A form of Gula, a goddfcss of healing, worshiped particularly at Isin.

History of Hebrew Law (1931)· In the present translation Tablets C and G of the Driver-Miles edition are joined and Tablets D, H, and J are omitted altogether since it is now recognized that they do not belong here. The restoration of parts of Tablets C,-f- G, M, and F follows closely that of M. David in Symbolae ad iura orientis antiqui pertinentes Paulo Koschatter dedicatae (1939), pp. 121 ££. Tablet K and the first part of Tablet L are hortatory in character and hence probably constituted the introduction to the laws, like the hortatory introduction to the laws in Deuteronomy,

Also, if the wife of a seignior, whose husband is alive, has stolen (something) from her husband's house (and) has given (it) cither to a seignior or to a lady or to anyone else, the seignior shall prosecute his wife and inflict the (proper) punishment; also the receiver who received (it) from the hand of the seignior's wife shall give up the stolen (property) and they shall inflict on the receiver the same punishment that the seignior inflicted on his wife. 4: If either a male slave or a female slave has received something (stolen) from the hand of a seignior's wife, they shall cut off the nose (and) ears of the male or female slave, thus compensating for the stolen (property), while the seignior shall cut off his wife's ears. However, if he lets his wife go free, without cutting off her ears, they shall not cut off those of the male or female slave and so they shall not compensate for the stolen (property).
5: If a seignior's wife has stolen something from another seignior's house, exceeding the value of five minas of lead, the owner of the stolen (property) shall swear, "I never let her take (it); there was a theft from my house," if her husband (so) desires, he may give up the stolen (property) and ransom her (but) cut off her ears. If her husband does not wish to ransom her, the owner of the stolen (property) shall take her and cut off her nose.

However, if he let his wife go free, they shall let the seignior go free. 16: If a seignior [has lain with a(nother) seignior's] wife at her invitation,7 no blame attaches to the seignior; the (married) seignior shall inflict such punishment on his wife as he thinks fit.

However, if the woman's husband does nothing to his adulterous wife, they shall do nothing to the adulterer or the procuress; they shall let them go free. However, if the seignior's wife did not know (the situation), but the woman who brought her into her house brought the man to her under pressure and he has lain with her, if when she left the house she has declared that she was ravished, they shall let the woman go free, since she is guiltless; they shall put the adulterer and procuress to death.

However, if the man in whose house the (other) man's wife was staying has turned back from the river, he shall pay the (extra) third; if the seignior whose wife deserted him has turned back from the river, he is quit since he fulfilled the total (requirement) for the river (ordeal). However, if the seignior whose wife deserted him does not cut off (the ears of) his wife (and) takes her back, there is no punishment at all.18

34: If a seignior has married a widow, without sealing (it) with a contract, (and) she has lived in his house for two years, she becomes a wife; she need not leave. 35: If a widow has entered a seignior's house (as wife), anything at all that she brings becomes wholly her husband's; however, if the seignior has come in with the woman, anything at all that he brings becomes wholly the woman's. 36: If a woman is still living in her father's house or her husband made her live apart and her husband has gone off to the fields, without leaving her either oil or wool or clothing or food or anything at all (and) without having even an ear of grain brought to her from the field, that woman shall remain true to her husband for five years (and) not go to live with a(nother) husband. If she has sons (and) they hire themselves out and earn their living, the woman shall wait for her husband (and) not go to live with a(nother) husband. If she has no sons, she shall wait for her husband for five years; on the advent of the sixth year she may go to live with the man of her choice; her husband upon coming back may not claim her; she is free for her later husband. If upon coming back he can prove that he was delayed beyond the period of five years (and) did not keep himself away of his own accord, since either an adversary20 seized him and he had to flee or he was seized as a miscreant and so has been delayed, he shall give a woman equivalent to his wife and take back his wife. However, if the king has sent him to another country (and) he has been delayed beyond the period of five years, his wife shall wait for him (and) not go to live with a(nother) husband. However, if she has gone to live with a(nother) husband before the five years and has also borne children, her husband upon coming back shall get her back and her children as well because she did not respect the marriage-contract but got married.
37: If a seignior wishes to divorce his wife, if it is his will, he may give her something; if it is not his will, he need not give her anything; she shall go out empty. 38: If a woman is still living in her father's house and her husband has divorced her, he may take back the ornaments which he himself bestowed on her; he may not claim the marriage-price which he brought since it is vested in the woman. 39: If a seignior has given one not his daughter to a husband, if, her father being previously in debt (and) she made to live as a pledge, the earlier creditor has come forward, he shall be reimbursed for the value of the woman by the one who gave the woman (in marriage); if he has nothing to give, the seignior shall take the one who gave (her in marriage); but, if she was treated with cruelty, she is quit of the one who (so) treated her. However, if the seignior who became the husband of the woman, whether they have induced him to write a tablet or they have received a guarantee from him,

makes restitution for the value of the woman, then the one who gave (her in marriage) [is quit]. 40: Neither wives of seigniors nor [widows] nor [Assyrian women], who go out on the street [may have] their heads [uncovered]. The daughters of a seignior... whether it is a shawl or a robe or [a mantle\ must veil themselves; [they must not have] their heads [uncovered]. Whether . . . or . . . or .. . they must [not veil themselves, but] when they go out on the street alone, they must veil themselves. A concubine21 who goes out on the street with her mistress must veil herself. A sacred prostitute whom a man married must veil herself on the street, but one whom a man did not marry must have her head uncovered on the street; she must not veil herself. A harlot must not veil herself; her head must be uncovered; he who has seen a harlot veiled must arrest her,22 produce witnesses, (and) bring her to the palace tribunal;23 they shall not take her jewelry away, (but) the one who arrested her may take her clothing; they shall flog her fifty (times) with staves (and) pour pitch on her head. However, if a seignior has seen a harlot veiled and has let (her) go without bringing her to the palace tribunal, they shall flog that seignior fifty (times) with staves; his prosecutor shall take his clothing; they shall pierce his ears, thread (them) with a cord, (and) tie (it) at his back, (and) he shall do the work of the king for one full month. Female slaves must not veil themselves and he who has seen a female slave veiled must arrest her (and) bring her to the palace tribunal; they shall cut off her ears (and) the one who arrested her shall take her clothes. If a seignior has seen a female slave veiled and has let her go without arresting her (and) bringing her to the palace tribunal, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall flog him fifty (times) with staves; they shall pierce his ears, thread (them) with a cord, (and) tie (it) at his back; his prosecutor shall take his clothes (and) he shall do the work of the king for one full month.24 41: If a seignior wishes to veil his concubine, he shall have five (or) six of his neighbors present (and) veil her in their presence (and) say, "She is my wife," (and so) she becomes his wife. A concubine who was not veiled in the presence of the men, whose husband did not say, "She is my wife," is not a wife; she is still a concubine. If a seignior died (and) his veiled wife has no sons, the sons by concubines become (legitimate) sons; they shall receive a share (of the estate). 42: If a seignior poured oil on the head of a(nother) seignior's daughter on a holiday or brought betrothal

Hence those scholars are clearly wrong who say that apodictic law was unique and original with the Hebrews.

If the father died and the son to whom he assigned the wife also died, but the dead son has a son who is at least ten years old, he shall marry (her), but if the grandsons are younger than ten years, the girl's father, if he wishes, may give his daughter (to one of them); or if he wishes, he may make an equitable return (of the gifts). If there is no son, he shall return in full as much as he received, precious stones and whatever is not edible, but he need not return what is edible. 44: If there is an Assyrian man or if there is an Assyrian woman who is living in a seignior's house as a pledge for as much as his value (or) he was taken for the total value, when he deserves it, he (the seignior) may pull out (his hair); he may mutilate his ears by piercing (them). 45: When a woman has been given (in marriage) and the enemy has captured her husband, if she has no father-in-law and no son, she shall remain true to her husband for two years. During those two years, if she has not sufficient to live on, she shall come forward and (so) declare; she shall become a ward of the palace; her . . . shall support her (and) she shall do his work. [If she is the wife] of a peasant,. .. [shall support her (and) she shall do his work]. However, [if her husband held] a field and [a house as a fief in his city], she shall come forward [and say to the judges], ["I have nothing] to live on"; the judges shall inquire of the mayor (and) elders of the city (and) since he held a field in that city as a fief, they shall acquire the field and house for two years for her support (and) give (them) to her; she shall live (there) and they shall draw up her lease;25 she shall complete two years (and then) she may go to live with the husband of her choice, (and) they shall write a tablet for her as a widow. If in later days her missing husband has returned home,26 he may take back his wife who was married to an outsider; he may not claim the sons whom she bore to her later husband, but her later husband shall take (them). The field and house which were leased to an outsider at the total value as her support, if he did not re-enter the armed service of the king, he shall pay for and take over (on the same terms) as they were leased. However, if he has not returned (but) died in another land, the king shall allocate his field and house where he wishes to allocate (them). 46: If a woman whose husband died does not wish to leave her house on her husband's death, if her husband assigned her nothing in writing, she shall live in a house of her sons where she chooses; her husband's sons shall support her; they shall make a contract with her for

If she is a later (wife and) has no sons, she shall live with one (of her husband's sons, and) they shall support her in common; if she has sons (and) the sons of the earlier (wife) are not willing to support her, she shall live in a house of her own sons where she chooses; it is her own sons who shall support her and she shall do their work. However, if there was actually one among her husband's sons who married her, it is the one who married her [that shall support her]; her own sons need not support her. 47: If either a man or a woman made up magical preparations and they were found in their possession, when they have prosecuted them (and) convicted them, they shall put the maker of the magical preparations to death.27 The man who saw the making of the magical preparations (or) heard (of it) from the mouth of an eyewitness who declared to him, "I myself have seen (it)," shall come forward as an earwitness (and) so declare to the king; if the eyewitness has denied to the king what he said, he shall declare in the presence of the Bull-god, the son of Shamash, "He did indeed say (it)," (and then) he is quit. As for the eyewitness who made a statement and then denied (it), the king shall interrogate him as he is able (and) investigate his past; when the exorcist is brought, he shall make the man speak and he himself shall say, "He (the king) will not absolve you from the oath which you were made to swear to the king and his son; it is in accordance with the wording of the tablet which you were made to swear to the king and his son that you are sworn." 48: If a seignior, whose debtor's daughter is living in his house as (pledge for) a debt, asks her father, he may give her to a husband, (but) if her father is not willing, he may not give (her). If her father is dead, he shall ask one of her brothers and the latter shall speak to her (other) brothers; if a brother says, "I will redeem my sister within one full month," if he does not redeem her within one full month, the creditor, if he wishes, may declare her quit (of all claim and) give her to a husband.

However, if that woman died, they shall put the seignior to death; he shall compensate for her fetus with a life. But, when that woman's husband has no son, if someone struck her so that she had a miscarriage, they shall put the striker to death; even if her fetus is a girl, he shall compensate with a life.

T h e Hittite Laws
(Translator: Albrecht Goetze)
The laws, as they have come down to us, represent two tablets of a series called "If anyone." A label which is accidentally preserved ( A B o T , 52) proves that—possibly in a different arrangement—there existed a third tablet. The standard translation is now J. Friedrich, Die hethitischen Gesetze (Documenta et Monumenta Orientis Antiqui, vn, 1959). Note the critical reviews by H. G. Giiterbock, JCS, xv (1961), 62-78, xvi (1962), 17-23, and by A. Kammenhuber, Bi.Or., xvm (1961), 77-81, 124-27. Additional fragments not included by Friedrich appeared as KBo, XII, 48 and 49, and in AfO, xxi (1966), 1-12. Other independent translations were presented by the following authors: F. Hrozny, Code Hittite provenant de VAsie Mineure (1922); A. Walther in J.M.P. Smith, The Origin and History of Hebrew Law (1931), 246-79; E. Neufeld, The Hittite laws (1951) (with photos of almost all cuneiform texts);

If he is exempted by order of the palace, he shall not render the services. If anyone buys all the fields of a craftsman, they shall ask the king, and he shall render those services which the king orders.

Later version of 48: (It is virtually identical with the older version.) 49: If a hipparas man steals, there will be no compensation. If he is considered a felon, the community to which he belongs will make compensation. If one would indict them for theft, all of them were criminals or would have to be considered as thieves. Whether this (man) seize one (of them), or that (man) another, they would . . . (a penalty). 50: The people who live in Nerik, in Arinna (and) in Ziplanta, (and) the priests in every town—their houses (shall be) exempt. But their associates shall render the services. The house of a man who stays in Arinna for 11 months, and he at whose gate an eyan12 is erected, (shall be) free. 51: Formerly the house of a man who had become a weaver in Arinna (was) exempt, also his associates and his relations (were) exempt. Now (only) his own house (is) exempt, but his associates and his relations perform socage and render the services. In Zippalantiya it is just the same. 52: The slave of the seal-house, the slave of a royal prince (and) the master of a . . . who hold a field among craftsmen, render the services.

The Neo-Babylonian Laws
(Translator: Theophile J. Meek)
These laws are found on a tablet in the British Museum, published and translated by F. E. Peiser, SPAW, 1889, pp. 823

T h e tablet originally contained some sixteen paragraphs, of which only nine are well preserved. Peiser suggests a date in the time of Ashurbanipal, but what he regards as the remnants of a date is unquestionably a part of the legislation in §1. However, the script, orthography, and wording, all clearly indicate a date in the Neo-Babylonian Period.

Egyptian and Hittite Treaties
Egyptian Treaty
(Translator: John A. Wilson)
TREATY BETWEEN THE HITTITES AND EGYPT
The reign of Ramses II began in hostility against the Hittite state. However, by this pharaoh's twenty-first year (about 1280 B . C . ) , both powers were ready to conclude a treaty, so that they might turn their attention to other problems, such as the encroachments of the "Sea Peoples." The offensive and defensive alliance set forth in the following document mentions no effective frontier between the two empires. Perhaps there was no one firm line, but Egyptian hegemony was recognized in Palestine and southern Phoenicia, Hittite hegemony in Syria and northern Phoenicia. Since Akkadian was the diplomatic language of the day, the Egyptian text was a translation, edited to give greater prominence to the role of Egypt in granting peace. The Hittite version (pp. 201-203) was probably much closer to the text formally agreed upon, and the two versions should be read together. The Egyptian version was carved upon the walls of the Temple of Amon at Karnak and of the Ramesseum. The most satisfactory copy is by W. M. Miiller in MVAG, vn (1902), No. 5. The standard study, with a comparison of the cuneiform and hieroglyphic texts, was made by S. Langdon and A. H. Gardiner, in ]EA, vi (1920), 179-205. There is also a translation of the Egyptian in Breasted, AR, hi, §§367-391* (See Addenda).
Year 21, 1st month of the second season, day 21,1 under the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: User-maat-Re; Son of Re: Ramses Meri-Amon, given life forever, beloved of Amon-Re; Har-akhti; Ptah, South-of-His-Wall, Lord of Life of the Two Lands; Mut, the Lady of Ishru; and Khonsu Neferhotep; appearing on the Horus-Throne of the Living, 1 like his father Har-akhti forever and ever. [ On this day, while his majesty was in the town of I Per-Ramses Meri-Amon,2 doing the pleasure of his i father Amon-Re; Har-akhti; Atum, Lord of the Two Lands, the Heliopolitan; Amon of Ramses Meri-Amon ;2 Ptah of Ramses Meri-Amon;2 and [Seth], the Great of | Strength, the Son of Nut, according as they give him an eternity of jubilees and an infinity of years of peace, ; while all lands and all foreign countries are prostrate un! der his soles forever—there came the Royal Envoy and i Deputy . . . Royal Envoy .. . [User-maat-Re] Setep-en[Re] . . . [Tar]-Teshubf and the Messenger of Hatti, ! .. .-silis, carrying [the tablet of silver which] the Great j Prince of Hatti, Hattusilis [caused] to be brought to I Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health!—in order to beg j [peace from the majesty of User-maat-Re] Setep-en-Re, | the Son of Re: Ramses Meri-Amon, [given] life forever and ever, like his father Re every day.
1 Around 1280 B.C., this date would fall toward the end of November. 2 The capital city of Ramses in the Delta.
Copy of the tablet of silver which the Great Prince of Hatti, Hattusilis, caused to be brought to Pharaohlife, prosperity, health!—by the hand of his envoy (5) Tar-Teshub, and his envoy Ra-mose,3 in order to beg peace from the majesty of [User-maat-Re], Son of Re: Ramses Meri-Amon, the bull of rulers, who has made his frontier where he wished in very land.
Preamble
The regulations4 which the Great Prince of Hatti, Hattusilis, the powerful, the son of Mursilis, the Great Prince of Hatti, the powerful, the son of the son of Suppi[luliumas, the Great Prince of Hatti, the] powerful, made upon a tablet of silver for User-maat-Re, the great ruler of Egypt, the powerful, the son of Men-maatRe, the great ruler of Egypt, the powerful, the son of Men-pehti-Re,5 the great ruler of Egypt, the powerful; the good regulations of peace and of brotherhood, giving peace . . . forever.
Former Relations
Now from the beginning of the limits of eternity, as for the situation of the great ruler of Egypt with the Great Prince of Hatti, the god did not permit hostility to occur between them, through a regulation.6 But in the time of Muwatallis, the Great Prince of Hatti, my brother/ he fought with [Ramses Meri-Amon], the great ruler of Egypt. But hereafter, from this day, behold Hattusilis, the Great Prince of Hatti, [is under] a regulation for making permanent the situation which the Re and Seth8 made for the land of Egypt with the land of Hatti, in order not to permit hostility to occur between them forever.
The Present Treaty
Behold, Hattusilis, the Great Prince of Hatti, has set himself in a regulation with User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re, the great ruler of Egypt, beginning from this day, to cause that good peace and brotherhood occur between us forever, (10) while he is in brotherhood with me and he is at peace with me, and I am in brotherhood with him and I am at peace with him forever. Now since Muwatallis, the Great Prince of Hatti, my brother, went in pursuit of his fate,9 and Hattusilis sat as Great Prince of Hatti upon the throne of his father,
3 Tar-Teshub bears a Hittite name, Ra-mose in Egyptian name. However, in the broken context above, two Hittite names apppear. See E. Edel in JNES, VII (1948), 17-18. 4 The "prescribed form," used throughout this inscription for the treaty. 5 Ramses II, the son of Seti I, the son of Ramses I. 6 Reference to a previous treaty (in the reign of Hor-em-heb?). 1 Whose best-known encounter with Ramses II was at the Battle of Kadesh, 16 years earlier; cf. pp. 255-256 below. 8 Cuneiform version: "the Sun-god and the Storm-god." See n.15 below. 9 This is an example of the non-Egyptian language resulting from a translation of the cuneiform.



200 e g y p t i a n a n d h i t t i t e t r e a t i e s
behold, I have come to be with Ramses Meri-Amon, the great ruler of Egypt, for we are [together in] our peace and our brotherhood. It is better than the peace or the brotherhood which was formerly in the land. Behold, I, as the Great Prince of Hatti, am with [Ramses Meri-Amon], in good peace and in good brotherhood. The children of the children [of] the Great Prince of Hatti are in brotherhood and peace with the children of the children of [Ra]mses Meri-[Amon], the great ruler of Egypt, for they are in our situation of brotherhood and our situation [of peace. The land of EgyP*]> with land of Hatti, [shall be] at peace and in brotherhood like unto us forever. Hostilities shall not occur between them forever.
Mutual Renunciation of Invasion
The Great Prince of Hatti shall not trespass against the land of Egypt forever, to take anything from it. And User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re, the great ruler of Egypt, shall not trespass against the land [of Hatti, to take] from it forever.
Reaffirmation of Former Treaties
As to the traditional regulation10 which had been here in the time of Suppiluliumas, the Great Prince of Hatti, as well as the traditional regulation which had been in the time of Muwatallis,11 the Great Prince of Hatti, my father, I seize hold of it. Behold, Ramses Meri-Amon, the great ruler of Egypt, seizes hold of (15) [the regulation which he ma\es] together with us, beginning from this day. We seize hold of it, and we act in this traditional situation.
A Defensive Alliance—for Egypt
If another enemy come against the lands of Usermaat-Re, the great ruler of Egypt, and he send to the Great Prince of Hatti, saying: "Come with me as reinforcement against him," the Great Prince of Hatti shall [come to him and] the Great Prince of Hatti shall slay his enemy. However, if it is not the desire of the Great Prince of Hatti to go (himself), he shall send his infantry and his chariotry, and he shall slay his enemy. Or, if Ramses Meri-Amon, [the great ruler of Egypt], is enraged against servants belonging to him, and they commit another offence against him, and he go to slay them, the Great Prince of Hatti shall act with him [to slay] everyone [against whom] they shall be enraged.
A Defensive Alliance—for Hatti
But [if] another enemy [come] against the Great Prince [of Hatti, User]-maat-[Re] Setep-en-Re, [the great ruler of Egypt, shall] come to him as reinforcement to slay his enemy. If it is (not)12 the desire of Ramses Meri-Amon, the great ruler of Egypt, to come,

Extradition of Refugees to Egypt
[If a great man flee from the land of Egypt and come to] the Great Prince of Hatti, or a town belonging to the lands of Ramses Meri-Amon, the great ruler of Egypt, and they come to the Great Prince of Hatti, the Great Prince of Hatti shall not receive them. The Great Prince of Hatti shall cause them to be brought to Usermaat-Re Setep-en-Re, the great ruler of Egypt, their lord, [because] of it. Or if a man or two men—no matter who14—flee, and they come to the land of Hatti to be servants of someone else, they shall not be left in the land of Hatti; they shall be brought to Ramses MeriAmon, the great ruler of Egypt.
Extradition of Refugees to Hatti
Or if a great man flee from the land of Hatti and [come to User]-maat-[Re] Setep-en-Re, the [great] ruler of Egypt, or a town or a district or a . . . belonging to the land of Hatti, and they come to Ramses Meri-Amon, the great ruler of Egypt, (then) User-maat-Re Setep-enRe, the great ruler of Egypt, shall not receive them. Ramses Meri-Amon, the great ruler of Egypt, shall cause them to be brought to the Prince [of Haiti]. They shall not be left. Similarly, if a man or two men—(25) [no] matter who14—flee, and they come to the land of Egypt to be servants of other people, User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re, the great ruler of Egypt, shall not leave them. He shall cause them to be brought to the Great Prince of Hatti.
The Divine Witnesses to the Treaty
As for these words of the regulation [which] the Great Prince of Hatti [made] with Ramses [MeriAmon], the great ruler [of Egypt], in writing upon this tablet of silver—as for these words, a thousand gods of the male gods and of the female gods of them of the land of Hatti, together with a thousand gods of the male gods and of the female gods of them of the land of
13 The meaning of this section is uncertain, but it seems to provide that Ramses II shall take helpful action in the succession to the Hittite throne, if Hattusilis dies. If so, the reciprocal section about Egypt does not appear, cf. the Hittite version. 14 "They are unknown." The clause provides for the same treatment of individuals and of subject princes or subject states.

Curses and Blessings for this Treaty
As for these words which are on this tablet of silver of the land of Hatti and of the land of Egypt—as for him who shall not keep them, a thousand gods of the land of Hatti, together with a thousand gods of the land of Egypt, shall destroy his house, his land, and his servants. But, as for him who shall keep these words which are on this tablet of silver, whether they are Hatti or whether they are Egyptians, and they are not neglectful of them, a thousand gods of the land of Hatti, together with a thousand gods of the land of Egypt, shall cause that he be well, shall cause that he live, together with his houses and his (land) and his servants.
Extradition of Egyptians from Hatti
If a man flee from the land of Egypt—or two or threeand they come to the Great Prince of Hatti, the Great Prince of Hatti shall lay hold of them, and he shall cause that they be brought back to User-maat-Re Setepen-Re, the great ruler of Egypt. But, as for the man who shall be brought to Ramses Meri-Amon, the great ruler of Egypt, do not cause that his crime be raised against him; do not cause that his house or his wives or his children be destroyed; [do not cause that] he be [slain]; do not cause that injury be done to his eyes, to his ears, to his mouth, or to his legs; do not let any [crime be raised] against him.
1 5 L a n g d o n and Gardiner, op. cit., 194-97, show a number of the cuneiform originals of these Hittite deities. The present translation has profited by the suggestions of A. Goetze. For example, "the Re, the lord of the sky" from an original "the Sun-god, lord of heaven"; "the Re of the town of Arinna" from an original "the Sun-goddess of Arinna"; "Seth, lord of the sky" from an original "the Storm-god, lord of heaven"; etc. 16 Goetze believes that the formerly proposed emendation of this name to "Astarte" is impossible and that the original here had "the (patron god) of the Hatti land," with the ideogram DKAL, Hittite reading unknown but designating the patron god, hidden behind the curious Egyptian 'ntrt (fem.). 17 Goetze rules out the previously proposed "the goddess of Tyre," and suggests that we have here an Egyptian attempt to render a Hittite original, "the goddess of the field." He believes that the previous "the goddess of the town of Karahna" stems from an original "the (patron god) of Karahna," dKAL again. The present translation omits a broken context following this note.

Extradition of-Hittites from Egypt
Similarly, if men flee from the land of Hatti—whether he be one or two or three—and they come to User-maatRe Setep-en-Re, (35) the great ruler of Egypt, let Ramses Meri-Amon, the [great] ruler [of Egypt], lay hold [of them and cause] that they be brought to the Great Prince of Hatti, and the Great Prince of Hatti shall not raise their crime against them, and they shall not destroy his house or his wives or his children, and they shall not slay him, and they shall not do injury to his ears, to his eyes, to his mouth, or to his legs, and they shall not raise any crime against him.
Description of the Tablet
What is in the middle of the tablet of silver. On its front side: figures consisting of an image of Seth embracing an image of the Great Prince [of Hatti], surrounded by a border with the words: "the seal of Seth, the ruler of the sky; the seal of the regulation which Hattusilis made, the Great Prince of Hatti, the powerful, the son of Mursilis, the Great Prince of Hatti, the powerful." What is within that which surrounds the figures: the seal [of Seth. What is on] its other side: figures consisting of a female image of [the] goddess of Hatti embracing a female image of the Princess of Hatti, surrounded by a border with the words: "the seal of the Re of the town of Arinna, the lord of the land; the seal of Putu-hepa, the Princess of the land of Hatti, the daughter of the land of Kizuwadna, the [priestess] of \the town of] Arinna, the Lady of the Land, the servant of the goddess."

Hittite Treaties
(Translator: Albrecht Goetze)
Treaties, rare in other parts of the ancient Near East, are relatively frequent among the Hittite texts. Most of the surviving examples of this type have been translated previously. The most important publications are the following two: E. F. Weidner, Politische Do\umente aus Kleinasien (Boghaz\oi Studien, VIII and ix, 1923). J. Friedrich, Staatsvertrage des Hatti-Reiches in hethitischer Sprache (MVAG, x x x i / i , 1926 and xxxiv/i, 1930). From the legal point of view the treaties have been dealt with in the following book: V. Korosec, Hethitische Staatsvertrage.

Relations up to the Conclusion of the Treaty
Now I have established good brotherhood (and) good peace between us forever. In order to establish good peace (and) good brotherhood in [the relationship] of the land of Egypt with the Hatti land forever (I speak) thus: Behold, as for the relationship between the land of Egypt (10) and the Hatti land, since eternity the god does not permit the making of hostility between them because of a treaty (valid) forever. Behold, Rea-mashesha mai Amana, the great king, the king of the land of Egypt, in order to bring about the relationship that the Sun-god4 and the Storm-god5 have effected for the land of Egypt with the Hatti land finds himself in a relationship valid since eternity which [does not permi]t the making of hostility between [them] until all and everlasting time.
The Present Treaty
Rea-mashesha mai Amana, the great king, the king of the land of Egypt, has entered into a treaty (written) upon a silver tablet (15) with Hattusilis, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, [his] brother, [from] this [da]y on to establish good peace (and) good brotherhood be[tween us] forever. He is a brother [to me] and I am a brother to him and at peace with him forever. And as for us, our brotherhood and our peace is being brought about and it will be better than the brotherhood and the peace which existed formerly for the land of Egypt with the Hatti land.
1 This is Egyptian in cuneiform characters meaning "Ramses beloved of Amon." 2 This is the "throne name" of Seti I in cuneiform transliteration. 8 This is the "throne name" of Ramses I in cuneiform transliteration. 4 Rea (Re), the chief god of the Egyptians. 5 The chief god of the Hittites. His name cannot be put in the text because it is always written ideographically and his real name therefore unknown.
Future Relations of the Tu/o Countries
Behold, Rea-mashesha mai Amana, the king of the land of Egypt, is in good peace (and) in good brotherhood with [Hattusilis], the great king, the king of the Hatti land. Behold the sons of Rea-mashesha mai Amana, the king of the land of Egypt, (20) are in peace with (and) brothers of the sons of Hattusilis, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, forever. They are in the same relationship of brotherhood and peace as we. And as for (the relationship of) the land of Egypt with the Hatti land, they are at peace and brothers like us forever.
Mutual Renunciation of Aggression
Rea-mashesha mai Amana, the great king, the king of the land of Egypt, shall not tresspass into the Hatti land to take anything therefrom in the future. And Hattusilis, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, shall not tresspass into the land of Egypt to take anything therefrom in the future. Behold, the holy ordinance (valid) forever which the Sun-god and the Storm-god had brought about (25) for the land of Egypt with the Hatti land (calls for) peace and brotherhood so as not to make hostility between them. Behold, Rea-mashesha mai Amana, the great king, the king of the land of Egypt, has seized hold of it in order to bring about well-being from this day on.

And if Hattusilis, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, is angry with servants belonging to him (and if) they have failed against him and sends to Rea-mashesha mai Amana, the great king, the king of the land of Egypt, on their account—lo!

Succession to the Throne

Preamble
1. These are the words of the Sun1 Mursilis, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, the valiant, the favorite of the Storm-god, the son of Suppiluliumas, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, the valiant.
Historical Introduction
2. Aziras* was the grandfather of you, Duppi-Tessub. He rebelled against my father, but submitted again to my father. When the kings of Nuhasse land8 and the kings of Kinza4 rebelled against my father, Aziras did not rebel. As he was bound by treaty, he remained bound by treaty. As my father fought against his enemies, in the same manner fought Aziras. Aziras remained loyal toward my father [as his overlord] and did not incite my father's anger. My father was loyal toward Aziras and his country; he did not undertake any unjust action against him or incite his or his country's anger in any way. 300 (shekels of) refined and first-class gold, the tribute which my father had imposed upon your father, he brought year for year; he never refused it.
3. When my father became god5 and I seated myself on the throne of my father, Aziras behaved toward me just as he had behaved toward my father. It happened that the Nuhasse kings and the king of Kinza rebelled a second time against me. But Aziras, your grandfather, and Du-Tessub,8 your father, [did not take their side]; they remained loyal to me as their lord. [When he grew too old] and could no longer go to war and fight, Du-Tessub fought against the enemy with the foot soldiers and the charioteers of the Amurru land just as he had fought with foot soldiers and charioteers against the enemy. And the Sun destroyed them. (gap in which the reign of Du-Tessub was dealt with) 6*. (Du-Tessub recommends his son as his successor:) " [ . . . When I die, accept my son] Duppi-Tessub as your vassal." 7*. When your father died, in accordance with your

father's word I did not drop you. Since your father had mentioned to me your name with great praise, I sought after you. To be sure, you were sick and ailing, but although you were ailing, I, the Sun, put you in the place of your father and took your brothers (and) sisters and the Amurru land in oath for you.
Future Relations of the Two Countries
8*. When I, the Sun, sought after you in accordance with your father's word and put you in your father's place, I took you in oath for the king of the Hatti land, the Hatti land, and for my sons and grandsons. So honor the oath (of loyalty) to the king and the king's kin! And I, the king, will be loyal toward you, DuppiTessub. When you take a wife, and when you beget an heir, he shall be king in the Amurru land likewise. And just as I shall be loyal toward you, even so shall I be loyal toward your son. But you, Duppi-Tessub, remain loyal toward the king of the Hatti land, the Hatti land, my sons (and) my grandsons forever! The tribute which was imposed upon your grandfather and your fatherthey presented 300 shekels of good, refined first-class gold weighed with standard weights—you shall present them likewise. Do not turn your eyes to anyone else! Your fathers presented tribute to Egypt; you [shall not do that!]

Military Clauses
9**.7 [With my friend you shall be friend, and with my enemy you shall be enemy. If the king of the Hatti land is either in the Hurri land,8 or in the land of Egypt, or in the country of Astata," or in the country of Alse10—any country contiguous to the territory of your country that is friendly with the king of the Hatti land(or in) any country contiguous to the territory of your country that is friendly with the king of the Hatti land(as) the country of Mukis,11 the country of Halba12 (and) the country of Kinza13—but turns around and becomes inimical toward the king of the Hatti land while the king of the Hatti land is on a marauding campaign—if then you, Duppi-Tessub, do not remain loyal together with your foot soldiers and your charioteers and if you do not fight wholeheartedly; or if I should send out a prince (or) a high officer with foot soldiers and charioteers to re-enforce you, Duppi-Tessub, (for the purpose of) going out to maraud in an]other c[ountry—if then you, Duppi-Tessub, do not fight wholehea]rtedly (that) enemy with [your army and your charioteers] and speak as follows: "I am under an

oath of loyalty, but [how am I to know] whether they will beat the enemy, or the enemy will beat them?"; or if you even send a man to that enemy and inform him as follows: "An army and charioteers of the Hatti land are on their way; be on your guard!"—(if you do such things) you act in disregard of your oath. 10**. As I, the Sun, am loyal toward you, do you extend military help to the Sun and the Hatti land. If an evil rumor originates in the Hatti land that someone is to rise in revolt against the Sun and you hear it, leave with your foot soldiers and your charioteers and go immediately to the aid of the king of the Hatti land! But if you are not able to leave yourself, dispatch either your son or your brother together with your foot soldiers (and) your charioteers to the aid of the king of the Hatti land! If you do not dispatch your son (or) your brother with your foot soldiers (and) your charioteers to the aid of the king of the Hatti land, you act in disregard of the gods of the oath.
11**. If anyone should press you hard, Duppi-Tessub, or (if) anyone should revolt against you, (if) you then write to the king of the Hatti land, and the king of the Hatti land dispatches foot soldiers and charioteers to your aid—(if you treat them in an unfair manner14), you act in disregard of the gods of the oath. 12**. If they take Hittites—foot soldiers and charioteers—through Duppi-Tessub's territory and DuppiTessub provides them while passing through (his) towns with food and drink—(if that army) engages in any misconduct—pilfering in his country or his towns or in an attempt at deposing Duppi-Tessub from his kingship—it acts in disregard of the oath.
Dealings with Foreigners etc.
13**. If anyone of the deportees from the Nuhasse land or of the deportees from the country of Kinza whom my father removed and myself removed escapes and comes to you, (if) you do not seize him and turn him back to the king of the Hatti land, and even tell him as follows: "Go! Where you are going to, I do not want to know," you act in disregard of your oath. 14**. If anyone utters words unfriendly toward the king or the Hatti land before you, Duppi-Tessub, you shall not withhold his name from the king. Or if the Sun (iii) gives you an order in secrecy (saying): "Do this or that!" (if) that order cannot be executed, petition about it on the spot (stating): "This order I cannot execute and will not execute" and the king will reconsider it then and there. But if you do not execute an order which can (well) be executed and deceive the king, or (if) you do not keep to yourself the word which the king told you in secrecy, you act in disregard of the oath.
15**. If a country or a fugitive takes to the road and while betaking themselves to the Hatti land pass through your territory, put them on the right way, show them the way to the Hatti land and speak friendly words

to them! Do not send them to anyone else! If you do not put them on the right way, (if) you do not guide them on the right way to the Hatti land, but direct them into the mountains or speak unfriendly words before them, you act in disregard of the oath. 16**. Or if the king of the Hatti land is getting the better of a country and puts them to flight, and they come to your country, if then you desire to take anything from them, ask the king of the Hatti land for it! You shall not take it on your own! If you lay hand on it by yourself or conceal it, (you act in disregard of the oath). 17**. Furthermore, if a fugitive comes to your country, seize h i m ! . . .

(Less than half of the tablet—parts of the columns ii and iii—yields an intelligible text.) (ii) [If] anyone does something [in an uncl]ean way (or if) anyone arouses [the king's displeasure], (but) you say as follows: "[The king] is not seeing us," (be aware of the fact that) the king's gods will certainly observe you. They will treat you as a goat and pursue you over the mountains, they will treat you as a sheep and pursue you over the rocks. When some day the king's anger is aroused and I (the king) summon you, all the kitchen personnel, and hand you over to the River (for an ordeal)—whoever will be proven innocent, will remain the king's servant. But whoever will be proven guilty, I, the king, would not wish (to retain) him. Together with his wife and his children they shall put him to death. Further: You, all the kitchen personnel—the cupbearer, the table-man, the cook, the baker, the tawed man, the walhi man, the cellarius, the palandaldi, the dairy man, the kipliyalal, the surralai, the tappalal, the keeper of the loaves, the zuppalas—you will have to swear an oath of loyalty to the king every month. Fill a bitumen cup with water and pour it out toward the Sun-god and speak as follows: "Whoever does something in an unclean way and offers to the king polluted water, (iii) pour you, O gods, that man's soul out like water!"
Further: You who are the shoemakers who make the king's shoes, take always oxhides from the (royal) kitchen! Do not take any other! He who takes any other and it becomes known afterward, they will put him to death together with his offspring. Further: You who are leatherworkers of the house of the tarsipaliyal, of the house of the appal or the foreman of ten among the tarsipalaX and you who produce the chariot on which the king is to stand, take always oxhides (and) goatskins from the (royal) kitchen! Do not take any other! If you take any other and tell the king about it, it is no crime for you. I, the king, will send that abroad or give it to my servants. But if you conceal it and it becomes known afterward, they will put you to death together with your wives (and) your children. Further: You who are water carriers, be very careful with water! Strain the water with a strainer! At some
time I, the king, found a hair in the water pitcher in Sanahuitta. The king became angry and I expressed my anger to the water carriers (saying): "This is scandalous." Then Arnilis (said): "Zuliyas was careless." The king said: "Let Zuliyas go to the . . ,!x If he proves innocent, let him clean himself! If he is found guilty, he shall be killed!" Zuliyas went to the . .. and was found guilty. They placed Zuliyas [ . . . ] in Sures[ . . . ], the king [ .. . ] him and he died.

(15) Let them be bathed (and) groomed, let their (body) hair and nails be removed. Let them be clothed in clean dresses. [While unclean], let them not prepare (the loaves); let those who are [agreeable] to the gods' soul and person prepare them. The bakers' house in which they prepare them—let that be swept (and) scrubbed. (20) Furthermore, let a pig or a dog not stay at the door of the place where the loaves are broken. Are the minds of men and of the gods generally different? No! With regard to the matter with which we are dealing? No! Their minds are exactly alike. When a servant is to stand before his master, he is bathed and clothed in clean (garments); he either gives him his food, or he gives him his beverage. (25) And because he, his master, eats (and) drinks, he is relaxed in spirit and feels one with him. But if he (the servant) is ever remiss, (if) he is inattentive, his mind is alien to him. And if a slave causes his master's anger, they will either kill him or they will injure him at his nose, his eyes (or) (30) his ears; or [they will seize] him, his wife, his children, his brother, his sister, his in-laws, his kin whether it be a male slave or a slave-girl. They may (either) impose the extreme penalty, (or) they

may do to him nothing at all. If ever he is to die, he will not die alone; his kin will accompany him. 3. If then, on the other hand, anyone arouses the anger of a god, (35) does the god take revenge on him alone ? Does he not take revenge on his wife, his children, his descendants, his kin, his slaves, and slave-girls, his cattle (and) sheep together with his crop and will utterly destroy him ?

Further: The festival of the month, the festival of the year, the festival of the stag, the festival of autumn, (40), the festival of spring, the festival of thunder, the festival of hiyaral, the festival of pudahal, the festival of iluwaf, the festival of [ . . . ]dulaIJaJ, the festival of the rhyton, the festivals of the holy priest, the festivals of the Old Men, the festivals of the mothers-of-god, the festival of dahiyai, the festivals of the upati men, the festivals of puled, the festivals of hahratar, (45) or whatever festival else (will be celebrated) in Hattusa—if you do not celebrate them with all the cattle, sheep, loaves, beer (and) wine set (before the gods), and if you, the god's priests, make a deal with those who give all that, you can be sure that the gods will notice what is amiss.
5. (50) Or if you ever take (sacrifices that have been) set (before the gods) and do not carry them right to the gods themselves, (if) you withhold (it) from them, keep (it) in your houses, and your wives, children (or) servants consume it, (if) you give it to a relative or some ubaru befriended with you who happens to visit (you), if you give it to him (55) and take it away from the god and do not carry it right to him, (or if) you give it (to him) in several portions—you will be held responsible for that matter of dividing. Do not divide it. He who divides it, shall be killed; there shall be no recourse for him.
6. (60) Every bit of the loaves, the beer (and) the wine keep in the temple. Let no one appropriate for himself a sacrificial loaf of the god (or) a thin loaf. Let no one pour out beer (or) wine from the cup. Devote every bit to the god. Furthermore, in the presence of the god speak for yourselves (these) words: "Whoever has taken from thy divine loaves (65) (or) from the libation bowl, may the god, my lord, [punish] him; may he hold this man's house responsible for it!" (ii) If you [wish] to eat and to drink [ . . . ] on that day, eat and drink. If you cannot finish it, keep on eating (and) drinking [for] three days. But your wives, your children (and) your servants (5) must in no circumstances [ . . . cross] the threshold of the gods. But an ubaru who may come to see someone is allowed to enter the house of the god and he may also cross the threshold of the king.1 So let that man (whom he is visiting) conduct him up (to the temple) and let him eat (and) drink. But if it is (10) [a foreigner], if it is not a Hittite man, and he ap[proach]es the gods, [he shall be killed]. And he who conducts him (into
1 T h e beginning of the second column is preserved only on KUB, x m , 5.
the temple), it makes him liable of the death penalty too. 7. If an ox (or) a sheep is driven up to the god as food, and you appropriate for yourselves either a fattened ox or a fattened sheep and substitute a lean one which you have slaughtered, (15) and (if) you either consume that or put it into your pen, or put it under the yoke, or (if) you put the sheep into your fold (20) or kill it for yourselves, and (if) you see fit [to give it away] or to turn it over to another man, or (if) you accept a price for it and thus [take it away from] the god and withhold it from (his) mouth, (if) you take it for yourselves or give it to another man (25) and speak as follows: "Since he is a god, he will not say anything, and will not do anything to us"—just think how the man reacts who sees his (choice) morsel snatched away from before his eyes! The will of the gods is strong. It does not make haste to seize, (30) but when it seizes, it does not let go (again). Now be very reverent of the will of the gods. 8. Further: Whatever silver, gold, garments or bronze implements of the gods you hold, you are (merely) (their) caretakers. You have no right to the silver, gold, garments (and) bronze implements of the gods, and none whatsoever to the things that are in the gods' houses. (35) They belong to the god alone. Be very careful and let no temple official have silver (or) gold. Let him not carry it on his own body, and let him not make it into an ornament for his wife (or) his children. But if they give him (40) silver, gold, garments (and) bronze implements as a gift from the palace, let them be specified: "So-and-so, the king has given it to him." How much its weight is, let also be set down. Furthermore let it be set down thus: "At such-and-such a festival have they given it to him." Let also the witnesses be set down at the end: "When they gave it to him, so-and-so (45) and so-and-so were present." Furthermore let him not leave it in his house; let him offer it for sale. But when he sells it, let him not sell it in a secret place; let the Hittite lords be present and look on. Let that which (anyone) buys be listed on a tablet and let them seal it. (50) And when the king comes up to Hattusa, let him take it (the tablet) up to the palace and let them seal it. If he puts them up for sale on his own, he is liable to the death penalty. He who does not put up for sale silver, gold, garments (or) implements of bronze in the same way (as here described),* (55) also he who receives it and hides it and does not bring it to the king's court, both of them are liable to the death penalty, they shall both be killed. They are [disagreeable] to the gods. There shall in no circumstances be recourse for them. 9. Further: You who are temple officials, if you do not celebrate the festivals (60) at the time proper for the festivals and (if) you celebrate the festival of spring in the autumn, or (if)*—when in the course of time a festival is about to be celebrated—he who is to perform it comes to you, the priests, the "anointed," the mothers

of-god, and to the temple officials (65) and embraces your knees (saying): "The harvest is before me, or arranging for (my) marriage, or a journey, or some other business. Do me a favor and let me finish that business first. But when that business of mine is finished, (70) I shall perform the festival as prescribed"—do not yield to a man's whim, let him not ta\e precedence (of the gods). You must not make a deal of the gods' pleasure. Should with you a man ta\e precedence (of the gods) and should you make a deal for yourselves, the gods will seek to take revenge on you in the future. (75) They will hold a grudge against you, yourselves, your wives, your children (and) your servants. So act only according to the pleasure of the gods! And you will eat bread, drink water and establish a family. But do not act according to the pleasure of a man. Do not sell the death penalty, but do not buy the death penalty either. 10. (80) Further: You who are temple officials, be very careful with respect to the precinct. At nightfall promptly go to be in (the temple); eat (and) drink, and if the desire for a woman [overcom]es anyone, let him sleep with a woman, (iii) But as long as [ . . . ] let him stay and let e[very one] prompdy come up to spend the night in the temple. Whoever is a temple official, all high priests, minor priests, "anointed" or whoever else (5) is allowed to cross the threshold of the gods, let (them) not fail to spend the night in the temple one by one. Furthermore, there shall be watchmen employed by night who shall patrol all night through. Outside the enclosure guards shall watch, inside the temples shall the temple officials patrol all night through and they shall not sleep. Night by night one of the high priests shall be in charge of the patrols. Furthermore, someone of those who are priests shall be in charge of the gate of the temple and guard the temple. (15) In his own house no one (of these) shall spend the night with his wife. Whomsoever they will find down in his house, it will be a capital offense for him. Guard the temple very carefully and do not sleep. (Responsibility for) the precinct shall be divided among yourselves. He who commits an offense with respect to the precinct (20) shall be killed; he shall not be pardoned.
11. If anyone has some (official) duty to perform in Hattusa, and (either) a priest (or) an "anointed" is to admit people who are accompanied by guards, he will admit those too. If a guard is assigned to anyone, he may also enter the enclosure. (25) He must not speak thus: "I am guarding the house of my god, but I shall not go in there."—If there is some talk of enmity, (namely) that someone will undertake to defile Hattusa and (the guards) at the outer wall do not recognize him, but the temple officials recognize him inside, the guard shall definitely go after him. (30) (In) such (situation the) guard must not fail to spend the night with his god. If he fails however, in case they do not kill him, they shall humiliate him. Naked—there shall be no garment on his body—he shall bring three times
T R U C T I O N S 209
water from the Labarnas' cistern to the house of his god. Such shall be his humiliation. 12. (35) Further: O priests, "anointed," mothersof-god (and) temple officials! Some troublemaker may rise in the temple or another sacred building. If he rises in the temple and causes a quarrel and thereby interferes with a festival, they shall interfere with him. Let him celebrate that festival with the usual expenditure of sheep, bread (and) beer, (40) he must not even omit the thin loaf. Whoever fails (to provide) it and does not celebrate a fully set festival, it shall be a great offense for him and he shall make up for the festival. So be very careful with a quarrel.
13. Further: Be very careful with the matter of fire. (45) If there is a festival in the temple, guard the fire carefully. When night falls, quench well with water whatever fire remains on the hearth. But if there is any flame in isolated spots and (also) dry wood, (if) he who is to quench it (50) becomes criminally negligent in the temple—even if only the temple is destroyed, but Hattusa and the king's property is not destroyed—he who commits the crime will perish together with his descendants. Of those who are in the temple not one is to be spared; together with their descendants they shall perish. So for your own good be very careful in the matter of fire. 14. (55) Further: You who are kitchen servants of all the gods, cupbearers, table-men, cooks, bakers (or) vintners, be very careful with respect to the gods' mood. Spend much reverent care upon the gods' sacrificial loaves (and) libation bowls. The place where the bread is broken (60) shall be swept (and) scrubbed; (the regulations concerning) the threshold shall be enforced for pigs and dogs. As to yourselves, you shall be bathed and dressed in clean garments. Furthermore, your {body) hair and your nails shall be removed. Let the mood of the gods not befall you. (65) If a pig (or) a dog somehow approaches the implements of wood or bitumen which you have, and the kitchen servant does not discard it, but gives the god to eat from an unclean (vessel), to such a man the gods will give dung (and) urine to eat (and) to drink. Whoever is going to sleep with a woman, (70) he shall go to that woman in the same condition in which he performs a rite for the gods and gives the god his portion to eat and to drink.
Furthermore, [at ], as soon as the sun is up, he shall at once take a bath; and in the morning, at the time when the gods eat, he shall promptly be present. But, if he omits (to do so), it will be a sin for him. Whoever sleeps with a woman, (75) if his superior (or) his chief constrains (him), he shall say so. If he himself does not dare tell him, he shall tell his fellow servant and shall bathe anyway. But if he knowingly postpones it and without having bathed approaches the gods' sacrificial loaves (80) (and) libation bowl in an unclean condition, or (if) his fellow servant knows about him—namely that he placed himself first—but nevertheless conceals it, (if) afterward it becomes known, they are liable to the capital penalty; both of them shall be killed.

15. (iv) [Further: You who are the plowmen of the gods, . . . ]. The young animals which you, the plowmen, are supposed to have ready, have them promptly ready at the correct time. (5) Before a man has eaten from them, carry them promptly to the presence of the gods; let the gods not wait for them. If you delay them, you commit a sin. They will consult the oracles about you, and just as the gods, your lords, direct, so they will do to you. (10) They will fine you an ox and ten sheep and will pacify the mind of the gods. 16. Further: If you plant grain, and if the priest does not send you a man to plant the seed, you shall manage by yourselves. Should you plant much, (15) but tell the priest (that) it (was) little, or should the gods' field be thriving, but the field of the plowmen be barren and you call the gods' field yours, but your field that of the god, or should you when you store the grain declare one half, but conceal the other half (20) and should you proceed to divide it afterward among yourselves and should it(!) afterward become known—you may get away with appropriating it from a man, but you cannot appropriate it from a god—, you will commit a sin. They will take all the grain away from you and put it in the magazines of the gods. 17. (25) Further: You who hold the plow-oxen of [the gods], if you sell a plow-ox, or kill it and consume it, (if) you appropriate it for yourselves (while it belongs) to the god (saying): "It died from emaciation, or it broke (its legs), or it ran away, or the bull gored it" (3°) aRd consume it yourselves, and it afterwards becomes known, you will replace that ox. If however it does not become known, you will go before the god.2 If you are acquitted, (it is due to) your patron god; if you are convicted, it is considered a capital sin for you. 18. Further: You who are the gods' cowherds (and) the gods' shepherds, (35) if there is a rite for any god at the time of bearing young and you are supposed to have ready for him either a calf, a lamb, a kid or choice animals, do not delay them! Have them ready at the right time; do not let the gods wait for them. Before a man eats of the young animals, (40) bring it promptly to the gods. Or if there is a "festival of the cup" for any god, (even) while they repair the cup, do not allow it to lapse; celebrate it for him. If you do not bring the young animals promptly to the gods, but eat first of them yourselves (45) or send them to your superiors, but it afterward becomes known, it is considered a capital sin for you. If it does not become known—at whatever time you will bring them, you will bring them before the god with these words: "If we have given this young animal to ourselves first, (50) or have given it to our superiors, or to our wives, our children or to anyone else, we have offended the gods' feelings." Then you will drink dry the rhyton of the god of life.3 If you are found innocent, (it is due to) your patron god; but
2 i.e. you will be subject to an ordeal. 8 A kind of ordeal.
if you are found guilty, you will perish together with
(55) y°ur wives (and) your children.
19. Further: If you ever make a selection (of animals) and they drive them up to the gods, your lords, the cowherd and the shepherd shall go with that selection. In the same condition in which they are selected from the pen (and) the fold, (60) shall they bring them to the gods. On the road they must not exchange them. But if any cowherd or shepherd does wrong on the road, exchanges either a fattened ox or a fattened sheep, or makes a deal or kills it and (65) they eat it up, and put in its place an emaciated (animal), and it becomes known, it is considered a capital sin for them; they have taken the gods' choice morsel. But if it does not become known, whenever they arrive they shall take the rhyton of the god of life from the cult stand, (70) and while doing so they shall declare as follows: "If we have for ourselves withheld from the mouth of the gods their (choice) morsel, and have given it to ourselves, or (if) we have sold it for ourselves, or if we have exchanged it, made a deal (75) and substituted in its place an emaciated (animal), then do thou, O god, pursue us together with our wives (and) our children on account of thy own (choice) morsel!"
From the Instructions for the Commander of the Border Guards
Text: KUB, xhi, 2 ii 26-iii 35 and its duplicates KUB, xxxi, 90 ii 7 ff. and KUB, xxxi, 86 iv 1 ff. ( + ) 88 iii 1 ff. Literature: V. KoroSec, Zborni\ znanstvenih razprav juridtine faJydtete, vm (1942), 139-170 (with a summary in Italian).
In the town through which the commander of the border guards passes on his tour of inspection he shall attend to the necessary provisions for town-elders, priests, "anointed" (and) mothers-of-god. He shall speak to them as follows: "The sanctuary which exists in this town, whether it is of the Storm-god or of other gods, (30) is now collapsed and in disrepair. It is not provided with priests, mothers-of-god (and) 'anointed.' So provide it again with such (functionaries)! They shall restore it. As it was built previously, (35) so shall they rebuild it."
Furthermore, due reverence shall be shown to the gods, but to the Storm-god special reverence shall be shown. If some temple has a leading roof, the commander of the border guards and the town commandant shall put it right, or (if) any rhyton of the Storm-god (40) or any implement of any other god is in disrepair, the priests, the "anointed" (and) the mothers-of-god shall restore it. Furthermore, the commander of the border guards shall make an inventory of the god's utensils and send it before the Sun.1 Furthermore, they shall worship the
1 i.e. the Hittite king.



2 o 8h i t t i t ei n s t r u c t i o n s
gods on the right dates. If a certain date is set for some god, they shall worship him on that date. (45) If some god has no priest, mother-of-god (or) "anointed," they shall promptly appoint one. (iii) [If] no provisions have been made [for sacrifices to the gods'] stone pillars, provide for them now! They shall arrange for them, and furthermore they shall present whatever sacrifices have long been customary. The rites which are established for the springs that are in the town, (5) they shall go to them and celebrate their rites. And those springs for which rites have not been established, they shall go to them all the same. In no circumstances shall they omit them. They shall regularly give sacrifices to the mountains (and) to the rivers for which such are established. Furthermore, the commander of the border guards, the town commandant and the elders shall judge and decide legal cases (10) in accordance with the law. As it has been from olden days—in a town in which they have been accustomed to imposing the death penalty, they shall continue to do so. But in a town where they have been accustomed to imposing exile, they shall continue that (custom). (15) Furthermore, the citizens shall bathe afterward and there shall be a public announcement. No one shall let (the exiled) return. He who lets him return, shall be put in prison.
And when they worship the gods, let no one start a disturbance in the presence of the gods, let no one start a disturbance in the house of festival. Furthermore let reverence be paid to the priests, the lay brothers, the "anointed" (20) (and) the mothers-of-god. Reverence toward the gods shall be the duty of the priests, the "anointed" and the mothers-of-god. If anyone brings suit by means of a sealed brief, the commander of the border guards shall judge it according to the law and set it right. If the case is too much, he shall send it before the Sun.1
(25) He must not decide it in favor of his superior, he must not decide it in favor of his brother, his wife or his friend; no one shall be shown any favor. He must not make a just case unjust; he must not make an unjust case just. Whatever is right, that shall he do. Whenever you arrive at a town, call all the people of the town (30) together. For him who has a complaint, judge it and set him right If a man's slave or a man's slave-girl or a widowed woman has a complaint (against some one) judge it for them and set them right. Should Kassiya people, Himmuwa people, Tagaramma people and Isuwa people2 be there, (35) attend to them in every way.

A ROYAL DECREE OF TEMPLE PRIVILEGE
No codes of laws have been found for ancient Egypt. This means either that such collections of laws were written on papyrus and leather and so have not survived or that pharaonic Egypt did not codify law, but rather operated on the basis of topical justice originating in the word of the god-king. We do possess royal decrees, framed to meet particular situations.1 Most common are the charters of immunity, granting a temple exemption from civil obligation. The following decree of the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Nefer-iri-ka-Re (26th century b.c.) freed the personnel of the Temple of Osiris at Abydos from forced labor for the state. The stela was found at Abydos and is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (03.1896). The text was published by W . M. F. Petrie, Abydos II (London, 1903), Pis. xiv, x v i i i , and by K. Sethe, Ur\unden des cdten Reichs (Ur^·, 1, Leipzig, 1933), 170-72. It was studied by Sethe in GGA (1912), 733 ff., and by A. Moret in J A (1917), 429 ff. Other royal decrees or references thereto will be found at pp. 31-32; 252, n.9; 327; 329. *(See Addenda).

THE VIZIER OF EGYPT
By dogma the pharaoh of Egypt was the state, but in actual practice he had to delegate authority to others. The most important civil official was the vizier, who was directly responsible to the pharaoh and to whom most of the other officials were responsible. We possess a fair amount of material with regard to the vizier under the Egyptian Empire. The following texts relate to Rekh-mi-Re, the Vizier of Upper Egypt under the reign of Thut-mose III (about 1490-1436 b . c . ) . The texts are from the tomb of Rekh-mi-Re, No. 100 at Thebes. They have been published by N. de G. Davies, The Tomb of Re\h-mi-Re at Thebes (Publications of the Metro
politan Museum of Art, xi, New York, 1943), two volumes, including translations. The texts were earlier presented in K.
5 The original decree was on a scroll, and pharaoh gave his sanctioning presence to the sealing of this document Around 2530 B.C., the date would fall in February or March.

Sethe, Ur\unden der 18. Dynastie (i/rifc., iv, Leipzig, 1909), 10711117, and translated by'Breasted, AR, 11, §§663-711.
A. FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF REKH-MI-RE
In a lengthy statement about his worldly position and success, the vizier tells about his appointment to that office. Davies, opxit., 79-83, Pis. x i - x i i .
I was a noble, the second of the king and the fourth of him who judged the Pair.1... It was the first occasion of my being summoned. All my brothers were in the outer office. I went (5) forth . . . clad in fine linen. . .. I reached the doorway of the palace gate. The courtiers bent their backs, and I found the masters of ceremonies clearing the way [before m e ] . . . . My abilities were not as they had been: my yesterday's nature had altered itself, since I had come forth in the accoutrements [of the vizier, having been promoted] to be Prophet of Maat.2 . . . I was [summoned] again into the presence of the good god (Thut-mose III) His majesty opened his mouth and spoke his words veritably (10) in my presence: "Now behold, I see a face which I send to my heart,8 [for my majesty knows] that decisions are many, without limit to them, and the judging of cases never falls off. Would that thou mightest act in conformance with what I may say! Then Maat will rest in her place." He charged me very much: "Gather thyself together; be strong in action; do not flag...
[/ acted] in conformance with that which he had ordained. He gave me a tribunal under my authority, and there was none therein who could oppose me. . . . I raised justice4 to the height of heaven; I made its beauty circulate to the width of earth, so that it rested in their nostrils (20) like the north wind, when it has driven bitterness away from the body.5 . . . When I judged (37) the petitioner, I was not partial. I did not turn my brow for the sake of reward. I was not angry [at him who came] as [a petitioner], nor did I rebuff him, (but) I tolerated him in his moment of outburst. I rescued the timid from the violent....
B. THE INSTALLATION OF THE VIZIER
Another long text gives the charge which Thut-mose III laid upon his newly appointed vizier. Davies, opxit., 84-88, Pis. xivxv, with Pis. c x v i - c x v i i i adding the same text from the tombs of two other viziers of the Eighteenth Dynasty.
The regulations laid upon the Vizier Re[kh-mi-Re], when the tribunal was ushered into audience hall of Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health!—and it was caused
1 He was the immediate assistant of the king, just as if he were a partner of the god Thoth in judging Horus and Seth—thus making a fourth to these three gods. 2 The goddess Maat was "Truth" or "Justice." In his capacity as the highest magistrate, Rekh-mi-Re was the priest of Maat 'Translation uncertain, assumed to mean: I see someone with whom I have sympathy because of his arduous duties. Davies: "My eyes send me to my heart"—grammatically impeccable, but unintelligible. 4 The same word maat as that of n.2 above, but not here determined with the picture of a goddess. 5 The north wind was Egypt's refreshing wind.

that the newly appointed Vizier [Rekh-mi-Re] be brought in. (1) Then his majesty said to him: "Look thou to this office of vizier. Be vigilant over [everything that] is done in it. Behold, it is the support of the entire land. Behold, as to the vizierate, behold, it is not sweet at all, behold, it is as bitter as gall.... Behold, it does not mean giving attention (only) to himself and to his officials and councillors, nor (yet) making [dependents] out of everybody (5) Therefore, see to it for thyself that all [things] are done according to that which conforms to law and that all things are done in conformance to the precedent® thereof in [setting every man iri\ his just deserts. Behold, as for the official who is in public view, the (very) winds and waters report all that he does; so, behold, his deeds cannot be unknown. . . . Behold, it is the official's place of refuge to act in conformance with the regulations. . . . [The] (12) abomination of the god is partiality. This is the instruction, and thus shalt thou act: 'Thou shalt look upon him whom thou knowest like him whom thou k no west not, upon him who has access to thee like him who is far away.' . . .(17). · · Behold, thou shouldst attach to thy carrying out of this office thy carrying out of justice. Behold, what is desired is that the carrying out of justice be the produce of the vizier.7..."
C. THE JUDICIAL SITTING OF THE VIZIER
In a long and detailed text, Rekh-mi-Re tells of the several functions of his office. This translation deals only with the rules for the judicial hearings of the vizier in his hall of justice.

As for everything which this official, the Vizier, shall do while holding hearings in the Hall of the Vizierhe shall sit upon a judgment-chair, with a matting on the floor, a matting over him, a cushion under his back and a cushion under his feet, a [cape] upon him, a sceptre at his hand, and the forty leather straps8 spread out in front of him, the Chiefs of Southern Tens9 on two sides in front of him, the Overseer of the Cabinet on his right hand, the Supervisor of Clients on his left hand,

The scene of hearing shows forty oblong or tubular things lying on mats in front of the vizier. The present word has a skin determinative. These have been assumed to be the scrolls of the law, written on leather, our only indication of codified law at this time. Unfortunately, Davies (pp. 31-32) shows evidence that they were used for maintaining authority or for punishment, citing a passage in which a man was "beaten with fifty shesem" He concludes that the forty which were spread out were symbols of authority. 9 A body of magistrates.

RESULTS OF A TRIAL FOR CONSPIRACY
The Twentieth Dynasty has provided us with a mass of legal material, particularly on the proceedings occasioned by the plundering of Theban tombs.1 We shall present here extracts from a document of different nature, dealing with a harem conspiracy and the plot to supplant Ramses III upon his throne by one of his sons.2 It is uncertain whether the conspiracy was successful to the point of taking the life of Ramses III. In that case, the court of inquiry and punishment will have been constituted by Ramses IV in the name of his dead father. Alternatively, Ramses III survived the plot and himself constituted the court.
The manuscript is the ludicial Papyrus of Turin, dated to the end of the reign of Ramses III (about 1164 b . c . ) . The hieratic text was facsimiled by T. Deveria in Bibliotheque egyptologique (ed. by G. Maspero), v (Paris, 1897), Pis. v-vi, 97-251. It was translated by Breasted, AR, rv, §§416-53. Its most recent study was by A . de Buck in JEA, x x i i i (1937), 152-64. T h e lost beginning of the manuscript probably gave the setting of the conspiracy.
T w o other texts have a juridical setting: the story of the Eloquent Peasant (pp. 407-410) and the story of the contendings of Horus and Seth (pp. 14-17), although the latter is a burlesque on court procedure. For advice on conduct in court, see the Instruction of Amen-em-Opet (p. 424). For a prayer that the poor man may be protected against avarice in court, see p. 380.

10 The scene of the judgment hall shows two balanced groups of twenty men each on the two sides of the hall. 11 The scene shows bailiffs bringing in the appellants, by the wrist or by the scruff of the neck. Our text is uncertain. The translation assumes that one whose position is far enough advanced has been neglected in the hearing; when he protests, he is hauled forward by a bailiff to an immediate hearing. Davies, on the contrary, assumes that the individual seeks unfair advantage and is then to be arrested: "Should one who is further forward say, 'No one near me is to be heard (before me),' he is to be arrested by the apparitors of the vizier." The text continues with a long statement of the several duties of the vizier, including several passages on his judicial function.
1 See T. E. Peet, The Great Tomb-Robberies of the Twentieth Egyptian Dynasty (Oxford, 1930), J. Capart et al. in JEA XXII (1936), 169-93. 2 One conspiracy within the royal palace is indicated in the Instruction of King Amen-em-het I (pp. 418-419 below). Another, of the 6th dynasty, is in the text of Breasted, AR, 1, §310:—"When a case was examined in secret in the royal harem against the King's Wife and Great of Wand, his majesty had me go down to hear it alone." There, as in our present text, the name of the accused is suppressed, and only her tide is given. 8 The court of inquiry consists of palace officials, apparently all persons in positions of intimate trust to the pharaoh. One among them, Baal-mahar, bears a Semitic name. This court divides into three groups. The two treasury overseers, the two standard-bearers, the Butler Pai-Bes, and the Scribe May are "the great officials of the Place of Examination," who try almost all of those under section I of the translation. A second group of four or five butlers, who try the last man of section I, are particularly concerned with the major criminals of section III. The Herald Pen-Renenut and the Scribe Pa-Re-em-heb are given in no other lists of judges, and may have been other officers of the court. Note that three of the "great officials" turn up as criminals in sections IV and V.

But [I] charged [them strictly], saying: "Be careful, guard against having punishment inflicted (upon) a [person] irregularly [by an official] who is not over him" So I said to them repeatedly, (iii 1) As for all that they have done, it is they who have done it. Let all that they have done come upon their (own) heads, whereas I am privileged and immune unto eternity, since I am among the righteous kings who are in the presence of AmonRe, King of the Gods, and in the presence of Osiris, Ruler of Eternity.5

(iv 1 ) PERSONS brought in because of the great crimes which they had committed, and turned over to the Place of Examination, in the presence of the great officials of the Place of Examination, in order to be examined by: the Overseer of the Treasury Montu-em-tawi; the Overseer of the Treasury Paif-ru; the Standard-Bearer Kar; the Butler Pai-Bes; the Scribe of the Archives May; and the Standard-Bearer Hori.6 They examined them. They found them guilty. They caused their sentences to overtake them. Their crimes seized them.7 The great enemy Pai-bak-kamen,8 who had been Chief of the Chamber.

He had begun to take their words outside to their mothers and their brothers who were there, saying: "Gather people and stir up enemies to make rebellion against their lord!" He was placed in the presence of the great officials of the Place of Examination. They examined his crimes.
* As de Buck suggests, the insistence of the pharaoh that he does not know who were the criminals against his throne and who was punished for conspiracy probably means that he accepts no personal responsibility for the fate of individuals. See the next note. 5 The pharaoh states explicitly that responsibility falls upon the heads of the judges and that he is "sheltered and protected" forever from any responsibility. In connection with the final clauses, one may argue that the pharaoh was already dead and was refusing to take into the presence of the gods any responsibility for taking the lives of others. 6 Although these are the "great officials" (cf. n.3 above), the criminals whom they try and sentence are not of such calibre that they are permitted to take their own lives, contrasting with those in sections II and III. 7 The sentences which were imposed are not stated. 8 "This Blind Slave." It has frequently been pointed out that some of these criminals have fictitious names. To be sure, the name Pa-tjau-emdiArnon, "The Breath (of Life) is With Amon," is a perfectly good Egyptian name. However, Mesed-su-Re, "Re Hates Him," Pen-Huy-bin, "He of the Wicked Huy," Bin-em-Waset, "The Wicked One in Thebes," and probably Pa-Re-kamenef, "The Re Will Blind (Him)," are all names of opprobrium, given either to degrade the criminals or to conceal their true and formerly honored names. See n.18 below.

The present group includes two clerks from those archives; a priest of Sekhmet, which means priest, physician, and magician; and a lector priest, versed in the magical writings. The present group was apparendy guilty of using magical texts for the conspiracy. 16 It has been pointed out that this tide gave rise to the word used (e.g. Gen. 41:8) for the Egyptian magicians; cf. de Buck, op. cit., 163. 17 Here, if Pen-ta-Urt was truly the pretender to the throne, the reason for permitting suicide is obvious. The prince was of too high a birth to incur a capital punishment. 18 Apparendy the prince who was the pretender of the conspiracy, being advanced by his mother, Tiye. Breasted assumes that the trial gives him an assumed name, to protect his own name. De Buck suggests that the conspirators had given him another name for his claim to kingship, that is, a full royal titulary. 19 The translation omits two other officials, recorded in the same terms as Henuten-Amon. 20 T w o of the following four had been judges in the court of examination, two were of the military or police, perhaps attached to that court. The instructions which they had "abandoned" were those of the pharaoh in constituting the court.

FROM THE RECORD OF A LAWSUIT
The following text has lost its beginning and its end, but it gives an adequate impression of legal proceedings under the Egyptian Empire. A merchant Raia offered the woman Iri-nofret a female slave from Palestine or Syria. Iri-nofret bought the slave for a price calculated in silver, but paid in goods, some of which she already had, but some of which she had to buy from other persons. Some time later, a soldier named Nekhy laid the legal charge that some of the payment for the slave had consisted of goods properly belonging to a woman named Bake-Mut. The court is examining this charge. The papyrus was discovered by the Metropolitan Museum of Art at Thebes and is now Cairo Museum 65739. It dates to the Nineteenth Dynasty (13th century B . C . ) . It was published by A . H . Gardiner in JEA, xxi (1935), 140-46, Pis. x i i i - x v i .
. . -1 SAID BY the woman2 Iri-nofret: "[As for me, I am the wife of the District Overseer Si-Mut], and I came to live in his house, and I worked and [wove] and took care of my (own) clothes. In the year 15, seven years after I had entered the house of the District Overseer Si-[Mut], the merchant Raia approached me with the Syrian slave Gemni-her-imentet,8 while she was (still) a girl, [and he] (5) said to me: 'Buy this girl and give me the price for her'—so he spoke to me. And I took the girl and gave him [the price] for her. Now look, I shall tell the price which I gave for her: 1 shroud of Upper Egyptian linen, making 5 \idet of silver;4
21 "They had made a beer-hall." For officers of the court of inquiry to carouse in a friendly way with the harem women whom they were trying was obviously a serious breach of judicial behavior.
22 "One fought with him with bad words strongly," i.e. he was let off with a reprimand. Apparendy Hori—also one of the original judges—had been friendly with the preceding group, but had not acted with them in the carousing.
1 The lost beginning probably included a date (presumably in the reign of Ramses II), the composition of the court, and the accusation of the soldier Nekhy. 2 Here and below, the tide "Living-Woman of the Town" is rendered simply "woman." ' T h e Kharu ("Horite") slave was given this Egyptian name after she was purchased by Iri-nofret. We are not told her Asiatic name. 4 Each element of the payment was calculated in a weight of silver. Ten kidet made one Egyptian deben, equal to about 91 grams or 3 oz. Troy.
i sheet of Upper Egyptian linen, making bidet of silver; 8 bought from the woman Kafy, 1 bronze jar, making 18 deben, making 1 2 / 3 J(idet of silver;".. . ( 1 0 ) . . . bought from the Chief Steward of the House of Amon, Tutu: 1 bronze jug, making 20 debeny making 2 kidet of silver; 10 shirts of fine Upper Egyptian linen, making 4 kidet of silverTOTAL of everything, 4 deben, 1 of silver.7 And I gave them to the merchant Raia, and there was nothing in them belonging to the woman Bake-Mut. And he gave me this girl, and I called her by the name Gemni-her-imentet." ( 1 5 ) SAID BY the tribunal of judges to the woman Irinofret: "Take the oath of the Lord—life, prosperity, health!—with the words: 'Should witnesses be brought up against me that any property belonged to the woman Bake-Mut within the silver which I gave for this servant and I concealed it, I shall be (liable) to one hundred blows, while I am deprived of her.'" OATH of the Lord—life, prosperity, health!—spoken by the woman Iri-nofret: "As Amon endures and as the Ruler—life, prosperity, health!—endures, should witnesses be brought up against me that any property belonged to the woman Bake-Mut within the silver which I gave for this servant and I concealed it, I shall be (liable) to one hundred blows, while I am deprived of her!" SAID BY the tribunal of judges to the soldier Nekhy: (20) "Produce for us the witnesses of whom you said that they knew that this silver belonging to the woman Bake-Mut was given to buy the slave Gemni-her-imentet, as well as the witnesses about this tomb of which you said that it was the woman Bake-Mut who made it, but the woman Iri-nofret gave it to the merchant Nakht, and he gave her the slave Tener-Ptah in exchange for it."8 QUANTITY OF witnesses whom the soldier Nekhy named in the presence of the tribunal: the Chief of Police Min-i.. . ; the Mayor of the West Ra-mose; the Priest Huy Phinehas, the elder brother of the District Overseer Si-Mut; the woman Kafy, (25) the wife of the Chief of Police Pa-shed, who is dead; the woman Weretnofret: and the woman Hut-ia, the elder sister of the
Thus the present piece of cloth (of Iri-nofret's own weaving?) was worth about 45 grams of silver. 5 The translation omits three other payments of Iri-nofret's own linen, totalling 14 \idet of silver. • T h e translation omits four other purchases by Iri-nofret, of bronze vessels, beaten copper, and honey. One of these purchases was from the Priest Huy Phinehas, mentioned below as a witness against her. From the conversions of bronze or copper into silver, the ratio of silver to copper in the 19th dynasty was 100:1, calculated to the nearest convenient fraction. 7 The price of the Syrian slave girl was 4.1 deben of silver, about 375 grams or 1 Troy pound. J. Cernf, in Archiv Orientdlm, vi (1933), 173 ff., showed that, at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th dynasty, 1 Xhar of emmer wheat was worth 1 deben of copper. Using the ratio of 100:1 of the preceding note, this would make 2.25 bushels of emmer worth 1 deben of copper, and the 410 deben of copper value given for the slave girl would work out at more than 900 bushels of emmer. But there are several uncertainties in the calculation; see Gardiner, op. at., 146. 8 It is not clear how this transaction of the tomb and the purchase of a male slave figures in the accusation. It is apparendy a second charge against Iri-nofret.

Now do I, Mahseiah, say to you, Build and equip that site . . . and dwell thereon with your wife. But you may not sell that house or give it as a present to others; only your children by my daughter Mibtahiah shall have power over it after you two. If tomorrow or some other day you build upon this land, and then my daughter divorces you and leaves you, she shall have no power to take it or give it to others; only your children by (10) Mibtahiah shall have power over it, in return for the work which you shall have done. If, on the other hand, she recovers from you,2 she [may] take half of the house, and [the] othe[r] half shall be at your disposal in return for the building which you will have done on that house. And again as to that half, your children by Mibtahiah shall have power over it after you. If tomorrow or another day I should institute suit or process against you and say I did not give you this land to build on and did not draw up this deed for you, I (15) shall give you a sum of 10 karshin by royal weight, at the rate of 2 R* to the ten, and no suit or process shall lie. This deed was written by 'Atharshuri b. Nabuzeribni in the fortress of Syene at the dictation of Mahseiah. Witnesses hereto (signatures).

Perhaps there is a lacuna in the text. 8 Probably stands for rub'in "quarters" (of a shekel). Does 2 / 4 X 1 0 ( = 1 / 5 ) indicate the proportion of alloy? * See n.i. • T h e name of Ashor's father (sh') is preserved in another document.

III. Historical Texts






Egyptian Historical Texts
TRANSLATOR: JOHN A.WILSON
Brief Texts of the Old Kingdom
Inscriptional evidence on the relations of Egypt and Asia under the Old Kingdom is slight. For the most part, we rely upon the uninscribed materials coming out of excavations in both areas for evidence on the strength of such contacts. The following are samples of texts playing on the problem of Egyptian interest in Asia* (See Addenda).
a
The jar-sealing of a Second Dynasty king, who lived about 2850 or 2800 B.C., may be read as the record of military activity in Asia. Such sealings have been found at Abydos: W. M. F. Petrie, The Royal Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties, 11 (London, 1901), PL xxii; E. Naville et al., The Cemeteries of Abydos, 1 (London, 1914), PL x.
The Seth: Per-ibsen, the tribute of Asia.1
b
Three notations from the "Annals" of the Old Kingdom on the reign of Snefru of the Fourth Dynasty (about 2650 or 2600 B.C.) show trade relations between Egypt and Phoenicia and the use to which the timber brought from Asia was put. These items are extracted from the records of three successive years. The Palermo Stone, recto vi 2-4, was published by H. Schäfer, Ein Bruchstück altägyptischer Annalen {APAW, 1902), and the present extracts by K. Sethe, Urkunden des alten Reichs (Ur\., 1, Leipzig, 1933), 236-37. Translated by Breasted, AR, i, §§146-48. On the interpretation of the text see K. Sethe, in ZAeS, XLV (1908), 7-14.
Bringing forty ships filled (with) cedar logs. Shipbuilding (of) cedarwood, one "Praise-of-the-TwoLands" ship, 100 cubits (long), and (of) meru-wood, two ships, 100 cubits (long). Making the doors of the royal palace (of) cedarwood.2
c
We have somewhat more information about the Egyptians' activity in Sinai, because of their interest in the turquoise and copper mines there. However, under the Old Kingdom the records in the mining area normally give little more than a depiction of the pharaoh smiting a nomad, with the pharaoh's name accompanying the scene. Such are the records of Semerkhet of the First Dynasty (about 2950 or 2900 B.C.), and of Djoser and Za-nakht of the Third Dynasty (about 2750 or 2700 B.C.), published in Gardiner and Peet, The Inscriptions of Sinai, 1 (2nd ed. by J. Cerny, London, 1952), Pis. 1, iv, §§1-4* The same publication (PL 11, Nos. 5, 7)3 shows also scenes of Snefru and Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty (2650 or 2600 B.C.)
1 Per-ibsen identified himself as a king with the god Seth, rather than the god Horus. The word Setjet, here translated " A s i a , " cannot as yet be made more precise. It applied to regions east and northeast of Egypt. 2 The word here translated "cedar" probably applied to that wood and other coniferous woods also. At any rate, it and tneru-v/ood were conifers, brought by sea from Phoenicia or "Cilicia. T h e ships were over 50 meters (over 170 feet) long. 3 These two texts also presented in Sethe's Urkunden des alten Reichs, 1, 7-8, and translated in Breasted, AR, 1, §§168-69,
clubbing kneeling figures and accompanied by the following legends:
Snefru, the great g o d , . . . Subjugating foreign countries. Khnum-Khufu, the great god. Smiting the nomads [of Asia].
Asiatic Campaigns Under Pepi I
For the most part, it is an argument from silence to assume that military contact between Egypt and Asia was slight under the Old Kingdom. Rare bits of evidence indicate that a certain amount of aggressive activity was normal on the part of Egypt. We need to interpret the significance of the "prisoners" in Egyptian ships returning from Asia in the time of Sahu-Re of the Fifth Dynasty (about 2550 B.C.).1 There is a tomb scene of the late Fifth or early Sixth Dynasty (2500-2350 B.C.) showing the Egyptians making a successful attack on a fortress peopled with Asiatics.2 Finally, there is the text which follows, which may apply to a particularly aggravated situation or which may represent a normal situation of fighting, not otherwise stated to us. A certain career official of the Sixth Dynasty, named Uni, left an inscription in his cenotaph at Abydos, giving us the chief stages of his career under various pharaohs. Under Pepi I (about 2375 or 2350 B.C.), Uni was particularly active as a military commander against the Asiatics. Cairo Museum 1435 has most recently been published by L. Borchardt, Denkmäler des Alten Reiches (Catalogue general ... du Musie du Caire, Berlin, 1937), 1, 115 if., Pis. 29-30, with antecedent bibliography. See also P. Tresson, L'inscription d'Ouni (Bibliotheque d'Etude, viii, Cairo, 1919), and K. Sethe, Urkunden des alten Reichs (Url(., 1, 2nd ed., Leipzig, 1932), 1, 98-110. Translated in Breasted, AR, 1, §§306-15.
For the presence of Asiatics in the Egyptian Delta between the Old and Middle Kingdoms, see the Instruction for King Meri-ka-Re (pp. 414-418 below), the Prophecy of Neferrohu (pp. 444-446 below), and the Admonitions of Ipu-wer (pp. 441-444 below).
For conditions at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, see the Instruction of King Amen-em-het (pp. 418-419 below) and the Story of Si-nuhe (pp. 18-22 above).
When his majesty imposed punishment upon the Asiatics Who-are-Upon-the-Sands,3 his majesty made an

Although the names Nedia and Ain-. . . are given in an accompanying broken text, it is not certain that either of these names applies to the fortress, and neither of the names can be located. 3 T h i s should mean desert nomads, and probably did mean that in the first instance. It came to be a term of scorn for all Asiatics. As will appear later in this inscription, these "Sand-Dwellers" were agriculturalists who built buildings.

army of many ten-thousands,4 in the entire Upper Egypt, the south being Elephantine and the north being Aphroditopolis, and in Lower Egypt: in both of the (administrative) sides of the realm, (15) in the (frontier) fortress, and in the midst of the (frontier) fortresses; among the Nubians of Irtjet, the Nubians of Madjoi, the Nubians of Yam, among the Nubians of Wawat, among the Nubians of Kaau, and from the land of the Temeh-Libyans.5 His majesty sent me at the head of this army, while the counts, while the SealBearers of the King of Lower Egypt, while the Sole Companions of the Palace, while the nomarchs and mayors of Upper and Lower Egypt, the companions and chief dragomans, the chief prophets of Upper and Lower Egypt, and the chief bureaucrats were (each) at the head of a troop of Upper or Lower Egypt, or of the villages and towns which they might rule, or of the Nubians of these foreign countries. I was the one who used to make the plan for them, although my office was (only that of) Chief Domain Supervisor of the Palace, because I was (so) fitted for the post that not one of them (so much as) laid a hand upon his fellow, (20) that not one of them appropriated (so much as) a lump of dough or a pair of sandals from a wayfarer, that not one of them carried off (so much as) a /o/Vzcloth from any town, that not one of them carried off any goat from anybody.
I Jed them to Northern Island, Doorway of Ii-hotep, and the District of Horus: Neb-maat,8 while I was in this office. . . . All these troops explored for me; never had there been (such) exploration for any other servant.7
This army returned in safety, After it had hacked up the land of the [Sand]Dwellers. This army returned in safety, After it had crushed the land of the SandDwellers. This army returned in safety, After it had thrown down its8 enclosures. This army returned in safety, After it had cut down its8 fig trees and its vines. (25) This army returned in safety, After it had cast fire into all its8 dwellings. This army returned in safety, After it had killed troops in it by many tenthousands. This army returned in safety, [After it had taken troops] in it, a great multitude as living captives.9
4 The figure is flamboyant, not to be taken literally. 6 There were levies on all parts of Egypt, and soldiers were recruited or drafted from the lands to the south and west of Egypt. 6 These three places cannot be located. One may argue that "Northern Island" might apply to one of the watered parts of the Delta, that a "Doorw a y " might be a frontier post, and that the pharaoh Snefru ("Horus: Nebmaat") was a patron of the Sinai area. This would provide three successive stages of exit from Egypt, but it would be based on three guesses. 7 Or, "I opened the number of these troops; never had there been opened for any servant," in the sense of finding the number of soldiers? 8 The land's. " T h i s hymn of a victoriously returning army shows that the "SandDwellers" had orchards and vineyards, fortified enclosures, and troops in
His majesty praised me for it more than anything. His majesty sent me to lead [this] army five times, in order to repel the land of the Sand-Dwellers each time that they rebelled, with these troops. I acted with regard to that [for which his] majesty would show me favor [more than anything]. When it was said that backsliders because of something were among these foreigners in Antelope-Nose,10 I crossed over (30) in transports with these troops. I made a landing at the rear of the heights of the mountain range on the north of the land of the SandDwellers.11 While a full half of this army was (still) on the road, I arrived, I caught them all, and every backslider among them was slain.12
Middle Kingdom Egyptian
Contacts with Asia
The Egyptian Middle Kingdom saw a number of contacts with Asia, even though these do not loom large in inscriptional records? There was exceptionally vigorous activity in the area of the Sinai mines.1 Objects bearing the names of Twelfth Dynasty pharaohs or of members of their families have been found at Byblos, Beirut, and Ugarit on the Phoenician coast, and at Qatna in north central Syria.2 At the minimum, these may have been royal gifts from Egyptian pharaohs to friendly but independent princes in Asia. At the maximum, they may show some kind of Egyptian hegemony in the area. Of a number of monuments found in Asia and bearing the names of Egyptian officials, two examples will suffice. At Megiddo in Palestine there was found the statuette base of Thut-hotep, son of Kay and Sit-Kheper-ka, a High Priest of Thoth at Hermopolis and Nomarch of the Hare Nome, in which Hermopolis lay. This was an official whose career, somewhere between 1900 and 1850 B.C., was well known from his tomb in Egypt.3 At Ugarit (Ras Shamra) on the Phoenician coast there was found the statue group of the
Mayor of the Pyramid City, Vizier, and Chief Justice, Sen-Usert-onekh,... [to] whom [was given] the Gold of Honor in the presence of the courtiers.4 (The award of the "Gold of Honor" was normally
considerable number. Sinai probably would not fit the case. Uni's army must have moved into Palestine. 10 The word translated "backsliders" seems to come from a root meaning "slide, be slippery." In Egyptian propaganda these expeditions into other countries were always punitive against rebellion. The place "AntelopeNose"(?) cannot be located. The beast in question is not a gazelle; it is either a bubalis or a fallow deer. The place may have been a mountain range coming down to the sea, so-named by Egyptian sailors because of a characteristic profile. If so, the Carmel Range may be argued from the context which follows immediately. 11 Uni had gone by land against the "Sand-Dwellers." For a more northerly expedition his army travelled by boat. Where would a range come to the water so clearly as the Carmel Range?* 12 The translation understands that Uni landed, marched inland, and won a victory while the rear half of his army was still on the march.

made for service outside of Egypt The presence of the statues of such important officials in Palestine and Syria shows fairly intimate relations between Egypt and Asia. It is possible that they saw service as diplomatic agents or as resident Egyptian commissioners in areas of strong commercial and cultural interest. (The ties between Egypt and Byblos [Gebal] on the Phoenician coast were particularly close. By the end of the Middle Kingdom princes of Byblos, bearing Asiatic names, used Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions showing that they boasted the Egyptian title haty-a "Count," which in Egypt was a title conferred by the pharaoh. Even though we cannot be sure that the same applied in Phoenicia, the evidence of cultural leadership is clear. T w o of these Byblite princes were:)5 The Count of Byblos, Yep-shemu-ib, who repeats life, son of the Count, Ib-shemu, the triumphant. The Count of Byblos, Inten, who repeats life, son of the Count Reyen, the triumphant. (Our evidence on Asiatics in Egypt is disappointingly slight.

T h e Egyptian Mines in Sinai
Mines in the southern part of the Sinai peninsula provided Egypt with copper, which was an important material for the advancement of her culture, and with turquoise, which she prized for adornment. The Sinai mines were worked by Egypt from predynastic times down into the Twentieth Dynasty. The necessity for securing the ore provided a reason for external conquest and the beginnings of empire. One of the Egyptian records of mining activity is here given as an example* The inscription of Hor-ur-Re at Serabit el-Khadim in Sinai may be dated from other inscriptions in the same place to the reign of Amen-em-het III of the Twelfth Dynasty (about 18401790 B . C . ) . Published by Gardiner and Peet, The Inscriptions of Sinai, 1 (2nd ed., London, 1952), Pi. xxv A, No. 90, and by K. Sethe, Aegyplische Lcsestiicke (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1928), 86. Studied by V. Loret in Kimi, 1 (1928), 109-14, and by A. M. Blackman, in BIT AO, xxx (1930), 97-101. Translated by Breasted, AR, 1, §§733 38·
The majesty of this god1 despatched the Seal-Bearer of the God, the Overseer of the Cabinet, and Director of Lances, Hor-ur-Re, to this mining area. This land was reached in the 3rd month of the second season, although it was not at all the season for coming to this mining area.2 This Seal-Bearer of the God says to the officials who may come to this mining area at this season: Let not your faces flag because of it. Behold ye, HatHor turns it (5) to good* I have seen (it so) with regard to myself; I have experienced the like in myself. I came from Egypt with my face flagging? It was difficult, in my experience,4 to find the (proper) skin for it, when the land was burning hot, the highland was in summer, and the mountains branded an (already) blistered skin. When day broke for my leading to the camp* I kept on addressing the craftsmen about it: "How fortunate is he who is in this mining area!" But they said: "Turquoise is (10) always in the mountain, (but) it is the (proper) skin which has to be sought at this season. We used to hear the like, that ore is forthcoming at this season, but, really, it is the skin that is lacking for it in this difficult season of summer!"
All the time that I was leading (the men) to this mining area, the glory of the king was directing me.8 Then I reached this land, and I began the work under
10Sen-Usert II. The year would be about 1890 B.C. 11 The reading of the name and the location of this Asiatic area are uncertain.

good auspices. ( 1 5 ) My entire army returned complete; no loss had ever occurred in it. My face did not flag at the prospect of the work. I succeeded in grasping the best auspices. I left oil in the 1st month of the 3rd season,7 and brought away this noble stone. I had surpassed anyone (else) who had come or anything demanded. There was no: "Oh for a good skin!", (but) eyes were in festivity. It was better than at its normal season. Oiler (20) offerings to the Lady of Heaven; pray, satisfy ye Hat-Hor. If you do it, it will profit you. Ye shall surpass because of it; prosperity will be among you. I made my expedition very successfully. There (need be) no loudness of voice about my work: what I accomplished was the success of the expedition....
The Inscription of Khu-Sebek,
Called Djaa
The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom have left us no direct record of their activities in Asia. Therefore we prize any indirect records, such as the following reference to an Asiatic campaign by Sen-Usert III (about 1880-1840 B.C.). A stela found at Abydos, now No. 3306 in the Manchester Museum, England. Published by J. Garstang, El Arabah (London, 1901), Pis. rv-v, by T. E. Peet, The Stela of Sebe\-\hu (Manchester, 1914), and by K. Sethe, Aegyptische Lesestiic\e (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1928), 82-83. Translated by Breasted, AR, 1, §§676-87. For the real and potential enemies of Egypt at the end of the Middle Kingdom or shortly thereafter, see the Execration of Asiatic Princes (pp. 328-329 below).

C . ) , Khu-Sebek, probably over 70, led a frontier patrol at the Second Cataract, where he left an inscription recording the height of the Nile at Semneh (cf.

Then I smote a Nubian in Ken\ef in the presence of my town.8 Then I sailed north, following (the king) with six (men) of the Residence. Then he made (me) Deputy of Attendants, and a hundred persons were given to me as a reward. ( 1 ) His majesty proceeded northward to overthrow the Asiatics. His majesty reached a foreign country of which the name was Sekmem.7 His majesty too\ the right direction in proceeding to the Residence of life, prosperity, and health.8 Then Sekmem fell, together with the wretched Retenu.9 While I was acting as rear guard, then I rallied together the individuals of the army to fight with the Asiatics. Then I smote an Asiatic. Then I had his weapons taken by two individuals of the army, without deviating from the fight, for my face was forward and I did not turn my back to the Asiatic.10

The Hyksos in Egypt
The greatest indignity suffered by the ancient Egyptians was the conquest and rule of their land by foreigners out of Asia, the so-called "Shepherd Kings," or Hyksos (ca. 1725-1575 B.C.). There is surprisingly little in Egyptian literature, in view of the real change which this foreign domination made in the national psychology: the change from a confident sense of domestic security to an aggressive sense of national peril. To be sure, it was not in character for an ancient people to enlarge on defeat and subjection at the hands of others. Only the victorious elimination of peril would enter the literature. Josephus has given us something of the tradition of a harsh foreign rule.1
* Sen-Usert III. 6 Apparently he headed the personal bodyguard of the pharaoh. 6 His home contingent witnessed the feat. 7 Probably Shechem (cf. p. 329, n.8). 8 "His majesty gave the good beginning in." This expression is usually employed for the beginning of an enterprise. Here it seems that the pharaoh decided to leave the attack on Sekmem and return to Egypt. Then the Asiatic city fell after his departure. The only alternative is to assume that this sentence has been misplaced in the context, cf. n.io below, and note the necessity of reading this stela with lines 6-17 preceding lines 1-5. 9 Syria-Palestine in general. The implication is that Sekmem was a focal center of an Asiatic "rebellion" against Egypt. 10 Unless these lines are misplaced, they imply that the Egyptian army was under pressure on its return from the victory over Sekmem. 11 A. M. Blackman, in ]EA, n ( 1 9 1 5 ) , 1 3 - 1 4 , claims " a n indirect reference to Sesostris Ill's Syrian campaign" in a tomb scene showing "cattle of Retenu" in Egypt. Unfortunately, Blackman's "the cattle of Rlnw during the counting(?)" might equally be translated "the cattle at every counting," thus removing the assumed Asiatic country name.

In an inscription written almost a century after the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt, the queen Hat-shepsut (about 14861469 B.C.) gives some of the national sense of indignation. This inscription was carved on the facade of a temple of hers at Speos Artemidos (Istabl Antar) in Middle Egypt. A new edition by A. H. Gardiner, based on a copy by N. de G. Davies, JEA, xxxu (1946), 43-56, PI. vi, supplants previous presentations of the text by W. Golenischeff, in Recueil de travaux . . . , vi (1885), PL opp. p. 20, and by K. Sethe, TJr\unden der 18. Dynastie (Ur^·, iv, Leipzig, 1906), 11, 383-91, and the translation by Breasted, AR, 11, §§296-303. The extract below comes from lines 35-42 of this inscription.
Hear ye, all people and the folk as many as they may be, I have done these things through the counsel of my heart. I have not slept forgetfully, (but) I have restored that which had been ruined. I have raised up that which had gone to pieces formerly, since the Asiatics were in the midst of Avaris of the Northland,2 and vagabonds3 were in the midst of them, overthrowing that which had been made. They ruled without Re, and he4 did not act by divine command down to (the reign of) my majesty. (Now) I am established upon the thrones of Re. I was foretold for the limits of the years as a born conqueror.5 I am come as the uraeus-serpent of Horus, flaming against my enemies. I have made distant those whom the gods abominate, and earth has carried off their foot(prints). This is the precept of the father of [my] fathers, who comes at his (appointed) times, Re, and there shall not occur damage to what Amon has commanded. My (own) command endures like the mountains, (while) the sun disc shines forth and spreads rays over the formal titles of my majesty and my falcon is high above (my) name-standard for the duration of eternity.8

Another document on the Hyksos rule might perhaps be among folk tales treated above. It is a legend of later date, carrying the story of a contest between two rulers in Egypt. The Hyksos King Apophis in the Delta held suzerainty over the Egyptian King Seqnen-Re at Thebes. Apophis laid before Seqnen-Re one of those difficult problems which oriental literature loves, an insulting demand which threatened the dignity of the Egyptian ruler. We lack the end of the story, but the logic of the situation suggests that Seqnen-Re must have extricated himself from the indignity by returning to Apophis a proposition which counterchecked the problem set by the Hyksos king. Papyrus Sallier I (British Museum 10185), recto i i-iii 3; verso ii-iii, was written in the late Nineteenth Dynasty (end of the 13th century B.C.) in the colloquial language.7 It is facsimiled in Select Papyri in the Hieratic Character from the Collections of the British Museum, 1 (London, 1841), Pis. I-III, and in Facsimiles of Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum.
2 The Hyksos capital, Avaris, has been located, with some probability, at the same site as Tanis, San el-Hagar, in the northeast Delta, cf. pp. 232, 233, 252 below.* 3 "Wanderers, nomads, strangers." 4 Re. Gardiner, op.cit., 55, explains that the pharaoh "ascribed all his official acts to obedience to orders given him by the deity." 5 "As a she-becomes-(she)-seizes," a compound expression. 8 The gods have blessed Hat-shepsut's rule, confirming the names under which she ruled. 7 For example, the 2nd person singular is translated "you," rather than "thou."

N o w IT so HAPPENED THAT the land of Egypt was in distress. There was no Lord—life, prosperity, health!or king of the time. However, it happened that, as for King Seqnen-Re—life, prosperity, health!—he was Ruler —life, prosperity, health!—of the Southern City.8 Distress was in the town of the Asiatics, for Prince Apophislife, prosperity, health—was in Avaris, and the entire land was subject to him with their dues, the north as well, with all the good produce of the Delta. T H E N King Apophis—life, prosperity, health!—made him Seth as lord, and he would not serve any god who was in the land [except] Seth.9 And [he] built a temple of good and eternal work beside the House of [King Apo]phis—life, prosperity, health!—[and] he appeared [every] day to have sacrifices made . . . daily to Seth. And the officials [of the King]—life, prosperity, health! —carried wreaths, just exactly as is done (in) the temple of the Re-Har-akhti. Now then, as for (5) [King] A[pophis]—life, prosperity, health!—he wanted to [send] an irritating message (to) King Seqnen-Re[life, prosperity, health!—the] Prince of the Southern City.

[Apophis—life, prosperity, health!]—had summoned.
(Here the papyrus is badly broken. Apophis appears to be in consultation with his "scribes and wise men," and they seem to suggest the arrogant demand about the hippopotamus pool at Thebes. If Seqnen-Re should accede to this demand he would lose face, but he was in no position to ignore it. His only recourse would be to devise a logical but equally absurd riposte.)
["So we shall see the power of the god who] (ii 1) is with him as protector. He relies upon no god who is in the [entire land] except Amon-Re, King of the Gods."10

The W a r Against the Hyksos
The expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt was not accomplished in a single generation. The Egyptians had to find their strength in a series of campaigns. The account of one such revolt against the foreign rule is found in a characteristic setting: the record of a pharaoh's superior judgment and prowess. Kamose, who reigned just before the Eighteenth Dynasty (before 1570 B.C.), rebelled against a truce which divided Egypt between his Theban rule and the rule of the Hyksos at Avaris, rejected the cautious advice of his officials, and set out to win back a larger dominion. Although the end of the inscription is lost, it may be assumed that Ka-mose was recording some measure of success.
The Carnarvon Tablet I, found in western Thebes, is a schoolboy exercise almost contemporaneous with the events it relates. As will be indicated below, it may have been copied from Ka-mose's own stela. The tablet was published by Lord Carnarvon and H. Carter, Five Years' Exploration at Thebes (London, 1 9 1 2 ) , 36-37, Pis. XXVII-XXVIH, and by A. H. Gardiner, in JEA, III (1916), 95-110, Pis. xii-xui. It was translated by B. Gunn and A. H. Gardiner, in JEA, v (1918), 45-47, and by Erman, LAE, 52-54. That this schoolboy's tablet derived from a genuine historical inscription was demonstrated by the discovery of fragments of a stela found at Karnak, noted in ASAE, xxxv (1935), III, and published by P. Lacau, in ASAE, xxxix (1939), 245-71, Pis. XXXVH-XXXVHI. After one allows for the schoolboy's mistakes, the congruence of the two texts is marked.
11 Sic, but it seems probable that it should be read "me." 12 The story breaks off in the middle of a sentence.

The mighty king in Thebes, Ka-mose, given life forever, was the beneficent king. It was [Re] himself [who made him] king and who assigned him strength in truth. His majesty spoke in his palace to the council of nobles who were in his retinue: "Let me understand what this strength of mine is for! (One) prince is in Avaris, another is in Ethiopia, and (here) I sit associated with an Asiatic and a Negro!1 Each man has his slice of this Egypt, dividing up the land with me. I cannot pass by him as far as Memphis, the waters of Egypt, (but), behold, he has Hermopolis.2 No man can settle down, being despoiled by the imposts of the Asiatics. I will grapple with him, that I may cut open his belly! My wish is to save Egypt and to smite (5) the Asiatics!"
The great men of his council spoke: "Behold, it is Asiatic water as far as Cusae,3 and they have pulled out their tongues that they might speak all together,4 (whereas) we are at ease in our (part of) Egypt. Elephantine is strong, and the middle (of the land) is with us as far as Cusae. The sleekest of their fields are plowed for us, and our cattle are pastured in the Delta.8 Emmer is sent for our pigs. Our cattle have not been taken away. . . . He holds the land of the Asiatics; we hold Egypt. Should someone come and act [against us], then we shall act against him!"
Then they were hurtful to the heart of his majesty: " A s for this plan of yours,... He who divides the land with me will not respect me. [Shall I res]pect these Asiatics w h o . . . from him ? I [shall] sail north to reach Lower Egypt. [If I fight with] the Asiatics, success will come.8 If he things to be content with ... with weeping, the entire land.. . ( 1 0 ) . . .

In contexts of earlier times, the word Nehsi was rendered "Nubian," but is here rendered "Negro." See the article by H.

The Karnak stela adds the words "that they might speak," lacking in the tablet. 8 The word "pastured" is in this place on the stela, is misplaced on the tablet. Upper Egypt commonly had herds at pasture in the Delta, a practice permitted by the present truce. Emmer wheat, used largely for fodder, was grown chiefly in the Delta. 6 In this section of the text both tablet and stela are broken, making the sense uncertain. 7 Since this ends the argument, pharaoh's bolder counsel prevailed.

The Expulsion of the Hyksos
It is an irony of history that our best contemporaneous source on the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt comes from the biographical record of a relatively modest citizen of Upper Egypt, the captain of a Nile vessel. In relating his participation in the campaigns of Ah-mose I (about 1570-1545 B.C.) and of Thutmose I (about 1525-1495), Ah-mose, son of the woman Eben, tells of the successive attacks on the Hyksos in Egypt and then of the follow-up campaigns into Asia. The inscriptions in Ah-mose's tomb in el-Kab of Upper Egypt were copied in C. R. Lepsius, Dcn\maler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien (Berlin, 1849-59), IW> 12 b, c, d, and are also set forth in K. Sethe, TJrf^unden der 18. Dynastie (Urk., iv, Leipzig, 1905), 1, i-ii, accompanied by a translation (Leipzig, 1914). The text was studied by V. Loret, L'inscription d'Ahmes fils d'Abana (Bibliotheque d'titude, HI, Cairo, 1910). There are translations by Breasted, AR, 11, §§1-13, 81-82, and by B. Gunn and A. H. Gardiner, in JEA, v (1918), 48-54.
The commander of a crew, Ah-mose, son of Eben, the triumphant, says: I speak to you, all mankind, that I may let you know the favors which have come to me. I have been awarded gold seven times in the presence of the entire land, and male and female slaves in like manner, and I have been vested with very many fields.1 The reputation of a
8 The Madjoi mercenaries from south of Egypt were mounted high in the ships to spy out the enemy. 9 Nefrusi was a short distance north of Hermopolis. Nothing is known about Teti, the son of Pepi, whose Egyptian name suggests that he was a local vassal of the Hyksos king. See the next note. 10 These words are given on the stela. Perhaps: He (Ted) made the town of Nefrusi a nest for the Asiatic power, in Middle Egypt. II In token of submission and as part of the loot. 12 The reading of the place name—if such it is—and its location are uncertain. 18 The scanty remains cannot be translated.· See Supplement.

valiant man is from what he has done, not being destroyed in this land forever.2 He speaks thus: 1 had my upbringing in the town of el-Kab, my father being a soldier of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Seqnen-Re, the triumphant,3 his name being Bebe, (5) the son of (the woman) Ro-onet. Then I served as soldier in his place in the ship, "The Wild Bull," in the time of the Lord of the Two Lands: Neb-pehti-Re, the triumphant,4 when I was (still) a boy, before I had taken a wife, (but) while I was (still) sleeping in a net hammock/
But after I had set up a household, then I was taken on the ship, "Northern," because I was valiant. Thus I used to accompany the Sovereign—life, prosperity, health! —on foot, following his excursions in his chariot.® When the town of Avaris was besieged,7 then I showed valor on foot in the presence of his majesty. Thereupon I was appointed to the ship, "Appearing in Memphis." Then there was fighting on the water in the canal PaDjedku of Avaris. Thereupon I made a capture, (10) and I carried away a hand.8 It was reported to the king's herald. Then the Gold of Valor was given to me. Thereupon there was fighting again in this place. Then I made a capture again there and brought away a hand. Then the Gold of Valor was given to me over again. Then there was fighting in the Egypt which is south of this town.9 Thereupon I carried off a man (as) living prisoner. I went down into the water—now he was taken captive on the side of the town10—and crossed over the water carrying him. Report was made to the king's herald. Thereupon I was awarded gold another time. Then Avaris was despoiled. Then I carried off spoil from there: one man, three women, a total of four persons. Then his majesty gave them to me to be slaves.11 Then ( 1 5 ) Sharuhen was besieged for three years.12 Then his majesty despoiled it. Thereupon I carried off spoil from there: two women and a hand.

Gunn has pointed out (.JEA, xn [ 1 9 2 6 ] , 2 8 3 ) , this is a proverb which occurs three times in 18th dynasty inscriptions. 3 One of the pharaohs named Seqnen-Re in the 17th dynasty. 4 Ah-mose I. 8 Perhaps: "I was (still) sleeping with the phallic sheath attached"?

The Hyksos had introduced this war force into Egypt, cf. p. 233a above. 7 "When one sat down at the town of Avaris." We are abrupdy confronted with a curt statement that the Egyptians attacked the Hyksos in the latter's capital in the eastern Delta. It is significant that the following sentence names a boat as " H e Who Has (Ceremonial) Appearance in Memphis," suggesting that Memphis had already been recaptured by the Egyptians. 8 It was an Egyptian army custom to cut off the hand of a dead enemy as a proof of killing. 9 South of Avaris. This looks like a temporary retirement by the Egyptians. 10 Beside the town, but across a body of water from the Egyptian army. 11 In Ah-mose's "list of the male and female slaves of the spoil," most of the 19 names are good Egyptian. However, there appear a Pa-'Aam, "The Asiatic," a T'amutj, which is a feminine name similar to Amos, and an Ishtar-ummi, "Ishtar is My Mother." 12 "Then one sat down at Sharuhen in three years." Sharuhen (Josh. 1 9 : 6 ) lay in the extreme southwestern corner of the land of Canaan, in the territory of the tribe of Simeon. Perhaps it was modern Tell el-Far'ah. It seems that it was the first stronghold of the Hyksos on their departure from Egypt. "In three years" is a little strange and may mean in three successive campaigning seasons, rather than an unbroken siege.

The Asiatic Campaigns of
Thut-mose III
THE FIRST CAMPAIGN:
THE BATTLE OF MEGIDDO
Thut-mose III (about 1490-1436 B.C.) was the conquering pharaoh who set the Egyptian Empire on a foundation firm for almost a century. For twenty years he led campaigns into Asia almost every year. Some of these campaigns involved serious fighting, others were parades of strength. We have detailed information on his first campaign (perhaps 1468 B.C.), which attacked the focus of Asiatic resistance in the Canaanite city of Megiddo. The campaigns of subsequent years may have been just as fully recorded, but that detail has been condensed in the texts deriving from those years.1
A. THE ARMANT STELA
A red granite stela, broken and reused in later constructions, was found at Armant in Upper Egypt and published in R. Mond and O. H. Myers, The Temples of Armant. A Preliminary Survey (London, 1940), Pis. xi, No. 5; LXXXVIII, N O . 8; and

In the tomb of a certain Ah-mose called Pen-Nekhbet at el-Kab (Sethe, opxit., 3 5 ; Breasted, op.cit., §20), a notation runs: "I followed the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Neb-pehti-Re, the triumphant. I took booty for him in Djahi: 1 person and 1 hand." In a text of Ah-mose I's 22nd year in the quarries of Maasara, south of Cairo (Sethe, op.cit., 25; Breasted, opxit., §27), there is a record of the reopening of the quarries for stone to be used in certain temples. Part of the inscription runs: " T h e stone was dragged by the cattle which his [victories] thoughout the lands of the Fen'khu had carried off." The accompanying scene shows Asiatics driving the cattle. Djahi and Fenkhu apply to the Phoenician coast running down into Palestine and including the hinterland—further north than southern Palestine.

2 Hermonthis is modern Armant. s For the first twenty-two years of his reign, Thut-mose III had been overshadowed by the queen Hat-shepsut. Then he seized power with some show of violence and indulged his desire for military activity almost immediately. The present date is two and a half months earlier than Thut-mose's departure from the Egyptian frontier (n.9 below). Drower, op.cit., 1 8 3 , n. b, suggests that the present date may be the beginning of his sole reign. 4 Centrally Phoenicia, but here Syria-Palestine. 5 The formal departure from Memphis must have preceded the passing of the Egyptian frontier (n.9 below). 6 The pass through the Carmel range leading to Megiddo; cf. n.20 below.

Borchardt, Die Mittel zur zeitlichen Festlegung von Punkten der ägyptischen Geschichte (Quellen und Forschungen zur ägyptischen Geschichte, n, Cairo, 1 9 3 5 ) , 1 2 0 . T h e precise date will depend upon an establishment of what the ancient Egyptians meant by a "new moon." 1 0 Or T j a r u , the Egyptian frontier post, at or near modern Kantarah. 1 1 Sethe (see his justification in ZAeS, X L V I I [ 1 9 1 0 ] , 74-84) restores a context referring to the Hyksos rule in Egypt, as a forerunner of the present "revolt" in Palestine: " N o w it was a [long] time in years [that they had ruled this land, which had been] plundered, while every man was [tributary] before [their princes, who were in Avaris]." This is too specific for a restoration. See n.15 below. 12 "In the times of other (persons)." l s I n southwestern Canaan; sec p. 233b, n.12, above. 14 From southern Palestine to northern Syria. 15 Sethe's restoration ( n . n above) assumes three steps: (a) the Hyksos ruled Egypt from Avaris; (b) they were driven by Ah-mose I to Sharuhen in Palestine; (c) now, a century later, Asia is in revolt against Thut-mose III—that is, the enemies are these same Hyksos. B. Gunn and A. H. Gardiner, in JEA, v ( 1 9 1 8 ) , 54, n.2, reject Sethe's restoration as assuming too much. They translate the last sentence: "But it happened in other times that the garrison which was there (i.e. in Palestine) was in Sharühen, when from Yrd to the ends of the earth had fallen into rebellion against His Majesty." This would take the Hyksos out of the context and would assume that an Asiatic rebellion had pushed back an Egyptian garrison from a northern town (like Megiddo) to Sharuhen at the extreme south of Palestine. 16 Instead of the above translation, one may render: "as far as a town of the holding of the Ruler, [of which the name was] Gaza . . ." On Borchardt's reckoning, the Egyptians reached Gaza on April 25, 1468, having traveled at the respectable rate of 150 miles in 9 or 10 days. As this date was the anniversary of Thut-mose Ill's coronation, the year number changed from 22 to 23.

power, and in justification, in order to overthrow that wretched enemy,17 and to extend the frontiers of Egypt, according to the command of his father Amon-Re, the [valiant] and victorious, that he should capture. Year 23, ist month of the third season, day 1618—as far as the town of Yehem. [His majesty] ordered a conference with his victorious army, speaking as follows: "That [wretched] enemy (20) of Kadesh has come and has entered into Megiddo. He is [there] at this moment. He has gathered to him the princes of [every] foreign country [which had been] loyal to Egypt, as well as (those) as far as Naharin and M[itanni], them of Hurru, them of Kode, their horses, their armies, [and their people], for he says—so it is reported—'I shall wait [here] (25) in Megiddo [to fight against his majesty].' Will ye tell me [what is in your hearts] ? " " They said in the presence of his majesty: "What is it like to go [on] this [road] which becomes (so) narrow? It is [reported] that the foe is there, waiting on [the outside, while they are] becoming (more) numerous. Will not horse (have to) go after [horse, and the army] (30) and the people similarly? Will the vanguard of us be fighting while the [rear guard] is waiting here in Aruna, unable to fight?20 Now two (other) roads are here. One of the roads—behold, it is [to the east of] us, so that it comes out at Taanach. The other—behold, it is to the (35) north side of Djefti, and we will come out to the north of Megiddo.21 Let our victorious lord proceed on the one of [them] which is [satisfactory to] his heart, (but) do not make us go on that difficult road!"
Then messages [were brought in about that wretched enemy, and discussion was continued] of [that] problem on which they had previously spoken. That which was said in the majesty of the Court—life, prosperity, health!22—"I [swear], (40) as Re loves me, as my father Amon favors me, as my [nostrils] are rejuvenated with life and satisfaction, my majesty shall proceed upon this Aruna road! Let him of you who wishes go upon these roads of which you speak, and let him of you who wishes come in the following of my majesty! 'Behold,' they will say, these (45) enemies whom Re abominates, 'has
17 Not yet specified by name or title. The Prince of Kadesh—probably Kadesh on the Orontes—was the leader of the coalition against Egypt. See n.19 below. 18 May 7, 1468 (Borchardt). After leaving the Egyptian-held city of Gaza, the army's rate was notably slower through territory which was actually or potentially rebellious. Perhaps 80 miles were covered in 11 or 12 days. Yehem (possibly Jahmai or similar) is tentatively located by Nelson at Yemma on the south side of the Carmel ridge. 10 It is probable from the nature of this coalition and from Thut-mose's subsequent campaigns that this Kadesh was the city on the Orontes. The Barkal Stela (p. 238) gives the coalition as 330 princes, i.e. rulers of city states. Naharin and Mitanni (restoration not certain) were at the bend of the Euphrates. Hurru (or Kharu) was generally Syria-Palestine, and Kode the coast of north Syria and of Cilicia. 20 Nelson's topographic reconstruction gives the situation confronting the Egyptians. If they went straight ahead on the narrow track debouching just south of Megiddo, they had to go in single file and would be particularly vulnerable. Aruna, perhaps modern Tell 'Ära in the pass, was not "here" at Yehem, since it was a few miles further north. It was "here" on the southern side of the mountain range. 21 T w o safer mountain tracks were offered as alternatives, one debouching at Taanach, 4 or 5 miles southeast of Megiddo, and one debouching at an unknown point north (west) of Megiddo. 22 That is, the voice from the throne. The Court moved with the pharaoh.

his majesty set out on another road because he has become afraid of us ?'—so they will speak." They said in the presence of his majesty: "May thy father Amon, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, Presiding over Karnak, act [according to thy desire]! Behold, we are following thy majesty everywhere that [thy majesty] goes, for a servant will be after [his] lord."
[Then his majesty laid a charge] (50) upon the entire army: "[Ye] shall [hold fast to the stride of your victorious lord on] that road which becomes (so) n a r row. Behold, his majesty has taken] an oath, saying: 'I will not let [my victorious army] go forth ahead of my majesty in [this place!'" Now his majesty had laid it in his heart] that he himself should go forth at the head of his army. [Every man] was made aware (55) of his order of march, horse following horse, while [his majesty] was at the head of his army. Year 23, 1st month of the third season, day 19"—the awakening in [life] in the tent of life, prosperity, and health, at the town of Aruna.24 Proceeding northward by my majesty, carrying my father Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, [that he might open the ways] before me,25 while Har-akhti established [the heart of my victorious army] (60) and my father Amon strengthened the arm [of my majesty] Then [his] majesty issued forth26 [at the head of] his [army], which was [prepared] in many ranks. [He had not met] a single [enemy. Their] southern wing27 was in Taanach, [while their] nothern wing was on the south side [of the Qina Valley.26 Then] (65) his majesty rallied them saying·."... !

Now while the rear of his majesty's victorious army was (still) at [the town] of Aruna, the vanguard had come out into the [Qi]na Valley, and they filled the mouth of this valley. Then they said to his majesty—life, prosperity, health! —(75) "Behold, his majesty has come forth with his victorious army, and they have filled the valley.

Why they were drawn up opposite the mouth of the pass and yet had not held the pass against the thin Egyptian line is inexplicable. 28 The Qina is still represented by a brook flowing south of Megiddo. 29 The preceding verb means "summon," rather than "cry out." Therefore, we should have Thut-mose's rallying cry to his army behind him. When he said: "They are fallen!" he was anticipating the fall of the Asiatics, because they had failed to guard the pass.
shall not trouble our hearts [about] the rear of (80) our army." A halt was made by his majesty outside, [seated] there and awaiting the rear of his victorious army. Now the [leaders] had just finished coming forth on this road when the shadow turned.30 His majesty reached the south of Megiddo on the bank of the Qina brook, when the seventh hour was in (its) course in the day.31 Then a camp was pitched there for his majesty, and a charge was laid upon the entire army, [saying]: "Prepare ye! Make your weapons ready, since one32 will engage in combat with that wretched enemy in the morning, because one is . . . !" Resting in the enclosure of life, prosperity, and health.33 Providing for the officials. Issuing rations to the retinue. Posting the sentries of the army. Saying to them: "Be steadfast, be steadfast! Be vigilant, be vigilant!" Awakening in life in the tent of life, prosperity, and health. They came to tell his majesty: "The desert is well,34 and the garrisons of the south and north also!" Year 23, ist month of the third season, day 21, the day of the feast of the true new moon.35 Appearance of the king at dawn. Now a charge was laid upon the entire army to pass by . . . (85) His majesty set forth in a chariot of fine gold, adorned with his accoutrements of combat, like Horus, the Mighty of Arm, a lord of action like Montu, the Theban, while his father Amon made strong his arms. The southern wing of his majesty's army was at a hill south of [the] Qina [broo1(]y and the northern wing was to the northwest of Megiddo, while his majesty was in their center, Amon being the protection of his person (in) the melee and the strength of [Seth pervading] his members. Thereupon his majesty prevailed over them at the head of his army. Then they saw his majesty prevailing over them, and they fled headlong [to] Megiddo with faces of fear. They abandoned their horses and their chariots of gold and silver, so that someone might draw them (up) into this town by hoisting on their garments. Now the people had shut this town against them, (but) they [let down] garments to hoist them up into this town. Now, if only his majesty's army had not given up their hearts to capturing the possessions of the enemy, they would [have captured] Megiddo at this time, while the wretched enemy of Kadesh and the wretched enemy of this town were being dragged (up) hastily to get them into their town, for the fear of his majesty entered
30 It was noon, and the shadow clock should be turned around. The Egyptian van thus reached the Megiddo plain seven hours (see the next note) before the rear of the army emerged and Thut-mose could go into camp. 31 Presumably seven hours after the turning of the sun, although this is not certain. 82 Pharaoh. 33 These brief notations, without true sentence form, probably derive from the army's daybook. The royal enclosure was doubtless an elaborate pavilion such as that shown in scenes of Ramses II's campaigns, e.g. A. Erman and H. Ranke, Aegypten (Tübingen, 1 9 2 3 ) , 635. 34 Faulkner suggests that this is the equivalent of " T h e coast is clear." 35 Borchardt's date for the battle is May 1 2 , 1468. However, this rests on his understanding of "the true(?) new moon." In addition, Faulkner points out that "day 2 0 " seems to have dropped out since the departure from Aruna (n.23 above).

Then their horses and their chariots of gold and silver were captured as an easy [prey.86 Ran\s] of them were lying stretched out on their backs, like fish in the bight of a net, while his majesty's victorious army counted up their possessions. Now there was captured [that] wretched [enemy's] tent, which was worked [with silver],...
Then the entire army rejoiced and gave praise to Amon [because of the victory] which he had given to his son on [this day. They lauded] his majesty and extolled his victories. Then they presented the plunder which they had taken: hands,87 living prisoners, horses, and chariots of gold and silver and of painted wor\. (90) [Then his majesty commanded] his army with the words: "Capture ye [effectively, my] victorious [army]! Behold, [all foreign countries] have been put [in this town by the command] of Re on this day, inasmuch as every prince of every [northern] country is shut up within it, for the capturing of Megiddo is the capturing of a thousand towns! Capture ye firmly, firmly!..." [Orders were issued to the com]manders of the troops to pro[vide for their divisions and to inform] each [man] of his place.

Alternatively: "except to come out to surrender(?) at the door of their fortress." The siege lasted seven months (Barkal Stela, p. 238 below). Further information on the siege is given on a stela from the Ptah Temple at Karnak (Sethe, op.cit., 7 6 7 ) : " M y majesty returned from the foreign country of Retenu on the first occasion of the victories which my father Amon gave to me, when he gave me all the countries of Djahi, gathered together and shut up in a single town. The fear of my majesty pervaded their hearts; they were fallen and powerless when I reached them. There was no lack of runaways among them. I corralled them in a single town. I built a girdle wall around it, to cut them off from the breath of life." 39 "On the day in its name, in the name of the journey, and in the names of the commanders of [troops]." In the Theban tomb biography of "the Army Scribe" Tjaneni, who served under Thut-mose III (Sethe, opxit., 1004), we read: "I was the one who set down the victories which he achieved over every foreign country, put into writing as it was done."

[all] the princes whom the prowess of his majesty carried off, bearing their tribute of silver, gold, lapis lazuli, and turquoise, and carrying grain, wine, and large and small cattle for the army of his majesty, with one gang of them bearing tribute southward.41 Then his majesty appointed princes anew for [every town].... [List of the booty which his majesty's army carried off from the town of] Megiddo: 340 living prisoners and 83 hands; 2,041 horses, 191 foals, 6 stallions, and . . . colts; 1 chariot worked with gold, with a body of gold, belonging to that enemy, [ / ] fine chariot worked with gold belonging to the Prince of [Megiddo] . . . , and 892 chariots of his wretched army—total: 924; 1 fine bronze coat of mail belonging to that enemy, [ / ] fine bronze coat of mail belonging to the Prince of Meg[iddo, and] 200 [leather] coats of mail belonging to his wretched army; 502 bows; and 7 poles of meru-wood, worked with silver, of the tent of that enemy.

"Upper Retenu" properly stands for the mountain territory of north Palestine and southern Syria, and Yanoam seems to have been in the Lake Huleh area. The three towns would then be somewhere in that area. See A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica (London, 1 9 4 7 ) , 1, 168* ff.

C. THE BARKAL STELA
In his 47th year, Thut-mose III erected at Gebel Barkal near the Fourth Cataract a granite stela summarizing some of the achievements of his reign. It was published, with photograph, transcription, and translation, by G. A. and M. B. Reisner in ZAeS, LXIX (1933), 24-39, Pk· in"v- Only that part of the text which deals with the first campaign is translated below. Another extract will be found below under the eighth campaign.
I repeat further to you—hear, O people! (19) He48 entrusted to me the foreign countries of Retenu on the first campaign, when they had come to engage with my majesty, being millions and hundred-thousands of men, the individuals of every foreign country, waiting in their chariots—330 princes, every one of them having his (own) army. When they were in the Qina Valley and away from it, in a tight spot, good fortune befell me among them, when my majesty attacked them. Then they fled immediately or fell prostrate. When they entered into Megiddo, my majesty shut them up for a period up to seven months, before they came out into the open, pleading to my majesty and saying: "Give us thy breath, our lord! The countries of Retenu will never repeat rebellion another time!" Then that enemy and the princes who were with him sent out to my majesty, with all their children carrying abundant tribute: gold and silver, all their horses which were with them, their great chariots of gold and silver, as well as those which were plain, all their coats of mail, their bows, their arrows, and all their weapons of warfare. It was these with which they had come from afar to fight against my majesty, and now they were bringing them as tribute to my majesty, while they were standing on their walls, giving praise to my majesty, seeking that the breath of life might be given to them. (24) Then my majesty had administered to them an oath of fealtyf with the words: " W e will not repeat evil against Men-kheper-Re, who lives forever, our good lord, in our time of life, inasmuch as we have seen his power, and he has given us breath as he wishes! It was his father who did it—[Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands]—it was not the hand of man!"
46 An unknown object of wood. 47 Something like 450,000 bushels. 48 Amon-Re.
Then my majesty had them given leave to (go to) their cities. They all went on donkey (back), so that I might take their horses. I took captive the townspeople thereof for Egypt, and their possessions likewise.
D. FROM A DEDICATORY INSCRIPTION
In the Temple of Karnak Thut-mose III recorded the offerings and feasts which he established for the god Amon-Re in return for his victories. An extract from the beginning of this text gives further information on the first campaign. Perhaps during the seven months' siege of Megiddo, the pharaoh had been able to send a detachment north and establish a fortress outpost somewhere in the Lebanon. The text appears in Lepsius, op. cit.t 30b, and in Sethe, op.cit.y 739-40. It is translated in Breasted, opxrit., §§548-49.
. . . in the country of Retenu, in a fortress which my majesty built through his victories, a central point of the princes of Lebanon, of which the name shall be "Menkheper-Re-is-the-Binder-of-the-Vagabonds." Now when he landed at Thebes, his father Amon was [in joy] My majesty established for him a Feast of Victory anew, at the time when my majesty returned from the first victorious campaign, overthrowing the wretched Retenu and extending the frontiers of Egypt, in the year 23, as the first of the victories which he decreed to me.
SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS
Thut-mose III conducted at least sixteen campaigns into Asia in a period of twenty years. Some campaigns involved difficult fighting, some were mere parades of strength to organize the new empire. The records of some campaigns consist simply of statements of "tribute" to Egypt—from Retenu, Djahi, and Cyprus; from Nubia, Ethiopia, and Punt; and from Naharin, Hatti, Assyria, and Babylonia. Obviously, some of this was truly tribute from conquered countries, but some of it consisted of gifts from distant and sovereign lands. This translation includes only those campaigns having greater interest. For Thut-mose Ill's Hymn of Victory, see pp. 373-375 below. For a legend about the capture of Joppa under Thut-mose III, see pp. 22-23 above.
A. FIFTH CAMPAIGN
By his fifth campaign, in his 29th year, Thut-mose was moving as far north as the towns of Tunip and Ardata, somewhere in north Syria. From the "Annals" in Karnak: Sethe, opxit., 68588; bibliography on 680. Translation in Breasted, op.cit., §§45462.

Now there was a seizing of two ships,... loaded with everything, with male and female slaves, copper, lead, emery, and every good thing, after his majesty proceeded southward to Egypt, to his father Amon-Re, with joy of heart.5 Now his majesty destroyed the town of Ardata, with its grain. All its pleasant trees were cut down. Now [his majesty] found [the] entire [land of] Djahi, with their orchards filled with their fruit. Their (7) wines were found lying in their vats, as water flows, and their grains on the threshing floors, being ground. They were more plentiful than the sands of the shore. The army overflowed with its possessions. . . . Now his majesty's army was as drunk and anointed with oil every day as if at feasts in Egypt.
B. SIXTH CAMPAIGN
In his 30th year, Thut-mose moved against the focal center of opposition to Egypt, Kadesh on the Orontes. The word "destroy," used with reference to this town, is not to be taken literally; Thut-mose may have done no more than destroy its food supplies. The record of the year is notable for the statement of the policy of holding the heirs of Syrian princes in Egypt. From the "Annals" in Karnak: Sethe, opjcit., 689-90. Translation by Breasted, op.cit., §§463-67.
Year 30. Now his majesty was in the country of Retenu on his majesty's sixth victorious campaign. Arrival at the town of Kadesh. Destroying it. Felling its trees. Cutting down its grain. Proceeding by passing Reyet8 and reaching the town of Simyra.7 Reaching the town of Ardata. Doing the same to it. List of the tribute (10) brought to the glory of his majesty by the princes of Retenu in this year. Now the children of the princes and their brothers were brought to be hostages8 in Egypt. Now, whoever of these princes died, his majesty was accustomed to make his son go to stand in his place.9 List of the children of princes carried off in this year: 36 men; 181 male and female slaves; 188 horses: and 40 chariots, worked with gold and silver or painted.
c. SEVENTH CAMPAIGN
In his 31st year, Thut-mose captured the Phoenician town of Ullaza. He had now proceeded so far north that the control of the Sea was essential to the maintenance of empire. The record of this year tells of the Egyptian concern for holding the
3 A foreign word (perhaps Hittite) for chariot-warriors, cf. pp. 258, n.23; 263, n.12; and 469, n.io. 4 About 25 lb. Troy. 5 The loaded cargo-vessels were seized after the pharaoh had left for Egypt. Thus this does not state that he returned by water. See T. SaveSoderbergh, The Navy of the Eighteenth Egyptian Dynasty (Uppsala, 1 9 4 6 ) ,

6 Unknown. 7 A town on the north Phoenician coast. Its location and that of Ardata are still to be established with precision. 8 Or "captives"; less likely: "to be in strongholds." 9 Elsewhere in Karnak (p. 242 below), Thut-mose III listed "the foreign countries of Upper Retenu, . . . whose children his majesty carried off as living prisoners to the town . . . in Karnak." The name given to this section of Karnak is unfortunately unreadable, cf. pp. 247, 248-49, 257.

Now every port town which his majesty reached was supplied with good bread and with various (kinds of) bread, with olive oil, incense, wine, honey, fr[uit], . . .

That the list of them has not been put upon this monument is in order not to multiply words and in order to put their content in that place [in which] I made [them]}3 . . .
D. EIGHTH CAMPAIGN
In his 33rd year, Thut-mose achieved one of his most ambitious campaigns, crossing the bend of the Euphrates and fighting against "that enemy of the wretched Naharin." It is not certain whether this opponent was the King of Naharin or was a lesser prince. We have four sources for the events of this campaign. On the campaign in general, see the discussion by R. Faulkner, in JEA, xxxii (1946), 39-42.

10 This would be the last day of Thut-mose Ill's 31st year. See n.16 on the first campaign above. 11 Reading and location uncertain. Ullaza was a north Phoenician coast town. The Egyptians located a garrison here; cf. against n.28 below* 12 "Being a go-and-take." 13 On the army daybook, cf. against n.39 of the first campaign. 14 Sethe's restoration, used above, depends upon several other contexts. In a broken Karnak inscription (Sethe, opxit., 1 8 8 ) , there is reference to ". . . [the dis]trict of Qatna on the 8th victorious campaign." Qatna lay northeast of modern Homs. Part of the restoration depends upon the Hymn of Victory (p. 374 below): "Thou hast crossed the waters of the Great Bend of Naharin," and on an inscription on the obelisk now in Istanbul (Sethe, opxit., 5 8 7 ) : " H e who crossed the Great Bend of Naharin in valor and victory at the head of his army and made a great slaughter." The general sense of the restoration is probably correct. On Naharin, see A. H Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica, 1, 1 7 1 * ff.
1 5 Thut-mose I (ca. 1525-1495 B . C . ) . Thut-mose Ill's 33rd year should be about 1458 B.C. 16 In Egypt this word would mean both "go north" and " g o downstream." Since the Euphrates flows south, the direction is uncertain in the present context. See A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica (London, 1947), 1, 160* ff.

They come to him with bowed head, seeking his breath of life. He is a king, valiant like Montu;20 a taker, from whom no one can take, who crushes all rebellious countries. There is none who can protect them in that land of Naharin, which its lord abandoned because of fear. I desolated his towns and his tribes and set fire to them. My majesty made them mounds, and their (re)settlement will never take place. I captured all their people, carried off as living prisoners, the (10) cattle thereof without limit, and their goods as well. I took away the very sources of life, (for) I cut down their grain and felled all their groves and all their pleasant trees. . . . I destroyed it; it became a . . . upon which there are no trees.

T h e only other element of interest in the "Annals" of this year is in the tribute of an Asiatic country of which the name is lost: "4 birds of this country—now they [give] birth every day." This, as Sethe has pointed out (Die älteste Erwähnung des Haushuhns in einem ägyptischen Texte [Festschrift für F. K. Andreas, Leipzig, 1 9 1 6 ; 1 0 9 ] ) , b the earliest record of the domestic hen. 20 The Egyptian god of war. 21 "God's L a n d " was the east in general.

Then my majesty set up on that mountain of Naharin my stela, which was dug out of the mountain on the west side (of) the Great Bend When I proceeded ( 1 5 ) south to Egypt, after I had put the sword (to) Naharin, great was the terror in the mouth of the Sand-Dwellers.25 Their doors were closed because of it; they would not come out into the open for fear of the B u l l . . . . Still another instance of the victory which Re decreed to me: he repeated for me a great (feat of) valor (at) the water hole of Ni, when he let me make droves of elephants and my majesty fought them in a herd of 120.

I have not given (any) of it to the Asiatics, (for) it is a wood which he loves....
D.-D THE BIOGRAPHY OF AMEN-EM-HEB
Amen-em-heb was an Egyptian soldier of moderate military rank, who has left us a lively account of his deeds of valor in following Thut-mose III. His autobiography is painted on the walls of his tomb (No. 85) in Thebes. Although he gives us no chronology, it has been argued that his narrative "almost certainly deals with the events of this one campaign in chronological order, the only exception being the second assault on Kadesh, which is the last batde in which Amenemhab fought" (A. H. Gardiner, on the authority of R. Faulkner, in JEA, xxxn [1946], 39). The text appears in W. M. Miiller, Egyptological Researches (Washington, 1906), 1, Pis. xxxm-xxxix, and in Sethe, opxit., 889-97; a translation in Breasted, op.cit., §§574-92. See also A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica (London,

I made captives in the country of (5) Negeb.291 took three men, Asiatics, as living prisoners. When his majesty reached Naharin, I took three men captive there, so that I might put them before thy30 majesty as living prisoners. Again I made captives within this campaign in the country, the Ridge of Wan, on the west of Aleppo. I took Asiatics as living prisoners: 13 men; 70 live asses; 13 bronze battle-axes; and . . . of bronze, worked with gold. Again I took booty within this campaign in the country of Carchemish. I took (10) . . . as living prisoners, and I crossed over the water of Naharin, while they were in my hand . . . ; I [placed] them before my lord. Then he rewarded me with a great reward; the list thereof:... I saw the victory of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Men-kheper-Re, given life, in the country of Sendjer,31 when he made [a great] slaughter [among] them. I made captives in the king's presence; I took a hand there, and he gave me the Gold of Favor; the list thereof:..., and two rings of silver. Again I saw how valiant he was, while I was in his retinue, when [he] captured the [city of] (15) Kadesh, without my swerving from the glace where he was. I took two men, maryanu,3Z as [living prisoners and set them] before the king, the Lord of the Two Lands: Thut-mose-Ruler-of-Thebes, living forever.

Then my lord gave to me the Gold of Favor; the list thereof: two necklaces, four rings, two flies, and one lion of gold; a female slave and a male slave. Again [I saw] another successful deed which the Lord of the Two Lands accomplished in Ni. He hunted 120 elephants at their mud hole.TM Then the biggest elephant which was among them began to fight before the face of his majesty. I was the one who cut off his hand34 while he was (still) alive, (25) in the presence of his majesty, while I was standing in the water between two rocks. Then my lord rewarded me with gold: . . . , and five pieces of clothing. Then, when the Prince of Kadesh sent out a mare, which [was swift] on her feet and which entered among the army,371 ran after her on foot, carrying my dagger, and I (ripped) open her belly.

Then my lord again rewarded me for it, with every good thing of heart's satisfaction. Now really, I made these captures while I was a soldier of [User-het-A]mon.38...
E. NINTH CAMPAIGN
The success of Thut-mose's first eight campaigns seems to be reflected in the dull, statistical character of the records of the final campaigns. They consist chiefly of lists of "tribute" from dependent or friendly countries. The 9th campaign, in the 34th year, contains a slighdy different statement about pharaoh's concern for the harbors of Phoenicia. The references are to the "Annals" in Karnak: Sethe, opxit., 707; Breasted, opxit., §492.
Now every port town of his majesty was supplied with every good thing which [his] majesty received [in the country of Dja]hi, with Keftiu, Byblos, and Sektu ships of cedar,39 loaded with columns and beams, as well as (37) large timbers for the [major wood]working of his majesty
F. FINAL CAMPAIGN
In his 42nd year, Thut-mose conducted his 16th or 17th campaign, the last listed. Apparently he met somewhat more resistance than in other late campaigns. The references are to the "Annals" in Karnak; Sethe, opxit., 729-34, with antecedent bibliography on 724; Breasted, op.cit., §§528-40.

[Now his majesty captured the foreigners] of the wretched Naharin, who were auxiliaries among them, together with their horses: 691 individuals; 29 hands; 48 horses,... (20) . . . Now his majesty commanded that the victories which he had accomplished from the year 23 to the year 42 should be set down at the time when this monument was established in this chapel, in order that he might achieve "given-life-forever."
38 The sacred barge of Amon at Thebes. The implication seems to be that Amen-em-heb was only an official of relatively low rank. The text goes on to record the death of Thut-mose III and Amen-em-heb's elevation to the rank of "Lieutenant of the Army" under Amen-hotep II. 30 Keftiu was Crete—or the eastern Mediterranean coast generally—and Byblos was trie Phoenician town. For the identification of die Sektu ships with Ugaritic and Hebrew (Isaiah, 2 : 1 6 ) words for ships, see the references given by W. F. Albright in J AOS, L X X I ( 1 9 5 1 ) , 261. The names of the three vessels indicate the commercial carriers of the time within the eastern Mediterranean. For tentative adjustments in dates see p. xviii. 40 Phoenicians. 41 Modern 'Arqah, northeast of Tripoli. 42 These words do not actually claim the capture of Kadesh itself, although that may have been one of the three towns.

Lists of Asiatic Countries
Under the Egyptian Empire
The conqueror Thut-mose III initiated the custom of listing the Asiatic and African countries which he had conquered or over which he claimed dominion. In the Temple of Amon at Karnak three of his lists bear superscriptions. The texts are published in K. Sethe, Urkunden der 18. Dynastie (Urkiv, Leipzig, 1907), 780-81, with translations in Breasted, AR, 11, §402.
(a) Roster of the countries of Upper Retenu which his majesty shut up in the town of the wretched Megiddo, whose children his majesty carried off as living prisoners to the town . . . in Karnak,1 on his first victorious campaign, according to the command of his father Amon, who led him to the good ways. (b) All the mysterious lands of the marshes of Asia which his majesty carried off as living prisoners, while he made a great slaughter among them, (lands) which had not been trodden by other kings except for his majesty. The reputation of a valiant man is from [what he has done], not being destroyed in this land [forever].2 (c) Roster of the countries of Upper Retenu which his majesty shut up in the town of the wretched Megiddo, whose children his majesty carried off as living prisoners to the town of Thebes, to fill the workhouse of his father Amon in Karnak, on his first victorious campaign, according to the command of his father Amon, who led him to the good ways.
Subsequent kings followed Thut-mose III in compiling such lists. The result is only a partial historical gain. Identifications are often difficult or impossible, and some of the later lists are suspect as having a strong fictional coloring. Selections from these lists are given below, with attempted identifications. It will be understood that the name is not always the biblical site; it may be a Kadesh, a Hamath, or a Geba. Those names which are checked with numbers derive from the longer lists and—with the exception of Ramses III—may more truly represent historical achievement than those names which occur in briefer lists of strong propagandist^ force (here checked with x). The names are taken from J. Simons, Handbook for the Study of Egyptian Topographical Lists Relating to Western Asia (Leyden, 1937), in which antecedent bibliography is given. The numbers used below are those of Simons' lists. Important for the identification of place names are M. Burchardt, Die altl{anaandischen Fremdworte und Eigennamen im ägyptischen (Leipzig, 1909), and W. F. Albright, The Vocalization of the Egyptian Syllabic Orthography (New Haven, 1934).*

A Trip to the Lebanon for Cedar
An official of Thut-mose III has left us an inscription—unfortunately badly damaged—on a commission which he undertook to secure cedar from the Lebanon. The inscription appears in the tomb of the Chief Treasurer Sen-nefer (No. 99 at Thebes). The text appears in K. Sethe, Urkunden der 18. Dynastie (Ur iv, Leipzig, 1906), in, 531-36, and was studied by Sethe, Eine
* On the historical value of the names Yaa and Qedem, A. H. Gardiner, Notes on the Story of Sinuhe (Paris, 1 9 1 6 ) , 1 5 5 , points out that in this one list the two names "occur beside one another, obviously reminiscences of the story of Sinuhe and without further historical value." cf. p. 19 above.

Pharaoh as a Sportsman
The following texts have place in the record of the Egyptian Empire because they present to us the invincible being who conquered and held foreign countries. As a god-king, he was placed beyond any mortals of his day. Yet he led his armies into batde and arrows were aimed at him. He had to present himself and he had to be presented by the dogma of the state as unsurpassed and unsurpassable in physical prowess. In addition to the accumulating legend of his triumphs in batde, a legend was fostered of his invincibility in competitive sport.
a
The first document deals with Thut-mose III (about 14901436 B.C.) and is extracted from his Armant Stela, for which the bibliography was given on p. 234 above.
(4) He shot at an ingot of copper, every shaft being split like a reed. Then his majesty put a sample there in the House of Amon, being a target of worked copper of three fingers in thickness,1 with his arrow therein. When it had passed through it, he made three palms2 come out at the back of it, in order to grant the request of those who followed: the success of his arms in valor and victory. I speak to the water of what he did,3 without lying and without equivocation therein, in the face of his entire army, without a phrase of boasting therein. If he spent a moment of recreation by hunting in any foreign country, the number of that which he carried off is greater than the bag of the entire army. He killed seven lions by shooting in the completion of a moment. He carried off a herd of twelve wild cattle within an hour, when breakfast time had taken place,
1 In the lost context there must have been reference to the goddess of Byblos, whom the Egyptians equated with their Hat-Hor. The "presentations" to her are a polite statement of the payment for cedar. The term \henti-she, here translated "forest-preserve," was used in Egypt for royal domains. 2 Slightly over 100 feet long.

The pharaoh who has left us the most numerous records of his physical prowess was Amen-hotep II (about 1447-1421 B.C.).8 A stela recendy discovered near the Sphinx at Gizeh gives the most telling record of his triumphs at sport. It was published by Selim Hassan in ASAE, xxxvn (1937), 129-34, r"n> and by A. Varille in BIFAO, XLI (1942), 31-38, PI. 1. It was translated by G. Steindorff and K. C. Seele, When Egypt Ruled the East (Chicago, 1942), 68-70. The conventional praise of the pharaoh in the first ten and a half lines is here omitted.
Now, further, his majesty appeared as king as a goodly youth.9 When he had matured10 and completed eighteen years on his thighs in valor, (12) he was one who knew every task of Montu:11 there was no one like him on the field of battle. He was one who knew horses: there was not his like in this numerous army. There was not one therein who could draw his bow.12 He could not be approached in running. Strong of arms, one who did not weary when he took the oar, he rowed at the stern of his falcon-boat as the strode for two hundred men." When there was a pause, after they had attained half an iter's course,14 they were weak, their bodies were limp, they could not draw a breath, whereas his majesty was (still) strong under his oar of twenty cubits in its length.15 He left off and moored his falcon-boat (only after) he had attained three iters in rowing,19 without letting down ( 1 5 ) in pulling. Faces were bright at the sight of him, when he did this. He drew three hundred stiff bows in comparing the work of the craftsmen of them, in order to distinguish the ignorant from the wise. When he had just come from doing this which I have called to your attention,
4 The pharaoh wore a bull's tail in ceremonial appearance. There follows the account of the elephant hunt, translated on p. 240 above.
5 Also depicted at the temple of Armant (Mond and Myers, op.cit., Pis. ix, XCIII; translation by Drower, pp. 159-60) is a rhinoceros, which may be this same beast, although the dating of the scene is uncertain. The depiction of the animal is accompanied by its dimensions. 8 A Sudanese place name which occurs elsewhere, but which cannot be located. 7 That is, the stela at the Euphrates, p. 239 above. There follows the text about the Batde of Megiddo, p. 234 above. 8 Drower, in Mond and Myers, op.cit., 184, n. e, gives a bibliography of the texts on the pharaoh as a sportsman. They are also treated by B. Van der Walle, Let rois sportifs de Vancienne tgypte, in Chronique d'tgypte, No. 26 ( 1 9 3 8 ) , 234-57. N e w material to be added to these is in the Memphis Stela of Amen-hotep II, p. 246 below. 9 For an uncertain number of years he was coregent with his father, Thutmose III. 10 "When he had counted his body," in the sense of developing to maturity. 1 1 The god of war. 12 The same claim in his Amada inscription, p. 247 below. Breasted, AR, n, p. 3 1 0 , n. d, calls attention to the legend in Herodotus (111, 2 1 ) that Cambyses could not draw the bow of the king of Ethiopia. 18 The "falcon-boat" was the king's official barge. The word translated "stroke" may come from a root, "to destine, to determine." 14 Probably about a kilometer, five-eighths of a mile. 15 About 34 feet. 16 Probably about 4 miles.
he entered into his northern garden and found that there had been set up for him four targets of Asiatic copper of one palm in their thickness,17 with twenty cubits18 between one post and its fellow. Then his majesty appeared in a chariot like Montu in his power. He grasped his bow and gripped four arrows at the same time. So he rode northward, shooting at them like Montu in his regalia. His arrows had come out on the back thereof while he was attacking another post. It was really a deed which had never been done nor heard of by report: shooting at a target of copper an arrow which came out of it and dropped to the ground—except for the king, rich in glory, whom [Amon] made strong, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Aa-khepru-Re, heroic like Montu. Now when he was (still) a lad,19 he loved his horses and rejoiced in them. It was a strengthening of the heart to work them, to learn their natures, to be skilled in training them, and to enter into their ways. When (it) was heard (20) in the palace by his father, the Horus: Mighty Bull, Appearing in Thebes,20 the heart of his majesty was glad when he heard it, rejoicing at what was said about his eldest son, while he said in his heart: "He it is who will act as Lord for the entire land, without being attacked, while the heart moves in valor, rejoicing in strength, though he is (only) a goodly, beloved youth. He is not yet sagacious; he is not (yet) at the time of doing the work of Montu. He is (still) unconcerned with carnal desire,21 (but) he loves strength. It is a god who puts (it) into his heart to act so that Egypt may be protected for him and so that the land defers to him."22 Then his majesty said to those who were at his side: "Let there be given to him the very best horses in my majesty's stable which is in Memphis, and tell him: Take care of them, instil fear into them, make them gallop, and handle them if there be resistance to thee!'" Now after it had been entrusted to the King's Son to take care of horses of the king's stable, well then, he did that which had been entrusted to him. Rashap and Astarte23 were rejoicing in him for doing all that his heart desired.
He trained horses without their equal: they would not grow tired when he took the reins, nor would they sweat (even) at a high gallop. He would harness with the bit in Memphis and stop at the rest-house of (25) Harmakhis,24 (so that) he might spend a moment there, going around and around it and seeing the charm of this rest-house of Khufu and Khaf-Re, the triumphant. His heart desired to perpetuate their names, (but) he still put it into his heart—so he said—until that which

his father Re had decreed to him should have come to pass.25
After this, when his majesty was made to appear as king, the uraeus-serpent took her place upon his brow, the image of Re2a was established at its post, and the land was as (in) its first state, at peace under their lord, Aa-khepru-Re. He ruled the T w o Lands, and every foreign country was bound under his soles. Then his majesty remembered the place where he had enjoyed himself in the vicinity of the pyramids and of Harmakhis, and One27 ordered that it be caused that a resthouse be made there, in which was set up a stela of limestone, the face of which was engraved with the Great Name of Aa-khepru-Re, beloved of Harmakhis, given life forever.
The Asiatic Campaigning
of Amen-hotep II
Amen-hotep II (about 1447-1421 B.C.) gloried in his reputation for personal strength and prowess. His records therefore contrast with those of his predecessor and father, Thut-mose III, in emphasizing individual achievement, cf. the translations immediately preceding.
A. THE MEMPHIS AND KARNAK STELAE
There are two sources, in partial duplicate, for Amen-hotep's first and second campaigns into Asia. The more extensive text was recendy discovered at Memphis, having been reused by a prince of the Twenty-second Dynasty as the ceiling of his burial chamber about 875 B.C. It was published by A. M. Badawi, Die neue historische Stele Amenophis II, in ASAE, XLII (1943), 1 23, PI. 1. The more damaged source is a stela standing at the south of the Eighth Pylon at Karnak. It was translated, with notes on antecedent bibliography, by Breasted, AR, 11, §§781-90. Both stelae were hacked up under the Amarna Revolution and restored in the Nineteenth Dynasty—badly restored, in the case of the Karnak stela. Both stelae were collated in 1946, the Memphis stela being mounted in the Cairo Museum under exhibition No. 6301. The line numbers below follow the Memphis stela*A study of both stelas by E. Edel, ZDPV, LXIX (1953), 97-176.

1 Around 1440 B.C., this date will have fallen in the latter part of May. The translator finds it impossible to reconcile the dates in these several stelae. The Memphis stela places the first campaign in Amen-hotep II's 7th year, the second in his 9th year. The Amada stela below is dated in his 3rd year, to record a celebration in Egypt after the return from the first campaign! Further, it is understood that Amen-hotep was coregent with his father, Thut-mose III, for a minimum of 1 year and up to a possible 11 years. A possible reconciliation would be that the 7th year after the coregency began was the 3rd year of sole reign.· See the criticism of this reconciliation by D. B. Redford, JEA, LI (1965), 120-21.
His throne, for He built him as strong and powerful in distinction to that which had been. His majesty has trod Naharin, which his bow has crushed, being devastated, carrying off by victory and power, like Montu2 adorned with his equipment. His heart is at rest when he sees them, (for) he has cut off the heads of the attackers. His majesty proceeded to Retenu on his first victorious campaign to extend his frontiers, made from the property of them who are not loyal to him, his face terrible like (that of) Bastet,8 like Seth in his moment of raging. His majesty reached Shamash-Edom.4 He hacked it up in a short moment, like a lion fierce of face, when he treads the foreign countries.® (His) majesty was in his chariot, of which the name was: "Amon, the valiant . . ."a List of the booty of his arm: living Asiatics: 35; catde: 22J His majesty crossed the Orontes8 ( 5 ) on dangerous waters, like Rashap.9 Then he turned about to watch his rear, and he saw a few Asiatics coming furtively,10 adorned with weapons of warfare,11 to attack the king's army. His majesty burst after them like the flight of a divine falcon. The confidence of their hearts was slackened, and one after another fell upon his fellow, up to their commander.12 Not a single one was with his majesty, except for himself with his valiant arm. His majesty killed them by shooting.18 He returned thence, his heart glad like Montu the valiant, when he had triumphed.14 List of what his majesty captured within this day: two princes and six maryanu,15 in addition to
2 God of war. * The slaughtering cat-goddess. 4 T h e Karnak variant, abusively restored (ASAE, iv [ 1 9 0 3 ] , 126-32): "the town of Shamash-Edom." This town occurs also in the geographical lists of Thut-mose III (p. 243 above), in an association which seems to place it in Palestine* 5 Karnak variant: "His majesty achieved a happy feat there, (for) his majesty himself took booty. Now he was like a fierce lion, smit[ing the] foreign countries [of Ret]en[u]. . . ."
9 An argument with regard to this apparendy corrupted passage and the consequent name of the pharaoh's horses and chariot was undertaken by E. Drioton in ASAE, X L I V ( 1 9 4 5 ) , 5"?» AND B. Grdseloff in ibid., XLV ( 1 9 4 7 ) 1 107-15. Our translation agrees in part with GrdselofFs rendering. 7 Karnak variant: " l i s t of the booty of his majesty himself on this day: 26 (perhaps 18) living Asiatics; 19 cattle." 8 Karnak variant: " 1 s t month of the third season, day 26. His majesty's crossing the ford of the Yersct on this day, (when) [he] caused to cross " The date is the day following the dare given at the beginning of the Memphis stela. The writing Yerset for Yernet, "Orontes," is probably a product of ignorant restoration under the 19th dynasty. 9 On the Asiatic god Rashap, sec p. 250 below. The Karnak variant: ". . . being dangerous, like the strength of Montu, the Theban." Drioton, op.cit., 9-12, tentatively renders our "dangerous" above as "shaking with fury"; Grdseloff, op.cit., 115-20, emends the same to "at a gallop." 10 Karnak variant: "his majesty turned about to see the ends of the earth. (Th)en his majesty saw a few Asiatics coming in chariots." 11 For once, the Karnak variant is preferable, since it adoms the pharaoh: "Now his majesty was adorned with lib weapons of warfare, and his majesty became terrible in proportion to the hidden strength of Seth in his hour." 12 Karnak variant: "They quailed when (they) saw his majesty alone . . . among them. Then his majesty felled their commander himself with his battle-axe." Karnak variant follows this with a text garbled by the restoration under the 19 th dynasty. 18 Karnak variant: "Now he carried off this Asiatic at the side [of his chariot, and also captured] his team, his chariot, and all his weapons of warfare." 14 Karnak variant: "His majesty returned in joy of heart (like) his father Amon, who had given to him the earth, when he had triumphed." 15 The torn maryanu (related to the Vedic mdrya "male, noble") was used for Asiatic warriors in this period, cf. p. 22, n.i. Karnak variant: "List of what his majesty captured on this day: . . . , the 2 horses, 1 chariot, a coat of mail, 2 bows, a quiver filled with arrows, . . . and an inlaid axe."

His majesty, going south, reached Ni.18 Its prince and all his people, male as well as female, were at peace with his majesty, (for) their faces had received a bedazzlementHis majesty reached Ikat.18 He surrounded everyone rebellious to him and killed them, like those who have never existed, put on (their) side, upside down. He returned thence in joy of heart, with this entire country in bondage to him. Rest in the tent of his majesty19 in the neighborhood of Tjerekh on the east of Sheshrem. The settlements of Mendjet20 were plundered. His majesty reached Hetjra.20 Its prince came out in peace to his majesty, (10) bringing his children and all his goods. Submission was made to his majesty by Unqi.21 His majesty reached Kadesh. Its prince came out in peace to his majesty. They were made to take the oath of fealty, and all their children as (well). Thereupon his majesty shot at two targets of copper in hammered worlj, in their presence, on the south side of this town.22 "Excursions were made in Rebi20 in the forest, and there were brought back gazelles, maset, hares, and wild23 asses without their limit.
His majesty proceeded by chariot to Khashabu,24 alone, without having a companion. He returned thence in a short moment, and he brought back 16 living maryanu on the two sides of his chariot, 20 hands at the foreheads of his horses, and 60 cattle being driven before him. Submission was made to his majesty by this town. While his majesty was going south in the midst of the Plain of Sharon 25 he met a messenger of the Prince of Naharin, carrying a letter of clay at his throat.26 He took him as a living prisoner at the side of his chariot. His
1S Karnak variant: "2nd month of the third season, day 10. Advancing on . . . [by going sou]th toward Egypt. His majesty proceeded by chariot against the town of Ni." The date will have been two weeks after the fording of the Orontes. Ni was somewhere near the bend of the Euphrates; cf. p. 240, n.i-8 above. The Karnak text tends to confirm the meaning, "to go south," for em \henut, since movement toward Egypt would be south, but the same doubt arises as on p. 239, n.16 above. 17 Karnak variant: " N o w the Asiatics of this town, male as well as female, were upon their wall, praising his majesty and . . . the good god." 18 Karnak variant: " N o w his majesty heard that certain [of] the Asiatics who were in thi town of Ikat were conspiring to accomplish the abandonment of his majesty's garrison . . . in this town, in order to turn upside down . . . who was loyal to his majesty. . . . Then everyone rebellious to him was surrounded in this town. . . . He [killed] them immediately, and he quieted [this] town, . . . the whole country." The two texts agree on the writing of the town Ikat, the location of which is unknown. By a simple emendation one could read Ikarit, Ugarit. 19 Karnak variant: "2nd month of the third season, day 20. . . . in the encampment which was made. . . ." The date would be 10 days after that of n.16 above. 20 Unknown. 21 Territory between the Euphrates and the sea. Thus the Kadesh which follows was Kadesh on the Orontes. 22 Emphasizing the pharaoh's skill at sport (pp. 243-45 above), in order to impress the locals. 23 Here written khem, with determinative of motion, as if related to the word "ignorant," but probably related to the later 'aa shema "roaming = wild ass." The maset animal is unknown. 24 Egyptian Kh-sh-b, cuneiform Khashabu, temptingly identified by Badawi with Hasbeya, west of Mt. Hermon. 25 The stela is broken at this point, but pa 'am . . w sau-ri-na is probably visible, to be completed to "the 'Emeq of Sharon." 26 Although the text shows sh'atu in, there can be little doubt that it is to be corrected to sh'at sin "a letter of clay." " A t his throat" would mean "hanging around his neck," probably in a pouch.
majesty went forth in chariot by a track" to Egypt, ( 1 5 ) with the marya28 as a living prisoner in the chariot alone with him. His majesty reached Memphis, his heart joyful, the Mighty Bull. List of this booty:29 maryanu·. 550; their wives: 240; Canaanites: 640; princes' children: 232; princes' children, female: 323; favorites30 of the princes of every foreign country: 270 women, in addition to their paraphernalia for entertaining the heart, of silver and gold, (at) their shoulders; total: 2,214;" horses: 820; chariots: 730, in addition to all their weapons of warfare. Now the God's Wife, King's Wife, and King's [Daughter] beheld the victory of his majesty.82 Year 9, 3rd month of the first season, day 25.38 His majesty proceeded to Retenu on his second victorious campaign, against the town of Apheq.34 It came out in surrender to the great victory of Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health! His majesty went forth by chariot, adorned with weapons of warfare, against the town of Yehem.35 Now his majesty captured the settlements of Mepesen, together with the settlements of Khettjen, two towns on the west of Socho.36 Now the Ruler was raging like a divine falcon, his horses flying like a star of heaven. His majesty entered, and (20) its princes, its children, and its women were carried off as living prisoners, and all its retainers similarly, all its goods, without their limit, its cattle, its horses, and all the small cattle (which) were before him.
Thereupon his majesty rested. The majesty of this august god, Amon, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, came before his majesty in a dream, to give valor to his son, Aa-khepru-Re. His father Amon-Re was the magical protection of his person, guarding the Ruler.
27 An unknown em sibiny, with a determinative which looks like two plants. T h e tentative translation assumes that it is Hebrew shebtl " p a t h " perhaps "two tracks," not a road, but two traces of chariot wheels across the wilderness—and that the determinative is borrowed from the root which appears in Assyrian shubultu "ear (of g r a i n ) . " 28 This seems to be the only occurrence of the singular marya, for what normally appears in a plural or collective, maryanu, n . 1 5 above. Of course, the writing here may be defective. 29 T h e Karnak variant has a date: ". . . [of the third] season, day 2 7 , " followed by a broken and uncertain context, which seems to apply to the temple of Ptah at Memphis: "His majesty came forth from the House . . . of the Beautiful of Face." Then, "[His majesty] proceeded [to] Memphis, bearing the booty which he had carried off from the country of Retenu. List of the booty: living maryanu: 550; the[ir wi]ves: 240; \in . . . of fine gold: 6,800 deben·, copper: 500,000 deben; . . . total: 2 heads·, horses: 2 1 0 ; and chariots: 3 0 0 . " Thus, the Memphite text's \in'anu, which can only be understood as Kena'ani "Canaanite," has been turned by the Karnak text into some object related to gold—perhaps *\enc(ah "baggage, pack," of Jer. 1 0 : 1 7 . The gold would amount to about 1,700 lb. Troy, the copper to 125,000 lb. Troy.

However, 270 women minstrels seems a very high number, and the translation assumes that these were simply harem women, who would also have entertainment paraphernalia. 31 Sic, 2 , 2 1 4 , although the total by addition comes to 2,255. 32 Probably the queen Ti-'aa or the queen Hat-shepsut II. Karnak variant: "The entire land beheld the victory of his majesty." 33 See n.i above. About 1440 B.C., the present date would fall in the early part of November, an unusual season for an Egyptian campaign in Asia. 34 Of several Apheqs, the one at Ras el-Ain in Palestine seems to fit the apparent itinerary best. 35 On Yehem see p. 235, n.18 above. 39 Of these three names, only Socho can be identified. Karnak variant: " H i s majesty . . . ed the tribe of Khettjen . . . N o w the prince . . . [abandoned] the city for fear of his majesty. His princes (or officials?), his women, his children, and all his [retain]ers as well, were carried off. List of that which his majesty himself captured: . . . , his horses."

His majesty went forth by chariot at dawn, against the town of Iteren, as well as Migdol-yi«." Then his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—prevailed like the prevailing of Sekhmet, like Montu over Thebes. He carried off their princes: 34; m e r u i t 57; living Asiatics: 231; hands: 372; horses: 54; chariots: 54; in addition to all the weapons of warfare, every able-bodied man39 of Retenu, their children, their wives, and all their property. After his majesty saw the very abundant plunder, they were made into living prisoners, and two ditches were made around all of them. Behold, they were filled with fire, and his majesty kept watch over it until daybreak, while his (25) battle-axe was in his right hand, alone, without a single one with him, while the army was far from him, far from hearing the cry of Pharaoh.40 Now after daybreak of a second day, his majesty went forth by chariot at dawn, adorned with the equipment of Montu. The day of the Feast of the Royal Coronation of his majesty:41 Anaharath was plundered.

Possibly to be emended to read: "their serfs." 89 "Every strong of arm," i.e. every adult. 40 This episode was sheer bravura on the part of the pharaoh, of a spectacular nature in order to create a legend of his personal prowess. 41 Which was the 4th month of the first season, day 1 (cf. A. H. Gardiner in JEA, x x x i [ 1 9 4 5 ] , 2 7 ) , or 6 days after the date against n.33 above. 42 Perhaps "the vicinity of 'Akti." In either case, unknown. 43 Here Qeb'asemen. Elsewhere Keb'asemen, which M. Burchardt, Die altkanaanaischen Fremdworte und Eigennamen im Aegyptischen (Leipzig, 1909), 11, 49-50, makes into a possible Geba-shemoneh, "Hill of Eight." 44 Badawi suggests a name like Gargur. 45 cf. the policy of Thut-mose III on Asiatic princes, p. 239 above. 46 Or 2 1 7 or 144. 47 The appearance of the Apiru (cf. pp. 22, 255, 2 6 1 ) in a list of Asiatic captives is unusual. They are listed as the third element in a list, preceded by princes and princes' brothers ( ? ) , followed by three terms having geographic connotation—Shasu, the Bedouin, especially to the south of Palestine; Kharu "Horites," the setded people of Palestine-Syria; and Neges, perhaps "Nukhashshe," the people of northern Syria—and terminated by an expression of attribution, here translated: "the adherents(?) thereof," with a miscarved hr sign, but perhaps to be read: "the families thereof," with the word abet " f a m i l y . " T h e Apiru are notably greater in number than the princes and princes* brothers; they are notably fewer in number than the three regional listees or the retainers (or families). It is quite clear that the Egyptians recognized the Apiru as a distinct entity from other peoples, clearly countable. See also A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica, 1, 1 8 4 · .

Now when the Prince of Naharin, the Prince of Hatti, and the Prince of Shanhar51 heard of the great victory which I had made, each one vied with his fellow in making offering, while they said in their hearts to the father of their fathers, in order to beg peace from his majesty, seeking that there be given to them the breath of life: " W e are under thy sway, for thy palace, O Son of Re: Amen-hotep-the-God-Ruler-of-Heliopolis, ruler of rulers, raging Hon in ... this land forever!"52
B. THE AMADA AND ELEPHANTINE STELAE
A different treatment of Amen-hotep II's achievements emphasizes the nature of his triumphs in Egypt after his return from Asiatic campaigning. This is also on two monuments, both published in Ch. Kuentz, Deux steles d'Amenophis II (Bibliotheque d'Etude, x, Cairo, 1925). The stela in the Temple of Amada in Nubia was published by H. Gauthier, Le temple d'Amada (Les temples immerges de la Nubie, xm, Cairo, 19131926), 19 ff., PI. x. The stela from Elephantine is now divided between Cairo (No. 34019: P. Lacau, Steles du nouvel empire [Catalogue general. . . du Musee du Caire, Cairo, 1909], 38-40, PI. xii) and Vienna (W. Wreszinski, Aegyptische Inschriften aus dem K. K. Hofmuseum in Wien [Leipzig, 1906], No. 141). Translation in Breasted, AR, 11, §§791-97. The line numbers below follow the Amada Stela.

Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica, 1, 209* IT. 52 The end of the inscription has been badly garbled by the restoration of the 19th dynasty. Of course, the historicity of the frightened submissiveness of distant and independent rulers is out of the question, and represents a literary device for the climax of a swashbuckling account. 58 See n.i above. Around 1440 B.C., the present date would have fallen in July. 54 The long titulary of the king and many of the epithets applied to him are omitted in this translation. 55 See the claims made for him in the text describing his athletic accomplishments, p. 244 above. 56 "Rulers of foreign countries" here seems to be distinct from the princes of Syria-Palestine, and it was the term from which the designation "Hyksos" arose; cf. pp. 20, n.16; 229, n.9 above. 57 "Was upon his water," which normally means: "was subject to him."

Then six men of these enemies were hanged on the face of the wall of Thebes, and the hands as well.60 Then the other foe was taken upstream to the land of Nubia and hanged to the wall of Napata,61 to show his majesty's victories forever and ever in all lands and all countries of the Negro land; inasmuch as he had carried off the southerners and bowed down the northerners, the (very) ends of the (20) entire earth upon which Re shines, (so that) he might set his frontier where he wishes without being opposed, according to the decree of his father R e . . . .
A Syrian Captive Colony
in Thebes
Little is known of the activities of Thut-mose IV (about 14211413 B.C.) in Asia. The energies of Thut-mose III and of Amenhotep II may have left him litde need for military prowess. Some of the Asiatic regions which he claimed to have conquered will be found in the lists on pp. 242-43 above. He continued his predecessors' practice of introducing foreign captives into the Egyptian temple estates, as is evidenced by a brief text on a stela found in his mortuary temple in western Thebes. The inscription was published by W. M. F. Petrie, Six Temples at Thebes (London, 1896), PI. 1, No. 7, and translated by Breasted, AR, n, §821. For the "Dream Stela" of Thut-mose IV, see p. 449 below.

The first instance is from the Theban tomb (No. 100) of Rekh-mi-Re, vizier under Thut-mose III (about 1490-1436 B.C.). In two registers Asiatics are depicted bringing their characteristic goods to the vizier. It is definitively published by N. de G. Davies, The Tomb of Rekh-mi-Re at Thebes (Publications of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Egyptian Expedition, xi, New York, 1943), 1, 27-30; 11, Pis. xxi-xxiu. Details of the scenes are shown in color by Davies, Paintings from the Tomb of Rekh-miRe at Thebes (Publications of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Egyptian Expedition, x, New York, 1935), Pis.

Men-kheper-Re-seneb was High Priest of Amon under Thutmose III. The scenes and texts in his Theban tomb (No. 86) give us a suggestion of the importance of the riches of Asia to the temple of the imperial god Amon. See N. and N. de G. Davies, The Tombs of Men\heperrasonb, Amenmose, and Another {Theban Tomb Series, v, London, 1933), Pis. iv, vn. Texts in K. Sethe, opxit., 929-30. Details in color in N. M. Davies and A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Paintings (Chicago, 1936), 1, Pis. xxi-xxiv. In the scenes, an individual labeled "the Prince of Keftiu"1 prostrates himself, "the Prince of Hatti" kneels in adoration, "the Prince of Tunip"2 presents his infant son, and "the Prince of Kadesh" offers an elaborate vessel. A procession of Asiatics voices their submission in a broken text, of which the final words are legible: "The fear of thee is in all lands. Thou hast annihilated the lands of Mitanni; thou hast laid waste their towns, and their princes are in caves." The general legend for this scene runs:

Two generations later, under Thut-mose IV (about 14211413 B.C.), the form of expression remains the same, as in the Theban tomb (No. 74) of Tjaneni, an officer of the Egyptian army.

The Amarna Revolution drastically altered the direction of empire, but the modes of expression remained much the sameas, for example, in the Memphite tomb of Hor-em-heb, pp. 250251 below.

The Egyptians and the Gods
of Asia*
In earlier history the Egyptians had identified foreign gods with their own deities, so that the goddess of Byblos was a HatHor to them and various Asiatic gods were Seth to them.1 This

1 F o r example, such was still the case in the Egyptian-Hittite treaty at
process of extending their own into other countries continued under the Empire. Ramses III built a temple of Amon in Asia,2 and Ptah had a sanctuary at Ashkelon.4 There were also two cosmopolitan forces at work: a worship of Asiatic gods as such at their shrines in Asia and a domestication of Asiatic gods in Egypt. The first of these processes began at least as early as the time of Thut-mose III (15th century B.C.). A stela found at Beisan in Palestine shows the Egyptian architect Amen-em-Opet and his son worshiping the local god Mekal. "Mekal, the god of BethShan," is depicted as unmistakably Asiatic in features and dress, with a pointed beard and a conical headdress with horns and streamers. Amen-em-Opet addresses a perfecdy normal Egyptian mortuary prayer to this god.4 Beisan also yielded a stela of the Ramses III level (12th century B.C.), on "which an Egyptian is shown worshiping the goddess "Anath, Lady of Heaven, Mistress of All the Gods."5 Near Sheikh Sa'ad, east of the Sea of Galilee, a badly worn stela was found depicting Ramses II making offering to a deity with an elaborate headdress. The name of this deity, with some uncertainty, might be read as Adon-Zaphon, "Lord of the North."9 From about the same period (13th century B.C.) comes a stela found at Ugarit (Ras Shamra) on the north Phoenician coast. Here the "Royal Scribe and Chief Steward of the Palace Memi" addresses his mortuary prayer to "Baal-Zaphon, the great god," a being with the Asiatic conical cap with streamers.7 From the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty on (14th century B.C.), there is an abundance of evidence on Asiatic gods worshiped in Egypt. The most frequendy mentioned deity was Baal.8 As the god of the heavens, the mountain tops, and of thunder—the Semitic Baal-Shamaim—he was the counterpart of the Egyptian god Seth, and his name was used in figures of speech relating to the pharaoh in batde:
His battle cry is like (that of) Baal in the heavens.9
In this terrorizing capacity the texts equate him with the Egyptian war-gods Montu and Seth.10 He was used in magical texts to frighten away evil forces:
Baal smites thee with the cedar tree which is in his hand.11
However, his role might be beneficent, as when a woman musician wrote from Memphis, appealing to various gods on behalf of her correspondent:
. . . to the Ennead which is in the House of Ptah, to
the time of Ramses II (13th century); cf. pp. 200-201 above: Seth of Hatti, equated to the Storm-god of the land of Hatti; Seth of various Hittite towns, equated to the Storm-gods of those towns; Re, lord of the sky, equated to the Hittite Sun-god. Cf. p. 2 3 1 , n.9. I pp. 260-261.

Baalat, to Qedesh, to Meni, (to) Baali-Zaphon, to Sopdu,..
Baal had his own priesthood in Egypt from the late Eighteenth Dynasty on.13 Toward the end of the Empire, the presence in Egypt of such a personal name as Baal-khepeshef, "Baal-is(Upon)-His-Sword,"14 corresponding to good Egyptian names like Amon-her-khepeshef, Montu-her-khepeshef, and Seth-herkhepeshef, shows the domestication of this immigrant god from Asia. Also popular in Egypt were the Semitic goddesses Anath and Astarte (Ishtar).15 They served as war-goddesses, with a particular interest in horses and chariots. As early as Thut-mose IV (late 15th century), the pharaoh was described as "mighty in the chariot like Astarte."16 In a poem in praise of the king's war chariot (13th century), a dual part of the chariot is likened to Anath and Astarte.17 It was said of Ramses III (12th century):
Montu and Seth are with him in every fray; Anath and Astarte are a shield to him.18
By the Eighteenth Dynasty, Astarte had become a goddess of healing in Egypt, in the name of "Astar of Syria."19 Anath, Astarte, and Qedesh each bore the Egyptian tide, "Lady of Heaven," generally equivalent to the Hebrew Mele\eth Hashshamaim, "Queen of the Heavens." Like Baal, Astarte had her own priesthood in Egypt.20 The egyptianization of Anath and

T h e Ennead of gods in Memphis and Sopdu are good Egyptian, although the latter, as a god of the east, integrates with the Asiatic deities here. Baalat is, of course, the female counterpart of Baal. Baali-Zaphon, "the Baals of the North," may not be a true plural, but a plural of majesty, cf. the Baal-Zaphon, which Exodus 1 4 : 2 uses as a place-name on the Asiatic frontier of Egypt. The goddess Qedesh will be discussed below. The reading "Meni" is quite uncertain and attempts to relate the name to a god "Fortune" in Isaiah 6 5 : 1 1 . The Egyptian might equally be read " I n i .

Astarte is indicated by the compounding of their names into personal names of normal formation.21 Something has already been said about the goddess Qedesh, "the Holy," and about the god Rashap (cr Resheph or Reshpu).22 These two, together with the Egyptian god Min, are associated on a stela in Vienna, where the goddess Qedesh stands on the back of a lion.23 So also, on a stela in the British Museum, a goddess Kenet stands on the back of a lion, flanked by Min and by "Rashap, the great god, lord of heaven, and ruler of the Ennead."24 On a stela in Turin are associated "Qedesh, Lady of Heaven, Mistress of All the gods, the Eye of Re, without her peer," and "Rashap, the great god, lord of heaven, ruler of the Ennead, and lord of eternity."25 A stela in Aberdeen shows the worship of "Rashap-Shulman."29 Rashap, like Baal, was a wargod and thunder-god. It was said of Ramses Ill's army:
The chariot-warriors are as mighty as Rashaps.27
Finally, as a forceful and exotic deity, Rashap was used in magical texts, as in this formula against some ailment:
with the poisons of the Upper God and Neker, his wife; the poisons of Rashap and Item, his wife.28
Texts from the T o m b of General Hor-em-heb
History may reach a point where the repetition of old and successful formulae is more important than the recording of contemporary events. The historian often cannot be sure whether he is dealing with truthful records or with stereotyped claims of accomplishment. The following extracts constitute a case in point. Under the Amarna Revolution, Egypt lost the greater part of her Asiatic Empire. A commander of the Egyptian armies at that time was the Hor-em-heb who later became pharaoh (reigning about 1349-1319 B.C.). While still an official, he erected a tomb at Sakkarah, of which the remains are now scattered in three continents. The claims of foreign conquest and tribute may enlarge a limited reality or may be the protestations which covered failure. The texts of (a) below are in the British Museum, the Cairo Museum, and the Louvre; of (b) in a private collection in Alexandria; of (c) in the Civic Museum in Bologna; of (d) in the Rijksmuseum at Leyden; and of (e) in the Vienna Museum.

Hor-em-heb was sent by an unnamed pharaoh to bring tribute from countries to the south of Egypt, for the occasion of the formal presentation of tribute of Africa and Asia.

They mustered [every] foreign country [into a confederacy] unknown since Re. Their battle cry in their hearts was as one. (But) thy name is flaming [against them, and they become] subject to thee.

1 The only one of the Amarna pharaohs who has left us visible claim to foreign conquest was Tut-ankh-Amon, whose decorated box (N. M. Davies and A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Paintings [Chicago, 1 9 3 6 ] , n, PL LXXVIII) shows a battle scene of the pharaoh decimating the Asiatic enemy, with the legend: ' T h e good god, son of Amon, hero without his peer, possessor of a strong arm, crushing hundred-thousands and making them prostrate." One may hold some scepticism about the historicity of any such encounter. 2 In view of the following clause and the probable balanced statement of south and north, this unreadable name was probably that of a country to the south of Egypt—perhaps Nepau, which appears in a long list of African regions conquered by Thut-mose III.

Tut-ankh-Amon's Restoration
after the Amarna Revolution
The Amarna movement barely survived the reign of Akh-enAton. His son-in-law Tut-ankh-Amon was forced to make his peace with the older priesthoods and civil officials and return to Thebes. On a stela erected in the Temple of Amon at Karnak, he tells of his pious acts of restoration after the heresy. The stela was later usurped by Hor-em-heb (about 1349-1319 B.C.), who inserted his name in place of the name of Tut-ankh-Amon (about 1361-1352 B.C.), since the latter had been stained by relation to the heresy. The stela was found by G. Legrain at Karnak, and is now 34183 in the Cairo Museum. It was published by Legrain in Recueil de travaux . .. , xxix (1907), 162-73, and by P. Lacau, Steles du nouvel empire (Catalogue general . . . du Musee du Caire; Cairo, 1909), 224 ff., PI. LXX, with the fragment of a duplicate inscription, Cairo 34184, on p. 230 f. There is a translation and commentary by J. Bennett in JEA, xxv (1939), 8-15. The year date at the beginning of the inscription is unfortunately lost.

The land was topsy-turvy,2 and the gods turned their backs upon this land. If [the army was] sent to Djahi to extend the frontiers of Egypt, no success of theirs came at all. If one prayed to a god to seek counsel from him, he would never come [at all]. If one made supplication to a goddess similarly, she would never come at all.
3 The pharaoh. •Revised since the first edition of this volume, following the demonstration by A. H. Gardiner in JEA, xxxix ( 1 9 5 3 ) , 6-9, that the inscription was actually written retrograde on the wall. Thus it does not deal with the relocation of transplanted peoples.
1 Although the entire context was inevitably framed with reference to the restoration after the Amarna heresy, these same expressions were used about the accession of any pharaoh, who had a responsibility to restore order (mefat "truth, justice") as order had been given by the gods. 2 A compound expression, seni-meni "was passed-by-and-sick."

Their hearts were hurt in their bodies, (10) (so that) they did damage to that which had been made. Now after days had passed by this,3 [his majesty] appeared [upon] the throne of his father. He ruled the regions of Horus; the Black Land and the Red Land4 were under his authority, and every land was bowing down to the glory of him. Now when his majesty was in his palace which is in the House of Aa-kheper-ka-Re,5 like Re in the heavens, then his majesty was conducting the affairs of this land and the daily needs of the T w o Banks. So his majesty deliberated plans with his heart, searching for any beneficial deed, seeking out acts of service for his father Amon, and fashioning his august image of genuine fine gold. He surpassed what had been done previously. He fashioned his father Amon upon thirteen carrying-poles, his holy image being of fine gold, lapis lazuli, [turquoise], and every august costly stone, whereas the majesty of this august god had formerly been upon eleven carrying-poles. He fashioned Ptah, South-of-HisWall, Lord of Life of the T w o Lands, his august image being of fine gold, [upon] eleven [carrying-poles], his holy image being of fine gold, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and every august costly stone, whereas the majesty of (15) this august god had formerly been on [ * - { - ] 3 carrying-poles.® Then his majesty made monuments for the gods, [fashioning] their cult-statues of genuine fine gold from the highlands, building their sanctuaries anew as monuments for the ages of eternity, established with possessions forever, setting for them divine offerings as a regular daily observance, and provisioning their foodofferings upon earth. He surpassed what had been previously, [he] went beyond what had [been done] since the time of the ancestors. He has inducted priests and prophets from the children of the nobles of their towns, (each) the son of a known man, whose (own) name is known. He has increased their [property] in gold, silver, bronze, and copper, without limit in [any respect].7 He has filled their workhouses with male and female slaves, the product of his majesty's capturing [in every foreign country]. All the [property] of the temples has been doubled, tripled, and quadrupled in silver, [gold], lapis lazuli, turquoise, every (kind of) august costly stone, royal linen, white linen, fine linen, olive oil, gum, fat, (20) . . . incense, benzoin, and myrrh, without limit to any good thing. His majesty—life, prosperity, health!has built their barques upon the river of new cedar from

From another inscription, this estate seems to have been at Memphis, a religious center which has unusual prominence in a text located at Karnak. 6 The portable statues of Amon and Ptah seem to have had an "august image" (tit shepset) and also a "holy image" (tit djesret), the distinction between which is not clear. These were carried by priests, the number of carrying-poles being a factor in the number of priests and thus in the honor paid to the god.

The Era of the City of Tanis
About the year 1330 B.C., when Hor-em-heb was pharaoh, a vizier of Egypt named Seti came to the city Tanis in the Delta to celebrate a four hundredth anniversary. This anniversary took the form of the worship of the Egyptian god Seth, who is represented in the scene carved on the stela as an Asiatic deity in a distinctively Asiatic dress. Somewhere close to four hundred years before 1330 B.C., the Hyksos had begun their rule in Egypt, and the Hyksos capital Avaris was probably the later Tanis and the later city Ramses, while the god of the Hyksos was equated by the Egyptians with Seth.1 The celebration therefore commemorated the four hundredth year of the rule of Seth as a king, and apparendy also the four hundredth year since the founding of Tanis.2 It was, of course, out of the question that the Egyptians should mention the hated Hyksos in such a commemoration, but Seth held a high position under the Ninteenth Dynasty, with two pharaohs named Seti, "Seth's Man."
Later the father of this vizier Seti became the pharaoh Ramses I and founded a dynastic line. Seti himself became the pharaoh Seti I. When his son Ramses II enlarged the city Tanis to be his capital city Ramses,3 he set up a stela to justify Tanis' claim to rule, on the ground that the god Seth had ruled there for four hundred years.
8 Negau lay in or near the Lebanon, a region of coniferous woods: see Helck, opxit., 277. 9 The use of the first person singular in this sentence suggests that it was a quotation from a royal decree for the immunity of temples from taxes. The expenses of the slaves and musicians whom the pharaoh gave to the temples were charged against the royal estate and not against the temples. 10 Since this is the home of the Ennead, it is probably the Temple of Heliopolis. 11 Pictorially a god held the hieroglyph of life to the nose of the king; or he might hold strings of "year" or "jubilee" hieroglyphs for the king's long life. 12 Amon made Tut-ankh-Amon the divine king in order that Amon might be advanced.
1 cf. p. 231, n.9. 2 Numbers ( 1 3 : 2 2 ) , carries the tradition that Tanis (Zoan) and Hebron in Palestine were founded at approximately the same time. 8 For the argument that Tanis, the Hyksos capital Avaris, and the city Ramses were one and the same, see A. H. Gardiner in JEA, x i x ( 1 9 3 3 ) , 122-28.

The "Stela of the Year 400" was found at Tanis. See the latest publication by P. Montet in Kemi, iv (1933), 191-215. The significance of the stela was stated by K. Sethe in ZAeS, LXV (1930), 85-89. There is a translation in Breasted, AR, 111, §§538-42. The scene above the inscription designates the Asiatic-garbed Seth as "Seth of Ramses," thus locating him in the residence city of that name.

A Campaign of Seti I
in Northern Palestine
Internally and externally the Amarna Revolution had dealt a serious blow to Egyptian empire. Domestic reorganization was the first need. Then, when Seti I (about 1318-1301 B.C.) became pharaoh, he returned to campaigning in Asia. This stela from Palestinian soil gives a brief statement of his energy in meeting an attempted coalition of Asiatic princes.

Year 1, 3rd month of the third season, day io.1 Live the Horus: Mighty Bull, Appearing in Thebes, Making the Two Lands to Live; the Two Goddesses: Repeating Births, Mighty of Arm, Repelling the Nine Bows; the Horus of Gold: Repeating Appearances, Mighty of Bows in All Lands; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands: Men-maat-Re [Ir]-enRe; the Son of Re, Lord of Diadems: Seti Mer-ne-Ptah, beloved of Re-Har-akhti, the great god. The good god, potent with his arm, heroic and valiant like Montu, rich in captives, (5) knowing (how to) place his hand, alert wherever he is; speaking with his mouth, acting with his hands, valiant leader of his army, valiant warrior in the very heart of the fray, a Bastet2 terrible in combat, penetrating into a mass of Asiatics and making them prostrate, crushing the princes of Retenu, reaching the (very) ends of (10) him who transgresses against his way. He causes to retreat the princes of Syria,® all the boastfulness of whose mouth was (so) great. Every foreign country of the ends of the earth, their princes say: "Where shall we go?" They spend the night giving testimony in his name, saying: "Behold it, behold it!" in their hearts. It is the strength of his father Amon that decreed to him valor and victory.
On this day4 one came to speak to his majesty, as follows: (15) "The wretched foe who is in the town of Hamath5 is gathering to himself many people, while he is seizing the town of Beth-Shan. Then there will be an alliance with them of Pahel. He does not permit the Prince of Rehob to go outside."6 Thereupon his majesty sent the first army of Amon, (named) "Mighty of Bows," to the town of Hamath, the first army of the (20) Re, (named) "Plentiful of Valor," to the town of Beth-Shan, and the first army of Seth, (named) "Strong of Bows," to the town of Yanoam.7 When the space of a day had passed, they were overthrown to the glory of his majesty, the King

This may have been a prince from the north; note that Seti sends one army division north to Yanoam. 9 Ancient Beth-Shan is modern Tell el-Husn, just northwest of modern Beisan. Hamath is almost certainly Tell el-Hammeh, about 10 mi. south of Beisan. Pahel or Pella is Khirbet Fahil, about 7 mi. southeast of Beisan and across the Jordan. Rehob is probably Tell es-§arem, about 3 mi. south of Beisan. These cities all seem to have lain within a small range. It would seem that Hamath and Pahel were acting against Beth-Shan and Rehob. 7 "First a r m y " has something of the sense of corps d'ilite. As in Ramses II's campaign against Kadesh, each division of the Egyptian army marched under die aegis of a god, whose image led the way. cf. pp. 255-56. Seti I's dispositions were rapid and effective. One problem here is the reason for sending a unit against Yanoam, which was apparendy considerably north of the center of disaffection. Yanoam may be modern Tell en-Na'ameh, north of Lake Huleh and thus nearly 50 mi. north of Beisan. Perhaps the real opposition to Egypt lay to the north, in the territory dominated by the Hittites. Perhaps the leader of this coalition came from the north; cf. n.5 above. By throwing a road-block against reinforcements from the north, Seti I would be able to deal with a localized rebellion around Beth-Shan, without outside interference.

Campaigns of Seti I in Asia
On the north exterior wall of the great hypostyle hall at Karnak Seti I (about 1318-1301 B.C.) has left scenes of his military activity with at least four objectives: against the ShasuBedouin of Sinai and southern Palestine, against the mountain region of Palestine-Syria, against the Hittites in central and northern Syria, and against the Libyans. Extracts from this material will illustrate the problem which this pharaoh faced in attempting to reconstitute the Egyptian Empire. Bibliography of the publications and translations of the texts will be found in Breasted, AR, 111, §§80-156, and bibliography also in B. Porter and R. L. B. Moss, Topographical Bibliography ...//. Theban Temples (Oxford, 1929), 19-23. A convenient transcription of the texts, but without improvement over the earlier copyists, will be found in C. E. Sander-Hansen, Historische Inschriften der /9.

This scene gives Seti's return from a campaign, but the text states the reasons for his activity. The resdessness in Palestine was an aftermath of the disturbances in the Amarna period.
Year 1 of the Renaissance,1 and of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands: Men-maatRe, given life. Then one came to say to his majesty: "The foe belonging to the Shasu are plotting (5) rebellion. Their tribal chiefs are gathered in one place, waiting on the mountain ranges of Kharu.2 They have taken to clamoring and quarreling, one of them killing his fellow. They have no regard for the laws of the palace." The heart of his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—was glad at it. (10) Now as for the good god, he exults at undertaking combat; he delights at an attack on him; his heart is satisfied at the sight of blood. He cuts off the heads of the perverse of heart. He loves ( 1 5 ) an instant of trampling more than a day of jubilation. His majesty kills them all at one time, and leaves no heirs among them. He who is spared by his hand is a living prisoner, carried off to Egypt.

Three scenes show the pharaoh on the march and list the stations on the military road through Sinai, running close to the sea between the Egyptian frontier at Sile (near modern Kantarah) and Raphia in Palestine. This was the main avenue of intercourse between Egypt and Palestine. The route has been studied by A. H. Gardiner in JEA, vi (1920), 99-116, in relation to the similar listing in the satirical letter of p. 478 below.
1 "Repeating Births." Seti I's reign inaugurated a new era; sec ZAeS, LXVI ( 1 9 3 1 ) , 4. 2 Probably, as in the Beisan stela of this same year (pp. 253-54 above), the mountains of northern Palestine.
An interesting touch of evidence on the international forces playing upon the imperial religion of the time is the fact that the pharaoh's team of horses has an alternative name: "The great team of his majesty (named) 'Amon Decrees to Him the Valor,' which is (also) called 'Anath is Content.' "*
C
Somewhere in Palestine Seti I attacked a fortified place, "the town of the Canaan," which we cannot locate. As the accompanying text indicates, this was on the same expedition as that of the scenes just mentioned.
Year 1 of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Menmaat-Re. The desolation which the mighty arm of Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health!—made among the foe belonging to the Shasu from the fortress of Sile to the Canaan. His majesty [pre]vailed over them like a fierce lion. They were made into corpses throughout their valleys, stretched out in their (own) blood, like that which has never been.
Another scene shows the pharaoh capturing a town surrounded by a forest, "the town of Yanoam." This may have been the same thrust as that mentioned in the Beisan stela.4 A third scene depicts the Asiatics cutting down trees for the pharaoh, at "the town of Qeder in the land of Henem," which cannot be located.5 However, the local rulers are "the great princes of Lebanon," and the descriptive legend runs:
. . . Lebanon. Cutting down [cedar for] the great barque upon the river, "[Amon]-U[ser-h]et,"6 as well as for the great flagpoles of A m o n . . .

The texts of the scenes following Seti's triumphal return to Egypt link the campaign against the Shasu-Bedouin with the mountain area of Syria-Palestine, called "Upper Retenu."
The return [of] his majesty from Upper Retenu, having extended the frontiers of Egypt. The plunder which his majesty carried off from these Shasu, whom his majesty himself captured in the year 1 of the Renaissance.

Other scenes show Seti I engaged with the Hittites in Syria. He is shown attacking a mountainous setdement, "the town of Kadesh." That this was Kadesh on the Orontes seems certain from the fact that the fragment of a monumental stela of this pharaoh was found on that site.7 The legend for the scene at Karnak runs:
The going up which Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health!—made to desolate the land of Kadesh and the land of Amurru*
Either on this expedition or on a subsequent campaign, the pharaoh came into military competition with the powerful state of Hatti. He is shown in battle, with the legend:

The basalt stela of Ramses II, now in the University Museum in Philadelphia, is thoroughly conventional.

The Asiatic Campaigning of
Ramses II
By length of years and sheer self-assertiveness Ramses II (about 1301-1234 B.C.) left his name scrawled across Egyptian history out of all proportion to his personal achievement. In physical content his texts bulk large, but they lack historical relevance or clear applicability to the Old Testament.
A. THE FIRST TWO CAMPAIGNS
At the mouth of the Dog River (Nahr el-Kelb) between Beirut and Byblos, Ramses II left three nearly illegible stelae of triumph, one of which bears the date, "Year 4," and testifies to his consolidation of territory north to that point by that date.1 In the following year the pharaoh engaged upon the exploit of his life, the battle against the Hittite king Muwatallis at Kadesh on the Orontes. No other text occupies so much wall space in Egypt and Nubia. However, it is clear that Ramses did not win a victory, but succeeded only in extricating himself from a tight spot by his personal valor. The full statement of this campaign is of litde immediate concern here, as the action took place north in Syria and the Hittite confederation was almost completely northern. We give here only those extracts which relate to his crossing Palestine and southern Syria on his way to Kadesh. The texts have been best gathered in Ch. Kuentz, La bataille de Qadesch (Memoires pub. par les membres de l'lnstitut Franqais d'Archeologie Orientale, LV, Cairo, 1928), to which the most recent addition is an extract in Papyrus Beatty in (Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Third Series. Chester Beatty Gift, ed. by A. H. Gardiner [London, 1935], 1, 23-24; 11, Pis. 9-10). The texts appear also in Selim Hassan, Le poeme dit de Pentauor et le rapport officiel sur la bataille de Qadesh (Cairo, 1929). There are translations in Breasted, AR, in, §§298-351, and by J. A . Wilson in AJSL, XLIII (1927), 266-87. The poem is also translated by Erman, LAE, 260-70.
The poem on the battle deals briefly with the departure from Egypt, the organization of the Egyptian army, and the approach to Kadesh (Kuentz, opxit., 220-25, 230-33).
Now then, his majesty had prepared (8) his infantry, his chariotry, and the Sherden2 of his majesty's capturing, whom he had carried off by the victories of his arm, equipped with all their weapons, to whom the orders of combat had been given. His majesty journeyed northward, his infantry and chariotry with him. He began to march on the good way in the year 5, 2nd month of the third season, day 9, (when) his majesty passed the fortress of Sile.3 [He] was mighty like Montu4 when he goes forth, (so that) every foreign country was trembling before him, their chiefs were presenting their tribute, and all the rebels were coming, bowing down through fear of the glory of his majesty. His infantry went on the narrow passes as if on the highways of Egypt. Now after days had passed after this, then his majesty was in Ramses Meri-Amon, the town which is

in the Valley of the Cedar.5 His majesty proceeded northward. After his majesty reached the mountain range of Kadesh, then his majesty went forward like his father Montu, Lord of Thebes, and he crossed ( 1 2 ) the ford of the Orontes, with the first division of Amon (named) "He Gives Victory to User-maat-Re Setep-enRe."9 His majesty reached the town of Kadesh 7 Now the wretched foe belonging to Hatti, with the numerous foreign countries which were with him, was waiting hidden and ready on the northeast of the town of Kadesh, while his majesty was alone by himself ( 1 7 ) with his retinue. The division of Amon was on the march behind him; the division of Re was crossing the ford in a district south of the town of Shabtuna, at the disstance of one iter from the place where his majesty was;8 the division of Ptah was on the south of the town of Arnaim; and the division of Seth was marching on the road. His majesty had formed the first ranks of battle of all the leaders of his army, while they were (still) on the shore in the land of Amurru.. . .9
The briefer account of the battle, called the Record, adds only a few details to the account of the march toward Kadesh (Kuentz, opxit., 328-30).
Year 5, 3rd month of the third season, day 9, under the majesty of (Ramses II).10 When his majesty was in Djahi on his second victorious campaign, the goodly awakening in life, prosperity, and health was at the tent of his majesty on the mountain range south of Kadesh. After this, at the time of dawn, his majesty appeared like the rising of Re, and he took the adornments of his father Montu. The lord proceeded northward, and his majesty arrived at a vicinity south of the town of Shabtuna.11...
The only other detail from the Batde of Kadesh which need be noted here comes from a legend attached to a scene in which a military detachment of Egyptians is shown coming to the rescue of the hard-pressed pharaoh. It seems that this was a separate unit from the four army divisions named above and came by a separate route, arriving in the nick of time for the pharaoh. Kuentz, opxit., 366.
The arrival of the Nearin-troops of Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health!—from the land of Amurru.12. ..
5 An Asiatic town named after Ramses, presumably in the Lebanon. For the "Valley of the Cedar," see also the Story of the T w o Brothers, p. 25. 6 For the naming of the units of the army after gods, each one of whom extended his special sanction to that unit, cf. the Beisan Stela of Seti I, p. 253. 7 The omitted context lists the northern confederation which the Hittite king had gathered. 8 Ramses encamped west of the city of Kadesh. An iter may have been about 2 kilometers at this time* 9 "The shore in the land of Amurru" must have been the Phoenician coast. The omitted continuation of the text then details the battle, beginning with the charge of the concealed Hittite chariotry. 10 lust one month after the date of n.3 above, Ramses had marched from the Egyptian frontier to the highland south of Kadesh. 11 The omitted continuation tells how the Hittite king employed Bedouin agents to lull Ramses II into a false security. 12Nearin is a Semitic word for " b o y s " or "young men." cf. pp. 476, 478 below. However, these troops are shown as Egyptian. The statement that they arrived from "the land of Amurru" must mean that they came by a different route from the rest of the army. One might assume that they were sent up the Phoenician coast to secure communications by water, and then cut inland to join the rest of the army. See A. H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica, 1, 1 7 1 * , 1 8 8 * f.
B. LATER CAMPAIGNING
The campaigns of Ramses II's subsequent years cannot be arranged in historical sequence and ran from southern Palestine to northern Syria. This is true for the activities of his eighth year, as indicated by the legends attached to four of a number of Asiatic strongholds, shown on the back of the first pylon of the Ramesseum at Thebes. These were published by W. M. Müller, Egyptological Researches (Washington, 1906-), 11, Pis. 100-03; W. Wreszinski, Atlas zur altägyptischen Kulturgeschichte, 11 (Leipzig, 1935-), 90-91. Translations in Breasted, AR, HI, §§356-62.
The town which his majesty desolated in the year 8, Merom.13 The town which his majesty desolated in the year 8, Salem.13 The town which his majesty desolated on the mountain of Beth-Anath, Kerep. The town which his majesty desolated in the land of Amurru, Deper.
Here Beth-Anath is probably in Palestine, but Deper (not Tabor!) is to be located in north Syria, in the general region of Tunip. In one of these campaigns Ramses II took action against Ashkelon in southern Palestine. The scene showing the storming of this town is carved in the Temple of Karnak, was published by Wreszinski, opxit., 58, and was translated by Breasted, AR, §§353-55·
The wretched town which his majesty took when it was wicked, Ashkelon. It says: "Happy is he who acts in fidelity to thee, (but) woe (to) him who transgresses thy frontier! Leave over a heritage, so that we may relate thy strength to every ignorant foreign country!"
The Egyptians related all this disturbance to the machinations of the Hittites, even down into Palestine. A scene in Karnak (Müller, opxit., Pis. 37-38; Wreszinski, op.cit., 55a) shows an attack upon the "town which his majesty desolated, Acre," and has a broken text in which one may read the words: "when the princes of Kadesh see him, the [terror ] of him is in their hearts." The Hittite confederation of the Batde of Kadesh was still considered the main foe of Ramses II. Of the same general attitude are the references to the excursions into the region of Tunip and Deper in north Syria, as shown in scenes in the Temple of Luxor and the Ramesseum (Müller, opxit., Pis. 44-45; Wreszinski, opxit., 77-80; 107-09; Breasted, opxit., §§364-66). There the claim of Ramses II that he fought "the fallen ones of Hatti" shows this larger resdessness, covering all of the empire which he claimed in Asia.
C. PEACE BETWEEN EGYPT AND HATTI
Ultimately, both the Egyptians and the Hittites found the war expensive of energies which had to be saved against the encroachments of the Peoples of the Sea. In the 21st year of Ramses II (perhaps 1280 B.C.), a treaty was concluded between Egypt and Hatti, providing for an offensive and defensive alliance; see pp. 199-201. By Ramses II's 34th year (perhaps 1267 B.C.), the alliance between Egypt and Hatti was given visible expression through a royal marriage between the pharaoh and the eldest daughter of the Hittite king. This was not the first international marriage, as the pharaohs preceding the Amarna period had taken royal
13 The pictured determinative of the name Merom is a man with arms raised high in the air, corresponding to the meaning of "height" for the word Merom. The pictured determinative of the name Salem shows a man with arms raised in greeting or salutation, corresponding to the meaning of "Peace!" for this word.

wives from the Mitannian princesses. Egyptian texts treated such a marriage as a surrender of the Hittites, on the theme that the princess was the chief element of "tribute" sent to Egypt, after Hatti had been defeated by the pharaoh. The "Marriage Stela" is a document which mingles bombast with genuine relief at a successful peace after years of fighting. The stelae at Karnak, Elephantine, and Abu Simbel are presented, with translation, by Ch. Kuentz in ASAE, xxv (1925), 181-238. A recendy discovered version at Amarah in the Sudan is still unpublished ( J E A , xxiv [1938], 155). An abbreviated version of the text from Karnak, published by G. Lefebvre in ASAE, xxv (1925), 34-45, aids in giving the end of the text. The earlier treatment of the text is given in Breasted, AR, 111, §§41524.
. .. Then the ( 2 1 ) great princes of every land heard of the mysterious, qualities of his majesty. Then they were dismayed and afraid, and the terror of his majesty was in their hearts, while they lauded his glory and gave praise to his beautiful face, . . . [making offer]ing to him with their children, namely the great lords of Retenu and of strange countries—no matter which14—in order to appease the heart of the Bull and to beg peace from him. *Ramses II.15 They despoiled themselves of their own goods, being charged with their annual dues, with their children at the head of their tribute, in praise and homage to his [name]. *Ramses II. So every foreign country was in humility under the feet of this good god, for he made his frontiers (so that) they were held in [checQ—except for that land of Hatti. It did not do the same as these princes. Words spoken by his majesty: " A s my father Re favors me forever as Ruler of the Two Lands, as I rise like the sun disc and shine like Re, as the heaven is firm upon its supports, I will attain the (25) limits of the land of Hatti, and they shall be prostrate under (my)19 feet forever! *Ramses II. I will make them turn back from fighting at the pass and stop the boasting in their land, for I know that my father Seth has made victory to flourish against every land, since he has made my arm mighty to the height of heaven and my strength to the width of earth! *Ramses II." Then his majesty prepared his infantry and his chariotry, and they were launched in the land of Hatti. He despoiled them alone by himself17 . . . entirely, so that he [made] himself a name forever in the midst of it. *Ramses II. They have memory of the victories of his arm. He makes the survivors of his hand curse, for his prowess among them is like a blazing torch. No prince(s) remain upon their thrones, or their brothers [either], *Ramses II.
They fulfilled many years while they were destroyed and . .. from year to year through the prowess of the great living god, *Ramses II. Then the Great Prince of Hatti sent [to] his majesty, magnifying his prowess and extolling..., saying: .. We are charged with [dues],
14 "They are not known," in the sense: they need not be specified. 15 This text uses the two formal names of Ramses II as a mark of punctuation, here abbreviated with an asterisk for the purposes of this translation. 16 The two texts give "thy" and "his." 17 The theme of solita'y victory derives from Ramses' personal achievements at the Battle of Kadesh.
ORICAL TEXTS
and we [carry] them to thy august palace. Behold, we (30) are under thy feet, O victorious king! May we act according to all that thou hast commanded! *Ramses II." So the Great Prince of Hatti sent and appeased his majesty year by year. *Ramses II. (But) he never listened to them. Now after they saw their land in this destroyed state under the great prowess of the Lord of the T w o Lands, *Ramses II, then the Great Prince of Hatti said to his army and his officials: "What is this? Our land is desolated; our lord Seth is angry with us, and the skies do not give water over against u s . 1 8 . . . Let us despoil ourselves of all our goods, with my eldest daughter at the head of them, and let us carry gifts of fealty19 to the good god, so that he may give us peace, that we may live! *Ramses II." Then he caused to be brought [his] eldest daughter, with noble tribute before her: gold, silver, many great ores, horses without limit to them, cattle, goats, and sheep by the ten-thousands, without limit to the products of their [land.] *Ramses II.
[Then one] came to make communication to his majesty, saying: "Behold, even the Great Prince of Hatti! His eldest daughter is being brought, carrying abundant tribute of everything. They cover the [valleys with] their [numbers], the daughter of the Prince of Hatti and the [daughter of the] Great Princess of Hatti among them. They have passed difficult mountains and wicked ravines. *Ramses II. They have reached the frontier of his majesty. Let (35) our [army] and the officials [come] to receive them. *Ramses II." Then his majesty received [great] joy, and the palace was in happiness, when he heard these mysterious matters, which were completely unknown in Egypt.20 So he despatched the army and the officials hastily, in order to make the reception before them. *Ramses II.
Then his majesty took deliberate counsel with his heart, saying: "How will it be with those whom I have sent, going on a mission to Djahi,21 in these days of rain and snow which come in winter?" Then he offered a great oblation to his father Seth, appealing to him about [//] with the words: "Heaven is in thy hands, and earth is under thy feet. What happens is what thou commandest. Mayest thou [delay] to make the rain, the cold wind, and the snow, until the marvels which thou hast assigned to me shall reach me.22 *Ramses II."
Then his father Seth heard all that he had said. So the skies were peaceful, and days of summer fell to [him], while his army went, being gay, their bodies freestriding, their hearts in joy. *Ramses II. So the daughter of the Great Prince of Hatti marched to Egypt, while the infantry, chariotry, and officials of his majesty accompanied her, mingling with the infantry and char

Cf. the claim, p. 4 7 1 , that the pharaoh is able to withhold rain from Hatti. 19 A Semitic word like the Hebrew bera\ah. 20 The Egyptian account insists that the entire initiative was Hittite. 21 T h e area of Phoenicia and its hinterland, down into Palestine. Note that this is claimed above as "the frontier of his majesty." 22 Seth is here in a dual role: the god cf the Hittites and the god of storm; cf. p. 17, n.27.

iotry of Hatti, for they were (40) teher-warriors2* like the troops of *Ramses II and like his chariotry, all the people of the land of Hatti being mingled with those of Egypt. They ate and drank together, being of one heart like brothers, without shunning one another, for peace and brotherhood were between them, after the manner of the god himself, *Ramses II. Then the great princes of every land, when they passed by them, were dismayed, turned back, shrinking, when they saw all the people of Hatti as they [joined] with the army of the king *Ramses II. So one of these princes said to his fellow: "What his majesty has said is true How great are these [things] which we have seen with our own faces! Every foreign country is with [him] as slaves, in one accord with [Egypt]! *Ramses II. That which had been the land of Hatti, behold, it has come to be like Egypt with him. What is the heaven ? It (also) is under his seal, so that it acts according to all that he has wished! *Ramses II." Now after [many days they] reached (the city) Ramses Meri-Amon,... and we celebrated the great marvels of valor and victory in the year 34, 3rd month of the second season.24 *Ramses II. Then they ushered the daughter of the Great Prince of Hatti, who had come marching to Egypt, into the presence of his majesty,25 with very great tribute following her, without limit Then [his] majesty saw that she was fair of face [li\e] a goddess. Now (it was) a great, mysterious, marvellous, and fortunate affair. It was unknown, unheard of from mouth to mouth, not mentioned in the writings of the ancestors . . . *Ramses II. So she was beautiful in the heart of his majesty, and he loved her more than anything, as a good fortune for him through [the command of] his father Ptah-tenen.29 *Ramses II. "Then his majesty caused that her name be made to be: the King's Wife Maat-nefru-Re,28 the daughter of the Great Prince of Hatti and the daughter of the Great Princess of Hatti....
And so it was that, if a man or a woman proceeded on their mission to Djahi, they could reach the land of Hatti without fear around about their hearts, because of the greatness of the victories of his [maj]esty.

The Report of a Frontier Official
In a group of letters which served as models for schoolboys, one communication presents the form in which an official on the eastern frontier of Egypt might report the passage of Asiatic tribes into the better pasturage of the Delta. Papyrus Anastasi VI (British Museum 10245), lines 51-61 ( = iv 11-v 5 ) , of the late Nineteenth Dynasty (end of the 13th century B.C.) and presumably from Memphis. Facsimiled in Select Papyri in the Hieratic Character from the Collections of the British Museum, in (London, 1844), Pis. cxxv-cxxvi. Transcription into hieroglyphic by A. H. Gardiner, Late Egyptian Miscellanies (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, VII, Brussels, 1937), 76-77. Translated by Breasted, AR, HI, §§636-38.*

1 T h e pupil, Inena, addresses his master, Qa-gabu; cf. p. 25 above. 2 The Egyptian word is Shasu, which became Coptic shds "shepherd." 3 The location is the eastern end of the Wadi Tumilat, the "land of Goshen." The Fortress of Mer-ne-Ptah will have been a frontier fortress. Tjeku—or probably Teku—could only with difficulty be Succoth and seems to be a broad designation for the region. * The Semitic word btr\eh is used. 5 Per-Atum, "the House of A turn," is probably biblical Pithom, located by A. H. Gardiner (JEA, xix [ 1 9 3 3 ] , 127) at Tell er-Retabeh, about 22 miles west of modern Ismailiyeh. 9 "The Birth of Seth" was the 3rd intercalary day at the end of the year. Around 1 2 1 5 B.C. this would be after the middle of June. 7 That is, the names of other days.
T h e Pursuit of Runaway Slaves
Among the model letters set for the instruction of schoolboys, there is one reporting the pursuit of two slaves escaping from Egypt into Asia. Papyrus Anastasi V (British Museum 10244), xix 2-xx 6, of the end of the 13th century B.C. and probably from Memphis. Facsimiled in Select Papyri in the Hieratic Character from the Collections of the British Museum, in (London, 1844), Pis. cxin-cxiv. Transcribed into hieroglyphic by A. H. Gardiner, Late-Egyptian Miscellanies (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, VII, Brussels, 1937), 66-67. Translated by Erman, LAE, 198-99, and an extract by A. H. Gardiner in JEA, vi (1920), 109-10*
The Chief of Bowmen of Tjeku,1 Ka-Kem-wer, to the Chief of Bowmen Ani and the Chief of Bowmen Baken-Ptah: In life, prosperity, health! In the favor of Amon-Re, King of the Gods, and of the of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: User-kheperu-Re Setep-en-Re2—life, prosperity, health!—our good lord—life, prosperity, health! I say to (xix 5) the Re-Har-akhti: "Keep Pharaoh—life, prosperity, health!—our good lord—life, prosperity, health!—in health! Let him celebrate millions of jubilees, while we are in his favor daily!"
Another matter, to wit: I was sent forth from the broad-halls of the palace—life, prosperity, health!—in the 3rd month of the third season, day 9,3 at the time of evening, following after these two slaves.4 Now when I reached the enclosure-wall of Tjeku on the 3rd month of the third season, day 10, they told [me] they were saying to the south that they5 had passed by on the 3rd month of the third season, day 10.9 (xx 1) [Now] when [I] reached the fortress,7 they told me that the scouf had come from the desert [saying that] they had passed the walled place north of the Migdol of Seti Mer-ne-Ptah—life, prosperity, health!—Beloved like Seth.9
When my letter reaches you, write to me about all that has happened to [them]. Who found their tracks? Which watch found their tracks ? What people are after them? Write to me about all that has happened to them and how many people you send out after them.10 [May your health] be good!
1 Or Teku. Probably not Succoth. Gardiner (JEA, vi [ 1 9 2 0 ] , 1 0 9 ) locates it at Tell el-Maskhuteh in the Wadi Tumilat. It seems more likely that it is not yet identifiable, and it may be generally equivalent to the Wadi Tumilat. 2 Seti II (about 1 2 2 2 - 1 2 1 2 B . C . ) . 3 About 1220 B.C., this date would fall in the month of May. * For the Egyptian word ba\ as "slave," rather than "servant," cf. JEA, xxvi (1941), 26, n.i; 73-74· 5 The slaves. The two preceding uses of "they" are impersonal 9 Thus on the same day, but, on rumor, further south. 7 Perhaps the frontier fortress of Sile, near modern Kantarah. 8 This word maskarui is probably corrupt and has usually been emended to marui "groom." In the present context it might be emended to a noun based on the Hebrew word shamar "watch, guard." 9 For the location of this Migdol at Tell el-Her in Sinai and about a dozen miles northeast of Sile, see Gardiner in JEA, vi ( 1 9 2 0 ) , 1 0 9 - 1 0 . 10 Since Ani and Bak-en-Ptah seem to be still in pursuit of the slaves, these officers may have been located in Asia.

A Syrian Interregnum
For an unknown number of years between the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties Egypt was in a chaotic state and for a part of the time was under the rule of a Syrian. All that we know of this episode comes from the following text. The Great Papyrus Harris comes from Thebes and dates to the end of the reign of Ramses III (about 1164 B.C.), forming a kind of last will and testament for him. The troubles which he here describes lay between the reign of the last king of the Nineteenth Dynasty (about 1205 B.C.) and the beginning of the reign of Ramses Ill's father, Set-nakht (about 1197 B.C.). Papyrus Harris I (British Museum 10053), lxxv 1-9. Facsimile of the text edited by S. Birch in Facsimile of an Egyptian Hieratic Papyrus of the Reign of Rameses 111, now in the British Museum (London, 1876). Transcribed into hieroglyphic by W. Erichsen, Papyrus Harris I (Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca, v, Brussels, 1933), 91-92. Translated by Breasted, AR, iv, §§397-99.
SAID King User-maat-Re Meri-Amon1—life, prosperity, health!—the great god,2 to the officials and leaders of the land, the infantry, the chariotry, the Sherden,3 the many bowmen, and all the souls of Egypt:
Hear ye, that I may make you aware of my benefactions which I accomplished while I was king of the people. The land of Egypt had been cast aside, with every man being his (own standard of) right. They had no chief spokesman for many years previously up to other times. The land of Egypt was officials and mayors,4 one slaying his fellow, both exalted and lowly. Other times came afterwards in the empty years,5 and . . . ,6 a Syrian (5) with them, made himself prince. He set the entire land as tributary before him. One joined his companion that their property might be plundered. They treated the gods like the people, and no offerings were presented in the temples.
But when the gods reversed themselves to show mercy and to set the land right as was its normal state, they established their son, who had come forth from their body, to be Ruler—life, prosperity, health!—of every land, upon their great throne: User-kha-Re Setep-en-Re Meri-Amon—life, prosperity, health!—the Son of Re: Set-nakht Merer-Re Meri-Amon—life, prosperity, health! He was Khepri-Seth when he was enraged. He brought to order the entire land, which had been rebellious. He slew the disaffected of heart who had been in Egypt. He cleansed the great throne of Egypt.
1 Ramses III (about 1 1 9 5 - 1 1 6 4 B.C.). 2 The epithet normally means that the king is already dead. For the thesis that Papyrus Harris was actually promulgated by Ramses IV in the name of his father Ramses III, see W. Struve, in Aegyptus, vn ( 1 9 2 6 ) , 3«· 3 Egyptian captive or mercenary troops, coming from the Mediterranean area. cf. p. 255, n.2. 4 That is, broken down under local rule only, without king or other central government. 5 Either years void of orderly rule, or years of emptiness, i.e. of economic distress. 6 This translation treats the text on the assumption that the actual name of the Syrian has dropped out, leaving only the determinatives which show a foreigner. Alternatively, instead of translating "made himself," one may treat these elements as a proper name and read: "and Irsu, a Syrian, was with them as prince." In either case, the rule of an otherwise unknown Syrian ("Horite") is certain.
From the Lists of Ramses III
The course of the Egyptian Empire was marked by a rapid increase in the wealth and power of the Egyptian temples. We have a kind of testamentary enactment of Ramses III (about 1195-1164 B.C.) of the Twentieth Dynasty stating the accumulated properties of the temples through his benefactions. One authority has estimated that at die close of this pharaoh's reign the temples owned about 2 0 % of the population of Egypt as serfs and about 3 0 % of the arable land.1 Our interest in the long document will be confined to the indications of Egyptian contacts with Asia.

1 So H. D. Schaedel, Die Listen des grossen Papyrus Harris (Leipziger agyptologische Studien, 6, Gluckstadt, 1 9 3 6 ) , 67. However, the true meaning of the lists is still in debate, and the number of unknown factors is large. Breasted, op.cit., §§ 166-67, estimated that the temples owned 2% of the people and 1 5 % of the land. 2 Three separate types of ships, perhaps all cargo vessels capable of sea travel. 3 The east generally, the Arabian or east African coast as well as the Palestinian-Phoenician coast. 4 Djahi here clearly includes "the Canaan" and is an area to which the people of Retenu (the Syrian-Palestinian highland) normally would come. One may point to a settlement of Ramses III at Beth-Shan in Palestine, but this may have been one of several such settlements; see A. Rowe, The Topography and History of Beth-Shan (Philadelphia, 1 9 3 0 ) , 38 ff.

5 "Towns of Kharu and Cush." Note that the summarizing section below —perhaps only by inadvertence—gives only "towns of Kharu," and that all the foreign towns are credited to the god Amon. • "Kharu" (Hurru, Horites) and "Nehsi," the two terms used at this time for the northern and southern neighbors. 7 Amon, Mut, and Khonsu formed the Theban triad of gods. The 2,607 foreigners are part of a total of 86,486 persons added to the Theban estates under Ramses III. T h e 2,093 foreigners are part of a total of 12',364 persons added to the Heliopolitan estates. The 205 foreigners are part of a total of 3,079 persons added to the Memphite estates. In these lists of temple serfs, the word tep " h e a d , " is regularly used for the Egyptian serfs. In the case of the Theban and Memphite lists, the word sep "case," is used for the foreign serfs. 8 It is not absolutely certain that these were foreigners. "Others" may mean "outsiders, foreigners," or it may mean "the common people, the rabble." 9 The term maryanu was used for Asiatic warriors in this period, cf. p. 22, n.2. T h e term 'apiru has been argued to mean "aliens," particularly applicable to foreign slave labor, perhaps the same word as ffabiru, and thus etymologically related to "Hebrew"—but not implying that these captives were Israelites. See p. 247, n.47 above.

10 Four or five terms for cattle are used, and we do not know enough about the different kinds to translate with precision. Further, it is not clear whether we have four kinds followed by a fifth or whether we have four kinds followed by an apposition: "(which are the) cattle from the dues of the lands of Syria." 11 Amon's Asiatic cattle numbered 19, out of a total of 866 presented annually to his temple. For the argument that this was annual delivery, see A. H. Gardiner in JEA, xxvii ( 1 9 4 1 ) , 72-73. T h e summarizing section, here translated immediately after the Theban section, shows that only Amon received these Asiatic cattle. 12Sherit (a plant, assumed to be a kind of barley) of Kharu. T h e annual amount would be less than 3 pecks. 13 A little over 6 bushels, of which Memphis received 8/9 annually. 14 T h e amounts in volume of the men-)xc measure and of the mcsc\hjar measure are unknown. 15 The word translated "slabs" might mean "beams" or similar. The word translated "mast" was a major timber in shipbuilding. 16 The word translated "beams" is used in shipbuilding—apparently for the ribs or side-planks.

I. SUMMARY OF NORTHERN WARS
I extended all the frontiers of Egypt and overthrew those who had attacked them from their (lxxvi 7) lands. I slew the Denyen in their islands, while the Tjeker and the Philistines were made ashes. The Sherden and the Weshesh of the Sea were made nonexistent, captured all together and brought in captivity to Egypt like the sands of the shore.18 I settled them in strongholds, bound in my name.19 Their military classes were as numerous as hundred-thousands. I assigned portions for them all with clothing and provisions from the treasuries and granaries every year.20 I destroyed the people of Seir among the Bedouin tribes.211 razed their tents: their people, their property, and their cattle as well, without number, pinioned and carried away in captivity, as the tribute of Egypt. I gave them to the Ennead of the gods, as slaves for their houses.
T h e W a r Against the Peoples
of the Sea
In the latter half of the second millennium B.C. there were extensive movements in the eastern Mediterranean area. Masses of homeless peoples moved slowly across the sea and its coastlands, displacing or merging with the older populations. These migrations ended the Minoan civilization in Crete, contributed to the historical populations of Greece and Italy, wiped out the Hittite Empire, thrust the Philistines into Canaan, and washed up on the shores of Egypt. In Ramses Ill's eighth year (about 1x88 B.C.) the pharaoh met and checked their attempt to push into the rich lands of the Nile. The victory was only a check, because the Egyptian Empire in Asia ended shortly after. The following accounts of this war come from Ramses Ill's temple of Medinet Habu at Thebes. The texts were published by the Epigraphic Expedition,
17 The total of the three preceding sections. 18 The reference is to Ramses Ill's war against the Sea Peoples in his 8th year; cf. pp. 262-263 below. For the Tjeker, cf. the Wen-Amon story (p. 26, n.5 above). The Denyen (Danaoi), the Sherden (Sardians?), and the Weshesh (Wasasa?) were also participants in this great restlessness on the eastern Mediterranean in the latter half of the 2nd millennium B.C. 19 Foreign captives were branded with the name of pharaoh. cf. Breasted, op.cit., §405; T h e Epigraphic Survey, Earlier Historical Records of Ramses III (Medinet Habu, 1, OIP, v m , Chicago, 1 9 3 0 ) » PI. 4 2 ·
20 Not: "I taxed diem all with," etc. Foreign captives were not taxworthy, but did need food and clothing from the state stores. 21 It is interesting that Ramses Ill's only statement here of a campaign against Semitic peoples deals with the nomads of the region to the south of the Dead Sea. His scenes depicting campaigns into Syria-Palestine on the walls of his temple of Medinet Habu may all be pious or propagandistic forgeries—The Epigraphic Survey, Later Historical Records of Ramses HI (Medinet Habu, n, OIP, ix, Chicago, 1 9 3 2 ) , Pis. 87-99; cf· w· F· Edgerton and J. A. Wilson, Historical Records of Ramses III (SAOC, 1 2 , Chicago, 1936)» 94. n.3b. Ramses III did have a temple at Beth-Shan and did have relations with Megiddo (p. 263 below), but he may have been unable to campaign north of Palestine, and he may have held garrison posts in Palestine without fighting. The complete collapse of the Egyptian Empire in Asia seems to have come shortly after his reign.

( 1 ) Year 8 under the majesty of (Ramses III) (16) . . . The foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands. All at once the lands were removed and scattered in the fray. No land could stand before their arms, from Hatti, Kode, Carchemish, Arzawa, and Alashiya on,1 being cut off at [one time]. A camp [was set up] in one place in Amor.2 They desolated its people, and its land was like that which has never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt, while the flame was prepared before them. Their confederation was the Philistines, Tjeker, Shekelesh, Denye(n), and Weshesh,8 lands united. They laid their hands upon the lands as far as the circuit of the earth, their hearts confident and trusting: "Our plans will succeed!" Now the heart of this god, the Lord of the Gods, was prepared and ready to ensnare them like birds I organized my frontier in Djahi,4 prepared before them:princes, commanders of garrisons, (20) and maryanu.5 I have the river-mouths6 prepared like a strong wall, with warships, galleys and coasters, (fully) equipped, for they were manned completely from bow to stern with valiant warriors carrying their weapons. The troops consisted of every picked man of Egypt. They were like lions roaring upon the mountain tops. The chariotry consisted of runners, of picked men, of every good and capable chariot-warrior. The horses were quivering in every part of their bodies, prepared to crush the foreign countries under their hoofs. I was the valiant Montu,7 standing fast at their head, so that they might gaze upon the capturing of my hands....
Those who reached my frontier, their seed is not, their heart and their soul are finished forever and ever. Those who came forward together on the sea, the full
1 Hatti was the Hittite Empire, Kode the coast of Cilicia and northern Syria, Carchemish the city on the Euphrates, Arzawa somewhere in or near Cilicia, and Alashiya probably Cyprus. 2 Perhaps in the north Syrian plain or in Coele-Syria. 3 Except for the Philistines (Peleset), these names are rendered close to the Egyptian writings. For the Tjeker, cf. the Wen-Amon story (pp. 25-29 above). The Shekelesh might be the Siculi, the Denyen (cuneiform Danuna) might be the Danaoi. The Weshesh cannot easily be related to any later people, cf. G. Bonfante, Who were the Philistines?, in AJA, L (1946) 251-62. * The Phoenician coast, running down into Palestine. From what little we know of Ramses Ill's sway, his defensive frontier was not north of Palestine. It is possible that the land batde against the Peoples of the Sea was in Asia, whereas the sea battle was on the coast of Egypt; cf. n.6 below. 5 From its pictured determinative, the word "princes" meant Asiatics. The maryanu were Asiatic warriors; see p. 2 2 , n.2. 9 Normally used for the mouths of the branches of the Nile in the Delta. Hence probably the line of defense in Egypt. Just possibly, the word might have been extended to harborages on the Asiatic coast. 7 The Egyptian god of war.

flame was in front of them at the river-mouths, while a stockade of lances surrounded them on the shore.8 They were dragged in, enclosed, and prostrated on the beach, killed, and made into heaps from tail to head. Their ships and their goods were as if fallen into the water. I have made the lands turn back from (even) mentioning Egypt; for when they pronounce my name in their land, then (25) they are burned up. Since I sat upon the throne of Har-akhti and the Great-of-Magic9 was fixed upon my head like Re, I have not let foreign countries behold the frontier of Egypt, to boast thereof to the Nine Bows.101 have taken away their land, their frontiers being added to mine.

This is a scene showing Ramses III and his troops on the march against the Peoples of the Sea. It moves forward into a scene (PI. 32 of the publication), in which the pharaoh is engaged in a land batde with the invaders. The logic of this arrangement is that the land batde was in Djahi.
His majesty sets out for Djahi, like unto Montu, to crush every foreign country that violates his frontier. His troops are like bulls ready upon the field of battle; his horses are like falcons in the midst of small birds

This scene shows a naval batde, in which the Egyptian ships grapple with the vessels of the Sea Peoples, while the pharaoh and his land troops fight from the shore.
Now then, the northern countries which were in their islands were quivering in their bodies. They penetrated the channels of the river-mouths. Their nostrils have ceased (to function, so) their desire is to breathe the breath. His majesty has gone forth like a whirlwind against them, fighting on the battlefield like a runner.

into their bodies. They are capsized and overwhelmed where they are. Their heart is taken away, their soul is flown away. Their weapons are scattered upon the sea. His arrow pierces whom of them he may have wished, and the fugitive is become one fallen into the water.1* His majesty is like an enraged lion, attacking his assailant with his arms: plundering on his right hand and powerful on his left hand, like Seth destroying the serpent "Evil of Character."14 It is Amon-Re who has overthrown for him the lands and has crushed for him every land under his feet
T h e Megiddo Ivories
A large collection of "Phoenician ivories" was found by excavation in a palace at Megiddo in Palestine. The carved designs were cosmopolitanly derived from various culture areas of the ancient Near East. The excavator tentatively dates the manufacture of the pieces between 1350 and 1150 B.C. Among the ivories are five bearing Egyptian hieroglyphs. A model pen case of an Egyptian envoy to foreign countries bears the name of Ramses III (about 1195-1164 B.C.), setting the terminus ad quern for the collection. The ivories were published by G. Loud, The Megiddo Ivories ( O I P , LII, Chicago, 1939), with a translation of the hieroglyphic inscriptions by J. A. Wilson on pp. 11-13. Photographs of the Egyptian pieces appear on Pis. 62-63.
Three plaques, which may have been used for inlay in furniture, bear the name of
the Singer of Ptah, South-of-His-Wall, Lord of the Life of the T w o Lands, and Great Prince of Ashkelon, Kerker.
Kerker (or Kurkur or Kulkul) seems to have been a woman minstrel for the Egyptian god Ptah in Palestine, like the woman singer at the court of Byblos in the Wen-Amon story (pp. 28, n.39; 246, n.30, above). The first two of Ptah's tides apply to his cult-home at Memphis in Egypt, the third—"Great Prince of Ashkelon"—implies a cult-seat at that Palestinian city.* For the relations of Egypt and Asia about 1100 B.C., see the Journey of Wen-Amon to Phoenicia (pp. 25-29 above).
T h e Campaign of Sheshonk I
Sheshonk I (about 945-924 B.C.) is the Shishak of the Old Testament. It is disappointing to find that the Egyptian texts do not enlarge our understanding of his campaign in Palestine in a sense which constitutes a real addition to the biblical account. To be sure, he has left us a listing of the Palestinian and Syrian towns which he claimed to have conquered, and this list may be reconstructed into a kind of itinerary.1 There is, however, no narrative account of the campaign by the pharaoh. The references in his inscriptions to "tribute of the land of Syria" or to his victories over the "Asiatics of distant foreign countries" are vague and generalized. How unhistorical his large claims were is clear from a statement to the pharaoh by the god Amon: "I have subjugated [for] thee the Asiatics of the armies of

Mitanni."2 Mitanni as a nation had ceased to exist at least four centuries earlier. In addition to the list of towns, we do possess two documents attesting the name of Sheshonk on Asiatic soil. At Megiddo in Palestine was found a fragment of a monumental stela bearing the name of Sheshonk I and permitting the conclusion that the pharaoh had set up a triumphal monument there.8 At Byblos in

Phoenicia another fragment, this time the chair of a seated statue, bears his name, although this monument may well be a princely gift, rather than a symbol of conquest.4 Finally, the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore has a basalt statuette of an Egyptian, the "Envoy of the Canaan and of Palestine, Pa-di-Eset, the son of Apy," which may date to the Twenty-second Dynasty. This piece does not involve conquest, but rather diplomatic relations.5

Babylonian and Assyrian Historical Texts
TRANSLATOR: A. LEO OPPENHEIM
Texts from the Beginnings to
the First Dynasty of Babylon
For this section, two documents have been selected to illustrate the content and the stylistic features of early Mesopotamian historiography, while two groups of texts have been translated to represent the historical source material, which is rather rare in this period. The texts of the first part are: ( i ) an excerpt of the Sumerian King List, and (2) the "Sargon Chronicle." The second part contains ( 1 ) two inscriptions from statues of Sargon of Agade, (2) an excerpt from an inscription of Naram-Sin, and ( 3 ) excerpts from three inscriptions of the well-known Gudea of Lagash.
HISTORIOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTS
I. THE SUMERIAN KING LIST
In his book The Sumerian King List (AS, No. 1 1 ) , Thorkild Jacobsen offers not only a critical edition of the entire text material1 and an excellent translation,2 but also critical examination of all textual, stylistic, and historical problems involved. On the basis of a systematic study of the numerous variant readings, Jacobsen has shown that all extant "manuscripts" go back to one single original written at the time of Utu-hegal, king of Uruk, the liberator of Sumer from the yoke of the Guti domination. To demonstrate that his country had always been united under one king—though these kings were ruling successively in different capitals—the learned and patriotic author compiled this interesting document from two types of literary sources: from lists containing the names of the kings, the places and the lengths of their rules (established originally for practical chronological purposes), and from epical texts, legendary stories, local anecdotic traditions, etc., dealing with the biography and the marvelous deeds of some of these primeval kings. This literary material is referred to in very succinct sentences scattered throughout the monotonous enumeration of royal names, figures, and place names. To this opus has later been added a section dealing with the events before the Flood. This "preamble" has an entirely different literary background8 and does not appear in all manuscripts.
The entire text material has been utilized by Thorkild Jacobsen (The Sumerian King List) to establish a "standard version" of this document on the basis of the most extensive "manuscript" published by S. Langdon from the Weld-Blundell Collection (= Oxford Edition of Cuneiform Texts, Vol. 11 [Oxford, 1923]), No. 1923, 444, pp. 13 S. and Pis. I-IV. The following translation contains lines i 1—iv 5 with the "ante-diluvian" preamble (cf. above) and the historical survey from the beginnings to the end of the First Dynasty of Ur. This section has been selected because it contains the names of the kings who ruled for an excessive length of time as well as nearly all the passages of mythological and literary interest.

Jacobsen. 8 cf., for a more detailed discussion, Jacobsen, op.cit., pp. 63 f.
When kingship was lowered from heaven, kingship was (first) in Eridu. (In) Eridu, A-lulim4 (became) king and ruled 28,800 years. Alalgar ruled 36,000 years. Two kings (thus) ruled it for 64,800 years. I drop (the topic) Eridu (because) its kingship was brought to Bad-tibira. (In) Bad-tibira, En-men-lu-Anna ruled 43,200 years; En-men-gal-Anna ruled 28,800 years; the god Dumu-zi, a shepherd, ruled 36,000 years. Three kings (thus) ruled it for 108,000 years. I drop (the topic) Bad-tibira (because) its kingship was brought to Larak. (In) Larak, En-sipa-zi-Anna ruled 28,800 years. One king (thus) ruled it for 28,800 years. I drop (the topic) Larak (because) its kingship was brought to Sippar. (In) Sippar, En-men-dur-Anna became king and ruled 21,000 years. One king (thus) ruled it for 21,000 years. I drop (the topic) Sippar (because) its kingship was brought to Shuruppak. (In) Shuruppak, Ubar-Tutu became king and ruled 18,600 years. One king (thus) ruled it for 18,600 years. These are five cities, eight kings ruled them for 241,000 years. (Then) the Flood swept over (the earth). After the Flood had swept over (the earth) (and) when kingship was lowered (again) from heaven, kingship was (first) in Kish. In Kish, Ga[ . . . ]ur became king and ruled 1,200 years—(original) destroyed! legible (only) to heavenly Nidaba (the goddess of writing) —ruled 960 years.

Kish was defeated in battle (lit.: was smitten with weapons), its kingship was removed to Eanna (sacred precinct of Uruk). In Eanna, Mes-kiag-gasher, the son of the (sun) god Utu, became high priest as well as king, and ruled 324 years.

2. THE "SARGON CHRONICLE"
While in the Sumerian King List the references to legendary, pseudo-historical, and historical traditions occur only sporadically and are subordinated to the chronological framework elaborated by the author, here they have overgrown the basically annalistic structure in a type of chronicle to be represented by two tablets of the same series.1 This literary work centers its attention around the most interesting of the historical figures and reports their outstanding achievements in peace and war with special regard to the unique and the memorable. Important events in neighboring countries as well as foreign invasions are recorded from time to time. For a literary evaluation of this document, cf. H. G. Giiterbock, ZA, XLII ( N F VIII), I if.

Sargon (Sarru-^en), king of Agade, rose (to power) in the era of Ishtar2 and had neither rival nor opponent. He spread his terror-inspiring glamor over all the countries. He crossed the Sea in the East and he, himself, conquered the country of the West, in its full extent,

in the n t h year (of his rule). He established there a central government (lit.: he made its mouth be one). He erected his stelae in the West. Their booty (i.e. the booty of the countries in the Eastern and Western Seas) he ferried over on rafts. He made his court officials live (around his residence, thus covering an area) of five double-miles, and held sway over the totality of the countries, without exception. He marched against the country of Kazalla8 and turned Kazalla into ruin-hills and heaps (of rubble).8* He (even) destroyed (there every possible) perching place for a bird. Afterwards, in his old age, all the countries revolted against him and they besieged him in Agade. (But) Sargon made an armed sortie and defeated them, knocked them over, and crushed their vast army. Later on, Subartu4 rose with its multitudes, but it bowed to his military might. Sargon made sedentary this nomadic society.5 Their possessions he brought into Agade. He took away earth from the (foundation) pits6 of Babylon and he built upon it a(nother) Babylon beside the town of Agade. On account of the sacrilege he (thus) committed, the great lord Marduk became enraged and destroyed his people by hunger. From the East to the West he alienated7 (them) from him and inflicted upon [him] (as punishment) that he could not rest (in his grave).8 Naram-Sin, son of Sargon, marched against the town of Apishal9 and made a breach (in its wall to conquer it). He personally caught Rish-Adad, king of Apishal, and the s u ^ a l of Apishal. He (also) marched against the country Magan and personally caught Mannudannu, king of Magan.10 Shulgi,11 son of Ur-Nammu, took very good care of the town of Eridu which is on the seashore (but) he had evil intentions and he removed the property of the
8 The British Museum text K 2130, a collection of hepatoscopic omina referring to historical events and personalities (first published in Rawlinson, Vol. iv, PI. 34, No. 1 ) , gives the name of the king of Kazalla, to wit: Kashtubila. ·• For this translation of the well-known nouns tillu u \armu cf. E. F.
Weidner in Melanges syriens, 11, 924, n.5. 4 My translation differs from the usual by emending the vertical wedge
before matSu-bir«kl. The use of the verbs tebu and \am&su fits much better
into the thus corrected phrase, and so does the word gipiu, which normally describes an unorganized army and therefore seems more likely to refer to
the army of Subartu than to that of Sargon. The lines 1 5 - 1 6 (abikta-iu-nu
im-has \a-mar-lu-nu ii-\un um-man-iu-nu rapaltimu-lam-qi-it) have been omitted as an erroneous repetition of lines 1 2 - 1 3 . 5 Conjectural translation, text in disorder. 6 This passage (and its parallel in the so-called "Weidner-Chronicle," cf.
H. G. Guterbock, ZA, XLII [ N F v m ] , 47 ff., rev. 1 7 ) has been lately
elucidated by Guterbock, in AfO, XIII (1940-41), 50, who connected it with
is(s)& "pit." The passage seems therefore to suggest that the contents (clean earth and sand) of the well-known deep pits under the emplacements of the images were considered endowed with the very essence of the "holiness" which pervaded the image, its temple, and its sacred city. 7 The subject of all three verbs is necessarily Marduk.

HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS
I. SARGON OF AGADE
The tablet is large, with 14 columns on either side, containing copies of inscriptions on votive objects and statues set up in the temple Ekur in Nippur. According to its paleographic features, the tablet was written soon after the rule of the Dynasty of Agade. The inscriptions are those of Lugalzaggisi, king of Uruk, and of Sargon, Rimush, Manishtusu, kings of Agade. Two fragments of this tablet have been successively published by A. Poebel in Historical and Grammatical Texts (Philadelphia, 1914, UM, v), PI. xx, No. 34, and by L. Legrain, The Museum Journal (University of Pennsylvania), xiv (1923), 203 ff., Figs. 42-44.

Lugalzaggisi, king of Uruk, he captured in (this) battle, he brought him in a (dog) collar to the gate of Enlil. Sargon, king of Agade, was victorious in the battle with the inhabitants of Ur, the(ir) town he defeated and tore down its wall. He defeated (the town) E-Ninmar and tore down its wall and defeated (also) its (entire) territory from Lagash as far as the sea. His weapon (then) he washed in the sea. In the battle with the inhabitants of Umma he was victorious, the(ir) town he defeated and tore down its wall. Enlil did not let anybody oppose Sargon, the king of the country. Enlil gave him (the region from) the Upper Sea (to) the Lower Sea. From the Lower Sea onwards, natives of Agade are holding the governorships. Mari and Elam are standing (in obedience) before Sargon, king of the country. Sargon, king of the country, restored Kish, he ordered them to take (again) possession of the(ir) city.

2. NARAM-SIN IN THE CEDAR M O U N T A I N 1
The text, published, transliterated, and translated by C. J. Gadd and L. Legrain in UET, as No. 275 (Vol. 1, pp. 74 if.; Vol. n, PI. LVI) is taken from a collection of late copies (approximately, Dynasty of Isin or First Babylonian Dynasty) made on a clay tablet from inscriptions of the kings of the dynasty of Agade The copies are negligendy made and offer therefore many difficulties.
(i I—ii 28)
Although since the era of the si-k\i\-t? of man(kind) none of the kings has ever destroyed8 (the towns) Arman and Ibla, now* the god Nergal did open up the path for the mighty5 Naram-Sin, and gave him Arman and Ibla, and he presented him (also) with the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain and (with) the Upper Sea. And mighty Naram-Sin slew Arman and Ibla with the "weapon" of the god Dagan who aggrandizes his kingdom. And h e . . a l l the peoples with which Dagan had presented him for the first time,7 from the Euphrates frontier as far as Ulisum and .. .8 the corvee-basket for his god Amal. And he overpowered9 the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain.
4 At this period, Magan and Meluhha are probably denominations of still unidentified countries on the eastern shores of Arabia. With the expanding geographical horizon, these names shift constandy towards the southeastern peripheral regions of the known orbis terrarum. cf. e.g., W. F. Albright, JAOS, XLn ( 1 9 2 2 ) , 3 1 7 ff. 5 For this country, its geographical location, and its meaning within a certain type of Mesopotamian literature, cf. S. N. Kramer, BASOR, 96 ( 1 9 4 4 ) , 18-26; and A . L . Oppenheim, JAOS, LXXIV ( 1 9 5 4 ) , 6 - 1 7 . 8 cf. for this town I. J. Gelb in AJSL, LV ( 1 9 3 8 ) , 74.
1 In the context, the expression "Cedar Mountain" clearly refers to the Amanus, but there are indications that this basically "mytho-geographic" term denotes also a region east of Mesopotamia, cf. S. N. Kramer BASOR, 96 (1944). 20 ff. 2 Though one expects here a reference to the creation of man or the like, the term li\ittu is difficult to interpret in this sense. 8 Text: u-sa-al-bi-tu.
4 For in Iu(?)-e in this very dubious meaning, reference has to be made to Landsberger's guess in OLZ, x x x i v ( 1 9 3 1 ) , 1 3 1 . 5 Translation uncertain; "mighty" is nominative. 6 Text: u-ra-is which is usually interpreted (cf. von Soden, ZA, xui [ N F VII], 170) as "he crushed," but the context and the reference to the corvie-basket suggest a verb (expected: wara'u) referring to a transfer of the conquered population for forced labor. 7 For this translation, cf. Jacobsen in AJSL, xuvi ( 1 9 2 9 ) , 70. 8 The text seems to have na-st-ni/um (to nalSu "to carry"?) not na-abnum. 8 Text: i-ikjg-mu-ur.

. . . from Elam came the Elamite(s), from Susa the Susian(s). Magan and Meluhha collected timber from their mountains, and—in order to build the temple of Ningirsu—Gudea brought (these materials) together in his town Girsu. After the god Ninzagga had given him a (pertinent) order, they brought copper for Gudea, the templebuilder as if it be NI. s e. m a h ; after the god Ninsikila had given him a (pertinent) order, they brought great willow-logs, ebony-logs, together with a b b a -logs to the e n s i , the temple-builder. Gudea, the en -priest of Ningirsu, made a path in (to) the Cedar Mountain which nobody had entered (before); he cut its cedars with great axes. With axes he fashioned (them) for the SAR.UR, the "Right Arm of Lagash," the "FloodstormWeapon" of his king. (Like) giant snakes, cedar rafts were floating down the water (of the river) from the Cedar Mountain, pine rafts from the Pine Mountain, z a b a 1 u m -wood rafts from the z a b a 1 u m -wood Mountain, and with them were floating down (stream) large rafts with great logs of u -wood, t u 1 u b u m -wood and of e r a l u m -wood, in the main quay of Kasurra

Many other precious materials were carried to the e n s i , the builder of the Ninnu-temple: from the copper mountains of Kimash—(after) the soil had been prospected (for copper ore)—its copper was mined in clusters;2 gold was delivered from its mine (lit.: mountain) as dust for the e n s i who wanted to build a house for his king, for Gudea they mined silver from its mine (lit.: mountain), delivered red stone from Meluhha in great amounts. In the I i r -quarry, they mined I i r -stone (alabaster) for him.

girsu, Ningirsu, his beloved king, opened up for'him (all) the (trade) routes from the Upper to the Lower Sea. In (lit.: from) the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain, he formed into rafts cedar logs 60 cubits long, cedar logs 50 cubits long (and) KU-wood logs 25 cubits long, and brought them (thus) out of the mountain. He fashioned (from this wood) for him (i.e. Ningirsu) the SAR.UR, his Floodstorm-Weapon for the battle, and he made for him the sAR.GAZ-mace with seven copper knobs (lit.: eyes). In the town Ursu1 in the mountains of Ibla,1 he formed into rafts the timber of the mountain region: z a b a l u m -logs, great IJ.KU-wood logs and t u 1 u b u m -logs. He made them into roof beams for (lit.: in) the Ninnu-temple. In (lit.: from) Umanum, in the mountains of Menua, he quarried great blocks of stone (and also) in Basalla, in the mountains of Martu (i.e. the Westland). He made stelae of them and set them up in the courtyard of the Ninnu-temple. From Tidanum2 in the mountains of Martu (Westland) he brought alabaster in great blocks and fashioned it into u r. p a d. d a -slabs and erected them in the temple as barriers. In KA.GAL.AD, a mountain (region) in Kimash, he mined copper and fashioned it into the Mace-of-the-Relentless-Storm.

Texts from Hammurabi to the
Downfall of the Assyrian Empire
The six texts of the first part (Historiographic Documents) illustrate the development of official historiography in Mesopotamia; at the same time, they give the chronological framework (in terms of the sequence of dynasties) and most of the royal names from the First Babylonian Dynasty to the end of the Assyrian domination in Babylonia. The first text ( 1 ) contains the full wording of the names of the forty-three years during which Hammurabi was king of Babylon. The present list is based upon the compilation of A. Ungnad in his article, Datenlisten, in the ReaUexi^pn der Assyriologie, 11, 187 S., in which he collected the names and arranged them in the sequence indicated by the official lists of abbreviated year-names. Such a list, compiled for obvious practical purposes, is given in the next text (2) which covers the thirty-eight years of the rule of Samsuiluna, son of Hammurabi. The so-called Babylonian King List B, translated here under (3), shows a further step of this development It contains the names of all the kings of the First Dynasty of Babylon with the lengths of their reigns and—as a rule—their relation to their predecessors. The last line sums up the number of kings and indicates the name of the dynasty. The reverse of the same tablet lists the kings of another dynasty in exacdy the same way. The unfortunately damaged tablet known as Babylonian King List A (4) lists first the kings of the Hammurabi Dynasty and continues the sequence of dynasties to the domination of Babylon by Assyrian kings, Kandalanu, the Babylonian successor of Shamashshumukin, being the last name before a break. From this "raw material" the historiographers of later periods compiled such lists as are exemplified in the famous Assyrian King List of Khorsabad, for which I refer—provisionally—to the articles of A. Poebel in the JNES, 1, 247 if., 460 if.; and 11, 56 if. (cf., also, E. F. Weidner, AfO, xrv [1944], 362 flf.) The Synchronistic Chronicle (5) deals with the period covered by the preceding text; its author, however, is not interested in dynasties and lengths of rule, but in relating chronologically, or synchronizing, the kings of Assyria (left column) with those of Babylonia (right column). The basic principle of arrangement is to mention within the same paragraph the names of the kings of one country who ascended the throne during the reign of the king of the other country. As an interesting innovation, the name of the vizier is mentioned in certain cases beside that of the ruling king. The Excerpts from the Lists of Assyrian Eponyms (6) illustrate these Assyrian historiographic documents as a source of historic information.
HISTORIOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTS
I. LIST OF DATE FORMULAE
OF THE REIGN OF HAMMURABI
This list has been compiled by A. Ungnad, in ReaUexi\pn der Assyriologie, 11,178-182. For the official lists containing the abbreviated names of the years of the kings of the First Dynasty of Babylon, cf. the text material collected by Ungnad, opxit., pp. 164 if.
1. Hammurabi (became) king. 2. He established justice1 in the country.
1 This refers to a royal act aiming at the restoration of the social equity whenever economic or other changes created a discrepancy between the social status established and protected by law (termed kjttu "correct/normal [status]") and the needs, or claims, of certain groups of the population. Under such circumstances, it is the official duty of the king to "make (Akk.: iak&nu, Sum.: g a r ) miiaru (Sum.: n i g . s i . s 4 ) " i.e., to readjust the law to the necessities of an ever changing world. In practice, however, miiaram la\anum refers probably always to a remission of (certain) debts or to a moratory, cf. also B. Landsberger, Die baby

The hero who proclaims the triumphs of Marduk, overthrew in battle with his powerful weapon the army of Eshnunna, Subartu (and) Gutium and was a match (also) for the country Mankizum and the country along the bank of the Tigris as far as (the frontier of) the country Subartu. 33. He redug the canal (called) "Hammurabi(spells)-abundance-for-the-people, the Beloved-ofAnu-and-Enlil," (thus) he provided Nippur, Eridu, Ur, Larsa, Uruk (and) Isin with a permanent and plentiful water supply, and reorganized Sumer and Akkad from (its) confusion (lit.: scattering). Mari and Malgi he overthrew in battle and made Mari, and . . . and also several other cities of Subartu, by a friendly agreement, (listen) to his orders. 34.

He restored the temple e . m e . t e . u r . s a g ("The Pride of the Hero") and built the temple tower, the mighty abode of Zababa11 (and) Inanna, whose top is sky-high and (thus) he greatly increased the glamor of Zababa as well as of Inanna in a pious manner. 37.

10 The text uses the verb s i . . . s & which, in legal texts, means "to correspond in value." 11 The reading Ilbaba (cf. R. Labat, in Revue des etudes semitiques
1942-45/1, pp. 1-8) has to be abandoned (cf. E. F. Weidner, AfK, 11, 1925, p. 13 n. x, 7. AfO, xiii, 1939-40, p. 318). 12 The reference to the wisdom which inspired this warlike exploit seems to suggest an attack made by Hammurabi upon the stricken city. This would offer an interesting parallel to the incident reported by the Pharaoh Pi-ankhi at the conquest of Memphis.

6. EXCERPTS FROM THE LISTS OF ASSYRIAN EPONYMS
In contradistinction to the Babylonian custom (attested from the time of the kings of Agade to that of the Kassite rulers) of naming each year after an important event, the Assyrians used the names of certain high officials for the same purpose. The first (full) year of the reign of a king is always named after himself, the following years have originally been named after that official who won when lots were thrown to determine the eponym.1 Later on, the position of the official within the hierarchy was decisive for the sequence, the highest official (tartanu) following the king immediately, while important palace officers (such as, e.g. the nagir e\alli "overseer of the royal property," the chief cupbearer, etc.) and the governors of the foremost provinces took their turn in well-established order. After the exhaustion of all eligible candidates for the office of the limu, within the rule of one and the same king, the sequence of officials started anew, beginning with the king. For the throwing of lots (done by means of a "die" called puru thrown into a bowl), cf. E. F. Weidner, AfO, XIII (1941), 308 f.;2 for the sequence of officials, cf. E. Forrer, Die Provinzeinteilung des assyrischen Reiches (Leipzig, 1921), after p. 6, with an instructive diagram. For practical and chronological purposes, the Assyrian scribes made elaborate lists3 of the names of the limu -officials which either contain only name and rank (termed by Delitzsch: C[anon]a) or additional short notices referring to historical events (Cb).4 These lists have been studied and edited repeatedly, the most recent studies being those of A. Ungnad in Reallexicon der Assyriologie, 11, sub Eponym, 412-457, and E. F.
Weidner, AfO, XIII ( 1 9 4 1 ) , 3 0 8 - 3 1 8 . The following excerpts utilize A. Ungnad's transliteration and restoration of Cb on pp. 428 if., to the arrangement of which the numbering of lines refers.

3 The possibility that the rows of stelae found in Ashur are meant to serve as a sort of monumental " i n d e x " of limu -officials, has been discussed by A. Ungnad, op.cit., p. 4 1 2 . These officials would then have had two essentially royal prerogatives: to give their name to the year and to set up stelae. * Various other types of such lists (rarely attested, however) are mentioned by Ungnad, op.cit., p. 4 1 4 .

W. J. Martin, Tribut und Tribudeistungen bei den Assyrern, Studio Orientalia, v i n ( 1 9 3 6 ) , 20 ff. The hendiadys biltu mandattu is, in the present pages, translated by one English term (to wit, "tribute"), because it is not admissible to render literally the well-known stylistic feature of the Akkadian (cf. H. Ehelolf, Ein Wortfolgeprinzip im Assyrisch-Babylonischen, LSS, v i / 3 [ 1 9 1 6 ] ) to use two nearly synonymous nouns to express one concept on the level of a solemn and dignified diction. Therefore I translate, e.g., qablu (u) tähazu simply with "battle," büiu (u) ma\\uru with "possessions," hittu (u) milaru with "justice," etc.

From such references as e.g. nalparu dannu (cf. below p. 309, n.4), suk_kallu dannu ("regular suk.Ka^u -official"), etc., the meaning "legitimate, orderly, correct" results (cf. also Deimel, §L, 3 2 2 / 1 8 for the Sum. verb k a 1 a ( g ) "to deliver regularly"), while other references point towards dannu in the meaning "potent, full-grown, powerful." With regard to the ancient Near Eastern concept of kingship, it seems possible that the title is meant to express both aspects: the legitimacy of the ruler and his full personal vigor, both being equally essential prerequisites for the exercise of kingship. 2 For the history of this age-old royal title, cf. p. 267, n.i.

At the command of my lord Ashur I was a conqueror (lit.: my hand conquered) from beyond the Lower Zab River to the Upper Sea which (lies towards) the West. Three times I did march against the Nairi countries. The widespread Nairi countries I conquered from the country Tumme as far as Daiaeni, Himua, and even as far as Paiteri and Habhi. I made bow to my feet 30 kings of the Nairi countries, I took hostages from them. I received as their tribute horses, broken to the yoke. I imposed upon them (regular) tribute and tdmariu-gihs.
I went to the Lebanon (Lab-na-a-ni). I cut (there) timber of cedars for the temple of Anu and Adad, the great gods, my lords, and carried (them to Ashur).

I departed from the country Bit-Adini and crossed the Euphrates at the peak of its flood by means of (rafts made buoyant with inflated) goatskin (bottle)s. I advanced towards Carchemish. (There) I received from him (self) the tribute of Sangara, the king of the Hittites (amounting to): 20 talents of silver, a saaru object of gold, a ring of gold, golden daggers, 100 talents of copper, 250 talents of iron, (furthermore) bullimages1 of copper, copper basin-and-ewer sets2 for washing, a copper brazier—(all) his own furniture,8 the weights of which were not taken (separately),—(furthermore) beds of boxwood,4 a s t i -chairs5 of boxwood, tables of boxwood, (all) inlaid with ivory, also 200 young females (clad in) linen garments with multicolored trimmings6 made of dark and reddish purple(dyed) wool, (also) alabaster, elephants' tusks (and even) a shining chariot (and) a golden nimattu -chair7 with panels8—his (own) royal insignia. I took over the chariot (-corps), the cavalry (and) the infantry of Carchemish. The kings of all (surrounding) countries came to me, embraced my feet and I took hostages from them and they marched (with me) towards the Lebanon (Lab-na-na) forming my vanguard.
1 This translation is based upon the variants a m "wild bull," and d i n g i r "(image of a) god," describing the very same object, cf. for these variants, L. W. King, AKA, 1, 366, n.3. 2 The words harttu and narmabfu refer to the two containers needed in the Orient for washing and taking a bath: a spouted vessel to pour the water and a recipient with wide opening to collect it. cf. the corresponding Egyptian word hsmn. 8 Literally: "furniture of his palace"; the term ckallu denotes in Mesopotamia the personal property of the king. * The reading tas\arinnu (instead of *ur\ar'tnnu) was indicated to me by Dr. B. Landsberger, who made reference to syllabic spellings in OldAssyrian and texts from Nuzi as well as to Aram, 'elhrd "boxwood." 5 The Sumerian words a S t i o r a g t e denote a special type of chair, often a royal throne. 6 This refers to linen garments decorated with sewn-on narrow woven bands or tresses made of wool thread in various colors (termed birmu). This typically Syrian technique is often depicted on Egyptian murals and reliefs. The Assyrian kings mention these garments always in their reports on booty or tribute received from Upper Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. 7 A certain type of easy chair. 8 For the technical terms ihzu "frame, border, mounting" and tamltl "panel, filling," cf. e.g., F.

I departed from Carchemish, taking the road between the mountains Munzigani and the Hamurga, leaving the country Ahanu on my left. I advanced towards the town Hazazu which belongs to Lubarna from Hattina. (There) I received gold and linen garments. I proceeded and crossed the river Apre9 (where) I passed the night. From the banks of the Apre I departed and advanced towards the town Kunulua, the royal residence of Lubarna from Hattina. Afraid of the terrible weapons of my ferocious army, he embraced my feet to save his life. Twenty talents of silver (the equivalent10 of) one talent of gold, 100 talents of tin, 100 talents of iron, 1,000 (heads of big) cattle, 10,000 sheep, 1,000 linen garments with multicolored trimmings, easy chairs of boxwood with insets (and) mountings, beds of boxwood, beds provided with insets, tables with ivory(inlay) (on) boxwood—(all) his own furniture, the weights of which were not taken (separately), also female singers (with) [numerous kan\ . . . ], large pagiitu -instruments11 (and) great EN-objects I received from him as his tribute, and himself I pardoned.

At that time I received (also) the tribute of Gusi from Iahani (consisting of): gold, silver, tin, [iron], large and small cattle, linen garments with multicolored trimmings. From Kunulua, the royal residence of Lubarna from Hattina, I departed; I crossed the river Orontes ([Aran]tu) and passed the night on the banks of the Orontes. From the banks of the Orontes I departed, taking the road between the mountains Iaraqi and Ia'turi, and crossed over the [ . . . ] mountain to pass (the night)12 on the banks of the Sangura river. From the banks of the Sangura river I departed, taking the road between the mountains Saratini and Duppani, and (passed the night)12 on the banks of the . . . [la]ke. I entered Aribua, the fortress of Lubarna from Hattina, and seized (it) as my own (town). I harvested the grain as well as the straw18 of the Luhuti country and stored (them) therein. In his own palace I performed the taliltu -festival14 and (then) settled natives of Assyria in it (the town). While I stayed in Aribua, I conquered the (other) towns of Luhuti, defeating their (inhabitants) in many bloody battles. I destroyed (them), tore down (the walls) and burned (the towns) with fire; I caught the survivors and impaled (them) on stakes in front of their towns.

(ii 78—102)
In the year of (the eponym) Daian-Ashur, in the month Aiaru, the 14th day, I departed from Nineveh. I crossed the Tigris and approached the towns of Giammu on the river Balih. They became afraid of the terror emanating from my position as overlord, as well as of the splendor of my fierce weapons, and killed their master7 Giammu with their own weapons. I entered the towns Sahlala and Til-sha-Turahi and brought my gods/images into his palaces. I performed the taltltu -festival in his (own) palaces. I opened (his) treasury, inspected what he had hidden; I carried away as booty his possessions, bringing (them) to my town Ashur. From Sahlala I departed and approached Kar-Shalmaneser. I crossed the Euphrates another time at its flood on rafts (made buoyant by means) of (inflated) goatskins. In Ina-Ashur-utir-asbat, which the people of Hattina call Pitru, on the other side of the Euphrates, on the river Sagur, I received tribute from the kings of the other side of the Euphrates—that is, of Sanagara from Carchemish, Kundashpi from Commagene, of Arame, man of Gusi, of Lalli from Melitene (Mclid), of Haiani, son of Gabari, of Kalparuda from Hattina, (and) of Kalparuda of Gurgum—(consisting of): silver, gold, tin, copper (or bronze), copper containers. I departed from the banks of the Euphrates and approached Aleppo (Hal-man). They (i.e., the inhabitants of A . ) were afraid to fight and seized my feet (in submission). I received silver and gold as their tribute and offered sacrifices before the Adad of Aleppo. I departed from Aleppo and approached the two towns of Irhuleni from Hamath (Amat). I captured the towns Adennu, Barga (and) Argana his royal residence. I removed from them his booty (as well as) his personal (lit.: of his palaces) possessions. I set his palaces afire. I departed from Argana and approached Karkara. I destroyed, tore down and burned down Karkara, his (text: my) royal residence. He brought along to help him 1,200 chariots, 1,200 cavalrymen, 20,000 foot soldiers of Adad-'idri (i.e. Hadadezer) of Damascus (Imerilu),*
T The use of the Sumerian term e n in this context is rather puzzling. It might indicate a peculiar social set-up which compelled the Assyrian scribes to use this rare word. 8 The problem of the often changing (and apparently interchangeable) Akkadian denominations for Damascus (apart from Di-ma( -a)l-qi/u) is still unsolved; for previous discussions I refer to A. T. Clay in YOS, i ( 1 9 1 5 ) , 2, n . i ; Streck, Assurbanipal (= VAB, v i i ) , in, 780, where literature is amply quoted. These denominations are Sa-imeriiu, Sa-imerePl-lu, Sa-i-me-ri-iu (cf., e.g., C. Bezold, Catalogue, 1, 2 1 ) and Imerelu with imeru spelled either phonetically or respectively as a n $ e and d u r . I would like to draw attention, on one hand, to the name of a town Sa-i-me-ri-e on the stela of Shilhak-Inshushinak ( V . Scheil, Delegation en Perse, Memoires, xi [ 1 9 1 1 ], 42, No. 1 4 ) , also attested in texts from Nuzi (cf. R. H. Pfeiffer and E. A. L&cheman, Miscellaneous Texts from Nuzi, HSS, xm [ 1 9 4 2 ] , No. 433:6 [road leading from Nuzi to Sa-imeri]), and, on the other hand, to certain Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian nouns (of the formation amel la xxx-su) denoting traders in commodities (salt, wine, pottery, fruit, etc.) or animals (for the latter, cf. C. H. W. Johns, Assyrian Deeds and Documents [London, 1898 f-l- 1076 11:2 amelsa bu-li-!u). cf. also the name of the town Sa-biresu (Forrer, Provinzeinteilung, p. 1 0 7 ) .

I slew 14,000 of their soldiers with the sword, descending upon them like Adad when he makes a rainstorm pour down. I spread their corpses (everywhere), filling the entire plain with their widely scattered (fleeing) soldiers. During the battle I made their blood flow down the hur-pa-lu of the district. The plain was too small to let (all) their (text: his) souls descend10 (into the nether world), the vast field11 gave out (when it came) to bury them.

In the sixth year of my rule, I departed from Nineveh and approached the river Balih. [The country] became afraid of my powerful army and [they killed] Giammu [their "master"]. I entered Til-Turahi and seized that town for myself. From the region along the river Balih I departed, the river Euphrates I crossed at its flood. I received tribute from the kings of the Hittite country (matHat-ti). From the Hittite country I departed and approached the town Aleppo (Hal-man). I made sheep[ofTering to the god Adad] of Aleppo.

9 Here, the name Musru refers probably to a country in southern Asia Minor (cf. H. Winckler, Arabisches Musri in MVAG, xi [ 1 9 0 6 ] , 102-116, and E. F. Weidner [apud H. Bauer] in AfO, vm [ 1 9 3 2 - 3 ] , 4, n.3, as well as recently in AfO, xiv ( 1 9 4 1 ) , 45, for three, or even more, countries bearing this name). The basic meaning of Musru is always "march" (from masaru "to mark, draw a line"), i.e. "border country." 10 Text: ana ium-pul ume*-!u(nu) (line n o ) . This expression seems to indicate that the "souls" of the numerous dying soldiers were conceived as slipping down to the nether world through holes or cavities in the ground and that the massed corpses actually did cover the battlefield so completely as to make this descent difficult. 11 The word naprarA (equated with seru in a list of synonymous Akkadian words, (cf. von Soden, ZA, X L I I I [ N F I X ] , 234, I.25) is to be derived from the stem prr* which has the same meaning as sprr (cf. A. Heidel, AS, No. 13 [ 1 9 4 0 ] ) , i.e. "to spread." 12 Read a d ( d a ) , i.e. lu + u g « . For the sign and its reading, cf. A. Goetze, JAOS, LXV ( 1 9 4 5 ) , 2 3 1 .

Hadadezer (AAdad-id-ri) of Damascus (matlrnerilu), Irhuleni of Hamath with 12 kings from the seacoast, trusting their combined power, set out (to march) against me for a decisive battle. I fought with them. I slew in battle 25,000 of their experienced soldiers and took away from them their chariots, their cavalry-horses and their battle equipment—they (themselves) dispersed to save their lives.
I embarked upon boats and made a journey into the high sea.

I crossed the Euphrates at its flood. I received tribute from [all] the kings of Hatti. At that time Hadadezer [of] Damascus, Irhulina from Hamath, as well as the kings of Hatti and (of) the seashore put their trust on their mutual strength and rose against me to fight a decisive battle.

Property of Adad-nirari, great king, legitimate king, king of the world, king of Assyria—a king whom Ashur, the king of the Igigi (i.e. the dei superi) had chosen (already) when he was a youngster, entrusting him with the position of a prince without rival, (a king) whose shepherding they made as agreeable to the people of Assyria as (is the smell of) the Plant of Life, (a king) whose throne they established firmly; the holy high priest (and) tireless caretaker of the temple e. s a r. r a , who keeps up the rites of the sanctuary, who acts (only) upon the trust-inspiring oracles (given) by Ashur, his lord; who has made submit to his feet the princes within the four rims of the earth; conquering from the Siluna mountain of the Rising Sun, the countries Saban, Ellipi, Harhar, Araziash, Mesu, the (country of the) Medians, Gizilbunda in its (full) extent, the countries Munna, Persia (Farsua), Allabria, Apdadana, Na'iri with all its regions, Andiu which lies far away in the pithu of the mountains1 with all its regions, as far as the Great Sea of the Rising Sun (and) from the banks of the Euphrates, the country of the Hittites, Amurru-country in its full extent, Tyre, Sidon, Israel (maiHu-um-ri), Edom, Palestine (Pa4a-as-tu), as far as the shore of the Great Sea of the Setting Sun, I made them submit all to my feet, imposing upon them tribute. ^ I marched against the country Sa-imerilu: I shut up Mari',2 king of Damascus (Imeriiu) in Damascus (Dima-al-qi), his royal residence.

In the fifth year (of my official rule) I sat down solemnly on my royal throne and called up the country (for war). I ordered the numerous army of Assyria to march against Palestine (Pa-la-äs-tü). I crossed the Euphrates at its flood. As to the numerous hostile kings who had rebelled in the time of my father ShamshiAdad (i.e., Shamshi-Adad V) and had withheld] their regular (tributes), [the terror-inspiring glam]or overwhelmed them (and) upon the command of Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad (and) Ishtar, my trust (-inspiring) gods, they seized my feet (in submission). I received all the tributes [ . . . ] which they brought to Assyria. I (then) ordered [to march] against the country Damascus (Sa-imerilu). I invested Mari' in Damascus (Dimal-qi) [and he surrendered]. One hundred talents of gold (corresponding to) one thousand talents of [silver], 60 talents of . . . [I received as his tribute].

I lifted my hands (in prayer) to my lord Ashur (with the result that) I (quickly) made him, and also his family, surrender (lit.: come out) (of Carchemish), (all) in fetters and with the gold, silver and his personal possessions. And the rebellious inhabitants of Carchemish who (had sided) with him, I led away as prisoners and brought (them) to Assyria. I formed from among them a contingent of 50 chariots, 200 men on horseback (and) 3,000 foot soldiers and added (it) to my royal corps. In the city of Carchemish I (then) settled inhabitants of Assyria and imposed upon their (neck) the yoke of Ashur, my lord."

G. R. Driver and J. C. Miles, The Assyrian Laws ( O x f o r d , 1935), p. 485 (with references); further, W. F. Albright, BASOR, 63 ( 1 9 3 4 ) , 29 f.; I.

The present reference to the "Yoke of Ashur" could therefore indicate a special status of the Assyrians forcibly setded in Carchemish.

Upon a trust(-inspiring oracle given by) my lord Ashur, I crushed the tribes of Tamud, Ibadidi, Marsimanu, and Haiapa, the Arabs who live, far away, in the desert (and) who know neither overseers nor official(s) and who had not (yet) brought their tribute to any king. I deported their survivors and settled (them) in Samaria. From Pir'u, the king of Musru, Samsi, the queen of Arabia, It'amra, the Sabaean,—the(se) are the kings of the seashore and from the desert—I received as their presents, gold in the form of dust, precious stones, ivory, ebony-seeds,10 all kinds of aromatic substances, horses (and) camels.

Azuri, king of Ashdod, had schemed not to deliver tribute (any more) and sent messages (full) of hostilities against Assyria to the kings (living) in his neighborhood. On account of the misdeed which he (thus) committed, I abolished his rule over the inhabitants of his country and made Ahimiti, his younger11 brother, king over them. But the(se) Hittites, (always) planning treachery, hated his (i.e. Ahimiti's) reign and elevated to rule over them a Greek12 who, without claim to the throne, knew, just as they (themselves), no respect for authority. [In a sudden rage] I marched quickly—(even) in my state-chariot13 and (only) with my cavalry which never, even in friendly territory,14 leaves my side—against Ashdod, his royal residence, and I besieged and conquered the cities Ashdod, Gath (Gi-im-tu) (and) Asdudimmu. I declared the gods residing therein, himself, as well as the inhabitants of his country, the gold, silver (and) his personal possessions as booty. I reorganized (the administration of) these cities15 and placed an officer of mine as governor over them and declared them Assyrian citizens and they bore (as such) my yoke.16

On account of the(se) act(s) which he committed, I abolished his rule over the people of his country and made Ahimiti, his younger brother, king over them. But the(se) Hittites, always planning evil deeds, hated his reign and elevated to rule over them a Greek (Ja-ma-ni) who, without any claim to the throne, had no respect for authority—just as they themselves. In a sudden rage, I did not (wait to) assemble the full might of my army (or to) prepare the camp(ing equipment), but started out towards Ashdod (only) with those of my warriors who, even in friendly areas, never leave my side. But this Greek heard about the advance of my expedition, from afar, and he fled into the territory of Musru—which belongs (now) to Ethiopia —and his (hiding) place could not be detected. I besieged (and) conquered the cities Ashdod, Gath, Asdudimmu; I declared his images, his wife, his children, all the possessions and treasures of his palace as well as the inhabitants of his country as booty. I reorganized (the administration of) these cities (and) settled therein people from the [regions] of the East which I had conquered personally. I installed an officer of mine over them and declared them Assyrian citizens and they pulled (as such) the straps (of my yoke). The king of Ethiopia who [lives] in [a distant country], in an inapproachable region, the road [to which is . . . ], whose fathers never—from remote days until now"—had sent messengers to inquire after the health of my royal forefathers, he did hear, even (that) far away, of the might of Ashur, Nebo (and) Marduk. The awe-inspiring glamor of my kingship blinded him and terror overcame him. He threw him (i.e. the Greek) in fetters, shackles and iron bands, and they brought him to Assyria, a long journey.

In my third campaign I marched against Hatti. Luli, king of Sidon, whom the terror-inspiring glamor of my lordship had overwhelmed, fled far overseas and perished.2 The awe-inspiring splendor of the "Weapon" of Ashur, my lord, overwhelmed his strong cities (such as) Great Sidon, Little Sidon, Bit-Zitti, Zaribtu, Mahalliba, Ushu (i.e. the mainland settlement of Tyre), Akzib (and) Akko, (all) his fortress cities, walled (and well) provided with feed and water for his garrisons, and they bowed in submission to my feet. I installed Ethba'al (Tuba'lu) upon the throne to be their king and imposed upon him tribute (due) to me (as his) overlord (to be paid) annually without interruption. As to all the kings of Amurru—Menahem (Mi-inhi-im-mu) from Samsimuruna, Tuba'lu from Sidon, Abdili'ti from Arvad, Urumilki from Byblos, Mitinti from Ashdod, Buduili from Beth-Ammon, Kammusunadbi from Moab (and) Aiarammu from Edom, they brought sumptuous gifts (igisA) and—fourfold—their heavy tdmartu -presents to me and kissed my feet. Sidqia, however, king of Ashkelon, who did not bow to my yoke, I deported and sent to Assyria, his familygods, himself, his wife, his children, his brothers, all the male descendants of his family. I set Sharruludari, son of Rukibtu, their former king, over the inhabitants of Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and of) katrii -presents (due) to me (as) overlordand he (now) pulls the straps (of my yoke)! In the continuation of my campaign I besieged BethDagon, Joppa, Banai-Barqa, Azuru, cities belonging to Sidqia who did not bow to my feet quickly (enough); I conquered (them) and carried their spoils away. The officials, the patricians and the (common) people of Ekron3—who had thrown Padi, their king, into fetters (because he was) loyal to (his) solemn oath (sworn) by the god Ashur, and had handed him over
to Hezekiah, the Jew (Ha-za-qi-(i)a-u amelIa-4-da-ai)(and) he (Hezekiah) held him in prison, unlawfully, as if he (Padi) be an enemy—had become afraid and had called (for help) upon the kings of Egypt (Mus(u)ri) (and) the bowmen, the chariot(-corps) and the cavalry of the king of Ethiopia (Meluhha), an army beyond counting—and they (actually) had come to their assistance. In the plain of Eltekeh (Al-ta-qu-4), their battle lines were drawn up against me and they sharpened their weapons. Upon a trust (-inspiring) oracle (given) by Ashur, my lord, I fought with them and inflicted a defeat upon them. In the melee of the battle, I personally captured alive the Egyptian charioteers with the(ir) princes and (also) the charioteers of the king of

Ethiopia. I besieged Eltekeh (and) Timnah (Ta-amna-a), conquered (them) and carried their spoils away. I assaulted Ekron and killed the officials and patricians who had committed the crime and hung their bodies on poles surrounding the city. The (common) citizens who were guilty of minor crimes, I considered prisoners of war. The rest of them, those who were not accused of crimes and misbehavior, I released. I made Padi, their king, come from Jerusalem (Ur-sa4i-im-mu) and set him as their lord on the throne, imposing upon him the tribute (due) to me (as) overlord. As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities, walled forts and to the coundess small villages in their vicinity, and conquered (them) by means of well-stamped (earth-)ramps, and battering-rams brought (thus) near (to the walls) (combined with) the attack by foot soldiers, (using) mines, breeches as well as sapper work. I drove out (of them) 200,150 people, young and old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, big and small cattle beyond counting, and considered (them) booty. Himself I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage. I surrounded him with earthwork in order to molest those who were leaving his city's gate. His towns which I had plundered, I took away from his country and gave them (over) to Mitinti, king of Ashdod, Padi, king of Ekron, and Sillibel, king of Gaza. Thus I reduced his country, but I still increased the tribute and the \atr& -presents (due) to me (as his) overlord which I imposed (later) jipon him beyond the former tribute, to be delivered annually. Hezekiah himself, whom the terror-inspiring splendor of my lordship had overwhelmed and whose irregular* and elite troops which he had brought into Jerusalem, his royal residence, in order to strengthen (it), had deserted him, did send me, later, to Nineveh, my lordly city, together with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, precious stones, antimony,5 large cuts of red stone, couches (inlaid) with ivory, nimedu -chairs (inlaid) with ivory, elephant-hides, ebony-wood, boxwood (and) all kinds of valuable treasures, his (own) daughters, concubines, male and female musicians. In order to deliver the tribute and to do obeisance as a slave he sent his (personal) messenger.

Property of Esarhaddon, great king, legitimate king, king of the world, king of Assyria, regent of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four rims (of the earth), the true shepherd, favorite of the great gods, whom Ashur, Shamash, Bel and Nebo, the Ishtar of Nineveh (and) the Ishtar of Arbela have pronounced king of Assyria (ever) since he was a youngster. I was (indeed) the(ir) youngest (brother) among my elder brothers, (but) my own father, upon the command of Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Bel and Nebo, the Ishtar of Nineveh (and) the Ishtar of Arbela, has chosen me—in due form and in the presence (lit.: assembly) of all my brothers—saying: "This is the son to (be elevated to) the position of a successor of mine." (Then) he put this question before Shamash and Adad by means of an oracle and they answered him: "He (verily) is your replacement."1 He (i.e. Sennacherib) heeded their important pronouncement and called together the people of Assyria, young and old, my brothers (and all) the male2 descendants of (the family of) my father and made them take a solemn oath in the presence of (the images of) the gods of Assyria: Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Nebo (and) Marduk, (and) of (all) the (other) gods residing in heaven and in the nether world, in order to secure my succession. In a propitious month, on a favorable day, I happily entered—upon their exalted (oracle-) command—the palace of the crown prince, this highly venerable place in which (those) live (who are) destined for the kingship. (When) the real meaning (of this act) dawned upon my brothers, they abandoned godliness, put their trust on bold actions, planning an evil plot. They originated against me slander, false accusation, (whatever is) disliked by the gods, and constantly were spreading evil, incorrect and hostile (rumors) behind my back. (Thus) they alienated from me—against the will of the gods—the heart of my father which was (formerly) friendly, (though) in the bottom of his heart there was (always) love (for me) and his intentions were (always) that I should become king. I became apprehensive and asked myself as follows: "Are their bold actions based upon trust in their own ideas3 or could they have acted (that) evil against the will of the gods?" I implored Ashur, the king of the gods (and) the merciful Marduk, to (both of) whom baseness is an abomination, by means of prayers, lamentations and prostrations, and they (eventually) agreed to (give) the (oracle-)answer (that the brothers acted) according

to the decision of the great gods, my lords. And they (the gods) made me stay in a hiding place in the face of (these) evil machinations, spreading their sweet protecting shadow over me and (thus) preserving me for the kingship. Thereupon, my brothers went out of their senses, doing everything that is wicked in (the eyes of) the gods and mankind, and (continued) their evil machinations. They (even) drew weapons in the midst of Nineveh (which is) against (the will of) the gods, and butted each other—like kids—to take over the kingship. Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Bel, Nebo, the Ishtar of Nineveh (and) the Ishtar of Arbela looked with displeasure upon these doings of the usurpers which had come to pass against the will of the gods, and they did not help them. (On the contrary) they changed their strength into weakness and (thus) made them (eventually) bow beneath me. (Also) the people of Assyria which had sworn the oath of the great gods, by means of water and oil, to protect my claim to the kingship, did not come to their assistance. But I, Esarhaddon, who never turns around in a battle, trusting in the great gods, his lords, soon heard of these sorry happenings and I cried out "Woe!" rent my princely robe and began to lament loudly. I became as mad as a lion, my soul was aflame and I (called up the gods by) clapping my hands, with regard to my (intention of) assuming the kingship, my paternal legacy. I prayed to Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Bel, Nebo and Nergal, (to) the Ishtar of Nineveh, the Ishtar of Arbela, and they agreed to give an (oracle-) answer. By means of their correct (and) positive answer, they sent me the (following) trustworthy oracle (received by) extispicy: "Go (ahead), do not tarry! We will march with you, kill your enemies!" I did not even wait for the next day,* nor for my army, did not turn back (for a moment), did not muster the contingents of horses broken to the yoke or the battle equipment, I did not (even) pile up provisions for my expedition, I was not afraid of the snow and the cold of the month Shabatu (in which) the winter is (at its) hard (est)—but I spread my wings like the (swift-)flying storm(bird) to overwhelm my enemies. I followed that road to Nineveh which is difficult for traveling but short. In front of me, in the territory of Hanigalbat, all their (i.e. the brothers') best soldiers blocked the advance of my expeditionary corps, sharpening their weapons (for the battle). But the terror (-inspiring sight) of the great gods, my lords, overwhelmed them and they turned into madmen when they saw the attack of my strong battle array. Ishtar, the Lady of Battle, who likes me (to be) her high priest, stood at my side breaking their bows, scattering their orderly battle array. And then they spoke among themselves: "This is our king!" Upon her lofty command they went over in masses to me and rallied behind me. Like lambs they gamboled and (recognized) me as their lord by praying (to me). The people of

Assyria which had sworn an oath by the life of the great gods on my behalf, came to meet me and kissed my feet. But they, the usurpers, who had started the rebellion, deserted their (most) trustworthy troops, when they heard the approach of my expeditionary corps and fled to an unknown country. I reached the embankment of the Tigris and upon the (oracle-) command of Sin and Shamash, the (two) lords of the (celestial) embankment, I had all my troops jump over the Tigris as if it be a small ditch.

In the month of Addar, a favorable month, on the 8th day, the day of the Nebo festival, I entered joyfully into Nineveh, the town in which I (exercise) my lordship and sat down happily upon the throne of my father. The Southwind, the breeze (directed by) Ea, blew (at this moment), this wind, the blowing of which portends well for exercising kingship, came just in time for me. (Other) favorable omina on the sky and on earth (which to interpret is) the work of the seer, messages of the gods and goddesses, happened continuously to me and made my heart confident. The culpable military which had schemed to secure the sovereignty of Assyria for my brothers, I considered guilty as a collective group and meted out a grievous punishment to them; I (even) exterminated their male descendants.

I caught out of the open sea, like a fish, Abdimilkutte, its king, who had fled before my attack into the high sea, and I cut off his head.

Abdimilkutte, king of Sidon, without respect for my position as lord, without listening to my personal orders, threw off the yoke of the god Ashur, trusting the heaving sea (to protect him). As to Sidon, his fortress town, which lies in the midst of the sea, I leveled it as (if) an abtibu -storm (had passed over it), its walls and foundations I tore out and threw (them) into the sea destroying (thus) its emplacement completely. I caught Abdimilkutte, its king, who fled before my attack into the sea, upon an oracle-command of Ashur, my lord, like a fish on high sea and cut off his head. I carried off as booty: his wife, his children, the personnel of his palace, gold, silver, (other) valuables, precious stones, garments made of multicolored trimmings and linen, elephant-hides, ivory, ebony and boxwood, whatever precious objects there were in his palace, (and) in great quantities. I led to Assyria his teeming subjects, which could not be counted, (and) large and small cattle and donkeys in great quantities.

Afterwards, Wahb (Uabu) induced all the Arabs to revolt against lata', (because) he wanted to become king (himself), but I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, king of the four rims (of the earth), who loves justice and to whom crookedness is an abomination, sent my army to the assistance of lata', and they subdued all the Arabs. They threw Wahb and the warriors of his entourage in fetters and brought them (to me). I put collars on them and bound them to the posts of my gate.

In the course of my campaign I threw up earthwork (for a siege) against Ba'lu, king of Tyre who had put his trust upon his friend Tirhakah (TarqA), king of Nubia (Kusu), and (therefore) had thrown off the yoke of Ashur, my lord, answering (my admonitions with) insolence. I withheld from them (i.e. the inhabitants of besieged Tyre) food and (fresh) water which sustain life.

Everywhere in Egypt, I appointed new (local) kings, governors, officers (la\nu), harbor overseers, officials and administrative personnel. I installed regular sacrificial dues for Ashur and the (other) great gods, my lords, for all times. I imposed upon them tribute due to me (as their) overlord, (to be paid) annually without ceasing.

(i 53—ii 94)
In my first campaign I marched against Egypt (Magan) and Ethiopia (Meluhha). Tirhakah ( T a r q u ) , king of Egypt (Musur) and Nubia (Kusu), whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, my own father, had defeated and in whose country he (Esarhaddon) had ruled, this (same) Tirhakah forgot2 the might of Ashur, Ishtar and the (other) great gods, my lords, and put his trust upon his own power. He turned against the kings (and) regents whom my own father had appointed in Egypt.3 He entered and took residence in Memphis (Me-im-pi), the city which my own father had conquered and incorporated into Assyrian territory. An express messenger came to Nineveh to report to me. I became very angry on account of these happenings, my soul was aflame. I lifted my hands, prayed to Ashur and to the Assyrian Ishtar. (Then) I called up my mighty armed forces which Ashur and Ishtar have entrusted to me and took the shortest (lit.: straight) road to Egypt (Musur) and Nubia. During my march (to Egypt) 22 kings from the seashore, the islands and the mainland,
A list of these kings is contained in the text of Cylinder C, composed of various fragments by M. Streck, opxit., pp. 139 ff. Translation: Luckenbill, AR, 11, §876.

Pappa, Erisu, king of Sillu, Damasu, king of Kuri, Admesu, king of Tamesu, Damusu, king of Qarti-hadasti, Unasagusu, king of Lidir, Pususu, king of Nure, together 12 kings from the seashore, the islands and the mainland;
servants who belong to me, brought heavy gifts (tdmartu) to me and kissed my feet. I made these kings accompany my army over the land—as well as (over) the sea-route with their armed forces and their ships (respectively). Quickly I advanced as far as Kar-Baniti to bring speedy relief to the kings and regents in Egypt, servants who belong to me. Tirhakah, king of Egypt (Musur) and Nubia, heard in Memphis of the coming of my expedition and he called up his warriors for a decisive battle against me. Upon a trust (-inspiring) oracle (given) by Ashur, Bel, Nebo, the great gods, my lords, who (always) march at my side, I defeated the battle (-experienced) soldiers of his army in a great open battle. Tirhakah heard in Memphis of the defeat of his army (and) the (terror-inspiring) splendor of Ashur and Ishtar blinded (lit.: overwhelmed) him (thus) that he became like a madman. The glamor of my kingship with which the gods of heaven and nether world have endowed me, dazzled him and he left Memphis and fled, to save his life, into the town Ni' (Thebes).5 This town (too) I seized and led my army into it to repose (there). Necho (Ni-\u-u), king of Memphis and Sais (Sa-a-a),* Sharruludari, king of Si'nu, Pishanhuru, king of Nathu, Pakruru, king of (Pi)shaptu, Bukkunanni'pi, king of Athribis (Ha-at-hi-ri-bi), Nahke, king of Hininshi, Putubishti, king of Tanis ($a-'-nu), Unamunu, king of Nathu, Harsiaeshu, king of Sabnuti, Buaima, king of Pitinti, Shishak (Su-si-in-qu), king of Busiris (Bu-H-ru), Tabnahti, king of Punubu, Bukkananni'pi king of Ahni, Iptihardeshu, king of Pihattihurunpi(ki), Nahtihuruansini, king of Pishabdi'a, Bukurninip, king of Pahnuti, Siha, king of Siut (Si-ia-a-ti-tu), Lamentu, king of Himuni (Hermopolis), Ishpimatu, king of Taini, Mantimanhe, king of Thebes; these kings, governors and regents whom my own father had appointed in Egypt and who had left their offices in the face of the uprising of Tirhakah and had scattered into the open country, I reinstalled in their offices and in their (former) seats of office. (Thus) I seized anew (control over) Egypt (Musur) and Nubia which (already) my own father had conquered; I made the garrisons stronger than before and the(ir) regulations (more) severe. With many prisoners and heavy booty I returned safely to Nineveh. Afterwards, (however), all the kings whom I had appointed broke the oaths (sworn to) me, did not keep the agreements sworn by the great gods, forgot that I had treated them mildly and conceived an evil (plot). They talked about rebellion and came, among them

selves to the unholy decision: " ( N o w when even) Tirhakah has been 'driven out of Egypt (Musur), how can we, ourselves, (hope to) stay?" And they sent their mounted messengers to Tirhakah, king of Nubia, to establish a sworn agreement: "Let there be peace between us and let us come to mutual understanding; we will divide the country between us, no foreigner shall be ruler among us!" They continued to scheme against the Assyrian army, the forces (upon which) my rule (was based), (and) which I had stationed (in Egypt) for their (own) support. (But) my officers heard about these matters, seized their mounted messengers with their messages and (thus) learned about their rebellious doings. They arrested these kings and put their hands and feet in iron cuffs and fetters. The (consequences of the broken) oaths (sworn) by Ashur, the king of the gods, befell them, I called to account those who had sinned against the oath (sworn by) the great gods (and those) whom I had treated (before) with clemency. And they (the officers)7 put to the sword the inhabitants, young and old, of the towns of Sais, Pindidi, («)
Tanis and of all the other towns which had associated with them to plot, they did not spare anybody among (them). They hung their corpses from stakes, flayed their skins and covered (with them) the wall of the town(s). Those kings who had repeatedly schemed, they brought alive to me to Nineveh. From all of them, I had only mercy upon Necho and granted him life. I made (a treaty) with him (protected by) oaths which greatly surpassed (those of the former treaty). I clad him in a garment with multicolored trimmings, placed a golden chain on him (as the) insigne of his kingship,8 put golden rings on his hands; I wrote my name (phonetically)9 upon an iron dagger (to be worn in) the girdle, the mounting of which was golden, and gave it to him. I presented him (furthermore) with chariots, horses and mules as means of transportation (befitting) his position as ruler. I sent with him (and) for his assistance, officers of mine as governors. I returned to him Sais as residence (the place) where my own father had appointed him king. Nabushezibanni, his son, I appointed for Athribis (thus) treating him with more friendliness and favor than my own father did. The terror of the (sacred) weapon of Ashur, my lord, overcame Tirhakah where he had taken refuge and he was never heard of again.10 Afterwards URdamane,11 son of Shabaku (var.: son of his sister), sat down on the throne of his kingdom. He made Thebes

and Heliopolis (jO-nu) his fortresses and assembled his (armed) might. He called up his battle (-experienced soldiers) to attack my troops, (and) the Assyrians stationed in Memphis. He surrounded these men and seized (all) their communications (lit.: exits). An express messenger came to Nineveh and told me about this. In my second campaign I marched directly against Egypt (Musur) and Nubia. U R d a m a n e heard of the approach of my expedition (only when) I had (already) set foot on Egyptian territory. He left Memphis and fled into Thebes to save his life. The kings, governors, and regents whom I had installed in Egypt came to meet me and kissed my feet. I followed U R d a m a n e (and) went as far as Thebes, his fortress. He saw my mighty battle array approaching, left Thebes and fled to Kipkipi. Upon a trust (-inspiring) oracle of Ashur and Ishtar I, myself, conquered this town completely. From Thebes121 carried away booty, heavy and beyond counting: silver, gold, precious stones, his entire personal possessions, linen garments with multicolored trimmings, fine horses, (certain) inhabitants, male and female. I pulled two high obelisks, cast13 of shining zahalu -bronze," the weight of which was 2,500 talents, standing at the door of the temple, out of their bases and took (them) to Assyria. (Thus) I carried off from Thebes heavy booty, beyond counting. I made Egypt (Musur) and Nubia feel my weapons bitterly and celebrated my triumph. With full hands and safely, I returned to Nineveh, the city (where I exercise) my rule.
In my third campaign I marched against Ba'il, king of Tyre, who lives (on an island) amidst the sea, because he did not heed my royal order, did not listen to my personal (lit.: of my lips) commands. I surrounded him with redoubts, seized his communications (lit.: roads) on sea and land. I (thus) intercepted (lit.: strangled) and made scarce their food supply and forced them to submit to my yoke. He brought his own daughter and the daughters of his brothers before me to do menial services.15 At the same time, he brought his son Iahimilki who had not (yet) crossed the sea to greet me as (my) slave. I received from him his
12 The text published by E. Nassouhi, AfO, n (1924), 97 ff., shows the following variant (Col. 11:7-10): "I conquered the town Thebes, the capital of Egypt (Mu-sir) and Nubia (Ku-Ii); I carried away as booty fine horses, linen garments with multicolored trimmings, gold, silver, and countless people." 13 T h e term pitqu ("cast") is used here incorrectly because the Egyptian obelisks had only metal coatings. 14 Zahalu (cf. also, Weissbach, WVDOG, LIX, 78, n.9) denotes a bright gold-copper alloy used—like a kindred alloy called esmaru—for casting objects and, at least in one instance (cf. D. D. Luckenbill, Annals of Sennacherib, 109:21), to provide a copper statue with a coating. 15 T h e Sumerian word a g r i g ( A k k . abaratyu) seems to refer originally to a servant (male or female) of higher standing within the retinue of a man of rank, perhaps a steward (Landsberger, AfO, x [1935-36], 150, n.48, and apud Stamm, MVAG, XLIV [1938], 270, n . i ) . In the NeoAssyrian period, it denoted a court official of consequence, while—in the present context—the term abaratyutu refers to the status of those daughters of vanquished foreign rulers who were admitted to the royal Assyrian household. While, on one hand, they might have been hostages, much like the sons and brothers of such unhappy kings, admitted to court service, their legal status was certainly different as is indicated by the fact that they are endowed with dowries.

daughter and the daughters of his brothers with their great dowries. I had mercy upon him and returned to him the son, the offspring of his loins. Iakinlu, king of Arvad, living (also) on an island who had not submitted to (any of) the kings of my family, did (now) submit to my yoke and brought his daughter with a great dowry to Nineveh to do menial services, and he kissed my feet.
(Lines 68-80 deal with kings of Asia Minor bringing tribute, etc.)
After Iakinlu, king of Arvad, had perished,18 Aziba'l, Abiba'l, Aduniba'l, Sapatiba'l, Budiba'l, Ba'liashupu, Ba'lhanunu, Ba'lmaluku, Abimilki, Ahimilki, the sons of Iakinlu who live (on an island) amidst the sea, came from the sea to me with their heavy presents (tdmartu) and kissed my feet. I liked Aziba'l (lit.: I looked with pleasure upon Aziba'l) and made him king of Arvad. I clad Abiba'l, Aduniba'l, Sapatiba'l, Budiba'l, Ba'liashupu, Ba'lhanunu, Ba'lmaluku, Abimilki (and) Ahimilki in multicolored garments, put golden rings on their hands and made them do service at my court.17

He thought little of the might of Ashur, my lord, and put his trust in his own power; the harsh way in which my own father had treated him, did not come to his mind. He marched out and entered Memphis, taking this town for himself. He sent l^is army against the Assyrians who were in Egypt, servants belonging to me, whom Esarhaddon, my own father, had appointed there as kings, to kill, to make prisoners and booty. An express-messenger came to Nineveh to report to me. I became very angry on account of these happenings, my soul was aflame. I called the turtan -official, the governors, and also their assistants and gave immediately the order to my mighty (batde-) forces for quick assistance to the kings and governors, servants who belong to me, and made them start out on the march to Egypt. In mad haste they marched on as far as the town Kar-Baniti.
(Lines 15-19 parallel the above translated report.) He (i.e. Tarqti) left Memphis, his royal residence, the place in which he had put his trust, to save his life, boarded a ship, leaving his camp and fleeing alone. He entered Thebes (Ni'). The warriors (of Assyria) seized all the warships that were with him. They sent me the good tiding through a messenger (who) also reported to me orally. (Then) I ordered to add to my former (battle-)forces (in Egypt) the rabSaq -officer, all the governors (and) kings of (the region) beyond the river (Euphrates), servants who belong to me, together with their forces and their ships, and (also) the kings of Egypt, servants who belong to me, together with their forces and their ships, to chase Tirhakah out of Egypt (Musur) and Nubia. They marched towards Thebes, the fortress-town of Tirhakah, king of Nubia, (covering) a distance of a month march (in) 10 days. Tirhakah, who had heard of the coming of my army, left Thebes, his fortress-town, crossed the Nile (la-ru-'-iiy and pitched camp on the other side (of the river). Necho, Sharruludari (and) Pakruru, kings whom my own father had installed in Egypt, did not keep the agreements sworn by Ashur and the great gods, my lords, they broke their oaths, forgot the friendliness (with which) my own father (had treated them) and began to plot.

my officers heard of these matters and met their cunning with cunning. They arrested their mounted messengers together with their messages and learned (thus) about their rebellious plot. They arrested Sharruludari (and) Necho.

He did leave me, Ashurbanipal, the holy high priest, the (ever)praying servant (of the gods), created by the hands of Ashur, and lent (lit.: gave) his armed forces to Abiiate' (and) Aamu, son of Te'ri. He ordered (them) expressly to the assistance of my evil brother Shamashshumukin.

Upon the oracle-command of Ashur, and Ishtar (I called up) my army and defeated him in bloody battles, inflicted countless routs on him (to wit) in the girti2 of the towns of Azaril (and) Hirata(-)kasaia, in Edom, in the pass of Iabrudu, in Beth-Ammon, in the district of Haurina, in Moab, in Sa'arri, in Harge, in the district of Zobah.3 In the(se) battles I smashed all the inhabitants of Arabia who had revolted with him, but he himself escaped before the powerful "weapons" of Ashur to a distant region. They set fire to the tents in which they live and burnt (them) down. Uate' had misgivings4 and he fled, alone, to the country Nabate.

[Iaujta' . . . [fled] to the country Nabaiati. [He went] to see Natnu (and) Natnu said as follows to Iauta': "(How) can I be saved (now) from Assyria (since) you have put me (by your visit) in your power!" Natnu was afraid, he was seized with anxiety and sent his messengers to inquire after my health and they kissed my feet. He implored me repeatedly—as his lordto make a peace agreement (secured by) oaths (and) to become my servant. (Finally) I looked with friendliness upon him, turning to him a smiling face. I imposed upon him an annual tribute.

As to (that other) Uate', the son of Hazail, the nephew of Uate', the son of Bir-Dadda who had made himself king of Arabia, Ashur, the king of the gods, the Great Mountain, made him change his mind and he came to meet me (in submission). To demonstrate that Ashur and the great gods, my lords (are worthy of) the (highest) praise, I imposed (the following) heavy punishment (var.: he accepted the (following) verdict): I put a pillory (on) his (neck) together with a bear (and) a dog and made him stand on guard (duty) at the gate in Nineveh, (called) Nirib-masnaqti-adnati * Ammuladi, however, king of Qedar (Qi-id-ri) rose to fight the kings of the Westland whom Ashur, Ishtar and the (other) great gods, have given me as my property.

(v 26—30)
(As to) Adia, queen of Arabia, I inflicted a bloody defeat upon her, burnt down her tents, seized her alive (and) removed her, with many (other) prisoners, to Assyria.
Upon the (oracle-) command of the great gods, my lords, I put a dog's collar on him and made him watch the bar (of the city's gate). Upon the (oracle-)command of Ashur, Ishtar and the great gods, my lords, I defeated in a bloody battle and routed the soldiers of Abiate' (and of) Aamu, son of Te'ri, who marched to the assistance of Shamashshumukin, my evil brother, (when they were about) to enter Babylon. The remainders who succeeded to enter Babylon ate (there) each other's flesh in their ravenous hunger, and (later) they made a sortie from Babylon to save their lives. My forces, (however,) stationed (there) against Shamashshumukin, inflicted a second defeat upon him (so that) he (i.e. Abiate') escaped alone and seized my feet to save his own life. I had mercy upon him, made him take oaths by the life of the great gods, appointing him, instead of Uate', son of Hazail,8 as king of Arabia.
A more explicit version appears in the Cylinder B (cf. M. Streck, opxit., pp. 135 ff.). Translation: Luckenbill, AR, 11, §870.
(viii 24—44)
Abiate', son of Te'ri, came to Nineveh and kissed my feet. I made a sworn agreement with him concerning his status as a servant of mine. I made him king instead of Iauta' (or) of somebody else. I imposed upon him as annual tribute gold, eye-shaped beads of UD.A$-stone, antimony, camels and studdonkeys. With the help of Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad, Bel, Nebo, the Ishtar of Nineveh—the Queen of Kidmuri—the Ishtar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal (and) Nusku and by pronouncing my name which Ashur has made powerful, Kamashaltu, king of Moab, a servant belonging to me, inflicted a defeat in an open batde upon Ammuladi, king of Qedar who, like him (Abiate'), had revolted and had continuously made razzias against the kings of the Westland. Ammuladi (himself) captured those of his (i.e. Abiate's) people who [escaped] before . . . , put them in handcuffs and iron foot fetters and sent them to me to Nineveh.
But he came to an understanding with the country of the Nabaiateans, was not afraid of the (oaths sworn by the) life of the great gods and made constantly razzias into the territory of my country. Natnu, king of Nabaiati which lies at a great distance and to whom Uate' had fled, heard—through an intervention7 of Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad, Bel, Nebo, the Ishtar of

Nineveh—the Queen of Kidmuri—the Ishtar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal (and) Nusku—about the might of Ashur which endows me with strength, and he—who had never sent a messenger to my royal forefathers to greet them as kings by inquiring after their healthinquired (now)—afraid of the (ever) victorious arms of Ashur—very assiduously8 after my royal health. But Abiate', son of Te'ri, devoid of any good intentions, unmindful of oaths sworn (even) by the great gods, spoke of rebellion against me and came to an understanding with Natni, king of Nabaiati; they called up their forces for a dangerous attack against my territory.
Upon an (oracle-) command of Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad, Bel, Nebo, the Ishtar of Nineveh—the Queen of Kidmuri—the Ishtar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal (and) Nusku, I called up my army and took the direct road against Abiate'. They (i.e. my army) crossed safely Tigris and Euphrates at the time of their highest flood; they took (lit.: followed) a path (leading to) far-away regions. They ascended high mountain chains, winding9 their way through woods full of shadow, proceeding safely upon a thorny road between high trees and sidrt -shrubs (full) of spines. A distance of 100 double-hours from Nineveh, the town beloved by Ishtar, the spouse of Ellil, they marched forward through the desert where parching thirst is at home, where there are not even birds in the sky and wherein neither wild donkeys (nor) gazelles pasture, following Uate', king of Arabia, and Abiate' who marched with the forces of the country of the Nabaiateans. I departed from the town Hadata in the month of Simanu—the month of Sin, first-born son of Ellil and leader (of his brothers)—on the 25th day—(the day of) the procession of the Ladyof-Babylon, the most important among the great gods. I pitched camp in Laribda, a city with a wall of undressed stones,11 at the (last) water cisterns. My army drew water (there) for their drinking-supply and (then) marched forward to the regions of parching thirst, as far as Hurarina. I inflicted a defeat upon the Isamme', a confederation12 of (the worshipers of) the god Atarsamain, and of the Nabaiateans between the towns of Iarki and Azalla in a far-away desert where there are no wild animals and (where) not even the birds build their nests. I took as booty from them countless prisoners, donkeys, camels and small cattle. After my army had marched unopposed through a distance of 8 double-hours, they returned safely and drank (again) water in Azalla to quench their thirst. (Then) they marched forward as far as the town Qurasiti, a

and the Qedareans under Uate', son of Bir-Dadda and made them march (with me) on the road to Damascus (Di-mal-qa), (also) his gods, his mother, his sister, his wife, his family (distaff side) (and) ajji the other women18 of Qedar, the donkeys, camels and small cattle as many as I caught with the help of Ashur*and Ishtar, my lords. ^ In the month of Abu—the month of the Bow-Star, the mighty daughter of Sin—the third day—the day before (the festival) of Marduk, king of the gods—I departed from Damascus (Di-maZ-qa); I marched forward as far as Hulhuliti, a distance of 6 double-hours, in a single night. I caught the confederation of Abiate', son of Te'ri, (with) the Qedareans at the steep mountain Hukkurina and inflicted a defeat upon him, carrying (some) booty away from him. During the battle, according to the (oracle-) command (given) by Ashur and Ishtar, my lords, I myself caught Abiate' (and) Aammu, son of Te'ri, alive and fettered them with iron fetters on hands and feet. I brought them to Assyria together with the booty (collected) in their country. Those fugitives who escaped my onslaught occupied in their terror the mountain Hukkuruna (which is) a steep mountain peak. I ordered soldiers to stand on guard in the towns of Manhabbi, Apparu, Tenuquri, Zaiuran, Marqana, Sadaten, Enzikarme, Ta'na, Irrana, anywhere where there were cisterns or water in the springs, thus refusing them (the access to the) water (supply) which (alone) could keep them alive. I (thus) made water to be very rare for their lips, (and many) perished of parching thirst. The others slit open camels, their (only) means of transportation, drinking blood and filthy water against their thirst. None of those who ascended the mountain or entered (this region) to hide there, did escape; none was enough fleet of foot to get out of my hands. I caught them all myself in their hiding-places; countless people—male and female—donkeys, camels, large and small catde, I led as booty to Assyria. They filled up completely and to its entire extent all my land(s) which Ashur has given me. I formed flocks and distributed camels as if they be sheep, dividing (them) up to all inhabitants of Assyria. Camels were bought within my country for less than one shekel14 of silver on the market place. The female tavernkeeper received camels, even slaves as a "gift," the brewer for a hapu (full of beer), the gardener for a basket of fresh dates.15 Irra, the Warrior (i.e. pestilence) struck down Uate', as well as his army, who had not kept the oaths sworn to me and had fled before the onslaught of

Ashur, my lord,—had run away from them. Famine broke out among them and they ate the flesh of their children against their hunger. Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad, Bel, Nebo, the Ishtar of Nineveh—the Queen of Kidmuri—the Ishtar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal (and) Nusku (thus) inflicted quickly upon them (all) the curses written (down) in their sworn agreements. Even when the camel foals, the donkey foals,18 calves or lambs were suckling many times (lit.: 7 times) on the mother animals, they could not fill (lit.: satiate) their stomachs with milk.18" Whenever the inhabitants of Arabia asked each other: "On account of what have these calamities befallen Arabia?" (they answered themselves:) "Because we did not keep the solemn oaths (sworn by) Ashur, because we offended the friendliness of Ashurbanipal, the king, beloved by Ellil!" And (verily) Ninlil, the lordly Wild-Cow, the most heroic among the goddesses who rivals in rank (only) with Anu and Enlil, was butting my enemies with her mighty horns; the Ishtar who dwells in Arbela, clad in (divine) fire (and) carrying the melammu -headwear, was raining flames upon Arabia; Irra, the Warrior, armed with anuntu,17 was crushing (underfoot) my foes; Ninurta, the Arrow, the great hero, the son of Ellil, was cutting the throats of my enemies with his sharp point; Nusku, the obedient messenger (of the gods) proclaimer of my lordship, who accompanied me upon the command of Ashur, (and) the courageous Ninlil, the Lady of [Arbela],18 who protected me as king, took the lead of my army and threw down my foes. (When) the troops of Uate' heard the approach of the(se) mighty "weapons" of Ashur and Ishtar, the great gods, my lords, which during the battle had come to my assistance, they revolted against him. He became frightened and left the house (sanctuary) into which he had fled, so that I caught him personally according to the trustworthy oracle of Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad, Bel, Nebo, the Ishtar of Nineveh—the Queen of Kidmuri—the Ishtar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal (and) Nusku—and brought him to Assyria. Upon an oraclecommand of Ashur and Ninlil I pierced his cheeks with the sharp-edged spear, my personal weapon, by laying the very hands on him which I had received to conquer opposition against me; I put the ring to his jaw, placed a dog collar around his neck and made him guard the bar of the east gate of Nineveh which is called Nirib-masnaq-adndte. (Later) I had mercy upon him and granted him life in order to praise the glory of Ashur, Ishtar (and) the great gods, my lords.
16 The denomination of the donkey foal as suhiru is very rare and recurs, to my knowledge, only in the Middle-Assyrian text Ebeling, KAJ, No. 311:8-9 where male ( n i ti ) and female (si-ni-il-te) imersu-hi-ru are mentioned. 16a This situation is mentioned in nearly the same words in the curses of the Aramaic treaty studied by H. Bauer, Ein aramaischer Staatsvertrag aus dem 8. Jahr. v. Chr. in AfO, v m , p. n (to lines x + 2-5). 17 T h e difficult word anuntu (identified in lists of synonymous words with qablu and tahazu "batde") is used here in exactly the same context as tuquntu, in L. W. King, STC, 1, 222:12. 18 Dr. F. W. Geers indicated to me the parallel text BrM 1904-10-9,81 (cf. L. W. King, Supplement, p. 20, No. 1 1 7 ) which permits the filling of this gap.
On my return march, I conquered the town Ushu the emplacement of which is on the seacoast19 I killed those inhabitants of Ushu who did not obey their governors by refusing to deliver the tribute which they had to pay annually. I took to task those among them who were not submissive. Their images and the (surviving) people I led as booty to Assyria. I killed (also) those'inhabitants of Accho who were not submissive, hanging their corpses on poles which I placed around the city. The others I took to Assyria, formed a contingent (out of them) and added (it) to the large army which
(x) Ashur has presented to me. During the battle I seized personally Aamu, son of Te'ri (who) had sided with Abiate', his brother; I (had) him flayed in Nineveh, the town (where I exercise) my rule.

IAN HISTORICAL TEXTS 327
The Neo-Babylonian Empire
and its Successors
The historiographic literature of this period is represented by excerpts from four chronicles translated in the first part of this section. They cover—sometimes overlapping—the period from the first year of Esarhaddon to the seizure of Babylon by Cyrus. For the literary form and the political tendencies of these documents, reference should be made to the remarks of LandsbergerBauer, in ZA, xxxvu ( N F 111), 61-65. The second part contains historical inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar II and of Nabonidus which refer to conquests made in the West (Syria and Palestine), to the foreign policy of the Chaldean dynasty, and describe, in his own words, Nabonidus' rise to royal power. To illustrate the particular background of this ruler, the Eski-Harran inscription is given, a memorial for the mother of the usurper. The end of this dynasty is illustrated by the account given by Cyrus on his famous cylinder and by the poetic text known under the misleading tide of Persian Verse-Account of Nabonidus. Finally, the novel mood of the Persian domination is shown in one of the trilingual inscriptions of Xerxes and—to document the persistency of the literary tradition—an inscription of the Seleucid king Antiochus I, Soter, has been translated.
HISTORIOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTS
I. TEXT FROM THE FIRST YEAR OF BELIBNI TO THE ACCESSION YEAR OF SHAMASHSHUMUKIN
From the Babylonian Chronicle (British Museum 84-211,356 and 92, 502, last publication in CT, xxxiv, Pis. 46 ff.), translated by F. Delitzsch, Die babylonische Chroni^ (Abh. d. Phil. Hist. Klasse; Kgl. Saechs. A\. d. W. xxv/1 [1906], 8 ff.), and partly by Luckenbill, The Annals of Sennacherib ( O I P , 11), 158 ff.
(ii 23—iv 38)
First year of Belibni: Sennacherib destroyed (lit: broke) the towns Hirimma and Hararatum. Third year of Belibni: Sennacherib marched down to the country of Akkad and carried away the booty (made) in Akkad. They brought Belibni and his nobles in fetters to Assyria. Three years was Belibni king in Babylon. Sennacherib placed his son Ashurnadinshumi upon the throne in Babylon. First year of Ashurnadinshumi: Hallushu, the brother of Ishtarhundu, king of Elam, seized him (i.e. Ishtarhundu) and closed up the door (of his palace) in front of him.1 Eighteen years was Ishtarhundu king in Elam. Hallushu, his brother, sat himself on the throne, in Elam. Sixth year of Ashurnadinshumi: Sennacherib marched down to Elam, he destroyed (lit: broke) the towns Nagituni, Hilmi, Pillatum and Hupapanu, and carried their booty away. Afterwards, Hallushu, king of Elam, marched against the country of Akkad; towards the end of the (month) Tashritu, he entered Sippar and killed its inhabitants. (The image of) Shamash did (therefore) not leave the temple Ebarra (in the procession). Ashurnadinshumi was made a prisoner and brought to Elam. Six years was Ashurnadinshumi king in Babylon. The king of Elam placed Nergalushe

zib on the throne, in Babylon. He declared (a state of) h\ostilitie\s (against) Assyria. First year of Nergalushezib: In the month of Tammuz, the 16th day, Nergalushezib seized Nippur and (unintelligible).2 In the month of Tashritu, the ist day,
(iii)
the Assyrian army entered Uruk; they carried away as booty the gods of Uruk and its inhabitants. (Thus while) Nergalushezib went after thtf Elamites (to ask for help), they (i.e. the Assyrians) snatched the gods of Uruk and its inhabitants. In the month of Tashritu, the 7th day, he (Nergalushezib) made an attack against the Assyrian army, in the province of Nippur, but he was seized in open batde and brought to Assyria. One year and 6 months was Nergalushezib king in Babylon. In the month of Tashritu, the 26th day, his people made a rebellion against Hallushu, king of Elam, and they closed up the door (of the palace) in front of him and killed him. Six years was Hallushu king in Elam. Kudurru sat himself on the throne in Elam. Afterwards Sennacherib marched down to Elam and destroyed ( l i t : broke) (the country) from the land of Rishi as far as Bit-Burnaki, and carried away the booty thereof. Mushezib-Marduk sat himself on the throne in Babylon. First year of Mushezib-Marduk: In the month of Abu, the 8( ?)th day, Kudurru, king of Elam, was seized in a rebellion and killed. Ten months was Kudurru king in Elam. Menanu sat himself on the throne in Elam. In an unknown year, Menanu called up the armies of Elam and Akkad and made an attack against Assyria in the town of Halule. He (also) made a raid against Assyria. Fourth year of Mushezib-Marduk: In the month of Nisanu, the 15th day, Menanu, king of Elam, suffered a stroke, his mouth was paralyzed, he was unable to speak. In the month of Kislimu, the ist day, the city (i.e. Babylon) was seized, Mushezib-Marduk was made a prisoner and brought to Assyria. Four years was Mushezib-Marduk king in Babylon. In the month of Addaru, the 7th day, Menanu, king of Elam, died (lit.: "fate"). Four years [was] Menanu king in E[lam]. Hummahaldashu sat himself on the throne in Elam. For eight years there was no king in Babylon. In the month of Tammuz, the 3rd day, the gods of Uruk entered Uruk (again) f r o m . . . . In the month of Tashritu, the 23rd day, Hummahaldashu, king of Elam, was stricken at noon and [die]d at sun-set (of the same day). Eight years was Hummahaldashu king in Elam.

In the month Abu, the Assyrian army took up battle position1 in the town Qablinu and Nabopolassar marched upstream against them. In the month Abu, the 12th day, he made an attack against the soldiers of Assyria and they fell back before him. A great defeat was (thus) inflicted upon Assyria and they took many of them as prisoners. They (also) seized the Mannaeans who had come to their (i.e. the Assyrians') assistance and high officials of Assyria. The same day the town of Qablinu was captured. In the same month of Abu, the king of Akkad2 sent his soldiers against the towns Mane, Sahiru and Balihu3 and they took much booty from them and carried many of them as prisoners away. They (also) led their gods away. In the month Ululu, the king of Akkad and his army turned back and on his march he took the (inhabitants of the) town Hindanu and their gods to Babylon.

The king of Assyria and his soldiers pitched (camp) against the army of the king of Akkad which was (thus) [sh]ut up in Takritain and attacked them for 10 days but did not seize the town.

Weidner, Jojachin, König von Juda, in babylonischen Keilschrifttexten {Melanges syriens offerts ä Monsieur Rent Dussaud, 11 [Paris, 1939], 923935), has published a small group of texts excavated by the German expedition in Babylon and dating from the 10th to the 35th year of Nebuchadnezzar II. The tablets list deliveries of oil for the subsistence of individuals who are either prisoners of war or otherwise dependent upon the royal household. They are identified by name, profession, and/or nationality. The two tablets, so far published, also mention, beside Judeans, inhabitants of Ashkelon, Tyre, Byblos, Arvad, and, further, Egyptians, Medeans, Persians, Lydians, and Greeks.

(two or three lines missing) [Against Akkad] he (i.e. Sennacherib) had evil intentions, he thought out crimes [agai]nst the country (Babylon), [he had] no mercy for the inhabitants of the cofuntry]. With evil intentions against Babylon he let its sanctuaries fall in disrepair, disturbed1 the(ir) foundation outlines and let the cultic rites fall into oblivion. He (even) led the princely Marduk away and brought (him) into Ashur. (But) he acted (thus against the country only) according to the wrath(ful will) of the gods. The princely Marduk did not appease his anger, for 21 years he established his seat in Ashur. (But eventually) the time became full, the (predetermined) moment arrived, and the wrath of the king of the gods, the lord of lords calmed down; he remembered (again) Esagila and Babylon, his princely residence. (Therefore) he made his own son murder the king of Subartu (Assyria), he who (once) upon the wrath(ful command) of Marduk (himself) had brought about the downfall of the country. (two or three lines missing)
(ii2)
He (i.e. Marduk) provided him (i.e. the king of Babylon) with helpers, made him acquire a friend and caused the king of the Manda-hordes who has no rival, to bow to his orders in submission and to come to his assistance. (And) he (the king of the Manda-hordes) swept on like a flood storm, above and below, right and left, avenging Babylon in retaliation. The king of the Manda-hordes, without (religious) fear, demolished the sanctuaries of all the gods of Subartu (Assyria). He also demolished the towns within the territory of Akkad which had been hostile against the king of Akkad and had not come to his assistance (in his fight against Subartu). None of their cult (-centers) he omitted, laying waste their (sacred) towns worse than a flood storm. The king of Babylon, however, for whom this sacrilegious action of Marduk was horrible, did not raise his hand against the cult(-places) of any of the great gods, but let his hair unkempt,8 slept on the floor (to express his pious desperation).
(iii)
[The king of Akkad then rebuilt the temple of] those gods and [resto]red the [cu]lt of those whose sacred cities Marduk had expressly permitted to be resettled, and whose deserted ruin-hills—the (former) sanctuaries of the gods—he (Marduk) had put into his (Neriglissar's) hands. (Also) the Ishtar (Inanna) of Uruk, the exalted princess who (formerly) dwelt in a gold (-clad) cella (and on a chariot) to which were harnessed seven lions, whose cult the inhabitants of Uruk had
1 Lit.: "to blot out" (suh/fu). This seems to have been done to make it impossible to retrace the outlines of the original foundation-walls and therefore to rebuild the sanctuary.

In the same dream, when my royal predecessor Nebuchadnezzar and one attendant (appeared to me) standing on a chariot, the attendant said to Nebuchadnezzar: "Do speak to Nabonidus, that he should report to you the dream he has seen!" Nebuchadnezzar listened to him and said to me: "Tell me what good (signs) you have seen!"

She did present my cause favorably before Marduk, my lord, with regard to the lengthening of (my) life into future days and the overthrowing of all opposition.10 And the wrath of Marduk, my lord, did (eventually) calm down and—full of awe—I dared to praise him; (then) with fervent prayers I approached his sanctuary and (eventually) addressed my prayers to him (directly), telling him my very thoughts as follows: "If I am in reality a king who pleases your heart—and I am not

II This passage is very difficult; my translation is necessarily provisional, based upon the peculiar situation (Marduk as the natural protector of legitimacy versus Nabonidus as usurper troubled by his conscience). Exacdy as in the Eski-Harran Memorial, longevity is considered here a gift with which the deity endows her favorites among men. 12 The name of this temple or chapel must not be confused with that of the temple of the goddess Nin-Eanna in Babylon: e . k i . d u r u n .

17 This seems to be an allusion to the well-established Mesopotamian concept that it is the function of the temple to receive and to transmit the sacrifices to the deity which "lives" on them. 18 The meaning of the text seems to suggest this translation and the proposed interpretation—although no Mesopotamian parallels can be adduced to support it.

1 This word still remains obscure. From Neo-Babylonian legal texts, one may gather the following evidence: 1) Speleers, Recueil des inscriptions de VAsie anterieure, etc. (Bruxelles, 1925) 293:2,5,9 mentions a bit ku-ruup-pu ri\(?)-\i-tim which was rented; also Clay, Babylonian Records in the Library of J. Pierpont Morgan, 11, 1:1 where this type of house is described as adjacent to other bit \ttrupptis; and 2) the formula malihu la kuruppi is quite frequent in texts of this period, note also O. Kruckmann, Texte und Maierialien der Frdu Professor Hilprecht Babylonian Collection, 11/hi, 193:10 (context damaged) "silver (given) a-na ku-ru-up-pu-iu" and 3) R.

Ahuramazda is the great god who gave (us) this earth, who gave (us) that sky, who gave (us) mankind, who gave to his worshipers2 prosperity,* who made Xerxes, the king, (rule) the multitudes (as) only king, give alone orders to the other (kings).4 I am Xerxes, the great king, the only king (lit: king of kings), the king of (all) countries (which speak) all kinds of languages, the king of this (entire) big and far (-reaching) earth,—the son of king Darius, the Achaemenian, a Persian, son of a Persian, an Aryan (1ar-ri-i) of Aryan descent (lit.: seed)." Thus speaks king Xerxes: These are the countries—in addition to Persia—over which I am king under the "shadow" of Ahuramazda, over which I hold sway, which are bringing their tribute to me—whatever is commanded them by me, that they do and they abide by my law(s)—: Media, Elam, Arachosia, Urartu (Pers. version: Armenia), Drangiana, Parthia, (H)aria, Bactria, Sogdia, Chorasmia, Babylonia, Assyria, Sattagydia, Sardis, Egypt (Mi-fir), the Ionians who Eve on the salty sea and (those) who live beyond ( l i t : on the other shore of) the salty sea, Мака, Arabia, Gandara, India, Cappadocia, Da'an, the Amyrgian Cimmerians (Pers. and Elam. versions: Sakans), the Cimmerians (wearing) pointed caps, the Skudra, the Akupish, Libya,6 Banneshu (Carians) (and) Kush.
1 Dr. G. G. Cameron is to be thanked for his expert assistance in translating certain difficult passages of this text. 2 The Persian and Elamite versions do not differentiate between the term which the Akkadian version renders respectively as "mankind" (amelutu) and "worshipers" (nUe). 8 T h e Persian word is connected etymologically w i t h Latin quits (cf. also, Herzfeld, Akpersische Inschrijten, pp. 3 1 8 ff.), but refers there—as Dr. Cameron pointed out to me—to "earthly affairs." 4 T h i s renders the A k k . ma'dStu, the Persian text means literally: one of m a n y kings or framatars. e The Akk. text—unable to render the foreign concept—uses here a transliteration of the Old Persian original: ar-ri-i-si-tir for ar*yafitk^a. 8 cf. for this translation (of A k k . mPu-u-fu), G.

Thus speaks king Xerxes: After I became king, there were (some) among these countries (names of which) are written above, which revolted (but) I crushed (lit.: killed) these countries, after Ahuramazda had given me his support, under the "shadow" of Ahuramazda, and I put them (again) into their (former political) status. Furthermore, there were among these countries (some) which performed (religious) service (lit.: festival) to the "Evil (God)s," (but) under the "shadow" of Ahuramazda I destroyed (lit.: eradicated) these temples of the "Evil (God)s" and proclaimed (as follows) : "You must not perform (religious) service to the 'Evil (God)s' (any more)!" Wherever formerly (religious) service was performed to the "Evil (God)s," I, myself, performed a (religious) service to Ahuramazda and the arta (cosmic order)7 reverendy. Furthermore, there were other things which were done in a bad way, and these (too) I made in the correct way. All these things which I did, I performed under the "shadow" of Ahuramazda and Ahuramazda gave me his support until I had accomplished everything. Whosoever you are, in future (days) who thinks (as follows): "May I be prosperous in this life and blessed* after my death!"—do live according to this law which Ahuramazda has promulgated: "Perform (religious) service (only) for Ahuramazda and the arta (cosmic order) reverendy." A man who lives according to this law which Ahuramazda has promulgated, and (who) performs (religious) service (only) to Ahuramazda and the arta (cosmic order) reverently, will be prosperous while he is alive and—(when) dead—he will become blessed. Thus speaks king Xerxes: May Ahuramazda protect me, my family and these countries from all evil. This I do ask of Ahuramazda and this Ahuramazda may grant me!

And in the month of Addaru, the 20th day, the 43rd year (of the Seleucid era), I did lay the foundation of Ezida, the (only) true temple of Nebo which is in Borsippa.

May (only words of) favor be on your sacred lips (lit.: mouth) with regard to me, and may I personally conquer (all) the countries from sunrise to sunset, gather their tribute and bring it (home) for the perfection of Esagila and Ezida.

For the use of substitutes for clay when this common matter was to be touched by royal hands, I refer here to two misunderstood passages; Nabopolassar (text: ZA, 1v [1889], 129 S.t col. 111:2-3) reports: "I made my first-born son Nebuchadnezzar carry clay (which was in reality) a mixture of wine, oil, and resin-cuttings (p-it-tam be-el-la-at \ardni lamni u hi-bi-il-tim)," and Ashurbanipal (cf. E. Nassouhi, AfO, n [1924], 98, 1:17) refers to the same technique with the words "by means of a brickmould made of ebony and m e s -wood from Magan and (from) cuttings of aromatic matters (hi-bil-ti J i m . b i. a ), I made the (first) brick for it." 4 For this translation of larrutumi-Ia-ri, cf. my remarks above in n.i, p. 269b.

I, the Sun Suppiluliumas, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, the valiant, the favorite of the Stormgod, went to war. Because of king Tusratta's1 presumptuousness I crossed the Euphrates and invaded the country of Isuwa.2 The country of Isuwa I vanquished for the second time and made them again my subjects. The countries which in the time of my father (20) had crossed over into the country of Isuwa,* (namely) people from Gurtalissa, people from Arawanna, the country of Zazzisa, the country of Kalasma,4 the country of Tim(mi)na, the mountain district of Haliwa, the mountain district of Kama, people from Turmitta, the country of Alha, the country of Hurma, the mountain district of Harana, half of the country of Tegarama,5 people from Tepurziya, people from Hazga, people from Armatana—these peoples and these countries I vanquished, and reconquered them for the Hatti land. The countries which I captured I set free and they remained in their respective places; but all the people whom I set free, they returned to their people and the Hatti land took over their places.

I vanquished the country of Halba10 and the country of Mukis." Takuya, the king of Neya,12 came before me to the country of Mukis to sue for peace. But in Takuwa's absence, his brother Akit-Tessub persuaded the country of Neya and the city Neya to revolt Akit-Tessub entered into a conspiracy with the mariyannuTM (namely) Hismiya, Asiri, Zulkiya, Utriya and Niruwa. Together with their charioteers and their foot soldiers they entered into a conspiracy with Akiya, the king of Arahti. They occupied Arahti and rebelled; this is what they said: "Let us battle with the great king, the king of the Hatti land!" (35) I, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, vanquished them at Arahti. I took prisoner Akiya, the king of Arahti, Akit-Tessub, Akuwa's brother, and their mariyannu, all of them with all that they owned and brought them to the Hatti land. I also brought Qatna14 with its possessions and all that they owned to the Hatti land. When I proceeded to the Nuhasse land,151 conquered all its countries. Sarrupsi1" had met a violent death; I took prisoner his mother, his brothers and his sons and brought them to the Hatti land. Takib-sar, his servant, (40) I placed as king over Ukulzat. I proceeded to Apina17 without expecting that I would have to fight with the country of Kinza.18 However, Sutatarra together with Aitakama, his son, and together with his charioteers went out to fight with me. I defeated him and they retreated into Abzuya; I had Abzuya besieged. I took prisoner Sutatarra together with his son, his mariyannu, his brothers and with all that they owned and brought them to the Hatti land. I then proceeded to the country of Apina; Ariwanahi, the king of Apina, Wambadura, Akparu and Artaya, his great, went out to fight with me. (45) (I took prisoner) all of them with their countries and with all that they owned and brought them to the Hatti land.

(iii) While my father was down in the country of Karkamis,1 he dispatched Lupakkis and Tessub-zalmas to the country of Amqa.2 They proceeded to attack the country of Amqa and brought deportees, catde (and) sheep home before my father. (5) When the people of the land of Egypt heard about the attack on Amqa, they became frightened. Because, to make matters worse, their lord Bibhururiyas* had just died, the Egyptian queen who had become a widow, sent an envoy to my father (10) and wrote him as follows: "My husband died and I have no son. People say that you have many sons. If you were to send me one of your sons, he might become my husband. I am loath to take a servant of mine (15) and make him my husband." . . . When my father heard that, he called the great into council (saying): "Since of old such a thing has never happened before me" (20) He proceeded to dispatch Hattu-zitis, the chamberlain, (saying): " G o ! Bring you reliable information back to me. They may try to deceive me: As to whether perhaps they have a prince (25) bring reliable information back to me!"

while sending him to the land of Egypt as follows: "Perhaps they have a prince; they may try to deceive me and do not really want one of my sons to (take over) the kingship," the Egyptian queen answered my father in a letter as follows: "Why do you say: 'They may try to deceive me'? If I had a son, would I (iv) write to a foreign country in a manner which is humiliating to myself and to my country? You do not trust me and tell me even such a thing. (5) He who was my husband died and I have no sons. Shall I perhaps take one of my servants and make him my husband? I have not written to any other country, I have written (only) to you. (10) People say that you have many sons. Give me one of your sons and he is my husband and king in the land of Egypt." Because my father was generous, he complied with the lady's wishes and decided for (sending) the son.

Palestinian Inscriptions
TRANSLATOR: W. F. ALBRIGHT
The Gezer Calendar
This litde inscription was discovered at Gezer in 1908 by R. A. S. Macalister; it is on a school exercise tablet of soft limestone. For a number of years its date was uncertain, but recent discoveries establish its relative archaism and point to the second half of the tenth century or the very beginning of the ninth as its probable time. The writer would date it in or about the third quarter of the tenth century—about 925 B.C. in round numbers. The language is good biblical Hebrew, in a very early spelling; it is written in verse and seems to have been a kind of mnemonic ditty for children. The official publication will be found in Macalister, Gezer, 11, pp. 24-28, and hi, PI. cxxvit. For a nearly exhaustive bibliography up to 1934 see Diringer, Le iscrizioni antico-ebraiche Palestine si (Florence, 1934), pp. 1-20, supplemented by Albright, BASOR, 92, pp. 16-26. For subsequent bibliography and a full discussion see Sabatino Moscati, L'epigrafia ebraica antica 19351950 (Rome, 1951), pp. 8-26; see also A. M. Honeyman, JRAS,

His two months are (olive) harvest, (tricolon, 2:2:2) His two months are planting (grain), His two months are late planting; His month is hoeing up of flax, (tricolon, 3:3:3) His month is harvest of barley, His month is harvest and feasting; His two months are vine-tending, (bicolon, 2:2) His month is summer fruit.

This important inscription was discovered intact in 1868; it was subsequendy broken by the Arabs and in 1873 it was taken to the Louvre. The best publication is found in Dussaud, Les monuments palestiniens et judaiques (Musee du Louvre), 1912, pp. 4-22, with a magnificent photograph of the stela and a good bibliography. The work of Smend and Socin, Die Inschrift des Königs Mesa von Moab (1886), which was long standard, is not reliable, as was pointed out in detail by Renan and ClermontGanneau; see especially Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, 1, pp. 1-10. The most recent competent translation is that of Gressmann, AOT, pp. 440-42. On the question of the authenticity of the text, which was strangely disputed for a long time (in spite of the fact that no forger of that time could possibly have divined the correct forms of letters in the ninth century B.C.), cf. Albright, JQR, xxxv, 1945, pp. 247-250.
For details of translation which depend on recent discoveries see especially Poebel, Das appositionell bestimmte Pronomen (Chicago, 1932), pp. 7-11; Albright, BASOR, 89, p. 16. n.55. There are a number of words which were formerly obscure but which have now been found in other Northwest-Semitic inscriptions. The date of the Mesha Stone is roughly fixed by the reference to Mesha, king of Moab, in II Kings 3:4, after 849 B.C. How
ever, since the contents of the stela point to a date toward the end of the king's reign, it seems probable that it should be placed between 840 and 820, perhaps about 830 B.C. in round numbers.
I (am) Mesha, son of Chemosh-[... ], king of Moab, the Dibonite—my father (had) reigned over Moab thirty years, and I reigned after my father,—(who) made this high place for Chemosh in Qarhoh [ . . . ] because he saved me from all the kings and caused me to triumph over all my adversaries. As for Omri, (5) king of Israel, he humbled Moab many years (lit., days), for Chemosh was angry at his land. And his son followed him and he also said, "I will humble Moab." In my time he spoke (thus), but I have triumphed over him and over his house, while Israel hath perished for ever! (Now) Omri had occupied the land of Medeba, and (Israel) had dwelt there in his time and half the time of his son (Ahab), forty years; but Chemosh dwelt there in my time. And I built Baal-meon, making a reservoir in it, and I built (10) Qaryaten. Now the men of Gad had always dwelt in the land of Ataroth, and the king of Israel had built Ataroth for them; but I fought against the town and took it and slew all the people of the town as satiation (intoxication) for Chemosh and Moab. And I brought back from there Arel (or Oriel), its chieftain, dragging him before Chemosh in Kerioth, and I settled there men of Sharon and men of Maharith. And Chemosh said to me, "Go, take Nebo from Israel!" (15) So I went by night and fought against it from the break of dawn until noon, taking it and slaying all, seven thousand men, boys, women, girls and maid-servants, for I had devoted them to destruction for (the god) Ashtar-Chemosh. And I took from there the [ . . . ] of Yahweh, dragging them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel had built Jahaz, and he dwelt there while he was fighting against me, but Chemosh drove him out before me. And (20) I took from Moab two hundred men, all first class (warriors), and set them against Jahaz and took it in order to attach it to (the district of) Dibon.
It was I (who) built Qarhoh, the wall of the forests and the wall of the citadel; I also built its gates and I built its towers and I built the king's house, and I made both of its reservoirs for water inside the town. And there was no cistern inside the town at Qarhoh, so I said to all the people, "Let each of you make (25) a cistern for himself in his house!" And I cut beams for Qarhoh with Israelite captives. I built Aroer, and I made the highway in the Arnon (valley); I built Beth-bamoth, for it had been destroyed; I built Bezer

The Ostraca of Samaria
This name is applied to a homogeneous group of 63 dockets on Israelite potsherds which were found by G. A. Reisner in 1910, while excavating a floor-level from the first phase of the second period of palace construction at Samaria. Owing to a mistake in stratigraphy, which was subsequendy corrected by J. W. Crowfoot and his associates, this level was first attributed to Ahab; it is now reasonably certain that it should be assigned to the reign of Jeroboam II (about 786-746 B.C.). The four regnal years mentioned on the Ostraca extend from the ninth to the seventeenth (about 778-770 B.C.). These documents, though jejune in themselves, are of great significance for the script, spelling, personal names, topography, religion, administrative system, and clan distribution of the period. The documents were published first by G. A. Reisner in his rare book, Israelite Ostraca from Samaria (no date). A revised form of this study was then incorporated in the Harvard Excavations at Samaria, by Reisner, Fisher and Lyon (Cambridge, Mass., 1924), pp. 227-246. For a full bibliography up to 1933 see Diringer, Le iscrizioni antico-ebraiche palestinesi (Florence, 1934), pp. 21-68, especially pp. 66-68. Subsequent treatments deal mainly with the question of chronology or with the personal names; cf. especially J. W. Crowfoot, The Buildings at Samaria (London, 1942), pp. 5-9, 24-27; Albright, BASOR, 73, p. 21, n.38.

An Order for Barley from Samaria
In 1932 several ostraca were found at Samaria, and were published the following year by E. L. Sukenik. One of them is outstanding because of its length and relative completeness. The script belongs to the eighth century, probably to its third quarter; it is characterized by extraordinarily long shafts of such letters as I, m, n, like other Israelite documents of this general period. The text is difficult, and the rendering below is tentative. For the official publication see Sukenik, PEQ, 1933, pp. 152154; the text has subsequendy been treated by Diringer, Le iscrizioni antico-ebraiche palestinesi (Florence, 1934), pp. 71-72, and Albright, PEQ, 1936, pp. 211-15.

T h e Siloam Inscription
Accidentally discovered in 1880 in the rock wall of the lower entrance to the tunnel of Hezekiah south of the temple area in Jerusalem, the inscription is now in the Museum of the Ancient Orient at Istanbul. Its six lines occupy the lower half of a prepared surface, the upper part of which was found bare of inscription. It is, accordingly, almost certain that the first half of the original document is missing. Its contents and script point to the reign of Hezekiah (about 715-687 B.C.), a dating confirmed by II Kings 20:20 and especially II Chron. 32:30. There is a very extensive bibliography, which is collected up to 1932 by Diringer, Le iscrizioni antico-ebraiche palestinesi (Florence, 1934)« pp. 95-102. For later publications see Sabatino Moscati, L'epigrafia ebraica antica 1935-1950 (Rome, 1951) and Albright, JBL, 62, p. 370. The language is perfect classical Hebrew prose, but the spelling is not entirely consistent; translations can easily be judged by the quality of Hebrew which they presuppose.
[ . . . when] (the tunnel) was driven through. And this was the way in which it was cut through:—While [ . . . ] (were) still [ . . . ] axe(s), each man toward his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to be cut through, [there was heard] the voice of a man calling to his fellow, for there was an overlap in the rock on the right [and on the left]. And when the tunnel was driven through, the quarrymen hewed (the rock), each man toward his fellow, axe against axe; and the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1,200 cubits, and the height of the rock above the head(s) of the quarrymen was 100 cubits.
The Lachish Ostraca
These ostraca were discovered in the ruins of the latest Israelite occupation at Tell ed-Duweir in southern Palestine, which unquestionably represents biblical Lachish. The first 18 were found by the late J. L. Starkey in 1935; three more (making 21 in all) were added during a supplementary campaign in 1938. Most of the ostraca were letters, while others were lists of names, etc., but only a third of the documents are preserved well enough to be reasonably intelligible throughout. Nearly all of the ostraca come from the latest occupation level

of the Israelite gate-tower, and they are generally placed immediately before the beginning of the Chaldean siege of Lachish, perhaps in the autumn of 589 (or 588) B.C. Since they form the only known corpus of documents in classical Hebrew prose, they have unusual philological significance, quite aside from the light which they shed on the time of Jeremiah. The texts were published by Harry Torczyner of the Hebrew University in The Lachish Letters (Lachish I), (London, 1938), and Te'udot La\hish (Jerusalem, 1940). There is a large scattered bibliography, for which see Torczyner's second publication, pp. viii-x, and BASOR, 82, p. 18. Among the more useful items will be found Albright, BASOR, 61, pp. 10-16; 70, pp. 11-17; 73, pp. 16-21; 82, pp. 18-24; H. L.

IV. Rituals, Incantations, and Descriptions of Festivals






Egyptian Rituals and Incantations
TRANSLATOR: JOHN A. WILSON
A Ritual for Offering Food
The ancient Egyptian texts contain an abundance of material on the ritual to be performed in making offerings. The most common setting is the mortuary offering to the dead, in which the material offered is called "the Eye of Horns." The deceased was thought of as Osiris, and the servitor thus became his pious son Horus, who offered up his eye fighting on behalf of his father. The brief extract which follows is accompanied by the directions to the servitor for his manual acts. The passages come from the pyramids of Unis and Pepi I (Nefer-ka-Re) of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties (25th-24th centuries B.C.). Published by K . Sethe, Die altagyptischen Pyramidentexte (Leipzig, 1908), 1, §§6ic-63c.
Words to be spoken: "O Osiris King Nefer-ka-Re, take to thyself the Eye of Horus» Lift thou it to thy face." A lifting of bread and beer. Lifting before his face. Words to be spoken: "Lift thy face, O Osiris. Lift thy face, O this King Neferka-Re, whose state of glory has departedLift thy face, O this King Nefer-ka-Re, honored and keen, that thou mayest look at that which came forth from thee,2 . . . Wash thyself, O King Nefer-ka-Re. Open thy mouth with the Eye of Horus.8 Thou callest thy \a> like Osiris, that it may protect thee from all wrath of the dead.4 O King Nefer-ka-Re, receive thou this thy bread, which is the Eye of Horus." Laid on the ground before him.
The Daily Ritual in the Temple
The temple ceremonial on behalf of gods or deified pharaohs was elaborate and detailed. Brief extracts are here given of the ritual whereby Amon-Re of Karnak was awakened each morning and prepared for his daily activities. One episode has to do with the preliminary burning of incense, the other two with the opening of the shrine within which the god rested. The texts are from Berlin Papyrus 3055, facsimiled in Hieratische Papyrus aus den \oniglichen Museen zu Berlin, 1 (Leipzig, 1901), Pis. I-XXXVII. The manuscript comes from Thebes and dates to the Twenty-second Dynasty (ioth-pth centuries B . C . ) . It was treated by O. von Lemm, Das Ritualbuch des Amondienstes (Leipzig, 1882), and by A. Moret, he rituel du culte divin journalier en £gypte (Paris, 1902). For a similar ritual on behalf of the deified Amen-hotep I, related to scenes of offering in the temple of Karnak, see the study by H. H. Nelson in JNES, vm ( 1 9 4 9 ) , 201-232, 310-345*(See A d d e n d a ) .
1 Grammar uncertain, but not: whose glory is lost to him; rather: whose state of other-world being has departed (to the other w o r l d ) . 2 Probably some confusion of Osiris and Horus here, as the Eye came from Horus. Alternatively, the bread which was offered came forth from Osiris as god of the grain.
3 An elaborate ceremonial of "Opening the Mouth" was performed upon a statue of the deceased, in order to enable him to eat, drink, and speak. 4 It is clear that the \a could function to protect the deceased from the malignity of other dead, but the significance of the phrase "like Osiris" is not clear.
For a text which was used in the daily ritual of the temple, see p. 6 above.
(i 1 ) T H E BEGINNING OF THE UTTERANCES OF the sacred
rites which are carried out for the House of Amon-Re, King of the Gods, in the course of every day by the major priest who is in his day's (service).
T H E UTTERANCE FOR striking the fire. WORDS TO BE
SPOKEN: "Welcome, welcome in peace, O Eye of Horus,1 who art glorious, unharmed, and youthful in peace! It shines forth like Re upon the horizon. The power of Seth has hidden itself before the Eye of Horus, who took it away and brought it back, (so that) it is put in its place (again) for Horus. Triumphant is Horus because of his Eye.2 The Eye of Horus drives away enemies (5) [for] Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands, wherever they may be. An offering which the king gives: I am pure."8... (iii 5) . . . T H E UTTERANCE FOR breaking the clay.4 WORDS TO BE SPOKEN: " T h e clay is broken; the cool waters are opened; the veins of Osiris are drawn.51 have certainly not come to drive the god from his throne; I have come to put the god upon his throne. (Thus) thou abidest upon thy great throne, O Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands." I am one whom the gods inducted. An offering which the king gives: I am pure."
T H E UTTERANCE FOR loosening the shrine.7 WORDS TO
BE SPOKEN: "The finger of Seth is drawn out of the Eye of Horus, (so that) it may become well.8 The finger of Seth is loosed from the Eye of Horus, (so that) it may become well. The leather covering on the back of the god is laid off.9 O Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands, (iv 1) receive thou thy two feathers and thy white crown as the Eye of Horus, the right
1 The flame for the incense, like other offerings, was called the Eye of Horus. 2 ' T r u e is the voice of Horus because of his Eye," i.e. he triumphed in the legal contest against Seth. s Dogmatically the pharaoh was the priest of all the gods. Since it was impossible for him to fulfill this function, he delegated authority to priests, who were thus made pure for the designated activity. There follow this utterance the utterances for taking the censer, for laying the bowl of the censer upon its arm, for putting the incense upon the fire, and for proceeding to the shrine. 4 Breaking the clay sealing of the doors of the shrine. 5 The breaking of the clay is like the opening of an earthen dam in order to release irrigating waters. This, in turn, is likened to the opening of the veins of Osiris, god of the Nile waters. " T h e god, awakened from his night's sleep, must be assured that the priest has no hostile intention and is fit for his role. 7 A variant title in the daily ritual for the goddess Mut (Berlin Papyrus 3014,. ii 10, in the same publication) gives: " T H E UTTERANCE FOR THE
DRAWING BACK OF THE BOLT" (of the shrine d o o r ) .
8 The door-bolt of the shrine is likened to the finger of Seth with which he damaged the eye of Horus. When the finger was withdrawn, the eye might heal. 9 If the translation is correct, this must refer to a shroud which covered the image of the god by night.

(feather) as a right eye and the left as a left eye.10 Thou hast thy beauty, O Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands: naked, thou art covered; clothed, thou art (further) clothed. Now I am verily a priest; it was the king who sent me to see the god."11
Circumcision in Egypt
References to circumcision are rare in ancient Egypt. In the following text the man wishes to record the fact that he came successfully through that rite. T h e inscription should be studied in conjunction with a scene of circumcision mentioned in the notes to the translation. T h e stela probably comes from N a g a ed-Der in Middle E g y p t and is now at the University of Chicago, Oriental Institute 16956. It w a s published by D. D u n h a m , Naga-ed-Der Stelae of the First Intermediate Period ( L o n d o n , 1937), PI. XXXII, N o . 84, pp. 102-04. D u n h a m considers the stela to date from the early part of the First Intermediate Period (23rd century B.C.).
An offering which the king and Anubis, Who is Upon His Mountain, He Who is In Ut, the Lord of the Holy Land, give: an invocation-offering to the Count, Seal-Bearer of the King of Lower Egypt, Sole Companion, and Lector Priest, honored with the great god, the Lord of Heaven, Uha, who says: "I was one beloved of his father, favored of his mother, whom his brothers and sisters loved. When I was circumcised,1 together with one hundred and twenty men, there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, there was none (5) thereof who scratched, there was none thereof who was scratched.21 was a commoner of repute, who lived on his (own) property, plowed with (his own) span of oxen, and sailed in his (own) ship, and not through that which I had found in the possession of my father, the honored Uha."8
10 Confusing to the modern. T h e god's headdress consisted of a crown flanked with two feathers. Each feather was an "eye" and the composite headdress the "Eye." 11 cf. n.3 above. T h e sense may be: " T o be sure, I am (only) a priest, (but) it was the king w h o sent me to see the god."
1 As D u n h a m points out, this word tab may be connected with the Coptic word for "circumcise," tebbe or tebi. Further, it is probably the same word as the sebet attached as a legend to the scene referred to in the following note. ' D u n h a m suggests that these phrases may have referred to the circumcision ceremony or may have been general, that Uha in his career abused no one and was abused by no one. We have taken it as meaning that it was remarkable that so large a group should have been circumcised without injury to the youths or without any youth reacting violently. In support of that possibility, there may be cited the Sixth Dynasty scene at Sakkarah, in the tomb of Ankh-ma-Hor (J. Capart, Une rue de tombeaux h Saqqarah [Brussels, 1 8 9 7 ] , n, PL LXVI; W. Wreszinski, Atlas xur altagyptischen Kulturgeschichte, m [Leipzig, 1936-], 25-26). T h i s scene shows that the youth might fear the operation sufficiently so that he might have to be held firmly. T h e legend to the scene is "circumcision," the word being the one of n.i above, and its determinative suggesting that a flint knife was used. T h e operator is, interestingly enough, a "mortuary priest," who says to the attendant who is holding the youth: "Hold on to him; do not let him faint." The attendant answers: '1 shall act to thy pleasurel" In the neighboring scene the youth says to the operator "Rub off what is (there) thoroughly." The operator answers: "I shall make (it) heal." These passages indicate that the fear of pain was present. An interesting point in our inscription is the large number who were circumcised at one time. One might conclude that circumcision was effected periodically in a mass ceremony, rather than individually. * An expression of the independent spirit of the end of the Old Kingdom and the beginning of the Middle Kingdom.
AND INCANTATIONS
Charms Against Snakes
T h e fear of snakes and scorpions in the ground, of crocodiles in the water, and of lions in the desert was ever-present in ancient Egypt. For an example of a charm which might be used against snakes or scorpions, see pp. 12-14 above.1 Since the dead were buried in the ground, they also needed protection against the beasts of the ground, so that the mortuary texts in tombs provided adequate magic against snakes. T h e following charms come from the pyramids of pharaohs Unis, Teri, and Pepi I of the Fifth-Sixth Dynasties (25th-24th centuries B.C.) at Sakkarah. T h e y are published in K. Sethe,

Words to be spoken: "A face has fallen against a face; a face has seen a face.2 The mottled knife, black and green, goes forth against it. It has swallowed for itself that which it tasted."8
b
Words to be spoken: "This is the fingernail of Atum, which was on the backbone of Nehebu-kau and which brought to an end the strife in Hermopolis.4 Fall, roll up!"
c
Words to be spoken: "Back with thee, hidden snake! Hide thyself! Thou shalt not make King Unis see thee. Back with thee, hidden snake! Hide thyself! Thou shalt not come to the place where King Unis is, lest he tell that name of thine against thee: Nemi, the son of NemitThe servant of the Ennead fell into the Nile.8 Turn about, turn about! O monster, lie down!"
Curses and Threats
a
In the Sakkarah pyramid of the pharaoh Unis (25th century B.C.), the earth-god G e b is cited as the authority to restrain mortals from abusing the name of the deceased king. T h e text is in K. Sethe, Die altagyptischen Pyramidentexte ( L e i p z i g , 1908), 1, § § 1 3 7 - 3 8 ; translation in Sethe, Ueberzetsung und
1 For amuletic tablets of late times, used against stings or bites, cf. the article by K. C. Scele, Horus on the Crocodiles, in JNES, vi ( 1 9 4 7 ) , 435A·
2 The lurking snake is seen, so that hostile action may be taken against
it.
s We do not know the significance of the coloring of the knife which consumes the snake. Some mythological reference may be involved. 4 That which clamps the snake to the ground is likened to the finger (or toe) nail of the god Atum in a myth—otherwise unknown to us—in which he pinned d o w n the snake called Nehebu-kau and thus concluded some mythological quarrel in Hermopolis. The magical application of known myth to exorcism is obvious in these texts. 5 T h e knowledge of a hidden name of power and the ability to release that name and thus weaken the power are themes also of the text in pp. 34-36 above. The hidden name of the snake may be: "Wanderer, the son of Wanderess"; its application is not known. 4 Another mythological parallel of which the significance escapes us, although it is obvious that, as such a being fell into the Nile, the snake cannot escape. The rendering of the designation of the being is uncertain, perhaps: "the majesty of the shining one." At any rate, the texts determine the designation with the picture of a pelican, which—in myth—must have suffered such a fate.

Every god who will not build the staircase of this Meri-Re for him, when he goes up and when he ascends to heaven—he shall have no offering bread, he shall have no sunshade, he shall not wash himself in the basin, he shall not smell the joint of meat, he shall not taste the leg of meat, earth shall not be hacked up for him, offerings shall not be struck for him—when he goes up, when this Meri-Re ascends to heaven. It is not really this Pepi who says this against you, O gods; it is magic which says this against you, O gods.

The tomb was a man's "house of eternity," and violators of a tomb were threatened with an afterlife judgment or with the other-world vengeance of the deceased, who dwelt with the gods. The following text, from the Sakkarah tomb of the Sixth Dynasty magistrate Nenki (24th-23rd century B.C.), appears in K. Sethe, Urkunden des Alten Reichs {Ur\., 1, Leipzig, 1933), 260, and in A. H. Gardiner and K. Sethe, Egyptian Letters to the Dead (London, 1928), 10, PI. x, 1.
As for this tomb, which I have made in the necropolis of the West, I made it (in) a clean and central place. As for any noble, any official, or any man who shall rip out any stone or any brick from this tomb, I will be judged with him by the Great G o d , 1 1 (will) seize his neck like a bird, and I will cause all the living who are upon earth to be afraid of the spirits who are in the West, which is (still) far from them.

The following text, from the Sakkarah tomb of the Sixth Dynasty vizier Ankh-ma-Hor, is published in Sethe, op. cit., 201-02, and in Gardiner and Sethe, op. cit., 10, Pi. x, 2.
[May it go well with you], my successors; may it prosper you, my predecessors! As for anything which ye may do against this my tomb (of) the necropolis, [the like shall be done] against your property. I was a successful and knowing lector priest. No magic was ever effectively secret from me.8 [As for] all [people] who

But as for every man who may enter [into this tomb] being pure and satisfied with it, I will be his partisan in the necropolis, in the council of the Great God.

In addition to afterlife vengeance, perils upon earth might be invoked against an evildoer. The following text is from the Gizeh tomb of the Sixth Dynasty official Meni and is now in the Glyptothek at Munich. Published by Sethe, op. cit., 23, and by A . Scharff in MDIK, V I I I (1939), 17-33, p 1 · I 2 ·
The Eldest of the House Meni says: The crocodile be against him in the water, the snake be against him on land—(against) him who may do a thing to this (tomb). I never did a thing to him. It is the god who will judge (him).

The divine king of Egypt might—in effect—excommunicate any violators of a royal decree. The following text is a promise on behalf of the property of a vizier of the First Intermediate Period (23rd century B.C.). It was found in the Temple of Koptos and is now Cairo Museum 41894. Published by R. Weill, Les decrets royaux de I'ancien empire igypnen (Paris, 1912), 59-67, Pis. iv, ix, and by Sethe, op. cit., 304-06.
As to all people of this entire land who may do an injurious or evil thing to any statues, offering-stones, chapels, woodwork or monuments of thine which are in any temple precincts or any temples, my majesty does not permit that their property or that of their fathers remain with them, that they join the spirits in the necropolis, or that they remain among the living [upon earth].

In royal decrees the pharaoh might set mundane legal penalties against acts which could be established by evidence. However, where the evidence might be obscure, he could invoke divine vengeance. The following text is from a decree of Seti I (about 1318-1301 B.C.) at Nauri near the Third Cataract in the Sudan, and is on behalf of a temple of Osiris at Abydos. It was published by F. IJ. Griffith in JEA, xm (1927), 193-206, and translated by W. F. Edgerton in JNES, vi ( 1 9 4 7 ) , 219-30. This extract is from lines 109-19.

But as to any [magistrate] who is in any city, to [whom] shall come anybody of the House-of-Men-maatRe-Heart's-Ease-in-Abydos in order to make complaint to him—and he shall be deaf to him, in order not to fly at his word to do his business quickly—the law shall be carried out against him by beating him with one hundred blows, he being removed from his office and made a peasant-farmer in [the House-of]-Menmaat-Re-Heart's-Ease-in-Abydos.

By a nice application of magic, divine vengeance might be apportioned to a triad of gods. This text, from a temple of Seti I at Wadi Abbad east of Redesiyeh on the Nile, was last published by C. E. Sander-Hansen, Historische Inschriften der /9. Dynastie (ßibliotheca Aegyptiaca, iv, Brussels, 1933), 29; was translated by Breasted, AR, in, §194, and by B. Gunn and A. H. Gardiner in JEA, iv (1917), 248.
As to anyone who shall be deaf to this decree, Osiris shall be after him, Isis after his wife, and Horas after his children,8 and the great ones, the lords of the Holy Land, will make their reckoning with him.
Magical Protection for a Child
A brief extract will serve as an example of protective magic, in this case the mother protecting her sleeping child at night. Berlin Papyrus 3027, perhaps from the 16th century B.C., was published by A. Erman, Zaubersprüche für Mutter und Kind (APAW, 1901). The following extract, recto i 9-ii 6, is also in K. Sethe, Aegyptische Lesestücke (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1928), 51-52. There is a translation in G. Roeder, Urkunden zur Religion des alten Aegypten (Jena, 1923), 116-19.

7 Osiris, as the god of the temple, would act to preserve his property. 8 Similarly in a 20th dynasty tomb at Aniba in Nubia (G. Steindorff, Aniba [Glückstadt, 1 9 3 7 ] , PI. 101; Breasted, op. ext., iv, 5483): " A s to anyone who shall speak against it, Amon-Re, King of the Gods, shall be after (him) to destroy him, Mut shall be after his wife, and Khonsu after his child, (so that) he shall hunger, he shall thirst, he shall become weak, and he shall suffer."

The Execration
of Asiatic Princes
In the Middle Kingdom period the Egyptians practiced the magical cursing of their actual or potential enemies. In the Berlin Museum are fragments of pottery bowls which had been inscribed with the names of such foes and then smashed. In the Cairo and Brussels Museums inscribed figurines carry the same kind of curse. As they smashed such pottery, so they thought to break the power of their enemies. The exorcised elements were Nubians, Asiatics, Libyans, hostile Egyptians, and evil forces. The translation below, from the Berlin material, gives some Asiatics, some Egyptians, and the forces. The Berlin fragments were purchased in Thebes; the Cairo and Brussels fragments came from Sakkarah. The period was the latter part of the Twelfth Dynasty or the Thirteenth Dynasty (i9th-i8th centuries B.C.).1 The Berlin material was published by K. Sethe, Die Aechtung feindlicher Fürsten, Völker und Dinge . . . (APAW, 1926). The numbering below is that of Sethe. The figurines were published by G. Posener, Princes et pays d'Asie et de Nubie . . . (Brussels, 1940), with added remarks by B. van de Walle. Many of the identifications are still sub judice, with an extensive literature of comment and identification. We follow here S. H. Horn, The Relations between Egypt and Asia during the Egyptian Middle Kingdom (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Chicago, 1951), which takes account of the discussion up to 1951.

2 This may be either soothing the child, just as the spirit desired to kiss the child and thus gain its affection, or imposing the silence of death. 8 Some of the magic packet, which kept the spirits away, had known efficacy, here specifically stated. 4 Here the magic efficacy arises out of a pun: hedjw "onions," and hedjet " w h a t injures." 6 The dead.
1 Posener, op. ext., 31-35, believes that the figurines cannot be earlier than Sen-Usert III (about 1880-1840 B.C.), but may be later, and that the bowls may be slightly older. W. F. Edgerton, in JAOS, LX ( 1 9 4 0 ) , 492, n.44, states that the Berlin texts "cannot be earlier than Sesostris [= Sen-Usert] III and are more probably to be placed in the Second Intermediate Period." W. F. Albright, in BASOR, 88 ( 1 9 4 2 ) , 32, places the figurines in the mid-19th century B.C. 2 Many of the geographic names are unknown, and identifications for most of the others must be tentative. The present name has been related to the 'Anaqim "giants" w h o were in the land of Canaan at the time of the Conquest: e.g. Deut. 2:10. 8 Taken as the Egyptian word for "trusted men." Perhaps the same word as the *hani\ of Gen. 14:14; see the comments by T. O. Lambdin in JAOS,
LXXIII ( L 9 5 3 ) , 1 5 0 .

Religious Drama in Egypt
Much of Egyptian religious ceremonial was carried on in dramatic form. Priests and other initiated persons assumed roles and recited parts in a drama appropriate to a religious purpose. For the most part, such a use of the ceremonial texts is not stated; only occasionally is our evidence more explicit.1 T h e following Twelfth Dynasty text records the satisfaction of an official at his opportunity to take part in a passion play of Osiris at Abydos. T h e stela of Ii-kher-nofret was found at A b y d o s and is n o w 1204 in the Berlin Museum. It was published by H. Schäfer,
Die Mysterien des Osiris in Abydos unter König Sesostris III
( Untersuch., iv, L e i p z i g , 1904), a n d t h e text appears in K. Sethe, Aegyptische Lesestiic\e ( 2 n d ed., L e i p z i g , 1928), 70-71. T r a n s lated by Breasted, AR, 1, §§661-70.

Live the Horus: Divine of Form; the T w o Goddesses: Divine of Birth; the Horus of Gold: Who Comes into Being; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Khakau-Re; the Son of Re: Sen-Usert, given life like Re forever.2 Royal decree to the Hereditary Prince and Count, Seal-Bearer of the King of Lower Egypt, Sole Companion, Overseer of the T w o Houses of Gold, Overseer of the T w o Houses of Silver, and Chief Treasurer, Ii-kher-nofret, the possessor of reverence: "My majesty has commanded that thou be sent upstream to Abydos of the Thinite nome, to make monuments for my father Osiris, the Foremost of the Westerners, and to embellish his mysterious image with the fine gold which he caused my majesty to bring out of the land of Nubia in victory and in triumph. Now thou shalt do this in (5) the truest way to do a thing, . . . inasmuch as it is the case that thou hast had recourse to the teaching of my majesty—for thou didst really grow up as my majesty's ward, the sole pupil of my palace, and I made thee a courtier when thou wert a youth of twenty-six years. . . . Go thou, and return when thou hast acted according to all that my majesty has commanded."
(10) I acted according to all that his majesty commanded in accomplishing what my lord had commanded for his father Osiris, the Foremost of the Westerners, the Lord of Abydos, the great power residing in the Thinite nome. I acted as the "Son-Whom-He-Loves"3 for Osiris, the Foremost of the Westerners. I adorned his great barque of eternity and everlastingness. I made for him a port

The gods who attended him were fashioned, and their shrines were made anew. I laid [<a charge upon] the hour-priests of the temple to do their duties, and they were made to know the regulations for every day and the feasts of the beginnings of the seasons. I conducted the work on the neshmet-bzTque* and I fashioned the cabin. (15) I decked the breast of the Lord of Abydos with lapis lazuli and turquoise, fine gold, and all costly stones which are the ornaments of a god's body. I clothed the god with his regalia in my office of privy councilor and my duty of ritualist. I was pure of hand in decking the god, a sem-priest purified of fingers.

This ritual is known from four texts, designated below as A, B, C, and D; all four texts are transcribed and translated by F. Thureau-Dangin, Rituels accadiens (Paris, 1921), 10 ff. Text A, now in the Louvre, was copied in the Seleucid period in the city of Uruk; the latest copy is by F. Thureau-Dangin, TCL, vi, No. 44, the latest translation by E. Ebeling, AOT, 303 ff. Text B, now in Berlin, was excavated at Ashur, where it had been copied from older Babylonian texts in the seventh century B.C.; a copy of the text was published by E. Ebeling, KAR, 1, No. 60. Text C consists of two duplicate texts, in Berlin and London, the former excavated at Ashur and the latter at Nineveh, both having been copied in the seventh century B.C. from older tablets which came from Babylonia; one was published by E. Ebeling, KAR, 1, No. 50, the other by H. Zimmern, Beiträge zur Kenntnis der bab. Rel., Ritualtafeln N0. 56. Text D, from Nineveh, was published in Vol. iv of Rawlinson, N0. 1 of Plate 23; it is a copy of an older text which came from Babylonia.

Ritual for the Purification of
God and Man
Text: KUB, xxix, 7. Only the better-preserved parts, beginning with reverse 12, are translated here.
At nightfall they [ . . . ] and they w[ipe clean] the god. F[or the sake of the king] they treat him1 with herbs against words of blasphemy (and) curse. Also [for the sake] of the queen's implements [they treat him with herbs]. (15)[She2 hand]s a soda-plant to the one who holds the queen's implements during the ceremony and while doing so she speaks as follows: "If in the pr[esence of the god anyone, king or queen, has said in mal]ice: 'Let blasphemy and uncleanliness enter that temple (and) grow there like a soda-plant! Let it thrive (there) [like] a soda-[plant] so that it becomes abundant! Let no one be able [to uproot] the soda-plant!' (20) "Now look, [this is what has happ]ened: The god has [ . . . ] cut down that thriving (and) abundant soda-plant like a harvester, and then reduced it to ashes. Like that soda-plant let him also reduce to ashes and make into soap evil word, oath, cu[rse] (and) uncleanliness! So let it then no longer exist for my god; neither let it exist for the sacrificer's person! Let god and sacrificer be free (of them)! Just as he has re[duced] this soda-plant (25) [to ashes] and made it into soap, even so let evil word, oath, curse and uncl[eanliness] be made into soap! Let god and sacrificer be free of that matter!"
Afterward they hand to him an o[nion], and while this is being done, she speaks as follows: "If in the presence of the god anyone sp[eaks] as follows: 'Just as this onion consists of skins which are wrapped together, one being [un]able to get loose from another —as (in) an on [ion] let evil, oath, curse (and) uncleanliness be wrapped around that temple!' See now, (30) I have picked this onion apart and have [no]w left only one wretched stem. Even so let him3 pick apart evil word, oath, curse (and) uncleanliness from the god's [temple]! Let god and sacrificer be free of that matter!" After that they hand him a co[rd] which is twisted together toward the left. While this is being done, she speaks as follows: "If anyone has afflicted th[is] god

with evil word, oath, curse (35) and uncleanliness and has twisted them together like a cord, (if) it was . . . [ . . . ] twisted toward the left, I have it now untwisted toward the right. Let evil word, oa[th], curse and uncleanliness no longer exist for my god; neither let it exist for the sacrificer's person! Let god and sacrificer be free of that matter!" After that they make a basin in front of [the . . . ], and from the basin they build a [sma]ll ditch (40) leading to the river. Into it they put a boat lined with a little silver (and) gold. They also make small "oaths" and "curses" of silver (and) gold and place them into the boat. Then the ditch which empties the basin carries the ship from the basin into the river. When it disappears, she pours out a little fine oil and honey and while doing so speaks as follows: "Just as the river has carried away the ship (45) and no trace of it can be found any more—whoever has committed evil word, oath, curse and uncleanliness in the presence of the god—even so let the river carry them away! And just as no trace of the ship can be found any more, let evil word no longer exist for my god; neither let it exist for the sacrificer's person! Let god and sacrificer be free of that matter!"
"See! I have poured out fine oil and honey after them. The trail behind them (50) is anointed with fine oil and honey. Let the evil word be turned away (to places) beyond! Just as the river does not flow backward, even so let it carry away these evil words! Let them not come back!" After that the sacrificer lifts up a piece of silver three shekels in weight, and from a pitcher he pours water over that piece of silver three
shekels in weight. While this is being done, she4 speaks
as follows: "Whoever has spoken evil in the presence of the god, just as the dark earth (55) has swallowed up this water, even so let the earth swallow up that evil word! Let these words be free and unattached\ Let god and sacrificer be free of that matter!" As a substitute for the king he hands over one ox, and as a substitute for the queen's implements he hands over one cow, one ewe and one goat. While this is being done, she speaks as follows: "With whatever evil word, oath, curse (60) (and) uncleanliness the god was afflicted, let the substitutes carry them away from the god! Let god and sacrificer be free of that matter!" Afterward the sacrificer recites a hymn, (accompanying it) with (an offering consisting of) a small sacrificial loaf and a small cheese.

(ii) [She1 takes clay from the pit and ties it to the sacrificer. Thereafter we release it. She throws it into the hole which has been dug in the ground2 and speaks as follows: "Just as . .. brought up this clay] from the pit [and] is presenting [it to the sacrificer, even so let. . . bring up] this man's recovery [(and) vigor!]" She takes mud from the spring (5) and ties [it] to [the sacrificer]. Thereafter [we] release it. She throws it [into the hole] which has been dug in the ground and speaks as follows: "Just as [the spring brought] up this mud from the nether world, [and] people are presenting [it to the sacrificer], even so let it bring up this man's [recovery] (10) (and) vigor!" Then she takes wine-dregs and ties them [to the sacrificer]. Then she goes to the vineyard, takes a [ . . . ] loaf, breaks it, scatters (the crumbs) about and [says as foll]ows: "Eat ye, gods of the trees! [Just as] ye, gods, (15) let vanish every [trace of the dregs], even so let this man's evil [vanish]!" She . . . takes branches from all (of t h e m ) — b u t . . . she does not take—, makes a float and puts [it into the river]. She returns to the clay pit, deposits a broken loaf for the demons of the clay pit and speaks as follows: (20) "Eat ye, demons of the clay pit! If the wicked sorcerer made over this man's form either to the clay pit or to the current of the river, give it back to him!" Whatever she had taken to the open country, she carries back to the city and deposits it in the city within the inner chamber at a secret spot (25) The Old Woman goes forth and assembles in front of the Sun three pieces of bitumen, (holds) a bronze dagger (in readiness), and also kindles a fire. She throws the water® and the broken loaf into it and speaks as follows: "Whatever words the sorcerer spoke, whatever he twined together, whatever he wove, whatever he made in whatever place, (30) those (things) he did not (properly) know, the sorcerer. He built up sorcery like a pillar, twined it together like a string. I am thwarting him. I have pushed over these words of sorcery like a pillar, I have untwined them like a string." (35) The Old Woman pushes the pieces of bitumen over, breaks them and puts them into the fire. The Old Woman takes the cord, untwines it the left-hand way and untwines it the right-hand way and speaks as follows: "If the sorcerer twined it from the right, (40) I am now untwining it [the right-hand way]. If

he twined it from the left, I am now un[twining] it the left-hand way." (iii) [The Old Woman throws the threads into the fire and says as follows: " . . . ] Just as (5) I have [bu]rned [these threads] and they will not [come back], [even so] let also these words of the sorcerer [be burned] up!" [She then] extinguishes] the fire with water. [She say]s: "I have vanquished them, the words of sorcery. The spell [that was superi]or, my spell-binding has vanquished (it). (10) [Since] I cast a double counterspell—I spat upon them and I trampled them under [foot]—let the ass bloody them and let the ox muck [them]! Let man [not] (even) walk over them, (15) let him [sp]it on them! Let them be spat upon, the words of sorcery and the sorcerer (himself)!"

These are the words of Uhha-muwas, the Arzawa man. If people are dying in the country and if some enemy (45) god has caused that, I act as follows: They drive up one ram. They twine together blue wool, red wool, yellow wool, black wool and white wool, make it into a crown and crown the ram with it They drive the ram on to the road leading to the enemy (50) and while doing so they speak as follows: "Whatever god of the enemy land has caused this plague—see! We have now driven up this crowned ram to pacify thee, O god! Just as the herd (55) is strong, but keeps peace with the ram, do thou, the god who has caused this plague, keep peace with the Hatti land! In favor turn again toward the Hatti land!" (60) They drive that one crowned ram toward the enemy.
Afterward they bring fodder for the god's horses and mutton tallow, and while doing so they speak as follows: (iii) "Thou hast harnessed (thy) horses; let them eat this fodder and let their hunger be satisfied! Let also thy chariot be greased with this mutton tallow! (5) Turn toward thy land, O Storm-god! In favor turn toward the Hatti land!"
Afterward they drive up one full-grown goat and two sheep. He consecrates the goat to the Seven;1 he consecrates one sheep to the Sun-god. (10) The other sheep they kill and cook. Then they bring 1 cheese, 1 curd, 1 pulla (vessel), leavened bread, 1 amphora of wine, 1 amphora of beer, (and) fruit With these they make provision for the god's journey.

Purification Ritual
Engaging the Help of
Protective Demons
Text: KUB, X X V I I , 67. This ritual consists of four parts. The first three of them run mainly parallel with one another except that they are addressed to different demons. In the first section (i) Tarpatassis is invoked, in the second (ii) Alauwaimis, and in the third (most of iii) "he1 who turns in front of the Tarpatassis demons." The fourth part (iii 67-iv 43) again invokes Tarpatassis. Only the second and the fourth parts are translated here.
(ii 2) [Aft]erward she2 pours out a libation for Alauwaimis. She places pine cones upon a large pan and thereupon she strews grains of KAR;3 these they roast. She then extinguishes the cones with water and says: "Just as I have quenched these, even so let evil also be quenched for the sacrificers!" Balls of kneaded dough, (10) a bow of . . . (with the string taut), three arrows of . . . (with the balls of dough in front of them), a bolt, a tarzu (with a piece of fur fastened to it)—all this she places upon a tray of reeds. (15) She takes a cord and strings it from the sacrificers' feet to their heads on either side. She also strings it down their backs. She takes it off them and places it on the tray of reeds (saying): (20) "Loosen the evil tension of [his] head, his hands (and) his [feet]. Give it to (their) wicked adversaries! But to the sacrificers give [li]fe, vigor (and) long years!" She treats the bowstring in the same manner, and speaks in the same way. (25) [The]n she treats the piece of (fur-)cloth in the same manner and says: "Just as the dressers scrape the cloth4 and clear the tufts [away] so that it becomes white, even so let the gods clear away [this] man's evil sickness (30) from his [bo]dy! "[Ala]uwaimis! Fight them no longer! [Go!] Fight this tarzu\ Drive the evil away from them!" She wraps up a small piece of tin in the bowstring (35) and attaches it to the sacrificers' right hands (and) feet. She takes it off them (again) and attaches it to a mouse (with the words): "I have taken the evil off you and transferred it to this mouse. Let this mouse carry it on a long journey to the high mountains, (40) hills and dales!" She turns the mouse loose (saying): "Alauwaimis! This one pursue! I shall give thee a goat to eat!" She sets up an altar of wood and breaks one long sacrificial loaf for the Alauwaimis gods, she breaks one sacrificial loaf for Alauwaimis, she breaks one sacrificial loaf for Mammas and she puts them upon the altars.
She then consecrates a goat for Alauwaimis (saying): "Eat thou!" In front of the loaves she cuts it up and

takes off the right shoulder. She cooks it on a fire (50) and puts [it] in a place apart from the loaves. The liver she offers in the same manner. They cook [the left] shoulder also and she places the shank (upon the altar) for the (Alauwaimis) gods. She places the upper shoulder (upon the altar) for Alauwaimis. She places the . . . (upon the altar) for Mammas. Then she pours out a libation. [Afterward] she offers the heart in the same way. She places one leg (55) [(and) one-half of the hea]d(?) (upon the altar) for the (Alauwaimis) gods. [She places] the other half of the head (upon the altar) [for Alauwaimis] (and) the womb (upon the altar) [for Mammas]; furthermore she pours out a libation. [Then] they cook [the goat] in a cauldron and [eat] (and) drink. Then she scatters silver (and) gold, (60) [lapis], Babylon stone, lulluri stone, "life" stone, [Barahsi stone], iron, tin, copper (and) bronze—a little [of everything] (saying): "[Alauwa]imis! Here [I have given] thee silver, gold, (and) lapis. Go! Say a good word for me before the gods! "Grant [me . . . ] . . . ; grant me to appear before thy face!

^hese are the words of Pissuwattis, the Arzawa woman who lives in Parassa: If a man possesses no reproductive power or has no desire for women, I bring libations to Uliliyassis on his behalf (5) and entreat him for three days. On the first day I prepare as follows: Rations for one man are assembled and to it the following is added: 3 sweet sacrificial loaves of flour (and) water weighing one tarnal, figs, grapes, . . . the god's meal, a little of everything; (10) the fleece of an unblemished sheep, a pitcher of wine, [the headdress] or the shirt of the male sacrificer (in question)—they are put upon the rations. A virgin takes up [these materials], and the sacrificer —(15) having taken [a ba]th—walks behind them; [then] he bathes again. We shall take the materials to another place in the open country. We shall remain standing while [the . .. ]. holds the rations up. I shall build a gate of reeds. I shall twine together [a cord] of red wool (and) of white wool. (20) I shall place a mirror (and) a distaff2 in the sacrificer's [hand]. He will pass under the gate. When he comes [for]th through the gate, I shall take the mirror (and) the distaff away from him.

I shall [gi]ve him a bow [and arrows] and while doing so I shall speak as follows: "See! I have taken womanliness away from thee and given thee back manliness. Thou hast cast off the ways of a woman, now [show] the ways of a man!" (30)" Later we [present a eun]uch (as) a defend[ant] and [ · . . . ] While doing so I shall speak as follows: "Here [we present a eunuch. He has made his nature] the subject of an oracle; (whether) by . . . [the ways] of a man were indicated, or (those) of a girl were indicated for him. For his part he went down to her bedchamber, but all this fellow could produce was excrement (and) urine. Such (will) not be (10) found to be the case with thee! "Now see, he has gone down on his knees and is seeking thee for the sake of thy divine power. Whether thou art in the mountain, whether thou art in the meadow, whether thou art in the valley, (15) or wherever else thou mayest be, in favor come to this man! Let driving wind and rain not hold thee back! "He will go and worship thee, O god! He will provide a place for thee, (20) he will give thee a house. He will give thee slaves (and) slave-girls. He will give thee cattle (and) sheep. He will make vows to thee. "See! I am entreating (and) alluring thee. So come! Bring with thee the moon, the star of the nether world, (and) the sun! (25) Let slave-girls (and) slaves run before thee! Let gods [(and) goddesses] (ii)4 run before thee! Come down to this man! Make his wife conceive a child, look after her! (5) Turn to him and speak to him! Let him have thy maid, and let her bear his yoke! Let him take his wife and beget sons (and) daughters for himself! (10) They will be thy servants and thy handmaids; they will always be giving thee offerings, sacrificial loaves, meal (and) libations. "See! This man (15) knew thee not. See! Now he has sought after thee. Since then this (man) has sought after thee. So stand by him, in favor, O god! (20) In this matter in which he has come to thee, O god, show thy divine power and set all aright! Let him experience thy divine power, make it good! Let him see thy divine nature, and he will come [and worship] thee. (25) . . . ."
5I6 shall take [the materials] from upon the rations and we shall go back into the house. (5) In the house in which I make offerings a new table is set up and I shall put the rations upon that table; in front of it I shall put a pitcher. The broken sacrificial loaves (10) which are lying on the rations, I shall take a little of them and give it to the male sacrificer. He will put it into his mouth, and he will drink (for) Uliliyassis three times. When night falls, the sacrificer (15) will He down in front of the table; they will set up a bed for him in front of the table.

They will spread out a bed for him (15) in front of the table and they will also spread out the headdress or the shirt that had been lying on the rations, (iv) The sacrificer will lie down, (to see) whether he will experience the bodily presence of the deity in his dream, coming to him and sleeping with him. (5) During the three days on which he is entreating the deity he tells all the dreams which he has, whether the deity appears to him and whether the deity (10) sleeps with him.
He will go (and) worship the god. Furthermore, if sacrificial vessels are in order, he will set up sacrificial vessels; if not, (15) he will set up a stone pillar or erect a statue.

(5) She1 takes black wool and wraps it in mutton fat; tiHatwa they call it.2 She presents it to the sacrificer and speaks as follows: "Whatever thou spokest with (thy) mouth (and) tongue®—see, here is tillatwaX Let it be cut out (10) of your body these days!" She throws the tongues into the hearth. Afterward the Old Woman takes salt, tissue, fat and wax. She makes the wax into tongues and waves [them over the two] sacrificers. She also waves the salt and the [fat and] the tissue over them, [presents it to them and they [flatten it] with (their) left (15) hands. The Old Woman speaks as follows: "In whatever curses you indulged, let now the Sun-god turn those curses (and) tongues toward the left!"4 And she throws them into the hearth. The red wool (and) the blue wool that (20) had been placed upon the bodies of the two sacrificers,5 the two figures of dough that had been placed before them, and the hands and tongues of dough that had been placed upon their heads, those the Old Woman removes. She cuts the strings off them, the Old Woman breaks the two hands and the tongues of dough to pieces. (25) She then waves them over them and speaks as follows: "Let the tongues of these [days] be cut off! Let the words of these days be cut off!" And she throws them [into the hearth]. Afterward the Old Woman takes [a tray] and [places] (30) seven tongues [and seven hands . . . ] upon it. She waves it over the two sacrificers and [speaks] as follows: "The day at which ye satisfied your hunger—see here the tongues and the hands of that day. See, the father Sun has now nailed them down." And she puts them into the hearth. The Old Woman takes water and dough. She sprinkles the water upon them" (36) and purified them. Then she waves the dough over them and speaks as follows: "Be ye cleansed of mouth and tongue!" And she puts the dough into the hearth. They drive up a (white) sheep. The Old Woman presents it to the two sacrificers and speaks as follows: "Here is a substitute for you, (40) a substitute for your persons. Let that tongue and that curse stay in (its) mouth!" They spit into its mouth. She speaks as follows: "Spit ye out those evil curses!" They dig a hole in the ground, cut the sheep up over it, and then put it into it.

They cut up the sheep and dismember it. They [kindle] the hearth and [burn] it. They pour honey (and) olive oil over it. She [brea]ks a sacrificial loaf (55) and throws it into the hearth. She also pours out a libation of wine. The Old Woman takes a small pig, she presents it to them6 and speaks as follows: "See! It has been fattened with grass (and) grain. Just as this one shall not see the sky and shall not see the (other) small pigs again, (ii) even so let the evil curses not see these sacrificers either!"
She waves the small pig over them, and then they kill it. They dig a hole in the ground (5) and put it down into it. They put a sacrificial loaf down with it, she also pours out a libation of wine and they level the ground. The Old Woman makes a kneading-pan of clay. She puts into it a little dough into which she throws a little black cumin. She waves it over the two sacrificers (10) and speaks as follows: "Just as this clay does not return to the clay pit and this cumin does not turn white and cannot be used for seed a second time; "(as) this dough does not get into a sacrificial loaf for the gods, even so let the evil tongue not get to the body of the two sacrificers!" (The following sections7 are not intelligible as yet.) The Old Woman [waves] water over the two sacrificers and purifies them. She also [waves] the dough over them. (30) Afterward she again makes a kneading-pan of clay and pours oil into it. She severs the blue wool and throws the severed end in. The Old Woman hides it under the coats of the two sacrificers. and she speaks as follows: "This is the kneading-pan of Ishtar.® May they get away to good life! May they hide from evil matter likewise!" Afterwards she takes a hupuwai vessel and fills it with wine, plain olive oil (and) honey; she adds figs, raisins, tissue, salt (and) mutton-fat. (40) She pours the (content of the) hupuwai into the hearth, breaks the hupuwai to pieces and speaks as follows: "Let the hupuwai be broken with mouth (and) tongue!" When the Old Woman has broken the hupuwai to pieces, (45) she also breaks a sweet loaf and throws (the crumbs) into the hearth. They drive up a sheep and call it "substitute." The Old Woman takes 1 sweet sacrificial loaf (and) 1 jug of wine. While offering the sheep to the Sun-god the Old Woman speaks as follows: (50) "O Sun-god! Here is

The Old Woman presents one sacrificial loaf weighing i tarnai and a cheese to the two sacrificers and they touch it with their hands. (15) The Old Woman breaks the sacrificial loaf, pours out a libation of wine and speaks as follows: "Whoever erected these stone pillars in this one place—see, now they totter. Whatever issued from the mouths (and) the tongues of the two sacrificers on that day—let those words totter in the same way!" The two sacrificers overturn the stone pillars with (their) feet and throw them into the fire. (25) The fine garments which they are wearing they cast off and the Old Woman gets them. She waves a pot over them, takes the DUG.LIIGAL9 off their heads and sp[eaks] as follows: "See! [I have taken the DUG.LIS.GAL] off your heads. [Let the evil] words [be taken off in the same way]!" (35) [ . . . ] the two sacrificers break the pot with their feet and [she says as follows: "Let them break] all the words [erf mouth (and) tongue in the same way]!" The Old Woman takes the Sun's hay,10 calls it tiwariya11 and rubs down the limbs of the two sacrificers. She speaks as follows: "Let the evil words of mouth (and) tongue be rubbed away from you!" (iv) The Old Woman takes water with a cup or an amphora and presents it to the two sacrificers; salt is also put in. The two sacrificers pour the water over their heads, (5) they also rinse their hands (and) their eyes. Then they pour it into the horn of an ox. The two sacrificers seal it up and the Old Woman speaks as follows: (10) "On the day when the olden kings return and examine the state of the land,—then, and then only, shall this seal be broken."

are made ready as follows: (5) there lies (in it) one hupparal, upon it lies one sacrificial loaf made of fine flour, upon the loaf a (piece of) cedar is fastened and to the front (of the piece) of cedar red wool is tied. It (the wool) is led down (to the ground). Fine oil . . . is poured into a bitumen cup and he soa\s it (the wool) in it; (10) fine flour is strewn over it Upon it 30 thin loaves of fine flour are placed. A . . . of the gods . . . , the wing of an eagle (and) the fleece of an unblemished sheep, are (also) placed there all wrapped together. Apart (from these) are (kept) one wine jug (and) one pitcher filled with wine, (10) honey (and) fine oil mixed together, one jar of fine oil, one jar of honey; also fruit, figs, grapes, olives, barley, a broken leavened loaf, one pot filled with fat cake. They go down from the Tawinia gate and set up a wickerwork table for the "cedar" gods on the road. (20) Upon it they place the prepared basket and in front of it they construct a fireplace for (burning) wood. They draw a length of cloth down from the wickerwork table and make it into a trail. Then they draw a trail in fine flour in front of the cloth; on the one side of the flour trail they draw a trail in honey, but on the other side they draw a trail in wine (25) (and) fine oil mixed together. He then breaks one thin (loaf), puts fat cake upon it and places it on the ends of the trails. He breaks one thin loaf, strews it upon the trail and pours out a libation of wine. He breaks one thin loaf, puts fat cake upon it, and places it upon the path, he also pours out a libation of wine. (30) One diviner takes the red wool that had been tied to the (piece of) cedarwood from the [ . . . ]. bitumen cup, out of the fine oil, and sprinkles [the trails] with fine oil. One diviner lifts up the wing of the eagle on which the . . . is lying and squeals; the diviner speaks the . . . [ . . . ] . prayer.

He throws them on a flame and says: "Just as this wax melts, and just as the mutton fat dissolves,—(45) whoever breaks these oaths, (ii) [shows disrespect to the king] of the Hatti [land], let [him] melt lik[e wax], let him dissolve like [mutton fat]!"

When they perform the ritual at the boundary of the enemy country he consecrates one sheep to the Sungoddess of Arinna and to the Storm-god, god Inar (and) all the gods, to Telepinus (and) the gods and goddesses of Turmitta, (5) to all . . . gods (and) the .. . gods, to all the mountains (and) rivers. But one sheep they consecrate to Zithariyas. (10) They speak as follows: "See! Zithariyas is appealing to all the gods. The offerings which had long been assigned to Zithariyas' worship, the countries which have fallen into turmoil—in all of them they would celebrate great festivals for him. (16) "But now the Kashkeans1 have taken them. The Kashkeans have begun war. They boast of their power (and) strength. They have made light of you, O gods! "See! Zithariyas (20) is appealing to all the gods; he brings his complaints before you. So pass judgment on his case, all ye gods! Let it be of great concern to the gods! "In fact they (the sanctuaries) have been taken away by these people not from Zithariyas alone, (25) they have been taken away from all you gods, all of you; from the Sun-goddess of Arinna, from the Storm-god of Nerik, from the Storm-god (and) from god Inar, from Telepinus (and) from all the (other) gods. From you (also) have his cities been taken. (30) "See! Zithariyas is bringing his case before all of you, gods. Take your own case to heart! Pass judgment on your own case in passing judgment on the case of Zithariyas! (35) "Blot out the Kashkean country, O gods! Let every single god take thought for his place of worship and win it back! "Let Zithariyas win back his place of worship! Let him again roam those countries (40) at will! Let people again celebrate [his] great festivals! . . . " (Gap that must have contained a ritual in which the enemy gods are summoned.) (11) And he speaks as follows: "O gods of the Kashkean country! We have summoned you before this assembly.

(15) "The Kashkean people also began war. From the Hittites ye took away their cities and ye drove them out of their field (and) fallow and out of their vineyards. "The gods of the Hatti land and the (Hittite) people (20) call for bloody vengeance.

Removal of the Threat Implied
in an Evil Omen
Text: KUB, ix, 13-}-KUB, xxiv, 5. Literature: M. Vieyra, RHR, cxix (1939), 121-153. The upper third of the obverse and the corresponding part of the reverse are lost. The missing beginning must have stated the main theme of the text: a threat to the king implied in an evil omen. It must also have contained part of the treatment. It consists in the attempt at deflecting the predicted misfortune to persons who substitute for the king. The first preserved lines seem to finish the treatment of a first group of such substitutes. The better preserved part (beginning with obverse 6) deals already with a second group.
[During the night1 the king] takes the . . . [substitutes and goes to the sanctuary of the Moon-god. [He presents them to the Moon-god and] says: "In the matter about which [I prayed] to you, listen to me, Moon-god, my lord! [That omen which thou] gavest—if thou foundest fault with me, (10) (witness) that I have given [thee] straightaway [these substitutes. These take, [but let me go fr]ee!" They drive up to the sanctuary a live steer [and conse]crate it [...].

The king goes up to the sanctuary [and speaks as follows: "That] omen which thou gavest, O Moongod—if thou foundest fault with me [and] wishedst to behold with thine own eyes [the sinner's] abasement, (15) [see, I, the king,] have come in person [to thy sanctuary] and have [given] thee these substitutes. Consider [the substitution! Let these die! But, let me not die!" They hand [the substitutes over to the . .. ] and he takes them away. [When] he has finished .. .ing [them], he2 casts (spells of) deliverance (over him).8 He [brings a healthy prisoner to the sanctuary]. They anoint the prisoner with the fine oil of kingship, (20) and [he4 speaks] as follows: "This man (is) the king. To him [have I given] a royal name. Him have I clad [in the vestments] of kingship. Him have I crowned with the diadem. Remember ye this: That evil omen [signifies] short years (and) short days. Pursue ye this substitute!" The one shekel of silver, the one shekel of gold, the one mina of copper, (25) the one mina of tin, the one mina of iron, the one mina of lead, all this is removed from his [body].8 The one healthy prisoner is released, and he has him taken back to his country. The king submits to the waving ceremony, and afterward the king goes to bathe. When it dawns, the king submits to the waving ceremony and afterward he performs the "Ritual of the House" (and) the "Pure Ritual." When it is light, the king performs the "[ .. . ] Rite." (30) When he goes away he takes a bath and consecrates one .. . sheep to the Sun-god under the open sky. Words [of . . . ] he speaks as follows: "Sun-god of Heaven, my lord! That omen which the Moon-god gave—if he found fault with me, accept ye, Sun-god of Heaven and (all) ye gods, these substitutes that I have given (35) and let me go free! To (appearing before) thee, I might prefer appearing before die Sun-goddess of Arinna."

When they rebuild a temple that had been destroyed

Ritual for the Erection
of a New Palace
Text: KUB, xxix, 1 and its duplicates KUB, xxix, 2 and 3.
Literature: B. Schwartz, Orientaiia, NS xvi (1947), 23-55; the
lines i 26-41 and ii 39-54 are dealt with by H. G. Giiterbock,
RHA,YI (1942-43), 102-9.
[When the king] builds [a new palace and when the time comes for roofing it] with timber, [they speak as follows:] "By consulting [the Sun-god] and the Storm-god they have found out [that it is the right time for roofing the palace which] you are building."
A. ERECTION OF THE PALACE
Plastering the Walls
(5) When you have finished [building] the palace, and [when you plaster (it)] on the inside, plaster (it) with long years [(and) plast]er (it) [with well-being]! [When you plaster (it) ] on the outside, plaster (it) with awe, plaster (it) [with lordlin]ess!
Procuring Timber for the Roof
(It comes from the Mountain where the Throne rules.) (10) The king says to the Throne: "Come! Let us go! But stay thou behind the mountains! Thou must not become my rival, thou must not become my inlaw! Remain my [equal] (and) my friend! "Come! Let us go to the Mountain! I, the king, will give thee glassware. Let us eat from glassware! Rule thou over the Mountain! "To me, the king, have the gods—Sun-god and Stormgod—entrusted the land and my house. I, the king, shall rule over my land and my house. Thou shouldst not come to my house, (20) and I shall not come to thy house. "To me, the king, have the gods granted long years; to these years there is no limit. "To me, the king, has the Throne brought from the Sea the (insignia of) authority (and) the coach;1 thereupon have they opened to me the land of my mother2 and called me (25) Labarnas, the King.
"From then on I have been directing my request to the Storm-god, my father. The king has been asking the Storm-god for the timber which the rains have made strong (and) tall.
1 Apparently considered as characteristic (or a king. 2 The meaning of this phrase is not at all clear.
"Under the heavens ye® grew. The lion would rest beneath you, the panther would rest beneath you, the bear (30) would hide in you. The Storm-god, my father, kept evil away from you. "Cattle pastured beneath you, sheep pastured beneath you. Now I, the Labarnas, the King, have claimed my share of you. I hailed the Throne, my friend (and said): (35) " 'Art thou not a friend of me, the king? Let me have that tree (that) I may cut it down!'" And the Throne answers the King: "Cut it down, cut (it) down! The Sun-god and the Storm-god have placed it at thy disposal"
Charm Spoken over the Trees
"Now come ye up from that country of yours! The Storm-god has placed you (40) at the King's disposal. They will assign work to you. He will procure (experts) for you and they will pronounce charms over you. "Whatever is in your heart, cast it out! If (it is) a flaw, remove it! If (it is) an evil (45) .. ., cast it out! If (it is) a curse, cast it out! "If weakness is in your heart, or (if) the ailment of the sun is in your heart, sweep it out! I, the Labarnas, the King, will come (and) put steel4 and iron in your heart."
B. ENTRY INTO THE NEW PALACE
(50) When the king makes his entry into the house, the Throne hails the Eagle: "Go! I am sending thee to the Sea. When thou gettest there, drive out of field and woods those who still remain there!" (ii) That one (i.e. the Eagle) answers: "I have driven (them) out. Only Isdustaya (and) Papaya who are the eternal gods of the nether world still remain there crouching." (5) The Throne says: "What are they doing?" That one (i.e. the Eagle) answers him: "She® is holding a distaff; they are holding mirrors (and) combs. "They are spinning the king's years. There is no limit to these years, no number (10) holds good for them." The Throne says to the king: "Now bring all the king's sons to the palace window!" The skilled weaver women are divided into two parties. Before (one of) them he6 places glassware and strews figs thereon. (15) Before the (other) he places crockery and strews grapes and fruit thereon (saying): "Soothe ye the king! "Soothe his eyes! Keep sickness from him! Keep terror from him! Keep . .. from him! Keep the headsickness from him! (20) Keep man's evil word from h i m ! . . . keep the knee-sickness (from him)! Keep the heart-sickness (from him)!"
"Stay, great star!"7 (he says) and halts the mountains in their place. "Mount Pentaya, stay in thy place! (25) Thou shalt not raise the great one!8 Mount Harga,

stay in thy place! Thou shalt not raise the great one! Mount Tudhaliya, stay in thy place! Thou shalt not raise the great one! "Mount [Sidjduweni9 (and) Mount Piskurunuwa, stay ye in your places! Ye shall not raise the great one!" (30) [When] the king goes to the mountain to raise the great Sun, he10 performs various charms (and) incantations (all of die general kind): "Such (and) such a one has taken an ailment away from the king." "Affliction this one has taken away. Concern this one has taken away. Awe this one has taken away. Fear (35) this one has taken away. Heart-sickness this one has taken away. Sickness this one has taken away. Old age this one has taken away. Vigor this one has given back to him. Prowess this one has given back to him." "Come thou, Eagle! Go forth! One of my charms (40) has failed. Go to the ghats11 and bring a piece of crockery!
"Upon it put together a lion's tail (and) a panther's tail\ Keep hold of them! "Twine them together and make them one. Place them at man's heart. (45) Let the king's heart and soul be reunited! "Let the Sun-god and the Storm-god enter into accord with the king! Let their word become one! Entrust ye, Sun-god and Storm-god, the land to the king! (50) They have restored his years, they have restored his awesomeness. "They have made his frame of steel.12 They have made his head of iron. They have made his eyes those of an eagle. They have made his teeth those of a lion. (iii) "Let Telepinus come and open [the store]house, take out wine, nine casks, and bring (it) to the Mountain, all gods being assembled on the Mountain! They will make the king welcome (5) and give him their approval. "The Sun-god and the Storm-god have taken care of the king. They have renewed his strength and set no limits to his years. "They have strewn leppit and euwan and crushed it (saying) (10): 'He who plots evil against the king, let the gods abandon him to an evil fate! Let them crush him!'"
C. PROVISIONS FOR T H E WORKMEN
In whatever town he13 builds a palace, the carpenter who goes to the mountain to cut the beams (15) receives from the palace one bull, three sheep, three jugs of wine, one jug of marnuwanf* ten wageliar loaves, thirty "tooth loaves," and fifty "ration loaves." When the carpenter goes to cut the ridgepole (and) the rafters, he receives from the palace (20) twentyfive "tooth loaves" and fifty "ration loaves."
8 The restoration of the name is quite uncertain. 10 The officiating priest, or perhaps the king. 11 The place where the dead are cremated. 12 Literally: tin. 1» The king. 14 An alcoholic beverage.
When they lay the foundations, they receive from the palace one bull, one cow, and ten sheep. They sacrifice the bull to the Storm-god, and the one cow to the Sungoddess of Arinna. (25) They sacrifice the sheep, everyone for another deity. Loaves and wine they receive from the palace. When they stretch the beams across, they act in the same way again.

Egyptian Hymns and Prayers
TRANSLATOR: JOHN A. WILSON
A Hymn to Amon-Re
Egypt's world position under her Empire produced strong tendencies toward centralization and unification of Egyptian religion, with universalism and with syncretism of the gods. The following hymn antedates the Amarna Revolution. The imperial god Amon-Re is here viewed as supreme and as the force which creates and sustains life. Papyrus Boulaq 17 in the Cairo Museum dates from the Eighteenth Dynasty (1550-1350 B.C.). It was published by A. Mariette, Les Papyrus igyptiens du MusSe de Boulaq (Paris, 1871-76), 11, Pis. XI-XIII. A facsimile of six columns is in G. Moller, Hieratische Lesestucfa 11 (Leipzig, 1927), 33-34. The text was studied by E. Gribaut, Hymne h Ammon-Ra (Paris, 1874). The manuscript is divided by marks of pause into four stanzas. Selim Hassan, Hymnes religieux du moyen empire (Cairo, 1928), 157-93, pointed out that British Museum statue 40959, which has been dated to the Thirteenth to Seventeenth Dynasties (1775-1575 B.C.), carries this hymn in broken context. Translated by Erman, LAE, 282-88.
ADORATION of Amon-Re, the Bull Residing in Heli

gives life to all that is warm and to all good cattle.
Hail to thee, Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, Presiding
over Karnak,
Bull of His Mother,1 Presiding over His Fields!
Far-reaching of stride, presiding over Upper Egypt,
Lord of the Madjoi and ruler of Punt,2
Eldest of heaven, first-born of earth,
Lord of what is, enduring in all things, enduring in
all things. (5)
UNIQUE IN HIS NATURE LIKE THE FLUID of the gods,
The goodly bull of the Ennead, chief of all gods,
The lord of truth and father of the gods.
Who made mankind and created the beasts,
Lord of what is, who created the fruit tree,
Made herbage, and gave life to cattle.
The goodly daemon whom Ptah made,

The goodly beloved youth to whom the gods give praise, (1) Who made what is below and what is above, Who illuminates the Two Lands And crosses the heavens in peace: The King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Re, the triumphant,9 Chief of the Two Lands, Great of strength, lord of reverence,
1 As sun-god, Amon-Re recreated himself every day. 2 Regions to the south and southeast of Egypt. 3 Written as though Amon-Re were a former pharaoh.
The chief one, who made the entire earth.
MORE DISTINGUISHED IN NATURE THAN any (other) god,
In whose beauty the gods rejoice,
To whom is given jubilation in the Per-wer,
Who is given ceremonial appearance in the Per-nezer.4
Whose fragrance the gods love, when he comes from
Punt, Rich in perfume, when he comes down (from)
Madjoi, (5)
The Beautiful of Face who comes (from) God's
Land.5
The gods FAWN (at) his feet,
According as they recognize his majesty as their lord,
The lord of fear, great of dread, Rich in might, terrible of appearances,
Flourishing in offerings and making provisions. Jubilation to thee who made the gods, Raised the heavens and laid down the ground!

He who awakes in health, Min-Amon,6 Lord of eternity, who made everlastingness, Lord of praise, presiding over [the Ennead], Firm of horns, beautiful of face, Lord of the uraeus-serpent, lofty of plumes, Beautiful of diadem, and lofty of White Crown. The serpent-coil and the Double Crown, these are before him, The aromatic gum which is in the palace,
The Double Crown, the head-cloth, and the Blue Crown. Beautiful of face, when he receives the atef-crown, He whom the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt love, Lord of the Double Crown, when he receives the ames-s taff, (5) Lord of the me^es-sceptcr, holding the flail.1
THE GOODLY ruler, CROWNED WITH THE WHITE CROWN,
The lord of rays, who makes brilliance, To whom the gods give thanksgiving, Who extends his arms to him whom he loves, (But) his enemy is consumed by a flame. It is his Eye that overthrows the rebels, That sends its spear into him that sucks up Nun,
4 T h e Per-wer, "Great House," was the religious capital of Upper Egypt at el-Kab; the Per-nezer was the counterpart for Lower Egypt at Buto. 5 "God's L a n d " was the east generally, the land of the rising sun. The countries south and east of Egypt were the incense-bearing lands. 8 Amon had strong derivative ties with the old god of procreation Min of Koptos. 7 The text describes Amon-Re with the various accoutrements of an Egyptian pharaoh.

Who hears the prayer of him who is in captivity,
Gracious of heart in the face of an appeal to him.

A Universalist Hymn to the Sun
The forces of empire and of international contacts were moving Egypt toward universalism and a partial approach to monotheism, even before the Amarna Revolution. One of the clearest expressions of the new spirit comes from a hymn to the sun-god on behalf of two brothers named Seth and Horus. The date and provenience of the text are given in the facts that Seth and Horus were architects at Thebes under Amenhotep III (about 1413-1377 B.C.). The hymn occurs on two stelae, British Museum 826 and the badly broken Cairo 34051!* The publications are Hieroglyphic Texts from Egyptian Stelae, &c., in the British Museum, V I I I (ed. by I. E. S. Edwards; London, 1939), 22-25, PI. xxi; A. Varille in BIFAO, xu (1942), 25-30; and the comments by J. S. F. Garnot in JEA, xxxv (1949), 63-88.1
Praising Amon, when he rises as Har-akhti, by the
Overseer of the Works of Amon, Seth, and the Overseer
of the Works of Amon, Horus. They say:
Hail to thee, beautiful Re of every day, who rises
at dawn without ceasing, Khepri wearying (himself)
with labor! Thy rays are in (one's) face, without one
knowing it. Fine gold is not like the radiance of thee.
Thou who hast constructed thyself,2 thou didst fashion
25 Egyptian Babylon was a city near modern Cairo. 26 Ta-tem "all m a n k i n d , " provides a pun for A t u m , sekheper "creator," a pun for Khepri.
1 Amon Re Har-akhti, himself a syncretic deity, is greeted as the "sole lord" of universal sway, but this does not preclude the worship of other deities. In the scenes and texts surrounding the main inscription, the brothers give service to Osiris, Anubis, Amon-Re, Mut, Khonsu, Hat-Hor in two forms, Re Har-akhti, Sokar, Isis, and the deified queen Ahmes Nefert-iri. 2 "Thou who hast Ptah'ed thyself," a play on the name of Ptah, the fashioner-god.

Amon as the Sole God
The following hymns have been characterized as monotheistic in spirit. They come from the Nineteenth Dynasty, subsequent

Budge, The Book of the Dead (London, 1898), Text Vol., 41-42. 8 Most of this paragraph occurs also in the Book of the Dead hymn just noted. 4 T h e western mountain. 5 T h e word is Egyptian Aton. 8 The gods' names carry a pun: "the hidden builder of mankind." T The picture is that of the apes who greet the warmth of the morning sun with jabberings and gesticulations. 8 The final 7 lines of the stela carry successive statements by the two brothers. Seth avows: "I am a just man, whose abomination is deceit, not content with any words of him who speaks equivocally—except for my brother, like unto me: I am content with his ideas, for he came forth from the womb together with me on that (same) day." Each twin emphasizes his good works for Amon, in asking benefits from that god.
to the Amarna Revolution. They are extracts from a long document in praise of the imperial god Amon-Re of Thebes and treat that deity as the sole god, or, perhaps, as the first principle and the sole god of immediate attention. The bibliography for Leyden Papyrus I 350 was given on p. 8 above.1
HUNDREDTH STANZA.
The first to come into being in the earliest times,
Amon, who came into being at the beginning, so that
his mysterious nature is unknown. No god came into
being before him; there was no other (iv 10) god with
him, so that he might tell his form. He had no mother,
after whom his name might have been made. He had
no father who had begotten him and who might
have said: "This is I!" Building his own egg, a daemon
mysterious of birth, who created his (own) beauty, the
divine god who came into being by himself. All (other)
gods came into being after he began himself.
TWO-HUNDREDTH STANZA.
Mysterious of form, glistening of appearance, the marvelous god of many forms. All (other) gods boast of him, to magnify themselves through his beauty, according as he is divine.2 Re himself is united with his body. He is the great one who is in Heliopolis.8 He is called Ta-tenen,4 and Amon who came forth from Nun, for he leads the people. Another of his forms is the Ogdoad.5 The procreator of the (15) primeval gods, who brought Re to birth; he completed himself as Atum," a single body with him. He is the All-Lord, the beginning of that which is. His soul, they say, is that which is in heaven. It is he who is in the underworld and presides over the East; his soul is in heaven, his body is in the West, and his statue is in Hermonthis, heralding his appearances.7 One is Amon, hiding himself from them,8 concealing himself from the (other) gods, so that his (very) color is unknown. He is far from heaven, he is absent from the Underworld, (so that) no gods know his true form.9 His image is not displayed in writings. No one bears witness to him . . . He is too mysterious that his majesty might be disclosed, he is too great that (men) should ask about him, too powerful that he might be known. (20) Instandy (one) falls in a death of violence at the utterance of his mysterious name, unwittingly or wittingly.10 No (other) god knows how to call him by it, the Soul who hides his name, according as he is mysterious.

T The statue was not the god himself, but gave opportunity for his appearances at a cult-seat of his. 8 The name Amon may mean "hidden." 9 Probably invisibility, rather than absence. 10 His secret name carries the blight of awful holiness, cf. pp. 12-14 above.

The God Amon as Healer
and Magician
A Nineteenth Dynasty manuscript contains poetical praise of the Theban god Amon-Re. In one stanza of this composition the god is treated as a divine physician and magical healer. The bibliography for Leyden Papyrus I 350 was given on p. 8 above.1
11 The text does not say: "There is no fourth to them." This is a statement of trinity, the three chief gods of Egypt subsumed into one of them, Amon. 12 cf. n.8 above. 13 Ptah. The two messages state the primacy of Thebes. As various commentators have pointed out, the text has probable relation to the resumption of power by Thebes after the Amarna Revolution. 14 Probably Thebes, possibly the authority claimed by Thebes. 15 Thebes. 18 The rubricized heading is lacking in the papyrus. 17 Sia "cognitive perception," and Hu "authoritative utterance," were deified as two attributes of rule, through the ability to comprehend a situation and the power to create by command. 18 The Nile was supposed to flow forth from two subterranean caves, sometimes located at Elephantine, cf. p. 32, n . n . 19 Sun and moon.

T h e Hymn to the Aton
The Pharaoh Amen-hotep IV broke with the established religion of Egypt and instituted the worship of the Aton, the sun disc as the source of life. "The Amarna Revolution" attempted a distinct break with Egypt's traditional and static ways of life in religion, politics, art, and literature. Pharaoh changed his name to Akh-en-Aton (perhaps "He Who Is Serviceable to the Aton") and moved his capital from Thebes to Tell el-Amarna. Pharaoh's own attitude to the god is expressed in the famous hymn which follows. Beyond doubt, the hymn shows the universality and beneficence of the creating and re-creating sun disc. A similarity of spirit and wording to the 104th Psalm has often been noted, and a direct relation between the two has been argued.1 Because Akh-en-Aton was devoted to this god alone, the Amarna religion has been called monotheistic. This is a debatable question, and a reserved attitude would note that only Akh-en-Aton and his family worshiped the Aton, Akh-en-Aton's courtiers worshiped Akh-en-Aton himself, and the great majority of Egyptians was ignorant of or hostile to the new faith. This is the "long hymn" to the Aton, from the tomb of Eye at Tell el-Amarna. Akh-en-Aton's reign was about 1380 to 1362 B.C. The best copy of the text is that of N. de G. Davies, The Roci^ Tombs of El Amarna, vi (London, 1908), PI. xxvu. Translations will be found in Erman, LAE, 288-91, and in J. H. Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience (New York, 1933), 281-86*
2 T h e number "seventy," which contained the sounds safehjk is carried over in a pun to the beginning and end of the stanza, with the words sefe\h "dissolve," and \hesef "oppose." 8 The role of Fate was powerful at this period, but not immutable if the god intervened. * From the context, this continues the idea of Amon as a soothing breeze against more violent winds.

Though thou art far away, thy rays are on earth;
Though thou art in their faces, no one bjtows thy

When thou settest in the western horizon,
The land is in darkness, in the manner of death.
They sleep in a room, with heads wrapped up,
Nor sees one eye the other.
All their goods which are under their heads might
be stolen,
(But) they would not perceive (it).
Every lion is come forth from his den;
All creeping things, they sting.
Darkness is a shroud, and the earth is in stillness,
For he who made them rests in his horizon.6
At daybreak, when thou arisest on the horizon,
When thou shinest as the Aton by day,
Thou drivest away the darkness and givest thy rays.
The Two Lands are in festivity every day,

Creator of seed in women,
Thou who makest fluid into man,
Who maintainest the son in the womb of his mother,
Who soothest him with that which stills his weeping,
Thou nurse (even) in the womb,
Who givest breath to sustain all that he has made!
When he descends from the womb to breathe
On the day when he is born,
Thou openest his mouth completely,
Thou suppliest his necessities.
When the chick in the egg speaks within the shell,
Thou givest him breath within it to maintain him.
When thou hast made him his fulfillment within the

He walks upon his legs when he comes forth from it.
How manifold it is, what thou hast made!

Whilst thou wert alone:10
All men, cattle, and wild beasts, Whatever is on earth, going upon (its) feet, And what is on high, flying with its wings.
The countries of Syria and Nubia, the land of Egypt, Thou settest every man in his place, Thou suppliest their necessities: Everyone has his food, and his time of life is reckoned.11 Their tongues are separate in speech, And their natures as well; Their skins are distinguished, As thou distinguishest the foreign peoples.

And for the beasts of every desert that go upon

Thy rays suckle every meadow. When thou risest, they live, they grow for thee. Thou makest the seasons in order to rear all that thou hast made, The winter to cool them, And the heat that they may taste thee. Thou hast made the distant sky in order to rise therein, In order to see all that thou dost make. Whilst thou wert alone, Rising in thy form as the living Aton,
Appearing, shining, withdrawing or approaching, Thou madest millions of forms of thyself alone. Cities, towns, fields, road, and riverEvery eye beholds thee over against them, For thou art the Aton of the day over the earth
Thou art in my heart, And there is no other that knows thee Save thy son Nefer-kheperu-Re Wa-en-Re,15 For thou hast made him well-versed in thy plans and in thy strength.16
The world came into being by thy hand, According as thou hast made them. When thou hast risen they live, When thou settest they die. Thou art lifetime thy own self, For one lives (only) through thee. Eyes are (fixed) on beauty until thou settest. All work is laid aside when thou settest in the west. (But) when (thou) risest (again), [Everything is] made to flourish for the king,...

18 cf. Ps. 104:6, 10. 11 The rain of foreign countries is like the Nile of rainless Egypt. 15 Even though the hymn was recited by the official Eye, he states that Akh-en-Aton alone knows the Aton. 18 Pharaoh was the official intermediary between the Egyptians and their gods. The Amarna religion did not change this dogma.

Hymns to the Gods as a Single God
These hymns have been called monotheistic. Whether they are so or not will depend upon the definition of monotheism and whether tendencies toward syncretism and universalism may be sufficient explanations. The hymns present different Egyptian gods of universal or cosmic nature, treated as a conflate personality and addressed in the singular. Papyrus Chester Beatty IV (now British Museum 10684), recto vii 2 fif. The hieratic manuscript is probably from Thebes and dates to somewhere around 1300 B.C., definitely after the Amarna Revolution.

of the Gods!1
PRAISE TO THEE, Amon-Re-Atum-Har-akhti, who spoke

settled in the towns thereof, and the productive meadows,

things without limit to their number, for the provision
of the living.

Hymn to the Nile
The Egyptians recognized that life was possible in their land only because of the existence of the Nile. The following hymn celebrated their gratitude. The extant texts have been brutally corrupted by schoolboys, who had to copy the hymn as an exercise. Fortunately, some of the briefer fragments give a more sensible text. The text is a Theban composition. The documents are numerous, and the majority of them are fragmentary. Perhaps all of them derive from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties (1350-1100 B.C.), but the original composition may have gone
6 Amon-Re. T For the concept of the real Nile coming from underground caverns and of the rain as a Nile in the sky and falling upon the mountain tops, see the hymn to the Aton, p. 370 above. 8 Diseases of the eye were common in Egypt. As a god of the weather, the deity averts hay "rain," and shenit "clouds," as a curative eye cosmetic averts haty "dim sight," and shenu "pain." 9 Commonly the goddess Ma'at, 'Truth," is the daughter of Re. Thus she comes forth from him. Here he is so composite a being that she may also be his mother. 10 Khepri is the youthful form of the sun as it emerges at dawn from Nun, the underwaters, and moves to Nut, the sky-goddess. 11 The remainder of the text deals with various beneficial activities of the sun-god, called Re and "the herdsman." T w o extracts are given. 12 Like the sun, man entered into Nun, the underwaters, was refreshed, and emerged at dawn, renewed in life. For the relation of this to sleep, see A. de Buck, De Godsdienstige Opvatting van den Slaap . . .

( x i 6) WORSHIP OF THE NILE.
Hail to thee, O Nile, that issues from the earth and
comes to keep Egypt alive! Hidden in his form of
appearance,1 a darkness by day, to whom minstrels have
sung. He that waters the meadows which Re created,
in order to keep every kid2 alive. He that makes to
drink the desert and the place distant from water: that
is his dew coming down (from) heaven.8 The beloved
of Geb,4 the one who controls Nepri,® and the one who
makes the craftsmanship of Ptah to flourish.
T H E LORD OF FISHES, HE WHO MAKES the marsh-birds
TO GO UPSTREAM." There are no birds which come down
because of the hot winds.7 He who makes barley and
brings emmer into being, that he may make the temples
festive. If he is sluggish, (xii i) then nostrils are stopped
up,8 and everybody is poor. If there be (thus) a cutting
down in the food-offerings of the gods, then a million
men perish among mortals, covetousness is practised,
the entire land is in a fury, and great and small are on
the execution-bloc^. (But) people are different when
he approaches. Khnum constructed him. When he rises,
then the land is in jubilation, then every belly is in joy,
every backbone takes on laughter, and every tooth is
exposed.9
T H E BRINGER OF FOOD, rich in provisions, creator of
all good, lord of majesty, sweet of fragrance. What is in
him is satisfaction. He who brings grass into being
for the cattle and (thus) gives (5) sacrifice to every
god, whether he be in the underworld, heaven, or
earth, him who is under his authority. He who takes
in possession the Two Lands, fills the magazines, makes
the granaries wide, and gives things (to) the poor.
H E WHO MAKES every beloved TREE TO GROW, without
lac\ them. He who brings a ship into being by his
strength, without hewing in stone. The enduring image
with the White Crown.10 He cannot be seen; (he has)

The Hymn of Victory
of Thut-mose III
This hymn celebrating the conquests of the great Egyptian empire-builder, Thut-mose III, carried a victorious theme which became popular with later pharaohs. Amen-hotep III, Seti I, and Ramses III borrowed freely from the triumphant stanzas. The stela containing the hymn was found in the temple of Karnak and is now in the Cairo Museum (34010). The approximate dates of the pharaohs who used themes from the hymn are: Thut-mose III, 1490-1436 B.C.; Amen-hotep III, 1413-1377; Seti I, 1318-1301; and Ramses III, 1195-1164.

I establish thee in my dwelling place. I wor\ a

of thee in all lands, the terror of thee as far as the four

From Amen-hotep Ill's
Building Inscription
The following inscription illustrates the reciprocal relation between pharaoh and god in ancient Egypt. At great length Amen-hotep III (about 1413-1377 B.C.) details his building activities on behalf of the god Amon-Re. The text closes with the grateful hymn of the god to the king. The stela is now Cairo 34025. It was set up by Amen-hotep III in his temple which stood behind the Colossi of Memnon at Thebes. The text was thoroughly hacked up under the Amarna Revolution, but restored under Seti I. Then Mer-ne-Ptah appropriated the stela and used its back for the "Israel Stela" in his mortuary temple, where it was found by W. M. F. Petrie; see his Six Temples at Thebes (London, 1897), 10-11, 23-26; Pis. XI-XII. It was published by P. Lacau, Stiles du nouvel empire
13 la contrast to "the ends of the lands" just above, this term would apply to the countries near Egypt, including the "Sand-Dwellers" of the nearby Asiatic deserts. 14 Shat-Djeba (the reading is uncertain) was in Nubia. 15 Horus and Seth. 16 Isis and Nephthys. 17 As Erman has pointed out, there is deliberate alliteration in the passage "the arms . . . evil," sounding something like: 'awi hemi Air heru hir seheri djut.

Hymn of Victory
of Mer-ne-Ptah
(The "Israel Stela")
The date of this commemorative hymn (or series of hymns) relates it to Mer-ne-Ptah's victory over the Libyans in the

spring of his fifth year (about 1230 B.C.). However, the text is not historical in the same sense as two other records of that victory, but is rather a poetic eulogy of a universally victorious pharaoh. Thus it was not out of place to introduce his real or figurative triumph over Asiatic peoples in the last poem of the hymn. In that context we meet the only instance of the name "Israel" in ancient Egyptian writing. The "Israel Stela," now Cairo 34025, was discovered by Petrie in the ruins of Mer-ne-Ptah's mortuary temple at Thebes. There is also a fragmentary duplicate in the Temple of Karnak. First published by W. M. F. Petrie, Six Temples at Thebes (London, 1897), Pis. XIII-XIV, later by P. Lacau, Stiles du nouvel empire (Catalogue general des antiquitis igyptiennes du Musie du Caire, Cairo, 1909), 1, 52 fif. The Karnak duplicate published by Ch. Kuentz in BIFAO, xxi (1923), 113-17. W.

He causes to turn back the Rebu, who had trodden
Egypt,
Great dread being in their hearts because of Egypt.
Their advanced guard abandoned their rear. Their
legs did not stop, except to run. Their archers abandoned
their bows. The heart of their runners was weak from
traveling. They untied their waterskins, thrown on the
ground; their packs were loosed and cast aside.
The wretched enemy prince of Rebu was fled in the
depth of the night, by himself. No feather was on his
head;5 his feet were unshod. His women were taken
before his face. The loaves for his provision were seized;
he had no water of the waterskin to keep him alive.
The face of his brethren was fierce, to slay him; among
his commanders one fought his companion. Their tents
were burned up, made ashes. All his goods were food
for the troops.6
He reached his (own) country, and he was in mourn
ing. Every survivor in his land was (too) aggrieved
(to) receive him. "The prince (whose) plume evil
fortune opposed!" they all say to him, those belonging
to his town.
"He is in the power of the gods, the lords of Memphis;
The Lord of Egypt makes a curse of his name:
'Merey7 is the abominated one of Memphis,
One and the son of one of his family to eternity.
Ba-en-Re Meri-Amon shall be in pursuit of his
children;
Mer-ne-Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat is given him as a
fate!'"
He is become a proverbial saying for Rebu; (10)
Generation says to generation of his victories:
"It was not done to us another time since (the days
of) Re!"
So he says, every old man, speaking to his son.
Woe to Rebu! They have ceased to live( in) the pleas
ant fashion of one who goes about in the field. Their
going is checked in a single day. The Tehenu are con
sumed in a single year, for Seth8 has turned his back upon
their chief; their settlements are abandoned on his ac
count. There is no work of carrying baskets in these days.
It is advantageous to hide, for one is safe in the cave.
The great Lord of Egypt is powerful; victory belongs
to him. Who can fight, knowing his unhindered stride ?
Foolish and witless is he who takes him on! He who
transgresses his frontier knows not for himself the
morrow. "As for Egypt," they say, "since (the time of) the
gods, (she has been) the sole daughter of Re, and his
son is he who is on the throne of Shu." No heart has
made a reputation for attacking her people, for the eye
of every god is in pursuit of him who covets her, and
5 Libyan warriors wore a feather in the headdress. 8 Plunder for the Egyptian troops. 7 The Libyan prince. 8 The Egyptians used their god Seth as a god of foreign peoples. 9 Egypt was thus the daughter of Re, and the pharaoh, who was by dogma the Son of Re, sat upon the throne of Shu, the air-god w h o was the direct divine son of Re.
S A N D P R A Y E R S 377
she it is who will carry off the end of her enemies."
So they say, those who watch the stars and who know
all their magic spells by looking at the winds.10 "A
great wonder has fallen to Egypt! He who attacked
her has been given (into) her hand as a living captive,
through the counsels of the divine king, righteous
against his enemies in the presence of Re."
Merey is he who did evil and subversive things against
every god who is in Memphis. He is the one (15)
with whom there was litigation in Heliopolis, and the
Ennead11 made him guilty because of his crimes. The
All-Lord has said: "Give the strong arm12 to my son,
the exact of heart, the merciful and kindly, Ba-en-Re
Meri-Amon, the one who is solicitous for Memphis,
who answers (on behalf of) Heliopolis, opening the
towns which had been shut up, that he might set free
many who had been imprisoned in every district, that
he might give offerings to the temples, that he might
cause incense to be brought in before the god, that he
might cause the great to possess their property (again),
that he might cause the poor to turn (again to) their
cities."
Thus speak the lords of Heliopolis about their son,
Mer-ne-Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat: "Give him a lifetime like
Re, that he may answer (on behalf of) him who is
suffering because of any country. Egypt has been
assigned to him to be the portion of him who represents
her, for himself forever, so that he might protect his
people. Behold, as one dwells in the time of the mighty
one, the breath of life comes immediately. The valiant
one, who causes goods to flow to the righteous man
there is no cheat who retains his plunder. He who
gathers the fat of wickedness and the strength of others
(shall have) no children." So they speak.
Merey, the wretched, ignorant enemy of Rebu, was
come to attack the "Walls of the Sovereign"1* the son
of whose lord has arisen in his place, the King of Upper
and Lower Egypt: Ba-en-Re Meri-Amon; the Son of
Re: Mer-ne-Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat. Ptah said about the
enemy of Rebu:14 "Gather together all his crimes, (20)
returned upon his (own) head. Give him into the hand
of Mer-ne-Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat, that he may make him
disgorge what he has swallowed, like a crocodile. Now
behold, the swift carries off the swift; the Lord, conscious
of his strength, will ensnare him. It is Amon who binds
him with his hand, so that he may be delivered to his
ka in Hermonthis; the King of Upper and Lower
Egypt: Ba-en-Re Meri-Amon; the Son of Re: Mer-ne
Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat."
Great joy has arisen in Egypt;
Jubilation has gone forth in the towns of Egypt.
10 T h e diviners by stars and winds see die evil eye of the gods as being against any of Egypt's attackers. 11 The Ennead, the nine gods of Heliopolis over whom Atum-Re presided, is here conceived to be judging Mer-ne-Ptah and die Libyan ruler Merey. In the following context, first Re, the All-Lord, gives his verdict and reward to the victorious pharaoh, and then the Ennead confirm this award. 12 The word may mean "scimitar." cf. n.i above. 13 Or the "Walls of (the god) Ta-tenen"? In either case, Memphis. 14 Karnak variant: " A m o n said about this one of Rebu."

They talk about the victories
Which Mer-ne-Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat made in Te
henu:
"How amiable is he, the victorious ruler!
How exalted is the king among the gods! How fortunate is he, the lord of command!
Ah, how pleasant it is to sit when there is gossip!"
One walks with unhindered stride on the way, for there is no fear at all in the heart of the people. The forts are left to themselves, the wells (lie) open, accessible to the messengers. The battlements of the wall are calm in the sun until their watchers may awake. The Madjoi are stretched out as they sleep; the Nau and Tekten are in the meadows as they wish.18 The cattle of the field are left as free to roam without herdsman, (even) crossing the flood of the stream. There is no breaking out of a cry in the night: "Halt! Behold, a comer comes with the speech of strangers!," (but) one goes and comes (25) with singing. There is no cry of people as when there is mourning. Towns are settled anew again. He who plows his harvest will eat it. Re has turned himself around (again) to Egypt. He was born as the one destined to be her protector, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Ba-en-Re MeriAmon; the Son of Re: Mer-ne-Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat.
The princes are prostrate, saying: "Mercy!"16 Not one raises his head among the Nine Bows. Desolation is for Tehenu; Hatti is pacified; Plundered is the Canaan with every evil; Carried off is Ashkelon; seized upon is Gezer; Yanoam is made as that which does not exist;17 Israel is laid waste, his seed is not;18 Hurra is become a widow for Egypt!19 All lands together, they are pacified; Everyone who was restless, he has been bound by the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Ba-en-Re MeriAmon; the Son of Re: Mer-ne-Ptah Hotep-hir-Maat, given life like Re every day.
Joy at the Accession of
Mer-ne-Ptah

18 The Madjoi were Sudanese used as police in Egypt. The word then came to mean "police." The Nau and Tekten policed the desert frontier.· 16 Or "Peace!" T h e Canaanite word shalam is used here. 17 Hatti was the land of the Hittites. Yanoam was an important town of northern Palestine. 18 Much has been made of the fact that the word Israel is the only one of the names in this context which is written with the determinative of people rather than land. Thus we should seem to have the Children of Israel in or near Palestine, but not yet as a settled people. This would have important bearing on the date of the Conquest. This is a valid argument. Determinatives should have meaning, and a contrast between determinatives in the same context should be significant. This stela does give the country determinatives to settled peoples like the Rebu, Temeh, Hatti, Ashkelon, etc., and the determinative of people to unlocated groups like the Madjoi, Nau, and Tekten. The argument is good, but not conclusive,

Joy at the Accession of
Ramses IV
It was normal in Egypt to affirm that the accession of any pharaoh was the restoration of the normal divine order. In the case of the accession of Ramses IV, there was an additional justification, in that the reign of Ramses III did end in palace disorder, including a conspiracy within the royal harem, see pp. 214-216. An ostracon in the Turin Museum, probably of the reign of Ramses IV (about 1164-1157 B.C.), published by G. Maspero in Recueil de travaux . . . , 11 (1880), 116-17; translated by Erman, LAE, 279. The following rendering benefits by a translation by W. Spiegelberg in OLZ, xxx (1927), 73-76.
A happy day! Heaven and earth are in joy, for thou art the great lord of Egypt
because of the notorious carelessness of Late-Egyptian scribes and several blunders of writing in this stela. The statement that the "seed," i.e. offspring, of Israel had been wiped out is a conventional boast of power at this period. 19 The land of the biblical Horites, or Greater Palestine.

T h e Egyptian concept of ma'at "truth, order, right," was of the essential order of the universe, given by the gods at the beginning and maintained and reconfirmed by the god-king. 8 Order is found in the regularity of times and seasons, restored by the new king.

A Prayer for Help in the

A characteristic of the later Empire was the humble submissiveness of a worshiper to his god. Man could achieve a good life only with the help of his god.

Gratitude for a God's Mercy
An artisan of the Nineteenth Dynasty here expresses his humble gratitude for the recovery of his son from illness. Neb-Re and his son Nakht-Amon were outline draftsmen of the Theban necropolis. It seems that Nakht-Amon acted impiously in respect to a cow belonging to the god Amon-Re and was then taken with a serious illness. He recovered after supplication had been made to the god. His father Neb-Re here gives pious thanks to Amon-Re. The inscription is carved on a memorial stela, now Berlin 20377.1 The text is published by G. Roeder in Aegyptische Inschriften aus den Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, 11 (Leipzig, 1924), 158 ff. A.

A Penitential Hymn
to a Goddess
The end of the Egyptian Empire produced a number of expressions of humble piety, unquestioning faith in a god, and penitence for wrongdoing. The following inscription was dedicated by a man of humble rank to a goddess, "Meres-ger, Lady of Heaven, Mistress of the T w o Lands, whose good name is Peak of the West." Meres-ger means "She Loves Silence," that is, pious submissiveness. The Peak of the West was probably her location on a mountain-head of western Thebes. We do not know what the transgression of the workman Nefer-abet was. This stela comes from Thebes and is now Turin Museum 102. It was published by G. Maspero in Recueil de travaux . . . , 11 (1880), 109, and studied by A. Erman, Denksteine aus der thebanischen Graberstadt (SBAW, 1911, 1086-1110). It was translated by B. Gunn in JEA, 111 (1916), 86-87.

Giving praise to the Peak of the West; kissing the
ground to her \a. I give praise; hear (my) call I was
a righteous man upon earth. Made by the Servant in the
Place of Truth,1 Nefer-abet, the triumphant, an ignorant
and widess man. I knew not good or evil. When I did the deed of
transgression against the Peak, she punished me, and I
was in her hand by night as well as day. I sat upon
the brick (s) like the pregnant woman.2 I called out
to the wind, (but) it did not come to me. I was
tormented by the Peak of the West, great in strength,
and by every god and every goddess. See, I shall say to great and small who are in the
gang:8 "Beware of the Peak! For a lion is in the Peak;
she smites with the smiting of a savage lion. She pursues
him who transgresses against her." (But) when I called to my mistress, I found her
coming to me with sweet breezes. She showed mercy
unto me, after she had let me see her hand. She turned
about to me in mercy; she made me forget the sickness
which had been (upon) me. Lo, the Peak of the West
is merciful, when one calls to her. What Nefer-abet, the triumphant, says. He says:
"See, and let every ear of him who lives upon earth
hearken:—Beware of the Peak of the West!"

Sumerian Petition
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Petition to a King
The following text represents an epistolary composition highly prized by the Babylonian scribes who developed it into a special literary genre. Quite a number of these "petitions" arc now extant. They take the form of a letter addressed to a king or deity; in the latter case the writer of the petition may be the king himself.1 In the text before us, an individual from Ur by the name of Urshagga probably addresses the petition letter to the king of Ur, whose name he unfortunately fails to mention. Three copies of this text have been found to date: two were excavated in the city of Erech, and one may come from Nippur. The latter was published by S. Langdon, Babylonian Liturgies (1913), No. 5; a transliteration and translation were published by the same author in BE, xxxi (1914), p. 25. Photographs of the two Erech tablets were published by A. Falkenstein together with an excellent transliteration, translation, and commentary, in ZA, XLIV (1936), 1-25. All three texts date from the first half of the second millennium B.C.
To my king with varicolored eyes who wears a lapis lazuli beard,2 Speak; To8 the golden statue fashioned on a good day,4
1 I n spite of their epistolary formulae, these "petitions" are, of course, not to be thought of as real letters forwarded by an individual who expects a letter in reply; they seem to be but another form of the "prayer" type of composition developed by the scribes in imitation of real letters with urgent appeal for help. As our text shows, in spite of their typical letter headings, these petitions are not written in prose; they have all the earmarks of Sumerian poetry. 2 As Falkenstein, Joe. cit., p. 8, n.2, states, representations of the bearded ox may be found illustrated in Leonard Woolley's Royal Tombs, Pis. 107, 109, and 110. 8 Falkenstein takes this "to" to refer to line 5 only (the Sumerian
The .. .5 raised in a pure sheepfold, called to the pure womb6 of Inanna,
The lord, hero of Inanna, say:
"Thou (in) thy judgment7 thou art the son of Anu,
Thy commands, like the word of a god, cannot be turned backj
Thy words like rain pouring down from heaven, are
without number,8
Thus says Urshagga, thy servant:
'My king has cared for me, who am a "son"
of Ur. (10)
If now my king is (truly) of Anu,"
Let not my father's house be carried off,10
Let not the foundations of my father's house be torn
away.
Let my king know.*""
construction is unfortunately ambiguous) and treats lines 3 and 4 as a parenthetical passage addressed to the king. 4 Perhaps, then, this petition is addressed to a dead, deified king of Ur whose statue was placed in the temple for veneration and worship. B T h e Sumerian word left untranslated here is db-za-za; its usual meanings are "monkey" and "sphinx." 6 The Sumerian word is ambiguous; it usually means "heart" but may also be rendered " w o m b , " cf. now particularly Jacobs«n, JNES, n ( 1 9 4 3 ) , 119-121. 7 For this rendering of the Sumerian word dim, cf. AS 12, p. 12, line 31. T h e sense of the line seems to be that this king's judgment is as trustworthy as that of a heavenly deity. 8 Note that the present translation differs to some extent from that of Falkenstein; the implications of the line are not too clear. " T h e implication of the words "of Anu" is not too clear; Falkenstein renders the line as: "As surely as my king is (the king) of Anu." 10 To judge from this and the next line, Urshagga seems to be pleading for the safety of his family in the most general terms. For the passive renderings in this passage, cf. BASOR, 79 ( 1 9 4 0 ) , p. 2 1 , n.5. 11 Presumably a phrase such as "this my plea" is to be understood.

After extolling the charms and virtues of the goddess, the hymn concludes by enumerating the blessings which she has bestowed upon the king, Ammiditana.

And the total of all peoples
She has decided to attach them to his yoke.

A prayer to be accompanied by a ritual of incantation. Ishtar, in her aspect as goddess of valor and of war, is addressed as the greatest of goddesses. The supplicant describes his bitter affliction and prays for a restoration of his prosperity, so that he and all who see him may praise and glorify the goddess. A colophon of the text indicates that it was the property of the temple Esagila in Babylon; and that it was copied from an older version at Borsippa. The extant text was written in the NeoBabylonian period as, in all probability, was the older text from which it was copied. Text: L. W. King, STC, 11, Pis. 75-84. Translations: ibid., 1, 222-37; A. Ungnad, Die Religion der Babylonier und Assyrer (Jena, 1921), 217-22; E. Ebeling, in AOT, 257-60.

I pray to thee, O Lady of ladies, goddess of goddesses.
O Ishtar, queen of all peoples, who guides mankind
aright,
O Irnini,1 ever exalted, greatest of the Igigi,2
O most mighty of princesses, exalted is thy name.
Thou indeed art the light of heaven and earth, O valiant daughter of Sin.
O supporter of arms, who determines battle,
O possessor of all divine power, who wears the crown
of dominion,
O Lady, glorious is thy greatness; over all the gods it
is exalted.
O star of lamentation, who causes peaceable brothers
to fight,
Yet who constantly gives friendship, (10)
O mighty one, Lady of battle, who suppresses the
mountains,
O Gushea,8 the one covered with fighting and clothed
with terror
Thou dost make complete judgment and decision, the
ordinances of heaven and earth.
Chapels, holy places, sacred sites, and shrines pay heed
to thee. Where is not thy name, where is not thy divine power ?
Where are thy likenesses not fashioned, where are thy
shrines not founded ?
Where art thou not great, where art thou not exalted?
Anu, Enlil, and Ea have made thee high; among the
gods they have caused thy dominion to be great
They have made thee high among all the Igigi; they
have made thy position pre-eminent.
At the thought of thy name heaven and earth
tremble. (20)
The gods tremble; the Anunnaki4 stand in awe.
To thine awesome name mankind must pay heed.
For thou art great and thou art exalted.
All the black-headed (people and) the masses of man
kind pay homage to thy might.
The judgment of the people in truth and righteousness
thou indeed dost decide.
Thou regardest the oppressed and mistreated; daily thou causest them to prosper.
Thy mercy! O Lady of heaven and earth, shepherdess of the weary people.
Thy mercy! O Lady of holy Eanna8 the pure storehouse.
Thy mercy! O Lady; unwearied are thy feet; swift are thy knees.
Thy mercy! O Lady of conflict (and) of all battles. (30) O shining one, lioness of the Igigi, subduer of angry
gods,
1 Another name of the goddess Ishtar, probably derived ultimately from Inanna, her Sumerian counterpart. 2 A collective name for the great gods of heaven. 8 Another name for the goddess Ishtar, sometimes appearing as A gushea, or Agushaya. 4 A collective name for the gods, not always used in the same sense. Sometimes it appears to mean all die gods of heaven and earth, sometimes the gods of the earth and the nether world, and again only the gods of the nether world. B Name of the temple of Inanna-Ishtar in Uruk, biblical Erech.
O most powerful of all princes, who holdest the reins
(over) kings,
(But) who dost release the bridles of all maidservants,
Who art exalted and firmly fixed, O valiant Ishtar, great
is thy might.
O brilliant one, torch of heaven and earth, light of all
peoples,
O unequaled angry one of the fight, strong one of the
battle,
O firebrand which is kindled against the enemy, which
brings about the destruction of the furious,
O gleaming one, Ishtar, assembler of the host,
0 deity of men, goddess of women, whose designs no
one can conceive,
Where thou dost look, one who is dead lives; one who
is sick rises up; (40)
The erring one who sees thy face goes aright
1 have cried to thee, suffering, wearied, and distressed,
as thy servant.
See me O my Lady; accept my prayers.
Faithfully look upon me and hear my supplication.
Promise my forgiveness and let thy spirit be appeased.
Pity! For my wretched body which is full of confusion
and trouble. Pity! For my sickened heart which is full of tears and
suffering.
Pity! For my wretched intestines (which are full of)
confusion and trouble.
Pity! For my afflicted house which mourns bitterly.
Pity! For my feelings which are satiated with tears and
suffering. (50)
O exalted Irnini, fierce lion,® let thy heart be at rest.
0 angry wild ox,6 let thy spirit be appeased.
Let the favor of thine eyes be upon me.
With thy bright features look faithfully upon me.
Drive away the evil spells of my body (and) let me
see thy bright light
How long, O my Lady, shall my adversaries be looking
upon me,
In lying and untruth shall they plan evil against me,
Shall my pursuers and those who exult over me rage
against me ?
How long, O my Lady, shall the crippled and weak
seek me out ?
One has made for me long sackcloth; thus I have
appeared before thee. (60)
The weak have become strong; but I am weak.
1 toss about like flood-water, which an evil wind makes
violent.
My heart is flying; it keeps fluttering like a bird of
heaven.
I mourn like a dove night and day.
I am beaten down, and so I weep bitterly.
With "Oh" and "Alas" my spirit is distressed.
I—what have I done, O my god and my goddess ?
Like one who does not fear my god and my goddess
I am treated;
6 In line 31 Ishtar is called a lioness, but here in her aspect of the fighting deity she is designated even as male ferocious animals.

While sickness, headache, loss, and destruction are provided for me; So are fixed upon me terror, disdain, and fullness of wrath, (70) Anger, choler, and indignation of gods and men. I have to expect, O my Lady, dark days, gloomy months, and years of trouble. I have to expect, O my Lady, judgment of confusion and violence. Death and trouble are bringing me to an end. Silent is my chapel; silent is my holy place; Over my house, my gate, and my fields silence is poured out. As for my god, his face is turned to the sanctuary of another. My family is scattered; my roof is broken up. (But) I have paid heed to thee, my Lady; my attention has been turned to thee. To thee have I prayed; forgive my debt. (80) Forgive my sin, my iniquity, my shameful deeds, and my offence. Overlook my shameful deeds; accept my prayer; Loosen my fetters; secure my deliverance; Guide my steps aright; radiantly like a hero let me enter the streets with the living. Speak so that at thy command the angry god may be favorable; (And) the goddess who has been angry with me may turn again. (Now) dark and smoky, may my brazier glow; (Now) extinguished, may my torch be lighted. Let my scattered family be assembled; May my fold be wide; may my stable be enlarged. (90) Accept the abasement of my countenance; hear my prayers. Faithfully look upon me and accept my supplication. How long, O my Lady, wilt thou be angered so that thy face is turned away ? How long, O my Lady, wilt thou be infuriated so that thy spirit is enraged ? Turn thy neck which thou hast set against me; set thy face [toward] good favor. Like the water of the opening up of a canal let thy emotions be released. My foes like the ground let me trample; Subdue my haters and cause them to crouch down under me. Let my prayers and my supplications come to thee. Let thy great mercy be upon me. (100) Let those who see me in the street magnify thy name. As for me, let me glorify thy divinity and thy might before the black-headed (people), [saying,] Ishtar indeed is exalted; Ishtar indeed is queen; The Lady indeed is exalted; the Lady indeed is queen. Irnini, the valorous daughter of Sin, has no rival.

Hymn to the Moon-God
A bilingual, Sumerian and Akkadian, text portraying the attributes and aspects of Sin, the god of the moon. Following the part of the text here translated there was a prayer; but this part of the text is so poorly preserved that it has not been thought worth-while to give the fragmentary translation. The tablet was found at the site of ancient Nineveh. The writing of the text may be dated to the reign of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, 668-633 B.C. The tablet states that it was copied from an older tablet; but the date of the original composition of the text cannot be determined. Text: Rawlinson (2d ed.), iv, 9. Translations: S. Langdon, Babylonian Penitential Psalms (OECT, vi), 6-11; E. Eliding in AOT, 241-2; Landsberger in E. Lehmann and H. Haas, Textbuch zur Religionsgeschichte (Leipzig, 1922), 301-3.

Begetter, merciful in his disposing,3 who holds in his
hand the life of the whole land,
O Lord, thy divinity fills the wide sea with awe, as well
as the distant heavens.
O progenitor of the land, who has founded temples, thou likewise dost give them their names.
O father begetter of gods and men, who founds shrines and establishes offerings,
Namer of kingships, giver of the scepter, thou dost determine destiny unto distant days.
O mighty prince whose deep heart no one of the gods
comprehends, Swift colt whose knees do not tire, who opens the way
for his brother gods,
1 The words "who in heaven and earth is exalted in his uniqueness," though not written at the ends of lines 2-9, are intended to be repeated after each of these lines as part of the refrain. Of the four proper names with which the god is addressed in lines 2-4, Nanna is the Sumerian name of the moon-god, Sin is his Akkadian counterpart, Anshar is a primitive father of the gods mentioned in the Babylonian Creation Epic, and Anu is the god of heaven and chief of all the gods. 2 Egishshirgal is the name of the temple of the moon-god in Ur. s So apparently the Sumerian; the Akkadian has "merciful and forgiving."

Prayer to the Moon-God
A prayer to accompany an offering made on the thirtieth day of the month, a festival of the Moon-god. This prayer belongs to the common type of prayers used with the ritual of su tl-la "raising of the hand." After a lengthy invocation of hymnic character, the supplicant prays for general well-being as well as for forgiveness of his sins. The text from which the translation is made comes from tablets found in the library of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, 668-633 B , c · F ° r duplicates see Walter G. Kunstmann, Die babylortische Gebetsbeschwdrung (Leipzig, 1932), 103. Text: L. W. King, Babylonian Magic and Sorcery (London, 1896), No. 1, lines 1-27. Translations: E. G. Perry, Hymnen und Gebete an Sin (Leipzig, 1907), 12-16; H. Zimmern, AO, XIXI/I (1911), 4-5.

Brilliant is thy torch like fire. . . . Thy brightness has filled the broad land. The people are radiant; they take courage at seeing thee.
Prayer of Ashurbanipal
to the Sun-God
This text is in reality a hymn of praise to the god Shamash, to which has been appended a prayer for the well-being of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, 668-633 B.C. This composition has a feature in its final lines which is unusual for hymns and prayers, but which is reminiscent of numerous royal inscriptions from very early times in Mesopotamia; a blessing is pronounced on whoever makes proper use of the piece, and a corresponding curse is added for its misuse. Duplicate copies of the text are preserved on two tablets found in the German excavations at Ashur. Text: E. Ebeling, KAR, Nos. 105, 361. Translations: E. Ebeling, Quellen zur Kenntnis der babylonischen Religion, MVAG, XXHI (1918), 1, 25-7; E. Ebeling in AOT, 247-8.
1 Thus the moon-god is identified with the chief god of the pantheon. 2 The name of the principal temple in Nippur. 8 These two lines stand after line 11 in the original text. They represent a later insertion in the text, which interrupts the sense awkwardly. I have ventured to transpose them to the present place in the translation, where I believe the interpolator intended them to stand. 4 A name of the moon-god meaning "bright rising." 5 The text has a mark of division in the midst of this line, at a point corresponding to the first semicolon in the translation. The probable meaning of this is that the line formed two separate lines in an earlier tablet from which our copy was made. 6 The personal deity mentioned two lines above.

1 Two words, tikip satakXi, which appear in the text at this point, are not included in the translation because they appear not to have formed part of the original composition. They probably constitute a note inserted by the scribe when he was copying the text from another tablet. Von Soden in ZDMG xci ( 1 9 3 7 ) , 193, and Thureau-Dangin in Textes mathematiques babyloniens (Leyden, 1938), xvii, have pointed out that satatyu is a loan word from Sumerian meaning a single " w e d g e " of cuneiform writing. The word ti\pu means "layer," "section," or " r o w . " T h e phrase here probably means, "a line of cuneiform writing." T h e most probable explanation is that the phrase was inserted here by the scribe to represent a line on his original which was damaged or for some reason was too obscure to be copied.

Hymn to the Sun-God
Shamash is praised as a universal god. He shines on all the earth and even on the nether world. He enjoys the worship and devotion of all types of mankind even those in foreign lands. Appearing alternately with this thought throughout the hymn is the proclamation of the sun-god's interest in justice and righteousness. He punishes the wicked and rewards the righteous. The text is made up out of many fragments, all found in the library of Ashurbanipal, 668-633 B.C. The best edition of the text is that of C. D. Gray, The SamaS Religious Texts (Chicago, 1901), Pis. 1-11, to which must be added, R. E. Briinnow, Assyrian Hymns, ZA, iv (1889), 25-35. Translations: P. A.

4 T h e word siddu appears to be borrowed from Sumerian S i d "reckoning," although it has not been recognized as such in the previous translations of this text, nor in the existing Akkadian dictionaries. T h e phrase epei liddi is an exact translation of Sumerian s i d a g "to render an account." 5 The word for "bag of weights" may also be translated "capital." 8 The translation is based on a restoration which is uncertain but probable. Such an interest rate is very common in Babylonian contracts; higher rates are also frequent.

T The Akkadian for "in an offering of . . ." is ina mal-da-ri Id. .. . This might also be read: ina mal-ta-ri id-[fa-ri] "in writing an inscription," The same word mal-da-ri, however, appears in line 11 below, where it seemscertain that it means "offering." 8 Literally: "those who make their mouth high." 9 Literally: "Thou dost hasten; thou dost loosen the issue of their mouth." 10 The word translated "king" means literally "sun" and is fundamentally the same word as the name of the sun-god. In this case the scribe has indicated by a phonetic complement that the word is to be read iamli·, elsewhere in the text he writes the name of the sun-god consistently without a phonetic complement even when it is grammatically in the genitive case. It is probable, then, that the sun-god is not meant here. Frankfort has pointed out in Kingship and the Gods, 307-8, that in Mesopotamia as well as in Egypt the king often bore the epithet "the sun." Such an interpretation of the text fits in well here with the general context.
Thou dost open the ears of the whole world.

thou dost receive.
Those whom .. . and flood surround thou indeed dost
spare;
Their bright, pure outpourings thou dost accept.
Thou dost drink their mixture, the wine;
The wishes which they conceive thou indeed dost cause
to be realized. (50)
Those who are submissive—thou dost release their bans;
Those who do homage—thou dost accept their prayers.
They then fear thee; they honor thy name;
They praise thy greatness forever.
The foolish of tongue who speak evil,
Who, like clouds, have no face or countenance,

Those who traverse the wide earth,
Those who tread upon the high mountains,
The monsters of the sea which are full of terror,
The product of the sea (and) what belongs in the Deep,
The spawn of the river which it produces from itself,
(all) O Shamash, are in thy presence.
Which are the mountains that have not clothed them
selves with thy brilliance ?
Which are the world regions that do not warm them
selves by the glow of thy light ?
O brightener of gloom, who makes darkness to shine,
O opener of darkness, who makes the broad earth to
shine,
Who makes the day bright (and) sends down burning
heat on the earth in the midday, (10)
Who like a fire heats the broad earth,
Who makes days short, who makes nights long,

Psalm to Marduk
The one purpose of this composition is to establish a quiet and favorable mood in the god Marduk, when he is returned to his temple, after a long ceremony known as the Akitu, or New Year's Festival. To this end the principal temples where he is worshiped, and all the main gods are invoked, and asked to say to him, "Be appeased." This word is common to three slightly different refrains which run throughout the composition, at the ends of the lines. The most complete copy of the text is from a tablet found at Babylon. Other copies existed at Nineveh, and fragments of two of them are known from the time of Ashurbanipal, 668-633 B.C. The Babylonian text is said to have been copied from an older tablet. To judge from the name of the scribe, Bel-ahhim-iribam, this was done in NeoBabylonian times. The date of the original composition can not be determined. It appears to have been written in Sumerian.

2 It is intended that the first eleven lines should all end with the same refrain as line 1, although the text actually gives only the first word of the refrain in 2-11. 8 One of the "Fifty Names" of Marduk listed in the seventh tablet of the Babylonian Creation Epic. 4 The name of the chief temple of Marduk, located in Babylon and known from Old Babylonian times until the Hellenistic period. 8 Although there was a chapel in the temple of Esagila known as Ezida, it is not probable that it is meant here; more likely the reference is to the great temple in Borsippa. It is true that Ezida of Borsippa was a temple of Nabu, but it is not inappropriate to call Marduk, the chief of the gods in Neo-Babylonian times, the "Lord of Ezida," especially since he seems to have been associated with this temple even as early as the time of Hammurabi. β A principal sanctuary in the temple of Ezida at Borsippa. τ The refrain is now augmented by the words, "How long?" and continues in this form through line 28, although in its written form it appears only represented by the first word. " H o w long?" is an abbreviated exclamation, meaning, "How long will you remain in your present state? Is it not time for a change?"

Prayer to the Gods of the Night
The occasion for this prayer is a divination ceremony carried on at night. The great gods who ordinarily control the affairs of the world are regarded as resting in deep; and therefore the gods represented by several of the constellations of fixed stars are asked to witness the performance and to guarantee that truth will be revealed. The place from which this text comes is not known, but it was written in the Old Babylonian period, in the first half of the second millennium B.C. It is written in the Akkadian language and the Babylonian cursive script. T w o slighdy variant copies of the text are known, one of which is on a tablet giving two additional prayers of similar nature. These latter are not given here because they are somewhat fragmentary. Text A: V. K. Shileiko, Izvestija Rossijs\oj
8 The refrain is written out in full in this line because it is the first line on the reverse of the tablet. ' T h e historic temple of Enlil in the city of Nippur. Since Marduk in Neo-Babylonian theology had been assigned the position that Enlil once held it is quite in order to say that he dwells in Ekur. 10 After two lines (29-30) without a refrain, the response now assumes its third form and continues so to the end. 11 The original composition seems to have ended here; but the Assyrian copy adds the following prayer: "Make Ashurbanipal, the shepherd, thy sustainer, to live; hear his prayer; lay well the foundation of the seat of his royalty; the control of the people let him hold unto distant days."

Prayer to Every God
This prayer is addressed to no particular god, but to all gods in general, even those who may be unknown. The purpose of the prayer is to claim relief from suffering, which the writer understands is the result of some infraction of divine law. He bases his claim on the fact that his transgressions have been committed unwittingly, and that he does not even know what god he may have offended. Moreover, he claims, the whole human race is by nature ignorant of the divine will, and consequendy is constandy committing sin. He therefore ought not to be singled out for punishment. The text is written in the Emesal dialect of Sumerian, furnished with an interlinear Akkadian translation. The colophon of the tablet indicates that it was part of a series of prayers, the next tablet of which began with the line "By his word he has commanded my well-being." The tablet comes from the library of Ashurbanipal, 668-633 B-c·» a n d was copied from an older original. There are, however, numer

T h e reference in both cases is probably to tradespeople. W h e n a trader entered a town he was frequently haled into court to settle some legal matter connected with his transactions. 8 B has "truth" instead of "fatherless." 7 This line in B is transposed to stand after line 20. 8 The fire-god.

Prayer of Pudu-hepas1 to the
Sun-Goddess of Arinna
and her Circle

A. PRAYER TO T H E SUN-GODDESS HERSELF
To the Sun-goddess of Arinna, my lady, the mistress
of the Hatti lands, the queen of heaven and earth. Sun-goddess of Arinna, thou art queen of all coun
tries! In the Hatti country thou bearest the name of the
Sun-goddess of Arinna; (5) but in the land which thou
madest the cedar land thou bearest the name Hebat.
I, Pudu-hepas, am a servant of thine from of old, a heifer
from thy stable, a foundation stone (upon which)
thou (canst rest). Thou, my lady, rearedst me (10) and
Hattusilis, thy servant, to whom thou espousedst me,
was closely associated with the Storm-god of Nerik, thy
beloved son. The place in which thou, Sun-goddess
of Arinna, my lady, didst establish us was the residence
(15) of the Storm-god of Nerik, thy beloved son. How
the earlier kings had neglected it, that thou knowest,
Sun-goddess of Arinna, my lady. The earlier kings let
[fall into ruins] even those countries which thou, Sun
goddess of Arinna, my lady, hadst given them. (Small gap in which Hattusilis' achievements during
the reign of his brother Muwatallis were related.) [When he was king in] the country of Nerik and
in the country of [Hakpis], he himself and his [soldiery
kept in the field] while he (Muwatallis) waged war
against [Egypt]. But when Muwatallis, [his brother,] became god,2
he (Hattusilis) took his [son] Urhi-Tessub (40) and
established him as king. How [Urhi-Tessub limited]
Hattusilis, thy servant, to Nerik, that thou knowest,
Sun-goddess of Arinna, my lady. How he harried his
lord, and (how) they rallied the princes (with the call):
"Come! To Nerik!" [that thou kno]west [Sun-goddess
of Arinna, my lady]. That man* counted its ruin and
its doom as naught: "Let there be death in Nerik!
Let us throw Nerik into ruin!"
(small gap)
[In the way in which it is right to perform purifi
cations, in the way in which ye want to be worshiped,
1 Hittite queen and consort of Hattusilis, the son of Mursilis. 2 i.e. died. s Urhi-Tessub is meant; the expression is derogatory.
in the way in which it is right to attend to your festivals]
(ii) [thus] we shall perform the purifications, thus we
shall worship you the gods, thus we shall attend to the
ordinances (and) celebrations due to you, the gods.
(5) The festivals of you, the gods, which they had
stopped, the old festivals, the yearly ones and the
monthly ones, they shall celebrate for you, the gods.
Your festivals, O gods, my lords, shall never be stopped
again! For all our days will we, your servant (and)
your handmaid, (10) worship you. This is what I, Pudu-hepas, thy handmaid, laid in
prayer before the Sun-goddess of Arinna, my lady, the
lady of the Hatti lands, the queen of heaven and earth.
Sun-goddess of Arinna, my lady, yield to me, hearken
to me! (15) Among men there is a saying: "To a
woman in travail the god yields her wish." [Since] I,
Pudu-hepas, am a woman in travail (and since) I have
devoted myself to thy son, yield to me, Sun-goddess
of Arinna, my lady! (20) Grant to me what [I ask]!
Grant life to [Hattusilis, thy serv]ant! Through [the
Good-women] (and) the Mother-goddesses [long (and)
enduring] years (and) days shall be [gi]ven to him.
[Since] thou, an exalted deity, holdest [a place set
apart among the gods], (25) all the gods are [sub
servient to thee], and no one appeals [to thee in vain].
In [the assembly] of all the gods request thou the life
[of Hattusilis]! May [thy] request (30) be received
with favor! Because thou, [Sun-goddess] of Arinna,
my [lady], hast shown favor to me and (because) the
[g]ood of [the land] and of its realm [is close to thy
heart], thou shalt enjoy the reverent [worship] of
[my fam]ily. Where[as I have now pacified] thy soul,
Sun-goddess of Arinna, my lady, (35) hearken to what
ever I lay before thee in prayer on [this] day! [Do
something] for this cause! Let not the gods re[ject my]
request!

B. PRAYER TO LELWANIS4
. . . (iii) Hattusilis, that servant of thine, who [is ill]. (15) In the presence of Sum[ ], the physician, they spoke charms over him [ . . . ] . If [Hattusilis is accur]sed, and if Hattusilis, [my husband], has become [hateful] in the eyes of you, the gods; or (if) anyone of the gods above or below has taken offence at him; or (if) anyone has made an offering to the gods (20) to bring evil upon Hattusilis—accept not those evil words, O goddess, my lady! Let evil not touch Hattusilis, thy servant! (25) O gods, prefer not [our] advers[aries],
4 This is probably the Hittite pronunciation of the name which is otherwise spelled "Ishtar" of Samuha; she was Hattusilis' special patroness.

goddess, my lady, wilt grant him life and relay to the

wilt tread under foot the evil words and shut them out

servant, and of Pudu-hepas, thy handmaid, come forth
from thy mouth in the presence of the gods! To Hat
tusilis, thy servant, and to Pudu-hepas, thy handmaid,
(35) 8*ve long years, months and days! And if thou, Lelwanis, my lady, relayest the good
(word) to the gods, grantest life to thy servant Hat
tusilis, (and) givest him long years, months (and)
days, I will go (and) make for Lelwanis, my lady, (40)
a silver statue of Hattusilis—as tall as Hattusilis him
self, with its head, its hands (and) its feet of gold
moreover I will hang it (with ornaments).
C. PRAYER TO ZINTUHIS
O Zintuhis, my lady, beloved granddaughter of the
Storm-god and of the Sun-goddess of Arinna! Thou art
the pectoral (45) of the Storm-god and of the Sun
goddess of Arinna; they continually look at thee. (small gap)
(iv) [In this matter], Zintuhis, my lady, [prove] thy
divine power! Before the Storm-god, thy grandfather,
(5) [and before] the Sun-goddess of Arinna, thy grand
mother, bring (the request) [of Ha]ttusilis, thy servant,
for life and long years! Let that come forth from their
mouth! [And] if thou, Zintuhis, my lady, wilt [hear]ken to
these words and relay them to the Storm-god, thy
grandfather, (10) [and] to the Sun-goddess of Arinna,
thy grandmother, [then] I will make a [grea]t ornament
for thee, Zintuhis, my lady.
D. PRAYER TO MEZZULLAS
O Mezzullas, my lady! Thou art the beloved daughter
of the Storm-god [and] of the Sun-goddess of Arinna.
(15) Whatever thou, Mezzullas, my lady, sayest [to]
the Storm-god, thy father, and to the Sun-goddess of
Arinna, thy mother, [to that] they will hearken; they
will not reject it. These words which [I], Pudu-hepas,
thy handmaid, have laid in [pray]er before the Storm
god, thy father, and the Sun-goddess of Arinna, thy
mother, (20) announce them, Mezzullas, my lady,
and convey them to the Storm-god, thy father, [and
to the Sun-goddess of Arinn]a, thy mother! [And if thou, Mezzullas, my lady, wilt hearken to
these] words [and convey them to the Storm-god, thy
father, and to the Sun-goddess of Arinna, thy mother],
(25) [then I will make . . . ] and present (it) to
Mezzullas, my lady, [ . . . ] .
E. PRAYER TO THE STORM-GOD OF ZIPPALANDA
[O Storm-god of Zippalan]da, my lord! Thou art
the beloved son [of the Storm-god and of the Sun-] god
dess of Arinna. Announce [my words to the Storm
god, thy father,] and to the Sun-goddess of Arinna,
thy mother! (30) The Storm-god, thy father, (and)
the Sun-goddess of Arinna, thy mother, will [not
re]ject thy word, they will hearken to thee. This
[word], which I, Pudu-hepas, thy handmaid, have
sp[oken] in prayer, announce and relay thou (to thy
parents), Storm-god of Zippalanda, my lord! O god,
my lord, (35) yield to this word of mine! Because as
a woman in travail I have in my own person made
reparation to the god, my lord, intercede for me, god,
my lord, with the Storm-god, thy father, and the Sim
goddess of Arinna, thy mother! Hattusilis, thy servant,
wore himself out in the god's service; he gave himself
body and soul (40) to the restoration of Nerik, the
beloved city of the god, my lord. So be thou, O god, my
lord, favorably inclined toward Hattusilis, thy servant!
These words, which I lay in prayer before the Storm
god, thy father, (45) and the Sun-goddess of Arinna,
thy mother—convey them (to thy parents) for me, O
Storm-god of Zippalanda, my lord!
And if thou, Storm-god of Zippalanda, my lord, wilt
convey these words to the Storm-god, thy father, and
to the Sun-goddess of Arinna, thy mother, and thereby
wilt [deliver] Hattusilis from evil, (edge) then I will
make [for thee . . . ] (and) a golden shield weighing
x minas; I will make [for thee . . . ] and the . . . for the

Plague Prayers of Mursilis1

1. Haitian Storm-god, my lord, and ye, Hattian gods,
my lords! Mursilis, the great king, your servant, has
sent me (with the order:) Go! To the Hattian Storm
god, my lord, and to the gods, my lords, speak as
follows: What is this that ye have done? A plague ye have
let into the land. The Hatti land has been cruelly
afflicted by the plague. For twenty years now men have
been dying in my father's days, in my brother's days,
and in mine own since I have become the priest of
the gods. When men are dying in the Hatti land like
this, the plague is in no wise over. As for me, the agony
of my heart and the anguish of my soul I cannot endure
any more. 2. When I celebrated festivals, I worshiped all the
gods, I never preferred one temple to another. The
matter of the plague I have laid in prayer before all
the gods making vows to them (and saying): "Hearken
to me, ye gods, my lords! Drive ye forth the plague
from the Hatti land! The reason for which people are
dying in the Hatti land—either let it be established by
1Hittite king, son of Suppiluliumas; about third quarter of the 14th century B.C.



HITTITE
«
an omen, or let me see it in a dream, or let a prophet
declare it!" But the gods did not hearken to me and
the plague got no better in the Hatti land. The Hatti
land was cruelly afflicted.
3. The few people who were left to give sacrificial
loaves and libations were dying too. Matters again got
too much for me. So I made the anger of the gods
the subject of an oracle. I learnt of two ancient tablets.
The first tablet dealt with the offerings to the river
Mala.2 The old kings had regularly presented offerings
to the river Mala. But now a plague has been rampant
in the Hatti land since the days of my father, and we
have never performed the offerings to the river Mala.
4. The second tablet concerned Kurustama. When the
Hattian Storm-god had brought people of Kurustama*
to the country of Egypt and had made an agreement
concerning them with the Hattians so that they were
under oath to the Hattian Storm-god—although the
Hattians as well as the Egyptians were under oath to
the Hattian Storm-god, the Hattians ignored their
obligations; the Hattians promptly broke the oath of
the gods. My father sent foot soldiers and charioteers
who attacked the country of Amka,4 Egyptian territory.
Again he sent troops, and again they attacked it. When
the Egyptians became frightened, they asked outright
for one of his sons to (take over) the kingship. But
when my father gave them one of his· sons, they killed
him as they led him there. My father let his anger run
away with him, he went to war against Egypt and
attacked Egypt. He smote the foot soldiers and the
charioteers of the country of Egypt. The Hattian Storm
god, my lord, by his decision even then let my father
prevail; he vanquished and smote the foot soldiers and
the charioteers of the country of Egypt. But when
they brought back to the Hatti land the prisoners which
they had taken a plague broke out among the prisoners
and they began to die. 5. When they moved the prisoners to the Hatti land,
these prisoners carried the plague into the Hatti land.
From that day on people have been dying in the
Hatti land. Now, when I found that tablet dealing with
the country of Egypt, I made the matter the subject
of an oracle of the god (and asked): "Those arrange
ments which were made by the Hattian Storm-god
namely that the Egyptians and the Hattians as well
were put under oath by the Hattian Storm-god, that
the Damnassaras deities were present in the temple of
the Hattian Storm-god, and that the Hattians promptly
broke their word—has this perhaps become the cause
of the anger of the Hattian Storm-god, my lord?"
And (so) it was established.
6. Because of the plague, I made the offerings to the
river Mala the subject of an oracle also. And in that
matter too it was established that I should have to
account for myself before the Hattian Storm-god.
2 A river marking the eastern frontier of Hittite dominated territory and separating it from the Hurri kingdom. 3 A city in the Kashkean country of northern Anatolia. T h e purpose for which these people were sent to Egypt is not known to us. 4 The region between Lebanon and Antilibanus.
P R A Y E R S 395
See now! I have admitted my guilt before the Storm-god
(and said): "It is so. We have done it." I know for
certain that the offence was not committed in my days,
that it was committed in the days of my father. . . .
But, since the Hattian Storm-god is angry for that
reason and people are dying in the Hatti land, I am
(nevertheless) making the offerings to the Hattian
Storm-god, my lord, on that account. 7. 'Because I humble myself and cry for mercy,
hearken to me, Hattian Storm-god, my lord! Let the
plague stop in the Hatti land! 8. The reasons for the plague that were established
when I made the matter the subject of a series of
oracles, these have I removed. I have made [ample]
restitution. The matter of the (broken) oath which
was established (as a cause) in connection with the
plague, offerings for those oaths I have made to the
Hattian Storm-god, my lord. I have also made (offer
ings) [to the other gods]. The offerings have been
presented to thee, Hattian Storm-god, my lord; the
offerings have been presented to them too. (As for)
the offerings to the river Mala that were established
(as a cause) in connection with the plague—since I
am now on my way to the river Mala, acquit me of
that offering to the river Mala, O Hattian Storm-god
my lord, and ye gods, my lords! The offering to the
river Mala I promise to make, I promise to complete
it properly. The reason for which I make it—namely
the plague—O gods, my lords, take pity on me and let
that plague abate in the Hatti land! 9. Hattian Storm-god, my lord, (and) ye gods, my
lords! It is only too true that man is sinful. My father
sinned and transgressed against the word of the Hattian
Storm-god, my lord. But I have not sinned in any
respect. It is only too true, however, that the father's
sin falls upon the son. So, my father's sin has fallen
upon me. Now, I have confessed before the Hattian
Storm-god, my lord, and before the gods, my lords
(admitting): "It is true, we have done it." And because
I have confessed my father's sin, let the soul of the
Hattian Storm-god, my lord, and (those) of the gods,
my lords, be again pacified! Take pity on me and drive
the plague out of the Hatti land! Suffer not to die the
few who are still left to offer sacrificial loaves and liba
tions!
10. See! I lay the matter of the plague before the
Hattian Storm-god, my lord. Hearken to me, Hattian
Storm-god, and save my life! This is of what I [have
to remind] thee: The bird takes refuge in (its) nest,
and the nest saves its life. Again: if anything becomes
too much for a servant, he appeals to his lord. His lord
hears him and takes pity on him. Whatever had become
too much for him, he sets right for him. Again: if
the servant has incurred a guilt, but confesses his guilt
to his lord, his lord may do with him whatever he
pleases. But, because (the servant) has confessed his
guilt to his lord, his lord's soul is pacified, and his
lord will not punish that servant. I have now confessed

my father's sin. It is only too true, I have done it.
If there is to be restitution, it seems clear that with all
the gifts that have already been given because of this
plague, with all the prisoners that have been brought
home, in short with all the restitution that Hattusa
has made because of the plague, it has already made
restitution twentyfold. And yet the soul of the Hattian
Storm-god, my lord, and of the (other) gods, my lords,
is not pacified. But, if ye demand from me additional
restitution, tell me of it in a dream and I will give it
to you.
11. See! I am praying to thee, Hattian Storm-god, my
lord. So save my life! If indeed it is for those reasons
which I have mentioned that people are dying,—as
soon as I set them right, let those that are still able
to give sacrificial loaves and libations die no longer!
If, on the other hand, people are dying for some other
reason, either let me see it in a dream, or let it be
found out by an oracle, or let a prophet declare it, or
let all the priests find out by incubation whatever I
suggest to them. Hattian Storm-god, my lord, save
my life! Let the gods, my lords, prove their divine
power! Let someone see it in a dream! For whatever
reason people are dying, let that be found out!... Hat
tian Storm-god, my lord, save my life! Let this plague
abate again in the Hatti land!

What is this, O gods, that ye have done? A plague
ye have let into the land. The Hatti land, all of it, is
dying; so no one prepares sacrificial loaves and libations
for you. The plowmen who used to work the fields of
the god are dead; so no one works or reaps the fields of
the god at all. The grinding women who used to make
the sacrificial loaves for the gods are dead; so they
do not make the sacrificial loaves any longer. From
whatever corral (or) sheepfold they used to select
the sacrifices of sheep and cattle, the cowherds and
the shepherds are dead and the corral [and the sheep
fold are empty]. So it comes to pass that the sacrificial
loaves (and) libations, and the offerings of animals
have stopped. And ye, O gods, come on this day and
hold us responsible. Man has lost his wits, and there
is nothing that we do aright. O gods, whatever sin
you behold, either let a prophet rise and declare it,
or let the sibyls or the priests learn about it by in
cubation, or let man see it in a dream!... O gods, take
ye pity again on the Hatti land! On the one hand
it is afflicted with a plague, on the other hand it is
afflicted with hostility. The protectorates beyond the
frontier, (namely) the Mitanni land (and) the Arzawa
land, each one has rebelled; they do not acknowledge
the gods and have broken the oaths of the gods. They
persist in acting maliciously against the Hatti land,
and the temples(?) of the gods they seek to despoil.
Let the gods take an interest therein again! Send ye the
plague, hostility, famine (and) evil fever into the
Mitanni land and the Arzawa land! Rested are the
rebellious countries, but the Hatti land is a weary land.
Unhitch the weary, but the rested harness!
Moreover, those countries which belong to the Hatti
land, (namely) the Kashkean country (they are swine
herds and weavers of linen), also the country of
Arawanna, the country of Kalasma, the Lukka country,
the country of Pitassa—these lands have also renounced
the Sun-goddess of Arinna. They cast off their tributes
and began to attack the Hatti land in their turn. In
olden days the Hatti land with the help of the Sun
goddess of Arinna used to take on the surrounding
countries like a lion. Moreover, cities like Halba (and)
Babylon that it would destroy—from all such countries
they took goods, silver (and) gold, and their gods and
placed them before the Sun-goddess of Arinna. But now all the surrounding countries have begun to
attack the Hatti land. Let it again become a matter of
concern to the Sun-goddess of Arinna! O god, bring
not thy name into disrepute! Whatever rage (or) anger the gods may feel, and
whosoever may not have been reverent toward the gods,
—let not the good perish with the wicked! If it is one
town, or one [house], or one man, O gods, let that
one perish alone! Look ye upon the Hatti land with
favorable eyes, but the evil plague give to [those other]
countries!
Daily Prayer of the King
Texts: KUB, xxiv, 1-4 and the additional pieces KUB, xxx, 12 and 13. Literature: The hymn of section b. is translated in the following places: H. Ehelolf, Berichte aus den preussischen Kunstsammlungen, x u x (1928), 32-34; E. Forrer, Reattexil(on der Assyriologie, 1 (1929), 149 f.; A. Götze, Kulturgeschichte Kleinasiens (1933), 128. The whole composition was treated by O. R. Gurney in AAA, XXVII (1940), 3-163. In part of the texts the addressed deity is the Sun-goddess of Arinna, in another part Telepinus. The latter version has been adopted here.
Entreaty
The scribe reads this tablet addressing the deity daily;
he praises the deity (saying):
Telepinus, a mighty (and) noble deity art thou.
Mursilis, the king, thy servant, and the queen, (5) thy
handmaid, have sent me (with the request): "Go! en
treat Telepinus, our lord, the guardian of our persons!" Whether thou art in heaven above among the gods,
noble Telepinus; whether gone to the sea or to the
mountains (10) to roam; whether gone to war to the
country of the enemynow let the sweet and soothing cedar essence lure
thee! Come home into thy temple! Here I am entreat
ing thee with sacrificial loaves and libations, (15) allow
thyself to be lured forth! Let me speak to thee alone
and whatever I say unto thee—lend me thine ear, O
god, and hearken to it!
Thou, Telepinus, art a noble god; thy godhead and
the gods' temples are firmly established in the Hatti
land. But (20) in no other land anywhere are they so.



HITTITE
«
Festivals (and) sacrifices pure (and) holy they present to thee in the Hatti land. But in no other country anywhere do they present them so. (25) Lofty temples adorned with silver and gold thou hast in the Hatti land. But in no other country anywhere hast thou their like, (ii) Cups (and) rhyta, silver, gold and (precious) stones thou hast in the Hatti land. But in no other country hast thou their like.
Festivals too—the festival of the month, the festivals of the new year, the ceremonies of winter and, spring, (5) and of the summer, the festivals of entreaty—men celebrate for thee in the Hatti land. But in no other country anywhere do they celebrate their like. Thy divinity, O Telepinus, (10) is honored in the Hatti land, and Mursilis, the king, thy servant, and the queen, thy handmaid, and also the princes, thy servants, are reverent toward thee in the Hatti land. They undertake the celebration of communion feasts, sacrifices and festivals for thee, Telepinus. (15) Everything they present to thee is holy (and) pure. Moreover, reverence is paid to thy temple, thy rhyta, [thy cups] (and) thy utensils and they are cared for scrupulously. To the utensils [of thy worship] no one draws near.
Hymn1
Thou, Telepinus, art a noble god; (30) thy name is noble among names. Thy godhead is noble among the gods; among the gods art thou noble, O Telepinus. Great art thou, O Telepinus; there is no other deity more noble and mighty than thou. Of sure (35) judgment thou art lord; thou watchest over kingship in heaven and on earth. Thou settest the bounds of the lands; thou hearkenest to entreaties. Thou, Telepinus, art a merciful god; (40) thou art forever showing thy mercy. The godly man is dear to thee, O Telepinus, and thou, Telepinus, dost exalt him. In the orbit of heaven and earth thou, Telepinus, art the (source of) light; (45) throughout the lands art thou a god who is celebrated. Of every land thou art father (and) mother; the inspired lord of judgment art thou. In the place of judgment thou art untiring; among the Olden Gods thou art (50) the one who is celebrated. For the gods thou, Telepinus, assignest the rites; to the Olden Gods thou assignest their portions. For thee they open the door of heaven; thou, the celebrated Telepinus, (35) art allowed to pass through the gate of heaven.2 The gods of heaven are obedient to thee, O Telepinus; the gods of the earth are obedient to thee, O Telepinus. Whatever thou sayest, O Telepinus, the gods bow down to thee. Of the oppressed, the orphan and the widow thou art father (and) mother; the cause of the orphan, the oppressed thou, Telepinus, dost take to heart.

ascends to the roof and offers it to the Sim-god of

Prayer of Kantuzilis for Relief

O Sun-god, when thou goest down to the nether world
(to be) with him, forget not to speak with that patron
god of mine and (5) apprise him of Kantuzilis' plight!1
0 god, ever since my mother gave birth to me, thou,
my god, hast reared me. Thou, my god, (art) my
[refuge] and my anchor.2 Thou, [my god], broughtest

me what to do in time of distress. [Thou], my god,

didst call [me], Kantuzilis, thy favorite servant. (10)
The superior power of my god that I have not known
since childhood [must 1 experience] it \in my old age}~\
Even when I fared well, I always acknowledged the
superior power (and) the wisdom of my god. Never
have I sworn in thy name, my god, and then broken
the oath afterward. That which is holy to my god and
hence not fit for me to eat, never have I eaten it. I have
not brought impurity upon my body. (15) Never have I withheld from thy stable an ox;
never have I withheld from thy fold a sheep. When
ever I came upon food, I never ate it indiscriminately;
whenever I came upon water, I never drank it indis
criminately. Were I now to recover, would I not have
recovered at the word of thee, my god ? Were I to re
gain my strength, would I not have regained it at the
word of thee, my god ? (20) Life is bound up with death, and death is bound
up with life. Man cannot live for ever; the days of his
life are numbered. Were man to live for ever, it would
not concern him greatly even if he had to endure
grievous sickness. Would that my god might now freely open his heart
(and) soul to me and [tell] me my fault (25) so that
I might learn about it! Either let my god speak to me
in a dream! Would that my god would open his heart
to me and tell [me] my [fau]lt so that I might learn
about it! Or let the sibyl tell me, [or] let the Sun-god's
seer tell [me] from the liver (of a sheep). Would that
my god might freely open [his heart (and) his soul] to
me and tell me my fault so that I might learn about it! O my god! Let me know how to improve on your
worship! (rev.) of all [men] the shepherd art thou. It
has always been said about thee [that thou... ]. My god
who was angry at me and rejected me—let the same
(god) care for me again and grant me life! Would that
my god, who for[sook] me, [might take] pity on me!
[Much as] I wearied myself with pleading before my
god, it is yet of no avail. (5) No sooner didst thou scrape
[one thing evi]l off [me], than thou broughtest back
[another] in its stead. Would that [the Sun-god] might calm down again
and that peace might return to his heart! Would that
he might raise me up again out of my affliction. [O
Sun-god], . . . , [the favorite son of] Sin and Ningal8
art thou. See! I, Kantuzilis, thy servant, have asked for
[mercy] and humbled myself. [See!] I am beseeching
thee. (10) To the Sun-god I sing. See! I, Kantuzilis, implore
my god incessantly. Would that my god might hearken
[to me]! Whenever in times past I, Kantuzilis, per
formed the cult of my god, whenever I . . . [ . . . ]ed
to my god, thou gavest me abundance, thou gavest me
strength. But now when I, Kantuzilis, performed the
cult for thee with the merchant, a mortal, holding
the balance for the Sun-god and upsetting the balance
what [wrong] did I do to my god ?

A DISPUTE OVER SUICIDE
This remarkable text carries the argument between a man who is weary of this life and his own soul. Since he finds life unbearable, the man contemplates suicide. His soul vacillates, first agrees, then fears that suicide will entail the danger that the man will have no mortuary service from his survivors, then proposes an abandonment to a life of careless pleasures, and finally agrees to remain with the man in any case. The text dates from the Middle Kingdom, or, more probably, from the disturbed times between the Old and Middle Kingdoms (end of the third millennium B.C.), when the established order of life had broken down and men were groping for new values. Berlin Papyrus 3024 was published by A. Erman, Gespräch eines Lebensmüden mit seiner Seele (APAW, 1896, 2). A transcription of much of the text into hieroglyphic appears in K, Sethe, Aegyptische Lesestiicl(e (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1928), 43-46. It has been studied by A. Scharff, in German in SB A W, 1937, 9, by R. Weill, in French in BIFAO, XLV (1946), 89-154, and in Dutch by A. de Buck in Kernmomenten. "Ex Oriente Lux"—Mededeelingen en Verhandelingen, No. 7, (Leyden, 1947), 19-32. It was translated in Erman, LAE, 86-92. The beginning of the manuscript is lost. The translation starts with the man's answer to a previous argument by his soul.·
I opened my mouth to my soul, that I might answer
what it had said: "This is too much for me today, that
my soul no (longer) talks with me.1 It is really too
great to be exaggerated. It is like abandoning me. Let
[not] my soul go away; it should wait for me because
o f . . . It will not (10) thereby succeed in escaping from
the day of misfortune. Behold, my soul wrongs me,
(but) I do not listen to it, and draws me on toward
death before (I) have come to it and casts (me) upon
the flame to burn me u p . . . . (15) May it be near to me
on the day of misfortune and wait on that side . . . O
my soul, who art too stupid to subdue wretchedness over
life, (yet) drivest me to death ere I come to it, make
(20) the West pleasant for me! Is that (so) bad? Life
is a circumscribed period: (even) the trees must fall.
Trample down wrongs—(yet) my wretchedness en
dures. Let Thoth, who propitiates the gods, judge me.
Let Khonsu, who writes in truth, defend me. (25) Let
Re, who pilots the sun barque, hear my speech. Let
Isdes . . . defend me. My wretchedness is heavy . . .
Pleasant would be the defense (30) of a god for the
secrets of my body."2
What my soul said to me: "Art thou not a man? Art
thou... whilst thou livest? What is thy goal? Thou art
concerned with [living] like a possessor of wealth 1""
1 This sounds as though the soul had refused to continue the argument. * The man wishes to seek death by fire, but his soul refuses to support him in this escape. He then longs for the advocacy of the gods and concaves of himself as pleading his case before a divine tribunal. »The soul makes the sharp retort that the man seems to be concerned
I said: "I have not departed as long as these things
are neglected. He who carries (men) off forcibly will
take, without (35) caring about thee, (like) any criminal saying: 'I shall carry thee off, for thy (fate) is still death, (though) thy name may live.'4 (But) yonder is a place for settling down, the guide of the heart; the West is home . . . If my soul, which is innocent, will listen to me (40), and its heart agrees with me, it will be fortunate. (Then) I shall make it reach the West like one who is in his pyramid, at whose burial a survivor has stood.5 I shall make a shelter [over] thy corpse, (so that) thou mayest scorn another soul (45) as inert. I shall make a shelter—now it must not be (too) cool—(so that) thou mayest scorn another soul which is (too) hot. I shall drink at the watering place and s h a l l . . . f (so that) thou mayest scorn another soul which is hungry.8 If thou delayest (50) me from a death of this fashion, thou wilt not find a place where thou canst settle down in the West. (So) be [patient], my soul and my brother, until my heir has appeared, he who will make offerings and will stand at the grave on the day of burial, so that he may prepare the bed (55) of the cemetery."7 My soul opened its mouth to me, that it might answer what I had said: "If thou art thinking of burial, that is heart's distress. It is a bringing of tears, making a man sad. It is taking a man out of his house, (so that) he is left on the hillside, (whence) thou shalt never go up above that thou mightest see (60) the suns. They who build in granite and who hew out chambers in a pyramid, good men in good work, as soon as the builders have become gods,8 their offering-stones are as bare, for lack of a survivor, as (those of) the weary ones, the dead on the dyke—(65) the waters take hold of an end of him, and the sunlight as well, and the fish of the water-banks talk to them." Listen to me. Behold, it is good for men to listen. Pursue the happy day and forget care!
"The poor man plows his plot of ground and loads his harvest (70) into a ship's hold. He makes the journey by towing (the boat), (because) his feast day is ap
with the proprieties of funerary observance, as though he were a man of means and position. 4 Death takes any man, whether he has prepared for it or not. 5 If the soul will only agree, then the death will effectively be like a normal death. 8 The argument seems to be that even a poor man can contrive a burial of adequate dignity, so that the soul need not fear its standing among other souls. 7 The man is not entirely without relatives or friends who will do what is necessary for his funerary care. 8 That is, are dead. • Ultimately the kings and nobles who were able to build themselves pyramids were no better off than the poor men abandoned as dead on the dykes and half immersed in the water. For a similar thought of the same period, see the Song of the Harper (p. 467 below). In the same way, the Song of the Harper urges that, because of the uncertainties of death, one should give himself up to pleasure.

proaching.10 When he sees the forthcoming of an
evening of high water, he is vigilant in the ship when
Re retires, (and so) comes out (safely), with his wife
and his children being lost on the lake, treacherous
( 7 5 ) with crocodiles in the night.11 At last he sits down,
when he can take part in speech, saying: 'I am not
weeping for that mother, (though) there is no coming
forth from the West for her, for another (time) on earth.12 (But) I am concerned about her (unborn) children, broken in the egg, who saw the face of the crocodile-god (80) before they had (even) lived!'13 "The poor man asks for an afternoon meal, (but) his wife says to him: 'It's for supper!' He goes out-ofdoors to grumble for a while. If he comes back into the house and is like another man, his wife is (still) experienced in him: that he does not listen to her (but) grumbles, (85) unresponsive to communications."14 I opened my mouth to my soul, that I might answer what it had said:15
Behold, my name will reek through thee1" More than the stench of bird-droppings * On summer days, when the sky is hot. Behold, my name will reek through thee (More than) a fish-handler On the day of the catch, when the sky is hot. (90) Behold, my name will reek through thee More than the stench of bird-droppings, More than a covert of reeds with waterfowl. Behold, my name will reek through thee
More than the stench of fishermen,
More than the stagnant pools which they have
fished. Behold, my name will reek through thee
More than the stench of crocodiles,
More than sitting in the assembly among the
crocodiles. Behold, my name will reek through thee
More than a (married) woman
Against whom a he has been told because of a man.
Behold, my name will reek through thee (100)
More than a sturdy boy of whom it is said:
10 Because he is in a hurry to reach home for his feast, he tows his boat for greater speed. II Before he reaches home a storm comes up, and his wife and children are lost, a prey to crocodiles. 12 His wife, by dying in this way, cannot "come forth by day" to enjoy continued contacts with this life, as do those who die normally and are given normal funerary service. 13 This parable of the poor man who loses his children by accident is probably meant to persuade the man that the only proper death is the normal death. 14 This parable is not clear. It seems to say that a poor man cannot expect to eat in the late afternoon and also in the evening. The soul's implication would then be that a poor man cannot ask for the luxury of death with an elaborate funeral. 15 The man's argument, by which he finally wins over his soul, is presented in four poems consisting of tristichs of uniform theme and structure: (a) the man's name will be in evil odor, if he follows the advice of his soul; (b) the people of his day are wholly hostile and unscrupulous; (c) death is a release from such miseries; (d) the dead have access to the gods. 18 "Behold, my name is overflooded (with bad odor) from thee"followed by a series of comparisons, most of which have to do with fetid smells.
"He belongs to his nW!"17

rebellion,
Of which (only) the outside can be seen.18

Thus we shall make a home together."27
21 "Death is in my face today"—in such times, I look upon death as—. 22 There would be no more obloquy to this than to its modern counterpart: going on a picnic to the beach. 28 Obscure. Perhaps unexpectedly good weather permits a man to go fowling. 24 "Verily, he who is there will be"—he who is over there in the realm of the dead. 25 They who live on in the realm of the dead will share in the privileges of the gods. 26 Death by fire is likened to a burnt offering. 27 The soul is successfully won over to the idea of suicide and will share the man's fate, whatever it may be.·
It has come (to its end), (155) its beginning to its
end, as found in writing.
THE PROTESTS OF THE ELOQUENT PEASANT
The duty of social justice was an insistent theme of the Middle Kingdom. At that time the man of power and position was asked to deal impartially with all men—or even to be partial in seeking out and meeting need. In the following text, this theme is given a story setting and is emphasized by the mechanism of letting a poor man insist upon his rights. The story is laid in the reign of Neb-kau-Re Khety III, king at Herakleopolis and one of the competing pharaohs of the early 21 st century B.C. Almost all of the manuscript material derives from the Middle Kingdom (20th-i8th centuries). These are three papyri in Berlin (10499-"]*."; 3023-"Bi"; and 3025-"B2") and a papyrus in the British Museum (10274), with other, smaller fragments. The facsimile publication was Hieratische Papyrus aus den königlichen Museen zu Berlin, iv, 1. Die Klagen des Bauern, bearbeitet von F. Vogelsang und A. H. Gardiner (Leipzig, 1908). The texts were then studied by Vogelsang, Kommentar zu den Klagen des Bauern (Untersuch., vi, Leipzig, 1913). See also E. Suys, £tude sur le conte du fellah plaideur (Rome, 1933). There are translations by A. H. Gardiner, in JE A, ix (1923), 5-25, and by Erman, LAE, 116-31.*
(Ri) THERE WAS A MAN whose name was Khun
Anup, and he was a peasant of the Field of Salt.1 Now
he had a wife, whose name was [Me]rit. THEN THIS
PEASANT SAID TO THIS HIS WIFE: "Behold, I am going
down to Egypt to [fetch] food thence for my children.
Now go and measure for me the grain which is in the
barn, the grain remaining from [last year]." Thereupon
he measured for her [six] hekat of grain.2 (5) THEN
THIS PEASANT SAID TO THIS HIS WIFE: "Behold, [there are]
twenty heJ{at of grain for thee and thy children for
food. But thou shouldst make for me these six he\at
of grain into bread and beer for every day in which
[/ may be traveling]."
So this peasant went down into Egypt, after he had
loaded his donkeys with iW-plants, rwwiZ-plants, (10)
natron, salt, . . . staves of the Farafra Oasis, leopard
skins, (15) wolf hides,... pebbles,... doves,.. .* earth's
hair, and anis, (35) full (measure) of all the good
produce of the Field of Salt. So this peasant went south
toward Herakleopolis, and he reached the region of
Per-Fefi, to the north of Medenit.4 He met there a man
standing on the riverbank, whose name was Thut-nakht.
He was the son of a man (40) whose name was Isri,
and he was a vassal of the Chief Steward, Meru's son
Rensi.
THEN THIS THUT-NAKHT SAID, when he saw this peas
ant's donkeys, which were tempting to his heart:
"Would that I had some effective idol, (so that) I
might steal away the goods of this peasant with it!"
Now the house of this Thut-nakht was on a riverbank
(45) pathway. It was narrow; it was not at all wide: it
1 The modern Wadi Natrun, northwest of Herakleopolis." 2 A hekfit was a little over four dry quarts. 3 The uncertain elements in a long list are here omitted. 4 The locations of Per-Fefi and of Medenit are unknown.

may have exceeded the width of a loincloth. One side
of it was under the water, and the other side of it was
under grain. T H E N THIS THUT-NAKHT SAID TO HIS ATTEND
ANT: "Go and fetch me a sheet from my house." It
was brought to him immediately. Then he spread it
on the riverbank pathway. Thereupon (50) its fringe
came to rest on the water and its hem on the grain.
Then this peasant came along the public road.5
( B I , I ) T H E N THIS THUT-NAKHT SAID: "Be accommo
dating, peasant! Wouldst thou tread upon my gar
ments?" T H E N THIS PEASANT SAID: "I shall do thy pleas
ure. My course is good." So he went up higher. T H E N
THIS THUT-NAKHT SAID: (5) "Wilt thou have my grain
for a path?" Then this peasant said: "My course is
good. The embankment is high, and the (only other)
way is under grain, (but still) thou providest our road
with thy garments. Now wilt thou not let us pass by on
the road?" Now he had (scarcely) finished saying [this] word,
when one of the donkeys filled (10) his mouth with a
wisp of grain. Then this Thut-nakht said: "Behold,
I will take away thy donkey, peasant, because he is
eating my grain. Behold, he will (have to) thresh be
cause of his boldness." Then this peasant said: "My
course is good. (Only) one (wisp) has been damaged.
I brought my donkey because o f . . . ; wilt thou take him
(15) for filling his mouth with a wisp of grain? More
over, I know the lord of this district. It belongs to
the Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi. Moreover, he is
the one who punishes every robber in this entire land.
Shall I be robbed in his district?" Then this Thut
nakht said: "Is this the proverb which men say: (20)
'The name of the poor man is pronounced (only) for
his master's sake'?6 I am the one who is speaking
to thee, (but) it is the Chief Steward whom thou
mentionest!"
Then he took a stick of green tamarisk against him.
Then he belabored all his limbs with it, and his donkeys
were taken away and driven into his estate. Thereupon
this peasant (25) wept very greatly because of the
pain of what had been done to him. Then this Thut
nakht said: "Do not be (so) noisy, peasant! Behold,
thou art at the home of the Lord of Silence."7 Then
this peasant said: "Thou beatest me, thou stealest my
goods, and now thou (even) takest away the complaint
from my mouth! O Lord of Silence, mayest thou give
me back (30) my property! Then I shall not cry out
(so that) thou art alarmed!"8
Then this peasant spent the time up to ten days
appealing to this Thut-nakht, (but) he would not pay
attention to it. So this peasant went to Herakleopolis
to appeal to the Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi. He
met him going out of the door (35) of his house to
embark on his official barge.
5 "On the way of all people." 6 Thut-nakht quotes, somewhat inaptly, a proverb against the peasant's attempt to invoke higher authority. 7 Osiris, god of the dead, had a sanctuary near Herakleopolis. 8 By appealing to the god for justice, the peasant turns to his own account Thut-nakht's attempt to silence him.
Then this peasant said: "Would that I might be
permitted to make a communication to thee about this
recital of fact! It is (only) a matter of letting an attend
ant of thine of thy choice come to me, (so that) I
might send him back to thee about it."9 So the Chief
Steward, Meru's son Rensi, had (40) an attendant of his
choice go in front of him,10 and this peasant sent him
back about this affair in every aspect of it.
Then the Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi, laid a
charge against this Thut-nakht before the officials who
were at his side. Then they said to him: "Probably it is
a peasant of his who has gone to someone else beside
him. (45) Behold, that is what they do to peasants of
theirs who go to others beside them.11 It is (only) a
matter of having this Thut-nakht punished for a litde
natron and a little salt. Let him be ordered to replace it,
and he will replace it." Then (50) the Chief Steward,
Meru's son Rensi, was silent; he did not reply to these
officials, nor did he reply to this peasant. Then this peasant came to appeal to the Chief Steward,
Meru's son Rensi. He said:
"O Chief Steward, my lord, greatest of the great,
undertaker of that which is not and of that which
is!12 If thou embarkest on the lake of (55) justice,
mayest thou sail on it with a fair breeze! A squall shall
not tear away thy sail, thy boat shall not lag, no mis
fortune shall overtake thy mast, thy yards shall not
break, . . . the current shall not carry thee away, thou
shalt not taste the evils (60) of the river, thou shalt
not see a frightened face! (Even) the timid fish shall
come to thee, and thou shalt attain (some) of the fattest
fowl. Because thou art the father of the orphan, the
husband of the widow, the brother of the divorcee, and
the apron of him that is motherless. Let me make thy

a leader free from covetousness, a great man free from
wrongdoing, one who destroys falsehood and brings
justice into being, and who comes at the cry of him
who gives voice. When I speak, mayest thou hear. Do
justice, thou favored one whom the favored ones favor!
Dispose of (70) my burdens. Behold me, (how) bur
dened I am! Count me: behold, I am lacking!"13
Now this peasant made this speech in the time of the
majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Neb
kau-Re, the triumphant. So the Chief Steward, Meru's
son Rensi, went before his majesty and said: "My lord,
(75) I have found one of these peasants who is really
eloquent. His goods have been stolen, and, behold, he
has come to appeal to me about it."
T H E N HIS MAJESTY SAID: " A s TRULY AS THOU WISHEST
TO SEE ME IN HEALTH, thou shalt make him linger here,

Later he becomes more indignant in his appeals, daring to charge the Chief Steward with injustice.

without replying to anything which he may say. For the purpose of keeping him (80) talking, be thou silent. Then have his speech brought to us in writing, (that) we may hear it. But provide that on which his wife and children may live. Behold, one of these peasants may come before his house is empty down to the ground.14 Further, keep this peasant himself alive. Thou shalt cause that provisions be given to him, without letting him know that thou art the one who has given them to him." So they gave him ten loaves of bread and two jars of beer (85) every day. The Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi, used to give them. He used to give them to a friend of his, and he was the one who gave them to him. Then the Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi, sent to the Mayor of the Field of Salt about providing food for this peasant's wife: thirty hekat of grain every day.
T H E N THIS PEASANT CAME TO APPEAL TO H I M A SECOND
TIME. . . . ( 1 0 0 ) . .
T H E N THE CHIEF STEWARD, MERU'S SON RENSI, SAID:
"Is what belongs to thee more important to thy heart than (the fact) that my attendant may carry thee off ?"16 Then this peasant said: "The measurer of (105) piles (of grain) cheats for himself. He who should fill up for another trims his share. He who should lead according to the laws orders robbery. Who then will punish meanness? He who should drive out decay (himself) makes distortions. One man is straightforward in crookedness, another assents to mischance. Dost thou thyself find (a lesson) for thee? Punishment is short, (but) mischance is long. A (good) example comes back to its place of yesterday.17 Now this is the command: 'Do to the doer ( n o ) to cause that he do.' That is thanking him18 for what he may do. That is parrying something before (it is) shot. That is ordering something from him who (already) has business."19... (145) . . .
"Desire to live long, as it is said: 'Doing justice is the (very) breath of the nose.'20 Carry out punishment against him who should be punished, and none shall equal thy scrupulousness. Does the hand-scales err? Does the stand-balance incline to the side? Is even Thoth (150) indulgent?21 Then thou (also) mayest work mischief. When thou makest thyself the second22 of these three, if the three are indulgent, then thou (also) mayest be indulgent. . . . Take not, (for) thou shouldst act against a taker.

14 One of the peasants of the Wadi Natrun is to come to Egypt to get food- for the peasant's family. 15 In his second appeal the peasant boldly suggests that the expected dispenser of justice is becoming an abuser of justice. 18 The Chief Steward interrupts with a threat of punishment if the peasant insists upon his property claims. 17 A good deed is normative of the good times of the past. 18 "That is praising god for him." 19 Doing unto others, in order to induce them to do for oneself, produces in advance the desired results. 20 The Egyptians inhaled the "breath of life." 21 Thoth was the patron of just measure. 22 Sic, in the sense of "companion."

then will punish meanness?
"Behold, thou art a wretch of a washerman, covetous in injuring (170) a friend, abandoning his partner for the sake of his client. He who comes that he may buy is his brother.23 Behold, thou art a ferryman who ferries over (only) him that has a fare, a straight-dealer whose straight-dealing is clipped short. . . . Behold, thou art a butler whose delight is butchering, (177) the mutilation of which (does) not (fall) upon him Prepare not for the morrow before it arrives; one knows not what mischance may be in it." Now when this peasant made this speech, (185) the Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi, was at the entrance of the administration building. Then he had two guardsmen attend to him with whips. Then they belabored all his limbs therewith. Then this peasant said: "So the son of Meru goes on erring! His face is blind to what he sees and deaf to what he hears, misguided of heart because of what has been related to him. Behold, thou art a town (190) which has no mayor, like a company which has no chief, like a ship in which there is no pilot, a confederacy which has no leader. Behold, thou art a constable who steals, a mayor who accepts (bribes), a district overseer who should punish robbery, (but) who has become the precedent for him that does (it)." .. ,24 "Do not plunder of his property a poor man, a weakling as thou knowest him. His property is the (very) breath of a suffering man, and he who takes it away is one who stops up his nose. Thou wert appointed to conduct hearings, to judge between two men, (235) and to punish the brigand, (but) behold, it is the upholder of the thief which thou wouldst be. One trusts in thee, whereas thou art become a transgressor. Thou wert appointed to be a dam for the sufferer, guarding lest he drown, (but) behold, thou art his flowing lake." Now then this peasant came (240) to appeal to him a sixth time, and he said: ". . . (250) . . . Cheating diminishes justice. (But) good full (measure)—justice neither falls short nor overflows...." Now then (290) this peasant came to appeal to him an eighth time, and he said: "O Chief Steward, my lord! One may fall a long way because of greed. The covetous man is void of success; (any) success of his belongs to failure. Though thy heart is covetous, it is not (of avail) for thee. Though thou robbest, it does not profit thee, who should still permit a man to attend to his (own) proper business. Thy (own) needs are in thy house; thy belly is full; the grain-measure overflows—(but) when it is jostled (295) its surplus is lost on the ground. Takers, robbers, appropriators, magistrates—(and yet) made to punish evil! Magistrates are a refuge for the violent—(and yet) made to punish deceit!...
23 In these passages the Chief Steward is likened to a business man without charity, his sole interest being profit. 24 The above is from the third appeal. The following extra« is from the fifth.

It is good if thou art good—good indeed. Now justice lasts unto eternity; it goes down into the necropolis with him who does it. When he is buried and interred, (310) his name is not wiped out upon earth, (but) he is remembered for goodness. That is a principle of the word of god.27 Is it the hand-scales—(then) it does not tilt. Is it the stand-balance—(then) it does not incline to the side. Whether I shall come or whether another may come, thou shouldst address (us) (315) with an answer. Do not address (us) silently. Do not attack him who cannot attack " (B2,9i) Now THEN this peasant CAME to appeal to him a ninth time, and he said: "O Chief Steward, my lord! The balance of men is their tongue. It is the scales which seeks out deficiencies (in weight). Carry out punishment against him who should be punished, (or some) one will equal thy scrupulousness. . . . If falsehood walks about, it goes astray. It cannot cross over in the ferry; [it] does not advance. (100) As for him who grows rich thereby, he has no children, he has no heirs upon earth. As for him who sails with it, he cannot reach land, his boat cannot moor at its town. "Be not heavy; thou art not light. Do not delay; thou art not swift. Be not partial. Do not listen to (105) the heart. Do not veil thy face against him whom thou knowest. Do not blind thy face against him whom thou hast beheld. Do not rebuff him who petitions thee. Mayest thou step down from this sluggishness, (in order that) thy saying may be reported: 'Act for him who acts for thee.' Do not listen to everybody, (but) summon a man to his (own) rightful interests. There is no yesterday for the slothful,28 ( n o ) no friend for him deaf to truth, no holiday for the covetous.

I shall go that I may appeal (115) about thee to Anubis." Then the Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi, sent two guardsmen to bring him back. Then this peasant was afraid, for he thought that (it) was done in order to punish him for this speech which he had made. Then this peasant said: "The approach of a thirsty man to water, the tasting (120) of milk by the nursing childthis [zV] death, for the coming of which one has longed to see, (when) his death comes for him delayed."30 Then the Chief Steward, Meru's son Rensi, said: "Do

If this threat carries on into the following sentences, it means that the peasant will petition the god of the dead to take action against the Chief Steward. 30 Despite his fear of the maximum punishment, the peasant puts the best face on the prospect of death.

Proverbs and Precepts
Egyptian Instructions
(Translator: John A. Wilson)
THE INSTRUCTION OF THE VIZIER PTAH-HOTEP
The Egyptians delighted in compilations of wise sayings, which were directive for a successful life. To them, this was "wisdom." One of the earliest of these compilations purports to come from Ptah-hotep, the vizier of King Izezi of the Fifth Dynasty (about 2450 B.C.). T h e old councilor is supposed to be instructing his son and designated successor on the actions and attitudes which make a successful official of the state. The chief manuscript is the Papyrus Prisse of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (No. 183-194), written in the Middle Kingdom. Later documents, running into the Eighteenth Dynasty, are British Museum Papyri 10371, 10435, and 10509, and the reverse of Carnarvon Tablet I, now in the Cairo Museum (cf. pp. 232-233 above). Facsimiles of the hieratic texts were published by G. Jequier, Le Papyrus Prisse et ses variantes (Paris, 1911). Extracts in facsimile are given in G. Möller, Hieratische Lesestüc^e (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1927), 1, 2-3. T h e texts are transcribed into hieroglyphic in E. Devaud, Les maximes de Ptahhotep (Fribourg, 1916). T h e following translation uses Devaud's numbering for the texts. There are translations by B. Gunn, The Instruction of Ptah-hotep and the Instruction of Ke'gemni (Wisdom of the East Series; London, 1909), and by Erman, LAE, 54-66. On the general subject of Egyptian wisdom literature in successive periods, sec R. Anthes, Lebensregeln und Lebensweisheit der alten Aegypter (AO, 32,2, Leipzig, 1933).* (See Addenda).
T H E INSTRUCTION1 OF THE MAYOR AND VIZIER PTAH
HOTEP,2 UNDER the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Izezi, living forever and ever. The Mayor and Vizier Ptah-hotep says: 0 sovereign, my lord! Oldness has come; old age has descended. Feebleness has arrived; dotage is coming anew. (10) The heart sleeps wearily every day. The eyes are weak, the ears are deaf, the strength is disappearing because of weariness of heart, and the mouth is silent and cannot speak. The heart is forgetful and cannot recall yesterday. The bone suffers old age. Good is become evil. All taste is gone. (20) What old age does to men is evil in every respect. The nose is stopped up and cannot breathe. (Simply) to stand up or to sit down is difficult.
Let a command be issued to this servant to make a staff of old age,3 that my son may be made to stand in my place. (30) Then may I speak to him the words of them that listen and the ideas of the ancestors, of them
1 The word sebayit "teaching," came to be used by the Egyptians for "wisdom," because of their orientation toward the models of the past. 2 There was more than one vizier named Ptah-hotep around the time of the pharaoh Izezi. The best known of them left a tomb at Sakkarah: M. Murray, Saqqara Mastabas, 1 (London, 1905). 8 The son as the support of his father. "This servant," literally "the servant there," is polite for "me."
that hearkened to the gods.4 Then shall the like be done for thee, that strife may be banished from the people and the Two Banks may serve thee. Then the majesty of this god5 said: Teach thou him first about speaking. Then he may set an example for the children of officials. (40) May obedience enter into him, and all heart's poise. Speak to him. There is no one born wise.
T H E BEGINNING OF THE EXPRESSION OF GOOD SPEECH,
SPOKEN BY the Hereditary Prince and Count, God's Father and God's Beloved, eldest son of the king, of his body, the Mayor and Vizier, Ptah-hotep, in instructing the ignorant about wisdom and about the rules for good speech, as of advantage to him who will hearken (50) and of disadvantage to him who may neglect them. TTien he said to his son: Let not thy heart be puffed-up because of thy knowledge; be not confident because thou art a wise man. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as the wise. The (full) limits of skill cannot be attained, and there is no skilled man equipped to his (full) advantage.6 Good speech is more hidden than the emerald, but it may be found with maidservants at the grindstones... / IF THOU ART A LEADER (85) commanding the affairs of the multitude, seek out for thyself every beneficial deed, until it may be that thy (own) affairs are without wrong. Justice is great, and its appropriateness is lasting; it has not been disturbed since the time of him who made it, (whereas) there is punishment for him who passes over its laws. It is the (right) path before him who knows nothing. Wrongdoing has never brought its undertaking into port. (It may be that) it is fraud that gains riches, (95) (but) the strength of justice is that it lasts, and a man may say: "It is the property of my father."8...
IF THOU ART ONE OF THOSE SITTING (120) at the table
of one greater than thyself, take what he may give, when it is set before thy nose. Thou shouldst gaze at what is before thee. Do not pierce him with many stares, (for such) an aggression against him is an abomination to the \a? Let thy face be cast down until he addresses thee, and thou shouldst speak (only) when he addresses thee. (130) Laugh after he laughs, and it will be very pleasing to his heart and what thou mayest do will be pleasing to the heart. No one can know what is in the heart. As for the great man when he is at meals, his purposes

A proper ka 1S a Ka with which one is satisfied."28 One does not know what may happen, so that he may understand the morrow. If misfortunes occur among those (now) favored, it is the clients who (still) say: "Welcome!" One does not secure satisfaction from a stranger; one has recourse to a client when there is trouble....
17 Variant: "One who has woes likes the assuaging of his heart better than the doing of that for which he came." 18 Variant: "as a son." 19 Perhaps: He who has a wandering eye for the women cannot be keen. 20 "A mean person is he who goes out (from?) under his kinsfolk; (he is) void of the bringing of speech." 21 The desire for children—particularly male children—was perennial in the orient. 22 The word "satisfy" sometimes means "pay off." The word "clients," literally "those who enter," may here apply to the entourage of a high official. 23 Probably: He is the very spirit of rapacity; the right kind of a spirit is one which gratifies others.

THE INSTRUCTION FOR KING MERI-KA-RE
The confused period between the Old and Middle Kingdoms was a time of changing values. T h e overturn of the old sanctions of power and property exerted a sobering influence. New values were increasingly expressed in spiritual and social terms, as the following text from that period shows. It presents the advice which one of the several competing rulers of that time (end of the 22nd century B.C.) gave to his son and successor. The text is on the verso of the Papyrus Leningrad 1116A, a manuscript copied in the Eighteenth Dynasty, in the latter half of the 15th century B.C.; published by W. Golenischeff, Les papyrus hi&ratiques no. ///5, 1116A, et 1116B de VErmitage Imperial ä St. Pitersbourg (St. Petersburg, 1913), Pis. IX-XIV. T w o other very fragmentary papyrus copies of the text are known. Translated by A. H. Gardiner in JE A, 1 (1914), 20-36, and by Erman, LAE, 75-84. An excellent special study is A. Schärft, Der historische Abschnitt der Lehre für König Merikare (SBAW, 1936, H e f t 8)?

If he feared hostility he would have enough fears right at home. 17 It is not clear what the king's failure and the resultant retribution were. Confession of error was very exceptional for any Egyptian, particularly for the pharaoh. cf. n.44 below. 18 A rival dynasty to that of Herakleopolis had been set up at Thebes at this time. Apparently on the basis of some "prophecy," there was a truce in force at the time of these instructions. Within a generation or two Thebes was to put an end to the Herakleopolitan rule. 19 This was the chief city of the Thinite (Abydos) nome and the frontier between the realms of Herakleopolis and Thebes. Taut(?) is unknown. 20 If the restoration is correct, this would be Mery-ib-Re Khety I, a ruler at Herakleopolis perhaps a century before the time of these instructions. 2 1 1 followed the principles laid down by my predecessors: do not exact tribute from a friendly neighbor. 22 From the quarries at Assuan. 28 The limestone quarries across the River from Memphis.

24 As every local ruler knew, the current peaceful relations with the south were not duplicated by those with the Delta. Het-shenu was near Heliopolis; the other two sites are unknown. 25 The western Delta was friendly to Herakleopolis and transmitted the timber of Asia. 28 Foreign warriors. 27 The "islands" cut off by waterways within the Delta were disaffected from Herakleopolis? 28 Internal local jealousy? 29 The land which has been delivered from the foreigners has been made into small administrative units—perhaps on the principle of divide et impera.
80 Even the priest must work out his taxes. 81 From somewhere near modern Minieh in Middle Egypt to the Suez frontier (on the "Ways-of-Horus" cf. pp. 2 1 , 478). Thus the east Delta was anchored along a newly established frontier line. 82 The characterization is that of the nomad Bedouin, who raid but fight no campaigns. 88 Uncertain, but perhaps a contrast between the pharaoh and the (inscrutable?) foreigners.

58 Unblemished, he will join his father in the world of the dead. 54 Leave to god the punishment of those close to you. 55 Apparently the wildest exaggeration of majesty: serving the pharaoh is like being one of the gods. Or: the king's followers will become gods after death? 58 The servants' quarters were in the rear of a house; cf. n.5 above. Scharff, op.at., 8, takes this passage as indicating that Khety is the king

He it was who made a book which was the Instruction of the King of Upper [and Lower Egypt: Se]hetep-ib-[Re]—life, prosperity, health!—when he had gone to rest, when he joined heaven and entered among the lords of the necropolis." This passage must be treated as a valid or as a misapplied tradition that a scribe Khety composed the present text. 2 That is, the deceased. The applicability of this epithet and the question whether it might have been added in a later copy are critical to the problem whether the king spoke in life or posthumously. 3 For the argument that "message of truth" means a "dream" or a "revelation" from the dead king to the living king, see B. Gunn in JEA, xxvii (1941), 2-5.· 4 Sen-Usert I, who was coregent in the last ten years of the reign of his father, Amen-em-het I. 5 Corrupt, or perhaps figurative for a covert obscenity of disrespect. e Future pharaohs. cf.

Apparently his own bodyguard was involved.

9 This seems to say that the attack on Amen-em-het was successful. In conflict with that impression, the following context would suggest that his long coregency with his son had not yet begun. In the latter case, the attack could not have been fatal. 10 The old king feels constrained to offer his son advice because his own misplaced confidence in his servants had been so cosdy. II Following Gardiner, opjcit., 489 ff., the first two questions may carry chagrin at the actual situation, a conspiracy within the king's own harem, while the third question would be a metaphorical bridge to the king's benevolences which are to be listed. He was the beneficent channel of irrigation for the soil of Egypt, and the treason was an injurious breach in that channel. 12 The southern and northern limits of Egypt. 13 Perhaps "the regions be-armed," as a designation of Egypt within its frontier protection. 14 Peoples to the south of Egypt. 15 As submissive as a cur in one's own home. 18 Corrupt in the extant texts, but perhaps: I know the time limits of my palace, since I am the Lord-to-the-Limit. 17 This is an example of our difficulties in translating a corrupt text without aid. The passages from " M u c h " to "countenance" are rendered as they are visible in the best of four broken and corrupt texts. It is assumed that the initial sentence means: "Much (insincere) 'Oh surely, surely!' is in the streets." If the sentences have any meaning at all, they deal with the sincere loyalty of men to Sen-Usert I, the successor. However, our passage is a quotation from the Admonitions of Ipu-wer (p. 442 below), to the effect that there is distress in the land, of which the wise man is aware, but of which the fool is ignorant: " W h y , surely, the children of nobles are cast out in the streets. The wise man says: 'Yes, (it is so).' T h e ignorant man says: 'No, (it is not)'; and it is fair in the sight of him who knows it not." How this quotation fits in the present context is obscure.

THE INSTRUCTION OF PRINCE HOR-DEDEF
The only excuse for introducing the miserable remains of the following text is that the composer to whom it is ascribed was so frequently mentioned as one of the traditional wise men of Egypt.1 Ii-em-hotep, a high official of the pharaoh Djoser, and Hor-dedef, a son of the pharaoh Khufu (or Cheops, about 27th century B.C.), became legendary for their wisdom. It is unfortunate that the sole surviving elements of their ascribed lore should be in such miserable physical condition, uncertain of translation, and rather trite in content. Munich Ostracon 3400, published by E. Brunner-Traut in ZAcS, LXXVI (1940), 3-9, PL 1, and Oriental Institute Ostracon 17003 (unpublished). Both come from Thebes and are to be dated, on the basis of handwriting to the late Nineteenth or early Twentieth Dynasty (1250-1150 B.C.). However, the language indicates a date of composition somewhat earlier*
Beginning of the instruction which the Hereditary Prince and Count, the King's Son Hor-dedef, made for his son, whom he bred, named Au-ib-Re.
* [Be not] boastful before (my very) eyes, and beware of the boasting of another. If thou art a man of standing and foundest [a household, take] thou a wife as a man of feeling,2 and a male child will be born to thee. Thou shouldst build thy house for thy son (in) the place where thou art. Embellish thy [house] of the necropolis, and enrich thy place of the West.8 A lowly reception is for him who is dead, (but) a high reception for him who is living, and thy house of death is (destined) for life*
18 Quite obscure, unless the intention is to deny that children will be abandoned in the streets under Sen-Usert I. See the preceding note. 19 Texts: "thy heart." The tentative translation assumes that Amen-em-het states here that, through death, he is turning over rule to his son. 20 The last paragraph is so corrupt that translation is very shaky and any commentary would be futile.
1 cf. pp. 432, n.4; 467, n.4; 476, n.16, and the Westcar Papyrus: Erman, LAE, 36 ff. In the "Satirical Letter" (p. 476 below), there is an allusion to a written treatise of Hor-dedef. This translation continues the customary rendering of his name as Hor-dedef, despite equally good reasons to adopt the form Djedef-Hor. 2Apparendy, "as the master of a heart." 8 For the passage beginning "If thou art a man of standing," cf. the Instruction of Ptah-hotep (p. 413 above), and for the passage beginning "Embellish thy," cf. the Instruction for Meri-ka-Re (p. 417 above). 4 Apparent corruptions and differences between the two texts make any translation uncertain. The meaning may be that a deceased Egyptian is living and not dead if the needful rites have been observed.

THE INSTRUCTION OF ANI
T h e following extracts are from a set of instructions given by a father to his son toward the end of the Egyptian Empire. They exist only in later copies, so that there has been abundant opportunity for corruption to enter the copies. However, they do reflect the later emphases of quietude, personal piety, and ritual activity. The final sections, not translated here, give the respectful answer of Ani's son, fearing that he cannot measure up to his father's high standards. The main manuscript is a papyrus of the Twenty-first or Twenty-second Dynasty (nth-8th centuries B.C.), now in the Cairo Museum, "Boulaq no. 4." It was published by F. Chabas, Les maximcs du scribe Ani (Chalon-sur-Saone, 1876-78). There is also a fragmentary papyrus of a somewhat earlier period, No. 16959 ^ Musee Guimet in Paris; a writing tablet of the Twenty-second Dynasty, N o . 8934 in Berlin; and two extracts elsewhere. There is a transcription into hieroglyphic in E. Suys, La sagessc d'Ani (Rome, 1935), and there are several extracts in A. Volten, Studien zum Weisheitsbuch dcs Anii (Copenhagen, 1937). The Berlin tablet begins: "The beginning of the instruction and teaching which the Scribe Ani of the Temple of (Queen) Nefert-iri made," i.e., Ah-mose Nefert-iri of the 18th dynasty: Revue d'Egyptologie, vi ( 1 9 5 1 ) , 42.

THE INSTRUCTION OF AMEN-EM-OPET
A general parallelism of thought or structure between Egyptian and Hebrew literature is common. It is, however, more difficult to establish a case of direct literary relation. For this reason, special attention is directed to the Instruction of Amen-em-Opet, son of Ka-nakht, and its very close relation to the Book of Proverbs, particularly Prov. 22:17-24:22. Amen-em-Opet differs from earlier Egyptian books of wisdom in its humbler, more resigned, and less materialistic outlook.1 The hieratic text is found in British Museum Papyrus 10474 and (a portion only) on a writing tablet in Turin. T h e papyrus is said to have come from Thebes. T h e date of the papyrus manuscript is debated. It is certainly subsequent to the Egyptian Empire. A date anywhere between the 10th and 6th centuries B.C. is possible, with some weight of evidence for the 7th-6th centuries. Only a selection of items from an extensive bibliography will be noted. T h e papyrus was reproduced in Facsimiles of Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Second Series, ed. by E. A. W. Budge (London, 1923), Pis. i-xiv; followed by Budge, The Teaching of Amen-em-apt, Son of Kana\ht (London, 1924). A. Erman established the specific relation of Amen-emOpet and Proverbs in Eine ägyptische Quelle der "Sprüche Salomos" ( S P AW, May, 1924, 86-93). H. Gressmann advanced the study of the relationship in ZAW, XLII (1924), 273-96. T h e standard study of the texts is now H. O. Lange, Das Weisheitsbuch des Amenemope (Copenhagen, 1925).

Although most commentators have inclined toward the view of a direct or indirect dependence of the Hebrew upon the Egyptian, a counteropinion was expressed by R. O.

SECOND CHAPTER:
Guard thyself against robbing the oppressed And against overbearing the disabled. (5) Stretch not forth thy hand against the approach of an old man, Nor steal away the speech of the aged. Let not thyself be sent on a dangerous errand, Nor love him who carries it out. Do not cry out against him whom thou hast attacked, (10) Nor return him answer on thy own behalf. He who does evil, the (very) river-bank abandons him, And his floodwaters carry him off. The north wind comes down that it may end his hour; It is joined to the tempest; (15) The thunder is loud, and the crocodiles are wicked. Thou heated man,7 how art thou (now) ? He is crying out, and his voice (reaches) to heaven. O moon,8 establish his crime (against him)!

FOURTH CHAPTER:11
As for the heated man of a temple, (vi 1) He is like a tree growing in the open. In the completion of a moment (comes) its loss of foliage, And its end is reached in the shipyards; (Or) it is floated far from its place, (5) And the flame is its burial shroud. (But) the truly silent man holds himself apart. He is like a tree growing in a garden. It flourishes and doubles its yield;
6 It is obvious that each chapter (Egyptian: "house") is divided into stanzas. For example, the first chapter divides 4-4-4. However, the division is not always clear. Does the second chapter divide 4-4-2-4-4-4-2 or 4-4-86-2? Does the fourth chapter divide 4-2-4-2 or 6-6? Therefore, this translation does not attempt such divisions. 7 The "hot" man is the passionate or impulsive man, in contrast to the "silent" or humbly pious man. 8 The moon-god Thoth was the barrister of the gods. 9 The thought of this section is akin to the "coals of fire" passage in Prov. 25:21-22 or 24:29. 10 The third chapter, here omitted, advises restraint in debate. "Sleep before speaking." Avoid arguing with "the heated man," because "the god knows how to answer him." 11 This chapter has general similarity to Ps. 1 or Jer. 17:5-8.
It (stands) before its lord. (10) Its fruit is sweet; its shade is pleasant; And its end is reached in the garden 12
SIXTH CHAPTER:
Do not carry off the landmark at the boundaries of the arable land, Nor disturb the position of the measuring-cord; Be not greedy after a cubit of land, Nor encroach upon the boundaries of a widow.18... (vii 15) Guard against encroaching upon the boundaries of the fields, Lest a terror carry thee off. (viii 10) One satisfies god with the will of the Lord, Who determines the boundaries of the arable land.14... Plow in the fields, that thou mayest find thy needs, (17) That thou mayest receive bread of thy own threshing floor. Better is a measure that the god gives thee Than five thousand (taken) illegally. They do not spend a day (in) the granary or barn; (ix 1) They make no provisions for the beer-jar. The completion of a moment is their lifetime in the storehouse; At daybreak they are sunk (from sight). Better is poverty in the hand of the god (5) Than riches in a storehouse; Better is bread, when the heart is happy, Than riches with sorrow.15
SEVENTH CHAPTER:
Cast not thy heart in pursuit of riches, (10) (For) there is no ignoring Fate and Fortune.16 Place not thy heart upon externals, (For) every man belongs to his (appointed) hour. Do not strain to seek an excess, When thy needs are safe for thee. (15) If riches are brought to thee by robbery, They will not spend the night with thee; At daybreak they are not in thy house: Their places may be seen, but they are not. The ground has opened its mouth . . . that it might swallow them up, And might sink them into the underworld. (x 1) (Or) they have made themselves a great breach of their (own) size And are sunken down into the underworld* (Or) they have made themselves wings like geese And are flown away to the heavens.17 (5)
12 The fifth chapter urges honesty in relations with the temple, because today's dispositions may be upset by tomorrow's changes. 1 8 c f . Prov. 22:28; 23:10. The omitted following portion gives god's penalties against the encroacher. 14 The thought is generally that of Prov. 2 3 : 1 1 . 15 cf. Prov. 15:16-17. 16 The god Shay and the goddess Renenut were two deified concepts, whose governing role was particularly strong at this time. 17 cf. Prov. 23:4-5.



4 i6PROVERBS AND P R E C E P T S
Rejoice not thyself (over) riches (gained) by robbery, Nor mourn because of poverty. If an archer in the van advances (too far), Then his squad abandons him. The ship of the covetous is left (in) the mud, (10) While the boat of the silent man (has) a fair breeze. Thou shouldst make prayer to the Aton when he rises, Saying: "Give me prosperity and health." He will give thee thy needs for this life, And thou wilt be safe from terror.18...
NINTH CHAPTER:
Do not associate to thyself the heated man, Nor visit him for conversation.19 Preserve thy tongue from answering thy superior, (xi 15) And guard thyself against reviling him. Do not make him cast his speech to lasso thee, Nor make (too) free with thy answer. Thou shouldst discuss an answer (only) with a man of thy (own) size, And guard thyself against plunging headlong into it. Swifter is speech when the heart is hurt (xii 1) Than wind of the head-waters.TM ... Do not leap to hold to such a one, Lest a terror carry thee off.
T E N T H C H A P T E R : (xiii 10)
Do not greet thy heated (opponent) in thy violence,21 Nor hurt thy own heart (thereby). Do not say to him: "Hail to thee!" falsely, When a terror is in thy belly. Do not talk with a man falsely— (15) The abomination of the god. Do not cut off thy heart from thy tongue, That all thy affairs may be successful. Be sincere22 in the presence of the common people, For one is safe in the hand of the god. (xiv 1) God hates him who falsifies words; His great abomination is the contentious of belly.
ELEVENTH CHAPTER:
Be not greedy for the property of a poor man, (5) Nor hunger for his bread. As for the property of a poor man, it (is) a blocking to the throat, It makes a vomiting to the gullet. If he has obtained it by false oaths, His heart is perverted by his belly.28... (xiv 10) The mouthful of bread (too) great thou swallowest and vomitest up, (xiv 17) And art emptied of thy good.24...
18 The omitted eighth chapter tells the effects of evil speech. 1 9 c f . Prov. 22:24. For the last two lines of this chapter, cf. ibid. 2 2 : 2 5 . 20 A long omitted passage sets forth the miseries of "the heated man." 21 Perhaps: You will suffer if you treat an excited opponent with arbitrary abruptness. Prov. 2 7 : 1 4 has been cited as a parallel, with the alteration of Hebrew re'e(Au) "his friend," to rt( "an evil ( m a n ) . " 22 "Heavy." 23 cf. Prov. 23:6-7. 24 cf. ibid., 23:8. T h e omitted twelfth chapter advises honesty in the trusted factor of a noble.
THIRTEENTH CHAPTER:
Do not confuse a man with a pen upon papyrus— (xv 20) The abomination of the god. Do not bear witness with false words, (xvi i) Nor support another person (thus) with thy tongue. Do not take an accounting of him who has nothing, Nor falsify thy pen. If thou findest a large debt against a poor man, (5) Make it into three parts, Forgive two, and let one stand. Thou wilt find it like the ways of life; Thou wilt lie down and sleep (soundly); in the morning Thou wilt find it (again) like good news. (10) Better is praise as one who loves men Than riches in a storehouse; Better is bread, when the heart is happy, Than riches with sorrow.25
SIXTEENTH CHAPTER:
Do not lean on the scales nor falsify the weights, Nor damage the fractions of the measure.26 Do not wish for a (common) country measure, (xvii 20) And neglect those of the treasury. The ape27 sits beside the balance, And his heart is the plummet. (xviii 1) Which god is as great as Thoth, He that discovered these things, to make them? Make not for thyself weights which are deficient; They abound in grief through the will of god.28 . . .
EIGHTEENTH CHAPTER: ( x i x 10)
Do not spend the night fearful of the morrow. At daybreak what is the morrow like? Man knows not what the morrow is like.29 God is (always) in his success, Whereas man is in his failure; (15) One thing are the words which men say, Another is that which the god does.80 Say not: "I have no wrongdoing," Nor (yet) strain to seek quarreling. As for wrongdoing, it belongs to the god; (20) It is sealed with his finger. There is no success in the hand of the god, But there is no failure before him. If he81 pushes himself to seek success, (xx 1) In the completion of a moment he damages it. Be steadfast in thy heart, make firm thy breast. Steer not with thy tongue (alone).
25 cf. ibid., 16:8. T h e fourteenth chapter asks honest relations with a client, the fifteenth honest recording by the secretary. 26 cf. ibid., 20:23. 27 The animal sacred to Thoth, god of just measure. 28 cf. Prov. 1 6 : 1 1 . The seventeenth chapter continues the theme of false measures. 29 Meaning and the probable strophic structure call for a line following this, to the effect that tomorrow is in the hand of god. 80 cf. Prov. 1 9 : 2 1 and 1 6 : 9 and the Homo proposuit sed Deus disponit of Thomas & Kempis. 81 A man.

If the tongue of a man (be) the rudder of a boat, (5) The All-Lord is its pilot.82...
TWENTIETH CHAPTER:
Do not confuse a man in the law court, Nor divert the righteous man. Give not thy attention (only) to him clothed in white, (xxi 1) Nor give consideration to him that is unkempt.88 Do not accept the bribe of a powerful man, Nor oppress for him the disabled. Justice is the great reward of god; (5) He gives it to whom he w i l l . . . . Do not falsify the income on the records* Nor damage the plans of god. Do not discover for thy own self the will of god, (15) Without (reference to) Fate and Fortune.84...
TWENTY-FIRST CHAPTER:
Do not say: "I have found a strong superior, (xxii 1) For a man in thy city has injured me." Do not say: "I have found a patron, For one who hates me has injured me." For surely thou knowest not the plans of god, (5) Lest thou be ashamed on the morrow. Sit thou down at the hands of the god, And thy silence will cast them down.85... Empty not thy belly to everybody, Nor damage (thus) the regard for thee. Spread not thy words to the common people, Nor associate to thyself one (too) outgoing of heart.86 Better is a man whose talk (remains) in his belly (15) Than he who speaks it out injuriously.87 One does not run to reach success, One does not throw to his (own) damage.88...
TWENTY-THIRD CHAPTER:
Do not eat bread before a noble, Nor lay on thy mouth at first. If thou art satisfied with false chewings, (xxiii 15) They are a pastime for thy spittle. Look at the cup which is before thee, And let it serve thy needs.89 As a noble is great in his office, He is as a well abounds (in) the drawing (of water).40...
TWENTY-FIFTH CHAPTER:
Do not laugh at a blind man nor tease a dwarf Nor injure the affairs of the lame. (xxiv 10) Do not tease a man who is in the hand of the god,41
82 The nineteenth chapter concerns honest statement in the court of law. 88 Sic, although the negative seems out of place. 84 cf. n.16 above. 85 cf. Prov. 20:22 and 27:1. 88 cf. ibid., 23:9 and 20:19. 87 cf. ibid., 1 2 : 2 3 . 88 The twenty-second chapter again advises restraint in debate. 89 cf. Prov. 23:1-3. 40 The twenty-fourth chapter advises the secretary to keep the affairs of his master in confidence. 41 The insane.
Nor be fierce of face against him if he errs. For man is clay and straw, And the god is his builder. He is tearing down and building up every day. (15) He makes a thousand poor men as he wishes, (Or) he makes a thousand men as overseers, When he is in his hour of life. How joyful is he who reaches the West, When he is safe in the hand of the god.42...
TWENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER:
Do not recognize a widow if thou catchest her in the fields,48 Nor fail to be indulgent to her reply. (xxvi 10) Do not neglect a stranger (with) thy oil-jar, That it be doubled before thy brethren. God desires respect for the poor More than the honoring of the exalted.44 . . .
THIRTIETH CHAPTER:
See thou these thirty chapters: They entertain; they instruct;45 They are the foremost of all books; They make the ignorant to know. (xxvii 10) If they are read out before the ignorant, Then he will be cleansed by them. Fill thyself with them; put them in thy heart, And be a man who can interpret them, Who will interpret them as a teacher. (15) As for the scribe who is experienced in his office, He will find himself worthy (to be) a courtier.46 (colophon:) It has come to its end In the writing of Senu, son of the God's Father Pa-miu.47 (xxviii 1)
42 Death releases a man from the helplessness of this world. The twentysixth chapter deals with respect toward elders or superiors, with the twentyseventh continuing this theme. 48 Literally: " D o not find a widow." The reference is to the poor gleaning in the fields. 44 The twenty-ninth chapter recommends appropriate etiquette for the ferryboat across the river. 45 In Prov. 22:20, the Hebrew is to be read: "Have I not written unto thee thirty (sayings) ?" 48 cf. Prov. 22:29. The special relation of "the Words of the Wise,·* Prov. 22:17-24:22, to the Wisdom of Amen-em-Opet may best be shown by Simpson's comparison of passages. Prov. 22:17-18 Amen-em-Opet 3:9-11; 3:16 (Chapter 1) 22:19 1:7 (Introductory) 22:20 27:7-8 (Chap, xxx) 22:21 1:5-6 (Introductory) 22:22 4:4-5 (Chap. 11) 22:23 no parallel 22:24 11:13-14 (Chap, ix) 22:25 13:8-9 (Chap, ix) 22:26-27 no parallel 22:28 7 : 1 2 - 1 3 (Chap, VI) 22:29 27:16-17 (Chap, xxx) 23:1-3 2 3 : 1 3 - 1 8 (Chap, XXIII)

Yet I am harnessed with a mule and must draw a wagon loaded with reeds.18 (44) I dwell in a house of asphalt and bricks, yet some clay . . . pours over me.19 (50) The life of the day before yesterday is that of any day.20 (53) You are placed into a river and your water becomes at once stinking; you are placed in an orchard and your date-fruit becomes bitter.21 (55) If the shoot is not right it will not produce the stalk, nor create seed.22 (56) Will ripe grain grow? How do we know? Will dried grain grow? How do we know?28 (57) Very soon he will be dead; (so he says), "Let me eat up (all I have)!"

Without his feeding you, can you be fat?" 18 i.e. cause and effect; cf. Amos 3:3-6. 14 cf. Matt. 6:34. The Sumerian has: "If I save, he has taken it away from you; as for that which I have increased, who will give it to you?" 15 cf. "Fine feathers make fine birds"; "Apparel makes the man." 18 cf. " D o not spur a free horse." 17 cf. Eccles. 9 : 1 1 . 18 The text is fragmentary and obscure; the translation is tentative. 19 cf. Eccles. 9:12. The Sumerian seems to mean: "In the house the asphalt was removed from the brick; . . . last year the roof drain was dripping on me." 20 The text has been restored at the end, and the translation is in part conjectural. For the meaning, cf. Eccles. 1:9-10; 3:15a. The Sumerian reads: "Out of the victuals of yesterday is what is also of today." 21 Said of a man afflicted with persistent bad luck, or of one bringing misfortune to others through the evil eye. 22 cf. "Of evil grain no good seed can come." Dr. R. J. Williams translates: "May a crooked furrow not produce a stalk! May it not yield seed!" 28 cf. Eccles. 1 : 1 5 ; 3 : 1 1 ; 7:13-14. 24 cf. Isa. 22:13. 35 This is the perennial argument adduced against pacifists. 28 cf. "Tit for tat"; "Turn about is fair play." In contrast with the preceding, this is the argument of the pacifists.

Pfeiffer, State Letters of Assyria (American Oriental Series, Vol. 6, New Haven, 1935). Chi the third of these proverbs cf. A. L. Oppenheim in BASOR, No. 107 (October, 1947), p. 9, n.6. The first and second proverbs are quoted by Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria (668-633 B-c·) a sarcastic letter to the Babylonians. In a fuller and clearer form the first proverb occurs in Ahiqar 8:17 (Syriac) and 8:14 (Arabic). "My son, you have been to me like the dog that came to the potters' oven to warm himself, and after he was warm rose up to bark at them" (Syriac). "O my son! You have been to me like the dog that was cold and went into the potters' house to get warm. And when it had got warm, it began to bark at them, and they chased it out and beat it, that it might not bite them" (Arabic). See: R. H. Charles, The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament (Oxford, 1913), Vol. 11, p. 771. The third proverb is dated to the reign of Esarhaddon (680-669 B.C.).
(1) When the potter's dog went into the oven, the potter blew on the fire inside of it.80 (2) A sinful woman at the gate of a judge's househer word prevails over that of her husband.

27 Barbershop gossip and the loquacity of barbers were proverbial long before their attestation in Hellenistic and Roman times. This proverb illustrates commonplace, ordinary, regular happenings (cf. Eccles. 1 : 5 - 1 0 ) . 28 cf. John 4:44. 29 cf. the Italian saying, "Paese che vai, usanza che trovi" (if you go into [another] country you will find [other] customs). 80 Another possible translation is, "When the potter's dog went into the oven, he even growled at the potter" (B. Meissner, Babylonien und Assyrien, Vol. 11, p. 4 2 3 ) .

As a wise man, let your understanding shine modestly, Let your mouth be restrained, guarded your speech. (20) Like a man's wealth, let your lips be precious.1 Let affront, hostility, be an abomination unto you. Speak nothing impertinent, (give no) unreliable advice. Whoever does something ugly—his head is despised. Hasten not to stand in a public assembly, Seek not the place of quarrel; For in a quarrel you must give a decision, And you will be forced to be their witness. They will fetch you to testify in a lawsuit that does not concern you. When you see a quarrel, go away without noticing it.2 (30) But if it is really your own quarrel, extinguish the flame; For a quarrel is a neglect of what is right, A protecting wall . . .

The closest parallels in the Old Testament are Ex. 23:4-5; Prov. 2 4 : 1 7 - 1 8 ; 25:21-22; Job 31:29-30; cf. Lev. 19:18; Prov. 24:29; Ecclus. 28:2; Tobit 4:15.

Do not marry a harlot whose husbands are six thousand. (obverse 23) An Ishtar-woman vowed to a god, A sacred prostitute whose favors are unlimited, Will not lift you out of your trouble: In your quarrel she will slander you.5 Reverence and submissiveness are not with her. Truly, if she takes possession of the house, lead her out Toward the path of a stranger she turns her mind. (30) Or the house which she enters will be destroyed, her husband will not prosper.6 (reverse i) My son, if it be his will, you belong to the prince: Guard his seal, bind it to your person\ Open his treasury, enter therein, For before you no stranger was ever there. Wealth without measure you will see therein; (But) to any such thing do not turn your eye, Do not let your mind consider doing something stealthy, For eventually the matter will be investigated. And whatever stealthy action you have done will become manifest; (40) The prince will hear of it, [will punish you]. (42-47) (reverse A) Do not slander, speak what is fine. Speak no evil, tell what is good. Whoever slanders (or) speaks evil, As a retribution the god Shamash will pursue after his head. (30) Open not wide your mouth, guard your lips; The words of your inner self do not speak (even) when alone. What you now speak hastily you will later take back, And you should cause your mind to refrain by its efforts from speech.7 Pay homage daily to your god With sacrifice, prayer, and appropriate incense-offering. Towards your god you should feel solicitude of heart: That is what is appropriate to the deity. Prayer, supplication, and prostration to the ground Shall you offer in the morning: then your might will be great, (40) And in abundance, through god's help, you will prosper.8 In your learning examine the tablet. (reverse B) Reverence (for the deity) produces well-being, (1) Sacrifice prolongs life, And prayer atones for sin.

Aramaic Proverbs and Precepts
(Translator: H. L. Ginsberg)
THE WORDS OF AHIQAR
The text is preserved as the more recent writing on eleven sheets of palimpsest papyrus of the late fifth century B.C. recovered by German excavators from the debris of Elephantine, Upper Egypt, in the years 1906-7. T h e first four papyri, with a total of five columns, contain the story of Ahiqar, which is in the first person; the remaining seven, with a total of nine columns, contain Ahiqar's sayings. The composition of the work may antedate the preserved copy by as much as a century. The action of the narrative centers about the court of the Assyrian kings Sennacherib (704-681) and Esarhaddon (680669). Of other persons named therein, Nabusumiskun actually was a high official of Sennacherib, and Ahiqar himself may be a reflex of Adadsumusur, a priest who officiated in the reigns of Sennacherib and Esarhaddon and exerted a certain amount of influence over them. All of the proper names fit well into an Assyrian milieu. For the sayings, too, a Mesopotamian origin is indicated by repeated references to Shamash as god of justice. Prior to the recovery of the old Aramaic text, several postChristian recensions of the book of Ahiqar were known, the Syriac one being the oldest. The man Ahiqar is mentioned in the book of Tobit (1:22; 14:10; etc.). Text and translation: Sachau, Pis. 40-50 (translation, pp. 147182). Editions: Ungnad, 50-63 (pp. 62-82); Cowley, pp. 204248.

W . von Soden, ZA, XLIII (1936), 9-13. Columns i-ii (lines 1-31) are too defective for smooth translation. In them Ahiqar \'hyqr) relates how, having grown old piloting the Assyrian ship of state throughout the reign of Sennacherib, and being without a son of his own, he adopted and instructed his sister's son Nadin and then persuaded Esarhaddon to make him his (Ahiqar's) successor; whereupon Nadin requited his foster-father's kindness with calumny.
(iii 32-48) Then [Esa]rhaddon, the king of Assyria, [answered] and said: "[Do you, Nabusumiskun on\t of my father's officers, who [ate] of my father's bread, seek [the old man Ahiqar] wherever you may find [and kill him]. Otherwise this old man [Ah]iq[ar] is a wise scribe [and counselor of all Assy]ria, and is liable to corrupt the land against us." Then, when [the king of As]syria [had spoken thus], he appointed with him 2 other men to see how [it would turn out]. So this officer [Nab]usumiskun [went away] riding on a swif[t h]orse, [and those men] with him. Then, after three more d[a]ys, [he and the o]thers who were with him s[ighted me] as I was walking among the vineyards. [Now when this] officer [Nab]usumiskun [beheld me] he [straig]htway rent his mantle and moaned, "[Are you] the wise scribe and man of good counsel,

who [was a righteous] man [and b]y whose counsel and words all of Assyria was guided ? 'Extinguished be [the lamp1 of your son whom you brought] up, whom you set up at the gate of the palace. He has ruined you, and an [evil] return [is it." Th]en I, Ahiqar, was afraid. I answered and said to [that officer] Nabusum[iskun, "Am] I [not] the same Ahiqar who once saved you from an undeserved death? [When Sennacherib], the father of this King Esarhaddon, sought to [kill you, th]en I brought you to my house. There I sustained you (iv 49-63) as a man deals with his brother, having hidden you from him and having said 'I killed him,' until at a la[ter] tim[e] and after many days I brought you before King Sennacherib and cleared you of offenses before him and he did you no evi[l]. Moreover, Sennacherib was well pleased with me for having kept you alive and not having killed you. Now do you do to me even as I did to you. Don't kill me. Take me to your house until other times. King Esarhaddon is merciful as any man(?). In the end he will remember me and wish for my advice. Th[e]n you will [prese]nt me to him and he will spare me alive." Then the officer Nabusumiskun [answered] and said, "Fear not, my [lord] Ahiqar, father of all Assyria, by whose counsel King Sennacherib and (all) the host of Assyria (were guided)!" Then the officer Nabusumiskun said to his companions, those two men that were with him, "[Do you lis]ten [and pay attention] to me while I tell you [my] plan, and a [very] good plan it is." S[o] those [men answered] and said t[o him. "Te]ll us, O officer Nabusumiskun, what [ever you will, and we shall listen to] you." The [of]ficer Nabusumiskun then spoke and said to them, "Listen to me. This is [Ahi]qar. He [is] a great man [and a bearer of the se]al of [King] Esarhaddon, and the whole army of [Assy]ria was guided by his counsel and words. Let us not kill him [undeservedly]. I will give you [a] eunuch [slave] of mine. Let him be slain bet[ween these] two mountains instead of this Ahiqar. Whe[n it is reported, and] the king [se]nds other [m]en [af]ter us to see the body of this Ahiqar, then [they'll see the bod]y of [th]is eunuch slave of mine, (v 64-78) In the end [King] Esarhaddon [will remember Ahiqar and desire his advice] and he will [regret etc.]."
(Since only the right half—or less than half—of col. v is preserved, its translation involves too much conjecture. It is, however, certain that Nabusumiskun's companions agree to his plan, and Nabusumiskun secretly maintains Ahiqar in his house as Ahiqar once maintained Nabusumiskun. The latter and his two companions report to Esarhaddon that they have slain Ahiqar. The rest of the story is missing altogether. We know from the later recensions that eventually the king did, in fact, miss Ahiqar's advice sorely and was overjoyed to learn that he was still alive, and that Ahiqar was rehabilitated while Nadin got his deserts.)

Egyptian Observations
(Translator: John A. Wilson)
THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES OF PHARAOH
The king of Egypt ruled the land as a god, as the Son of Re, or as the Horus, or as the incorporation of the deities of Upper and Lower Egypt. He was also a synthesis of other gods who represented forces of proper rule, a blend of force and intelligence, of terror and nurture, or of sustenance and punishment. The following poem sets forth some of the divine elements which went into the composition of a pharaoh. It is framed as a father's instruction to his children on right living: if they faithfully serve so great a god, they will prosper. The stela of Sehetep-ib-Re, Chief Treasurer under pharaoh Ni-maat-Re (Amen-em-het III, about 1840-1790 B.C.) of the Twelfth Dynasty, was found at Abydos, and is now Cairo Museum 20538. It was published by H. O. Lange and H. Schafer, Grab- und Den\steine des mittleren Reichs (Catalogue ginSral ... du Musee du Caire, Berlin, 1902-08), n, 145-49, PI· XL> and by K. Sethe, Aegyptische hesestuc\e (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1928), 68-70. Ch. Kuentz's study in Studies Presented to F. LI. Griffith (London, 1932), 97-110, brought forth a parallel perhaps six centuries later. Translated in Erman, LAE, 84-85.*
The beginning of the instruction which he made for his children.
I tell something important And cause that ye hear (it). I cause that ye know a counsel of eternity And a manner of living aright1 (10) And for passing a lifetime in peace. Worship King Ni-maat-Re, living forever, within your bodies And associate with his majesty in your hearts. He is Perception which is in (men's) hearts,2 And his eyes search out every body. He is Re, by whose beams one sees, He is one who illumines the Two Lands more than the sun disc. He is one who makes the land greener than (does) a high Nile, For he has filled the Two Lands with strength and life. The nostrils are chilled when he inclines toward rage, (But) when he is merciful, (they) will breathe the air.8 He gives food to them who are in his service, And he supplies them who tread his path. (15) The king is a
1 "Aright," ni mdau, is a play on the name of the pharaoh, Ni-ma'at-Re. 2 "Cognitive intelligence" or "Perception" was an attribute of personality deified as the god Sia. It was particularly an attribute of good rule. 3 A favorite device was to set terror and kindliness in juxtaposition as components of rule. 4 Ka "vital force," or protecting and sustaining "soul," or "fortune," etc. —the other self which supported a man. cf. p. 3, n.4 above. Here the pharaoh is the k.a of his people.
And his mouth is increase.5 He who is to be is his creation, (For) he is the Khnum of all bodies," The begetter who creates the people. He is the Bastet who protects the Two Lands;7 He who worships him will be one whom his arm shelters. He is Sekhmet against him who transgresses his command; He whom he hates will bear woes.8 Fight on behalf of his name, And be scrupulous in the oath to him, (That) ye may be free from a taint of disloyalty. He whom the king has loved will be a revered one, (But) there is no tomb for a rebel against his majesty, And his corpse is cast into the water. If ye do this, your persons shall be unblemishedYe will find it (so) forever. (20)
IN PRAISE OF LEARNED SCRIBES
The Egyptian Empire built up a large bureaucracy. A constant theme of the writings for schoolboys in that period deals with the high standing and privileges of the secretarial profession. T h e following extract sets forth the advantages of learning in terms of the immortality of great writings. In that respect it stands in contrast to the Song of the Harper (p. 467), where the theme was the powerlessness of the ancient sages to leave a standing memorial. The Song of the Harper was addressed to an occasion of entertainment, whereas the present text was a call to more diligent application to studies.

BE A SCRIBE, PUT IT IN THY HEART, that thy name
may fare (iii 1) similarly. More effective is a book than a decorated tombstone or an established tomb-wall. Such things make buildings and pyramids for the sake of pronouncing their names. Without doubt a name in the mouth of men is of benefit in the necropolis. A MAN is PERISHED, his corpse is dust, all his relatives are come to the ground—(but) it is writing that makes him remembered in the mouth of a reciter. More effective is a book than the house of the builder or tombs in the West. It is better than a (well-) founded castle or a stela (5) in a temple.
Is THERE (ANYONE) HERE LIKE Hor-dedef? Is there
another like Ii-em-hotep? None has appeared among our relatives like Neferti or Khety, that foremost of them. I cause thee to know the names of Ptah-emDjedhuti and Kha-kheper-(Re)-seneb. Is there another like Ptah-hotep, or Ka-iris as well ?4 THESE LEARNED MEN
WHO FORETOLD WHAT WAS TO COME, that which issued

Though they concealed their magic (10) from everybody (else), it may be read in a (book of) wisdom. Though they are gone and their names are forgotten, it is writing that makes them remembered.
THE SATIRE ON THE TRADES
Egyptian schoolboys who were learning to write frequently had to copy the classics which extolled the profession of the scribe, to die disparagement of other vocations. One of the popular models under the Empire was the Satire on the Trades, which details the wretchedness of nonscribal activities. The
1 The lector priest and the "son-he-loves" performed die funerary rites which beatified and maintained the deceased. 2 A stone ostracon? • Because they were dependent upon the scribe's writings. 4 We know a surprising number of these famed sages. Hor-dedef and Ii-em-hotep are the traditional wise men (pp. 31, n.6 above; 467, n.4; 476, n.16 below). Khety, the son of Duauf, is credited with the much-copied Satire on the Trades (pp. 432-434 below). A lament by Kha-kheper-Reseneb is on a writing board now in the British Museum (A. H. Gardiner, The Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage [Leipzig, 1909], 95 ff.). The Vizier Ptah-hotep was the author credited with one of the earliest books of wisdom (pp. 412-414). Ka-iris is unknown. Neferti is very probably the prophet commonly called Nefer-rohu (pp. 444-446 below). It is tempting to emend Ptah-em-Djedhuti into Djed-Djehuti invoked in literary controversy (cf. Gardiner's comment following his translation of the (»resent text). 6 Sic, read "their."
unhappy schoolboys who made the extant copies mangled the text so thoroughly that translation is often uncertain. The documents are numerous, most of them from the Nineteenth Dynasty (1350-1200 B.C.) and most of them fragmentary. There are clear indications that the lost original derived from the Middle Kingdom or earlier (2150-1750 B.C.). In whole or in part, the text occurs on 3 papyri (Papyrus Sallier II = British Museum 10182; Papyrus Anastasi VII = British Museum 10222; Papyrus Chester Beatty X I X = British Museum 10699); 1 writing tablet (Louvre 693); and more than 90 ostraca. T h e present translation was made from as many of these documents as were available to the translator; the line numbers follow Sallier II. The text has commonly been called the "Instruction of Duauf," but the author was apparendy a Khety, as Gardiner pointed out in Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Third Series. Chester Beatty Gift, 1, 40, n . i *
A recent study of the hieratic texts is by Hellmut Brunner, Die Lehre des Cheü, Sohnes des Duauf (Münchner ägyptolo
gische Forschungen, N0. 13; Glückstadt, 1944), with transcription, translation, and commentary. There is a translation in Erman, LAE, 67-72. Other Egyptian texts which might have been included under this heading are the statement of a creation in terms of equal opportunity for all men (pp. 7-8 above); the two didactic tales of pp. 405-410 above; the Song of the Harper (p. 467 below);
and the song on the happiness of the dead (pp. 33-34 above).
(iii 9) T H E BEGINNING OF THE INSTRUCTION WHICH a
man of the ship's cabin, whose name was Duauf's son Khety, made for his son, (whose) name was Pepy, as he was journeying upstream (iv i) (to) the Residence City, to put him into the Writing School among the children of officials, in the lower part of the Residence
City.1 T H E N HE SAID TO HIM:
I have seen how the belabored man is belabored—thou shouldst set thy heart in pursuit of writing. And I have observed how one may be rescued from his dutiesbehold, there is nothing which surpasses writing. . . . Read thou at the end of the Conclusion.2 Thou wilt find this statement in it, to wit: "As for the scribe, every place of his is at the Residence City, and he will not be poor in it. (But) if he uses the wisdom of someone else, he will not come out successfully." Thus have I seen the professions: they are in the meaning of this statement (5) on it. I shall make thee love writing more than thy (own) mother; (thus) I shall make beauty enter before thy face. Moreover, it is greater than any (other) office; there is not its like in the land. If he* began to prosper when he was (only) a child, men greet him (respectfully). If some one sends him to carry out an errand, he does not return (only) that he may clothe himself in the (workman's) apron.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SCULPTOR ON AN ERRAND n o r a

1 Khety imparted the advice during the journey south to the Capital, where he was putting his son into the government's secretarial training school. Khety and his son Pepy are apparently of no high degree. It is not dear whether "man of the ship's cabin" is the father's title or his location as be gave die advice. 2 Either the title of a well-known book of advice, or the conclusion of this text in its general purport. The word occurs again in Papyrus Beatty IV, verso vi 11 (Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Third Series. Chester Beatty Gift, i, 43; n, PI. 20):—(Readers) "have all beatified my name (when coming) near the conclusion.*** » T h e scribe.



OBSERVATIONS ON LI
t
the metalworker at his work at the mouth of his furnace. His fingers were somewhat like crocodiles;4 he stank more than fish-roe.
EVERY CRAFTSMAN T H A T WIELDS T H E ADZE, he is wearier
than a hoeman. His field is the wood, and his job is the metal. At night, though he is released, he does more (v i) than his arms can (really) do. At night he has to stri1{e a light.
T H E FASHIONER OF COSTLY STONES SEEKS FOR SKILL in
every (kind of) hard stone. When he has fully completed things, his arms are destroyed, and he is weary. When he sits down at the going in of Re,5 his thighs and his back are cramped.
T H E BARBER IS (STILL) SHAVING AT THE END OF DUSK.
When he gives himself up to chins, he puts himself upon his (own) shoulder.6 He gives himself from street to street, to seek out those whom he may shave. Thus if he is valiant his arms will fill his belly, (5) like a bee eating for its work.
T H E ITINERANT MERCHANT SAILS DOWNSTREAM TO
the Delta to get trade for himself. When he has done more than his arms can (really) do, the gnats have slain him, the sand flies have made him miserably miserable. Then there is inflammation.
T H E SMALL BUILDING CONTRACTOR CARRIES MUD.7 . . .
He is dirtier than vines or pigs, from treading under his mud. His clothes are stiff with clay; his leather belt is going to ruin. Entering into the wind, he is miserable. His lamp goes out, though (still) in good condition. He pounds with his feet; he crushes with his own self, muddying the court of every house, when the water of the streets has flooded.
( v i 1) L E T ME TELL THEE ALSO OF THE BUILDER OF
WALLS. His sides ache, since he must be outside in a treacherous wind. He builds in an apron, while he is girt with lotuses of the workshop, at a distance from his rear.8 His arms are destroyed with technical work; every calculation of his is different® What he eats is the bread of his fingers,10 and he washes himself (only)
once a season. H E IS SIMPLY WRETCHED THROUGH AND
THROUGH. . . . As for (5) food, he must give it to his house, for his children are very many.
T H E GARDENER BRINGS VEGETABLES, both his shoul
ders being under . . . upon his neck. Early in the morning he must water the vegetables and in the evening the vines "The sand fly of his mother" is his name, "the sheikh of every profession."11
T H E TENANT-FARMER, HIS RECKONINGS (GO ON) FOR
EVER.12 His voice is louder (than) the abu-bird. . . .
4 "His fingers were like a thing of crocodiles"; they were tough and wrinkled. 5 At sunset? 6 Has to carry his own heavy responsibility to earn a living? 7 To make mud-bricks. 8 Since we do not know the meaning of "lotuses of the workshops," we cannot say how his costume was absurd. * He loses count of his bricks or his measurements. 10 For lack of food, he gnaws his fingers? 11 Sarcastic designations, which have a general similarity of phrasing to those of the modern Arab world. 12 He must always render account to his landlord.
E A N D W O R L D ORDER 433
Wearier is he than a wayfarer of the Delta. Yet he is (vii 1) a picked man: his safety is a safety from lions.18 His sides ache, as if heaven and earth were in them. When he goes forth thence from the meadows and he reaches his home in the evening, he is one cut down by traveling.
T H E WEAVER IN THE WORKSHOPS, he is worse than a
woman, with his thighs against his belly. He cannot breathe the (open) air. If he cuts short the day of weaving, he is beaten with fifty thongs. He must give food to the doorkeeper to let him see the light of day. T H E ARROW-MAKER, he is very miserable as he goes out (5) into the desert.14 Greater is that which he gives to his donkey than its work thereafter (is worth). Great is that which he gives to him who is in the meadows, who sets him on the way. When he reaches his home in the evening, the traveling has cut him down.
T H E COURIER GOES OUT TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY, after
he has made over his property to his children, being afraid of lions and Asiatics. And what of him, when he is in Egypt? When he arrives thence from the meadows and he reaches his home in the evening, the traveling has cut him down. His house is (only) an apron of brick.15 He does not return happy of heart.
T H E EMBALMER, HIS FINGERS ARE FOUL, for the odor
thereof is (that of) corpses. His eyes burn from the greatness of the heat, (viii i) He could not oppose his (own) daughter.16 He spends the day cutting up old rags,17 so that clothing is an abomination to him.
T H E COBBLER, HE IS VERY BADLY OFF, carrying his equip
ment forever. His safety is a safety from corpses, as he bites into the leather.18
T H E LAUNDRYMAN LAUNDERS ON THE (RIVER) BANK, a
neighbor of the crocodile. When a father comes out of the greasy waters, he could not oppose his (own) daughter. There are no satisfying jobs in thy sight, O sheikh of every profession!19 He is mixed up by the differences in his accounts. . . . When he puts (5) on the apron of a woman, then he is in woe. I weep for him, spending the day under the rod
T H E BIRD-CATCHER, H E IS VERY MISERABLE, when he
looks at the denizens of the sky. If marsh-fowl pass by in the heavens, then he says: "Would that (I had) a net!", (but) god does not let (it) happen to him, being neglectful of his affairs.
L E T ME TELL THEE ALSO OF THE FISH-CATCHER. He is
more miserable than any (other) profession. Behold, there is nothing his work on the river, mingled with the crocodiles. If there is a cutting down in the total of the official registerTM then there is complaint. He
13 A heavy-handed jibe at the peaceful farmer. 14 To get flint points. 15 The text may be corrupt. If the translation is approximately correct, it means that his house has become a mere shell in his absence. 16 Is too weak from weariness to stand up to a girl ? 17 For strips with which to wrap mummies. 18 May he have only animal hides to bite on. 19 cf. n . u above. 20 Of fish due the government.

cannot (even) say: "A crocodile is (ix i) waiting (there)," for fear has made him blind.41... Behold, there is no profession free of a boss—except for the scribe: he is the boss.
BUT IF THOU KNOWEST WRITING, then it will go better with thee than (in) these professions which I have set before thee. . . . Behold, it is done in journeying upstream to the Residence City; behold, it is done for love of thee. A day in school is of advantage to thee. The eternity of its work is (like that of) the mountains. It is: "Quick (5) quick}"—(so) I let thee know
LET ME TELL THEE ALSO OTHER MATTERS, to teach thee what thou shouldst know. . . . IF THOU GOEST TO THE REAR OF OFFICIALS, approach (only) at a distance after a (decent interval'). If thou enterest in, while a householder is in his house and his activity is for some one else before thee, as thou sittest with thy hand to thy mouth, do not ask for something beside him. Thou shouldst act according to what he says to thee, by guarding (thy) speech at the dining table.
BE DIGNIFIED, (YET) BE NOT UNDER AWE when speaking (x i) words of reserve—he who hides his belly (is) one who makes a shield for himself—or when speaking words of boldness when one sits with thee in hostility. IF THOU GOEST FORTH FROM THE SCHOOL, after midday
is announced to thee, and goest rollicking in the street, men dispute with thee in the end. It is not for thee.
If an official sends thee on an errand, say it (just) as he said it; do not take away or add to it. He who leaves (things done) creates jubilation (One) trusts in every good characteristic of his. There is nothing hidden from him; there is no separating him from any place of his. . . . (5) . . . How wretched it is, the belly which thou heedest! If three loaves should satisfy thee, and the swallowing of two hin of beer, (but) there is (still) no limit [to] the belly, fight against it
BEHOLD, IT IS GOOD THAT THOU SEND AWAY THE MULTITUDE AND HEAR the words of officials ( o n l y ) . . . . When the scribe has been seen to listen, listening becomes a heroic quality. Thou shouldst combat words which may be against it.22 Let thy legs hasten as thou goest, (or) it cannot (xi 1) be attained. Associate with him who leads the way to it, and make friends with a man of thy (own) generation.
BEHOLD, I HAVE SET THEE ON THE WAY of god.28 The Renenut of a scribe is on his shoulder on the day of his birth.24 He reaches the halls of the magistrates, when he has become a man. Behold, there is no scribe who lacks food, from the property of the House of the Kinglife, prosperity, health! Meskhenet is (the source of) the scribe's welfare,25 he being set before the magistrates.
21 He is so blinded by fear of crocodiles that no one will believe his excuses for not delivering a full quota of fish. 22 In this context "it" means "hearing," the respectful obedience of the scribe to higher authority. 23 Only one text so, whereas three texts have: "Behold, Renenut is on the way of god," which we take to be a corruption affected by the following sentence. 24 Slaves were branded with the master's name. Renenut, the harvestgoddess, was a goddess of fortune. Thus, the good fortune of a scribe was fixed for him from birth. 25 Meskhenet was a goddess of birth and destiny.
His father and his mother praise god, he being set upon the way of the living. Behold these things—I (have set them) before thee and thy children's children. (5) It has come to a happy ending in success . . . .

. . . I have become like a deaf man. ( 1 1 1 ) .. . Once I behaved like a lord, now I have become a slave (13) The fury of my companions destroys me.
The day is sighing, the night is weeping; (20) The month is silence, mourning is the year.
•··
I have arrived, I have passed beyond life's span. ( H i ) I look about me: evil upon evil! My affliction increases, right I cannot find. I implored the god, but he did not turn his countenance; I prayed to my goddess, but she did not raise her head. The diviner through divination did not discern the situation. Through incense-offering the dream-interpreter did not explain my right. I turned to the necromancer, but he did not enlighten me. The conjurer through magic did not dispel the wrath against me. Whence come the evil things everywhere ? (10) I looked backwards: persecution, woe! Like one who did not offer a libation to a god, And at meal-time did not invoke a goddess, Who did not bow his face and did not know reverence, In whose mouth prayer and supplication ceased, For whom the holiday had been eliminated, the eisesu1 festival has been curtailed, Who became negligent, despised their images,
1 The elirfu festival was celebrated on the 4th, 8th and 17th day of the month.



O B S E R V A T I O N S O N L I F E A N D W O R L D ORDER 435
Who did not tcach his people religion and reverence, Who did not remember his god, although eating his food, Who forsook his goddess and did not offer her a libation; (20) Nay, worse than one who became proud and forgot his (divine) lord, Who swore frivolously in the name of his honorable deity—like such a one have I become! Yet I myself was thinking only of prayer and supplication: Supplication was my concern, sacrifice my rule; The day of the worship of the gods was my delight, The day of my goddess' procession was my profit and wealth. Veneration of the king was my joy, And I enjoyed music in his honor. I taught my land to observe the divine ordinances, To honor the name of the goddess I instructed my people. (30) The king's majesty I equated to that of a god, And reverence for the (royal) palace I inculcated in the troops. Oh that I only knew that these things are well pleasing to a god! What is good in one's sight is evil for a god. What is bad in one's own mind is good for his god. Who can understand the counsel of the gods in the midst of heaven ? The plan of a god is deep waters, who can comprehend it? Where has befuddled mankind ever learned what a god's conduct is ? He who was living yesterday has died today: Instantly he is made gloomy, suddenly is he crushed. (40) One moment he sings a happy song, And in an instant he will moan like a mourner. Like day and night their mood changes. When they are hungry they resemble corpses, When they are sated they rival their god; In good luck they speak of ascending to heaven, When they are afflicted they grumble about going down to the underworld.
An evil ghost has come from its abyss, (53) . . . a headache has come out from Ekur.2 The... [demon] has descended from the (underworld) mountain.

2 Ekur (meaning "mountain house") the great temple of Enlil at Nippur, is used here in the sense of the underworld.
Like a sungirtu (water plant) I was torn away and cast on my belly. The al& (disease demon) has clothed himself with my body as with a garment. Like a net, sleep has covered me. My eyes stare without seeing. My ears are open without hearing. Faintness has seized my whole body. (10) A stroke has fallen upon my flesh. Weakness has taken hold of my hand. Weariness has fallen upon my knees.

Death [pursued me] and covered my whole body. If someone asking for me calls me, I do not answer. My people weep, I myself no longer exist. In my mouth a gag is placed, I hold back the word of my lips. (20)

Wheat, even though putrid, I eat. Beer—life divine!—I have eliminated from me. Extremely long has lasted the distress. Through starving my appearance.... My flesh is flaccid, my blood is [going]. My bones are smashed.... My muscles are inflamed . . . . I took the bed to the jail, they have blocked (my) exit. (30) My prison—that is what my house has become. My hands have been cast into fetters—(i.e.) my flesh; Into my own chains have my feet been thrown. My wheals are sore, the wound is serious. The lash striking me is filled with terror. They have pierced me with a goad, the sting was fierce. All day a pursuer pursues me. At night he does not let me draw my breath for a moment. Through straining my sinews have been loosened, My limbs are wrecked, hit aside. (40) I spend the night in my dung, like an ox. I was soaked like a sheep in my excrements. My arthritis baffled the conjurer, And my omens confused the diviner. The enchanter has not determined the condition of my illness, And the time (of the end) of my malady the diviner did not give (me). No god helped, (none) seized my hand; My goddess showed no mercy, she did not come to my side. While the grave was still open they took possession of my jewels, Before I was dead the weeping (for me) was ended. (50) All my land said, "How sad!"3 My ill-wisher heard it, and his countenance shone (with joy);
8 Another possible translation, instead of "How sad!" is "How has he been mistreated!"

They brought the good news to the woman who was my ill-wisher, and her spirit4 was delighted.

A DIALOGUE ABOUT HUMAN MISERY1
Cuneiform text: J. A. Craig, Babylonian and Assyrian Religious Texts, Vol. 1 (Assyriologische Bibliothe\, XIII [Leipzig,
2 The following gloss has been added in the cuneiform text: "well—pitfall, ditch." Woman (and more specifically the wife) is compared to a well (Hebrew, be'Br) and to a cistern (Hebrew, bor) in Prov. 5 : 1 5 , cf. 5:16-18; Cant. 4:15. H. Graetz and others after him propose to read, "Remember thy cistern (bSre^ha)" or "thy well (Hebrew, be'ere\ha)" instead of "thy creator" (Hebrew, bor'akha) in Eccles. 1 2 : 1 , interpreting, "remember thy w i f e . " The Akkadian btirtu (used here) means well and cistern, and is a cognate of the two Hebrew words in Prov. 5 : 1 5 . 8 A variant text reads: "His barley is barley immense (in quantity)." 4 The variant of lines 73b-76 reads, " H e eats your barley, they will diminish the interest on your barley, and besides they will curse you." 5 The tablets listing men's deeds were stored in Marduk's bowl. e c f . Eccles. 1 :i 1: 2:14-16; 6:8; 9:1-6; etc.; Ps. 49:10 (Hebr. 4 9 : 1 1 ) ; Job 21:26.
1 This poem is sometimes called "The Babylonian Ecclesiastes." The cuneiform text is an acrostic poem. Each of the eleven verses, comprising one of the 27 partially extant stanzas, begins with the same syllable, as in Ps. 1 1 9 each of the eight distichs of each stanza begins with the same letter of the alphabet. T h e acrostic reads: a-na-ku [ia]-ag-gi-il-\i-\i-na-am\-ubbi-ib ma-ai-ma-iu k.a-ri-\bu] la i-li u iar-ri, " I , Shaggil-kinam-ubbib, the conjurer, bless god and king." The poet's name preserved in this acrostic means, "O Esagil (i.e. the temple of Marduk in Babylon), pronounce the righteous pure!" The extant tablets on which the poem is written are

(10) My father and my mother forsook me, and I had no guardian. My respected friend, what you said is grief! (II) What you caused your beloved heart to meditate is evil! Your clever understanding you made similar to that of an imbecile; Your radiant features you turned into darkness. (The humans) are given up, may they go the way of death. "You shall cross the (underworld) river Hubur," they were told long ago. If you look, people are uniformly dull. The wealthy man . . . they have glorified eagerly, (But) who ever favored the radiant just man?

Let me not crave property.... Let me forget the votive gifts of the god, trample upon ritual prescriptions.
Let me slaughter the bullocks... eat.
Let me go to a fortress, reach distant places. Let me open a spring, free the flow (of water), A spring of the steppe, let me wander about, Let me enter house after house, control my hunger, (140) Let me camp in the fields, hunt along the highways, Let me [enter] in like a beggar The necklace, the beauty of which you craved, ( X X I I 2 3 5 ) . . . his legs, quickly he was lost. The godless, the scoundrel, who has acquired wealth, The murderer (with) his weapon pursues him. You, who do not seek the counsel of the god, what is your success? Whoever draws the yoke of the god, verily . . . his food (supply) is constant. (240) Seek (then) the good breath of the gods, And what you have lost this year you will recover at once. Among men I have made observations, (but) the signs were variable. (XXIII) The god does not stop the advance of the larrabu-demon. In the canals the begetter draws the ship, (While) his first-born lies in bed; The oldest brother moves about on his way like a lion, (While) the second son delights in driving a mule. In the street the senior son hunts disgracefully (for plunder), (While) the second son distributes food to the needy. (250) In the presence of a leader I, who humble myself, what do I gain? I must submit (even) to my slave·. The wealthy and thriving man despises me,—the last (of all). (O) wise (and) strong one, endowed with insight, ( X X I V ) Your heart is eating itself (when) you treat God unjusdy. The mind of the god, like the center of the heavens, is remote; His knowledge is difficult, men cannot understand it. The product of the hand of the goddess Aruru is life in general. The premature offspring is always thin: A cow's first heifer is inferior, (260) Her second offspring is twice as large. The fool gives birth to an outstanding son, The mighty hero to one whose designation is quite different. Let him know (that) people cannot understand what the counsel of a god is.
Give heed, my friend! Understand my
meanings ( X X V ) Guard the choice expression of my speech. (People) extol the word of a prominent man, expert in murder, (But) they abase the humble, who has committed no violence. They justify the evildoer, whose iniquity is . . . , (But) they drive away the righteous, who gives [heed] to the god's counsel. (270) They fill with precious metal the of the bandit, (But) they empty of food the larder of the helpless man. They strengthen the mighty man, whose retinue is [wic\ed\
(But) they ruin the weakling, they cast down the feeble. Even me, helpless (as I am), the upstart persecutes. The primeval king, the god Naru,8 creator of mankind, ( X X V I ) The glorious god Zulummaru,4 who nipped off their clay, The queen who formed them, the divine lady Mama,* They bestowed upon humanity ingenious speech: Falsehood and untruth they conferred upon them forever. (280) Enthusiastically they speak of the rich mati's graciousness, "He is a king! His tutelary deities go at his side!" As if he were a thief, they mistreat a wretched man, They bestow slander on him, they plot murder against him, Disloyally they bring every evil upon him because he lacks protection;
Dreadfully they destroy him, they extinguish him like a flame. Be merciful, my friend: listen to my woe! ( X X V I I ) Help me! See (my) misery, and you will truly understand. A wise and imploring slave am I. Help and encouragement I have not experienced for an instant. (290) I walked quiedy through the squares of my city, My voice was never loud, my speech was low; I did not raise my head, I looked (down) at the ground.
Like a slave I was not glorified in the assembly of [my peers].
May the god Ninurta, w h o . . . , supply help! May the goddess Ishtar, w h o . . . , have mercy upon me! May the shepherd,8 the sun of the people,8 [have mercy],

Oracles and Prophecies
Egyptian Oracles and Prophecies
(Translator: John A. Wilson)
THE ADMONITIONS OF IPU-WER
The following text is "prophetic" in a biblical sense. The "prophet" is not foretelling the future but is standing before a pharaoh and condemning die past and present administration of Egypt The manuscript is too fragmentary for a full, connected sense. It seems clear, however, that Egypt had suffered a breakdown of government, accompanied by social and economic chaos. These calamities met with indifference in the palace. A certain Ipu-wer, about whom nothing is known apart from the surviving text, appeared at the palace and reported to the pharaoh the anarchy in the land. Ipu-wer first was inclined to absolve the pharaoh of guilt for these woes, but grew more bold and ended with a denunciation of the king who evaded his responsibilities. Although our manuscript was written in the Nineteenth or Twentieth Dynasty (1350-1100 B.C.), the original belonged to an earlier time, perhaps to the period between the Old and Middle Kingdoms (2300-2050 B.C.). T h e language and orthography are "Middle Egyptian." T h e situation described conforms to that which followed the breakdown of the central government at the end of the Old Kingdom. T h e pharaoh who is denounced is not named, but may have been one of the last rulers of the Sixth Dynasty or one of the kings of the weak dynasties following* The beginning and end of the manuscript are missing, and the body of the text is full of lacunae. Only extracts may be given here. T h e lost beginning of the text probably gave the narrative setting of Ipu-wer's arrival in court and the reasons for his speeches. Leyden Papyrus I 344, recto, was facsimiled in C. Leemans, Monumens egyptiens du Musie d'antiquitis des Pays-Bas ä Leide (Leyden, 1841-82), 11, Pis. cv-cxm. T h e significance of the text was first presented by H. O. Lange, Prophezeiungen eines ägyptischen Weisen ( S P A W , 1903, 601-10). T h e definitive study of the text is still that of A. H. Gardiner, The Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage (Leipzig, 1909). T h e text is translated in Erman, LAE, 92-108. T h e significance of the text was studied by J. H. Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience ( N e w York, 1933), 193-200*

But it may also mean that Ipu-wer was the first to tell the pharaoh about the sad state of the land. 15 With the frontier policing ineffective, the security of the Delta was broken by invaders. 16 "Have power-rights over their mouths." 17 Or "are taken away." The restricted area of the administration had civil and religious writings which were not open to the ordinary public, cf. the following stanzas. 18 Magic known to everybody was no longer magic. The tentative translation assumes that there were two kinds of magic charms, one beginning with the word "go," the other with the word "enfold." 19 Or "their inventories are taken away."

The statement may have been intended to implicate the pharaoh indirecdy. The passage is in place here. It is an inapt quotation in the Instruction of King Amen-em-het (p. 419 above). 28 A section in which the stanzas are introduced by a different rubricized word, "Behold." In place of an attitude of surprised protest, Ipu-wer now brings his charges closer home to the palace. 24 The next stanza makes this explicit as the robbing of royal tombs. But there is an implicit attack here on the king who heard the words for his failure to preserve former order. 25 "Men who know not plans." 26 The serpent on the brow of the king, and thus the symbol of kingship. 27 The "secret" was the awful mystery and inviolability of the god who was pharaoh of Egypt, cf. the following stanza. 28 The deified snake which was the guardian of a temple or a palace. 29 The sense seems to be that those directly responsible to the king are

running wild in appropriating the property of ordinary citizens. Ipu-wer is now directing his criticism closer to the person of the king. 30 Probably thereby making a profit on a contracted obligation. 31 Another series of stanzas, each beginning with the word "destroyed," describes further chaos. This section is too damaged for connected translation. 32 cf. n.21 above. 33 In the section which follows, each stanza begins with the word "remember," recalling the pious observations of the past as the necessary norm for the future. 34 Moistening the head, like cleansing the mouth with natron-water, was probably some kind of purificatory rite. 85 "The horizon" was the temple. 36 In context full of lacunae there is a transition to a new theme. Unfortunately we cannot be sure about the argument. Ipu-wer is certainly describing the ideal ruler. The alternatives are (a) that this ruler is a pattern from the past, perhaps the sun-god Re, or (b) that the passage is truly messianic and that Ipu-wer is looking forward to the god-king who will deliver Egypt from her woes. This translation takes the latter alternative. 37 The ideal king should know the perennial nature of man. Gram

matically, the sentence is not an unreal condition, "Would that he had perceived," referring to Re's punishment of mankind (pp. I O - I I above), but a condition of wish, probably referring to the future. 38 In an unintelligible section, here omitted, Ipu-wer uses the second person singular. As Nathan said to David: "Thou art the man," so Ipu-wer must finally be addressing the pharaoh. pinning the responsibility for Egypt's woes directly on the king, as indicated in the following context. 39 Hu "authoritative utterance" or "creative command," and Sia "intellectual perception" or "cognition," were a pair of related attributes, often deified. As attributes of kingship, they were sometimes linked to ma'at "justice" or "truth." Kingship thus needed the ability to comprehend a situation, the authority to meet the situation by command, and the balance of equitable justice. 40 The slain people belong to the herd of pharaoh, the herdsman. 41 It is impossible to understand the statement which Ipu-wer attributes to the pharaoh as an excuse for weakness. Perhaps he is saying that there is more than one side to a question. 42 In milder form, this might be translated: "Lies are told thee." 43 In combatting the pharaoh's obscure argument, Ipu-wer again recites some of the anarchy in Egypt. Seemingly he states that personal experience in such troubles would make the king talk differently. 44 A series of stanzas now begins with the formula: "It is still, however, good," introducing a nostalgic recollection of former days, which would still be happy in the future. 45 The Madjoi, people from lands south of Egypt, were used as police in Egypt.

The Middle Kingdom delivered Egypt from the civil war and anarchy which had followed the Old Kingdom. These troubles and their ultimate resolution produced a sense of messianic salvation, a feeling which the early pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom probably fostered in their own interests. The following text was apparendy composed at that time of happy deliverance, although the earliest extant copies happen to date from the Eighteenth Dynasty, about five centuries later. The text purports to relate how King Snefru of the Fourth Dynasty sought entertainment and how a prophet foretold the downfall of the Old Kingdom and the reestablishment of order by Amen-emhet I, the first king of the Twelfth Dynasty. Papyrus Leningrad 1116B was published by W. Golenischeff, Les papyrus hiSratiques no. ///5, 1116A, et 1116B de I'Ermitage Imperial & St. Pitersbourg (St. Petersburg, 1913). T h e text was studied and translated by A. H. Gardiner in JEA, 1 (1914), 100-06, and translated by Erman, LAE, n 0-15. T h e text was used for school purposes in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties and portions appear on two ostraca and two writing tablets.·
Now IT HAPPENED THAT the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Snefru, the triumphant, was the beneficent king in this entire land. On one of these days it happened that the official council of the Residence City entered into the Great House—life, [prosperity], health!—to offer greeting. Then they went out, that they might offer greetings (elsewhere), according to their daily procedure. Then his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—said to the seal-bearer who was at his side: "Go and bring me (back) the official council of the Residence City, which has gone forth hence to offer greetings on this [day]." (Thereupon they) were ushered in to him (5) immediately. Then they were
48 It would seem that Egypt's own troops were disloyal. 47 Since the following words contain an "answer" of Ipu-wer, this paragraph, much of which is omitted as unintelligible; contains the pharaoh's disturbed comment, trying to assay Egypt's strength. 48 "His salvation" means death. The formula at the beginning of this paragraph is the storytelling formula, "There was a man, who was," and we certainly have the beginning of a narrative here. Either it is told by Ipu-wer as a parable, or it does not belong to the Admonitions of Ipu-wer, which would then end on- the ominous note of "fear of the morrow." 49 The story defies consecutive translation. It apparently deals with violence to the tomb and to the corpses and funerary furniture. The last two columns of the papyrus are in lamentable destruction.
1 This translation retains the now traditional name of Nefer-rohu for the Egyptian prophet, even though G. Posener in Revue d'tgyptologie, vni ( 1 9 5 1 ) , 1 7 1 - 7 4 , has produced evidence making it highly probable that the man's name is to be read Neferti—cf. the reference to a sage of that name in the text translated on p. 432.
on their bellies in the presence of his majesty a second time. Then his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—said to them: " ( M y ) people, behold, I have caused you to be called to have you seek out for me a son of yours who is wise, or a brother of yours who is competent, or a friend of yours who has performed a good deed, one who may say to me a few fine words or choice speeches, at the hearing of which my [majesty] may be entertained." Then they put (themselves) upon their bellies in the presence of his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—once more. T H E N THEY SAID BEFORE his majesty—life, prosperity, health!: "A great lector-priest of Bastet,2 O sovereign, our lord, (10) whose name is Nefer-rohu—he is a commoner valiant [with] his arm, a scribe competent with his fingers; he is a man of rank, who has more property than any peer of his. Would that he [might be permitted] to see his majesty!" Then his majestylife, prosperity, health!—said: " G o and [bring] him to me!" Then he was ushered in to him immediately. Then he was on his belly in the presence of his majestylife, prosperity, health! Then his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—said: "Come, pray, Nefer-rohu, my friend, that thou mayest say to me a few fine words or choice speeches, at the hearing of which my majesty may be entertained!" Then the lector-priest Nefer-rohu said: "Of what has (already) happened or of what is going to happen, O Sovereign—life, prosperity, health! —[my] lord?" ( 1 5 ) Then his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—said: "Rather of what is going to happen. If it has taken place by today, pass it [£y]."8 Then he stretched forth his hand for the box of writing equipment; then he drew forth a scroll of papyrus and a palette; thereupon he put (it) into writing.4 What the lector-[priest] Nefer-rohu said, that wise man of the east, he who belonged to Bastet at her appearances, that child of the Heliopolitan nome,5 AS HE BROODED over what (was to) happen in the land, as he called to mind the state of the east, when the Asiatics would move about with their strong arms, would disturb the hearts [of] those who are at the harvest, and would take away the spans of cattle at the plowing. (20) He said: Bestir thyself, O my heart, as thou bewailest this land in which thou didst begin! To be silent is repression. Behold, there is something about which men sneak as terrifying, for, behold, the great man is a thing passed away (in the land) where thou didst begin. BE
2 The lector-priest (literally, "he who carries the ritual") was initiated into the sacred writings and thus was priest, seer, and magician. Bastet was the cat-goddess of Bubastis in the eastern half of the Delta. 8 This must be the general sense, although the wording is obscure. An Egyptian interest in the future, rather than the past, was not normal, but a prophecy which promised that the future would restore the past would be acceptable. 4 The pharaoh himself wrote down the prophecy. The Egyptian texts treat Snefru as a friendly and approachable ruler; see B. Gunn in JEA, xn (1926), 250-51. Here, instead of calling upon a scribe, he does his own writing; he addresses his courtiers as "my people" and Nefer-rohu as "my friend." 5 Although now serving in Bubastis, he had been born in the Heliopolitan nome.

THE DIVINE NOMINATION
OF THUT-MOSE III
Although the pharaoh Thut-mose III became the great conqueror and empire builder, his origins seem to have been comparatively humble. He was one of the sons of a pharaoh, but his mother was probably not of the royal line. Powerful forcesperhaps the priesthood of Amon of Karnak, to whom he always was particularly generous—made him their choice for the throne when he was a young and modest priest. This was stated as being the oracular choice of the god himself. In the later years of Thut-mose's reign, he gave the following account of his miraculous nomination to the kingship and his indebtedness to the god Amon. The inscription is carved on the walls of the Temple of Amon at Karnak. T h e text was published by K. Sethe, Ur\unden der 18. Dynastic (Ur\., iv, Leipzig, 1905), 11, 155-76, with antecedent bibliography. In a companion volume (Leipzig, 1914), Sethe gave a translation into German. The significance of the text was brought out by J. H. Breasted, A New Chapter in the Life of Thutmose 111 (Untersuch., 11, ii, Leipzig, 1900). Translation by Breasted, AR, 11, §§131-66. Sethe guesses at a date in Thut-mose's 42nd year (close to 1450 B.C.). T h e beginning of the inscription is lost, but the pharaoh seems to be acquainting his court with the basis of his divine tide to rule.

from the (very) middle of [his] heart [and chose me for the kingship... There is no lie], there is no equivocation therein—when my majesty was (only) a puppy, when I was (only a newly) weaned child who was in his temple, before my installation as prophet had taken place.1... While I was in the guise and role of the "Pillar-ofHis-Mother" priest, like the youth of Horus in Khemmis,2 and I was standing in the north colonnaded hall,8 [Amon-Re came forth from] the glory of his horizon.4 He made heaven and earth festive with his beauty, and he began a great marvel, with his rays in the eyes of men like the rising of Har-akhti. The people gave him (5) [praise, when he halted at the . . . ] of his temple. Then his majesty8 offered him incense upon the flame and presented to him a great oblation of oxen, cattle, and wild beasts of the desert... [The procession j made the circuit of the colonnaded hall on its two sides, but (it) was not in the heart of those who were present to his actions,6 in seeking out my majesty everywhere. (Then he)7 really recognized me, and he halted .. . [/ touched] the ground; I bowed myself down in his presence. He set me before his majesty, I being posted at the Station [of] the Lord.8 Then he worked a marvel over me.9 . . . [These things really happened, without] equivocation, though they were remote from the faces of mankind and mysterious in the hearts of the g o d s . . . There is no one who knows them; there is no one who can judge them .. . [He opened for] me the doors of heaven; he spread open for me the portals of its horizon.101 flew up to the sky as a divine falcon, that I might see his mysterious form which is in heaven, that I might adore his majesty. (10) . . . I saw the forms of being of the Horizon God on his mysterious ways in heaven. Re himself established me, and I was endowed with [his] crowns [which] were upon his head, his uraeusserpent was fixed upon [my b r o w ] . . . I [was equipped] with all his states of glory; I was made satisfied with the understanding of the gods, like Horus when he took account of himselP1 at the house of his father Amon-Re. I was [perfected] with the dignities of a god . . . [He established] my crowns, and drew up for me my titulary himself.12
1 The rank of the hem-netjer "servant of the g o d , " conventionally translated as "prophet," was that of a high temple officiant. 2 The priestly role, "Pillar-of-His-Mother," goes back to the myth of Horus and his mother Isis in the Delta swamps of Khemmis, the mythical birthplace of Horus. • T h i s should have been located between the 4th and 5th pylons of the Temple of Amon at Karnak. 4 The image of the god was carried out of his shrine. 8 The then reigning king, Thut-mose I or II. 6 Those who witnessed the movements of the god's portable shrine could not understand why he was circling the hall. 7 The omission of the pronoun is troublesome, but the sense demands its restoration. 8 The place where the king stood in the temple, cf. pp. 248, 375. 9 Or: "Then he marvelled over me." 10 Poetical terms are used for the entry of the king-designate into the holy of holies of the temple. 11 "Counted his body," in the sense of recognizing his mature powers, after Horus had been awarded the kingship by Re. 12 Sethe points out that the fivefold titulary which follows has a form which characterizes the latter part of Thut-mose's reign (after his 30th year), which would set a terminus a quo for this inscription.

THE DIVINE NOMINATION
OF AN ETHIOPIAN KING
The diffusion and persistence of custom are shown by the following inscription, which is to be dated shortly after 600 B.C. and comes from the Ethiopian kingdom which had its capital at Napata near the Fourth Cataract. Despite differences in time and distance, the essential situation is the same as in the nomination of Thut-mose III: it is the god of Karnak, Amon-Re, here resident at Napata, who makes the choice. The situation conforms generally to the account of the selection of Ethiopian kings as given by Diodorus (111, 5,1). Stela 939 in the Cairo Museum was found at Gebel Barkal near the Fourth Cataract. The text is published in H. Schäfer, Urkunden der älteren Aethiopienkönige (Urk·, ш, Leipzig, 1905), 81-100. All the royal names in the inscription have been hacked out and are here supplied with probability but not with certainty.
Year i, 2nd month of the second season, day 15,1 under the majesty of the Horus: Beautiful of Appearances; the T w o Goddesses: Beautiful of Appearances; the Horus of Gold: Mighty of Heart; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands: [Merka-Re]; the Son of Re, Lord of Diadems: [Aspalta], beloved of Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands, Resident in the Pure Mountain.2 Now the entire army of his majesty was in the town named Pure Mountain, in which Dedwen, Who Presides over Nubia, is the god—he is (also) the god of Cush8after the death of the Falcon upon his throne.4 Now then, the trusted commanders from the midst of the army of his majesty were six men, while the trusted commanders and overseers of fortresses were six men. Now then, the trusted chief secretaries were six men, while the officials and chief treasurers of the palace were seven men.5 Then they said to the entire army: "Come, let us cause (5) our lord to appear, (for we are) like a herd which has no herdsman!" Thereupon this army was very greatly concerned, saying: "Our lord is here with us, (but) we do not know him! Would that we might know him, that we might enter in under him and work for him, as the T w o Lands work for Horus, the son of Isis, after he sits upon the throne of his
the Theban district The inscription continues with a detailed statement of Thut-mose's good works, of which only the passage about foreign captives is here translated.
1 Or "day 1 3 . " Around 600 B.C., this date would fall early in July. 2 "Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands" was the title of Amon-Re at Karnak in Egypt. "The Pure Mountain" was Gebel Barkal, dominating the town of Napata. Here Amon-Re was an honored and effective guest god. 3 Ethiopia. It is interesting that Dedwen does not effect the oracular nomination, but Amon-Re does, just as he did in Egypt. 4 The previous Ethiopian king, G. A. Reisner, in IE A, ix (1923), 75, gives Inle-Amon (Anlaman) as the predecessor of Aspalta. 5 Sic, but read probably "six men," as the nominating college would presumably have equal numbers from the various branches of the government

father Osiris!6 Let us give praise to his two crowns." . . . (10) .. J
Then the army of his majesty all said with one voice: "Still there is this god Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands, Resident in the Pure Mountain. He is (also) a god of Cush. Come, let us go to him. We cannot do a thing without him; nothing is good which is done without him, (but) a good fortune (comes) from the god. He is the god of the kings of Cush since the time of Re. It is he who will guide us. In his hands is the kingship of Cush, which he has given to the son whom he loves " So the commanders of his majesty (15) and the courtiers of the palace went to the Temple of Amon. They found the prophets and the major priests waiting outside the temple. They said to them: "Pray, may this god, Amon-Re, Resident in the Pure Mountain, come, to permit that he give us our lord, to revive us, to build the temples of all the gods and goddesses [of] Upper and Lower Egypt,8 and to present their divine offerings! We cannot do a thing without this god. It is he who guides us." Then the prophets and the major priests entered into the temple, that they might perform every rite of his purification and his censing. Then the commanders of his majesty and the officials of the palace entered into the temple and put themselves upon their bellies before this god. They said: " W e have come to thee, O Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the T w o Lands, F ssident in the Pure Mountain, that thou might give (to) us a lord, to revive us, to build the temples of the gods of Upper and Lower Egypt, and to present divine offerings. That beneficent office is in thy hands—mayest thou give it to thy son whom thou lovest!"
Then they offered9 the King's Brothers before this god, (but) he did not take one of them. For a second time there was offered the King's Brother, Son of Amon, and Child of Mut, Lady of Heaven, the Son of Re: [Aspalta], living forever. Then this god, Amon-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, said: "He is your king. It is he who will revive you. It is he who will build every temple of Upper and Lower Egypt. It is he who will present their divine offerings. His father was my son, the Son of Re: [Inle-Amon], the triumphant. His mother is the King's Sister, King's Mother, Mistress of Cush, (20) and Daughter of Re: [Nenselsa], living forever.10... He is your lord."
6 Ethiopia adhered scrupulously to the hallowed tradition of Egypt, where the dead king was an Osiris and the new king a Horus. Ethiopia even had two crowns to correspond to the two parts of the land of Egypt. 7 Four different members of the nominating college next voice opinions, but without a satisfactory solution. 8 An unconscious or a propagandistically deliberate extension of the power of the Ethiopian king to Egypt proper. 9 "Laid." 10 At the top of the stela a scene shows this queen mother pleading with "Amon of Napata" for the nomination of her son [Aspalta]. Here her epithet "living forever"—not "the triumphant"—shows that she is still alive. In the main inscription there follow the names of six maternal ancestors of [Nenselsa].
PROPHECIES
(The Ethiopian officials accept this nomination gratefully. Aspalta enters into the presence of Amon, receives the crown and sceptre, asks for divine guidance, and receives the god's assurances.)
A DIVINE ORACLE THROUGH
VISIBLE SIGN
The gods of Egypt gave visible indications to answer questions which were put to them at appropriate times and in appropriate ways. Examples of the divine nomination of rulers are given on pp. 446-448. A case of simpler nature is given below, in which the deified pharaoh Neb-pehti-Re (Ah-mose I), who was being carried in procession by priests, halted to give answer to questions submitted to him. In the presence of witnesses, the god accepted one of two alternatives laid before him with regard to the ownership of a certain field. The scene above the inscription shows the ceremonial barque of "the good god, the Lord of the T w o Lands: Neb-pehti-Re Ah-mose," carried on the shoulders of four pairs of priests and attended by the "Prophet Pa-iry, the triumphant." Facing this barque in an attitude of worship or appeal is the "Priest of Osiris, Pa-ser." The inscription is dated in the fourteenth year of Ramses II (about 1287 B.C.). Ah-mose I, who had reigned about 15701545 B.C., presumably had a mortuary chapel at Abydos, where he was worshiped as a god and from which he might emerge in procession. The stela was found at Abydos and is in the Cairo Museum (Journal d'entrie No. 43649). It was published by G. Legrain in ASAE, xvi (1916), 161-70, with a photographic plate.

The Priest Pa-ser appealed: " A s for this field, it belongs to Pai, the son of Sedjemenef,8 and (to) the children of Hayu." And the god remained still.4 [Then he] appealed to the god with the words: "It belongs to the Priest Pa-ser, son of Mose." [Then] the god nodded very much,8 in the presence of the priests of [the good god] Nebpehti-Re: the Prophet Pa-iry, the Priest of the Front Yanzab, the Priest [of the Front] Tja-nofer, the Priest of the Rear Nakht, and the Priest of the Rear Thutmose.® Done by the Outline Draftsman of the House-ofRamses-Meri-Amon-in-the-House-of-Osiris, Neb-mehit7
1 About 1287, this date would fall close to the beginning of September. 2 Here and below, literally "approach (with a petition)."
s I t is possible to read " m y son Sedjemenef," but the translation given is equally possible, and it seems less likely that Pa-ser would be disputing the possession of a field with his own son. * The portable image of the god in his shrouded shrine gave no visible response to the first alternative. In other oracular texts, a word is used for a visible negative response, probably to be translated "recoil," that is, to lean backward. 5 That is, leaned forward repeatedly or very markedly. 6 The five witnesses to the oracle, which established legal ownership of the field in question, were the "prophet" (a conventional rendering of a priestly title) who attended the portable barque, two priests of the front carrying-poles, and two priests of the rear carrying-poles. 7 The inscription was made by an artist of a temple of Ramses II at Abydos.

A DIVINE ORACLE THROUGH A DREAM
One way in which the gods might make their wishes known was through dreams.1 T h e "Sphinx Stela" relates how the god who was in the Sphinx, Harmakhis, asked Thut-mose I V , before he had ascended the throne, to clear that great image of its encumbering sand. Thut-mose IV reigned about 1421-1413 B.C. T h e present text is a pious restoration from somewhere between the n t h and 7th centuries B.C. T h e general similarity of the inscription to the "Sports Stela" of Amen-hotep II (pp. 244-245 above) shows that it faithfully restores a known psychology of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The stela was discovered between the paws of the Sphinx and still stands there. T h e text was presented in C. R. Lepsius, Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien (Berlin, 1849-59), 111, 68. Its best publication was by A. Erman, Die Sphinxstele (SPAW, 1904,428-44). Translated by Breasted, AR, 11, §§810-15.

The villages of Memphis and of every town which is beside it come to it, with their arms (outstretched) in praise before it, bearing great oblations to its \a.
One of these days it happened that the King's Son Thut-mose8 came on an excursion at noon time. Then he rested in the shadow of this great god. Sleep took hold of him, slumbering at the time when the sun was at (its) peak. He found the majesty of this august god speaking with his own mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: "See me, look at me, my son, Thutmose! I am thy father, Harmakhis-Khepri-Re-Atum. I shall give thee my kingdom (10) upon earth at the head of the living. Thou shalt wear the southern crown and the northern crown on the throne of Geb, the crown prince (of the gods).

When he awoke Ishtar showed him a night vision. He reported to me as follows: "Ishtar who dwells in Arbela came in. Right and left quivers were hanging from her. She held the bow in her hand (55) (and) a sharp sword was drawn to do battle. You were standing in front of her and she spoke to you like the mother who bore you.

V I I . Lamentations






A Sumerian Lamentation
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Lamentation over the
Destruction of Ur
The composition bewails the destruction of Ur at the hands of the Elamites and Subarians.1 It consists of 436 lines divided into 11 "songs"2 or stanzas of uneven length; they are separated from one another by an "antiphon"8 of one or two lines. T h e text has been reconstructed from 22 tablets and fragments; except for one tablet which probably comes from Ur,4 they were all excavated at Nippur. T h e tablets on which the poem is inscribed all date from the Early Post-Sumerian period, that is, the period between the fall of the Third Dynasty of Ur and the beginning of Kassite rule in Babylonia: roughly speaking therefore, sometime in the first half of the second millennium B.C. Its actual composition, too, must of course postdate the fall of Ur III; just how long after, however, it is impossible to say.5 A scientific edition of the poem including a transliteration, translation, and commentary, as well as a complete list of variants, will be found in AS 12 (1940). One of the most significant discussions of the text is that of Jacobsen in AJSL, L v n i (1941), 219-224;6 Jacobsen has also translated several passages from the poem in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man (1946), where Mrs. H. A. G. Frankfort is responsible for the poetical renderings.7 A new translation of the entire composition based on the text as reconstructed in AS 12, has been published by M. Witzel in Orientcdia N S , xiv (1945), 185-234 and ibid., xv (1946), 46-63.
8He has abandoned hi[s] stable, his sheepfold {has been delivered) to9 the wind;
1c£. Jacobsen, AJSL, L V I I I ( 1 9 4 1 ) , 220, N.4. 2 The word "song" or "stanza" is an approximate rendering for a Sumerian complex whose more exact meaning is still uncertain. 3 The word "antiphon" is an approximate rendering of a Sumerian complex whose more exact meaning is still uncertain. 4cf. AS 12, 77, n-7i6a; and ibid., 96, n.8ooa. 'Jacobsen, loc. ctu, 2 1 9 - 2 2 1 , comes to the very definite conclusion that the lamentation was written no more than seventy or eighty years after the destruction, but, unless I am very much mistaken, he has considerably oversimplified the problems involved. 6 Especially valuable is the last paragraph entitled "Details," where he makes some excellent suggestions for the translation of a number of passages. 7cf. pp. 1 4 1 - 1 4 2 for lines 1 7 3 - 1 8 9 , 203-204, and 208-218 of the lamentation, and pp. 196-197 for lines 1 5 2 - 1 6 4 . 8 The first song begins with the line " H e has abandoned his stable, his sheepfold (has been delivered) to the wind," and repeats the second- half of this line as a sort of refrain in each of the remaining lines which list the more important temples of Sumer together with the deities w h o have abandoned them. This list runs as follows: Enlil has abandoned Nippur, while his wife Ninlil has abandoned the Kiur, a part of great Ekur temple in Nippur; the mother-goddess Ninmah has abandoned Kesh; the goddess Ninisinna, "the lady of Isin," has abandoned the shrine Egalmah in Isin; Inanna has abandoned Erech; Nanna, the moon-god, has abandoned Ur and its temple Ekishnugal, while his wife Ningal has abandoned her shrine the Enunkug; Enki, the water-god and god of wisdom, has abandoned Eridu; the goddess NLn . . . has abandoned Larak; Shara, the tutelary deity of Umma, has abandoned his temple the £mah, while his wife Usaharra has abandoned Umma; the remaining deities and place names all belong to the city of Lagash and its environs, thus: Bau, the wife of Ningirsu, the tutelary deity of Lagash has abandoned the city Urukug and the temple Bagara, while her son Abbau has abandoned the shrine Maguenna; "Hie lamassu, a protecting genie, has abandoned the temple Etarsirsir; the mother of Lagash, Gatumdug, has abandoned Lagash; Ningula of Nina has abandoned Sirara; Dumuziabzu, " T a m m u z of the Apsu," has abandoned Kinirshag; the goddess Ninmar has abandoned the shrine Guabba. For some reason as yet uncertain, the first " s o n g " is written not in the main Sumerian

dialect but in the Emesal dialect, which is usually reserved for speeches by female deities or recitations by certain classes of priests. • T h e words "has been delivered to" in this and the following lines should have been treated as uncertain in the translation in AS 12 because of the grammatical uncertainty in the preceding Sumerian complexes. 10 The Sumerian word rendered "the lady" in AS 12 should have been translated "she who is." 11 In AS 12 the name of this city is written throughout as Uruk; however in my following publications I have used the biblical form Erech, and for the sake of consistency this form will be used in the present translation. 12 For the reading Ekishnugal instead of Ekishshirgal, cf. Shuster, ZA, XLRV ( 1 9 3 8 ) , 263, n.io, and particularly the phonetic writing of the name in Gadd and Legrain, VET, 1, No. 169, line 9, where it is written as Ekeshnu(n)s;al. 18 " T h e wild o x " should not have been rendered as uncertain in AS 12.

Thy lament which is bitter—-O city, set up thy lament; His Ur which has been destroyed—bitter is its lament. Thy lament which is bitter—how long will it grieve thy weeping lord ?
14 The names Bau and Abbau are also read Baba and Abbaba, but probably the two readings represent slighdy variant pronunciations of the same word. 15 "House" instead of "temple" in AS 12. 16 For the reading Etarsirsir, cf. Nougayrol, JCS, 1 ( 1 9 4 7 ) , 3 3 2 , n.18. 17 In AS 12 this name was read in its Emesal form Masisib; this was inconsistent since all the other names were read as they appear in the main dialect, and not in the Emesal. 18 "She who is" instead of "the lady" in AS 12. 19 Like the first "song," the second too is written in the Emesal dialect (cf. end of n.8). Beginning with a cry directed to Ur to "set up a bitter lament," the first part of the "song" continues with several variations on the theme of Ur and her lament. The cry to "set up a bitter lament" is then directed to other centers of Sumer, namely to Nippur and its main temple, the Ekur, as well as the shrines Magishshua, Ubshukinnakku, and perhaps Kiur; to Lagash, particularly its district Urukug, the temple Etarsirsir, and the shrine Maguenna; to Isin and its temple Egalmah; to Erech and Eridu. Toward the end of the "song" however, it returns once more to Ur and in words spoken direcdy to the city, bewails its destruction, the loss of its people, and die transformation of its ordinances into inimical ordinances.

Thy lament which is bitter—how long will it grieve the weeping Nanna ? O thou city of name, thou hast been destroyed;82 O thou city of high walls, thy land has perished. O my city, like an innocent ewe thy lamb has been torn away from thee; O Ur, like an innocent goat thy kid has perished. O city thy rites unto inimical dread and awe?*
Thy ordinances24—unto inimical ordinances, have been transformed. (70) Thy lament which is bitter—how long will it grieve thy weeping lord ? Thy lament which is bitter—how long will it grieve the weeping Nanna ? The second song.
20 For one meaning of the word J(igd (J^igdlu is the Akkadian loan w o r d ) , cf. PAPS, L X X X V ( 1 9 4 2 ) , 3 1 2 ; its meaning when used alongside of the Kiur is uncertain. 21 Lines 48-62 have quite a different arrangement in one of the texts; cf. AS 12, p. 22, n.4ia. 22 For another possible rendering of this and the following line, cf. Jacobsen, loc. cit., p. 2 2 3 . 28 Note the new rendering of this difficult line; it is based on the assumption that it parallels the first part of line 70. Actually the last part of the line might have been expected "unto inimical rites" rather than "unto inimical dread and awe"; perhaps "dread and awe" are intended as a descriptive substitute for "rites." 24 The word "ordinances" attempts to render the Sumerian word me which designates a theological concept developed by the Sumerian thinkers to answer the problem as to what keeps the cosmic entities and phenomena, once created, operating continuously and harmoniously, without conflict and confusion. To judge from the various contexts, the word me seems to denote a set of rules and regulations assigned to each cosmic deity and phenomenon for the purpose of keeping it operating forever in accordance with the plans laid down by the creating deities.

His [righteous city] which has been destroyed—bitter is its lament; His Ur which has been destroyed—bitter is its lament; Its antiphon. Together with the lord, whose house has been attacked, his city was given over to tears;25 Together with Nanna, whose land had perished, Ur joined (its) lament. The righteous woman,26 because of his city to grieve the lord, (80) Ningal, because of his \land\ to give no rest to [the lord)
Unto h[im] for the sake of his city approached—bitterly she weeps, Unto the lord for the sake of his house which had been attacked approached—bitterly she weeps;
[Far the sa\e} of his [city which had been attached] she approached him—bitterly she weeps. [For the sa\e~\ of his [house\ which had been attacked she approached him—its bitter lament she sets before him. The woman, after h e r . . . had set the lamentation down upon the ground ,2T Herself utters softly the wail of the smitten house.
"The storm ever breaking forth—its wail has filled me full.28 Raging about because of the storm, Me, a woman, the storm ever breaking forth—its wail has filled me full. (90) The storm ever breaking forth—its wail has filled me full. During the day a bitter storm having been raised unto me, I, although, for that day I tremble, Fled not before that day's violence.
Because of its affliction I sa v not one good day during my rule, one good day during my rule. At night a bitter lament having been raised unto me>
25 The third "song" informs us that Ningal, the wife of the moon-god Nanna, moved by Ur's bitter plight, approached her husband and, determined to give him no rest and to arouse him to the fate of her city and house, wept bitterly before him: Day and night she is pursued by the wailing and lamenting resulting from a destructive storm; not even in her sleeping place is there any peace and rest. To be sure, she makes numerous attempts to halt the suffering and destruction of her city and land, but she fails to save Ur from its cruel fate. T h e Ekishnugal has caved in like a garden hut; it is exposed to wind and rain like a tent. Her house and city have been torn down like a sheepfold; her possessions are dissipated. As for the renderings of lines 7 7 - 7 9 , the modifications follow Jacobsen, loc. cit., 221, n . n , where most of the points are well taken. 26 "Woman" instead of " l a d y " in AS 12. 27 Note the new, though still doubtful, translations for lines 86-7; they are based primarily on Jacobsen's suggestions (loc. cit., 223, n . 1 8 ) ; cf. also Witzel's excellent suggestion that the third sign in line 86 is AD (Orientatia NS, xv [ 1 9 4 6 ] , 4 7 ) its meaning in our line, however, remains uncertain. 28 For lines 8 8 - 1 1 2 , cf. the excellent rendering by Jacobsen-Frankfort in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, pp. 1 9 6 - 1 9 7 ; much of its effectiveness is due to a not overly literal approach in the translation of the Sumerian words and phrases and to a flexible treatment of the Sumerian line order. However, for our present purpose, and under present conditionsnot a few of the renderings in the Jacobsen-Frankfort translation of this passage are far from assured—it is advisable to follow the more literal translations in AS 12. Note, however, the modifications in the translations of lines 94, 98, 99, 100, 1 0 2 , 1 0 3 , 104, and 109; some of these were suggested by the renderings in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man; others are due to several excellent suggestions made by Witzel, loc. cit., pp. 48-49, to lines 99, 102, 1 0 3 , and 108.
I, although, for that night I tremble, Fled not before that night's violence. The storm's cyclonelike destruction—verily its terror has filled me full. Because of its [affliction] in my nightly sleeping place, in my nightly sleeping place verily there is no peace for me; (100) Nor, verily, because of its affliction, has the quiet of my sleeping place, the quiet of my sleeping place been allowed me. Although, because in my land there was bitter [distress], I, like a cow for (its) calf, trudge the earth, My land was not delivered of fear.
Although, because in my city there was bitter [distress], I, like a bird of heaven, flap (my) wings, (And) to my city I fly, My city on its foundation verily was destroyed; Ur where it lay verily perishes.
Although because the hand of the storm appeared above, (no) I screamed and cried to it, 'Return, O storm, to the plain,' The storm's breast verily rose not to depart, Me, the woman,26 in the Enunkug, my house of ladyship, For whose rule long days had not been granted me, Verily weeping and lamentation follow. As for the house which used to be the place where was soothed the spirit of the black-headed people, Instead of its feasts wrath (and) distress verily multiply.29 Because of its affliction, in my house, the favorable place,80 My attacked righteous house upon which no eye had been cast, With heavy spirit, laments that are bitter, (120) Laments that are bitter, have been brought. My house founded by the righteous,81 Like a garden hut, verily on its side has caved in. The Ekishnugal, my royal house, The righteous house, my house which has been given over to tears, Whose building, falsely, whose perishing, truly, Had been set for me as its lot and share,82 Like a tent, the house where the crops have been . . . , Like the house where the crops have been .. . , to wind
and rain verily has been exposed.
Ur, my all-surpassing chamber** (130)
My smitten house {and) city which have been torn down,
Like the sheepfold of a shepherd verily has been torn down; My possessions which had accumulated in the city verily have been dissipated."
29 Note the modified rendering of this line; cf. Witzel's comment to he-en-ga, loc. cit., p. 50; Witzel also suggests a variant rendering of this line which is well worth noting. 80 Note the modifications in the renderings of lines 1 1 8 - 1 2 1 : cf., too, Witzel, loc. cit., p. 50. The implications of the phrase "upon which no eye had been cast," are uncertain. 31 "The righteous" instead of "a righteous man" in AS 12. 82 " H a d " and "set" for "has" and "established" in AS 12. 88 "All-surpassing" instead of "extra large" in AS 1 2 ; note, too, Witzel's suggestion to the line in loc. cit., p. 50.

The third song. Ur has been given over to tears; Its antiphon.
"On that day, after the lord had been overcome by the storm,84
After, in spite of the'lady ,' her city had been destroyed; On that day, after the lord had been overwhelmed by the storm,
After they had pronouncedra5 the utter destruction of my city ; (140) After they had pronounced the utter destruction of Ur, After they had directed86 that its people be killedOn that day verily I abandoned not my city; My land verily I forsake not To Anu the water of my eye verily I poured; To Enlil I in person verily made supplication. 'Let not my city be destroyed,' verily I said unto them; 'Let not Ur be destroyed,' verily I said unto them; 'Let not its people perish,' verily I said unto them. Verily Anu changed not87 this word; (150) Verily Enlil with its 'It is good; so be it' soothed not my heart. For the second time, when the council had . . . ed88 (And) the Anunnaki... had seated themselves, The legs verily I . . . ed, the arms verily I stretched out, To Anu the water of my eye verily I poured; To Enlil I in person verily made supplication. 'Let not my city be destroyed,' verily I said unto them; 'Let not Ur be destroyed,' verily I said unto them; 'Let not its people perish,' verily I said unto them. Verily Anu changed not this work; (160) Verily Enlil with its 'It is good; so be it' soothed not my heart. The utter destruction of my city verily they directed, The utter destruction of Ur verily they directed; That its people be killed, as its fate verily they decreed. Me like one who has given them my Me of my city verily they deprived;89 My Ur of me verily they deprived. Anu changes not his command; Enlil alters not the command which he had issued." The fourth song. (170) Her city has been destroyed; her ordinances have become inimical; Its antiphon.
84 In the fourth "song" Ningal continues her lament before Nanna, describing her efforts in behalf of her city and bemoaning their futility: It was Anu and Enlil who had ordered Ur to be destroyed and its people to be killed. And when she, Ningal, wept before them and pleaded that Ur should not be destroyed and that its people should not perish, they denied her plea. Anu and Enlil have ordered the destruction of Ur and the death of its people, and they are not wont to change their commands. 85 "Pronounced" in this and the following line instead of "commanded" in AS 1 2 . 8e "Directed" in this line and in lines 162-163 instead of "ordered" in AS 1 2 .
87 "Changed not" for "turned not to"; cf. Witzel's constructive comment in loc. cit., p. 5 1 .
88 For lines 1 5 2 - 1 6 4 , cf. Jacobsen, JNES, n ( 1 9 4 3 ) , 1 7 2 , and JacobsenFrankfort, The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, p. 1 9 7 ; the suggestions there made for the rendering of the words and phrases here left untranslated in the first three lines of this passage do not seem to me to hit the mark. 89 The new renderings of this line and the next follow Witzel's suggestion, loc. cit., p. 52.
Enlil called the storm;40 the people groan.41 The storm of overflow he carried off from the land; the people groan. The good storm he carried off from Sumer; the people groan. To the evil storm he issued directions;42 the people groan. To Kingaluda, the tender of the storm, he entrusted it.48 The44 storm that annihilates the land he called; the people groan. The evil winds he called; the people groan. Enlil brings Gibil to his aid.45 (180) The great storm of heaven he called; the people groan. The great storm howls above; the people groan. The land-annihilating storm roars below; the people groan. The evil wind, like the rushing torrent, cannot be restrained; The boats of the city it attacks (and) devours,46 At the base of heaven it made the ... whirl; the people groan. In front of the storm fires burned ;47 the people groan. To the battling storms was joined the scorching heat;48 . . . fires burned.49 The day was deprived of the rising of the bright sun, of the good light,50 (190) In the land the bright sun rose not, like the evening star it shone.
The night was deprived by the South Wind of its customary feasts and banquets;
40 In the fifth "song" which is written entirely in the main Sumerian dialect, the poet describes in detail an overwhelming affliction which overtook Ur in the form of a devastating storm. Beginning with a statement that after he had carried off from Sumer the "good storm," the "storm of overflow," Enlil called against the land the "evil storm," much of the remainder of the "song" concerns itself with a description of this evil storm and with other destructive elemental forces which aid and abet it 41 There is some possibility that the rendering "groan" should be changed to " m o u r n " ; cf. Jacobsen, loc. cit., p. 223. For lines 1 7 3 - 1 8 9 , cf. now the Jacobsen-Frankfort translation in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, pp. 1 4 1 - 1 4 2 ; it reads excellently indeed, but its renderings are perhaps too free for reference works. Thus e.g. the same Sumerian word is translated as "storm" in one line and " w i n d " in another; the same Sumerian complex is rendered as "disastrous wind" in one line and as "tempest" in another. Moreover, starting with the line " A l l these he gathered at the base of heaven" (the last line on p. 1 4 1 of the book; it corresponds to our line 186) some of the renderings should be treated as doubtful; particularly is it uncertain that the subject of these lines is Enlil. For although it is to be admitted that the assumption that Enlil is the subject gives excellent sense to the passage, the text as it stands hardly justifies it 42 "Issued directions" instead of "gave (his) order" in AS 12. 48 For the rendering of this line cf. Jacobsen's excellent comment in loc. cit., p. 223. Note that the refrain is omitted here since the line is really a continuation of the preceding line. 44 " T h e " in this line and the next and in line 1 8 1 , for "to the" in AS 12. 45 Note the omission of the refrain; perhaps this line is closely connected with the preceding, cf. n.43 (note, too, the period at the end of this line instead of the semicolon in AS 1 2 ) . 46 Lines 185-187 seem to go together (the subject is "the evil wind" in all three lines), hence perhaps the refrain is found only in the last of the three lines; note, too, that the refrain is missing in lines 188-192, perhaps for no better reason in some cases than for lack of space. 47 Note that in this line and those following the present rendering differs from that in AS 12 in not treating "the evil w i n d " (line 1 8 4 ) as the subject of the verbal forms. 48 For the new rendering, cf. particularly Jacobsen, loc. cit., p. 2 2 3 . 49 The first half of the line seems to me too doubtful at present for any fruitful attempt at its translation. 60 Note the new renderings for lines 1 9 0 - 1 9 2 ; cf. Witzel, Orientalia N S , xiv, 209.

At the side of their51 cups dust was piled high; the people groan. Over the black-headed people, the winds swept; the people groan.
Sumer is broken up by the gilburru;52 the people groan. It attacks the land and devours it.58 The afflicting storm by tears is not adjured; The destructive storm makes the land tremble and quake;54 Like the flood storm it destroys the cities. The land-annihilating storm set up (its) ordinance/5 in the city; (200) The all-destroying storm came doing evil;" Like a . . . -storm it placed the . . . upon the people. The storm ordered by Enlil in hate, the storm which wears away the land,87 Covered Ur like a garment, enveloped it like linen. The fifth song. The raging storm has attacked unceasingly; the people groan; Its antiphon. On that day the (good) storm was carried off from the city;58 that city into ruins,59 (210) 0 Father Nanna, that city into ruins was made; the people groan. On that day the (good) storm was carried off from the land; the people groan. Its people, not potsherds, filled its sides;6 Its walls were breached; the people groan. In its lofty gates, where they were wont to promenade, dead bodies were lying about; In its boulevards, where the feasts were celebrated, scattered they lay.*2
In all its streets, where they were wont to promenade, dead bodies were lying about;
51 "Their" refers perhaps to the "black-headed people" in the next line. 52 The gilburru is a weapon used in hunting gazelles; cf. line 220. 53 Note the new rendering of the line. Note, that in this and the following lines, the refrain is omitted. 54 More literally, "makes the land tremble again and again." 55 "Decrees" (here rendered "ordinances") should have been treated as doubtful in AS 1 2 ; cf. Jacobsen, loc. cit., p. 223. 56 "Came doing evil" should have been treated as doubtful in AS 1 2 ; note, too, the slighdy different rendering in the next line. 57 Note the new rendering; cf. particularly Jacobsen, loc. cit., p. 223. 58 The sixth "song" too is written in the main Sumerian dialect. The first three lines speak of a "storm" which had been directed against Ur and Sumer and had turned them into ruins; practically the entire remainder of the "song," however, treats of the calamities that befell Ur as a result of her defeat in battle: T h e walls of Ur were breached, and the dead bodies of its people filled the gates. In their streets and boulevards they were ruthlessly attacked and laid low. Those who had been killed by the enemies' weapons lay unburied and untended; those who escaped were prostrated by the "storm." In Ur weak and strong alike perished through famine. Parents who did not leave their houses were overcome by fire, suckling babes were carried off by the waters. Judgment and counsel perished in the land. Parents abandoned their children, husbands their wives; all their possessions were scattered about. Gone is Ningal, its lady; she has departed like a flying bird. Lofty Ekishnugal is devoured by the axe; the Subarians and the Elamites break it up with the pickaxe and turn it into ruins. Ningal cries "Alas for my city, alas for my house." Ur is destroyed and its people are dispersed.
59 Note that the refrain is only used intermittently throughout this "song." For lines 208-218, cf. the Jacobsen-Frankfort translation in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, p. 1 4 2 .

In its places, where the festivities of the land took place, the people lay in heaps.68 The blood of the land, like bronze and l e a d . . . ; Its dead bodies, like fat placed in the sun,64 of themselves melted away. Its men who were brought to an end by the axe were not covered with head-bandages;6B
Like a gazelle held fast by the gilburru,M (their) mouths bit the dust. (220) Its men who were struck down by the spear were not bandaged;
Lo (as) in the place where their mother labored they lay stricken in their blood.
Its men who were brought to an end by the battle-mace were n o t . . . d; (Although) they were not drinkers of strong drink, they drooped neck over shoulder. Who kept standing67 near the weapons, by the weapons was killed; the people groan.
Who escaped them, by the storm was prostrated;68 the people groan. Ur—its weak and (its) strong perished through hunger; Mothers and fathers who did not leave their houses, were overcome by fire; The young lying on their mothers' laps,69 like fish were carried off by the waters;
Of the nursemaids, pried open were their strong hjrim m u-garments ;T0 (230) The judgment of the land perished; the people groan. The counsel of the land was dissipated; the people groan. The mother left her daughter; the people groan. The father turned away from his son; the people groan. In the city the wife was abandoned, the child was abandoned, the possessions were scattered about;
The black-headed people into their family places71.. . were carried off. Its lady like a flying bird departed from her city; Ningal like a flying bird departed from her city; On all its possessions which had been accumulated in the land, a defiling hand was placed.

The Subarians and the Elamites, the destroyers, made of it thirty shekels.78 The righteous house they break up with the pickaxe; the people groan. The city they make into ruins; the people groan. Its lady cries: "Alas for my city," cries: "Alas for my house"; Ningal cries: "Alas for my city," cries: "Alas for my house. As for me, the woman,74 my city has been destroyed, my house too has been destroyed; O Nanna, Ur has been destroyed, its people have been dispersed." (250) The sixth song. In her stable, in her sheepfold the lady utters bitter words: "The city is being destroyed by the storm"; (252a) Its antiphon. Mother Ningal in her city like an enemy stood aside.75 The woman76 loudly utters the wail for her attacked house; The princess in Ur, her attacked shrine, bitterly cries: "Verily Anu has cursed my city, my city verily has been destroyed; Verily Enlil has turned inimical to my house, by the pickaxe verily it has been torn up. Upon him who comes from below verily he hurled fire—alas my city verily has been destroyed; Enlil upon him who comes from above verily hurled the flame. (260) Outside the city, the outer city77 verily has been destroyed —'alas for my city' I will say. Inside the city, the inner city verily has been destroyed —'alas for my house' I will say.
73 That is, perhaps, treated it with the utmost contempt; note the amount "thirty shekels." 74 " W o m a n " instead of " l a d y " in AS 12. 75 In the first three lines the poet introduces "mother" Ningal on the point of uttering a bitter wail fox the terrible fate that overtook her city and shrine; the contents of this rather long lament are then given in the form of a soliloquy by the embittered goddess (lines 257-298): Anu has cursed her city, and Enlil has turned inimical to her house. The inner city as well as the outer city have been destroyed. In the rivers of Ur the dust has gathered; there is no fresh water. There is no grain in the fields; gone is the field worker. Her palm groves and vineyards have brought forth the mountain thorn. Her possessions have been carried off to the lower lands and the upper lands; her precious metal, stone, and lapis lazuli lie scattered about. Her ornaments of precious metal and stone adorn the bodies of those who " k n o w " not precious metal and stone. Her sons and daughters have been carried off into captivity; she is no longer queen of Ur. Her city and house have been destroyed; a strange city and a strange house have been erected in their place. Woe is her; Ur is destroyed, and its people are dead. Where then shall she sit down, where shall she stand up? Here follows an interruption of the goddess's words in which the poet describes the violence of her lament (lines 299-301); the deity's bitter soliloquy then continues: Woe is her; her house is a stable torn down, her cows are dispersed, the weapon has fallen on her ewes. She has gone forth from the city and found no rest; she has gone forth from the house and found no dwelling place. She is a stranger in a strange city; curses and abuse are heaped upon her. She approached her lord Nanna for the sake of his house and city which have been destroyed and weeps bitterly before him. Woe is her; "O my 'city-fate,'" she will say, "bitter is my 'city-fate.'" "O my house which has been destroyed," she will say, "bitter is my 'house-fate.'" Like a fallen ox she will lie down beside the ruins of her city and her house, and will not rise up. Bitter is the destruction of her house and city attacked without cause. TM " W o m a n " instead of " l a d y " in AS 12. 77 For "outer city" and "inner city," cf.

" "Woman's" for "lady's" in AS 12. 88 Note the new rendering of this line; it follows in part the suggestions made by Jacobsen, loc. cit., p. 224. 89 In the eighth "song," our poet once again addresses the goddess Ningal. Beginning with the words "O queen, m<t\e thy heart like water·, thou, how dost thou livel" and repeating this and parallel phrases as a persistent refrain, the "song" dwells on the misfortunes that have befallen her city and temple, but concludes with words of comfort and consolation. Her city has been destroyed and her house has perished. Her city has become a strange city; her house has become a house of tears and has been given over to the pickaxe. She is no longer queen of her people; these have been led to slaughter. Her city has been made into ruins, her house has been laid bare. Ur, the shrine, has been given over to die wind. Its priests are gone; its rites are no longer performed. The black-headed people celebrate not her (Ningal's) feasts, play no music, pour no libations. Her song has turned to weeping and her music to lamentation. The fat of the ox is not prepared for her, nor the milk of her sheep; the fisherman brings not her fish, nor the bird-hunter her birds. Her rivers and roads are overgrown with weeds. Her city weeps before her; her house cries her "Where, pray?" May she, Ningal, return like an ox to her stable, like a sheep to her fold, like a young child to her chamber. May Anu utter her ahulappu, her " 'tis enough" (of suffering); may Enlil decree her favorable fate, may he return Ur to its place for Ningal to exercise her queenship. 90 "Woman" instead of ' l a d y " in AS 12.

91 The four dots at the end of this line in AS 12, are superfluous. 92 Perhaps the rendering of this line should read: "Without 'tears of supplication' foreigners inhabit it." cf. Witzel, loc. cit., p. 58. 98 In AS 12, p. 59, n . 5 5 1 should read: More literally perhaps: "pressed the hand on the mouth." 94 "Laid bare" instead of "made into a pasture" in AS 12. 95 Note the new rendering of the line; the word following "into the" might be expected to parallel the giparru in line 349 and the gigunA in line 3 5 2 and thus be the name of a part of the temple complex; cf. also JCS, 1 ( 1 9 4 7 ) , 43, n.250. T h e paliiu, the enu (line 3 4 9 ) , and the mahhu (line 352) are important priestly classes in the service of the temple. 96 Note the new rendering of the line. 97 Note the new rendering; it is doubtful if the suggested restoration hi-li in AS 12 is correct. 98 " T h e y " in this and the next line presumably refer to "the black-headed people" of line 357. 99 T h e uppu and the alii are two musical instruments. 1 0 0 Note die different word order in the translation in AS 12. 1 0 1 " T h e " for " t h y " in AS 12.

1 0 4 Note restoration of "a queen" instead of Mother Ningal, and cf. Witzel, Orientalia N S , x v , 59. 1 0 5 T w o variant texts have two lines preceding this line; they read: "May he return Nippur to its place for thee; exercise its queenship! May he return Isin to its place for thee; exercise its queenship!" In these two texts, therefore, Nippur and Isin are treated more or less as equals of Ur. 10a The ninth and tenth "songs" together—from the point of view of their contents there seems to be no reason for the division into two songscontain the poet's plea to Nanna not to permit the "storm" to overwhelm Ur and its inhabitants. Beginning with the statement: "Alas, all the storms together have flooded the land," they continue with a description of the "storms" and their destructive deeds, and conclude with a number of curses against it.

(The storm) which overwhelmed the living creatures of heaven and earth, the black-headed people—(410) May that storm be entirely destroyed!
1 0 7 Note the new renderings of lines 390, and 395-396; they are based on the assumption that the first Sumerian word has the meaning "storm"; cf. also Witzel, Orientalia N S , x i v , 229, 2 3 1 . Note, too, that lines 390, 393-39<>, 398, 400-406, and 4 1 0 , end in a Sumerian sign which may indicate that line 388 is to be repeated after each of them as a refrain. 1 0 8 "Destroyed" instead of "destroy" in AS 12; so quite correcdy Witzel, loc. cit., 229.
1 0 9 Note that line 396 should not be followed by a period; the' description of the storm is continued after lines 3 9 7 - 3 9 9 which, for reasons that are far from obvious, have been interposed here to separate the two "songs." 1 1 0 As Witzel, Orientalia N S , xv, 60, has pointed out, the Sumerian transliteration to this line in AS 12 erroneously read JeJ for dumu. 1 1 1 Note the new renderings to lines 405-406 and cf. the comparable text in lines 202-203; indeed one of the texts has a variant to line 406 whose contents are identical with line 203, that is: " T h e storm ordered by Enlil in hate, the storm which wears away the land."

May the heart of those who dwell in the land be good before thee!117 O Nanna, thy city which has been returned to its place exalts thee. The eleventh song.118
1 1 2 The last "song" contains a prayer addressed by the poet to Nanna to restore Ur and its people to their original and favored position. While the first five lines seem to describe the abjectness and humility of the blackheaded people, the remaining lines contain a plea to Nanna to look steadfastly and kindly upon the prayers, offerings, and "hearts" of the dwellers of Ur. 1 1 8 cf. Jacobsen's excellent suggestion in loc. cit., p. 224. 11 * "Verily" in this and the next line for " m a y " in AS 1 2 . 1 1 5 Note die modified renderings in this and the next line. 1 1 8 For "searches the bowels" cf. Jacobsen's suggestion in loc. cit., p. 224. 1 1 7 For a possible variant rendering, cf. Jacobsen, loc. cit., p. 224. 1 1 8 The colophon of the best preserved tablet contains the statement that it is the work of "the hand of Apil-Sumugan; the month of Tishrfc, the sixteenth day." The line giving the date-formula for the year is destroyed, but there is some reason to believe that it belonged to the reign of Samsuiluna, the son of Hammurabi.

Egyptian Secular Songs and Poems
T R A N S L A T O R : JOHN A. W I L S O N
A Song of the Harper
A common scene in the tombs of ancient Egypt shows a harper entertaining guests at a feast. More than once he calls upon them to surrender themselves to pleasure, because they can have no certainty that earthly diligence will lead to eternal bliss. The present translation is made from Papyrus Harris 500 (now British Museum 10060), recto vi 2-vii 3, a manuscript of about 1300 B.C. A closely similar version was in the Sakkarah tomb of Pa-Aton-em-heb, of the Amarna period (about 13751360 B.C.), now in Leyden. T h e version in the tomb of Neferhotep at Thebes ( T o m b N o . 50, about 1350-1320 B.C.) was somewhat different. T h e title given below shows that the original was ascribed to the reign of one of the Intef kings before or after the Twelfth Dynasty. T h e theme may have been characteristic of the groping for value which followed the collapse of the Old Kingdom. However, the use of the text in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties shows that this hedonism was an acceptable literary expression for some centuries.
M. Lichtheim studied this and other harper's songs in JNES, iv (1945), 178 if., translation on pp. 192 f., bibliography on pp. 211 f. The present translation is made from W. M. Müller, Die Uebespoesie der alten Aegypter (2nd printing, Leipzig, 1932), Pis. 13-15.* (See Addenda).
The song which is in the House of King Intef, the triumphant, and which is before the singer with the harp.
Prosperous is he, this good prince, Even though good fortune may suffer harm!1 Generations pass away, and others remain Since the time of the ancestors.2 The gods who lived formerly rest in their pyramids, The beatified dead also, buried in their pyramids.3 (5) And they who built houses—their places are not. See what has been made of them! I have heard the words of Ii-em-hotep and Hor-dedef, With whose discourses men speak so much.4 What are their places (now) ? Their walls are broken apart, and their places are not
As though they had never been! There is none who comes back from (over) there, That he may tell their state, That he may tell their needs, That he may still our hearts, Until we (too) may travel to the place where they have gone.
1 The fate of death may not be happy, but this prince need not fear. The version in the tomb of Nefer-hotep, "How weary is this righteous prince; the goodly fortune has come to pass," makes death a kindly release. 2 The Nefer-hotep version, "Generations pass away since the time of the god, (but) young people come in their place," shows that the meaning is the transition from one generation to another. 3 The dead kings and nobles of older times. 4 Ii-em-hotep, the famous vizier of Djoser, and Hor-dedef, the son of Khufu, were traditional sages of Egypt. See p. 432, n.4.
Let thy desire flourish, In order to let thy heart forget the beatifications for thee.5 Follow thy desire, as long as thou shalt live. Put myrrh upon thy head and clothing of fine linen upon thee, (10) Being anointed with genuine marvels of the god's property. Set an increase to thy good things; Let not thy heart flag. Follow thy desire and thy good. Fulfill thy needs upon earth, after the command of thy heart, Until there come for thee that day of mourning. The Weary [of Heart] hears not their [ mourn ]ing,8 (vii 1) And wailing saves not the heart of a man from the underworld.
R E F R A I N : Make holiday, and weary not therein! Behold, it is not given to a man to take his property with him. Behold, there is not one who departs who comes back again!
Love Songs
T h e later Egyptian Empire (1300-1100 B.C.) has provided us with several collections of love songs. They were apparently intended to be sung to the accompaniment of some musical instrument. They express an enjoyment of nature and the outof-doors. As in the Song of Songs, the lovers are called "my brother" and "my sister."*

I say to thee: "See what I am doing!" I have come from setting my trap with my (own) hand;
In my hand are my bait and my snare.
All the birds of Punt, they alight in Egypt, Anointed with myrrh.1 The first one comes and takes my worm. Its fragrance is brought from Punt, And its talons are full of resin. My wish for thee is that we loose them together, When I am alone with thee, That I might let thee hear the cry Of the one anointed with myrrh. How good it would be
If thou wert there with me When I set the trap! The best is to go to the fields, To the one who is beloved! T H E END.

1 Punt, a land on the Arabian Sea, was famous for gums and perfumes. The theme of this song is that the maiden has been catching birds from the lands of fragrant gums, and she wishes that her "brother" might join her in this pastime, with its implications of rich perfumes and merrymaking. cf. the frequent references to myrrh and spices in the Song of Songs, chap. 4 and 5. 2 Where are you walking in the early morning? The swallow invites the maiden to the pleasures of the open fields. She, however, seeks out the company of her "brother." cf. Song of Songs 2 : 1 2 - 1 3 , with "the voice of die turtle-dove." 8 Though a flowing stream with lurking crocodiles lies between the youth and his "sister," the love of her is a magic charm to carry him successfully across to her. cf. Song of Songs 8:7.
My heart is great upon the stream, And the waves are like land unto my feet. It is the love of her that makes me steady, For it makes a Water-charm for me! When I see my sister coming, My heart dances, And my arms open wide to embrace h e r , . . . When the mistress comes to me. T H E END.

My heart intended to see Nefrus,B That I might sit in her home. But I found Mehy driving on the road, Together with his gallants. I know not how to take me from his presence, That I might pass him freely by. See, river is like road, And I know not the place of my feet. Very foolish art thou, my heartWherefore wouldst thou make free with Mehy ? Behold, if I pass by before him, I shall tell him of my waverings; "Behold, I am thine!" I shall say to him; And he will boast of my name And assign me to the foremost harem Of those who are in his retinue.

SEVENTH STANZA."
Seven (days) to yesterday I have not seen the sister, And a sickness has invaded me. My body has become heavy, Forgetful of my own self.7 If the chief of physicians come to me, My heart is not content (with) their remedies; The lector priests,8 no way (out) is in them:My sickness will not be probed.
4 Papyrus Beatty I , C , contains " T H E BEGINNING OF T H E SPEECHES OF GREAT E N T E R T A I N M E N T , " with seven numbered stanzas, of which this is the third. By a characteristic Egyptian literary device, there is a pun on die word "third" at the beginning and end of the stanza: khemet "three," khemet "intended," and imiu-khetef " w h o are in his retinue." B The translation depends for good sense on treating two words as proper names, even though they are not properly determined as names: nefrus "her beauty," and mehy " f l a x . " Possibly there was some colloquially known implication in these two terms. It would then seem that the maiden went out to visit a girl friend and unexpectedly met her "brother" riding with other lusty youths. She was covered with confusion and feared that her emotions might be so obvious that he would scorn her and turn her over to one of his group. 6 cf. n.4 above. Here the word "seven" is employed in place of a pun. The theme of the song is that of Song of Songs 2:5 or 5:8: "I am sick from love." Physicians and magicians cannot diagnose or cure die youth's ailment, but the mere sight of his "sister" will make him well. 7 Often in the sense of losing consciousness. 8 Who read magic spells for the cure of disease.



SECULAR SON
«
To say to me: "Here she is!" is what will revive me; Her name is what will lift me up; The going in and out of her messengers Is what will revive my heart. More beneficial to me is the sister than any remedies; She is more to me than the collected writings. My health is her coming in from outside: When (I) see her, then (I) am well. If she opens her eye, my body is young (again); If she speaks, then I am strong (again); When I embrace her, she drives evil away from meBut she has gone forth from me for seven days!

Also from Papyrus Beatty I, verso G i 5-ii 1. Gardiner, op. cit Pis. xxix-xxx, p. 35.
Would that thou wouldst come (to the sister speedily),9 Like a horse of the king, Picked from a thousand of all steeds, The foremost of the stables! It is distinguished in its food, And its master knows its paces. If it hears the sound of the whip, It knows no delay, And there is no foremost of the chasseurs10 Who can stay before it (to hold it). How well the sister's heart knows That he is not far from the sister! THE END.
Songs of the Common People
WORKERS IN THE FIELD
Many of the working songs in the modern Near East are antiphonal, with a leader and a chorus. Scenes and legends suggest that the same was true in antiquity, although it is difficult to present a single clear case. T h e following two songs are separated in the scene in which they occur: the first is attached to a group of plowmen and the second to a near-by group of reapers. T h e general similarity of words and the "answering refrain" justify their juxtaposition here. The texts are in an agricultural scene in an Eighteenth Dynasty (i6th-i4th centuries B.C.) tomb at el Kab, published by J. J. Tylor, The Tomb of Paheri (Wall Drawings and Monuments of El Kab, London, 1895), Pis. rv-v.
Over the Plowmen
A good day—it is cool. The cattle are pulling,
9 This is one of three stanzas. Since the other two stanzas begin: "Would that thou wouldst come to the sister quickly," it is clear that the text here should be so completed. T h e first stanza expresses the maiden's hope that her "brother" will come to her as swifdy as a royal couritr, the third stanza that he would come as swifdy as a gazelle bounding over the desert. Here we have the second stanza, longing that he come as swiftly as die fastest horse of the royal stables, cf. Song of Songs 1 :<): "I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots." For the gazelle as a figure of swift arrival, cf. Song of Songs 2:8-9; 8 : 1 4 . 10 Teher, a foreign word (perhaps Hittite) for a chariot-warrior; cf. p. 239, n.3.
S A N D P O E M S 469
And the sky does according to our desireLet us work for the noble!
Over the Reapers
The answering refrain which they say: This good day is come forth in the land; The north wind is come forth, And the sky does according to our desireLet us work as our hearts may be bound!
A Threshing Song
In the same scene, a herdsman is shown driving his cattle around and around to thresh out the grain. He urges them that their monotonous labor is easy and profitable.
Thresh ye for yourselves, thresh ye for yourselves, O cattle! Thresh ye for yourselves, thresh ye for yourselves! Straw to eat, and barley for your mastersLet not your hearts be weary, for it is cool.
A SONG OF THE HERDSMAN
In scenes of earlier times, as the herdsman drives his sheep to tread out the grain, he sings a song which, in humorous allusion, implies that he is out of his usual place. The text occurs in the same setting in two Sakkarah tombs of the Old Kingdom (25th-24th centuries B.C.). It is given in A . Erman, Reden, Rufe und Lieder des alten Reiches (APAW, 1919), 19-20, and translated in Erman, LAE, 131.*
The herdsman is in the water among the fish: He talks with the shad And greets the oxyrhynchus fish. O west, where is the herdsman (now), The herdsman of the west?
A SONG OF THE CARRIERS OF A PALANQUIN
Three Old Kingdom scenes which depict a noble traveling in a palanquin give the words of the porters. The recurring words, "It is pleasanter full than when it is empty," link these three together in the recognized refrain of a song. The longest of these texts is the most difficult, and only the concluding words can be translated with certainty. It comes from the Dahshur tomb of Ipi, and is now Cairo Museum 1536, published by L. Borchardt, Denkmäler des alten Reiches I {Catalogue gineral... du MusSe du Caire, Berlin 1937), 240. TTbe following translation follows the imaginative rendering of W. Wreszinski in OLZ, xxvi (1923), 309-12, which has the merit of giving the feeling of the song, even though some of the words remain uncertain.
Go down into the palanquin, and it is sound! Go down into the palanquin, and it is well!
The carrying-poles are on the support of the carriers. O palanquin of Ipi, be as heavy as I wishIt is pleasanter full than when it is empty!
SONGS AT A FEAST
An annual feast at Luxor had as its central feature the journey of the god Amon and of the pharaoh by boat between Karnak and Luxor. In scenes of the time of Tut-ankh-Amon (about 1361-1352 B.C.) in the Temple of Luxor, this ceremonial



470 S E C U L A R S O N G S A N D P O E M S
procession is shown, and there are two brief songs about a drinking place set up for the entertainment of the sailors of the god's boat. Each song is credited to the goddess Neith. One of them follows, as published by W. Wolf, Das schdne Fest von Opet (Leipzig, 1931), 56-57, ( N o . 15 a,b), and by K. Sethe in ZAeS, LXIV (1929), 1-5.
A drinking place has been built for the menials who are in the ship of ships. The ways of the earth god have been hacked open for (thee), O Nile, great and high! Mayest thou satisfy thy Two Goddesses For Horus, the strong of arm, When the god is rowed, carrying the beauty of the god.1 Hat-Hor has effected the beauty of good things For King (Tut-ankh-Amon), beloved of Amon and favored of the gods. So says Neith.
Close by this song there are depicted eight women with sistrum-rattles and eight priests clapping their hands in measure. The text (Wolf, op. cit., 57 [No. 15, c ] ) relates them to the songs of the entire scene.
The chorus which sets the measure while the journey takes place upon the river: 0 Amon, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, thou livest forever!
In the same large scene units of soldiers swing along in gay and vigorous movement, with some of the Negro troops breaking out in jubilant dance. Over the heads of the soldiers their songs of festivity are written (Wolf, op. cit., 63-64 [No. 34]).
[The leaders of] the army. They rejoice in front of his majesty: "How happy is the good ruler when he has conveyed Amon, for He decreed to him valor against the south and victory against [the north]! Amon [is the god who decreed] the victory to the ruler!"2 [The soldiers] who are following his majesty. The chorus of jubilation which they utter: "King (Tutankh-Amon) is conveying Him who begot him! Decreed for him was kingship from the beginning of the lifetime of Re in heaven. He is rewarded with valor and victory over every foreign country that attacks him. Amon decreed the victory to King (Tut-ankh-Amon)! Amon*is the god who decreed the victory to the ruler!"
Another song of military triumph, presumably sung by returning soldiers, will be found on p. 228 above.
In Praise of the City Ramses
The pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty established their residence city, the biblical Ramses or Raamses, in the north
1 The divine pharaoh is rowed, transporting the image of the god Amon. 2 The triumphant words, "Amon is the god who decreed the victory to the ruler!" may be followed from the texts of Hat-shepsut (about 14861469 B . C . ) to Ramses I V (about 1 1 6 4 - 1 1 5 7 B . C . ) , with at least fifteen occurrences and perhaps a partial recurrence under Pi-ankhi (about 720 B . C . ) . Its setting is always some scene or text of triumphant return. See

T H E BEGINNING OF THE RECITAL of the might of the Lord of Egypt. His majesty—life, prosperity, health!—has built himself a castle, the name of which is "Great of Victories." It is between Djahi2 and Egypt, and is full of food and provisions. It is like unto Hermonthis,8 and its lifetime is like (that of) Memphis. The sun rises in its horizon, and sets within it. All men have left their towns and are settled in its territory. Its west is the House of Amon, its south the House of Seth. Astarte appears in its orient, and Uto in its north.4 The castle which is in it is like the horizon of heaven. Ramses Meri-Amon is in it as a god, Montu-in-the-Two-Lands as a herald, Sun-ofRulers as a vizier, and Joy-of-Egypt (ii 1) Beloved-ofAtum as a mayor.5 (Thus) the land comes down into its (proper) place. The Great Prince of Hatti sent (a message) to the Prince of Kode:6 "Prepare thyself, that we may hasten to Egypt and say: 'The will of the god is come to pass,'7 that we may make words of blandishment to Usermaat-Re®—life, prosperity, health! He gives breath to whom he will, and every foreign country exists (only)
1 The location of Ramses has been much disputed, and scholars are not yet in agreement. For its location at Tanis, modern San el-Hagar in the northeastern Delta, see A. H. Gardiner in JEA, xix ( 1 9 3 3 ) , 1 2 2 ff.; xxx ( 1 9 4 4 ) , 60; and R. Weill in JEA, x x i ( 1 9 3 5 ) , 17 f f . For a view that Ramses may have been at modern Qantir, about 15 miles south of San el-Hagar, cf. W. C. Hayes, Glazed Tiles from a Palace of Ramesses at Kantir (Metropolitan Museum of Art Papers, No. 3, N e w York, 1 9 3 7 ) , 8* 8 Centrally die Phoenician coast, but carrying down into Palestine. 8 An old cult-center south of Thebes. •Temples of the gods mark the four quarters of the city. The Semitic goddess Astarte is appropriately in the east. The Egyptian goddess Uto is sometimes called Buto modernly. 5 Ramses II is a god of the city, and, through his epithets, is all the important administrators. 6 Kode or Qedi was the north Phoenician coast, carrying into Cilicia. The present section does not deal with the city Ramses, but with a projected visit by the Hittite king to Egypt. This may have fallen shortly before Ramses H's 21st year, in which he signed a treaty with Hatti. cf. pp. 199-201 and 256-258 above, ad Breasted, AR, 111,$$425-26; E. Cavaignac, Ltgypte et le Hatti vers 1301, in Melanges Maspero (Cairo, 1 9 3 4 ) , 1, 357-60.
7 The god would be Ramses II, and the statement would be an expression of submission by Hatti and Kode to Egypt. 8 Ramses II.

through the love of him. Hatti is in his power alone. If the god receives not its offering, it does not see the water of heaven, for it is in the power of User-maat-Relife, prosperity, health!—the bull that loves valor!"9
THE END.
The Scribe Pai-Bes communicating to his lord, the Scribe Amen-em-Opet: In life, prosperity, health! It is a letter to let [my] lord know. Another communication to my lord, to wit:10 I have reached Per-Ramses,11 and have found (ii i) it in [very, very] good condition, a beautiful district, without its like, after the pattern of Thebes. It was [Re] himself [who founded it.] The Residence is pleasant in life; its field is full of everything good; it is (full) of supplies and food every day, its ponds with fish, and its lakes with birds. Its meadows are verdant with grass; its banks bear dates; its melons are abundant on the sands. . . . Its granaries are (so) full of barley and emmer (that) they come near to the sky. Onions and leeks (5) are for food, and lettuce of the garden, pomegranates, apples, and olives, figs of the orchard, sweet wine of -Ka-of-Egypt,12 surpassing honey, red wed)-fish of the canal of the Residence City, which live on lotus-flowers, bedin-fish of the Han-waters,.. The Shi-Hor14 has salt, and the Her canal has natron.
9 If Ramses does not receive Haiti's offer of submission, Ramses is able to withhold rain from Hatti. cf. p. 257 above. 10 Pai-Bes, the pupil, is writing to Amen-em-Opet, his master.

The young men of "Great of Victories" are dressed up every day, with sweet oil upon their heads and newly dressed hair. They stand beside their doors, their hands bowed down with flowers, with greenery of the House of Hat-Hor and flax of the Her candy on the day when User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re —life, prosperity, health!—Montu-in-the-Two-Lands enters in, on the morning of the Feast of Khoiakh.18 (5) Every man is like his fellow in uttering their petitions.

Presumably the Tanite branch of the Nile, with its saltflats. 15 No one feels a lack in the city Ramses. 16 The "feasts of the sky" were those astronomically set, such as those of the phases of the moon. The seasonal feasts included the Coronation Feast, the Rising of the Dog-Star, the Feast of Opet, etc., which recurred with regularity. 17 The word used appears also in Hebrew in "the Sea of Reeds" (conventionally translated "Red Sea").

An Egyptian Letter
T R A N S L A T O R : JOHN A . W I L S O N
A Satirical Letter
This text was one of the admired literary compositions of the late Empire and was used for the instruction of apprentice scribes. A royal official Hori received a letter from a scribe Amen-em-Opet. Hori responded in lofty and sarcastic vein, attempting to expose the weaknesses in his correspondent's qualifications for office. A particular value for our purposes is the summary catalogue of places in the Egyptian empire in Asia. Papyrus Anastasi I (British Museum 10247) is of the late Nineteenth Dynasty (end of the 13th century B.C.) and probably comes from Memphis. In addition, from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, there are three fragmentary papyri and about fifty ostraca, schoolboy exercises. Facsimiled in Select Papyri in the Hieratic Character from the Collections of the British Museum, n (London, 1842), Pis. XXXV-LXII. The standard study of the text was made by A. H. Gardiner, Egyptian Hieratic Texts. Series I. Part I. The Papyrus Anastasi I and the Papyrus Roller Together with the Parallel Texts (Leipzig, 1911).

The Writer
THE SCRIBE, CHOICE OF HEART, persevering of counsel,
for whose utterances there is rejoicing when they are heard, skilled in the Word of God,1 (for) there is nothing which he does not know. He is a hero valiant in the work of Seshat,2 a servant of the Lord of Hermopolis8 in his bureau of writing, the teacher of apprentices in the Office of Writings, the first of his fellows, foremost of his colleagues, prince of his generation, without any like unto him (5) . . . Swift is he in inscribing empty scrolls, a youth distinguished of appearance and pleasing of charm, who can explain the difficulties of the annals like him who composed them. All that issues from his mouth is steeped in honey, and the heart is treated therewith as if (with) medicines. The groom of his majesty—life, prosperity, health!—the attendant of the Lord—life, prosperity, health!—who trains the steeds of the Sovereign. He is an energetic digger (ii 1) for the stable Hori, son of Wen-nofer, of Abydos, the Island of the Righteous, born of Ta-Usert in the district of Bilbeis, the Singer of Bastet in the Field of the God.4

Criticism of Amen-em-Opets Letter
ANOTHER MATTER, to wit: Thy letter (iv 6 ) reached me in an hour of relaxing for a while. I found thy message as I was sitting beside the horse which is in my charge. I rejoiced and was glad and ready to answer. When I went into thy" stall to look at thy letter, I found that it was neither praises nor insults. Thy statements mix up this with that; all thy words are upside-down; they are not connected (v 1) (So) I write to thee to instruct thee, like a friend teaching one greater than himself to be an excellent scribe. Now as for me, when thou speakest, I shall answer it. Lo, thy speeches are {only) idle7 talk. Thou makest thyself like one agitated to scare me. (5) But I am not in dread before thee, (for) I know thy nature. So I thought that thou wouldst answer it all by thyself. (But) lo, thy supporters stand behind thee.® Thou hast gathered many fowlerf as helpers, like those who would be (gathered) for a law court. Thy face is wild, as thou standest wheedling the backers, saying: "Come with me, that ye may give me a hand!" Thou presentest them with gifts for each man, and they say [to] thee: "Let thy heart be steadfast. We shall attack him." Thou standest in agitation . . . , and they sit deliberating, (vi 1) the six scribes.10 . . . (vii 1) . . . Thy letter is (too) inferior to permit that one listen to i t . . . If thou hadst known beforehand that it was no good, thou wouldst not have sent i t . . . .

7 "Cool," perhaps in the sense of spiritless or vain. 8 Hori intimates that Amen-em-Opet cannot write a letter without help. 9 The word may be corrupt. If correct, the sense would be that common
persons like catchers of birds were helping Amen-em-Opet; gathered as he
might gather witnesses for a law court 10 "Scribes" is of course sarcastic. The text goes on to detail how each
of six assistants contributes to Amen-em-Opet's own confusion.

I did (it) by myself! I did not call to a scribe to have him witness (it). I shall give thee more in twenty parts; I shall repeat for thee what thou hast said, (each) part in its place, the fourteen sections (of) thy letter. Fill my hand with papyrus, and I shall tell thee many things and pour out for thee choice things, (viii 1) . .. All my words are sweet and pleasant; that is, I do not act like thee, w h e n . . . thou beginnest to me with insults in the first part and dost not greet me at the beginning of thy letter. Far from me is what thou hast said; it does not come near, for my god Thoth is a shield about m e . . . . (5) . . . Why am I evil in thy heart, so that thou shouldst slander me ? To whom have I mentioned thee with evil words ? I (only) composed for thee a volume like a (work of) entertainment, at hearing which men are amused as (at) a sport.12 AGAIN THOU HAST SAID of me: "Crippled of arm and without strength." Thou dost minimize me as a scribe when thou sayest: "He does not know (anything)." I shall not spend a moment (ix 1) beside thee, wheedling thee and saying: "Be my supporter: another man is troubling me!" . . . I know many men without strength, crippled of arm, feeble, and without their force, but they are rich in houses, in supplies and food, and they speak no wish [about] anything. Come, let me tell thee the nature of the scribe Rey, (5) who was called the firebrand of the granary. He did not stir nor run since his birth. His abomination was energetic work, and he would not know it. (Yet) he is resting in the West, with his body whole, and terror of the good god has not carried him o f f . 1 " . . . (x 1) . . . Let me tell thee of Pa-hery-pedjet, who is in Heliopolis. [He is an] old man [of] the Palace—life, prosperity, health! He is smaller than a tomcat (but) bigger than an ape, and he is in good state in his (own) house Thou hast heard the name of Ki-sep, . . . who goes on the ground without being noticed, unkempt of clothing and firmly wrapped up. If thou shouldst see him in the evening in the dark, then thou wouldst say of him: "A bird that is passing by." Put him in the scale that thou mayest see (5) how heavy he is. He will come out for thee at twenty deben,14 not counting old clothes. If thou blowest beside him as he is passing by, he will fall far down
like a leaf of foliage O Who-is-it,16 my friend who knows not what he says, see, I solve thy grievous difficulties and make them easy! T H O U ART COME (xi 1 ) provided with great mysteries, and thou tellest me a saying of Hor-dedef,16 (although) thou knowest not [whether it is] good or bad. What chapter is before it, what after it? Now thou art a scribe of experience at the head of his colleagues. The teaching of every book is engraved upon thy heart
11 Amen-em-Opet took offense at Hori's previous letter, which had been
intended as playful rather than malicious.
11 Despite his laziness, Rey rests content in death. Hon now follows with
accounts of three other officials who were successful despite handicaps.
14 Not quite four pounds. 16 What's-Your-Name, a lofty pretended forgetfulness of Amen-em-Opet's
name.
16 One of the traditional wise men of Egypt, cf. p. 432, n.4. For his
"wisdom," cf. pp. 419-420.
How felicitous is thy tongue, corresponding to thy words! A saying comes out from thy mouth at more than three deben (weight).17 . . . My eyes are dazzled by what thou doest, and I am astonished when thou sayest: "I am more profound (5) as a scribe than heaven or earth or the underworld. I know the mountains in deben and hinl"1* (But) the House of Books is hidden; it is not visible; its Ennead is concealed and far from \thy sight]. Tell me what thou knowest; then I shall answer thee: "Beware lest thy fingers approach the Word of God!"19... (In the context not translated here, Hori sets Amenem-Opet a number of tests of calculation or administration, to demonstrate that Amen-em-Opet is incapable as a responsible government official.)
The Problem of a Military Mission
O alert SCRIBE, understanding of heart, who is not ignorant at all, (xvii 3) torch in the darkness at the head of the troops—and it gives light to them! Thou art sent on a mission to Djahan20 at the head of the victorious army, to crush those rebels called Near in.21 The bowmen of the army which is before thee amount to 1,900, the Sherden 520, the Qeheq 1,600, the Meshwesh (/oo), and the Negroes 880—TOTAL 5,000 in (5) all, not counting their officers.22 There is brought thee a peace offering before thee: bread, cattle, and wine. The number of men is too great for thee, whereas the provisions are too small for t h e m . . . . Thou receivest them, placed in the camp. The troops are ready and prepared. Make them quickly into portions, that of each man at his hand. The Bedouin look on furtively, (saying): "Sopher yodeaY'2* Midday is come, the camp is hot. "Time to start! Don't let the troop commander be angry! Much marching is ahead of us. What bread have we at all? (xviii 1) Our night-quarters are far away. O Who-is-it,24 what does it mean, this beating of us ?" So thou art an experienced scribe, if thou (canst) approach to give the provisions, (but) an hour comes into a day for lack of a scribe from the Ruler—life, prosperity, health!2" "This (business of) bringing thee to beat us—it's no good, my boy\ He2e will hear and will send to destroy thee!"

whether this is a large expedition or a small punitive force. Of die 5,000,
1,900 were Egyptian. The Sherden were of the "Peoples of the Sea," like
the Philistines, cf. p. 255b, n.2. The Qeheq and Meshwesh were Libyans. 28 Semitic: "O wise scribe!" 24 See n.15 above.

Thou hast [not] trodden the road to the Magur, where the sky is darkened by day and it is overgrown with cypresses and oaks and cedars which reach the heavens. Lions are more numerous than leopards or bears, (and it is) surrounded by Bedouin on (every) side of it. Thou hast not climbed the mountain of Shawef barefooty thy hands (5) laid upon [thy bow\y thy chariot laced with ropes, thy horse in tow. Pray let [me tell thee of] . . . -beret. Thou art dismayed (at) climbing it and crossest its stream above it. (Thus) thou seest the taste of (being) a mahiry with thy chariot laid upon thy [shoulder] and thy {assistant] tired out. Thou reachest a halt in the evening, with thy whole body crushed and battered, thy [members] belabored,... thyself in sleep.
Thou awakest, (xx 1) for it is the hour of starting in the sic\ly night. Thou art alone for the harnessing; no brother comes for a brother. The snea\-thieves*z have entered into [the] camp, the horse is untied, the . . . has been lost in the night, and thy clothes have been stolen. Thy groom awoke in the night, saw what he8S had done, and took what was left. He has entered among those who are wicked, he has mingled with the Bedouin tribes, and he has made himself into the likeness of an Asiatic. (5) The foe had come to raid furtively and found thee inert. When thou awakest, thou findest no trace of them, and they have carried off thy property. (Thus) thou art become a fully equipped mahir, as thou fillest thy ear.84
LET ME TELL THEE OF another strange city, named Byblos. What is it like? And its goddess? Once again[thou] hast not trodden it. Pray, instruct me about Beirut, about Sidon and Sarepta. Where is the stream (xxi 1) of the Litani? What is Uzu like?35 They say

Sessi was a nickname of Ramses II, who must have had some special interest in that town. 81 Since Tubikhi was in Syria and the other towns here identifiable are northern, this Kadesh is probably that on the Orontes. 32 Apparendy from the Semitic root nahar "to flow," here in a feminine noun, perhaps collective, "the band of gliders"? 88 Sic, but read "they." 84 With this experience. 88 Old Tyre on the mainland.

Where does the Achshaph road come ? (5) At what town ? Pray, teach me about the mountain of User. What is its head87 like? Where does the mountain of Shechem come? Where does the mahir make the journey to Hazor? What is its stream like? Put me (on) the track to Hamath, Deger, and Deger-El, the promenade ground of every mahir. (xxii 1) Pray, teach me about its road and show me Yan. If one is traveling to Adummimy which way is the face? Do not shrink from thy teaching! Guide us (to) know them! COME, that I may tell thee other towns which lie above them. Thou hast not gone to the land of Takhshi,88 Kur-mereren, Timnat, Kadesh, Deper, Azai, or Harnaim. Thou hast not seen Kiriath-Anab and (5) Beth-Sepher. Thou dost not know Adurun*or Zedpet either. Thou dost not know the name of Khenrez, which is in the land of Upi,39 the bull upon its boundary, the place where the battle array of every hero may have been seen. Pray, teach me about the appearance of Qiyen, let me know Rehob, explain Beth-Shan and Tirqa-El. The stream of (xxiii 1) Jordan, how is it crossed? Let me know the way to pass Megiddo, which is above it. Thou art a mahir, experienced in deeds of heroism. A mahir such as thou art should be found (able) to stride at the head of an army! O maryanu,40 forward to shoot! Behold, the ambuscade is in a ravine two thousand cubits deep, filled with boulders and pebbles. Thou makest a detoury as thou graspest the bow. Thou makest a feint to thy left, that thou mightest make the chiefs to see, (but) (5) their eyes are good and thy hand falters. "Abata \ama ir, mahir ne'am !"41 (Thus) thou makest a name for every mahir, officers of Egypt! Thy name becomes like (that of) Qazardi, the Chief of Aser,42 when the bear found him in the balsam tree. The narrow valley is dangerous with Bedouin, hidden under the bushes.

If it should be thrown toward the abyss, thy collar-piece would be left uncovered and thy girth would fall.

A Sumerian Letter
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Letter of King Ibbi-Sin
This document is of considerable importance to the modern historian; it provides us with a lively and probably contemporary account of the troubled conditions of the last years of the Third Dynasty of Ur.1 It purports to be a letter addressed by Ibbi-Sin, the last ruler of the Third Dynasty of Ur,2 to Puzur-Numushda, the governor of Kazallu,8 and it refers primarily to events involving Ishbi-Irra, Ibbi-Sin's mortal enemy and founder of the Dynasty of Isin.4 Its contents run approximately as follows:5 Following the conventional letter heading (lines 1-3) and two lines whose meaning is at present obscure (lines 4-5), we find Ibbi-Sin complaining to Puzur-Numushda that he (i.e. the latter) and a fellow governor by the name of Qirbubu had failed to come to his support at a crucial moment in the struggle with Ishbi-Irra (lines £14). Ibbi-Sin then continues with an admission that Enlil, the leading deity of the Sumerian pantheon, had indeed bestowed the kingship on Ishbi-Irra, the man of Man,® who is not a Sumerian, and that the latter seems to be on the verge of subjecting all Sumer to his rule (lines 15-31).7 Nevertheless he ends the letter on a note of optimism; with the help of the Martu,8 Ishbi-Irra and the Elamites9 will be defeated
1 Unfortunately the authenticity of the contents of the document, at least as it now lies before us, is open to question. On the surface, to be sure, it seems to be a bona fide copy of a letter addressed by the king Ibbi-Sin to his governor Puzur-Numushda; the heading is that in common use for letters from one individual to another. But there are several factors which tend to indicate that, at least in part, it was a literary fabrication of the Sumerian scribes who lived quite some time after the struggle between Ibbi-Sin and Ishbi-Irra which resulted in the end of the Third Dynasty of Ur. In the first place it is important to bear in mind that the present text, as we have it, can be only a copy of the original letter, if one ever existed; the script dates from a time considerably later than the Ur III period. Secondly, we now have three copies of the letter, and in the course of time, several more may be uncovered. Obviously, therefore, this letter—and there are also examples of letters purported to be written by Ibbi-Sin and a well-known Isin ruler, Lipit-Ishtar—was treated by the teachers of the Nippur scribal schools as a kind of practice composition for the use of their students. Moreover, the contents of the letter, particularly the passage describing Enlil's harsh decisions against Sumer and Ur (lines 15-24), have a literary flavor which seems rather incongruous in a prosaic letter written for an immediate and practical end. Finally, in the matter of grammar, the text before us follows principles current in post Ur III days; that is, if there was an original letter from Ibbi-Sin to Puzur-Numushda, its text was tampered with and "modernized." But no matter how and why the later scribes modified the original text of the letter, its historical portions are no doubt authentic. Indeed, even if we assume that the document before us is a literary fiction of the later scribes, and that no such letter was ever written by Ibbi-Sin, it is still reasonable to assume that its historical details were not invented, but were based on actual data available to the scribes.
2 The Third Dynasty of Ur ruled from approximately the middle of the twenty-first century to the middle of the twentieth century B.C. * The exact location of Kazallu is still unknown; it is generally assumed to be east of the Tigris. 4 After the fall of the Third Dynasty of Ur, the control of Babylonia was in the hands of two dynasties who ruled simultaneously for many years; the one was established by Ishbi-Irra at Isin, about 30 kilometers south of Nippur, and the other at Larsa, not far from Ur. 5 As the all too frequent italics show, the text is at times difficult to translate, and the context is not infrequently obscure; the interpretation here presented and based largely on Falkenstein's study, seems to be the most probable on the available data, but is far from assured. 8 Man is situated on the Euphrates more than three hundred kilometers northwest of Nippur; in spite of its distance from the center of Sumer, the city played at times an important role in Sumerian affairs, and a Man Dynasty ruled over Sumer as early as the middle of the third millennium B.C. 7 Note, however, that the meaning of lines 25-31 is very uncertain. 8 The Martu are the nomadic people who lived west of Sumer and are generally known by their Akkadian name Amurru.
and once again Sumer's might will become known throughout the foreign lands (lines 32-38).10 The text of this document is restored from three tablets excavated at Nippur and dating from the first half of the second millennium B.C.; all three are now located in the University Museum.11 One of these tablets was published by G. A. Barton as No. 9 of his Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions (1918); there, too, will be found a transliteration and translation of the text, pp. 57-59.12 The other two were published by Leon Legrain as Nos. 3 and 6 of PBS, XIII (1922); a transliteration and translation of their contents will be found there on pp. 28-32. The first to recognize that all three tablets contain copies of the same document was Stephen Langdon who published a partial transliteration and translation of the letter in RA, xx (1923), 49-51. But it is Adam Falkenstein who has prepared the first scientific edition of the text, including a complete transliteration, translation, and detailed commentary. Falkenstein's study, which appeared in ZA, XLIX (1949), 59-79, represents by all odds the most trustworthy effort to get at the meaning of the text, and the present translation is based primarily upon it.13
To Puzur-Numushda, the governor14 of Kazallu speak; thus says your king Ibbi-Sin. (4). . . . since I have selected for you — troops (and) have put them at your disposal as the governor of Kazallu, are not, as in my case,1* your troops your renown ?16 (6). Why did you send me thus: "Ishbi-Irra has17 his eyes on me, and (only) after he has left me will I come." (10) How is it that you did not know when Ishbi-Irra will return to (his) land?18 ( 1 1 ) Why did not you together with Qirbubu, the governor of Girkal,19 march forth the troops which had been placed in your hand before
9 According to the present rendering of the relevant passage (lines 35-36), the Elamites were the enemies of Ibbi-Sin and the allies of Ishbi-Irra; this agrees with the later tradition that Ibbi-Sin was carried off to Elam as a captive, as well as with the "Lamentation over the Destruction of U r " (cf. p. 460 of this volume), where it is stated that it was the Elamites who were largely responsible for the destruction of Ur. However the meaning of the crucial verb in line 36 is quite uncertain, and Falkenstein's rendering assumes that the Elamites were the allies, not the enemies, of Ibbi-Sin. 10 As later events proved, Ibbi-Sin's optimism was quite unjustified. Following his defeat and the destruction of Ur, the Sumerians gradually disappeared from the military and political scene. 11 One of these tablets originally contained the entire text of the letter, while the other two contained only extracts, one being inscribed with lines 1-21 and the other with lines 21-38. 12 Barton was under the impression that the text was an oracle of IshbiIrra. 18 Important variations from Falkenstein's renderings will be indicated in the notes. The present writer has also had the opportunity of collating the three tablets, and the results of this collation will be noted in their place. 14 "Governor" renders die Sumerian word ensi(%), more commonly known in its Akkadian form ishakjy*. 15 Literally, "like me." 16 Presumably the implication of this difficult sentence is that PuzurNumushda should have proceeded with his troops against Ishbi-Irra instead of procrastinating. Falkenstein's rendering, which is grammatically quite as justifiable as the present translation, reads: Since I have (sent) you selected . . . troops, they stood at your disposal as governor of Kazallu. But while I was all for (you), not so your troops (and) your levies. 17 The last sign in this line is miscopied; it is probably GAR.
1 8 As Falkenstein correctly surmised, the end of line 10 reads a-gim( 1) nu-e( l)-zu.
19 Reading of last part of name is uncertain.

surmised the reading of several of the miscopied signs. 21 The verb read mu-un-git; the sign A following -un- is a miscopy. 22 The three dots stand for a destroyed sign which may have given the name of the land.
23 "Land" here refers to Sumer. 24 In PBS, xin, No. 3, the sign u following ki-en-gi is a miscopy for PA. 25 Falkenstein renders this line as: Until the enemy plunders (everything) in Ur.
26 To judge from the context "will measure out" should denote some destructive action.
27 That is presumably the inhabitants of the cities. 28 Falkenstein translates lines 25 f. as: If he (Ishbi-Irra) sets you up (now)

(Even) after you, like a . . . , hand over the city to the enemy29 and have become80 a faithful servant, IshbiIrra does not know (you).'1 (29) Now bring you (help)

With the restoration of the land to its (former) place, (its) might will become known throughout all the lands. It is urgent, do not
as governors of the several cities, they (really "you") will go over to Ishbi-Irra in accordance with the word of Enlil. 29 That is perhaps Ishbi-Irra. 80 Rendering assumes that the end of line 14 of Barton, Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions, No. 9 reads mu(!)-dim instead of ie-ni-nht.
31 That is, perhaps it means to say that Ishbi-Irra will not recognize his services to him. 32 That is, perhaps to Ur. 83 "Them" may perhaps refer to those whom he brought as help. 34 "His" refers to Ishbi-Irra. 33 The meaning of the Sumerian verb rendered as "strike down" is quite uncertain. Falkenstein, who assumes that the Elamites were allies of Ibbi-Sin, renders this same verb by "will stand at my side" and concludes that it is the Elamites who will capture Ishbi-Irra.

The Mari Letters
In 1935-38 Andr£ Parrot excavated the palace of king ZimriLim (about 1730-1700 B.C.) at Tell el-Hariri, ancient Mari on the Middle Euphrates. Among nearly 20,000 cuneiform tablets found in this palace were some 5,000 letters, mostly written by native Amorites (Northwestern Semites) in a Babylonian full of West-Semitic words and grammatical usages. Personal names, language and customs reflect the culture of the Patriarchal Age in Genesis. There is already a very extensive literature on the letters, only a few of the more important items of which can be listed hone. The principal edition of them is in Volumes xxn £f. of Music du Louvre: textes cunSiformes (1941-); Archives royales de Mart by G. Dossin, Charles-F. Jean, J. R. Kupper (1950-) give generally excellent translations (the first 5 parts are completely indexed in Vol. xv, 1954). For comprehensive surveys see Dossin, Syria, xix (1938), pp. 105-126; W. F. Albright, BASOR, No. 77, pp. 30 ff-, 78, pp. 23 ff.; W. von Soden, Welt des Orients, 1, pp. 187-204 (where a good bibliography and map will also be found). For historical orientation see also F. M. T h . Bohl, King Hammurabi of Babylon in the Setting of His Time (Amsterdam, 1946), and Dossin, Samsi-Addu Jer rot £Assyrie (Brussels, 1948). J. R- Kupper's monograph, Un gouvernement provincial dans le royaume de Mari (RA, XLI, 1947), pp. 149183, provides an excellent survey of the administrative system of Mari. A very good popular account of the results of the excavations of Mari, with particular attention to the letters, will be found in George E. Mendenhall's Mari, in the Biblical Archaeologist, xi (1948), pp. 1-19.

All the Benjaminites1 raised fire-signals.2 (10) From Samanum to Ilum-Muluk, from Ilum-Muluk to Mishlan, all the cities of the Benjaminites (15) of the Terqa district raised fire signals in response, and so far I have not ascertained the meaning of those signals.

On this nomadic group, opposed to the Banu Sim'al, "Children of the North (Left),** see G. Dossin, Melanges Dussaud, n, pp. 981-996. There is no reason to suppose that these Benjaminites are the same as the later biblical tribe. 2 On fire signals in the Mari Letters, with parallels from other ancient literature, including the Bible and the Lachish ostraca, see Dossin, RA, xxxv, pp. 174-186. With their aid the ancients were able to communicate with great rapidity over considerable distances.

Now let a light armed force go to raid the enemy column and capture informers." Thus Hammurabi spoke to me. I am sending Sakirum with three hundred troops to Shabazum, (20) and the troops which I have sent are one hundred fifty [Hanu], fifty Suhu, and one hundred troops from the bank of the Euphrates River; and there are three hundred troops of Babylon.

8 Cuneiform barum. In later times Balaam was just such a baru; cf. JBL, LXIII (1944), p. 231 and n.141. 4 This expression is always in Amorite, transcribed in cuneiform hay or am qatalum (Heb. qatol 'air); it means simply "make a treaty," which was solemnized by the sacrifice of a young ass, much as the later Saracens of St. Nilus' time sacrificed a camel. 5 On the meaning of these words and parallels from other ancient cultures see G. E. Mendenhall, BASOR, No. 133, pp. 26-30 (1954). The words meranum and hassum have their ordinary Akkadian meanings.

The Amarna Letters
In 1887 an Egyptian peasant woman discovered a collection of cuneiform tablets at Tell el-Amarna in Middle Egypt, the site of Akh-en-Aton's capital 111 the early fourteenth century B.C. These tablets were sold to European museums and private dealers; some of them escaped attention for nearly thirty years. Subsequendy excavation disclosed enough additional tablets to bring the total collection up to about 377 numbers. Almost all of them are letters belonging to the royal archives of Amenhotep III and his son AJih-en-Aton. Nearly 300 letters were written by Canaanite (or rarely Egyptian) scribes in Palestine, Phoenicia, and southern Syria, about half of them in Palestine proper. These letters are written in a conventional vulgar Akkadian, full of canaanitisms in grammar and vocabulary. Occasionally we find a letter written mostly in Canaanite with scattered Akkadian formulas and ideograms. They date from the last years of Amen-hotep III and the reign of his successor; a very few may date from the ephemeral reign of Akh-en-Aton's son-in-law and successor, Smenkhkere. The original publications, though antiquated, are important for the cuneiform texts: note especially H. Winckler and L. Abel, Der Thontafelfund von El Amarna, Berlin, 1889-90; C. Bezold and E. A. W. Budge, The Tell El-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, London, 1892. All the older material was reexamined and collated with the greatest care by the Norwegian Assyriologist, J. A. Knudtzon, in his invaluable transcription and translation, to which O. Weber added a detailed commentary and E. Ebeling a valuable glossary: Die ElAmarna-Tafeln (VAB, Vol. n ) , Leipzig, 1907-15. Since then the Berlin tablets were reedited admirably by O. Schroeder, Die Tontafeln von El-Amarna (Leipzig, 1915). S. A. B. Mercer's two-volume work, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets (Toronto, 1939), has no independent value and is full of errors not found in Knudtzon's edition.

Rib-Ad[di spoke] to the king, [his] lor[d, the Sungod of the lands.] Beneath the feet [of the king, my lord,] seven times, and seven times [I fall.] (5) I have written repeatedly for [garrison troops], but they were not given, [and] the king did [not] listen to the word[s of his servant] And I sent my courier to the palace, but [he returned] (10) empty-handed—he had no garrison troops. And when the peop[le erf] my [house] saw that silver was not given, they ridiculed me like the governors, my brethren, and they despised me. Further, I (15) went to Hamuniri, and my younger brother is estranging Byblos in order to give the city to the sons of 'Abdu-Ashirta. (20) When my brother saw that my courier came out (from Egypt) emptyhanded, (that) there were no garrison troops with him, he despised me, and so he committed a crime and drove me (25) from the city. Let the king not restrain (himself) at the deed of this dog! Behold, I cannot enter the land of Egypt I am an old man, there is grievous illness (30) in my body, and the king, my lord, knows that the gods of Byblos are holy, and the illness is severe; and my sin I have redeemed (by a vow) from the gods, so I have not entered (35) the presence of the king, my lord. But behold, my son, the servant of the king, my lord, I have sent before the king, my lord. Let the king hear the words of his servant, and let the king, my lord, give (40) archers, and let them take Byblos, lest rebellious troops and the sons of 'Abdu-Ashirta enter it, and the archers of the king, my lord, (then) need (46) to capture it (by force). Behold, many are the people who love me in the city; few are the rebels in it When an army of archers goes out and they hear (50) about the day of its arrival, then the city will return to the king, my lord. Let my lord know that I would die for him. When I am in the city, I will protect it for my lord, and my heart is fixed (55) on the king, my lord; I will not give the city to the sons of 'AbduAshirta.

1 This letter was dictated by Rib-Addi, prince of Byblos, to Akh-en-Aton (Amen-hotep IV) about 1370 B.C. or a litde later. TTie old enemy of RibAddi, 'Abdu-Ashirta of Amurru (land of the Amorites), was now dead, but his son, 'Aziru, and the latter's brothers continued to menace the territory of Byblos. At this time Rib-Addi had actually been forced to retire from his own city to the comparative safety of Berytus (Beirut), whose prince 'Ammuniri was related to him by marriage.

to give it to the sons of 'Abdu-Ashirta. Let the king, my lord, not hold back from (60) the city. Verily, there is very much silver and gold within it; in its temple there is much wealth. If they take it (the city), let the king my lord do as he please with his servant, but let him give the city Buruzilim (65) for my dwelling place,—behold, I am now with Hamuniri—since there is left but one city, namely, Buruzilim. The sons of 'Abdu-Ashirta were hostile, and I was afraid. When I went to Hamuniri (70) because of the sons of 'AbduAshirta when they were powerful against me and there was no breath of the mouth of the king to me, then I said to my lord: "Behold our city Byblos! There is much wealth of the king in it, the property (75) of our forefathers. If the king does not intervene for the city, all the cities of the land of Canaan will (no longer) be his. Let the king not ignore this deed!" Now I have sent thy servant, my son, to the king, my lord; let the king quickly send him back (80) with troops to take the city. If the king, my lord, be gracious to me and return me to the city, then I will guard it as before for the king, my lord.

Let the king not ignore (95) this grievous deed which was done to the lands of the king, my lord; but let the king rush archers to take the city immediately.

We know from the peculiar spelling and grammar, as well as from a great many Egyptian words and expressions translated literally from Egyptian, that the scribe who wrote die Abimilki letters was himself a native Egyptian, a fact which is not surprising, since the Amarna letters from the Egyptian court to Asiatic kings and chieftains were all written by Egyptian scribes who had learned cuneiform in the palace schools.

As for him who hearkens to the king, his lord, and serves him in his place, the Sun-god shall rise over him, and the sweet breath from the mouth of his lord shall give him life(\); (45) but as for him who hearkens not to the word of the king, his lord, his city shall perish, his dynasty shall perish, his name shall not exist in the whole land forever. Behold, the servant who hearkens to his lord(50) it shall be well with his city, it shall be well with his house; his name shall exist forever. Thou art the Sun-god who rises over me, and a brazen wall which is reared for me, and because of the mighty power of the king my lord (56), I am tranquil. Behold, I have said to the Sim-god, the father of the king, my lord, "When shall I see (60) the face of the king, my lord ?" But behold, I am guarding Tyre, the great city, for the king, my lord, until the mighty power of the king come out unto me, (65) to give water for me to drink, and wood to warm me.

Biryawaza (whose name was formerly read erroneously Namyawaza) was prince of Damascus under Egyptian suzerainty. All personal names (except Shuta) are Indo-Aryan. Magdal is the Migdol of Exod. 14:2, etc. s Biridiya was prince of Megiddo at the end of the reign of Amen-hotep IH and the beginning of the reign of A kh-en-A ton; his name is Indo-Aryan like most other princely names of northern Palestine at that time. Lab'ayu (whose name meant approximately "lion-like" in Canaanite) was prince of Shechem in the central hill-country and was constandy raiding the territory and caravans of his neighbors on all sides. 9 This is the latter part (all that is preserved) of a continued letter from Biridiya of Megiddo.

T o 1 the king, my lord, say: Thus Ba'lu-UR.SAG, thy servant At the feet of the king, my lord, seven times, seven times, I fall Let the king, my lord, know that (5) the two sons of a rebel against the king my lord, the two sons of Lab'ayu, have determined to destroy the land of the king, my lord, after their father's death. And let the king, my lord, know that (10) many days the two sons of Lab'ayu have accused me (saying): "Why hast thou given the town of Giti-padalla into the hand of the king, thy lord—the city which Lab'ayu, our father, captured?" (15) So thus the two sons of Lab'ayu spoke to me: "Declare war against the people of die land of Qena, because they slew our father; and if you do not declare war, then we are hostile to you." But I answered them: (20) "May the god of the king, my lord, preserve me from making war against the people of the land of Qena, the servants of the king, my lord!" Now may it be agreeable to the king, my lord, to send one of his officers to Biryawaza (25) and let him say to him: "Wilt thou march against the two sons of Lab'ayu, or art thou a rebel against the king?" And after him, let the king, my lord, send to me [ . . . ] the deed (30) rof the king,1 thy rlord\ against the two sons of Lab'ayu [ . . . ] Milkilu has gone in to them[ ? . . . ] (35) . . . rland of the king, my lord, with them after Milkilu and Lab'ayu died.1 (40) And thus the two sons of Lab'ayu spoke: "Be hostile to the king, thy lord, like our father, when he attacked Shunama and Burquna and Harabu, and (45) destroyed them/
7 This letter from the prince of Megiddo is very instructive because of the light it throws on forced labor for the king in the Plain of Esdraelon, several of whose towns and villages are mentioned. The word for "corvie" is the Hebrew mat, which is employed a litde later of the tribe of Issachar in this very region (Gen. 49:15). 8 The prince from whom this letter comes was in control of a district in the northern coastal plain of Palestine, south of Carmel. The death of Lab'ayu is described in EA, No. 245 (cf. n.6). Here his sons are described as continuing their father's activities. Biryawaza, whose help is wanted to subdue the recalcitrants, was prince of Damascus (cf. n.4). Milkilu was prince of Gezer, whose territory adjoined the territory of Ba'lu-UR.SAG ("Baal is a warrior") on the south.

smote them. And he took Giti-rimuni, and he betrayed the helpers of the king, thy lord." But I answered them: "The god of the king, my lord, preserve me from making (50) war against the king, my lord. The king, my lord, I serve, and my brothers who hearken to me." But the courier of Milkilu does not move from the two sons of Lab'ayu (55) a (single) day. Behold, Milkilu seeks to destroy the land of the king, my lord. But there is no other intention with meI serve the king, my lord, and the word which the king, my lord, speaks do I hear.

To the king, my lord, say: Thus Lab'ayu, thy servant. At the feet of my lord I fall. (5) As for what thou hast written, "Are the people strong who have captured the town? How can the men be arrested?" (I reply) "By fighting was the town captured, (10) in spite of the fact that I had taken an oath of conciliation and that, when I took the oath, an (Egyptian) officer took the oath with me! The city as well as my god are captured. I am slandered/blamed (15) before the king, my lord." Further, when (even) ants are smitten, they do not accept it (passively), but they bite the hand of the man who smites them. (20) How could I hesitate this day when two of my towns are taken ? Further, even if thou shouldst say: "(25) Fall beneath them, and let them smite thee," I should still repel my foe, the men who seized the town and (30) my god, the despoilers of my father, (yea) I would repel them.

I have heard the words which the king wrote to me, and who am I that the king should lose his land (10) because of me? Behold, I am a faithful servant of the king, and I have not rebelled and I have not sinned, and I do not withhold my tribute, and I do not refuse (15) the requests of my commissioner. Now they wickedly slander me, but let the king, my lord, not impute rebellion to me! Further, (20) my crime is namely that I entered Gezer and said publicly: (25) "Shall the king take my property, and not likewise the property of Milkilu ?" I know the deeds which Milkilu has done against me. (30) Further, the king wrote concerning my son. I did not know that my son associates with the 'Apiru (36), and I have verily delivered him into the hand of Addaya.
9 This letter is written in almost pure Canaanite and was not understood until very recently; for a detailed commentary on it see BASOR, No. 89, pp. 29-32. Lab'ayu virtuously protests that he was only repelling aggressors who had attacked his native town (not Shechem, which was his capital) in spite of a previous treaty sworn in the presence of an Egyptian official. 10 In this letter Lab'ayu protests his innocence of all charges against him and assures the king (Amen-hotep III) that he is more loyal than the neighbors who complain against him.
Further, if the king should write for my wife, (40) how could I withhold her ? If the king should write to me, "Plunge a bronze dagger into thy heart and (45) die!", how could I refuse to carry out the command of the king? EA, No. 25611

Behold, he has not been (here) for two months(?). (15) Indeed, ask Ben-ilima, ask Taduwa, ask Yashuya. Again, at the instance of (20) the house of Shulum-Marduk, the city of Ashtartu came to (my) help, when all the cities of the land of Garu were hostile, (namely) Udumu, Aduru, (25) Araru, Meshqu, Magdalu, Eni-anabu and Zarqu, and when Hayanu and Yabilima were captured.

11 For a detailed interpretation of this letter see BASOR, No. 89, pp. 7-15. Mut-ba'lu (literally "Man of Baal") was prince of Pella in the northern Jordan Valley, opposite Beth-Shan; Ayab (Ayyab, Hebrew Job) was prince of Ashtartu (biblical Ashtaroth) in Bashan. The land of Garu lay in southern Golan between Pella and Ashtartu. Yanhamu, to whom the letter is addressed, was a high Egyptian official of Canaanite (possibly of Hebrew) origin, who seems to have been the Egyptian governor of Palestine at the beginning of the reign of Akh-en-Aton. 12 Mittulu (Heb. Malchiel) was prince of Gezer. For Yanhamu see the previous letter. 18 For Milkilu see the previous letter. Shuwardata (with an Indo-Aryan name) was prince of the Hebron region in the southern hill-country, and frequently appears in association with Milkilu. The 'Apiru (formerly called Habiru) were a strong semi-nomadic people, or rather class of population in Syria and Palestine. While there is much reason to identify them with the Hebrews of the Patriarchal Age, the combination still remains uncertain and cannot be made the basis for any historical inferences.

Total: 40 concubines: the price of each concubine is 40 (shekels) of silver. (15) So send very fine concubines in whom there is no blemish. (19) And let the king, thy lord, say to thee, "This is good. To thee life has been decreed." And mayest thou know that (25) the king is well, like the Sun-god. His troops, his chariots, his horses are very well. Behold, the god Amon has placed the upper land, (30) the lower land, the rising of the sun, and the setting of the sun under the two feet of the king.

Further, (25) let the king, my lord, investigate; if I have taken a man or a single ox or an ass from him, then he is in the right!

u T h i s letter from pharaoh to Milkilu of Gezer throws an interesting light on the role of the Canaanite princes in organizing royal commerce in Asia; Egyptian products and manufactured articles are to be exchanged for the best quality of slave-girls. 15 Shuwardata, prince of the Hebron district (cf. n.13) here protests to pharaoh (Akh-en-Aton) that 'Abdu-Heba, prince of Jerusalem, is just as aggressive as the unlamented Lab'ayu (see die previous letters). 18 This letter, from the beginning of Akh-en-Aton's reign, is an extraordinarily illuminating illustration of the situation in Palestine at that time. Just who this redoubtable 'Apiru chieftain was we do not learn, since the proud feudal princes disdained even to mention names of the semi-nomadic 'Apiru. However, he was sufficiently dangerous to unite the arch-foes, 'Abdu-Heba and Shuwardata, and to induce them to offer fifty chariots (a very considerable offer for Palestinian chieftains) to the princes of Accho

Also let the king, my lord, know that all my brethren have abandoned me, and (20) it is I and 'Abdu-Heba (who) fight against the chief of the 'Apiru. And Zurata, prince of Accho, and Indaruta, prince of Achshaph, it was they (who) hastened (25) with fifty chariots—for I had been robbed (by the 'Apiru)—to my help; but behold, they are fighting against me, so let it be agreeable to the king, my lord, and (30) let him send Yanhamu, and let us make war in earnest, and let the lands of the king, my lord, be restored to their (former) limits!

To the king, my lord, say: Thus 'Abdu-Heba, thy servant At the two feet of my lord, the king, seven times and seven times I fall. (5) What have I done to the king, my lord? They blame me before the king, my lord (saying): " 'Abdu-Heba has rebelled against the king, his lord." Behold, as for me, (it was) not my father (10) and not my mother (who) set me in this place; the arm of the mighty king brought me into the house of my father! Why should I commit (15) transgression against the king, my lord? As long as the king, my lord, lives, I will say to the commissioner of the king, my lord, "Why do ye favor the 'Apiru and oppose the governors?"—And thus (21) I am blamed in the presence of the king, my lord. Because it is said, "Lost are the lands of the king, my lord," thus am I blamed to the king, my lord!

But the hostility against me is strong, so I cannot enter into the presence of the king, my lord. So may it please the king (45) to send me garrison troops in order that I may enter and see the
and Achshaph (for whom see notes 3 and 6) in the Plain of Acre, far to the north. One suspects that Milkilu of Gezer and Lab'ayu of Shechem, who are not mentioned at all, were—either or both—involved with the 'Apiru. 17 This lettter is characteristic of the continuous requests of 'Abdu-Heba, prince of Jerusalem, for Egyptian assistance in his chronic struggle with the 'Apiru. However, it seems certain from other letters that he was inclined to lump his enemies among the "governors" (Le. the native princes) with the 'Apiru. It is uncertain whether the Ilimilku. (Elimelech) of lines 35 ff. was an 'Apiru chieftain, was one of the sons of Lab'ayu, or was even Milkilu of Gezer (whose name might have been transposed accidentally by the scribe).

18 In this letter the prince of Jerusalem complains about a number of events which recur in other letters. In the first place he excoriates Milkilu of Gezer and Tagu of the northern Coastal Plain of Palestine for their aggression against Rubutu, which lay somewhere in the region southwest of Megiddo and Taanach. In the second place he urges the king to instruct his officers to supply the Egyptian archers from the towns of the Philistine Plain and Sharon (in order to avert heavy drain on the scanty supplies of Jerusalem). He goes on to complain that the Nubian (biblical Cushite) slave-troops (or mercenaries) of Egypt, stationed as garrison in Jerusalem, had burglarized the residence of 'Abdu-Heba himself, nearly killing the prince in his own house. He finally complains that his last caravan containing tribute and captives for the king was attacked and robbed near Ajalon, presumably by the men of Milkilu of Gezer and the sons of Lab'ayu.

Maya was a high Egyptian official at the court of the latter, then acting as commander of the Egyptian forces in Palestine. Peya bears an Egyptian name, in spite of the Canaanite name of his mother(?), and he was probably a minor Egyptian officer.

how many days he plundered it, so that it has become an empty cauldron because of him. From the mountains (50) people are ransomed for diirty (shekels) of silver, but from Peya for one hundred (shekels) of silver; so know these words of thy servant!

To the king, my lord, my pantheon, my Sim-god, say: Thus Yapahu, thy servant, the dirt (under) rhy two feet.

To the king, my lord, my pantheon, my Sun-god, the Sun-god of heaven. Thus Yapahu, the prince of (5) Gezer, the dirt (under) thy two feet, the groom of thy horse. At the two feet of the king, my lord (10) the Sun-god of heaven, seven dmes and seven times I fall, both prone and supine; and everything (15) which the king, my lord, commands me I hear very attentively. A servant of the king am I, and the dirt of thy two feet. (20) Let the king my lord know that my youngest brother is estranged from me, and has entered (25) Muhhazu, and has given his two hands to the chief of the 'Apiru. And now the [land of . . . ]anna is hostile to me. (30) Have concern for thy land! Let my lord write to his commissioner concerning this deed.

To the king, my lord, my pantheon, my Sun-god, the Sun-god of heaven: Thus (5) Widia, the prince of Ashkelon, thy servant, the dirt (under) thy feet, the groom of thy horse. (10) At the feet of the king, my lord, seven times and seven times verily I fall, both prone and (15) supine. Now I am guarding the place of the king which is with me, and whatever the king, my lord, has sent to me (20) I have heard very attentively. Who is the dog that does not hearken to the words of the king, his lord, (25) the son of the Sun-god ?
28 Yapakhu was prince of Gezer after the death of Milkilu. By Sutu is meant the nomadic tribesmen of Semitic origin who were in Egyptian service, as we know from other documents. 24 cf. the preceding note. 25 Note the Indo-Aryan name of the prince of Ashkelon, whose servile words illustrate the impotence to which he was condemned by his nearness to the Egyptian residence at Gaza, as well as by the smallness of his territory.

Letter from Tell el-Hesi28
[To] the (Egyptian) officer say: [Thus PJa'pu. At thy feet I fall. Thou shouldst know that (5) Shipti-ba'lu and Zimreda have plotted publicly and Shipti-ba'lu said to Zimreda: ["The pr]ince of Yaramu wrote to me: 'Give me rsix"! bows, and three daggers, and three swords. (15) Verily I am going out against the land of the king, and thou art my ally!'" And yet he returns (the charge of) (20) lese-majeste (saying): "The one who plots against the king is Pa'pu!

Thou hast written to me concerning silver (10) and behold I will give fifty (shekels) of silver, truly I will do (so)! Further, and if (20) there is a wizard of Asherah, let him tell our fortunes and let me hear quickly, and the omen and the interpretation send to me. (25) As for thy daughter who is in the town of Rubutu, let me know concerning her welfafe; and if she grows up thou shalt give her to become a singer, (30) or to a husband.
26 For this letter and its interpretation see BASOR, No. 87, pp. 32-38. It vividly characterizes the atmosphere of mutual suspicion and treachery which prevailed in Palestine in the early part of Akh-en-Aton's reign. Zimreda was prince of Lachish (Tell cd-Du weir) and Shipti-Ba'lu was to succeed him in that capacity. As shown by his name, Pa'pu was an Egyptian official, perhaps the local commissioner at Lachish. 27 For die interpretation of this letter see BASOR, N o . 86, pp. 28-31. T h e letter was published by F. M. T h . Böhl, ZDPV, XLIX, pp. 321-27. The name Birashshena is Indo-Aryan. 28 For a detailed study of this letter and the other letters found by Ernst Sellin at Taanach, five miles southeast of Megiddo in northern Palestine, see W. F. Albright, BASOR, No. 94, pp. 12-27. T h e tablets were first published, with some photographs, by F. Hroznf in Tell Tdanne\ (Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil.-hist. Klasse, l, Vienna, 1904, Part i v ) , pp. 113 ff., and in Eine Nachlese auf dem Teil Tafannek. in Palästina (Denkschriften, l i i , 1906, Part m ) , pp. 36 ff. They unquestionably belong to the fifteenth century B.C., and they may be dated roughly about three generations before the bulk of the Amarna Tablets. Rewashsha was prince of Taanach; his Egyptian name illustrates the extent of Egyptian penetration about a century after the initial conquest. The word here rendered "wizard" is Akkadian ummanu, which passed into Hebrew as omman and into later Phoenician as ammun, always with the general sense of "learned, skilled man, expert." T h e diviners of Asherah appear in the time of Elijah (I Kings 18:19 ff.) as "prophets of Asherah": they also figure in the Baal Epic of Ugarit

SETTLEMENT OF CLAIM BY OATH
Text: Sayce-Cowley, F; Cowley, 14. Date: 440 B.C. The Jewess Mibtahiah (Mbthyh) had apparendy married the Egyptian Pi' and then the marriage had been dissolved. The marriage had meant Mibtahiah's exit from the Jewish community and adoption into the Egyptian. Even its liquidation necessitated her swearing by an Egyptian deity. The witnesses to this document are neither Jewish nor Egyptian.
On the 14th of Ab, being the 19th day of Pahons, in the year 25 of King Artaxerxes, Pi' the son of Pahi (Phy), builder, of the fortress of Syene, said to Mibtahiah, daughter of Mahseiah the son of Yedoniah, an Aramean of Syene of the detachment of Varizata (as follows): In accordance with the action which we took at Syene, let us make a division of the silver, grain, raiment, bronze, iron, and all goods and possessions and marriage contract. Then an oath was imposed upon you, and you swore to me concerning them by the goddess Sati. I was satisfied with the oath which you took to me concerning your goods, and I renounce all claim on you from this day for ever.

Ungnad, 1; Cowley 30. Date: 407 B.C. (Another, defective copy, with some variants: Sachau, 3; Ungnad, 2; Cowley 31.)
To our lord Bagoas, governor of Judah, your servants Yedoniah and his colleagues, the priests who are in the fortress of Elephantine. May the God of Heaven seek after the welfare of our lord exceedingly at all times and give you favor before King Darius and the nobles a thousand times more than now. May you be happy and healthy at all times. Now, your servant Yedoniah and his colleagues depose as follows: In the month of Tammuz in the 14th year of King Darius,12 when Arsames (5) departed and went to the king, the priests of the god Khnub, who is in the fortress of Elephantine, conspired with Vidaranag, who was commander-inchief here, to wipe out the temple of the god Yaho from the fortress of Elephantine. So that wretch Vidaranag sent to his son Nefayan, who was in command of the garrison of the fortress of Syene, this order, "The temple of the god Yaho in the fortress of Yeb is to be destroyed." Nefayan thereupon led the Egyptians with the other troops. Coming with their weapons to the fortress of Elephantine, they entered that temple and razed it to the ground. The stone pillars that were there they smashed. Five (10) "great"13 gateways built with hewn blocks of stone which were in that temple they demolished, but their doors are standing, and the hinges of those doors are of bronze; and their roof of cedarwood, all of it, with t h e . . . and whatever else was there, everything they burnt with fire. As for the basins of gold and silver and other articles that were in that temple, they carried all of them off and made them their own.—Now, our forefathers built this temple in the fortress of Elephantine back in the days of the kingdom of Egypt, and when Cambyses came to Egypt he found it built. They knocked down all the temples of the gods of Egypt, but no one did any damage to this temple. (15) But when this happened, we and our wives and our children wore sackcloth, and fasted, and prayed to Yaho the Lord of Heaven, who has let us see our desire upon that Vidaranag. The dogs took the fetter out of his feet,14 and any property he had gained was lost; and any men who have sought to do evil to this temple have all been killed and we have seen our desire upon them.—We have also sent a letter before now, when this evil was done to us, (to) our lord and to the high priest Johanan15 and his colleagues the priests in Jerusalem and to Ostanes the brother of Anani16 and the nobles of the Jews. Never a letter have they sent to us. Also, from the month of Tammuz, year 14 of King Darius, (20) to this day, we have been wearing sackcloth and fasting, making our wives as widows, not anointing ourselves with oil or drinking wine. Also, from then to now, in the year 17 of King Darius,17 no meal-offering, in[cen]se, nor burnt offering

have been offered in this temple. Now your servants Yedoniah, and his colleagues, and the Jews, the citizens of Elephantine, all say thus: If it please our lord, take thought of this temple to rebuild it, since they do not let us rebuild it Look to your well-wishers and friends here in Egypt Let a letter be sent from you to them concerning die temple of the god Yaho (25) to build it in the fortress of Elephantine as it was built before; and the meal-offering, incense, and burnt offering will be offered in your name, and we shall pray for you at all times, we, and our wives, and our children, and the Jews who are here, all of them, if you do thus, so that that temple is rebuilt. And you shall have a merit before Yaho the God of Heaven more than a man who offers to him burnt offering and sacrifices worth a thousand talents of silver and (because of)18 gold. Because of this we have written to inform you. We have also set the whole matter forth in a letter in our name to Delaiah and Shelemiah, the sons of Sanballat the governor of Samaria.19 (30) Also, Arsames knew nothing of all that was done to us. On the 20th of Marheshwan, year 17 of King Darius.

PETITION BY ELEPHANTINE JEWS, PERHAPS TO ARSAMES Text: Sachau, 4; Ungnad, 4; Cowley, 33.

18 Erroneous anticipation of the following "because of." cf. also M. Vogelstein, JQR, xxxin (1942), 89-92. 19 The well-known contemporary of Nehemiah. 20 The Mazdean Arsames was likely to react more favorably if no mention was made of burnt offering, since it involved the profaning of fire by contact with dead bodies. 21 See preceding note.



X. Miscellaneous Texts






Egyptian Texts
TRANSLATOR: JOHN A. WILSON
The Authority
of Ancient Documents
The Egyptians had a strong sense of past dignity and accomplishment, so that they constandy invoked the authority of previous times in order to give sanction to the present. In literature of various kinds, a frequent statement emphasized the fidelity of the present copy to an older model.1 A common case lay in the medical papyri, in which the prescriptions were given authority through the claim that there had been discovered an old document which went back to the days of Egypt's first dynasties, and which was also related to the gods or the temples. Thus an anatomical treatise in the Ebers medical papyrus was emphasized as:
BEING WHAT WAS FOUND IN WRITING UNDER THE FEET of Anubis IN LETOPOLIS. IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE
MAJESTY OF THE KLNG OF UPPER AND LOWER EGYPT:
Usaphais, the triumphant.2
Similarly a section in the Berlin Medical Papyrus:
which was found among old writings in a box containing documents under the feet of Anubis in Letopolis in the time of (King) Usaphais... It was brought to the majesty of (King) Senedj, because of its efficacy.3
It was comforting to a man suffering from the itch to know that the prescription for his ailment had been "found during an inventory in the Temple of Wen-nofer," that is, Osiris.4 That has a matter-of-fact sound, but sometimes the claim bore a miraculous character, as in a remedy credited to the goddess Isis:
This remedy was found in the night, fallen into the court of the temple in Koptos, as a mystery of this goddess, by a lector-priest of this temple, when this land was in darkness, and it was the moon which shone upon every side of this scroll. It was brought as a marvel to the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Khufu, the triumphant.5

For the recopying of an older text, see the Memphite Theology on p. 4 above. For pious forgeries, cast back into the past, see the discussions of the two legends on pp. 29 and 31.

T h e manuscript dates from the early 18th dynasty (16th century B . C . ) , while Usaphais was a king of the 1st dynasty (perhaps 3ist-2<)th century B . C . ) .

T h e Interpretation of Dreams
A recendy discovered hieratic papyrus gives a reference book for the interpretation of dreams. A few examples—out of more than two hundred—will show the nature of these interpretations. Very commonly the principle of similars is used, either similars of sound, that is, puns, or similars of situation, like the dreams which Joseph interpreted* (See Addenda). The physical arrangement of the text is distinctive. The words, "if a man see himself in a dream," are written once for each column of various dreams. Set in a column over against each dream is the word "good" or the word "BAD" (written in red), followed by the meaning of the dream. The manuscript presumably comes from Thebes, and is dated to the Nineteenth Dynasty (about 1300 B.C.), although the editor cites evidence that its material may derive from the Twelfth Dynasty (2000-1800 B.C.). Papyrus Chester Beatty III, now British Museum 10683, extracts from recto, i-xi. Published in Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Third Series. Chester Beatty Gift, ed. by A. H. Gardiner (London, 1935), 1, 9-23; Pis. 5-8.
If a man see himself in a dream:
(iii 4) white bread being good: it means things at given to him— which his face will light up.1
(iv 3) seeing a large cat— good: it means a large harvest will come [to him.]2
(v 19) plunging into the good: it means cleansing river— from all evils.
(22) [seeing the] moon as good: forgiveness to him it shines— by his god.
(vii 11) seeing his face in BAD: it means another a mirror— wife.3
(13) seeing himself with a BAD: taking something apain in his side— way from him.
(28) seeing the catching of BAD: it means taking away birds— his property.4
(viii 5) looking into a deep BAD: putting him into priswell— on.
For an indication that the Egyptians divined through an observation of the stars and the winds, see p. 377 above.
1 Pun: hedj "white," and hedj "light up." 2 Pun: miu 'aa "large cat," and shemu 'aa "large harvest." 3 Gardiner, the editor of the text, explains: "to see one's face in a mirror is to discover a second self, which second self must naturally have a wife." Why this is "bad" is not clear. 4 Pun: ham "catching," and nehem "taking away."



Sumerian Love-Song
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Love-Song to a King
This little poem seems to be a love-song dedicated to Shu-Sin, the fourth ruler of the Third Dynasty of Ur, who reigned sometime about 2000 B.C. It was probably composed by a woman1 who belonged to the priestly order known as lufyur by the Sumerians and natitu2 by the Akkadians. Only one tablet inscribed with the poem has as yet been found; it was excavated in Nippur and dates from the first half of the second millennium B.C. Its text was copied and published by Edward Chiera as No. 23 of his Sumerian Religious Texts (1924). Only recendy a scientific edition of the composition, including transliteration, translation, and commentary, was published by A. Falkenstein in Die Welt Des Orients (1947), 43-50.
'She gave birth to him who is pure, she gave birth to him who is pure, The queen gave birth to him who is pure, Abisimti4 gave birth to him who is pure, The queen gave birth to him who is pure. O my (queen) who is favored of limb, my Abisimti, O my (queen) who i s . . . d of head, my queen Dabbatum,5 O my (lord) who is . . . d of hair, my lord Shu-Sin,"
1 The poem is written in the Emesal dialect of Sumerian, which is known to have been reserved for female deities, and no doubt also for priestesses. 2 Practically nothing is known of the specific duties of this priesdy class, but cf. n.4 below. * By and large our poem seems to consist of a number of four-line strophes, thus: lines 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, i 5 ( ? ) - i 8 ( ? ) , 19-22, and 23-26(?); difficult to fit in are lines 13-14 and line 27. The logical relationship between the various strophes, however, is not too clear. Thus the first strophe sings of the birth of Shu-Sin by Abisimti; the second strophe seems to contain exclamatory lines exalting Shu-Sin, his mother Abisimti, and perhaps his wife Dabbatum; in the third strophe the poet-priestess sings of the gifts presented her by Shu-Sin. The six partially destroyed lines which follow seem to contain a two-line plea to Shu-Sin and four exclamatory lines exalting the king. In the next four-line strophe the poetess probably sings temptingly of strong drink and sexual love. The last lines again seem to be exclamatory in character and leave one with the feeling that the poem is incomplete, unless perhaps we are to understand that die strophe contained in lines 19-22 was intended to be repeated after line 27.
4 Since "him who is pure" refers to Shu-Sin, our poem provides us with the name of King Shu-Sin's mother and of King Shulgi's wife (or, rather one of his wives); cf. n.7 below. B Dabbatum who is addressed in this line by the poetess as "my queen," is probably the name of a /«^«r-priestess who may have become one of Shu-Sin's wives. In the excavations carried on in Erech before the war, there was found a precious necklace one of whose beads was inscribed with the words "Dabbatum, the lul(ur-priestess of Shu-Sin"; cf. Falkenstein's interesting comment, and particularly his suggestion that one of the duties of the lul(ur-priestess was to participate in a hieros-gamos with the divine king, as representative of the goddess whom she served (Joe. cit., pp. 46 and 50). 6 The king's name is preceded by the god-determinative throughout the poem.
O my (lord) who is . . . of word, my son of Shulgi!1 Because I uttered it, because I uttered it,, the lord gave me a gift, Because I uttered a cry of joy, the lord gave me a gift, (10) A pendant of gold, a seal of lapis lazuli, the lord gave me as a gift, A ring of gold, a ring of silver, the lord gave me as a gift. O lord, thy gift is brimful of . . . , [lift] thy face8 [unto me], O Shu-Sin, thy gift is brimful o f . . . , [lift] thy face unto me." . . . [l]ord... [l]ord . . . , . . . like a weapon ...,
Thy city [lift]s its hand like a cripple, O my lord ShuSin, It lies at thy feet like a lion-cub, O son of Shulgi.10 O my god, of the wine-maid,11 sweet is her date wine, Like her date wine sweet is her vulva, sweet is her date wine, (20) Like her .. ,12 sweet is her vulva, sweet is her date wine, Sweet is her diluted drinks her date wine. O my Shu-Sin who hast favored me, O my (Shu-Sin) who hast favored me, who hast fondled me, O my Shu-Sin who hast favored me, O my beloved of Enlil, (my) Shu-Sin, O my king, the god of his18 land! It is a bedbde of Bau.14

7 The poem provides us with the significant information that, in spite of the Sumerian King List, Shu-Sin, the fourth king of the Third Dynasty of Ur, is not the son of Bur-Sin, bis immediate predecessor, but his brother, and that both Bur-Sin and Shu-Sin are the sons of Shulgi; cL Falkenstein, loc. cit., p. 45.
8 Perhaps "eye" instead of "face" in this and the next line. 9 The punctuation assumes that lines 13-14 form a couplet and that lines 15-18 contain another four-line strophe; cf. n.3 above. 10 The text does not have the expected " m y " before "son of Shulgi." 11 Falkenstein may be right in suggesting that the "wine-maid" refers to the priestess herself. 18 The first two signs are hardly to be read (with Falkenstein) dun(g)dun(g), since the third sign would then in all likelihood have been CA, not A; tor a similar reason they are hardly to be read mim-inim "words." Perhaps they are to be read sun-suu "teeth," though the context seems to ask for a word such as "lips." 18 "His" instead of the expected "thy." 14 For balbde as a technical term for a specific type of Sumerian composition, cf. p. 42 of this volume. As for the phrase "of Bau," it may imply that the priestess who composed this poem was in the service of the goddess Bau (also pronounced Baba, cf. p. 456 of this volume); for additional details, cf. Falkenstein, loc. cit., pp. 48-50.

SUPPLEMENT TO
Ancient Near Eastern Texts






Akkadian Myths and Epics
TRANSLATOR: A. K. GRAYSON
Since the second edition of this volume was published there has been considerable improvement in our knowledge of Akkadian myths and epics. This improvement is due in part to continuing study of the texts already known and in part to new texts which have come to light. It is unfortunate that, due to his untimely death, Professor E. A. Speiser was unable to undertake the revision of his translations. The present writer, in assuming this task, has tried to follow Speiser's style as much as possible. Thus no changes have been made in the previously published translations unless these were made necessary by recent research or newly discovered texts. The translations of passages which are still not clear have been left unaltered. All publications which have appeared in the intervening years have been taken into consideration with the exception of the abundant material now being made available for the Atrahasis Epic, an omission which will be explained in the section on that composition. One completely new text, A Babylonian Theogony, has been included.
T h e Creation Epic
ADDITIONS TO TABLETS V-VII
Research and new discoveries have filled some gaps in this composition and corrected some erroneous ideas. It is now widely held that the date of composition of the Creation Epic is later than the Old Babylonian period. Beyond this there is little agreement for while some would place its origin in the Kassite period, others would date it even later. Among recent publications of overall significance must be included the composite cuneiform text of the epic edited by W. G. Lambert and Simon B. Parker, Enuma Etis (Oxford, 1966). Also worthy of note is an article by W. G. Lambert, "A New Look at the Babylonian Background of Genesis" in The Journal of Theological Studies, xvi (1965), 287-300. New texts that have appeared come mainly from Ashur and Sultantepe. In the second edition of this volume Speiser was able to incorporate the Ashur material into the translations. The Sultantepe texts had only just begun to appear, however, and he was able to utilize very little of them. Thus most of the changes made in the translation have been occasioned by the Sultantepe material.1
Since Tablets I-IV were previously well preserved only small changes were necessary. All of these changes have been incorporated in the body of die text. The new sources are:
Tablet I: E. Ebeling, LKA, No. 3. O. R. Gurney and J. J. Finkelstein, STT, I, No. 1. For the Sultantepe text also see O. R. Gurney, AnSt, 11 (1952), 32 f. Tablet II: LKA, Nos. 4 and 5. STT, I, No. 2. Tablet III: No new texts. Tablet IV: LKA, No. 6. STT, I, Nos. 3-8. STT, II, No. 115 (joins STT, I, No.
1 For a summary of the Sultantepe sources for the Creation Epic see 0. R. Gurney, AfO, x v n ( 1 9 5 6 ) , 353-56.
8). On the Sultantepe material also see O. R. Gurney, AnSt, 11 (1952), 27 f.
A few changes have been made in the translation of Tablet IV which require comment. In line 19 the correct translation is "Images," Akkadian lu-ma-sd as shown by STT, I, No. 3 and see R. Borger, AfO, xix (1959-60), 113. This constellation, which is also mentioned in IV, 23-26 and in Tablet V, has been discussed by B. Landsberger and Kinnier Wilson, JNES, xx (1961), 170-71. At the beginning of IV, 53 read with STT, I, No. 3: pa-tu-nu sap-ti. At the beginning of IV, 54 read with STT, I, No. 3: a-na-ha la i-du-u.
Tablet V
The major addition to our knowledge of the epic is in Tablet V. A large portion of the text was published many years ago by L. W . King, CT, XIII, 22-25, but its identity as part of Tablet V was disputed. The recent discovery at Sultantepe of a duplicate, STT, I, No. 12, has virtually settled the argument. The sources for Tablet V were recently compiled, edited, and commented upon by B. Landsberger and J. V. Kinnier Wilson, JNES, xx (1961), 154-179. Some changes have been made in the first twenty-two lines of this tablet translated by Speiser. There follows what can be translated of the remainder of the tablet using the line numbering of the Landsberger and Kinnier Wilson edition.
"I [have appointed] a sign, follow its path, (23) . . . [ . . . a]pproach and give judgement."
(Lines 25-44 are too broken for translation. It is clear from the traces, however, that after completing his creation of the moon Marduk turned his attention to establishing the sun.)
After he [had appointed] the days [to Shamash], (45)
[And had established] the precincts of night and
d[ay],
[Taking] the spittle of Tiafmat] Marduk created [ . . . ] . . . He formed the c[louds] and filled (them) with [water].
The raising of winds, the bringing of rain (and) (50) cold, Making the mist smoke, piling up her2 poison: (These) he appointed to himself, took into his own charge.

passage the seating of Marduk on the throne with his
weapons was described.)

When they had given the sovereignty to Marduk, They declared for him a formula of good fortune an< success: "Henceforth thou wilt be the patron of our sanctuarie; Whatever thou dost command we will do." Marduk opened his mouth to speak, To say a word to the gods, his fathers: "Above the Apsu where you have resided, The counterpart of Esharra which I have built (120 over you, Below I have hardened the ground for a building site, I will build a house, it will be my luxurious abode. I will found therein its temple, I will appoint cellas, I will establish my sovereignty. When you come up from the Apsu for assembly, You will spend the night therein, (it is there) to

Tablet VI
The new texts are: LKA, No. 7. STT, I, No. 9 (cf. O. R. Gurney, AnSt, 11 (1952), 33 £.). All of the new material has been incorporated in the body of the former translation with the exception of lines 91-104 which are translated below.
He fixed its7 position with the gods its brothers. (91) After Anu had decreed the fate of the bow, (And) had placed the lofty royal throne before the gods, Anu placed it8 in the Assembly of the gods. When the great gods had assembled, They extolled the destiny of Marduk, they bowed down, They pronounced among themselves a curse, Swearing by water and oil to place life in jeopardy." When they had granted him the exercise of kingship of the gods,
When they had given him dominion over the gods (100) of heaven and underworld, Anshar pronounced supreme his name, Asarluhi (saying):
"Let us do obeisance at the mention of his name, To his utterance let the gods give heed, Let his command be supreme above and below!"
Tablet VII
Our knowledge of this tablet has considerably improved thanks to the new texts: LKA, No. 8. STT, I, Nos. 10 and 11. All of the additions and changes have been incorporated in the body of the former translation with the exception of the last few lines (158-62) of the epilogue which are now adequately preserved to deserve translation here.

The Epic of Gilgamesh
ADDITIONS TO TABLETS V-VIII AND X
Research and new finds have continued to increase our knowledge of the Epic of Gilgamesh. The recent discovery of a fragment of this epic at Megiddo in Palestine10 provides yet another indication of the diffusion of this popular composition and the appearance at Bogazkoy of further pieces of die Hurrian and Hittite versions11 is also of interest in this respect. In recent years there have been significant additions to the Old Babylonian version as well as to the late recension of the epic. Bibliographical details of the new material will be given at the appropriate place. Here only new and significant studies of the work as a whole will be noted. Of particular importance is a revision of Schott's translation of the epic into German published by W. von Soden, Das Gilgamesch-Epos (1958) as well as von Soden's notes to this new edition in ZA, L I I I (1959), 209-35. Also noteworthy is the revised edition of A. Heidel's, The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels (1949). An indication that interest in this literary composition is far from waning is the fact that the VII Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale held in 1958 was devoted to a discussion of the Gilgamesh Epic and the numerous and varied papers presented at that time were subsequently edited and published by P. Garelli, Gilgames et sa LSgende (i960). In particular note the detailed bibliography compiled by L. de Meyer on pp. 1-30.
Tablet I
Sources for Tablet I have been slightly increased by the recent publication of four Neo-Babylonian fragments by W. G. Lambert, CT, XLVI, 17-20. CT, XLvi, 17 and part of CT, XLVI, 19 were utilized by Thompson in GETh but were not previously published in full. CT, XLVI, 18 and 20 were first published by D. J. Wiseman in Garelli, Gilgames et sa LSgende, 126 and 124 respectively. Most changes and additions necessitated by the new pieces have been incorporated in the revised pages of the translation. In I ii 7 one may now read:
In the rampart of Uruk he [. . . ]
To footnote 8 on p. 73 (note to I ii 10) add: The interpretation of this line and its parallel, I ii 22, is still a crux. The suggestion of B. Landsberger, WZKM, LVI (i960), 125, n. 49 to read ina puqqisu tebu ru'usu "His companions stand (read/), waiting for his command" is possible for I ii 10 (note that i-na pu-uqqt-su is preserved in CT, XLVI, 19) but not for I ii 22 where the text reads: ina pu~u\-\i su-ut-bu-u [. . .].
In Bi.Or., x v m (1961), 62,1. M. Diakonoff has suggested that the designation of the harlot as samhatu is in fact a personal name. This suggestion does not take into account the fact that the plural of samhatu occurs in Tablet VI 164 as a synonymous parallel to harimati. Speiser's translation of samhatu as "the lass" has therefore been maintained.
Tablet II
OLD BABYLONIAN VERSION
Some changes in the translation have been made in accordance with the suggestions of W . von Soden, ZA, LIII (1959), 210-12.
Tablet III

A few changes have been made in the translation and these have been justified in the footnotes. On iii 24 and v 19 see E. A. Speiser, JCS, xu (1958), 41 £

Tablet IV
The obverse of two Neo-Babylonian fragments published by W . G. Lambert, CT, XLVI, 21 and 22, has added slighdy to our knowledge of this tablet C T , XLVI, 22 was previously published by D. J. Wiseman in Garelli, Gilgames et sa Ugende, 124. T h e few minor changes have been incorporated in the body of the translation.
Tablet V
OLD BABYLONIAN VERSION
Our knowledge of Tablet V has been increased by the discovery of three Old Babylonian fragments which will be called A, B, and C. One of these ( A ) , which was unearthed at Tell Harmal, is in such a terrible state of preservation that there would be no point in reproducing here the disconnected words and phrases that can be deciphered. It appears, however, that it describes the arrival of Gilgamesh and Enkidu at the cedar forest which is dealt with at the beginning of Tablet V in the late version. The text was published by J. J. A. van Dijk, Sumer, xv (1959), 9-10 and Plates 3-4.
B
The second Old Babylonian fragment also comes from Tell Harmal and contains a fragmentary account of a dream which is similar in some respects to the dream described in V, 7-19. It is also reminiscent of the tale of the Bull of Heaven described in Tablet VI since a fight with a wild bull is narrated in the account of the dream. When the text begins someone, apparently Gilgamesh, is describing a dream to his companion, presumably Enkidu. TTic tablet was published by J. J. A. van Dijk, Sumer, XIII (1957), 66 and 91. Further see van Dijk, Sumer, xiv (1958), 114-21 and von Soden, ZA, LUI (1959), 215-19.
"Arise and look towardi" the mountain [. . . ]! I am robbed of (my) divine sleep. My friend, I saw a dream—Oh how18 unfavorable how . . . , how disturbing! I seized a wild bull16 of the steppe, Bellowing he l{ic\ed up the earth, the dust darkened the sky. I gave way16 before him. He was seizing [. . . ] strength, my flank, He tore out the . . . [ . . . ] . . . He provided food . . . [ . . . he] drank, [he] gave me [to dr]ink from his water-skin."
(The description of the dream ends and someone else,
presumably Enkidu, now explains it.)
"The god, my friend, to whom we go, (10)
Is not a wild bull (although) his form is strange.
The wild bull which thou didst see is radiant Shamash,
In distress he will grasp our hands.
The one who gave thee to drink from his water-skin,
He is thy god who brings thee honor.
12 a-na fu-ri-im has been taken as a synonym of ana libbim although
surrutn in this meaning is otherwise not attested in Old Babylonian. Cf.
CAD, xvi (§), 259 f. Van Dijk's assurrim ( ana surrim "soudainement"
gives poor sense. Von Soden translated "Fete." 1 3 Read \[i with von Soden, ZA, L I I I (1959), 216.
1 4 Perhaps read: la(-ap)-ta-at with von Soden, ibid.
1BHere the word is plural but otherwise in this text it is angular.
1 6 Perhaps read: \a\l-tu-ud with von Soden, ibid.
We should (therefore) join (with him), Lugalbanda,1T That we might do one thing, a deed which will not be made ignominious through death!"18
The third Old Babylonian fragment was discovered at Tell Is£afi and published by T. Bauer, JNES, xvi (1957), 254-262. It contains an account of the killing of Huwawa:
(obverse)
(The first eight lines are too fragmentary for translation.)
[Gilgamesh said t]o Enkidu:
" W e will arrive19 in . . . [ . . . ], (10) The radiant beams80 will vanish in the confusion, The radiant beams will vanish and the brilliance become clouded." Enkidu said to Gilgamesh: "My friend, (first) catch the bird. Then where will the young birds go? Let us, (therefore), seek the radiant beams later, (For) like young birds they will run about in the grass. Kill him (Huwawa), then kill his servants!"
(reverse)
Gilgamesh heeded what his friend said. He took the axe in his hand, He drew the sword from his belt. Gilgamesh struck him (Huwawa) in the [nec]k, Enkidu, his friend, [. . . ] . . . , At the third (blow) [Huwawa] fell. Confusion [. . . du]mbfounded, [He struc]k the watchman, Huwawa, to the ground.

(The remainder of the speech is too fragmentary for translation.)
Tablet VI
Several Neo-Assyrian fragments which belong to this tablet and which are in the Museum of the Ancient Orient at Istanbul have recently come to light. These pieces were published and commented upon by R. Frankena in Garelli, Gilgames et sa Legende, 113-22. Most of the necessary changes and additions could be incorporated in the body of the translation. Note that in line 38 the translation "cuts" is based on the restoration mu-[na-\i\-sa-at. Cf. R. Frankena in Garelli, Gilgames et sa Legende, 120. When carried the water skin rubs and chafes the side. For line 40 see E. A. Speiser, JCS, xn (1958), 41 f. In line 89 instead of "Art thou the father?" one text has "Thou art not the father!" On bi-nam-ma "Please give" in line 94 cf. line 96 and W. G. Lambert, BWL, 324 and CAD, 11 (B), 216 f. There follows a translation of lines 117-131.

Tablet VII
Our knowledge of this tablet has been increased by the discovery at Sultantepe of a fragment which contains, in a very mutilated state, the remainder of the speech of Enkidu to the door. It was published by O. R. Gurney, JCS, vm (1954), 87-90 and the copy was reproduced as STT, I, No. 14. Also see Gurney's corrections in AnSt, vm (1958), 245. The Sultantepe fragment fits into the gap just before the beginning of column iii (p. 86). The latter part of the Sultantepe text is duplicated by die obverse of a Neo-Babylonian fragment recently published by W. G. Lambert, CT, XLVI, 23. This piece also contains the beginning of column iii thus providing the one line missing between the end

27 Variant: "two."
28 The Neo-Assyrian texts now provide the end of the next few lines
and show that Thompson in GETh was wrong in identifying K. 5335
(PI. 24) as containing the ends of these lines. Furthermore, Thompson
was wrong in assuming that two lines were missing between this and
the previous line. The remaining line numbers have been corrected
accordingly. To find the corresponding line in GETh amply add two. 29 \u-bur zib-ba-ti-iu, "thickness of his tail." It refers to the tassle at the end of the tail in contrast to the thin middle part (qutun
zibbati). See von Soden, ZA, LIII (1959), 226.
of the Sultantepe fragment and the beginning of column iii. These pieces prove that K. 3588, Sm. 2132, and Rm. 2, 399 which were published in GETh, Plates 14-16 belong to Tablet VII. Further fragments of this tablet were published by W. G. Lambert, CT, XLVI, 24-26. CT, XLVI, 24 shows that 79-7-8, 320 (published in GETh, Plate 27) contains part of column iv. See further Landsberger, WZKM, LVII (1961), 8, n. 38. Yet another recent addition to the sources for Tablet VII was made by the publication of a tablet from Ur by C. J. Gadd, UET, vi, No. 394 and edited by Gadd, Iraq, x x v m (1966), 105-21. This tablet, which is probably from the Middle Babylonian period, is in a very poor state of preservation. It varies somewhat in content from the late recension. It duplicates the end of column ii of the late recension, now known from the Sultantepe fragment, and column iii and the beginning of column iv. But due to its poor state of preservation and the fact that it is not an exact duplicate of the late recension, it can only be used in a few instances to improve our understanding of the text. Changes and additions necessitated by the new sources have been incorporated into the body of the translation with the exception of a few passages. The first, a translation of which follows, fits into the large gap just before the beginning of column iii (p. 86). The lines have been numbered according to the Sultantepe fragment.
(After several mutilated lines Enkidu's speech continues.) "Now, O door, it is I who made thee, it is I who raised [thee],30 (12a) [. . . ] . . . thee. May either a king who comes after me . . . thee, Or may a god [. . . ] . . . thee. Let him destroy my name and place his own name (thereon)."81 He ripped out [. . . ] . . . he tore down. While he was listening to his speech, with great haste his [ . . . ] ,

[Yet though g]reat are [the fears], the dream is precious: For the healthy they released misery; [The dre]am left the healthy with woe. [. . . ] and I will pray to the [great] gods."
(There is a gap of approximately eleven lines before the duplicate UET, vi, No. 394 makes the text legible again.)
When daylight came Enkidu lifted his head, weeping before Shamash, Before the radiance of Shamash his tears flow: "I pray to thee, Shamash, regarding the hunter, the rogue,

(Column iii i-io of the late recension follows immedi
ately.)
Column iii 9-10 of the late recension is identical with UET, vi, No. 394:13 f. and thus both lines are now fully preserved. After iii 10 of the late recension UET, vi, No. 394:15-27 has a text similar to but not always identical with iii 11-22. The relevant portion of UET, vi, No. 394 is therefore translated separately here.
Thou shalt not enter into the tavern of young women,
Thy lovely bosom . . .
The place of thy festivities may the drunkard defile with vomit,
... all the troops
(The next four lines are too fragmentary for translation.)
The dust of the potter's crossroad shall be thy dwelling
place,
The desert shall be thy bed,
The shadow of the wall shall be thy station,
[Tho]rn and bramble shall skin thy feet,
[The bes]otted and the thirsty shall smite thy cheek!
The next several lines of UET, vi, No. 394 (28-39) are too mutilated for translation but are apparently similar to the broken lines of the late recension, iii 23-32. UET, vi, No. 394: 40-46 contains the speech of Shamash to Enkidu (cf. iii 33-48) and presumably the introduction of Enkidu's speech to the harlot. UET, vi, No. 394:47-67 is parallel to (but not always identical with) the end of column iii and iv 1-20 of the late recension. Due to the mutilated state of preservation of this portion of UET, vi, No. 394 it has not been deemed worthwhile to list here the variants from the late recension. In the translation restorations have been made wherever possible from UET, vi, No. 394 and from CT, XLVI, 24.
Tablet VIII
The discovery of a fragment at Sultantepe has considerably
increased our knowledge of the beginning of this tablet. Unfor
tunately it is a tablet inscribed by a pupil who was in the process
of learning the scribal art and there are numerous errors. The
text was published by O. R. Gurney, JCS, vm (1954), 90-95 and
the copy was reproduced by Gurney as STT, I, No. 15. Concern
ing the errors in the text also see I. M. Diakonoff, Bi.Or., xvm
(1961), 64, n. 18. A tiny Neo-Babylonian fragment which dupli
cates a little of the Sultantepe text was recently published by
W . G. Lambert as CT, XLVI, 27. The obverse of the Sultantepe
fragment provides part of the missing first column of the
Ninevite version and immediately precedes the beginning of the
second column. The reverse of the Sultantepe text, allowing for
numerous errors and discrepancies, duplicates the second column
of the Ninevite version and adds a few more lines. The neces
sary changes have been made in the translation of column ii.
In the translation of the obverse of the Sultantepe text given
here, fragments of column i published in GETh have been
incorporated. Also translated are the four new lines that the
Sultantepe text provides for the end of column ii of the Ninevite
recension.
When daylight came Gilgamesh said to his friend: "Enkidu, thy [moth]er a gazelle, a wild ass thy father, [produce]d thee. They whose mar\ is their tails reared thee, and the cattle Of the steppe and of all the pastures. May the tracks of Enkidu in the Cedar Forest Weep for thee, may they not hush night and day. May the elders of wide, ramparted Uruk weep for thee. [May weep for thee] The finger that is extended behind us in blessing. May weep for thee And echo the countryside as though it were thy mother. May weep for thee [. . . ] In whose midst we . . . . May weep for thee bear, hyena, [panther], Tiger, hart, leopard, lion; oxen, deer, [ibex], (10) And the wild creatures of the steppe. May weep for thee the river Ula [. . . ] By whose banks we used to walk. May weep for thee the pure Euphrates, [where we drew]
Water for the skin. May weep for thee The warriors of wide, [ramparted] Uruk [. . . ] we slew the B u l l . . . . May weep for thee [. .. ] [Who] in Eridu extolled thy name. May weep for thee [...] [Who . . . ] extolled thy name. May weep for thee [...] [Who] provided . . . grain for thy mouth. May weep for thee [. . . ] [Who] put salve on thy back. May weep for thee [ . . . ] [Who] put ale in thy mouth. May weep for thee the [harlot]
[Who] anointed thee with fragrant oil.
May we[ep for thee . . . ] (20) [Of the h]arem who [brought to thee]
The wife and the ring of thy choice."
May brothers weep for thee like sisters [. . . and may they let grow long]
Their head-hair over thee [. . . ] ! "
(The following four lines follow line 23 on p. 88)
Then Gilgamesh issued a call to the land: "O smith,
Coppersmith, goldsmith, engraver!83 Make my friend
[Then] he fashioned a statue for his friend,
The friend whose stature [. . . ]:
" [ . . . ], of lapis is thy breast, of gold thy body, [. . . ]."

Tablet X
OLD BABYLONIAN VERSION
Another fragment of an Old Babylonian version of Tablet X was recently published by A. R. Millard, Iraq, xxvi (1964), 99-105 and CT, XLVI, 16. This piece is probably part of the same tablet as the "Meissner Fragment." Only the reverse is preserved and, if it does belong to the other Old Babylonian tablet, the text provides several more lines of columns iii and iv with a lacuna of undetermined size in between the two pieces.
(iii)
(The first line preserved is illegible.)
Gilgamesh [said] to he[r, to the ale-wife]: "What didst thou say, ale-wife [. . . ] ? My heart [grieves] for my friend. What didst thou say, ale-wife [. . . ] ? My heart [grieves] for Enkidu. Dwelling on the [sea-s]hore, O ale-wife, Thou dost see its depths, all [ . . . ]. Show (me) the way [. . . ].
If it be seemly, the sea [I will cross]." (10) The ale-wife said to him, [to Gilgamesh]: "Gilgamesh, there has never been . . . [ . . . ]
(There are traces of two more lines before a complete
break.)
(iv)
(The first three lines preserved are unintelligible.)
The two of them discussed [. . . ] [. . . ] spoke a word to him, Sursunabu says to him, to Gilgamesh: "The Stone Things, O Gilgamesh, bear me along, That I might not touch the waters of death. In thy anger thou didst smash them, The Stone Things (which) I kept to help (me) across. (10) Gilgamesh, [ta]ke the axe in thy hand, Cut three hundred [punting-po]les which are smooth. [. . . ] . . . the lashes like a spear."
(There are traces of one more line before a complete break.)
THE ASSYRIAN VERSION
The additions to the late sources for Tablet X have all been published by W . G. Lambert, CT, XLVI, 30, 32, 33. Some of these pieces were previously published in GETh and others by D. J. Wiseman in Garelli, Gilgames et sa Ugende, 128-35. Necessary changes have been made in the translation but there are some additions. A few more lines are preserved at the end of column ii (p. 9 1 ) .
In the forest . . . [ . . . ] (36) When Urshanabi saw the flash [of the dir\], And heard the axe . . . [ . . . ] . . . He struck his head [. . . ] Gilgamesh,
[Sei]zed the wings [ . . . ] the breast, (40) The Stone [Things . . . ] and the boat.

(A few more lines of Utnapishtim's speech near the beginning of column vi (p. 92) are now preserved:)
"Mankind, which like a reed [. . . ] (21) A fine young man, a fine young woman,
··· ^· · ·|
Should no one see death? Should no one [. . . ] ? " (23)
(Lines 24-25 are still unintelligible.)
Tablet XI
No new material has come to light for this tablet but one of the tablets used in the composite text of GETh has been recendy republished by W . G. Lambert, CT, XLVI, 35.
Tablet XII
The publication of a small Neo-Babylonian piece by W. G. Lambert, CT, XLVI, 34 (previously published by D . J. Wiseman in Garelli, GilgameS et sa Ugende, 133 and 135) has confirmed the restorations made at the beginning of this tablet on the basis of the Sumerian version. The necessary changes have been made in the translation. It should be noted that Landsberger has now rejected his earlier translation of putyu u mefyA as "drum and drumstick" (see p. 97, n. 233) and instead translates "wheel and stick.** See B. Landsberger, WZKM, LVI (i960), 124-26 and LVII (1961), 23. Since his new proposal is still problematical, no change has been made in the translation.
Nergal and Ereshkigal
ADDITIONS
In recent years a Neo-Assyrian version of this myth was discovered at Sultantepe and this find was announced by O. R. Gurney, Proceedings of the British Academy, XLI (1955), 27-33. A copy of the text was subsequently published as STT, I, No. 28 and two tiny fragments as STT, II, Nos. 113-14. An edition has been given by Gurney, AnSt, x (i960), 105-31. T h e Sultantepe tablet provides us with a much fuller version of the story but there are lacunae in it, some of which may be filled in from the Amarna tablet translated previously in this volume. The beginning of the myth is very fragmentary and it is not absolutely certain that this small piece belongs to the tablet (see Gurney, loc. cit., 106). It appears to be a hymn in praise of a deity, presumably Ereshkigal.
(i)
I u/ill praise [. . . queen of mankind], [. . . ] continually. I will praise [Ereshkigal, queen of mankind], [. . . ] c[ontinua]lly.

(There is a large lacuna of about twenty-six lines in which Namtar's ascent to heaven and entrance into the presence of the upper deities was narrated. After the lacuna there is a section, part of which is translated below, in which it is narrated that all the gods except Nergal bowed to Namtar. Because of the insult Nergal must descend to the nether world to apologize to Ereshkigal. Ea gives him advice on how to conduct himself on his journey.)

Atrahasis
Our knowledge of this epic has increased tremendously since the publication of the revised edition of this volume. The improvement of our understanding is due in large part to the article by I. Laess0e, "The Atrahasis Epic: A Babylonian History of Mankind," Bi.Or., xm (1956), 90-102 in which the numerous fragments of the composition are placed in their proper sequence. Of major importance as well has been the discovery and publication of hand copies of the greater part of the Old Babylonian version of the epic by W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard in CT, XLVI. In this latter publication the two authors have promised that their edition of the epic is forthcoming. It would be improper for the present author to anticipate this publication by attempting to present here a translation of the new texts. Therefore CT, XLVI will not normally be considered in this revision but all other recent publications will be taken into account. One major discovery resulting from recent research is that Speiser's so-called "Creation of Man by the Mother Goddess" which was translated on pp. 99 f. is in fact an integral part of the Atrahasis Epic. Using Laess0e's analysis as a basis there are, besides the Sumerian,59 four recensions of this epic, one Old Babylonian, one Middle Babylonian, and two Neo-Assyrian (which will be referred to as I and II) as well as fragments of other recensions. The Old Babylonian recension was inscribed on three tablets and described the creation of mankind, the flood which was sent to destroy the people who had been making an uproar, and the survival of Atrahasis with family and beasts in the ark. Only a tiny fragment of the Middle Babylonian recension (Speiser's fragment X) has been preserved and the narration concerns the building of the ark. T h e Neo-Assyrian version I (Laess0e's "Babylonian" recension—see loc. cit., 99 and 101) was inscribed on at least three tablets and differs considerably from the other recensions. The first tablet is apparendy the so-called "Syllabic Alphabet"60 which begins with the syllables me-me pat-pat and which, according to Gadd,61 was regarded by the compiler of this series as the first attempts at human

speech and therefore added to the epic in which the creation of mankind was described. The second tablet contained a mythological text in which the creation of mankind was narrated62 in a manner similar to but not identical with the other recensions of the Atrahasis Epic. The third tablet has not been identified with certainty but since it began with the words "When g o d . . . man" (the introductory phrase to the other recensions and the title of the Atrahasis Epic) it, as well as perhaps subsequent tablets, certainly contained a version of the Atrahasis Epic. There are fragments, including Speiser's fragment C, which may belong to the third or subsequent tablets of this version.63 The Neo-Assyrian version II (Laess0e's "Assyrian" recension—see loc. cit., 99 and 101) was inscribed on two tablets, only the first of which has been identified (Speiser's fragment D ) . Only a small part of the narrative is preserved and it concerns the creation of mankind and the events leading up to the flood.
OLD BABYLONIAN VERSION
A and Β
The first of the three tablets of the Old Babylonian version is the text Speiser called "Creation of Man by the Mother Goddess" which has been discussed under that heading in this section. The second and third tablets are Speiser's fragments A and Β respectively. No change has been made in Speiser's translation of 6 but the understanding of A has been improved by Laess0e's study in Bi.Or., xm ( 1 9 5 6 ) , 90-94. S o m e c o r r e c t i o n s h a v e b e e n incorporated in the body of the former translation but it should be noted that more is legible at the end of column vii.

MIDDLE BABYLONIAN VERSION

Speiser's fragment X is not Old Babylonian, as stated in the last edition of this volume, but Kassite or Middle Babylonian. See W. G. L a m b e r t , JSS, ν ( i 9 6 0 ) , 1 1 4 , η. ι.
NEO-ASSYRIAN VERSION I
C
The nature of this recension and the tablets, including perhaps Speiser's fragment C, which belong to it have been discussed above. A minor change has been made in Speiser's translation of C (line 16) in accordance with a suggestion of W. G. Lambert, JSS, ν ( i 9 6 0 ) , 1 1 4 , η· *·

Haupt, Das babylonischc Nimrodepos, 1 3 1 ; F. Delitzsch, Assyrische Lesestiic\c (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1885), 101. Another possible piece of this recension is K. 7816 which was published by K. D.

NEO-ASSYRIAN VERSION II
D
The only part of this two tablet version which has been identified is Speiser's fragment D which comes from the first tablet As Laess0e, loc. cit., 96-98, has pointed out the obverse and reverse of this fragment have been mistakenly identified and the sequence, as found in Speiser's translation, should be reversed. Thus Speiser's column numbers i, ii, and iii should be vi, v, and iv and arranged in numerical order. Further, the column of this fragment called "iv" by Speiser and translated on p. 100 as a separate myth is, as Laess0e, loc. cit., 98 has argued, an integral part of the Atrahasis Epic and should appear at the beginning of the translation of fragment D on p. 105 as column iii. Columns i and ii of D are missing. A few changes have been made in Speiser's translation in accordance with recent research.
Ε
A fragment68 which is almost certainly from a late recension of the Atrahasis Epic is BM. 98977 + 99231 and it will henceforth be referred to as fragment E. It was recently published by W. G. Lambert, JSS, ν (i960), 113-22. On the obverse is found a narration of how Ea informed Atrahasis of the coming flood and on the reverse is found a description of the flood itself. In both cases the text is similar to but not identical with parts of the eleventh tablet of Gilgamesh and the content of the reverse is also to be compared with the end of fragment A translated above.
(obverse) "[ . . . I heard] thee come in [and] [. . . ] . . . which is like [thy fo]otsteps."
[Atrahasis] bowed, knelt down, (then) stood up [. . . ]. He opened [his mouth] to speak: " [ . . . ] I heard thee come in and [. . . ] which is like thy footsteps. [. . . ] I heard thee come in and [. . . ] which is like [thy] footsteps.

Our knowledge of the Myth of Zu has increased considerably in the last few years due to discoveries at Sultantepe and the publication of CT, XLVL All of the new material relates to the late recension of which we now have most of Tablets I and II and a few fragments of Tablet III (?). There is a Sumerian tale about Zu which, although still not fully understood, seems to have some affinity with the Akkadian story. The texts are UET, vi, No. 2 and AASOR, x x m (1943-44), No. 41. Cf. M. Civil, RA, LX (1966), 92.
When Speiser prepared his translation for Tablet II of the late recension he had only the fragmentary text, LKA, No. 1. In order to present a meaningful translation, therefore, he made a conflation of the Old Babylonian versions and the LKA (Ebcling) version which appeared on pp. 111 f. and in the Addenda of the second edition. Since we now have an almost complete text for Tablet II of the late recension it has been considered advisable to present both versions separately. Therefore all of the material that came from LKA, No. 1 has been withdrawn from the translation of the Old Babylonian version on pp. n i f . and the now almost complete Tablet II of the late recension will be presented here. The points of contact between the two texts will be obvious to the reader. In the Addenda to the second edition of this volume Speiser presented a translation of Tablet III of the Old Babylonian version which was in reality again a conflation of the Old Babylonian version and LKA, No. 1. With
71 A scribal note indicates there is a break in the original tablet. 72 Cf. Gilgamesh XI, 107.
73 Lambert, loc. cit., regarded lines 18-19 as a cry of Ishtar and translated: [ " . . . ] take away the flood! [ . . . ] for the peoples!
Summon the mighty o n d " The present author has taken i-ta-fa-a as a present Gt of asu (and not an imperative of nasi) and i-ba-a as a present G (and not imperative) .of bd'u. Cf. MuJIIk*m *l*kaKkf *£r-ra mata i-ba-'(-i), "The sword of Irra will overrun the land for three years," CT, xxxix, 33:46 and CT, XL, 46:44 and cf. CAD, 11 (B), 180.
For \aiulu, "divine weapon" (von Soden, AHw, 463 f.), in the sense of "destruction" note \a-lu-lu — na-as-pan-[tu] CT, xxx, 9:11 and cf. E. F. Weidner, AfO, Beiheft XII (1959), 30, note to line 9.
the publication here of Tablet II of the late recension which contains almost all of the material found in Tablet III of the Old Babylonian version the need for Speiser's composite text has been obviated and it has not been included. In fact no translation of Tablet III of the Old Babylonian version has been included since it is extremely fragmentary and is duplicated by Tablet II of the late recension. The only exception is the last four lines of Susa III which will be discussed later.

Tablet I
N e w sources for Tablet I are: W . G. Lambert, CT, X L V I , 36 (K. 7257 given in transliteration by E. Reiner, RA, LI [1957], 107-08), 37, 39 ( D T . 292—joins K. 3454 + 3935—published in transliteration by E. Reiner, RA, XLVIII [1954], 146), 40 (Sm. 1807—only variants from it given by E. Reiner, RA, XLVIII [1954], 146). All of the new material for Tablet I has been incorporated in the translation on pp. 112 f. with a few exceptions. The beginning of column i is now preserved:
The son of the king of inhabited places, The illustrious, beloved of Mami, The strong one, the god, child of [Enli]l, I will ever praise. Ninurta, the illustrious, beloved of Mami, [The strong] one, the god, child of Enlil, I will ever glorify.

Tablet II
The sources for this tablet are: LKA, N o . I and see E. Ebeling, RA, XLVI (1952), 25-41. STT, I, Nos. 19, 21, and 22. CT, XLVI, No. 38 ( K . 3008—previously published in transliteration by E. Reiner, RA, XLVIII, 1954, 146-149). CT, XLVI, N o . 41. The new material for this tablet has necessitated an entirely new translation. W h e n the narration begins, Mami is speaking.
". . . to appoint a time; .. . send forth brilliance. Launch thy full offensive, Let thy seven ill winds go against him. Vanquish the fugitive Zu, And (thus) bring peace to the earth [which] I created, While bringing chaos to his abode. Heap up things to frighten him, Let thy terrifying offensive rage against him; Cause the entire whirlwind to attack?8 him, Draw79 the bow (and) let the arrows carry poison. (10) Let thy countenance become like a demon's, Send out a fog so he cannot recognize thy face. Let thy radiance go against him, [In . . . and] steppe thou wilt have brilliance. May the sun not shine over him, May the bright [day] turn to gloom on him. Slit his throat, vanquish Zu, Let the winds carry his wings to a secret place, Toward Ekur, to thy father Enlil. Take flood (and) confusion in to the midst of
the [mountain]s, (20)
Cut the throat of evil Zu. Let the sovereignty (again) enter Ekur, Let the norms return [t]o the fa[ther who] begot thee. Let built shrines [appear], Establish thy cult sites [in the] four [quarters]. [Let] thy [cult sites] enter (again) into Ekur, (And) may thy mighty name be splendid before the gods!"

He was wroth, he raged (and) departed for his (Zu's) mountain. My lord hitched the Seven-of-the-Batde, (30) The hero hitched the seven ill winds, The seven whirlwinds which stir up the dust, He launched a terrifying war, a fierce conflict.
While the gale at his side shrieked for strife, Zu and Ninurta met on the mountainside. When Zu saw him he raged at him, He ground (his teeth) like a demon, his brilliance covered the mountain, He roared like a Hon seized with anger, In his rage he called [to the h]ero: "I have carried off everyone of the norms, (40) And (therefore) the decrees of all the gods I direct; Who art thou to come to fight with me? Explain thyself!"
He advanced aggressively80 toward him and the word

of the Destinies.
I have come [to thee] to fight with thee . .
When Zu heard the word of his mouth,
In the midst of the mountain range he let loose a
piercing shriek.
There was darkness, the face of the mountain was
covered, (50)
Ninurta, the light of the gods, entered the gloom.
Adad . . . roared, his thunder pursued85 Zu,
In the midst of the conflict, (in the midst of) the war,
He launched fourteen storm floods,
Dressed in armor he bathed in blood,
Clouds of death sent rain, the lightning flashes were
arrows.
He stood in their midst while the battle roared,
The strong, the illustrious, the child of Mami,
The hope of Anu and Dagan, the beloved of Ninigiku,
He loaded86 [the . . . ] of the bow with an arrow,87
From the breast of the bow he loosed88 the arrow

long been recognized. See R. Borger, Einleitung in die Assyrischen
Konigsinschriften, 1 (Laden, 1961), 129. Here it obviously means
"arrow" and no doubt has the same meaning in the other passages
cited by Borger. 88 Lit.: "brought."

But the arrow could not approach Zu, it turned back, (For) Zu called to it: "O arrow that [has] come, return to thy canebrake, Stave89 [of the bow] (return) to thy wood, (Return, bow)-gut, to the sheep's rump, return wings90 to the birds!" While he bore the [Tablet of De]stinies of the gods in his hand, . . . [ . . . the arrows] could not approach his body. The ba[tt]le [was st]illed, the conflict ceased, The weapons were stopped, in the midst of the mountain They vanquished not Zu. He (Ninurta) called to Adad and gave him instructions: (70) "Repeat to him, to Ea Ninigiku, the deeds which
thou hast observed:
'O lord, Ninurta was encircling Zu,
Ninurta was girding up the dust of destruction;
He loaded [the . . . ] of the bow with an arrow,
He drew the bow and loosed the arrow at him,
But the arrow could not approach Zu, it turned back,
(For) Zu called to it:
"O arrow that has come, return to thy canebrake,
Stave of the bow (return) to thy wood,
(Return, bow)-gut, to the sheep's rump, return wings
to the birds!" (80)
While he bore the Tablet of Destinies of the gods
in his hand,
. . . the arrows could not approach his body.
The battle was stilled, the conflict ceased,
The weapons were stopped, in the midst of the mountain
they vanquished not Zu.'"
Adad, the prince, took the report,
The news of the fight he bore to Ea Ninigiku.
Whatever the lord had spoken to him he repeated to Ea:
"O lord, Nifnurta] was encircling Zu,
Ninurta was gir[ding up] the dust of destruction;
[He loaded the . . . of the bow with an arrow], (90)
He drew the bow and loosed the arrow at him,
But the arrow could not approach [Z]u, it turned back,
(For) Zu called to it:
'O arrow that has come, return to [thy] canebrake,
Stave of the bow (return) to thy wood,
[(Return, bow-)gu]t, to the sheep's [rump], [return]
wings to the birds!'
89 mu-um-mu. Speiscr's translation has been retained. In the previous edition of this book his footnote to this word read: "The present translation proceeds from the fact that among the several meanings established for this term (cf. A. H e i d e l , JNES, VII, 1948, 9 8 - 1 0 5 ) there is included a reference to a household implement. The context, moreover, shows that the wooden part of the bow is meant in this instance; hence 'back, stave,' or the like." 90 Does this refer to feathers on the arrow ?
(
[While he bore the Tablet of Destinies] of the gods [in his] h[and], [. . . the arrows could not approach his body]. [The battle was] s[tilled, the conflict ceased], [The weapons were] s[topped, in the midst of the mountain they vanquished not Zu]." (100) When [Ea Ninigi]ku heard the word of his son, He called to [Adad and] gave him instructions: "Repeat [to him], to thy lord, my instructions, Wha[te]ver I say outline to him: 'In battle do not tire, prove thy strength, Subdue him, by the onslaught of the south wind let his
pinions be overcome.91
Take the . . .-weapon92 to the back of thy darts,
Cut off his pinions, scatter93 (them) to the right and
left.
When he sees his wings (the sight) will rob him of
speech:94
"Wing to wing!"95 he will cry, fear him no
(longer). ( n o )
Draw thy bow (and) from its breast let fly the
arrows like lightning,
Let pinions (and) wings dance like bloody things.96
Slit his throat, vanquish Zu,
Let the winds carry his wings to a secret place,
Toward Ekur, to thy father Enlil.
Take flood (and) confusion into the midst of the
mountains,
Cut the throat of evil Zu.
Let the sovereignty (again) enter Ekur,
Let the norms return [to] the fat[her] who
begot thee.
Let built shrines appear, (120)
Establish thy cult sites in the four quarters.
Let thy cult sites enter (again) into Ekur,
(And) may thy mighty name be splendid bef[ore the
gjods!'"
[Adad], the prince, took the directions,
Instructions for the fight [he b]ore to Ninurta, his lord,
Wha[tev]er Ea said he repeated to him:
"In battle do not tire, prove thy strength,
Subdue him, [by the onslaught] of the south wind let
his pinions be overcome.
91 lid-di: lit.: " L e t it o v e r c o m e . " N o t e the O l d Babylonian version w h i c h has limqit. 92 til-lum·. T h e nature of this w e a p o n is uncertain. 93 ru-'-im: Obviously this is not f r o m the root m e a n i n g "to have mercy." 94 Zu will be so concerned about his wings that he will neglect to c o m m a n d N i n u r t a ' s arrows to turn back as he did in the previous encounter. 95 Cf. Gilgamesh VI, 50. 96 sat da-mc. T h e reading is clear in STT, I, N o . 21 and the traces for line 134 in LKA, N o . 1 (iii 1 6 ) certainly support this reading.

Fragmentary descriptions of the subsequent battle which took place between Ninurta and Zu have been recently published. Presumably these pieces come from Tablet III of the epic. The fullest account is found in the two duplicates, STT, I, Nos. 23 and 25. Mention is made of the south, north, east, and west winds and this is followed by a description of Zu becoming frightened and the general confusion that prevailed. Note particularly line 27:
He routed Zu and cut his throat.
Ninurta is mentioned in line 13 and he may be the god responsible for vanquishing Zu. Cf. O. R. Gurney, Proceedings of the British Academy, XLI (1955), 26-27. The two pieces are too fragmentary to warrant translation here. CT, XLVI, No. 42 also belongs to the Zu Epic and, since it contains references to various weapons, may describe the same events as those narrated in STT, I, Nos. 23 and 25. The fragment is too small to deserve translation. Finally, it should be noted that the beginning of the battle is described in the last four lines of the third tablet of the Old Babylonian Susa version:
[. . . ] He (Ningirsu) sent forth the four winds [to
d]o battle.
[. . . ] the earth shook, filled [. . . ]
[. . . ] its [. . . ] became dark, the heavens [became]
black,
[. . . ] at the onset of the south wind the pinions of Zu [were overcome].
Etana
ADDITIONS
No new texts have come to light for this myth97 but a hand copy of the Middle Assyrian Version (previously utilized in the translation) has been published by E. Ebeling, LKA, No. 14. A recent study by W. von Soden, WZKM, LV (1959), 59-61 has shed further light on the interpretation of the tale and a few changes have been made in the former translation. The study of von Soden enables us to present here a translation of the first eight lines of the Neo-Assyrian Version. The city referred to in these lines is certainly Kish since it was, according to the Sumerian King List, the city to which the kingship first descended after the flood and Etana was a king of that city.
They planned the city [. . . ], The [. . . ] gods [la]id [the foundation]. They planned the \sK\rine, not [ . · . ] , The [. . . ] gods laid its foundation. May [the city] be the nest, the resting place of [mankind],

A Babylonian Theogony
Recently a document unique in Akkadian literature was published by A. R. Millard, CT, XLVI, No. 43 and translated by W. G. Lambert with a discussion of Classical parallels by P. Walcot in Kadmos, iv (1965), 64-72. It is a late Babylonian copy of a theogony which came from Dunnu, an obscure Babylonian city. Other theogonies are known in Akkadian literature, such as the famous one which begins the Epic of Creation, but these are usually conflations of various traditions from different cities. The present text apparently contains the tradition of only one city. The gods are paired, male and female, the first two being Hain, an otherwise unknown male deity, and Earth. These two brought into existence the next pair of deities, Amakandu98 and Sea, as well as the city, Dunnu. In the subsequent lines of the text is found the stereotyped account of how, by means of incest and murder, one divine pair succeeded another. Only the names of one more pair, Lahar99 and River, are completely preserved. The names of the male consorts of Ga'um and Ningeshtinna are missing. The dates upon which each new god took control are given and these were obviously related to important festivals of the city, Dunnu.

El-kunirsha beheld the Storm-god and asked him: "[Why] didst thou come?" Thus said the Storm-god: "When I entered thy house, (10) Ashertu sent out (her) maidens to me (saying). 'Come, sleep with me!' [When] I refused, she became aggressive and said to me as follows: 'Give thyself to me, [then] I shall give myself to thee; I shall harass thee with my word, ( 1 5 ) with my spindle I shall prick thee.'

With Ashertu he slept. The Storm-god said to Ashertu: "Of thy sons I slew 77, I slew 88." Ashertu (25) heard this humiliating word of the Storm-god and her mind got incensed against him.

Asia Minor
T R A N S L A T O R : J. J. FINKELSTEIN
The Laws of Ur-Nammu
Ur-Nammu (2112-2095 B.C.) was the founding ruler of the 3rd Dynasty of U r , the builder of the best preserved ziggurat in ancient Mesopotamia, whose reign inaugurated the last great period of Sumerian literary creativity. Although some contemporary examples of this creative effort have begun to come to light in recent excavations at Nippur, most of the literary and scholarly production of this period is known only from copies produced in the scribal schools in Nippur and Ur some two to three hundred years later, i.e. between 1800 and 1700 B.C. T h i s is true of the two extant manuscripts of the Ur-Nammu Laws. T e x t A, Ni 3191, was copied in Nippur, and was edited by S. N. Kramer in Orientalia, XXIII (1954), pp. 40 if., with additional notes by A. Falkenstein, ibid. pp. 49 ff. T h i s tablet originally contained eight columns of writing, four on each side, but less than half of the original content is preserved. Almost all of the obverse, the better preserved face, is devoted to the prologue, so that very litde legal material is preserved in this text. T e x t B consists of two fragments, U.7739 and U.7740, of what was once a single tablet, but the two fragments do not join. T h e y were found in Ur, and like text A, were written by a student scribe during the Old Babylonian period. T h i s text was edited by 0. R. Gurney and S. N. Kramer in AS, xvi (1965, the Landsberger Festschrift), pp. 13-19. T h e editors thought that the tablet was intended to contain ten columns of writing—five on each face—of which only the obverse, one column on the reverse, plus one line on the next column were completed. T h e student scribe, for some unknown reason stopped at that point, and failed to complete the tablet. As will be indicated below, the present translator believes that the tablet was originally intended to contain eight columns rather than ten (like the A text), of which the four of the obverse and one on the reverse (col. v) plus one additional line were actually completed. (This opinion has since been confirmed by Dr. E. Sollberger of the British Museum who has kindly provided the present author with photographs of the two fragments, and the information about their relative points of thickness, which precludes the possibility of an additional column.) The present translation for the first time integrates both manuscripts into a single text as far as the extant material allows. The line count of text A as given by Kramer, while in need of some adjustment in the light of B, is retained here for the convenience of reference. T h e numeration §§ of text B is also retained here and cited within parentheses. T h e translation, while the responsibility of the present translator, is built upon that of S. N. Kramer in his original edition, and owes much besides to the enthusiastic cooperation of Professor Kramer while it was being prepared.

B A B B A R [I - 1 & - e] and thus matching B ii 1-2. Unless there is a
scribal error in B, the small penalty would seem to preclude the possibility that the accusation was either sorcery or murder. It is possible, too, that the penalty of three shekels is not against the false accuserwho would normally have been denoted as such, as in the next section (hi 1 - d a -1 & - a)—but against the person who administered the ordeal (1 u i n - t u m - m u ) . 17 Although just a few traces at the beginnings of the lines of this section are preserved, they are sufficient to show that the topic concerned the "rejected bridegroom," and is almost an exact parallel to § 29 of the laws of Lipit-Ishtar. It constitutes yet another Sumerian prototype for § 25 of the Laws of Eshnunna and § 161 of the Laws of Hammurabi. The certain and near-certain restorations on which the translation is based cannot be given here in detail. They will appear in the complete re-edition of the Laws of Ur-Nammu which the present writer expects to publish elsewhere.
18 The traces would suggest that this rule, like § 14, also dealt with runaway persons and reward for their capture and return. 19 Cf. Hammurabi § 17 and Hittite Laws § 22. 20 It is certain that other § 15 or § 16 is omitted in the Ur ms.,
but due to the lacunae in both texts, and to the evidence that their wording differs to some degree, it is difficult to ascertain which of the two has been omitted in B. The solution adopted here is based on the verb used in § 16, zi - i r, "to smash, crush," which is not found in B, where the verb used in all cases is k us, "to cut o f f , sever." It is
nevertheless certain that the two mss. "join" at around this point since
text B ii 36 must be read as g l r - p a [ d - d u ] , "bone, limb," and is
consequendy to be brought into some relationship to the g i r - p a d d u of line 334 of the A text.
21 Cf. Hammurabi § 198 where this sum applies when the victim is
a "crown dependent" (muikenu).

such injuries, cf. Eshnunna § 42, Hammurabi § 200 f. (1/3 mina for

rule reduces the sum considerably, prescribing 12 shekels for "two or
three teeth" of a free man, and 6 shekels for a slave, suggesting that
a realistic fine for one tooth could be two shekels at least in some
instances.

someone else's slave for more than a month, and the penalty for that

that in some fashion this section is paralleled by Lipit-Ishtar § 14 (see
previous note), which deals with a slave who contested his status with
his master after the latter had certified his legal tide to the slave on
two earlier occasions (this is the correct meaning of the law, as earlier
translators had seen, and as understood by Falkenstein, Orientalia, xix
[1950] 107 f.). The penalty to be suffered by the slave (a 1 - b ü r - e)
must denote some physical mutilation which may also have served
as a permanent mark of his slave status.

the lawful demands of the owner of the field, loses even the right to
recover his agricultural expenses (e.g. seed-corn, and the cost of rent

Sumerian Laws
Y B C 2177
Since the publication of this text almost sixty years ago, it was thought to represent a part of the "lawcode" of some unknown ruler of the pre-Hammurabi period. In actual fact, however, the text is a student exercise executed in one of the scribal schools of Southern Mesopotamia (i.e., Sumer) some time during the Old Babylonian period, probably ca. 1800 B.C. T h e obverse of the tablet has never been published due to its very poor state of preservation, but from those lines of it which are still legible it can be ascertained that it consisted in considerable part of disconnected legal phrases and sentences revolving about a limited number of topics, such as pledges for loans, and loss of animals, and that it contained a number of repetitions. The text may therefore be described as a "forerunner" of the later formularies and vocabularies specializing in legal phraseology which were compiled for the scribal craft, such as ana ittisu (edited by B. Landsberger in Materialien zum sumerischen Lexicon, Vol. 1, Rome, 1937), and the first two tablets of the longer series known as HAR-ra: hubullu {ibid., Vol. v, 1957). The present translation is limited to the reverse of the tablet, which contains a small number of "laws" or sections grouped around a few basic topics. None of these "laws" is completely articulated in the manner of those found in the better-known "codes," but the sense is often clear, so that the additional phraseology required to fill out the sense may be supplied within parentheses with some degree of confidence. In other instances, especially where the student scribe committed errors, or where the text is laconic or damaged, the legal sense can only be guessed at.
Text: A. T. Clay, Yale Oriental Series, Babylonian Texts, Vol. 1, no. 28, cf. ibid., pp. 18 ff.; and J. J. Finkelstein, JAOS, LXXXVI (1966), pp. 357 ff.
(rev. col. iv) 1: If (a man accidentally) buffeted a woman of the free-citizen class and caused her to have a miscarriage, he must pay 10 shekels of silver. 2: If (a man deliberately) struck a woman of the freecitizen class and caused her to have a miscarriage, he must pay one-third mina of silver.1 3: If (a boat captain) violated the itinerary to which he was committed, and (thereby) brought about the loss of the boat, he shall measure out to its owner as much as the boat . . . , (and) its hire of . . . .2

1 i.e., twenty shekels, or twice the compensation prescribed in § 1.
2 The offence appears, in general, to parallel § 5 of the Lipit-Ishtar
laws as supplemented by Steele from an additional fragment published
in Archiv Orientalni, xvm (1950), pp. 491 ff., but the penal clause in
the present rule contains some obscure phraseology. The interpretation
suggested here presumes that the subject of the rule is the boat captain
rather than the person who chartered it, since it appears that the com
pensation was intended to cover the cargo as well as the boat itself,
and the loss to its owner of its potential revenue from charter. The
recent interpretation of this section by H. Petschow, in ZA, NF, xxiv (1967), pp. 1-4, is based on some readings and emendations that are
not borne out by the original tablet.

The Edict of Ammisaduqa
It was the custom in Mesopotamia during the Old Babylonian period, but going back possibly to late Early Dynastic times, for the kings to proclaim an act of "justice" or "equity" (Sumerian n i g. s i. s a = Akkadian miiarum) at the beginning of their reigns and at intervals of seven or more years thereafter. Such acts, concerned mainly with the remission of debts and other obligations, as well as the reversion of land holdings to their original owners, were known heretofore from allusions to them in royal year-names, and references to them in certain private legal documents. T h e Edict of Ammisaduqa, the 10th ruler of the Hammurabi Dynasty in Babylon (1646-1626 B.C.), represents the only extant substantial text proper of such an edict, the only other one known being a fragment of a similar edict issued by Samsuiluna (1749-1712 B.C.), the great-grandfather of Ammisaduqa. There is good reason to believe, however, that the early law-"codes," such as those of Ur-Nammu, Lipit-Ishtar, the kingdom of Eshnunna, and the great "code" of Hammurabi incorporate within their texts at least some of the provisions of the misharum-acts proclaimed by them during the course of their

although it may contain only a variation of circumstance, or even a
repetition of the preceding rule. 4 For this and the next section, see JAOS, LXXXVI, pp. 357 3.
6 The interpretation of this section is extremely problematic due to
the obscurity of the descriptive term of the ox (similarly described in

rendered here in italics, is to be reiid I b - r i - TIL (the last sign is
over erasure). It remains unclear whether the subject (equally ambigu
ous, as the translation implies) is responsible for full compensation, or
whether he is quit by turning over to the owner the remains of the
dead animal. •This section would appear to resemble the goring ox rules of the
other law collections (e.g., Eshnunna § 53, Exod. 21:35 f·)·
reigns, and it is likely that the well-known "reform" inscription of Urukagina, the last king of Lagash of the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2350 B.C.), is a text of a closely related type. The main edition of the Edict is that of F. R. Kraus, Ein Edify des Königs Ammifaduqa von Babylon (Studia et Documenta ad Jura Orientis Antiqui Pertinentia, Vol. v, Leiden 1958) based on mss. A (Ni 632 in Istanbul) and B (B.M. 78259, British Museum). T h e present translation incorporates ms. C, B.M. 80289, ^ e full edition of which is to appear in RA, LXIII (1969). As this manuscript provides the beginning of the text, it necessitated a new numbering of the paragraphs of the edict, Kraus* § 1' becoming here § 3, etc. Further literature: J. J. Finkelstein, "Ammisaduqa's Edict and the Babylonian 'Law-Codes,'" JCS, xv (1961), 91 ff.; Kraus, "Ein Edikt des Königs Samsu-iluna von Babylon," AS, xvi (1965), 225 ff.; Finkelstein, "Some New Misharum Material and its Implications," ibid., 223 ff.

Preamble
These are the words of the Sun Suppiluliumas, the great king, the king of the Hatti land, the valiant, the favorite of the Storm-god.

Historical Introduction
I, the Sun, [made you my vassal.] And if you, [Aziras, protect' the king of the Hatti land, your master,] the king of the Hatti land, your mafster, will 'protect' you in the same way.] (5) The way [you 'protect'] your own [soul, your own person, your own body] and your own land, ['protect' the soul of the king, the person of the king,] the body of the king and the [Hatti] land [in the same way!] In the days to come 'protect' [you, Aziras, the king of the Hatti land] and the Hatti land, [my sons and my grandsons.] 300 she[kels of refined gold,] (10) first class (and) pure, shall be the tribute to the king of the Hatti land per year. Let them weigh [it out with the weighing stones of the merchants o]f the Hatti land. [And, you, Az]iras, should come to the Hatti land to the Sun once a year. Formerly, in fact, the king of the land of Egypt, (15) the king of the Hurri land, the king [of . . . , the king of the country Kinza, the ki]ng of the country Nuhassa, the king of the country Niya, the king of the country [. . ., the king of the country Mukis], the king of the country Halba, the king of the country Kargamis—all these kings were hostile [to the Sun]. But Aziras, the king of [Amurru] land, parted from the gate of Egypt and became subservient to the Sun, the k[ing of H]atti land. (20) And the Sun, the great king, was ve[ry happy] a b o u t . . . . that Aziras fell down at the feet of the Sun. Aziras parted from the gate of Egypt and (25) fell d[own at the feet of the Sun.] I, the Sun, the great king, [ac
cepted] Aziras [in vassalage] and added him to his brethren. [Th]en Azi[ras . . . . ] To [the Sun, the great king], his lord, he spoke as follows: [". . . ] together with my house [. . . ] (30) I have surrendered and . . . [ . . . ] .

Troops (and) charioteer]s of the Hatti land [are coming to attack (you)]; so be on your guard!" [thereby] you will transgress the oath.

Akkadian Treaties from Syria and Assyria
TRANSLATOR: ERICA REINER
Before the discovery of the treaty of Esarhaddon with the vassal princes only a f e w treaties imposed by Mesopotamian sovereigns were known, and those were in a fragmentary state of preservation. The newly found Esarhaddon treaty not only increases the actually available textual material but also serves to restore and to increase the understanding of the previously known treaty fragments. Understandably, the parallelism with Biblical material has given rise to a vast literature which is listed in the bibliographies in the monographs of Hillers and McCarthy cited below. See also the recent Borger HKL i under the respective texts. Except for two treaties from Alalakh, only the treaties imposed by Assyrian kings are translated here. Mesopotamian treaties not translated here: Treaty between ShamshiAdad V and Mardukzakirshumi I (published by Weidner, AfO, viii, 2 7 i f . ) ; Treaty between Sinshumlishir and Sinsharishkun and Nabuapaliddina ( B R M , iv, 50, see Borger, JCS, xix, 7 6 ) ; fragment of a treaty ( ? ) between Ilum-glmil of Uruk and an unknown k i n g ( ? ) (published by Falkenstein, Baghdader Mitteilungen, 11 (1963), 54 f . ) , identified by F.

Seal of Ir-DIM, king of Tunip.
Preamble
Text (of the agreement) sanctioned by an oath to the gods, between Niqmepa, king of Mukishhe [and Alalakh], and Ir-diM, king of Tunip; Niqmepa and Ir-DIM have now established [this agreement] between them as
follows:
1. [If anyone], whether [merchants, whether Suteans, .. . [wants to sell], be it barley, (be it) emmer, (be it) oil, [ — ] . . . [he must not] sell [it without authorizationt],
2. [If in your land] there is [a plot against me, and] they plot1 [to . . . , and you hear of it], you will search
11 restore [i-dab] -bu-ba-a in line 11.
for them, [if] they say, [". . .] we [are citizens of] Mukishhe," you must not kill those2 men [but you have to extradite them]. 3. If someone from my land [plots against me], if you hear of it, you must8 [ . . . ] and you must not conceal it from me, and if he lives in your land, you must extradite him. 4. If any booty coming from my land is sold in your land,4 you must seize it, together with the one who sells it, and hand it over to me. 5. If a fugitive slave, male or female, of my land flees to your land, you must seize and return him to me, (or), if someone else seizes him and takes him to you, [you must keep him] in your prison, and whenever his owner comes forward, you must hand him over to [him]. If (the slave) is not to be found, you must give him (the owner) an escort, and he may seize him in whatever town he (the slave) is found; (in any town where) he is not found, the mayor and five elders will declare under oath: "Your slave does not live among us and we do not conceal him"—if they are unwilling to take the oath, but (eventually) return his slave, [they go free], but if they take the oath and later he discovers his slave [among them], they are considered thieves and their hands are cut off, (moreover) they will pay 6,000 (shekels of) copper to the palace.
6. If a man, woman, ox, donkey, or horse [is found] in the house of somebody (and the owner) identifies it, but (the man in whose possession it was found) declares: "I have bought it," if he can produce the merchant, he goes free, but if he cannot produce the merchant, he who has identified it, . . . he will declare under oath: ["It is my . . ."], but if he is unwilling to take the oath, [he is considered a thief and his hands are cut off].
7. If you hold a man in custody, he may do (forced) labor with/for a [. . . ]-man, (but) if he (the latter) [ta\es o f f ] his fetters, shaves off his slavemark, [. . . ] and they catch him, he is considered a thief. If he declares: ["The man is mine"] he will declare under oath as follows: ["(I swear) that the man is mine"]; if he is unwilling to take the oath, [he is a th]ief [ . . . ] . If the criminal, man, woman, or boy, does (forced) labor in his house, and (the owner?) seizes him, he is considered a thief, and his (the-criminaTs) master will have him

8. If a brigand from your land commits a robbery or breaks into a house or town in my land, and they seize him and [put him] in prison, whenever his (the robber's) owner [claims him], the owner of the house (broken into) will declare under oath: "I(!) have caught him as he was breaking and entering (lit.: at the breach or the . . . of the moat)," and he has to bring witnesses, and they can convict him and . .. him.8 But a slave cannot be made to take the oath, and he (the accused robber) goes free. 9. [If families from my land] enter your land to find subsistence, you must take them into custody in your land, and feed them, (but) whenever they want to [ret]urn to my land, you must gather them and return them to [my land], and you must not detain one single family in your land. 10. If a man from your land enters my land to find subsistence, and says: "In my city [there is nothing] to [eat,]" [. . . ] if he is a criminal, [. . . ] 11. If there is a city or a [. . . ], they live with the people [in] my city, [ . . . ] . . . you must seize them, .. . you must [not] seize them. 12. [If] (any) Hurrian (subject of) our lord becomes an enemy of the king of the Hurrians, I will not break the oath made with the king of the Hurrians, my lord, (unless) he releases me from these stipulations of the oath. 76. Seal of Niqmepa, king of Alalakh. 77. Whosoever transgresses these agreements, Adad, [ . . . ] and Shamash, the lord of judgment, Sin, and the great gods will make him perish, [will make disappear] his name and (his) descendants from the lands, [. . . ], they will make him forsake his throne and scepter [...].
Treaty Between
Idrimi and Pilliya
Text: D. J. Wiseman, The Alalafy Tablets, No. 3. Transliteration and summary: ibid. p. 31 f.
1. Tablet of agreement. 2. When Pilliya and Idrimi took an oath by the gods and made this binding agreement between themselves: they will always return their respective fugitives, (i.e.) if Idrimi seizes a fugitive of Pilliya, he will return him to Pilliya, and if Pilliya seizes a fugitive of Idrimi, he will return him to Idrimi. Anyone who seizes a fugitive, and returns him to his master, (the owner) will pay as prize of capture 500 (shekels of) copper if it is a man, one thousand as prize of capture if it is a woman. However,
if a fugitive from Pilliya enters the land of Idrimi and nobody seizes him, but his own master seizes him, he need not pay a prize of capture to anyone. In whatever city (it is suspected that) they conceal a fugitive, the mayor and five elders will make a declaration under oath. From the very day on which Barattarna has sworn (this) oath by the gods together with Idrimi, from that day on it is decreed that fugitives have to be returned. Whoever transgresses this agreement, DIM, Shamash and Ishhara, and all the (other) gods will destroy him.
Treaty Between
Ashurnirari V of Assyria and
Mati'ilu of Arpad
Text and translation: E. Weidner, AfO, VIII, 17 ff. The British Museum text 79-7-8,195, according to Bezold, Catalogue, p. 1716, belongs to the same tablet as Rm 120 + published by Weidner. The fragment, copied by Geers, is the bottom of the middle (possibly the right-hand) column of one side; it most likely represents the bottom of column v (possibly column iv) of the reverse, and contains four beginnings of lines of the end of one paragraph and the beginning of the first four lines of the next, beginning with: sum-mu " K I .

May Mati'ilu [together with his sons,] daughters, officials, the people of his land [be . . . ] like . . . , and he himself, together with the people of his land, be crushed like gypsum.

If Mati'ilu sins against (this) treaty made under oath by the gods, then, just as this spring lamb, brought from its fold, will not return to its fold, will not behold its fold again, alas, Mati'ilu, together with his sons, daughters, officials, and the people of his land [will be ousted] from his country, will not return to his country, and not behold his country again. This head is not the head of a lamb, it is the head of Mati'ilu, it is the head of his sons, his officials, and the people of his land. If Mati'ilu sins against this treaty, so may, just as the head of this spring lamb is torn off, and its knuckle placed in its mouth, [ . . . ] , the head of Mati'ilu be torn off, and his sons [. . . ].

Let there be no milk2 to suck for the oxen, asses, sheep, and horses in his land. May Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, put an end to Mati'ilu, his land and the people of his land through hunger, want, and famine, so that they eat the flesh of their sons and daughters and it taste as good to them as the flesh of spring lambs. May they be deprived of Adad's thunder8 so that rain be denied them. Let dust be their food, pitch their ointment, donkey's urine their drink, rushes their clothing, let their sleeping place be in the corners (of walls).

I would translate this: "Our fine bow refuses (text: refused) to bend, and has become too hard (to string) for our strength (or: arms)." The compound bow used by the Assyrians had to be snapped back for stringing, and long disuse would have destroyed the resilience of the bow, so that it would have been impossible to bend it for stringing in preparation for shooting. The curse here refers to the same situation.

26 The verb gullulu in line 628 (certainly neither gullulu, "to an," nor qullulu, "to treat lighdy") must simply mean "to blind." 27 I take the expression araru hatu in line 626 to be synonymous w i t h hita hatu.

been inferior to that of a "first" wife under the circumstances envisaged

it is equally possible that Hatala is the subject, if the verb is rendered
"provided" rather than "produced," but the sense is not materially
affected o t h e r w a y .
3 The rendering is based on the fact that the pronoun and the verb
are masculine, but considering that the masculine is also used through·

object of the first and the second, it might be presumed that she is
the subject here also, which would configure better with the fact that
it is she who was to provide the slavewoman to begin with, and pre

Never again shall (20') Nidnusha son of Iddinunim bring suit against Lamassi, the votary2 of Shamash, daughter of Puzur-Akshak, Beltani, the votary of Shamash, daughter of Manium, Iltani, the votary of Shamash, daughter of Irra-gamil, and the daughter of Sin-eribam, with respect to anything which Amat-Shamash, the votary of Shamash, daughter of Supapum had (25') bequeathed to them, from chaff to gold. He may not plead: "I have forgotten this." Nor shall the brothers of Amat-Shamash, as many as there may be, bring suit against them. Because Nidnusha (30') has terminated their case, Nidnusha will be held responsible for their (future) contest and suit.
They swore the oath by Shamash, Marduk, Sinmuballit, and the city of Sippar. Names of witnesses (mostly destroyed).

Thus (replied) Bittatti: " [ . . . ] in the city of Suharuwa, [. . . ] I am (indeed) reckoned (as an heir) in [the estate of] my mother; why8 have you4 then taken the extra share (of the estate)? You and I must (rather) divide our father's house equally." They entered upon legal proceedings before King Niqmepa. Abiadu declared in testimony before King Niqmepa the king that Bittatti held (rights to) a share in the estate. The king thereupon declared: "Let Abba'el take as his preferential share that (portion of) the house which he pleases; Bittatti shall then take that (portion of the) house which he declines." That is what the king declared.
Gimil-Addu and Niwariadu, [officials] of the Throne were detailed to arrange the division of the house. Abba'el took as his preferred share the upper house with loft; the lower house he left (text: gave) for his sister, Bittatti. From this day henceforward Abba'el may not re-institute proceedings against Bittatti—nor Bittatti against Abba'el —with respect to the house which is the portion of Bittatti. Whichever (of them) does open such proceedings will pay into the palace five hundred shekels of gold and will forfeit his portion of the estate.

If the restoration in line 9 is accepted, it suggests that Abba'el had taken possession of the entire "house," was thereupon challenged by his sister who wanted to recover her share, and that the suit was brought against her by the former on a "cease and desist" bans. Alternatively, the sense may be that B. claims that A. had already taken his "extra share" (presumably as the primary heir) of the estate in the property located in Suharuwa, and had no right to complete possession of the "villa" under dispute. Note that throughout this text the word "house" (Akkadian bitu) might also have been rendered "(real-)estate," but the conclusion of the text makes it dear that it was a specific property which was at issue, consisting of a dwelling complex containing more than one "house," in other words, a "villa."

Asiatics in Egyptian
Household Service
In the Thirteenth Dynasty (mid-eighteenth century B.C.) there is evidence for the presence of numerous Asiatics serving in Egyptian households. Whether they should specifically be called "slaves" is not certain, even if probable. Since there is no contemporaneous evidence for military capture of Asiatics, the Joseph story (Gen. 37:28, 36) may supply the solution, in a trade in Asiatics carried on by Asiatics themselves. The present text deals with more than eighty servants of a single Theban household, of w h o m more than forty are stated to be Asiatic. There are many more women than men. Among the males are "house-men," cooks, a brewer, and a tutor(?). T h e majority of the women worked in the weaving rooms. T h e adults are usually listed with an Asiatic name, followed by an Egyptian name. Again the analogy of Joseph's two names seems apt. O n e Asiatic has only an Egyptian name, followed by the entry: "It is his name." TTie children usually have only an Egyptian name. Were they born in bondage? The basic publication is William C. Hayes, A Papyrus of the Late Middle Kingdom in the Brooklyn Museum [Papyrus Brooklyn 35.1446] (Brooklyn Museum, 1955). A m o n g the chief commentaries are those by W . F . Albright, J AOS, LXXIV (1955), 222-33, a n d G. Posener, Syria, x x x i v (1957), 145-63.

T h e W a r against the Hyksos
(Continued)
It is a fortunate chance that provides a new discovery which continues a known inscription. Ka-mose's attack on the Hyksos was first known through a schoolboy's tablet and then brought into monumental compass in the fragments of a stela (pp. 23233). It now appears that that stela was the first of a pair erected at Karnak. In 1954, among the foundation slabs used under statues at Karnak, Labib Habachi discovered an essentially complete stela, which gives the continuation and conclusion of the Ka-mose story. T h e stela is of the conventional shape, with a rounded top and the winged sun disk above. However, the first line simply continues a context from the lost final lines of the stela previously known. In a corner of the base is carved the figure of a man, with the label, "the Chief Treasurer Neshi" (also mentioned in 1. 37 of the text). Published by L. Habachi, ASAE, LIII (1956), 195-202; and M.

T h e Dedication of the
Shamash Temple by
Yahdun-Lim
On nine bricks found by A. Parrot in 1953 in Mari, we have the longest brick inscription ever to come out of Mesopotamian soil, 147 to 157 lines in five columns. It contains the dedication of die temple of Shamash by Yahdun-Lim, the father of ZimriLim, after his campaign to the Mediterranean Sea and the defeat of an alliance of nomadic enemies. Publication: G. Dossin, "L'inscription de fondation de Iahdun-Lim, roi de Mari" in Syria, XXXII (1935), pp. 1-28, Plates 1 and 2. Literature: A . Malamat, "Campaigns to the Mediterranean by Iahdunlim and other early Mesopotamian rulers" in AS, xvi (1965), pp. 365-372, especially pp. 367 ff.
(i) (Dedicated) to Shamash, the king of the heaven and the nether world, who pronounces orders and decisions for god and man, whose office is (the dispensation of) justice and to whom it has been given (to protect) what is right, the shepherd of all the black-headed, the famous god, judge of everything endowed with life, agreeable to supplication, ready to listen to vows, to accept prayers, who gives to those who worship him a longlasting life of happiness, the overlord of Mari, (by) Yahdun-Lim, the son of Yag(g)id-Lim, king of (the city of) Mari and of the Hana country, who digs canals, builds city walls, erects stelae mentioning (his) name, provides his people with superabundance, furnishes his country with everything (needed), the mighty king, the famous hero, on the occasion when Shamash was agreeable to his supplication and listened to his prayer. Indeed, Shamash did promptly come to the aid of Yahdun-Lim and while no other king residing in Mari had ever—since, in ancient days, the god built the city of Mari—reached the (Mediterranean) Sea, (ii) nor reached and felled timber in the great mountains, the Cedar Mountain and the Boxwood Mountain, he, Yahdun-Lim, son of Ya(g)gid-Lim, the powerful king, the wild bull among the kings, did march to the shore of the sea, an unrivaled feat, and offered sacrifices to the Ocean as (befitting) his high royal rank1 while his troops washed themselves in the Ocean. He (also) entered the great mountains, the Cedar Mountain and the Boxwood Mountain, and felled such trees as boxwood, cedar, cypress, and elammak]{u-Xxt&%. He made (this) razzia, established (thus) his fame and proclaimed his power. He subjected

that (entire) region on the shore of the Ocean, united it under (his) command, made it furnish him troops, (iii) He imposed a permanent tribute upon it and they are still bringing him their tribute. In that same year the following kings rebelled against him: La'um, king of Samanum and the country of the Ubrabians, Bahlu-kulim, king of Tuttul and of the country Amnanum, Ajalum, the king of Abattum and the country of the Rabbeans; an army of Sumu-epuh from the country of Jamhad came to their help, in the town of Samanum, they all gathered against him, the center of nomads,2 (but) he (Yahdun-Lim) defeated these three kings of the nomads in a big battle. He routed their army and the army who had come to their help, made a massacre (among them). (Then) he erected piles of their corpses. He razed the walls of their (cities), turning them into mounds of rubble. The city of Haman (belonging to) the center of the Haneans, which all the sheikhs of Hana had built, he razed and (iv) made into mounds of rubble. He also defeated its king, Kasuri-hala, annexed their (the Haneans') country. Then he built up the embankment of the Euphrates8 (in Mari) and erected (there) the temple of his lord Shamash for his (own) well-being; he made for him (Shamash) a temple of perfect construction in every aspect of craftsmanship, befitting his godhead, and installed him in this magnificent abode. He named this temple: Egirzalanki (which means): "The-temple-whichis-the-pride-of-Heaven-and-Nether-World." May Shamash who resides in this temple grant for ever to Yahdun-Lim, who built his temple, his beloved king, a mighty weapon (able) to defeat the enemies, a long and happy rule and everlasting years of abundance and happiness. Whoever desecrates this temple, assigns* it to evil and untoward purposes, does not reinforce its foundation, does not replace what has fallen down or (v) stops the food offerings (destined) for it, erases my name (in this inscription)—or gives orders for erasing it—, inscribes his own name not previously inscribed—or gives orders

3 T h e proposed translation of \ilad Purailim tgmurma gamir fcsdd Purattim is based on the passage in another inscription of the same king (RA, XXXIII, p. 50, i 7 f.) which speaks of the repair work done on the embankment of the Euphrates. 4 The signs i-ku-pu-Sum cannot refer to a verb "abandonner," nor to qdpu.

Ea, the master (lit.: king) of fates, should make his fate a bad one; the great lady, Aja the Bride, should forever represent his case in a bad light before Shamash; Bunene, the great plenipotentiary of Shamash, should end his life, eliminate every offspring of his, so that neither descendant nor progeny of his should ever live under the sun (text: Sun god).
T h e Story of Idrimi,
King of Alalakh
Found in 1939 at Atchana in Syria, the statue showing K i n g Idrimi of Alalakh seated on his throne was not published until 1949 because of war conditions. An inscription of 101 lines indiscriminately covers the front of the figure, with a postscript of three lines incised on one side of the beard and whiskers. Publication: Sidney Smith, The Statue of Idrimi (London, 1949), pp. 14-23, with extensive commentary and a study of the historic background. Literature: W. F. Albright, BASOR, 118 (1950), pp. 14-20; A. Goetze, JCS, xrv (1950), pp. 226-231; J. Nougayrol, RA, XLV (1951), pp. 151-154; B. Landsberger, JCS, VIII (1954), pp. 54-55. T h e present translation is to a considerable extent provisional since obviously a new edition of the text based on collations is needed to ascertain the correctness or probability of the numerous emendations and corrections proposed in the literature on the inscription. I have often accepted suggestions made by other scholars but these as well as my own attempts to extract meaning and continuity from the awkward formulation of the text are in need of confirmation. Words for which I did not dare offer even tentative translations are replaced by three dots. I have refrained from adding footnotes in support of my o w n translations because they would have been too numerous and too technical and, in the long run, would not have made the translations any more convincing. My purpose has been solely to add new guesses to the old ones and to aim at a readable translation capable of carrying what I consider the basic intent and mood of the original.

My brothers, who were older than I, stayed with me but none of them had the plans I had. I (said to) myself: "Whoever owns the

(So) I took with me my horse, my chariot, and my groom, went away and crossed over the desert country and even entered into the region of the Sutian warriors. I stayed with them (once) overnight in my . . . chariot, but the next day I moved on and went to the land of Canaan. I stayed in Ammia in the land of Caanan; in Ammia lived (also) natives of Halab, of the country Mukishkhi, of the country Ni' and also warriors from the country Ama'e. They discovered that I was the son of their overlord and gathered around me. There I grew up and stayed for a long time. For seven years I lived among the Hapiru-people. (Then) I released birds2 (to observe their flight) and looked into (the entrails of) lambs (and found) that after seven years Adad had become favorable to me. So I built boats, made . . . soldiers board them, approached the country Mukishkhi via the sea and reached shore below Mt. Casius.31 went ashore and when my country heard of me they brought me cattle and sheep. And in one day, and as one man, the countries Ni', Ama'e, Mukishkhi and my city Alalakh turned to me. My brothers heard (about this) and they came into my presence. As soon as they had become reconciled with me, I established my brothers as such. However, for seven years, Barattarna, the mighty king, the king of the Hurrian warriors, treated me as an enemy. In the seventh year, I sent Anuanda (as messenger) to King Barattarna, the king of the (Hurrian) warriors, and told (him) about the services of my forefathers when my forefathers had been in their (the kings') service and (when) what we had said was pleasing to the kings of the Hurrian warriors, and (that) they had made an alliance based on a solemn oath among themselves. The mighty king heard of our former services and of the oath they had sworn to each other—they had read the wording of the oath to him, word by word as well as (the list of) our services. He accepted my messenger (lit.: my greeting). I increased the gifts indicating my loyalty, which were heavy, and returned to him (his) lost household. I swore him a mighty oath as to my status as a loyal vassal. And (so) I became king in charge of Alalakh. Kings from right and left came up to me and just as they used to bring presents upon presents for my forefather in . . . , I had them bring (them to me) in . . . . And I . . . ed them.4

The country of the Hittites did not mobilize (its troops), did not march against me, I could do what I wanted. I took prisoners from them, plundered their riches, possessions, and property, and distributed it to my soldiers, my auxiliary troops, my brothers, and friends. I myself took a share like theirs. Then I returned to the country of Mukishkhi and entered (in triumph) into my city Alalakh. I had a house built by means of the prisoners, the provisions, riches, possessions and property which I had brought down from the country of the Hittites; I made my throne like the throne of kings, my brothers like brothers of kings, my children like their children, and my guardsmen like their guardsmen.

The Banquet of
Ashurnasirpal II
On a sandstone block placed near the doorway to the throneroom of the palace of Ashurnasirpal in Calah was found in 1951 a figural representation with an inscription (total: 154 lines) in an unusual arrangement The upper part of the stone shows the king in a square recess, flanked by inscribed columns, under an awkwardly arranged row of divine symbols. The text, apart from its stereotyped titulary and historical summary, is mainly concerned with the building of the new capital Calah, the royal
garden and the festival in celebration of the opening of the royal palace. While such ceremonies are repeatedly mentioned in Assyrian royal inscriptions (cf. Altorientalische Bibliothek^ 1, p. 124, iv 26 [Shalm. I ] ; H. Winckler, Die Keilschrifttexte Sargons . . . , PL 38, iii 37 ff.; R. Borger, Die Inschriften Asarhaddons, Königs von Assyrien, p. 63, Episode 23:49 £F.; D. D. Luckenbill, The Annals of Sennacherib, p. 116, viii 74 ff.), our text is unique in giving us not only an enumeration of the foodstuffs used (inclusive of quantities) but also the number and provenience of the guests. Publication: D. J. Wiseman, "A N e w Stela of Assur-nasir-pal II" in Iraq, xrv (1952), pp. 24-44, Plates 2-6.
(i) (This is) the palace of Ashurnasirpal, the high priest of Ashur, chosen by Enlil and Ninurta, the favorite of Anu and of Dagan (who is) destruction (personified) among all the great gods—the legitimate king, the king of the world, the king of Assyria, son of Tukulti-Ninurta, great king, legitimate king, king of the world, king of Assyria (who was) the son of Adad-nirari, likewise great king, legitimate king, king of the world and king of Assyria—the heroic warrior who always acts upon trustinspiring signs given by his lord Ashur and (therefore) has no rival among the rulers of the four quarters (of the world); the shepherd of all mortals, not afraid of battle (but) an onrushing Rood which brooks no resistance; the king who subdues the unsubmissive (and) rules over all mankind; the king who always acts upon trust-inspiring signs given by his lords, the great gods, and therefore has personally conquered all countries; who has acquired dominion over the mountain regions and received their tribute; he takes hostages, triumphs over all the countries from beyond the Tigris to the Lebanon and the Great Sea, he has brought into submission the entire country of Laqe and the region of Suhu as far as the town of Rapiqu; personally he conquered (the region) from the source of the Subnat River to Urartu. I returned to the territory of my own country (the regions) from the pass (which leads to) the country Kirrure as far as Gilzani, from beyond the Lower Zab River to the town of Til-bari which is upstream of the land of Zamua—from Til-sha-abtani to Til-sha-sabtani(also) Hirimu and Harrutu (in) the fortified border region of Babylonia (Karduniash). I listed as inhabitants of my own country (the people living) from the pass of Mt. Babite to the land of Hashmar. Ashur, the Great Lord, has chosen me and made a pronouncement concerning my world rule with his own holy mouth (as follows): Ashurnasirpal is the king whose fame is power!1 I took over again the city of Calah in that wisdom of mine, the knowledge which Ea, the king of the subterranean waters, has bestowed upon me, I removed the old hill of rubble; I dug down to the water level; I

heaped up a (new) terrace (measuring) from the water level to the upper edge 120 layers of bricks; upon that I erected as my royal seat and for my personal enjoyment 7 (text: 8) beautiful halls (roofed with) boxwood, Magan-ash, cedar, cypress, terebinth, tarpi'u and mehru (beams); I sheathed doors made of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood and Magan-ash with bands of bronze; I hung them in their doorways; I surrounded them (the doors) with decorative bronze bolts; to proclaim my heroic deeds I painted on their (the palaces') walls with vivid blue paint how I have marched across the mountain ranges, the foreign countries and the seas, my conquests in all countries;2 I had lapis lazuli colored glazed bricks made and set (them in the wall) above their gates. I brought in people from the countries over which I rule, those who were conquered by me personally, (that is) from the country Suhi (those of) the town Great [ . . . ] , from the entire land of Zamua, the countries BitZamani and [Kir]rure, the town of Sirqu which is across the Euphrates, and many inhabitants of Laqe, of Syria and (who are subjects) of Lubarna, the ruler of Hattina; I settled them therein (the city of Calah). I dug a canal from the Upper Zab River; I cut (for this purpose) straight through the mountain(s); I called it Patti-hegalli ("Channel-of-Abundance"); I provided the lowlands along the Tigris with irrigation; I planted orchards at its (the city's) outskirts, with all sorts of fruit trees. I pressed the grapes and offered (them) as first fruits in a libation to my lord Ashur and to all the sanctuaries of my country. I (then) dedicated that city to my lord Ashur. [I collected and planted in my garden] from the countries through which I marched and the mountains which I crossed, the trees (and plants raised from) seeds from wherever I discovered (them, such as): cedars, cypress, limmesallu-ptrivime. trees, £wrtf/«-junipers, myrrh-producing trees, dapranu-junipers, nut-bearing trees, date palms, ebony, Magan-ash, olive trees, tamarind, oaks, iarpi'tt-terebinth trees, /«^«-nut-bearing trees, pistachio and cornel-trees, mehru-trees, sE.MUR-trees, tijatu-trees, Kanish oaks, willows, saddnu-trees, pomegranates, plum

In the gardens in [Calah] they vied with each other in fragrance; the paths i[n the gardens were well fept], the irrigation weirs [distributed the water evenly]; its pomegranates glow in the pleasure garden like the stars in the sky, they are interwoven like grapes on the vine;

(ii)
I erected in Calah, the center of my overlordship, temples such as those of Enlil and Ninurta which did not exist there before; I rebuilt in it the (following) temples of the great gods: the temples of Ea-sharru (and) Damkina, of Adad (and) Shala, of Gula, Sin, Nabu, Beletnathi, Sibittu (and of) Ishtar-kidmuri. In them I established the (sacred) pedestals of the(se), my divine lords. I decorated them splendidly; I roofed them with cedar beams, made large cedar doors, sheathed them with bands of bronze, placed them in their doorways. I placed figural representations made of shining bronze in their doorways. I made (the images of) their great godheads sumptuous with red gold and shining stones. I presented them with golden jewelry and many other precious objects which I had won as booty. I lined the inner shrine of my lord Ninurta with gold and lapis lazuli, I placed right and left of it IM8 objects made of bronze, I placed at his pedestal fierce ulumgalludragons of gold. I performed his festival in the months Shabatu and Ululu. I arranged for them (the materials needed for) scatter and incense offerings so that his festival in Shabatu should be one of great display. I fashioned a statue of myself as king in the likeness of my own features out of red gold and polished stones and placed it before my lord Ninurta. I organized the abandoned towns which during the rule of my fathers had become hills of rubble, and had many people settle therein; I rebuilt the old palaces across my entire country in due splendor; I stored in them barley and straw. Ninurta and Palil, who love me as (their) high priest, handed over to me all the wild animals and ordered me to hunt (them). I killed 450 big lions; I killed 390 wild bulls from my open chariots in direct assault as befits a ruler; I cut off the heads of 200 ostriches as if they were caged birds; I caught 30 elephants in pitfalls. I caught alive 50 wild bulls, 140 ostriches (and) 20 big lions with my own [. . .] and stave.
(in) I received five live elephants as tribute from the governor of Suhu (the Middle Euphrates region) and the governor of Lubda (S.E. Assyria toward Babylonia); they used to travel with me on my campaigns.4 I organized herds of wild bulls, lions, ostriches and

When Ashurnasirpal, king of Assyria, inaugurated the palace in Calah, a palace of joy and (erected with) great ingenuity, he invited into it Ashur, the great lord and the gods of his entire country, (he prepared a banquet5 of) 1,000 fattened head of cattle, 1,000 calves, /0,000 stable sheep, 15,000 lambs—for my lady Ishtar (alone) 200 head of cattle (and) 1,000 sihh«-sheep—1,000 spring lambs, 500 stags, 500 gazelles, 1,000 ducks, 500 geese, 500 ^«r^«-geese, 1,000 mesu\u-birds, 1,000 qaribu-buds, 10,000 doves, 10,000 su\anunu-doves, 10,000 other (assorted) small birds, 10,000 (assorted) fish, 10,000 jerboa, 10,000 (assorted) eggs; 10,000 loaves of bread, 10,000 (jars of) beer, 10,000 skins with wine, 10,000 pointed bottom vessels with /«'«-seeds in sesame oil, 10,000 small pots with sarh«-condiment, 1,000 wooden crates with vegetables, 300 (containers with) oil, 300 (containers with) salted seeds, 300 (containers with) mixed raqqute-pXznts, 100 with \udimmu-spice, 100 (containers with) . . . , 100 (containers with) parched barley, 100 (containers with) green abahsinn«-stalks, 100 (containers with) fine mixed beer, 100 pomegranates, 100 bunches of grapes, 100 mixed zamru-iruits, 100 pistachio cones, 100 with the fruits of the /«//-tree, 100 with garlic, 100 with onions, 100 with \uniphu (seeds), 100 with the . . . of turnips, 100 with hinhinnu-spice, 100 with budu-spice, 100 with honey, 100 with rendered butter, 100 with roasted . . . barley, 100 with roasted /«'«-seeds, 100 with ^ar^arta-plants, 100 with fruits of the ti'atu-tree, 100 with ^<«i2-plants, 100 with milk, 100 with cheese, 100 jars with "mixture," 100 with pickled arsuppu-grain, ten homer of shelled luddunuts, ten homer of shelled pistachio nuts, ten homer of fruits of the /«/«-tree, ten homer of fruits of the habbaququ-tree, ten homer of dates, ten homer of the fruits of the titip-tree, ten homer of cumin, ten homer of sahhunu, ten homer of urianu, ten homer of andahsu-bulbs, ten homer of i//a*z/££?-plants, (iv) ten homer of the fruits of the simburu-tree, ten homer of thyme, ten homer of perfumed oil, ten homer of sweet smelling matters, ten homer of . . . , ten homer of the fruits of the nasubu-trtt, ten homer of zimzimm«-onions, ten homer of olives.

The Mother of Nabonidus
On two stelae found in Harran, one in 1906 and one as recently as 1956, we have what appears, stylistically, as a tomb inscription of the mother of Nabonidus. T h e fact that two such objects are found in proximity seems, however, to suggest that they represent some atypical form of memorial tablets, since these stelae were placed, together with two likewise identical stelae of Nabonidus himself (see p. 562), in an architecturally oriented arrangement in or near the temple in Harran, the reconstruction of which is clearly the main concern of both texts. T h e present translation is based on the stela called Hi B by G a d d (see below) because it is better preserved and more complete than the stela found and first published by H. Pognon ( H X A according to Gadd). Publication: C. J. Gadd, "The Harran Inscription of Nabonidus" in AnSt, VIII (1958), pp. 35-92, especially pp. 56-65. T h e older stela has been treated most recently by B. Landsberger, "Die Basaltstela Nabonids von Eski-Harran" in Halil Edhem Hatha Kitabi (Ankara, 1947), pp. 115-151, Plates 1-3 (with literature on earlier discussion ibid., p. 120 f.). Literature: For studies dealing with the historical background of this stela, see the literature cited sub p. 311.

For whatever precious possessions they have given me, I than\ed them with gifts day and night for months and years. I laid hold of the hem of the garment of Sin, the king of all gods, my eyes were directed toward him day and night; I bowed down before him(!) in prayers and

prostrations, saying: "If you would return to your city, all the black-headed people would worship your great godhead!" In order to appease (the anger of) my personal god and goddess, I did not permit apparel made of fine wool, gold and silver jewelry, any new garment, perfumes, and scented oil to touch my body, I was clad in a torn garment and when I left (my house) it was in silence, I constantly pronounced benedictions for them, the praise of my personal god and goddess was in my thoughts and I performed the services for them. I did not spare whatever precious possession I had but brought it to them (as votive offering). From the 20th year of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, when I was born, until the 42nd year of Ashurbanipal, the 3rd year of his son Ashur-etil-ili, the 21st year of Nabopolassar, the 43rd year of Nebuchadnezzar, the 2nd year of Awel-Merodach, the 4th year of Neriglissar, during (all) these 95 years in which I visited the temple of the great godhead of Sin, the king of all the gods in heaven and in the nether world, he looked with favor upon my pious good works and listened to my prayers, accepted my vows. (Eventually) his wrathful heart quieted down and he became reconciled with the temple Ehulhul, the temple of Sin in Harran, the divine residence in which his heart rejoices, and he had a change of heart. Sin, the king of all the gods, looked with favor upon me and called Nabonidus, my only son, whom I bore, to kingship and entrusted him with the kingship of Sumer and Akkad, (also of) all the countries from the border of Egypt, on the Upper Sea, to the Lower Sea. Then I lifted my hands to Sin, the king of all the gods, [I asked] reverently and in a pious mood: (ii) "Since you have called to kingship [Nabonidus, my son, whom I bore, the beloved of his mother,] and have elevated his status, let all the other gods—upon your great divine command—help him (and) make him defeat his enemies, do (also) bring to completion the (re)building of the temple Ehulhul and the performance of its ritual!" In a dream Sin, the king of all the gods, put his hands on me saying: "The gods will return on account of you! I will entrust your son, Nabonidus, with the divine residence of Harran; he will (re)build the temple Ehulhul and complete this task. He will restore and make Harran more (beautiful) than it was before! He will lead Sin, Ningal, Nusku and Sadarnunna in solemn procession into the temple Ehulhul!" I heeded the words which Sin, the king of all the gods, had spoken to me and I saw (them come true). Nabonidus, the only son whom I bore, performed indeed all the forgotten rites of Sin, Ningal, Nusku and Sadarnunna, he completed the rebuilding of the temple Ehulhul, led Sin, Ningal, Nusku and Sadarnunna in procession from Babylon (Shuanna), his royal city, installed (them again)

in gladness and happiness into Harran, the seat which pleases them. Out of his love for me who worships him and have laid hold to the hem of his garment, Sin, the king of all gods, did what he had not done before, had not granted to anybody else, he gave me (a woman) an exalted position and a famous name in the country. He added (to my life) many days (and) years of happiness and kept me alive from the time of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, to the 9th year of Nabonidus, king of Babylon, the son whom I bore, (i.e.) one hundred and four happy years (spent) in that piety which Sin, the king of all gods, has planted in my heart. My eyesight was good (to the end of my life), my hearing excellent, my hands and feet were sound, my words well chosen, food and drink agreed with me, my health was fine and my mind happy. I saw my great-great-grandchildren, up to the fourth generation, in good health and (thus) had my fill of old age. Let me entrust to you, Sin, my lord, my son Nabonidus, king of Babylon ( N U N " ) (since) you have looked upon me with favor and have given me (such) a long life; he should not sin against you as long as he lives. Assign to him the favorable sedu and lamassu protective spirits whom you have assigned to me and who have made me reach ripe old age. Do not forgive him (easily) Kis trespassing and sins against your great godhead, may he (always) be in awe of your great godhead. I have obeyed with all my heart and have done my duty (as a subject) during the 21 years in which Nabopolassar, the king of Babylon, the 43 years in which Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, and the four years in which Neriglissar, the king of Babylon, exercised their kingship, (altogether) 68 years; I have made Nabonidus, the son whom I bore, serve Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, and Neriglissar, king of Babylon, and he performed his duty for them day and night by doing always what was their pleasure. He also made me a good name before them and they gave me an elevated position as if I were their real daughter, (break) And (for this reason) I have been making funerary offerings for them, performing and instituting for them permanent incense offerings, abundant (and) of sweet smell. (Postscript:) She died a natural death in the 9th year of Nabonidus, king of Babylon. Nabonidus, king of Babylon, the son whom she bore, laid her body to rest [wrapped in] fine [wool garments and] shining white linen. He deposited her body in a hidden tomb with splendid [ornaments] of gold [set with] beautiful stones, [ . . . ] stones, expensive stone beads, [containers with] scented oil, and [..·]· He slaughtered fat rams and assembled into his presence [the inhabitants] of Babylon and Borsippa together with [people] from far off provinces, he [summoned even kings, princes] and

Nabonidus and His God
In 1956 D. S. Rice discovered in the ruins of the Great Mosque in Harran two stelae of Nabonidus used there secondarily as paving stones. Both are in typical stela form ending in a semicircle which contains in bas-relief the figure of the king in adoration before the symbols of the Sun, Ishtar, and the Moon. The lower part of each monolith contains the inscription in three columns of about 50 lines. Publication: C. J.

1 The reading [w]e(!)-e-du instead of [ D U M ] U ( I ) e-du (see ZA,
LVI, 219, n. 7), "only son," seems to be required by the context. The
latter expression occurs only when the mother of Nabonidus speaks of
him, while the king stresses here the fact that he was alone and with
out friends.
heart was no thought of kingship, the gods and goddesses prayed (to Sin) and Sin called me to kingship. At midnight he (Sin) made me have a dream and said (in the dream) as follows: "Rebuild speedily Ehulhul, the temple of Sin in Harran, and I will hand over to you all the countries." But the citizens of Babylon, Borsippa, Nippur, Ur, Uruk (and) Larsa, the administrators (and) the inhabitants of the urban centers of Babylonia acted evil, careless and even sinned against his great divine power, having not (yet) experienced the awfulness of the wrath of the Divine Crescent, the king of all gods; they disregarded his (text: their) rites and there was much irreligious and disloyal talk. They devoured one another like dogs, caused disease and hunger to appear among them. He (Sin) decimated the inhabitants of the country, but he made me leave my city Babylon on the road to Tema, Dadanu, Padakku, Hibra, Jadihu even as far as Jatribu.2 For ten years I was moving around among these (cities) and did not enter my own city Babylon. Upon the order of Sin, the king of all gods, the lord of lords, which the gods and goddesses living in heaven (then) executed, upon the order of the Divine Crescent, Sin, they appointed Shamash, Ishtar, Adad and Nergal to watch over my well-being. (Thereupon) in one and the same year3 (twice), to wit in the month of Nisannu as well as Tashritu, the people of Babylonia and Upper Syria could collect the products of the (open) country and the sea, and throughout all these years, without exception, Adad, the dike warden of heaven and nether world provided them upon the command of Sin with rain even in the height of the summer, in the following months: Simanu, Du'uzi, Abu (and) Ululu, and so they could bring me (in order to support me) their abundance without hardship.4 Upon the command of Sin «and» Ishtar, the Lady-of-Battle, without whom neither hostilities nor reconciliation can occur in the country and no battle can be fought, extended her protection (lit.: hand) over them, and the king of Egypt, the Medes and the land of the Arabs, all the hostile kings, were sending me messages of reconciliation and friendship. As to the land of the Arabs which [is the eternal enemy] of Babylonia [and which] was (always) ready to rob and carry off its possession, (ii) Nergal broke their weapons upon the order of Sin, and they all bowed down at my feet. Shamash, the lord of oracular decisions, without whom no prediction can be uttered (lit.: no mouth can be

Gadd, AnSt, vm, p. 80 if. 3 Thus I propose to translate ina latti salu because the reference is not to one miraculous event but to a series of such incidents (see ina lanati annati in line 35) in which abnormal rainfall occurred. * The phrase ina iulum seems to indicate that Nabonidus intended to stress here the fact that he was living off the country during his exile, but that through the intervention of Adad which produced abundant rain, the inhabitants could support him without undue hardship to themselves.

opened or shut), made, in execution of a command of his own father, the Divine Crescent, the words and the hearts of the people of Babylonia and Upper Syria, who are in my charge, turn (again) to me so that they began to serve me and to execute my command throughout all the distant mountain regions and inaccessible paths I was moving about. Then the (predicted) term of ten years arrived, it happened on the very day which the king of the gods, the Divine Crescent, had (in the dream) predicted, i.e., the 17th day of Tashritu, of which it is said (in the hemerologies): a day on which Sin is gracious. O Sin, lord of the gods, whose name on the first day (of his appearance) is "Weapon-of-Anu," (you) who are able to illuminate (lit.: touch with light all) the heaven and to crush the nether world,6 who hold in your (text: the) hands the power of the Anu-oflice, who wield all the power of the Enlil-office, who have taken over the power of the Ea-office, holding thus in your (text: his) own hand all the heavenly powers; Enlil among the gods, king of kings, lord of lords, whose command they do not contradict, you who do not have to repeat your (text: his) order, of whose great awe the heaven and the nether world are full, with whose sheen heaven and nether world are covered—who can do anything without you? You place religious awe of your great godhead in the heart of any country in which you desire to dwell and its foundation remains steadfast forever; you remove awe toward you from any country which you choose to destroy and you overthrow it forever. ( Y ° u ) a r e the one whose utterance all the gods and goddesses living in heaven observe; they execute the command of the Divine Crescent, their own father, who wields the powers of heaven and nether world, without whose exalted command, which is given in heaven every day, no country can rest in security and no light can be in the world; the gods shake like reeds and the Anunnaki quiver; those who [bow down] before his divine command which cannot be changed . . .

[Before that moment] my visits to the diviner (or) the dream expert [for the interpretation of signs] did not cease, (but) whenever I lay down to sleep, (my) dreams at night were confused, until the word [came true, the time] was full, the right moment had arrived which [Sin had foretold]. [Then I dispatched a messenger] from Tema [and he went to] Babylon, my lordly city. When they saw [him .. . ] they took gifts and presents be[fore him], the kings of the nearby regions came up (to Babylon) to kiss his (text: my) feet and those far off heard (about it) and were filled with awe of his (Sin's) great divine power.

withdrawn returned to give blessings. Then, my good fortune was found (again) in the victims used for the decisions of the diviner. I arranged for my followers in the distant mountain regions (to live) in great plenty and abundance and I myself took the road home undisturbed. (Thereupon) I carefully executed the command of his (Sin's) great godhead, I was not careless nor negligent but set in motion people from Babylon and Upper Syria, from the border of Egypt on the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, all those whom Sin, the king of the gods, had entrusted to me, (thus) I built anew the Ehulhul, the temple of Sin, and completed this work. I (then) led in procession Sin, Ningal, Nusku and Sadarnunna, from Shuanna (in Babylon), my royal city, and brought (them) in joy and happiness (into the temple), installing them on a permanent dais. I made abundant offerings before them and lavished gifts (on them). I filled Ehulhul with happiness and made its personnel rejoice. (Thus) I fulfilled the command of Sin, the king of the gods, the lord of lords who dwells in heaven, whose name surpasses that of (all) the (other) gods in heaven, (i.e.) of Shamash, who is installed by him, Nusku, Ishtar, Adad (and) Nergal who have (only) executed the command of the Divine Crescent, who surpasses them (all). Whenever I armed myself with weapons and set my mind to do batde, it was (solely) to execute the command of the Divine Crescent (hence) whoever you be whom Sin will (later on) name to kingship and whom he will call "My son," [do visit] the sacred places of Sin, who dwells in heaven [whose command cannot be changed] and whose order needs no [repetition] and [he will assist you] with his weapon in [battle . . . ].
T h e Conquest of Jerusalem
From the tablet which deals with the period from the last (21st) year of Nabopolassar to the eleventh year of his son and successor Nebuchadnezzar II, the section reporting on the events before and after the conquest of Jerusalem has been translated here. The preceding years saw the conquest of Hatti land by Nabopolassar and his son's annual campaigns through the West (conquest of Askelon, first year), the subsequent campaign against Elam (Year 9), a short rebellion (Year 10) and more campaigns in Hatti land.

Year 4: The king of Akkad sent out his army and marched into Hatti land. [They marched] unopposed through Hatti land. In the month of Kislimu he took the lead of his army and marched toward Egypt. The king of Egypt heard (of it) and sent out his army; they clashed in an open battle and inflicted heavy losses on each other. The king of Akkad and his army turned back and [returned] to Babylon. Year 5: The king of Akkad (stayed) in his country. He organized his chariots and many horses. Year 6, month Kislimu: The king of Akkad moved his army into Hatti land. He dispatched his army from Hatti land, they raided the desert, took much booty from the land of the Arabs, (also) their herds and divine images in great number. In the month Addaru, the king returned to his country. Year 7, month Kislimu: The king of Akkad moved his army into Hatti land, laid siege to the city of Judah (Ia-a-hu-du) and the king took the city on the second day of the month Addaru. He appointed in it a (new) king of his liking, took heavy booty from it and brought it into Babylon.

T h e Assyrian King List
There are three copies extant (apart from the small fragment KAV, 15) of the composition known today as " T h e Assyrian King List"; one was published by E. Nassouhi, "Grande Liste des rois d'Assyrie" in AfO, iv (1927), pp. 1-11, the two others by I. J. Gelb, " T w o Assyrian K i n g Lists" in JNES, xm (1954), pp. 209-30. T h e first comes from the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul (no reference to provenience known), the second from Khorsabad (DurSarru-kJn) and the third is deposited in the Seventh-Day Adventist Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C., and is likewise of unknown origin. While the shape of the Istanbul tablet cannot be ascertained because of its bad state of preservation, the other two tablets are clearly in the form of amulet texts (see Erica Reiner, JNES, xix, [i960], pp. 148 if.). T h e contents are practically the same in all these instances but for the fact that the tablets were written at different periods and hence the sequences of the Assyrian kings are brought to different points in time. Thus, the tablet from Istanbul ends with the year 935 B.C., the Khorsabad copy with 745 B.C., and the tablet from Washington with 722 B.C.
The tablets have been repeatedly studied with regard to their value as documents bearing on the history of Assyria, cf. A. Poebel, ' T h e Assyrian K i n g List from Khorsabad" in JNES, 1 (1942), pp. 247-306, 460-92; 11 (1943), pp. 59-60; I. J. Gelb in the aforementioned article; E. F.

1 T h e scribc uses, with the exception of the writings A-lik-sa-an-dar
and H-lip-su, abbreviations to refer to the kings. Thus Seleucus is
consistently written Si and Antiochus An, Demetrius Di and Arsaces,
probably, Ar; in line 5 Alexander is rendered by A-lik. The translation
uses the full names with the ordinals and the identifying Greek by
names for the convenience of the reader. 2 The text uses the geographical name Hani in this context which in
earlier Akkadian documents refers to Assyria. Since the king was killed
on the European side of the Bosporus, the name Hani seems to have
been used also to refer to the regions to the west of Assyria. See, how
ever, Sachs, Iraq, xvi, 206. ' T h e use of NAM.ME5 for "to die" is characteristic of the chronicle
style (see the "Synchronistic Chronicle") and underlines the continuity
pointed out by Sachs (Iraq, xvi, 202 f.) with respect to the Sumerian
formula mu x in.ag, "he ruled for x years." 4 The formulation here deviates from that in lines 7, 9, r. 8 and 10
so that it is very likely that the scribe intended to convey a special
nuance (possibly: he did not rule for full 15 years). •The repeated references to events which happened outside Babylon
by ittelme umma are quite unique; I know of no parallel.

6 Two dear but unintelligible signs (DIS IGI). 7 Attention should be drawn to the discussion and parallel passages offered by Sachs on p. 208. The latter show that the king was killed in the midst of his nobles called, respectively, L6.GAL.ME5 and A.SIG.

A Letter from the T i m e
of Josiah
In i960 J. Naveh excavated a fortress on the Mediterranean seven km. northwest of Jamnia and three km. south of the mouth of the Wadi Rubin (Nahal Soreq). The name then given the site turned out to be based on an erroneous reading of the ostracon in question. T h e life of the fortress could be dated within narrow limits by the typical iate pre-exilic and early Ionian (Southwest-Anatolian Greek) pottery found on the site, as well as by historical considerations, which suggest a date about 630 B.C. This would be just after the death of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal and before the occupation of the Philistine Plain by Psammetichus of Egypt T h e script of the ostracon is unfortunately quite slovenly, and it might be dated almost anywhere in the seventh century. The language is also uneven, and there are orthographic inconsistencies, but it is, in general, a fluent late pre-exilic Hebrew. For the original publication see J. Naveh in IE], x (i960), pp. 129-139, and IE], XII (1962), pp. 89-113, and among more recent treatments especially F. M. Cross, Jr., BASOR, 165 (1962), pp. 34-46, and S. Talmon, BASOR, 176 (1964), pp. 29-38. My own independent treatment was worked out with a class at the Hebrew Union College in April, 1961, but never published, since Cross had meanwhile been able to study the original, as well as a number of different photographs. The results of his careful collation were also placed at my disposal subsequently. The present translation diverges from that of Cross at a number of points, which are explained in the notes.

2 The context below indicates that the complainant was foreman of a small gang of men from a single town who were serving their tour of duty in the royal corvee. 3 In one of the photos I have, there are three clear horizontal parallel lines indicated in the supposed aleph, so I propose reading this name of a fortified town in the territory claimed by Simeon (e.g., I Chron. 4:31), which lay probably in the vicinity of Tell el-Far'ah (Sharuhen); see Abel, Geographic de la Palestine, 11, p. 344. This rich grain-producing area lay some forty miles south of Jamnia; both had been at that time in Philistine territory. 41 prefer Naveh's original interpretation for many reasons: harvesting grain was a relatively long process which varied in time according to latitude and elevation; measuring grain (for which mdd is regularly used, not k.wl) took no time at all and was evidendy included under 'sm. Cf. also Ruth 2:21, "until they have finished all my harvest." Since the text is damaged in the middle of line 6 we cannot be sure that it did not read ^[M] '(b)d\. 5 This cannot well be 'asam, "granary" (probably "grain pit"), but
may have been vocalized 'asim (like qdstr and 'dsif, etc., referring to
harvesting operations). •I propose vocalizing l(e-ySmam, literally "like daily."

Three Ostraca from Arad
During the excavation of the citadel mound of biblical Arad, in the extreme south of the hill country of Judah, south of Hebron and northeast of Beersheba, since 1962 hundreds of Hebrew and Aramaic ostraca have been found. T h e most important single find (1964) consisted of a group of seventeen ostraca, mostly in a good state of preservation, and probably all dating from shortly before the conquest of Judah by the Chaldaeans and their allies in the late winter of 598/97. T h i s date has subsequently been confirmed by the discovery of an ostracon mentioning steps which were to be taken against an expected Edomite raid. T h e value of the new material for political, administrative and especially religious history is considerable; it is exceeded only by the excavation of a local, but Yahwist sanctuary of the ninth-sixth centuries B.C. For publication of the three ostraca reinterpreted here see especially Aharoni, IE J, x v i (1966), pp. 1-7, and BASOR, 184 (1966), pp. 13 ff. For over-all accounts of the w o r k at Arad see especially Aharoni, The Biblical Archaeologist, x x x i (1968), 2
7 See above, n. 2. 8 Hoshaiah was presumably an inspector of forced labor. 9 Zeh can scarcely (in classical Hebrew) belong with the preceding word but it is quite common in the suggested usage, referring rather contemptuously to Hoshaiah. 10 The traces suggest that the scribe started to repeat the letter nun in naqeti and corrected it to qof. Certainly 'amen in both this sense and context has no parallel in Biblical Hebrew, while 'im is to be expected before we-im-16. 11 i.e., Hoshaiah. 12 If this were really the word 'amalle, as thought by Naveh and Talmon, following I Sam. 18:27, we should have to render it here, after the conjunction waw, "and I delivered (it) in full to the commander." See n. 13. 13 The probable meaning of this passage may be inferred from Micah 3:1 (as recognized also by Cross). 14 Reading probably lhi[pf[, i.e., le-hilldfef, "to discuss a (court) case with advisers"; cf. I Saim. 12:7. 15 For the construction of we-16 with following imperfect in jussive sense cf. I Kings 14:2, etc. (Gesenius-Kautzsch, Hebraische Gramma£\, $109 g. I agree with Naveh's original recognition of the verb dhm, "be dark," in Hebrew and cognate languages; cf. the meanings of Arabic dahama and adhama, to make (someone) unhappy, to grieve, displease." The reading we-16 tiddahennu, "but do not drive him away," does not reckon with the polite form of address to the commander, whose "servant" the suppliant is (especially at the beginning and end of the letter).

To my lord Eliashib:17 May Yahweh grant thy welfare!18 And (as) of now, give Shemariah half an aroura (of ground)19 and to Kerosi20 give a quarter aroura and to the sanctuary21 (give) what thou didst recommend to me. As for Shallum,22 he shall stay23 at the temple of Yahweh.24
18 Perhaps written by the secretary of a high official in Jerusalem to
the military commander of the southern mountain district. 17 Three seals of Eliashib son of Osh(i)yahu have also been exca
vated by Aharoni at Arad, and the same patronymic appears below in
Ostracon C. In my opinion there can be no reasonable doubt that the
proposed vocalization "Eshyahu" is wrong and that the name is
shortened from Ye'olyahu just as Konyahu (Coniah) was a short form
of Yekpnyahu (Jeconiah), personal name of king Jehoiachin. If this
is correct, Osh(i)yahu was king Josiah, and the southern commander
was brother of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, and uncle of the young king
Jeconiah, then probably on the throne. Josiah may have had many
more sons than are recorded. Another shortened form of the same name
was borne by Yaosh, military commander at Lachish a decade later,
but we do not know what relationship, if any, may have existed
between them.
13 This formula goes back at least to the Bronze Age (Amarna,
Taanach), but it already meant "grant welfare" not "ask for peace." 19 The Hebrews of the Monarchy used Egyptian hieratic numerals,
signs for weights and measures, etc.; see now Aharoni, BASOR, 184
(1966), pp. 13-19, and I. T. Kaufman, BASOR, 188 (1967), pp. 39
41. The hieratic symbol for half an aroura (an aroura was 100 cubits
square, so half an aroura would be about a quarter of an acre) is
identical with the Hebrew sign here (which has not yet been explained,
so far as I know); cf. the other new symbol in the following line,
which is blurred in the photo but may reflect the Egyptian hieratic
symbol for a quarter aroura (an eighth of an acre). The ground in
question could scarcely be inside the citadel; it may have been intended
for a house and garden. (Suggested by Hans Goedickc and George
Hughes.)
20 As pointed out by B. Mazar, Keroz was the name of a family of
temple servants, so Kerozt probably means "the Kerozite." In this case
Shemariah and Kerozi were presumably sent from Jerusalem to care
for the sanctuary service at Arad; cf. notes 21-24. 21 In view of the syntax and the difficulty of the first translation,
which presupposes a Hebrew that is both obscure and unidiomatic, I
have no hesitation in vocalizing we-lad-debir, referring to the sanctuary
excavated at Arad, which could indeed be a debir. 22 A number of men bearing this name are known to have lived
about this time, and the name was long popular in Israel. It had evi
dendy been decided that Shallum should stay on in Jerusalem, where
he was a priest or a temple servant, possibly identical with Jeremiah's
uncle or a contemporary "keeper of the threshold." 23 Certainly yeleb, "he shall dwell," probably used in the sense of
"he shall/will stay, as in Gen. 20:1, where the verb is used of Abra
ham's continued travel back and forth between Kadesh and the Wall
of the Prince along the frontier of Egypt. He could not "live" in the

desert of north-central Sinai, and he is expressly said to have had his home at Gerar in southern Palestine.
24 Undoubtedly the temple in Jerusalem, from which the letter must
have been sent to Arad. 25 This letter is an official memorandum, so the salutation is missing.
The apparent occasion for it is that the local mercenaries had been
complaining about the food and drink supplied them. 26 The term probably refers to mercenaries from the Aegean, like the
Cretans (Kretim) and Carians (Karim) mentioned in the Bible. The
term "islands (or coasdands) of the Kittim" which occurs several times
in the Bible, shows that they were not limited to Cyprus. In fact, I
have been deriving the name provisionally from Eg. Kftyw, with
roughly the same geographical extension. 27 This would be about 70 litres. 28 Literally "write the name of the day." 29 Almost certainly used of a good quality of wheat (such as the
durum used in making macaroni) as well as of the flour ground from
it. We have the same usage in modern Arabic qamh, "wheat," and the
word was already borrowed in Old Egyptian from Canaanite in a
similar sense. The reference to "what is left of the old wheat" suggests
the late winter just before Jerusalem fell to the Chaldaeans (15/16
March, 597 B . C . ) . 30 Surely this word is merely denominative from re^eb, "upper
millstone." 31 The suggested "ephah" would amount to only half a bushel or
so, which is incredibly low. A \or or homer (originally a donkey load)
would amount to about three or four bushels. Since a bushel of wheat
weighs about 60 lbs. it could scarcely have been a full measure, unless
the caravan donkeys of antiquity were much stronger than their mod
ern equivalents—the Damascus donkeys. 32 The aggan was a big mixing bowl (crater in Greek), in which
wine was mixed with water or different wines were mixed. Evidendy
the Aegean mercenaries were used to drinking together from a crater
and objected to Israelite practice. 33 Here we have another memorandum. The second paragraph was
obviously added by Nahum's scribe (it is in a different hand) in order
to keep the record straight. 34 Eliashib's house was also his office and storeroom. 35 See n. 17.
36 So read with Aharoni. 87 See n. 26.

V. Hymns and Prayers






Sumerian Hymns
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Hymn to Enlil,
the All-Beneficent
This pious, devotional document was composed by a Sumerian temple poet1 in glorification of Enlil, his city Nippur, his temple the Ekur, and his w i f e NinliL Beginning on a narrative note relating how the all-commanding, all-searching, deeply revered Enlil set up his dwelling in the Duranki2 of Nippur (lines 1-13), the hymn continues with a portrayal of the city as the guardian of man's loftiest moral and spiritual values, and therefore as a fitting home for Enlil's dwelling, the Ekur (lines 14-40), and concludes with an exulting affirmation of the mystery and holiness of the rites and rituals of that noble shrine, as conducted by a highly qualified priesthood (lines 41-64). The poet next turns to Enlil and glorifies him directly and reverently as the founder and builder of the awe-inspiring, festival-celebrating Ekur to which all "lords and princes" bring sacrifices and prayers, and all foreign lands bring their heavy tribute (lines 65-90). The poet now delivers himself of a resounding magnificat of Enlil as the glorious shepherd of all mankind w h o m not even the gods—except for his trusty vizier Nusku—dare look upon (lines 91-109), and without w h o m civilized life would be inconceivable: there would be no cities and byres, no kings and high priests, no priestly and temporal officials, no irrigation and overflow, no fish and birds, no rain and vegetation, no procreation of man and beast (lines 110-130). Once again the poet then turns to Enlil directly and concludes his panegyric with a paean of glorification to the profound mystery of his deeds and actions (lines 131-138) and particularly to his unalterable, beneficent word that brings overflow from heaven and vegetation to the earth—the very "life of all the lands" (lines 139-154)3 and to his gracious, eloquent, and fate-decreeing NinliL4 By 1961 more than a score of tablets and fragments inscribed with this hymn had become available, including five pieces in the Hilprecht Sammlung of the Friedrich-Schiller University that were copied by Dr. Inez Bernhardt under my guidance (cf. TuMNF, hi, pp. 11-12), and A d a m Falkenstein was able to publish a fine trustworthy edition of the composition in SGL, i, pp. 5-79. Nevertheless there were still a number of gaps and misreadings, and most of these have been filled in and corrected by Daniel Reisman in the course of preparing a dissertation on Sumerian divine hymns, with the help of collations of some of the originals, a recently published Ur piece (cf. UET, vi, Part 1, comment to No. 65), and a number of still unpublished pieces in the University Museum and the Istanbul Museum of the Ancient
1 The author was no doubt a graduate of the famous Nippur edubba (academy), who joined the personnel of the Ekur in one capacity or another, perhaps even as a kind of "poet in residence." The major stylistic device which he utilized for poetic effect in this composition is cumulative parallelism. 2 Duranki "Bond of Heaven (and) Earth" is an epithet applied to the Ekur temple-complex. 3 As is clear from this hymn, the "word" of Enlil could be most beneficent; it was by no means the all-destructive force generally assumed by earlier scholars (cf. JCS, 11, pp. 54-55). 4 It is not improbable that this hymn was actually composed on the occasion of an Enlil-Ninlil hieros-gamos ritual celebrated in the Ekur; Sumerian documents usually leave to the very end the purpose and occasion for which they were composed.
Orient The present translation utilizes the results of Reisman's study.
Enlil whose command is far-reaching, lofty his word (and) holy, Whose pronouncement is unchangeable, who decrees destinies unto the distant future, Whose lifted eye scans the land, Whose lifted beam searches the heart of all the landWhen Father Enlil seats himself broadly on the holy dais, on the lofty dais, When Nunamnir carries out to supreme perfection lordship and kingship, The earth-gods bow down willingly before him, The Anunna humble themselves before him, Stand by faithfully in accordance with (their) instructions. The great (and) mighty lord, supreme in heaven (and) earth, the all-knowing one who understands the judgement, (10) Has set up (his) seat in Duranki—the wise one, Made preeminent in princeship the \iur, the "great place," In Nippur the lofty bellwether of the universe he erected (his) dwelling.
The city—its "face" is awesome fear (and) dread, Its outside no mighty god can approach, Its inside is (full of) cries of mutilation, cries of blood
shed,
It is a trap that serves as a pit and net against the rebellious land, It grants not long days to the braggart, Allows no evil word to be uttered against (the divine) judgment. Hypocrisy, distortion,5 (20) Abuse, malice, unseemliness, Insolenceenmity, oppression, Envy? (brute) force, libelous speech, Arrogance, violation of agreement, breach of contract,
abuse6 of (a court) verdict,
(All these) evils the city does not tolerate.
5 A more literal translation of lines 20-21 reads: That (whose) inside (is not like its) outside, the word that is not straight, Inimical words, that which is inimical and that which is not (well) established. 0 This rendering is a guess based on the context. 7 Literally "turning of the eyes."

H y m n to Enlil as the
Ruling Deity of the Universe
This short hymn, designated by the scribe as an irshemma,x begins with a passage consisting primarily of a stereotype list of Enlil's powers, virtues, and attributes,2 that make him and his wife Ninlil the sole rulers of the universe (lines 1-17). Following the portrayal of Enlil as a god of fertility (lines 18-22), the hymn concludes with a three-line passage whose contents may turn out to be of considerable significance, but whose meaning is unfortunately obscure and enigmatic (lines 23-25). Structurally there is little that is remarkable about the composition: except for lines 1 and 2 that show the typical repetition pattern, and the antithetically parallel lines 19 and 20, the hymn consists of descriptive lines that add up to a pious, impressive, though far from ecstatic portrait of the god. T h e text was published in CT, xv, Plate 10, and was edited by H. Zimmern in AO, VII, 38; a translation was published in SAHG, pp. 76-77 (cf. comment in Bi. Or., x i , p. 173, note 21).
Lord who knows the destiny of the land, trustworthy in his [calling],3 Enlil who knows the destiny of the land, trustworthy in his calling, Father Enlil, lord of all the lands, Father Enlil, lord of the rightful command, Father Enlil, shepherd of the blackheads,4 Father Enlil, insightful in his calling, Father Enlil, the wild ox who walks to and fro among men, Father Enlil who sleeps lightly, Recumbent wild ox, unruffled bull, Lord Enlil, the "merchant"5 of the wide earth, (10) Lord, whose wife is the "trader"5 of the Earth, Lord, who makes abundant the erin-fat, the nunuz-milk, Lord, whose dwelling place guides the cities, Whose sleeping place is "great" in accordance with instructions, From the mountain of sunrise to the mountain of sunset, There is no (other) lord in the land, you alone8 are king, Enlil, in all the lands there is no queen, your wife alone8 is queen.

3 This rendering assumes that im-te-na is a variant form of me-te-na. * "Blackheads" is an epithet of the Sumerians from (at least) the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur. 5 The implications of the epithets "merchant" and "trader" (following line) as epithets of Enlil and his wife are obscure. 6 This rendering of AB-da is a guess based on the context.
Mighty one, the rain of heaven, the water of the earth is under your care, Enlil, the "shepherd-crook" of the gods is under your care. Father Enlil you who make grow the plants, who make grow the grain, (20) Father Enlil, your rays scorch the fish in the sea, You make the birds multiply in heaven, fill the sea with fish, Father Enlil you brought the noble . . . , poured the gigur7 upon the head; Lord of the land, you brought the weapon of destruction, where is the gigur7 for the reign, Father Enlil, the faithful "slaves" were changed into treacherous "slaves."
It is an irshemma-song.
Hymn to Ninurta as God
of Vegetation
T h i s is a rather rare type of lyrical hymn addressed to Ninurta as the deity in charge of fertility and vegetation.1 T h e poem begins with a four-line strophe typical of Sumerian hymnal compositions, in which the first two lines and second two lines are identical except that the epithet of the first half of the strophe is replaced by the proper name to which it belongs. Then follows at least three strophes of three lines each characterized by a simple, though not ineffective repetition pattern. T h e text was published in SLTN, No. 62; a translation was published in SAHG, pp. 59-60 (cf. the comment in Bi. Or., xi, p. 171).

7 The word gigur usually denotes a kind of basket, a meaning that does not seem to fit the context here.
1 Ninurta was conceived and worshipped in a rather contradictory twofold aspect. As the deity in charge of the South Wind, he is the god of battle who destroys the rebellious land, and in accordance with some as yet unknown Sumerian myth, avenges his father Enlil. On the other hand Ninurta is "the farmer of Enlil," and as such is of course the god of fertility, prosperity, and long life. It is this latter aspect of Ninurta that the poet of this hymn exalts in lyric song.

Hymn to Ninurta as a God
of Wrath
This composition1 exalts Ninurta as a god of wrath who roams about in the night, and is dedicated to battle, like the pest-god Irra; he is a monstrous dragon and venomous snake w h o crushes the evil and rebellious lands; he is a judge whose verdict is awesome; he brings about the destruction of the enemy and of the contentious and disobedient. Structurally, the entire poem consists of two-line strophes, with each line divided into two hemistichs; the two lines are identical except that the first begins with "My king," and the second with "Lord Ninurta."2 The text was published in BE, x x x , N o . 4 (Plates 7-8) together with a transliteration and translation; a translation only was published in SAHG, pp. 60-61 (cf. comment in Bi. Or., xi, p. 171).3

1 Only the reverse of the tablet on which the composition is inscribed is preserved in large part (top and bottom of the tablet are missing); the obverse has only the ends of lines and is therefore left untranslated. 2 This is true of the untranslated text of the obverse also, to judge from the fact that the ends of each set of two lines are identical.
3 The reasons for the differences between this translation and that in SAHG, pp. 60-61, will be readily apparent to the cuneiformist. Note, however, that en-na of line 17 (it is missing for some reason in line 18) is here rendered "the contentious," that is, it is assumed to have a meaning parallel to nu-ie, "the disobedient" (cf. also line 131 of the "Hymnal Prayer of Enheduanna").

Ishkur and the Destruction of

be divided into three parts. T h e first consists of an hymnal address to Ishkur, in which he is exalted as a noble radiant bull whose name reaches the zenith of the sky, so that even his father, the great Enlil, fears his roar (lines 1-14). The poet then introduces a speech to Ishkur by Enlil in which he commissions his son to fill up and harness the winds, and with his herald "Lightning" at the head to proceed to "the rebellious land" which he is to destroy by raining a torrent of hailstones on it (lines 15-24). In the third and very brief concluding section the poet proclaims reassuringly that the howling, roaring, Ishkur gave heed to Enlil's word, but unfortunately gives no details (lines 25-29). Stylistically the poet makes use of quite a variety of rather simple poetic devices: a combination of epithet and short half-line refrain (lines 1-9); cumulative parallelism (lines 10-14 and 26-28); repetition of lines with minor changes (lines 15-18); the half-line exclamatory refrain (lines 20-23); antithetically worded phrases (lines 22-25).
TTie text of this composition was published in CT, xv, Plates 15-16; the most recent translation was published SAHG, pp. 8183 (cf. Bi. Or., xi, p. 173, note 24).
[Noble bull,] radiant your name [reaches heaven's zenith], [Father] Ishkur, noble bull, radiant your name [reaches] heaven's [zenith], Ishkur, son of An,1 noble bull, radiant your name [reaches] heaven's zenith, Lord of Ennigi,2 noble bull, radiant your name [reaches] heaven's zenith, Ishkur, lord of overflow, noble bull, radiant your name [reaches] heaven's zenith, Twin brother of the lord Enki,3 noble bull, radiant (your name reaches heaven's zenith),4 Father Ishkur, lord who rides the storm, your name reaches heaven's zenith, Father Ishkur, who rides the great lion, your name reaches heaven's zenith, Ishkur, lion of heaven, noble bull, glorious, your name reaches heaven's zenith. Your name5 has attacked the land again and again, (10) Your radiance has covered the land like a garment, At your roar, the great mountain Enlil lowers his head (in fear), At your bellow, Ninlil trembles.
Enlil commissioned his son, Ishkur: "My young one, fill up the winds before you, harness the winds before you, Ishkur, fill the winds before you, harness the winds before you, Let the seven winds be harnessed for you like a team, harness the winds before you,
1 In this line it is An who is said to be the father of Ishkur, while
according to line 26, it is Enlil who is "his father who begot him";
this provides another example of the An-Enlil identification, cf.,
e.g., p. 580. 2 For the location of Ennigi, cf. Edzard, ZZB, p. 74, and note 360. 3 Enki's father is also An-Enlil. 4 The parentheses in this line indicate intentional omission by the
scribe of the last part of the refrain because of lack of space.
5 "Name" seems to be used here in the same sense as "word."
Let the howling wind howl for you, harness the winds before you, Let your vizier "Lightning" go before you, (harness)8 the winds (before you), My young one, go, go joyfully, who is like you when approaching it! (20) To the rebellious land, hated by the father who begot you, who is like you when approaching it! Take small stones, who is like you when approaching it ! Take large stones, who is like you when approaching it! Rain down on it your small stones, your large stones, Destroy the rebellious land to your right, subdue it to your left."
Ishkur gave heed to the words spoken by his father who begot him, Father Ishkur coming forth from the house is a howling wind, Coming forth from the house, from the city, is a young lion,
Setting forth from the city he is a roaring storm.
It is an irshemma of Ishkur.
Self-Laudatory Hymn of
Inanna and Her Omnipotence
T h e hymn begins with a triumphant pronouncement by the goddess of the vast powers and important prerogatives that Enlil, as head of the pantheon, turned over to her (lines 1-13). As the "wild c o w " of Enlil, she continues exaltingly, she is privileged to enter at will Enlil's holy temple, the Ekur of Nippur—a privilege which was presumably denied to other gods (lines 14-20). She closes her paean of self-glorification with a list of her temples in all the more important cities of Sumer and Akkad (lines 21-33). Structurally, the composition may be divided into (1) an initial five-line strophe in which the first and second lines are virtually identical with the fourth and fifth lines,1 while the middle third line is a summary exclamatory statement of her unique power, which is repeated as the very last line of the composition; (2) an eight-line strophe characterized by cumulative parallelism; (3) a seven-line passage essentially narrative in character; a twelve-line strophe that, like the second strophe, obtains its effect by cumulative parallelism.

HYMNS
(lines 1-142), is a hymnal prayer to Inanna, purportedly uttered by Enheduanna, the daughter of Sargon the Great, founder of the Dynasty of A k k a d , w h o appointed her as en, or high-priestess of Nanna (also known as Sin) the tutelary deity of Ur.1 The second, and very brief, section (lines 143-150) contains the author's pronouncement that Enheduanna's prayer had been accepted by the goddess, who was now made welcome in Ur by Nanna and his wife Ningal. The document is of significance for the religious and political history of Sumer, though unfortunately not a little of its content is ambiguous and obscure. Enheduanna begins her orison to Inanna as the deity in charge of all the me,2 the divine norms, duties, and powers, assigned to all cosmic and cultural entities at the time of creation, in order to keep them operating harmoniously and perpetually (lines 1-8). She then proceeds to depict the more cruel, destructive, and vindictive aspects of the goddess: she is a venomous, thundering, flood-and-fire raining deity whose rites are unfathomable (lines 9-16); she is an awesome storm deity before whom all mankind trembles and quakes (lines 17-28); she is an irate, relentless, and intractable goddess of war before whom even the great gods flee in terror (lines 26-42); she is the cruel conqueror of Mt. Ebih and its rebellious people (lines 43-50)8; as the goddess of love, as well as war, she deprives the unsubmissive city of all procreation and vegetation (lines 51-57).
Following a brief chant of adoration of Inanna as a great, wise, merciful and life-giving goddess (lines 58-65), comes a long passage in which Enheduanna pictures the misery and suffering that have overtaken her (lines 66-108); it is this passage that is interspersed with what seem to be several references to political events. This is followed in turn by a brief prayer of the highpriestess to Inanna as her dear and powerful queen to keep her out of her bitter straits (109-121). Enheduanna then proceeds to invoke Inanna with a resounding magnificat that recounts her immense powers, and closes with a plea to the goddess to turn a friendly heart to her adoring, devout, and pious votary (lines 122-142). T h e composition concludes with Inanna's acceptance of Enheduanna's supplication (lines 143-150), and a summary three-line invocation of the goddess by the author-poet (lines 151-153).
The first major publication of the text of the composition was by Stephen Langdon in PBS, x/4, Nos. 3 and 4. Since then some fifty tablets and fragments inscribed with the text have been identified, one of the best preserved has been published recently in UET, vi, Part 2, No. 107 (cf. ibid., p. n, note 39). Transliterations and translations of part of the text were published by Langdon, PBS, x/4, pp. 260-4, a n d by M. Witzel, Keilschriftliche Studien, vi, pp. 73-89. A definitive edition of the text including all variants, together with a study of its poetic structure and literary significance, as well as a complete glossary, has been prepared by William W. Hallo and A. J. A. van Dijk, and will appear in the near future as a monograph published by Yale University Press.

Destroyer of the foreign lands, you have given wings to the storm, Beloved of Enlil you made it (the storm) blow over the land, You carried out the instructions of An. My queen, the foreign lands cower at your cry, (20) In dread (and) fear of the South Wind,9 mankind Brought you their anguished clamor, Took before you their anguished outcry Opened before you wailing and weeping, Brought before you the "great" lamentations in the city streets.
In the van of battle, everything was struck down before you, My queen, you are all devouring in your power, You kept on attacking like an attacking storm, Kept on blowing (louder) than the howling storm, Kept on thundering (louder) than Ishkur, (30) Kept on moaning (louder) than the evil winds, Your feet grew not weary, You caused wailing to be uttered on the "lyre of lament."
My queen, the Anunna, the great gods, Fled before you like fluttering bats, Could not stand before your awesome face, Could not approach your awesome forehead. Who can soothe your angry heart!
deities of the Sumerian pantheon: An, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, NannaSin, Utu, and (perhaps) Inanna herself. 6 The Sumerian storm-god. 7 "The Inanna of heaven (and) earth" is a rather strange expression, but that is what the text seems to say. 8 This statement seems to contradict the myth mentioned in note 2, according to which it was Enki who presented the me to Inanna; there may therefore have been other versions of the tale. The "instructions of An," in line 19, on the other hand refer no doubt to the "word" of An (and) Enlil—the two gods are often identified and treated as one and the same deity in the post Ur-III literary documents—that was often destructive in character, since the leading deity of the pantheon had the unpleasant duty of carrying out the not infrequendy unfavorable decisions of the gods. 8 This usually refers to Ninurta, the god of the South Wind, but here it seems to allude to storms in general.
Your baleful heart is beyond soothing! Queen, happy of "liver," joyful of heart, (40) (But) whose anger cannot be soothed, daughter of Sin, Queen, paramount in the land, who has (ever) paid you (enough) homage!
The mountain who kept from paying homage to youvegetation became "tabu" for it, You burnt down its great gates, Its rivers ran with blood because of you, its people had nothing to drink, Its troops were led off willingly (into captivity) before you, Its forces disbanded themselves willingly before you, Its strong men paraded willingly before you, The amusement places of its cities were filled with turbulence, Its adult males were driven off as captives before you. (50)
Against the city that said not "yours is the land," That said not "It belongs to the father who begot you," You promised your holy word, turned away from it, Kept your distance from its womb, Its woman spoke not of love with her husband, In the deep night she whispered not (tenderly) with him, Revealed not to him the "holiness" of her heart.
Rampant wild cow, elder daughter of Sin, Queen, greater than An, who has (ever) paid you (enough) homage! You who in accordance with the life giving me, great queen of queens, (60) Have become greater than your10 mother who gave birth to you, (as soon as) you came forth from the holy womb, Knowing, wise, queen of all the lands, Who multiplies (all) living creatures (and) peoplesI have uttered your holy song.

(90) My wild cow (Inanna) assaults there its men, makes them captive.
I, what am I among the living creatures! May An give over (to punishment) the rebellious lands that hate your (Inanna's) Nanna, May An split its cities asunder, May Enlil curse it, May not its tear-destined child be soothed by her mother,
Oh queen who established lamentations* Your "boat of lamentations," has landed in an inimical land, There will I die, while singing the holy song.
15 Here begin several passages that may reflect political struggles between the cities of Kish (or Agade), Erech, and Ur during the reign of the Dynasty of Akkad. In lines 74-76, Enheduanna, as the high-priestess of Nanna-Sin in Ur, prays to that deity to intercede for her with An so that he might deliver her of her cruel fate. Superficially, this fits in well with the Sumerian theological view: NannaSin, as the tutelary deity of Ur would intercede with An (or An-Enlil, cf. note 8), as the leading deity of the Sumerian pantheon whose word was final, as it were. According to lines 77-91, however, An was no longer the head of the pantheon, and Inanna had taken over his sway over Erech (this may reflect a victory of Kish-Agade, where Inanna played an important role, over Erech). Nevertheless, to judge from lines 92-96, Enheduanna continues to treat An as all powerful. Finally, lines 99-108 seem to point to a disastrous event that overtook Ur; this may have been an attack by Erech, now Inanna's city, that led to her acceptance as an important deity in Ur (cf. lines 148-150). Needless to say, however, all these surmises are highly tentative, since the relevant text is cryptic, elusive, and ambiguous.
16 The meaning of the line in the context is obscure. 1TThis is the famous temple of An and Inanna in Erech. Note however that there were Eanna-shrines in other cities of Sumer, such as Lagash and Ur.
As for me, my Nanna watched not over me, (100) I have been attacked most cruelly. Ashimbabbar has not spoken my verdict. But what matter, whether he spoke it or not! I, accustomed to triumph, have been driven forth from (my) house, Was forced to flee the cote like a swallow, my life is devoured, Was made to walk among the mountain thorns, The life-giving tiara of ^n-ship was taken from me, Eunuchs were assigned to me—"These are becoming to you," it was told me.
Dearest queen, beloved of An, Let your holy heart, the noble, return to me, ( n o ) Beloved wife of Ushumgalanna (Dumuzi), Great queen of the horizon and the zenith, The Anunna have prostrated themselves before you. Although at birth you were the younger sister,18 How much greater you have become than the Anunna, the great gods! The Anunna kiss the ground before you.
It is not my verdict that has been completed, it is a strange verdict that has been turned into my verdict, The fruitful bed has been abolished,19 (So that) I have not interpreted to man the commands of Ningal. For me, the radiant en of Nanna, ( l 2 ° ) May your heart be soothed, you who are the queen beloved of An.20 "You are known, you are known"—it is not of Nanna that I have recited it,21 it is of you that I have recited it. You are known by your heaven-like height, You are known by your earth-like breadth, You are known by your destruction of rebel-lands, You are known by your massacring (their people), You are known by your devouring (their) dead like a dog, You are known by your fierce countenance. You are known by the raising of your fierce countenance, You are known by your flashing eyes. ( I 3 ° ) You are known by your contentiousness22 (and) disobedience, You are known by your many triumphs"It is not of Nanna that I have recited it, it is of you that I have recited it.
1 8 It is assumed that the sign NIN, "queen," is an error for NIN», "sister." 19 This and the following line probably allude to the sacred marriage ceremony between Nanna-Sin and the goddess Ningal, in which the latter was presumably represented by the high priestess. 20 Note the seeming contradiction between this line and lines 77 ft.
21 That is, the "you are known" magnificat. 22 This is assumed to be the meaning of en-na, cf. also BE, xxx, No. 4, rev. 17.

This rather tersely worded, enigmatic hymn to the Ekur ("Mountain House"), Enlil's renowned temple in Nippur,1 is inscribed on an excellently preserved tablet excavated some seventy years ago at Nippur, and now in the University Museum.2 It consists of four songs, each characterized by a special refrain. The first, second, and third songs are designated by the poet as sagidda, kiuruguda, and sagarra;3 the fourth is left undesignated, probably accidentally. The first, third, and fourth songs, but not the second, are followed by antiphons.
T h e poem was edited by the writer in RSO, x x x n (1957), 95-102. T h e translation does not offer too many difficulties; by and large there are but few lexical and grammatical problems. Nevertheless much of its contents remains obscure—the names of the buildings and structures that constitute the larger part of the first song are still unidentifiable in the main, and the laconically worded religious implications of the remaining songs are puzzling and elusive.4
23 This probably refers to some disaster in Erech. 24 This rendering of gu-en-na (note that this may be a variant form of utyiri) is based on the context.
1 For an ancient map of Nippur, with the Ekur and perhaps some
of the gates mentioned in the hymn, cf. HBS, pp. 232-36; cf. also
the description of the Ekur in the Ur-Nammu hymn (pages 583-84)
and in the Enlil hymn (pages 573-76). 2 The tablet, like the vast majority of Sumerian literary tablets, dates
from the first half of the second millennium B.C., but may have been
composed as early as about 2000 B.C. 3 The sa of sagidda and sagarra means "string," and points to the
accompaniment of the song by musical instruments. The rubric
\iuruguda, on the other hand, probably refers to some liturgical par
ticipation by the worshippers. 4 For some of the structures listed in lines 6 ff., cf. Falkenstein,

Topographie von Vru\, and ZA, XLVIII, p. 86 ff. In line 7 "Gate of
Peace" (so rather than "Welfare Gate") points to the existence of a
place in Nippur where the warring Sumerian city-states came to con
clude or solemnize their peace treaties. For the Gagishshua, cf. espe
cially the Ur-Nammu hymn (pages 583-84). In line 25, the Ashte is
probably a granary; cf., e.g., the Ashte mentioned in the Urukagina
"Reform" document (S. N. Kramer, The Sumerians, p. 317). The
"mountain of aromatic cedar" (lines 44 ff.) is a description used of
the cosmological "mountain where the sun rises," that is, the Sumerian
"Olympus" (cf. BASOR, 96, 20 ff.), and it is not impossible, therefore,
that the Ekur was conceived as its replica. In line 51 "Enlil" is no
doubt a scribal error for Ninlil. Ninurta and Ashimbabbar (another
name for the moon-god Nanna-Sin) are both sons of Enlil. Between
lines 68 and 69, a line containing a rubric has no doubt been acci
dentally omitted; the "its" of line 70 refers to this omitted rubric.

Ur-Nammu Hymn: Building
of the Ekur and Blessing
by Enlil
This composition, designated by the scribe as a "tigi of Enlil"1 is divided into two songs: a sagidda and a sagarra. T h e first
1 For the //gi-genre of composition, cf. SAHG, pp. 20-21, but note
that the rendering "Pauken-lied" is probably unjustified; more likely
it is a lyre-accompanied song.
begins with a poetic statement2 of the selection by Enlil of UrNammu as king of Sumer (lines 1-6), and of his commission to restore the Ekur (lines 7-14). There follows a description of the rebuilding of the Ekur, die decoration of its gates with mythological scenes, and the building of the giguna3 (lines 1530). Ur-Nammu then turned his attention to the Gagishshua, the shrine of Enlil's wife, Ninlil, and provided the divine couple with their needs, so that they live there in happy bliss (lines 31-35). All of which moves Enlil to pronounce a blessing on the faithful king (lines 36-38). The second song begins with Enlil's blessing given in direct speech by the god to the king—Ur-Nammu will reach the summit of power, temporal and religious, and his fame and name will fill the universe (lines 40-51). The poet then continues with a eulogy of Ur-Nammu as the mighty victor over his enemies with the help of Enlil's divine weapons (lines 52-57); as the destroyer of evil cities and oppressors (lines 58-61); as the one who carries on raging attacks against injustice. The poet concludes by depicting Ur-Nammu on his "dais of kingship" in his capital Ur. T h e text was published in SRT, No. 1 1 ; a translation was published by Falkenstein in SAHG, pp. 87-90 (cf. Bi. Or., x v n , pp. 173-74, note 27, and ZA, LII, 81-82), and a detailed edition of the text was published in ZA, LIII, 106-18.4
Lofty Enlil, [whose decision is unalterable] . . ., The lord of great princeship . . . , Nunamnir,8 the god who . . . , Lifted (his) eyes over the people [looked with favor upon Ur-Nammu], the shepherd; Enlil, the Great Mountain, [chose] him from among all his people, [Filled] with fearsome awe the confirmed shepherd of Nunamnir.
[To restore] the brickwork of the Ekur in accordance with the me, Enlil, the Great Mountain, who [makes glorious] his [lofty] shrine, the Ekur, like the light of day, Set his . . . heart, Commissioned Ur-Nammu, the shepherd, to lift the head of the Ekur heaven-high, (10) Exalted the king [in] the land, lifted (his) head heaven-high. For the faithful shepherd Ur-[Nammu] who with (the support of) Enlil is heroic unto distant days, He who knows decisions, the lord of [great understanding], directed the brickmold, Enlil kept under control for Ur-Nammu, the shepherd, his foes (and) enemies.
2 The first stanza, designated as sagidda, is written in "high" narra
tive prose, with relatively few epithets, and virtually no significant
repetition and parallelism of lines. The second stanza, the sagarra, on
the other hand uses characteristic Sumerian poetic devices; it begins
with two six-line verses that are identical except for a minor change
in the first line; and a similar repetition pattern is utilized in the
remainder of the stanza, except for the last six lines that revert to the
narrative "high" prose style. 3 For this structure, cf. CAD, s.v. 4 The translation here presented differs considerably from that in
ZA, LIII (the reasons for these differences will be readily apparent to
the cuneiformist). 5 This is another name for Enlil found frequendy in the literary
texts; its meaning is not quite certain.

The Sumerians, enjoying days of prosperity, Rejoiced greatly with him, Laid firm (its) foundations, filled in (its) holy terrace. The enqum- and ninqum-pnests duly exalt it.6
The house that Enki had adorned beautifully,7 Ur-Nammu, the shepherd, raised the head of the lofty Ekur in Duranki (Nippur) heaven-high, (20) (So that) the people, all of them, stood before it in awe.
(Of the) Lofty Gate, Great Gate, Gate of Peace, Highrising Mountain, (and) Gate of Uncut Grain,"8 He (Ur-Nammu) decorated their front with electrum (and) chaste silver: The Imdugud killed a lion, The Awrm-bird seized the evil man®
The doors, the lofty, he filled them with seemly beauty, The lofty house he made awe-inspiringIt was wide in extent, it was most awesome, The storied mountain, the giguna, as a dwelling place for the Great Mountain (Enlil), He established in its (the Ekur's) midst, like a lofty tower, (30)
The Gagishshua, the lofty palace where he decrees the great decisions, He beautified fittingly for Ninlil, the great queen, Enlil and Ninlil were happy there, In its dining halls, the faithful man, the chosen of Nunamnir, He multiplies all things noble, the Ekur was in joy.
They (Enlil and Ninlil) looked favorably upon UrNammu, the shepherd, The Great Mountain (Enlil) decreed a great fate for Ur-Nammu, into distant days, Exalted (his) might over his "blackheaded ones" (the Sumerians):
It is a sagidda.
"I, Nunamnir, whose life-giving commands (and) decisions are unalterable— (40) You have made my lofty Ekur resplendent, With brilliant facades you raised it heaven-high, Faithful man of valor, you made it resplendent in the Land (Sumer), Ur-Nammu—of <?«-ship(?) and kingship may you be their acme, May your name extend to the zenith of heaven, to the depths of Hades.
6 Very little is known as yet about these priests. 7 Enki is here introduced as the god of craftsmanship.

T h e King of the Road: A Self
Laudatory Shulgi Hymn
This rather unusual hymn, that is partly narrative in character, is of considerable significance not only for the nature and role of the institution of kingship in Sumer, but also for such little known aspects of its cultural life as communications and athletic prowess. It begins with a hyperbolic itemizing of Shulgi's virtues and endowments including those granted him as a favorite of }·



SUMERIAN HYMNS
the great gods, that is typical of Sumerian royal hymnography, except that, rather surprisingly they include love of the road and a passion for speed (lines 1-19).1 Moreover, following another brief, typical eulogistic passage (lines 20-26), Shulgi elaborates on his great interest in travel, claiming that he saw to it that the roads of the land were always in good repair, and that he constructed on them resthouses for the weary traveller (lines 27-35).2 He then asserts that, eager to establish his name and fame as a champion runner, he made a journey from Nippur to Ur, a distance of fifteen "double hours"—roughly about 100 miles—as if it were only a distance of one "double hour" (lines 36-45). Arriving at Ur amidst the plaudits of the multitudes, he offered immense sacrifices in the Ekishnugal, the far-famed temple of Sin, to the accompaniment of music and song (lines 46-54). After resting, bathing, and eating in his palace, he returned to Nippur in spite of a raging hailstorm, and thus could celebrate the tfici-feasts3 in both Ur and Nippur on one and the same day (lines 55-78). There in Nippur, moreover he banqueted with the sun-god Utu, and his (Shulgi's) divine spouse, the fertility goddess Inanna (lines 79-85). There, too, A n 4 invested him with the royal insignia, so that he became a mighty king whose power and glory were exalted in the four corners of the universe (lines 86-101).
Well-nigh the entire text of the hymn was available as early as 1944, cf. SLTN, p. 27, comment to Nos. 81-83, where the pertinent bibliographical references will be found, as well as a brief sketch of its contents. In 1952, Falkenstein published an edition of the hymn in Z A , L, 61-81, based on fourteen tablets and fragments, three more than were identified in SLTN.6 There were still a number of gaps and misreadings in the text, however, and these have been filled in and corrected by Jacob Klein, in the course of preparing his dissertation on Shulgi hymnography, with the help of several recently published Ur pieces,6 and a number of still unpublished duplicates in the University Museum. The present translation utilizes the results of Klein's study.

together with cumulative parallelism, are the primary poetic features
of this hymn. 2 These Shulgi resthouses are the earliest known prototypes of the
Near Eastern caravansaries and the modern motels. 8Litde is known about these feasts; cf. CAD, sub essesu. 4 Actually it is the composite deity An-Enlil that is meant here, as
can be seen from the following line where he is presented with the
scepter in Enlil's temple, the Ekur, and from line 101 where Sin, who
is well known as the son of Enlil, is said to be the son of An. 5 A translation of the hymn based on this study was published

Sumerian Wisdom T e x t
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Man and his God
A SUMERIAN VARIATION OF THE "JOB" MOTIF
This "lamentation to a man's god," as the ancient author himself describes it, is an edifying poetic essay composed, no doubt, for the purpose of prescribing the proper attitude and conduct for a victim of cruel and seemingly undeserved misfortune. The Sumerians, like all peoples throughout the ages, were troubled by the problem of human suffering, particularly relative to its rather enigmatic causes and potential remedies. Their teachers and sages believed and taught the doctrine that man's misfortunes were the result of his sins and misdeeds. They were convinced, moreover, that no man is without guilt; as our Sumerian poet-theologian puts it: "Never was a sinless child born to its mother."1 In spite of surface appearances to the contrary, therefore, there are no cases of unjust and undeserved human suffering; it is always man who is to blame, not the gods. But the truth of such theological premises and conclusions is by no means readily apparent, and in moments of adversity, more than one sufferer must have been tempted to challenge the fairness and justice of the gods, and to blaspheme against them. It may well be that it was in an effort to forestall such resentment against the gods and to ward off potential disillusionment with the divine order, that one of the sages of the Sumerian academy, the edubba,2 composed this instructive essay. The main thesis of our poet is that in cases of suffering and adversity, no matter how seemingly unjustified, the victim has but one valid and effective recourse, and that is to continually glorify his god and keep wailing and lamenting before him until he turns a favourable ear to his prayers. The god concerned is the sufferer's "personal" god, that is the deity who, in accordance with the accepted Sumerian credo, acted as the man's representative and intercessor in the assembly of the gods.3 To prove his point our author does not resort to philosophical speculation and theological argumentation. Instead, with characteristic Sumerian pragmatism, he cites a case: Here is a man, unnamed to be sure, who had been wealthy, wise and righteous, or at least seemingly so, and blest with both friends and kin. One day sickness and suffering overwhelmed him. Did he defy the divine order and blaspheme? Not at all! He came humbly before his god with tears and lamentation, and poured out his heart in prayer and supplication. As a result his god was highly pleased and moved to compassion; he gave heed to his prayer, delivered him from his misfortunes and turned his suffering to joy.
1 T h i s dogma was in line with the accepted world-view of the Sumerian theologian, according to which the gods in control of the cosmos planned and instituted evil, falsehood and violence as part and parcel of civilization; cf. S. N. Kramer, The Sumerians, pp. 125 ff. 2 For a discussion of the Sumerian edubba, its faculty, student body and curriculum, cf. S. N. Kramer, The Sumerians, pp. 229 ff. "The notion of a personal god was evolved by the Sumerian theologians in response to the feeling that the leading deities of the pantheon were too distant and aloof from the individual man, and that the latter should therefore have an intermediary, a kind of "good angel," to intercede on his behalf when the gods assembled (probably every New Year's Day) to judge all men and decide their fates; cf. especially H. and H. A. Frankfort, et al., Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, pp. 203-04. Just how these personal gods were selected by the individual or head of a family is uncertain, but we actually have the names of the "personal" deities of a number of Sumerian rulers from the second half of the third millennium B.C.
Structurally speaking, our poctic tract4 may be tentatively divided into five sections. First comes a brief introductory exhortation that man should praise and exalt his god and soothe him with lamentations (lines 1-9). The poet then introduces the unnamed individual who, upon being smitten with sickness and misfortune, addresses his god with tears and prayers (lines 10-20 plus). There follows the sufferer's petition which constitutes the major part of the poem (lines 26 minus-116). It begins with a description of the ill treatment accorded him by his fellow menfriend and foe alike (lines 26-55); continues with a lament against his bitter fate, including a rhetorical request to his kin and to the professional singers to do likewise (lines 56-95); and concludes with a confession of guilt and a direct plea for relief and deliverance (lines 96-116). Finally comes the "happy ending," in which the poet informs us that the man's prayer did not go unheeded, and that his god accepted the entreaties and delivered him from his afflictions (lines 117-129). All this leads, of course, to a further glorification of his god (lines 130-end).
T w o pieces belonging to this composition were first published in STVC, Nos. 1 and 2, but the text was there assumed to be a collection of proverbs rather than a connected essay. Later I identified three other pieces, one in the University Museum, and two in the Istanbul Museum of the Ancient Orient, and these were published in Supplement to VT, 111 (i960), pp. 172-82, together with a transliteration and translation of the text, which could now be recognized as an essay concerned with the problem of human suffering and what to do about it Still later, E. I. Gordon identified another small piece in the University Museum; this was published in Bi. Or., xvn, pp. 149 ff., where the reader will also find a number of useful bibliographical details.
Let a man utter constantly the exaltedness of his god, Let the young man8 praise artlessly the words of his god, Let the inhabitant of the straightforward land moan, In the house [of] s[ong] let him interpret . . . to his woman-friend and man-friend, Soothe [his he]art, Bring forth . . . , utter . . . ,

Akkadian Fable
DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TAMARISK AND THE DATE PALM
T e x t and translation: Lambert, BWL, pp. 151-64. An Old Babylonian version of this contest, which differs in some respects from this text and the other Ashur text translated here, is preserved. See Lambert, BWL, pp. 155 f. It begins with a phrase familiar as the opening line of Sumerian literary texts from at least 2600 B.C. on: "In long-ago days, in far-off years," followed by a mythological introduction.
I
The tamarisk [opened] his mouth [saying], "My flesh compared with [your] flesh [is . . . ] My precious, fine climbing-belt you [ . . . ] [You] are like a slave girl who be[trays] her mistress."

(7)
The [date palm] answered proudly ". . . your pods with a rod [ . . . ] When we call on a god [your] flesh [/> only good] against sin. The tamarisk does not know the best of the . . . or the best of [. . . ]."
Ditto (Tamarisk speaks). "I am better than you, a master of every craft. The far[mer . . . ] ( n ) All he has, the farmer has cut from the crooks of me, [ . . . ] He makes his spade from my trunk and with the spade made from me He opens the irrigation canal so the field gets water. I have [. . . ] And for the moisture of the soil, the grain . . .
I thresh, and grain, on which people thrive, I thresh."
Ditto (Date palm speaks). "I am better than you, a master of every craft. The farmer [. . . ] (17) All he has: reins, whips, rope1 for the team and the see[der-plow]2 Harness, . . . , rope for the . . . , net for the wagon,

Ditto (Tamarisk speaks). "Think of the equipment made from me in the king's palace. What [ . . . ] (21) [In] the king's house.

In long-ago days, in far-off years* The Fates dug the rivers; The gods of the lands, Anu, Enlil, and Ea convened an assembly.

T h e third proverb is from the time of Esarhaddon.
A common saying is: "When a potter's dog enters the kiln it will bark at the potter." A common saying is: "In a court of law the word of a sinful woman prevails over her husband's." As they say: "Man is the shadow of a god, and a slave is the shadow of a man; but "the king is the mirror of a god."
THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SHURUPPAK
Text and translation: Lambert, BWL, pp. 92-5. This text contains the advice given by Shuruppak, who survived the Flood, to his son Ziusudra (Utnapushtu in the Akkadian version). It is known in Akkadian from only a small fragment, but it is attested in Sumerian before 2500 B.C. (see R. D. Biggs, JCS, xx, p. 78, and M. Civil and R. D. Biggs, RA, LX, pp. 1-5). It is thus one of the oldest known pieces of Mesopotamian literature. The Akkadian version probably began, as does the Old Babylonian Sumerian version (see Ur Excavation Texts, vi, 169 and S. N. Kramer, Iraq, xxv, pp. 174 f.), with "On a faraway day, on a faraway night, in a faraway time." The translation is restored freely from the Sumerian versions. To judge from the Sumerian versions, the composition was originally several hundred lines in length.
Shuruppak [son of Uburtutu gave instructions], (1) To Utnapushtu [his son he gave instructions, saying], "My son, [I will give you instructions, take my instructions]; Utnapushtu, [I will give you instructions], [Do not neglect] my instructions. [Do not disobey] the words [I have spoken to you]. [One should not buy an] ass who [brays (too much)].1 [One should not locate] a cultivated field on a road [way J.1 [Do not . . . ] your field.

(beginning of text badly damaged) Do not talk [with a tale]bearer, (21) Do not consult [with a . . . ] . . . who is an idler; Because of your good qualities, you will be made into an example for them. Then you will reduce your own work, forsake your path, And will let your wise, modest opinion be perverted. Let your mouth be restrained and your speech guarded; (That) is a man's pride—let what you say1 be very precious. Let insolence and blasphemy be an abomination for you; Speak nothing profane nor any unjust report. A talebearer is looked down upon.2 (30)
Do not set out to stand around in the assembly. Do not loiter where there is a dispute, For in the dispute they will have you as an observer. Then you will be made a witness for them, and They will involve you in a lawsuit to affirm something that does not concern you. In case of a dispute, get away from it, disregard it. If a dispute involving you should flare up, calm it down. A dispute is a covered pit, A . . . wall which can cover over its foes;® It brings to mind what one has forgotten and makes an accusation against a man. (40) Do not return evil to your adversary; Requite with kindness the one who does evil to you, Maintain justice for your enemy, Be friendly to your enemy. (a number of lines damaged)
Give food to eat, beer to drink, (61) Grant what is requested, provide for and treat with honor. At this one's god takes pleasure. It is pleasing to Shamash, who will repay him with favor. Do good things, be kind all your days.
Do not honor a slave girl in your house; She should not rule [your] bedroom like a wife. . . . , do not give yourself over [to] slave girls. If she goes up your . . . , you will not go down. Let this be said [among] your people: (70)

Variant: Whatever household she enters (as wife) will be scattered and the one who marries her will not be stable. (80)
My son, if it be the wish of a ruler that you belong to him," If you are entrusted with his closely guarded seal Open his treasure house (and) enter it, For no one but you may do it.

Do not speak ill, speak (only) good. (I27) Do not say evil things, speak well of people. He who speaks ill and says evilPeople will waylay him because of his debt to Shamash. (130) Do not talk too freely, watch what you say.7 Do not express your innermost thoughts even when you are alone. What you say in haste you may regret later. Exert yourself to restrain your speech.
Worship your god every day. Sacrifice and (pious) utterance are the proper accompaniment of incense. Have a freewill offering for your god, For this is proper toward a god.

The lord [ . . . ] the confusion (41) And the warrior Enlil1 [. . . ] his . . . My god has forsaken me and disappeared, My goddess has cut me off and stayed removed from me. The benevolent spirit who was (always) beside [me] has departed,
1 Or read "warrior of Enlil," i.e. Ninurta.
My protective spirit has flown away and seeks someone else. My dignity has been taken away, my manly good looks jeopardized, My pride has been cut off, my protection has skipped off. Terrifying omens have been brought upon me, I was put out of my house and wandered about outside. (50) The omens concerning me are confused, daily there
is inflammation.
I cannot stop going to the diviner and dream interpreter. What is said in the street portends ill for me. When I lie down at night my dream is terrifying. The king, the very flesh of the gods, the sun of his peoples, His heart is enraged (with me) and cannot be appeased. Even though I stand praying they . . . against me. They gather together telling things that ought not be said. Thus the first, "I have made him want to end his life." The second says, "I made him vacate his post." (60) Likewise the third, "I shall take over his position." "I will take over his house," says the fourth. The f i f t h . . . . The sixth and seventh will pursue his . . . . The group of seven has assembled their forces, Merciless as a storm demon, they are like . . . . They are one in flesh, united in purpose. Their hearts rage against me and they are ablaze like fire. They agree on slander and lies about me. They have sought to muzzle my respectful mouth. (70) I, whose lips always prattled, have become like a mute. My hearty shout is [reduced] to silence, My proud head is bowed to the ground, Fear has weakened my brave heart. Even a youngster has turned back my broad chest. My arms, (though once) strong, are . . . . I, who used to walk like a proud man, have learned to slip by unnoticed. Though I was a respectable man, I have become a slave. To my many relations I have become like a recluse. If I walk the street, fingers2 are pointed at me; (80) If I enter the palace, eyes blink. My own town looks on me as an enemy; Even my land is savage and hostile. My friend3 has become a stranger, My companion has become an evil person and a demon. In his rage my comrade denounces me, Constantly my associate furbishes his weapons.

The one who slanders me has the god's help; The . . . who says "god have mercy" when death is imminent Without delay4 becomes well through his protective god. I have no one to go at my side, nor have I found anyone understanding. They divided all my possessions among foreign riffraff.» They stopped up the source of my canal with silt.· (100) They have stopped the joyous harvest song in my fields, And silenced my city like an enemy city. They have let another take over my duties, They appointed someone else to be present at the rites (where I should be).

I survived to the next year; the appointed time passed. (1) I turn around, but it is bad, very bad; My ill luc\ increases and I cannot find what is right. I called to my god, but he did not show his face, I prayed to my goddess, but she did not raise her head. Even the diviner with his divination could not make a prediction, And the interpreter of dreams with his libation could not elucidate my case. I sought the favor of the zaqiqu-spirit, but he would not enlighten me; The exorcist with his ritual could not appease the divine wrath against me.

What strange conditions everywhere! (10) When I look behind (me), there is persecution, trouble. Like one who has not made libations to his god, Nor invoked his goddess when he ate, Does not ma\e prostrations nor recognize (the necessity of) bowing down, In whose mouth supplication and prayer are lacking, Who has even neglected holy days, and ignored festivals, Who was negligent and did not observe the gods' rites, Did not teach his people reverence and worship, But has eaten his food without invoking his god, And abandoned his goddess by not bringing a flour offering, (20) Like one who has gone crazy and forgotten his lord, Has frivolously sworn a solemn oath by his god, (like such a one) do I appear. For myself, I gave attention to supplication and prayer: My prayer was discretion, sacrifice my rule. The day for worshipping the god was a joy to my heart; The day of the goddess's procession was profit and gain to me. The king's blessing—that was my joy, And the accompanying music became a delight for me. I had my land keep the god's rites, And brought my people to value the goddess's name. (30) I made the praise for the king like a god's, And taught the people respect for the palace. I wish I knew that these things would be pleasing to one's god! What is good for oneself may be offense to one's god, What in one's own heart seems despicable may be proper to one's god. Who can know the will of the gods in heaven ? Who can understand the plans of the underworld gods? Where have humans learned the way of a god? He who was alive yesterday is dead today. One moment he is worried, the next he is boisterous. (40) One moment he is singing a joyful song, A moment later he wails like a professional mourner. Their condition changes (as quickly as) opening and shutting (the eyes). When starving they become like corpses, When full they oppose their god. In good times they speak of scaling heaven, When they are troubled they talk of going down to hell. I am perplexed at these things; I have not been able to understand their significance. As for me, exhausted, a windstorm is driving me on! Debilitating Disease is let loose upon me: (50) An Evil Wind has blown [from the] horizon,

Headache has sprung up from the surface of the underworld, An Evil Cough has left its Apsu, The Irresistible Demon has" left E\ur, [The Lamashtu-demon came] down from the Mountain, Cramp set out [with . . . ] the flood, Weakness breaks through the ground along with the plants. [They all joined in] and came on me together. [They struc\;] my head, they enveloped my skull; [My] face is gloomy, my eyes flow. (60) They have wrenched my neck muscles and made (my) neck limp. They struck [my chest,] beat my breast. They affected my flesh and made me shake, [In] my epigastrium they kindled a fire. They churned up my bowels, . . . [they] . . . my . . . Causing the discharge of phlegm, they tired out my [lungs]. They tired out my limbs and made my fat quake. My upright stance they knocked down like a wall, My robust figure they laid down like a rush, I am thrown down like a .. . and cast on my face. (70) The alu-demon has clothed himself in my body as with a garment; Sleep covers me like a net. My eyes stare straight ahead, but cannot see, My ears are open, but cannot hear. Feebleness has overcome my whole body, An attack of illness has fallen upon my flesh. Stiffness has taken over my arms, Weakness has come upon my knees, My feet forget their motion. [A stroke] has got me; I choke like someone prostrate. (80) Death has [approached] and has covered my face. If someone is concerned about me, I am not even able to answer the one who inquires. [My . . . ] weep, but I cannot control myself. A snare is laid on my mouth, And a bolt keeps my lips barred. My "gate" is barred, my "drinking place" blocked, My hunger is . . . , my windpipe constricted. I eat grain as though it were a vile thing, Beer, the sustenance7* of mankind, is distasteful to me.
My malady is indeed protracted. (90) Through not eating, my looks have become strange, My flesh is flaccid, and my blood has ebbed away. My bones look separated, and are covered (only) with my skin. My flesh is inflamed, and the . . . -disease has afflicted me.
I have taken to a bed of bondage; going out is a pain; My house has become my prison. My arms are powerless—my own flesh is a manacle, My feet are fallen flat—my own person is a fetter. My afflictions are grievous, my wound is severe. A whip full of needles has struck me,8 (I0°) The goad that pricked me was covered® with barbs. All day long the tormentor torments [me], And at night he does not let me breathe easily for a minute. Through twisting my joints are parted, My limbs are splayed and knocked apart. I spent the night in my dung like an ox, And wallowed in my excrement like a sheep. My symptoms are beyond the exorcist, And my omens have confused the diviner. The exorcist could not diagnose the nature of my sickness, ( I I 0 ) Nor could the diviner set a time limit on my illness. My god has not come to the rescue nor taken me by the hand; My goddess has not shown pity on me nor gone by my side. My grave was waiting, and my funerary paraphernalia ready, Before I was even dead lamentation for me was finished. All my country said, "How he is crushed!" The face of him who gloats lit up when he heard, The news reached her who gloats, and her heart rejoiced. I know the day for my whole family, When, among my friends, their Sun-god will have mercy.

Text and translation: Lambert, BWL, pp. 63-91. Modern understanding of this poem is due in large measure to the penetrating study of B. Landsberger, ZA, XLIII, pp. 32-76. The Theodicy is an acrostic poem of twenty-seven stanzas of eleven lines each, not all of which are preserved, and takes the form of a dialogue. The acrostic reads: a-na-\u sa-ag-gi-tl-\i-[/na-am-u] b-bi-ib ma-ds-ma-su \a-ri-bu la i4i & sar-ri, "I Saggilkinam-ubbib, the exorcist, am an adorant of the god and the king."

The rich and opulent treat me, as a youngest brother, with contempt.
Friend XXIV O wise one, O savant, who masters knowledge, Your heart has become hardened and you accuse the god wrongly. The mind of the god, like the center of the heavens, is remote; Knowledge of it is very difficult; people cannot know it. Among all the creatures whom Aruru formed Why should the oldest offspring be so . . . ? In the case of a cow, the first calf is a runt, (260) The later offspring is twice as big. A first child is born a weakling, But the second is called a mighty warrior. Though it is possible to find out what the will of the god is, people do not know how to do it.
Sufferer XXV Pay attention, my friend, understand my clever ideas, Heed my carefully chosen words. People extol the word of a strong man who has learned to kill But bring down the powerless who has done no wrong. They confirm (the position of) the wicked for whom what should be an abomination is considered right3 Yet drive off the honest man who heeds the will of his god. (27°) They fill the [storehouse] of the oppressor with gold, But empty the larder of the beggar of its provisions. They support the powerful, whose . . . is guilt, But destroy the weak and trample the powerless. And as for me, an insignificant person, a prominent person persecutes me.
Friend XXVI Narru, king of the gods, who created mankind, And majestic Zulummar, who pinched off the clay for them, And goddess Mami, the queen who fashioned them, Gave twisted speech to the human race. With lies, and not truth, they endowed them forever. (280) Solemnly they speak favorably of a rich man, "He is a king," they say, "riches should be his," But they treat a poor man like a thief, They have only bad to say of him and plot his murder, Making him suffer every evil like a criminal, because he has no . . . Terrifyingly they bring him to his end, and extinguish him like glowing coals.

Sufferer XXVII You are kind, my friend; behold my trouble, Help me; look on my distress; know it. I, though humble, wise, and a suppliant, Have not seen help or aid even for a moment. (290) I have gone about the square of my city unobtrusively, My voice was not raised, my speech was kept low. I did not raise my head, but looked at the ground, I did not worship even as a slave in the company of my associates. May the god who has abandoned me give help, May the goddess who has [forsaken me] show mercy, The shepherd, the sun of the people, pastures (his flock) as a god should.

AN OLD BABYLONIAN ORACLE FROM URUK
Text: UVB, V o l x v m (1962), plate 28. This text, found in the palace of Sin-kashid of Uruk (about 1850 B.C.), apparently refers to the revival of Uruk under the Sin-kashid dynasty, and it may be he who is addressed (albeit in the third person) at the beginning and the end of the text. The "I" of the text, who is not identified, does not disclose the means of the goddess's appearance to him, but quite possibly it was in a dream. The text, which has many grammatical inconsistencies, is so poorly preserved at the end that most of the goddess's final speech, obviously the most important, is unintelligible.
The faithful shepherd, whose name is good, whose guardian angel is permanent, entered the temple Eannafrom now on well-being will be before him, vigor behind him. (6) From a day Nanaya2 visited me and had me sit down in the doorway of the god Sin, her father: She spoke, saying: (10) "Until I have established a faithful shepherd and3 revived dead Uruk you shall grind the ^«/«-ration of Uruk. Great Uruk will be given to me. Town and temple I will take over (15) when the faithful shepherd has been designated for the land." I spoke saying: "Dead Uruk has revived and the faithful shepherd concerning whom a command came from you (20) has been established . . . ." She spoke saying: "When I reestablish Uruk . . . , and as for the faithful shepherd . . . , . . . , to me . . . , (25) Sit down, do not move . . . , . . . , keep the . . . ." The words which Ishtar said to me—Let my lord pay attention to what I say. Let him retain my words (30) so he may attain the wishes of the god.

(7) In a dream the god Ashur spoke to the grandfather of the king my lord (i.e. Sennacherib), the sage, [saying], "O king, lord of kings, offspring of the sage and of Adapa. . . . You surpass in knowledge even the Apsti1 and all the wise men." (10) When the father of the king my lord (i.e. Esarhaddon) went to Egypt, he saw in the region of Harran the temple made of cedar. The god Sin,2 leaning on a staff, had two crowns on his head. The god Nusku was standing in front of him. The father of the king my lord entered and he (i.e. Nusku) placed [a crown] on his head, saying, "You will go and will make conquests in several countries." (15) He left and in fact conquered Egypt. Other lands, not yet submissive to Ashur and Sin, the king, lord of kings, will conquer, (rest too damaged for translation)

(v 46) The goddess Ishtar heard my anxious sighs and said "Fear not!" and gave me confidence, (saying) "Since you have lifted your hands in prayer and your eyes have filled with tears, I have had mercy." During the night in which I appeared before her, (50) a iabrti-priest lay down and had a dream. He awoke with a start and then Ishtar caused him to see a nocturnal vision. He reported to me as follows: "The goddess Ishtar who dwells in Arbela came in. Right and left quivers were suspended from her. She was holding a bow in her hand, (55) and a sharp sword was drawn to do battle. You were standing in front of her and she spoke to you like a real mother. Ishtar called to you, she who is most exalted among the gods, giving you the following instructions: 'Wait with the attack;1 (for) wherever you intend to go, I am also ready to go.' You said to her, 'Wherever you go, I will go with you, O goddess of goddesses!'

V I I . Lamentations






Sumerian Lamentation
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
Lamentation over the
Destruction of Sumer and Ur
This outstanding composition, that is of no little significance for the history of Sumer as well as for its religion and culture, consists of over 500 lines, of which about 400 are fairly well preserved. It is divided into five \irugu, or stanzas, of unequal length. The first of these, which consists of 115 lines, begins with a detailed account of the tragic fate decreed by the four leading deities of the Sumerian pantheon—An, Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursag—for Sumer and its people: the subversion of the rules of conduct that made law and order possible; the overturning of the me, that is, the rights and prerogatives bestowed upon Sumer by the gods when organizing the universe—and especially those me that were concerned with the institution of kingship; the destruction of cities and houses, of stalls and sheepfolds; the drying up of rivers and canals and the sterility of the fields and steppes; the disruption of family life; the removal of kingship to a foreign land; the suppression of oracles, the ill-treatment by Nanna himself of his temple and people, leading to the expulsion of the inhabitants of Ur and the introduction of foreign offerings into its shrines by the Su-people1 and the Elamites who took their place; the seizure of the terrified Ibbi-Sin and his forcible abduction to Elam whence he never returned to his homeland; the cessation of all travel and commercial intercourse between the ruined cities; the massacre of the inhabitants; the discontinuance of all sowing and plowing in field and steppe, as well as all activities concerned with animal husbandry; the wasting away of all growth from marsh and swamp, from orchard and garden; the utter prostration of Ur, the city famed for its lordship and kingship (lines 1-57).
The poet next turns to the bitter events that followed in the wake of the cruel decision taken by the gods against Sumer: seven of Sumer's leading deities turned against the land and brought harm to it, each in his own fashion (lines 58-64); the land was overtaken by a calamity the like of which was unknown to man, one that brought terror and chaos in its wake, namely, the deluge-like invasion of the Gutians who laid waste to everything in their path (lines 65-80), bringing with them bloody days of wreckage when even heaven and earth were convulsed and utter darkness held sway and the dead of Sumer lay heaped up on land and filled the Euphrates (lines 81-97); those who succeeded in escaping with their lives abandoned wife and child, home and property (98-102); Sumer was in a state of utter anarchy, its king lived in fear and anguish in his palace, and all about there was nothing but death and destruction (lines 103-115). In the second \irugu, the poet takes up the destruction of Sumer city by city from north to south, thus:2 Kish and Hursagkalamma that were abused by the enemy (lines 119-122); Kazallu that suffered drought and famine (lines 126-135); Marda abandoned by its tutelary deity Lugalmarda (lines 136-138); Isin deprived of its quays because of the dearth of water (lines 139141); Nippur and its shrine Duranki, smitten by its own great

Edzard, ZZB (index to place names and god-names); Sjoberg's forthcoming study on the Temple Hymns (now in press as a volume in the series Texts from Cuneiform Sources, J. J. Augustin, publisher), and Jacobsen, Iraq, xxi, pp. 174-85.
god Enlil (lines 142-145); Kesh and Adab which the Gutians took over as their own (lines 146-151); Zabalam and its destroyed giguna, and Erech from whose Eanna-temple Inanna herself was carried off into captivity (lines 152-157); Umma and its shrines Sigkurshag and Ninmah forsaken by its tutelary deities (lines 158-161); the Lagash complex (Girsu, Ninmar, Kinirsha, Nina) burned and looted by the Elamites (lines 162-187); the settlements of the Edanna of Nanna whose fleeing inhabitants were destroyed by wild beasts (lines 188-190); Gaesh, a sacred suburb of Ur, whose statues, dais and throne were broken to bits (lines 191-198); Ashshu, whose "assembly house was emptied" (lines 199-202); Abrig, destroyed like a stall (lines 203-208); the egidda (of the city Ennigi) smitten by its tutelary deity Ninazu (lines 209-212); Gishbanda abandoned by Ningishzida and Azimua, its two city-gods (lines 213-216); H.A abandoned by Asarluhi and Lugalbanda (lines 217-223); Eridu abandoned by Enki and crushed by the Gutians (lines 224-253);* Ur, the capital, destroyed by the Elamites and the Tidnumites4 (lines 254-265);" Kisiga, the city destroyed by the Elamites, whence the fettered Dumuzi departed to the nether world accompanied by the wailing "queen" (lines 266-282).
Following a break of 11 lines, part of which began the third \irugu, we find the poet turning from Sumer as a whole to Ur, its capital. He bewails the suffering of its people, king, and priests through famine: there was no grain, beer, or cattle for food and sacrifices (lines 297-318); the canals were dry, the quays were desolate, and no offerings could be sent to Nippur for the ritual feasts and celebrations (lines 319-329); the stalls of Nanna were despoiled, and its sacred cows were carried off by the barbarous enemy so that there was not fat and milk for the temple (lines 330-339). All this, according to our poet, was too much for Ur's city-god, Nanna-Sin, who now turns to his father Enlil and pleads with him to look with favor on Ur, multiply its people once again, and restore its rights and prerogatives (lines 340-356).
But Enlil's answer, which begins the fourth \irugu, was cold and stern: Sin, he says, should pay no heed to Ur and its lamentful dirges (lines 360-365); its destruction had been decreed in the assembly of the gods and this decision cannot be alteredUr had its day of "kingship" and now this must go to some other place, since there is no everlasting "reign of kingship" (lines 366-372). Ordered to leave his city, the dejected and anguished Nanna-Sin departed from Ur followed by his hastily dressed wife Ningal and the Anunna (lines 373-379). Whereupon the city was given over to carnage and massacre at the hands of the heavily armed enemy (lines 392-396), while famine took its toll of those who did not succumb to the foe (lines 392396). This was more than the people could bear—they threw down their weapons and after taking counsel among themselves, decided to open the gates to the enemy (lines 397-407).6 In rushed the Elamites and crushed the city and its people (lines 408-411); they took over the Ekishnugal, destroyed its statues, shrines, and thrones, and slaughtered its sacred cattle (lines 412419); they split asunder its hallowed palm trees together with their fronds and dates, despoiled the sacred Magan-reeds,7 and
3 Much of this long passage is unfortunately obscure. 4 The Tidnum people are Amorites, cf., e.g., J. R. Kuppcr, Let Nomades en Mesopotamie, pp. 156-57.
6 This passage too, is enigmatic in large part. 4 We have here a rare example of a record of rebellion and treason in Sumer. 7 Magan is often identified with Egypt.

SUMERIAN LAMENTATION
carried off the wealth accumulated in the storehouses (lines 42a426); they breached its parapets, hurled down its statues of cattle and ushumgal-dr&goris (lines 427-431); made the temple desolate and unfit for holy rituals by breaking down its doors, hinges, bolts and locks (lines 432-445); dismantled the lofty dubla where the judges held court, violated Nanna-Sin's holy vessels, bed, and statues, and carried off into captivity its lustration-priests (lines 432-456). Overwhelmed by this terrible destruction of his city and temple, the suffering Nanna-Sin once again comes before his father Enlil with the plea that he turn his inimical look into a friendly one (lines 457-465). This time Enlil's response is favorable and he pronounces a blessing for the restoration of Ur and the Ekishnugal (lines 466-475). Whereupon the people gather once again in Ur from all over the land (lines 476-479), and Nanna-Sin proudly reenters his city and temple together with his wife Ningal (lines 480-484). T h e fifth \irugu begins with a plea by the poet addressed to the bitter, destructive storm to leave Ur and attack Sumer's enemies instead: Tidnum, Gutium, and Anshan8 (lines 490-500). Following a break of an unknown number of lines, the composition concludes with a fragmentary and obscure seven-line passage that seems to continue with the blessing of Ur and its people. All in all there are now more than thirty tablets and fragments inscribed with portions of this lamentation. Not a few of these had been published between the years 1914 and 1944, but because of the numerous gaps, it had been mistakenly assumed that the pieces belonged to two different compositions, a so-called "IbbiSin" lamentation, and a "Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Akkad." It is only with the publication of eleven new tablets and fragments in UET, vi, Part 2, that the text of the composition as a whole could be reconstructed, and then it became clear that it was actually a single composition beginning with a lament over the destruction of Sumer as a whole and continuing with a lament over the destruction of Ur and its temple, the Ekishnugal, and ending on a note of deliverance and salvation.9 A detailed edition of the text is planned by Gadd and Kramer for a forthcoming issue of Iraq; the present translation is based on this study.
That the day be overturned, that "law and order" cease to exist— (1) The storm is all devouring like the FloodThat the me of Sumer be overturned, That a favorable reign be withheld, That cities be destroyed, that houses be destroyed, That stalls be destroyed, that sheepfolds be wiped out, That its (Sumer's) oxen no longer stand in their stalls, That its sheep no longer spread out in their sheepfold, That its rivers flow with bitter water, That its cultivated fields grow weeds, (10) That its steppes grow wailing plants, That the mother care not for her children, That the father says not "Oh my wife," That the young wife rejoice not in (his) lap, That the young child grow not sturdy on (their) knee, That the nursemaid chant not a lullaby, That the home of kingship be changed, That the seeking of oracles be suppressed,

(All this was) after An had frowned upon all the lands,10 (22) After Enlil had set his (friendly) face to inimical soil, After Nintu had prostrated her (own) creatures, After Enki had overturned (the course of) the Tigris (and) Euphrates, After Utu had cursed the roads (and) highways
That the me of Sumer cease to exist, that its rules (of conduct) be changed, That the me of kingship (and) reign of Ur be overwhelmed, That the princely son stretch a defiling hand on his Ekishnugal, That Nanna show no respect for his people as numerous as ewes, (30) That of Ur, its shrine of the great offerings, the offerings be changed, That its people no longer inhabit its dwellings, that it be made inimical soil, That the Su-people (and) the Elamites, the enemies, inhabit their dwellings, That its shepherd (living) in terror in the palace be seized by the foe, That Ibbi-Sin be brought to the land Elam in a trapFrom Mt. Zabu11 on the "breast" of the sea, to the boundary of AnshanThat like a sparrow which has fled its "house," he return not to his city, That the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates in their entirety, grow sickly plants, That no one tread the highways, that no one seek out the roads, That its well-founded cities (and) hamlets be counted as ruins, (40) That its teeming blackheaded people be put to (slaughter by) the mace, That the cultivated fields be not hoed, that no seeds be implanted in the soil, That its shout (and) song resound not in the . . .

10 Lines 22-26 seem to be parenthetically inserted in this passage which is a good example of the cumulative parallelism utilized throughout this composition. 11 The location of Mt. Zabu is not too clear from the text, but it is somewhere to the east of Elam.

It is in the latter capacity that he seems to have sent this letter to the king Zimri-Lim, who must therefore have been absent from Mari. Hence our tablet, unless it was never sent, must be a copy.
Speak to my lord: Thus Itur-Asdu your servant. (5) The day I dispatched this tablet of mine to my lord, Malik-Dagan, a man from Shakka, ca(m)e and spoke to me as follows: "In a dream of mine I was set on going in the company of a(nother) man (10) from the fortress of Sagaratum, in the Upper District, to Mari. On my way11 entered Terqa, and right after entering I entered the temple of Dagan and (15) prostrated myself. As I was prostrate, Dagan opened his mouth and spoke to me as follows: 'Did the kings2 of the Yaminites3 and their

Our translation follows Malamat; the viewpoint of the preceding lines is not that of a spectator, but the subjective one of consciousness and intention. The meaning "on the way" for ina pant is otherwise unattested, and may therefore be a West Semitism. The route from Sagaratum to Mari would pass through Terqa, which was located on the Euphrates above Mari. 2 The Yaminite "kings," who were sheiks, are mentioned elsewhere in a number of Mari letters. The term seems to imply a military role within the tribal confederation during a time of crisis; see J. R. Küpper, Les nomades en Mesopotamie au temps des rots de Mari (Paris, 1 9 5 7 ) , 59·

forces make peace with the forces of Zimri-Lim (20) who moved up here?' I said, 'They did not make peace.' Just before I went out he spoke to me as follows: 'Why are the messengers (25) of Zimri-Lim not in constant attendance upon me, and why does he not lay his full report before me?4 Had this been done, I would long ago have delivered (30) the kings2 of the Yaminites* into the power of Zimri-Lim.8 Now go, I send you. Thus shall you speak to Zimri-Lim, saying: (35) "Se[nd] me your messengers and lay your full report before me, and then I will have the kings2 of the Yaminites8 [co6\\edm on a fisherman's spit? and I will lay them before you."'" (40) This is what this man saw in his dream and then recounted to me. I now hereby write to my lord; my lord should deal with this dream. (45) Furthermore, if my lord so desires, my lord shall lay his full report before Dagan and the messengers of my lord shall be constandy on their way to Dagan. (50) The man who told me this dream was to offer a pagrum-szcT&cz* to Dagan, and so I did not send him on. Moreover, since this man was trustworthy,® I did not take any of his hair or the fringe of his ga(r)ment.10

Now, since I (15) restored him to the throne of his father's house, I should receive from him an hereditary property.28 If he does not give (it), I am the lord of throne, territory, and city, and what I gave I will take away. If on the other hand (20) he grants my request, I will give him throne upon throne, house upon house, territory upon territory, city upon city; even the land from east to west will I give him." This is what the apilus29 said.

25 in a teretim, understood as the occasion on which the apilu's (n. 29) stepped forth (n. 30) and delivered the oracle. Malamat interprets teretim as "visions." 28 Location unknown, but probably very near Aleppo, if not a quarter of the city itself (Klengel, JCS, xix [1965], 89). Zimri-Lim was a refugee in Aleppo after the downfall of the Yahdun-Lim dynasty in Mari (n. 15). 27 pahalliya, more properly "my testicles," a realistic detail which is more easily understood if the god is here conceived in the form of a bull or calf (so Malamat; cf. also CAD, B, 250 a). 28 Following Landsberger apud Malamat, Eretz-lsrael, ν (1958), 68, and JAOS, L X X X I I (1962), 149, and taking nihlatum here and in line 27 (delete the determinative as a scribal error) as a common noun related to Heb. nah'la. For landed property as Yahweh's hereditary possession see Exod. 15:17; Jer. 2:7, etc. 29 apilum (fern, apiltum), apparently a participle meaning "the respondent," but the variant form aplum (letter i) and the existence elsewhere of cultic functionaries called aplu and apillu, all of which forms arc hardly unrelated, introduce considerable complications; apilum perhaps represents a popular etymology. 30 it-ta-na-az-za-az-{zu), lit., "they are constandy stepping forth." Malamat appeals to another meaning of the verb, "to assume responsibility for," and sees here the apilu's guaranteeing the truth of the oracle. 31 Akk. mas\anum, for which Malamat proposes a West Semitic

Now I am living [in] a different country, (but) am I not to write to my lord what I hear and they tell me?

AKKADIAN LETTERS
[To the king] my [lord] your servant [Mar-Ishtar]. [Greetings] to the king my lord. [May Nabu and Bel] bless [the king] my lord. [A long life], health and happiness may [the great gods] (5) grant the king my lord. [Damqi], the son of the bishop of Ak[kad],36 [. . .] of the land of Ashur and Babylon [. . .] exercised hegemony over the universe. He [and his queen] have . . . [ . . . ] ; (10) the substitution37 for the king my lord, [the queen-mother] (and) the . . . of Shamash-shum-ukin [he . . .]. For their redemption he went to (his) fate. We built the mausoleum, he (and) his queen (15) were outfitted in their finery, solemnly laid in state, buried, (and) mourned. The burning (of magical figurines) has been performed; all (evil) portents have been rendered ineffective; many rituals against (evil) portents, (the ceremonies) "House of {ritual) bathing," "House of dipping in water," (as well as other) incantationrituals (and) lamentations for the pacification of the gods, (20) have been carried out punctiliously, in the traditional formulae of the scribal guild. For the information of the king my lord.
I have heard that (even) before these ceremonies (of enthronement), the prophetess38 prophesied, (and) to Damqi, the bishop's son, she said: (25) "You shall bear my kingship." (reverse) Moreover, the prophetess said to him in an assembly of the people: "I have indicated the . . .3B of my lord, I have turned you over (to the assembly)."
The apotropaic (5) rituals which were performed went perfectly. The king my lord should be exceedingly gratified. (Of course) the Akkadians were frightened, (but) we reassured them (and) they calmed down. I heard (too) that the bishops and the high (temple-) officials of Akkad were frightened. (10) (Thus) have Bel and Nabu (and) all the great gods prolonged the life of the king my lord. However, during the eternity of the eclipse and the conjunction of the gods he (the king) must not in fact go to the (palace?) limits.
If it is acceptable to the king my lord, (15) a commoner should be appointed to the bishopric as previously. He should offer the daily sacrifices before the high-altar; on the days of the monthly-feasts and (the feast) of the "Greeting of the temple" he should pour out the incense on the censor-stands [before] the Lady of Akkad, (and then) should (the moon) bring about an eclipse (and with it) affe[ct] Akkad, (20) [. . .] he should serve as the king's substitute. (21-25 fragmentary) Whoever is acceptable to the king my lord, the king my lord should appoint in his (Damqi's) place.

(5) The [substitute] king, who on the evening of the fourteenth took his se[at] (upon the throne), then spent the night of the fifteenth in the palace [of Ashur], (and) whom (the moon) affected with the eclipse, entered (10) Akkad36 safe and sound on the evening of the twentieth, (and) took his seat (on the throrie). In the light of day I had (him) recite the traditional formulae of the scribal guild; he took upon himself all the signs of heaven and earth, (and) assumed the hegemony over all the universe. For the informa[tion] of the king my lord. (15) This eclipse, which (the moon) brought about in (the month of) Tebet,40 concerned the land of Amurru. The king of the land of Amurru will die, his land will diminish, (or) in another interpretation, will disappear. Surely the scholars can tell the king my lord (20) something about the land of Amurru: the land of Amurru means the land of the Hittites41 and the land of the Sutaeans,42 (or) in another interpretation, the land of Chaldaea. Someone or other of the kings of the land of the Hittites, or of the land of Chaldaea, (reverse) or of the land of the Arabs, must bear (the consequences of) this sign. For the king my lord (there is to be) contentment: the king my lord will achieve his desire. The rites and prayers (5) of the king my lord are acceptable to the gods. Either the king of Cush, or the king of [Tyre], or Mugallu43 must meet the appointed death; (10) or, the king my lord will cap[ture him], the king my lord will diminish his land, the women of his harem will enter the service of the king [my lor]d. The king my lord should be gratified.
However, the king my lord should be careful,44 and (his) vigilance great. The apotropaic rituals, the lamentations for the pacification (of the gods), the spell against malaria (and other forms of) (15) pestilence should be carried out for the k[ing my lor]d and the sons of the king, my lords.

Petschow, ZA, L V I I (1965), 150: dependent on crown, but free in the city, and therefore seldom distinguished from awtlum, the free-man. 52 Cf. Exod. 23:10 f.; Deut. 15:1 ff.; Lev. 25:1 ff. 83 ana bitim lasüm, lit., "to call at the house," is a legal expression with the broad meaning of demanding something (or a service or a person) from a family; see R. Yaron, Orientalia NS, 34 (1965), 24-27. 54 Cf. above, "Divine Revelations," letter a, lines 25 ff. 85 The nature of the sign is not clear; B. Landsberger, WO, 111/3-4 (1966), 73, n. 97, who notes here a certain similarity to the biblical conception of sign, has suggested dreams. 86 Contrary to general usage, the filial relationship does not mean that Yatar-Ami was a vassal of Zimri-Lim, but is amply an expression of respect.

Speak to Kuwari: Thus Shamshi-Adad. Surely you have heard about the hostility of Yashub-Addu (5) the Ahzaean.82 Prior to this he had followed83 the man of the Shimurraeans, deserted the man of the Shimurraeans and followed the man of the Tirukkaeans. He deserted the man of the Tirukkaeans and (10) followed the Ya'ilanum (tribe). He deserted the Ya'ilanum (tribe) and followed me. Even me he deserted and has been following the man of Kakmu. Moreover, to all (15) these kings he has sworn an oath. It is scarcely three years since he became an ally and an enemy of these kings. When he became an ally, (20) he swore an oath to me in the temple of Adad of Arrapha.

Yatar-Ami probably desired a representative of Zimri-Lim present in order to make clear his intendon of dissociating himself from any machinations of Bunuma-Addu, whose disloyalty to ZimriLim is evident from other letters. 80 Execution by burning is attested in §§110 and 157 of the Code of Hammurabi; see also ARM, in, No. 73:14-15, and cf. Gen. 38:24; Lev. 20:14; 21:9; Josh. 7:15 (Jer. 29:22). 81 Cf. Code of Hammurabi, §2. 82 This and the other gentilics are attested in other Mari letters and/or other Akkadian documents. They place Yashub-Addu's alliances in the general area of Shemshara, and hence his disloyalty should be of interest to Kuwari. 63 lit., "he went after" (war hi . . . tilth), a common expression for a relationship of dependence; cf. häla\ 'ahare, especially in the deuteronomic literature for the service of other gods (Deut. 6:14, etc.). 64 The exchange of oaths, with the suzerain also swearing, is noteworthy; cf. Deut. 26:17-19. The content of Shamshi-Adad's oath may be deduced from lines 25 ff.

T h e correspondents are the king of Qatna in Syria and Ishme-Dagan, the older brother of Yasma'-Addu of Mari and the successor of Shamshi-Adad on the Assyrian throne. The presence of this letter in the Mari archives is perhaps to be explained by the intervention of Yasma'-Addu, who, aware of the letter's tone and anxious to avoid any form of retaliation by his brother, stopped it on its way through Mari. Possibly, however, Ishme-Dagan sent it back to Mari for the consideration of his brother, who was the son-in-law of the king of Qatna.
Speak to Ishme-Dagan: Thus Ishhi-Addu your brother. (5) Right now, just to relieve my feelings, I must speak about this matter which should not be spoken about. You are a great king; you made a request to me for two horses, and I had them conducted to you. But you sent

A Loan between Gentlemen
Text: J. Nougayrol, Le palais royal d'Ugarit, 111, Mission de Ras Shamra, T o m e vi (Paris, 1955), Plate xn, RS 15.11. Translation: ibid., 19.
Speak to Muarihu the commissioner: Greetings to you. As to your writing here and saying: "He has acquired your servants from the hands of Hehea the Egyptian for 400 shekels of silver, but there are 140 shekels of my own money (10) which are outstanding. Moreover, he has now entered the temple and indeed said under oath (that) in fact he had not handed over your servants. I (still) have (15) their ransom money."I shall give (you) the money you personally disemburse, and he has returned my servants to me, so give (20) your 80 shekels72 and do not put interest (on a loan) between us. We are each of us gentlemen.73
69 Without waiting to work out terms, and presuming Ishme-Dagan's sense of fairness and propriety, Ishhi-Addu complied with the request immediately, (la for ul in la haShata is an example of the confusion of the two negatives not infrequent in the Mari letters.) 70 aslum ilim la abiya cannot mean "because of the god of my father," since this results in Ishhi-Addu's saying his feelings would have been hurt (but w e r e n o t ) , a flat contradiction of lines 29-32. Rather, it is an oath formula introducing the contrary-to-fact (negative) object-clause, lumman libbi imraf.—Cf. " t h e g o d of the fathers" and the oath in Gen. 31:53. 7 1 F o l l o w i n g W . von Soden, Orientalia N S , x x n ( 1 9 5 3 ) , 207, and reading i-fa-pa-la-ni-ti-i.
72 The background of the letter and the text itself are somewhat obscure. T h e above translation, which differs in several important details from that of Nougayrol, yields the following: the writer had previously sent some money to the addressee, w h o was to arrange the redemption of some servants. This the latter did, writing that the sum agreed on was 400 shekels; however, on finding out that the servants had not actually been handed over, no money changed hands. Subsequendy, however, the servants were turned over, and so the writer asks that the money be paid. The addressee seems to say that he would have to pay 140 shekels of his own money, but the writer mentions only 80 shekels. Nougayrol corrects the text, but the difference of 60 shekels may be the very high interest the writer wishes to avoid. This last suggestion is due to Mr. Marvin Chancy. 73 In a paper read before the American Oriental Society, 1956, A. Leo Oppenheim noted the implication that in northern Syria at this time loans between free-men customarily did not bear interest, and compared the biblical law against interest on loans to fellow-Israelites (Exod. 22:24; Lev. 25:35 ff.; Deut. 23:19 f.).

The script is very clumsy, the language shows a boy's mistakes and (probably) colloquial speech, and the complaint belongs to the "letter home" through the ages.
Speak to Zinu: Thus Iddin-Sin. May Shamash, Marduk and Ilabrat for my sake forever (5) keep you well. Gentlemen's clothes improve year by year. (10) You are the one making my clothes cheaper year by year. By cheapening and scrimping my clothes74 (15) you have become rich. While wool was being consumed in our house like bread,75 you were the one making my clothes cheaper. The son of Adad-iddinam, (20) whose father is (only) an underling of my father, has \recei\ved two new garments, (but) you keep getting upset over just one garment for me. Whereas you (25) gave birth to me, his mother [acquirjed him by adoption,76 (30) but whereas his mother loves him, you do not love me.
Divine Revelations
APPENDIX
T h e following letters from G. Dossin, ARM, x (TCL, x x x i , 1967) were published too late for inclusion in the original mantl·· script They are arranged, as above, according to the distinction of laity (k-t), ecstatics (see p, lines 22 ff.), apilum/apiltum (u-w), and—a new category—qamatum (x). A translation of a selection of these letters by G. Dossin may be found in La divination en Mesopotamie ancienne et dans les regions voisines, XIV* Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale (Paris, 1966), 8285 (hereafter, La divination). Our disagreements in readings and interpretation are not noted here; for a discussion of them together with a fuller treatment of these new texts, see the translator's article in Biblica, L (1969), 15-56.

She sends this and letters l-o, t to her husband. That the words of the unnamed man and woman, who are so prominent in this letter, were considered revelations in some sense is clear from their being designated "word, utterance" (with oracular significance, Akk. igerr&m, lines 6, 10) and, implicitly, "signs, portents" (line 4). However, why they were so esteemed remains obscure.

and the (oracular) word was very favorable to my lord. Similarly, I inquired of the man and woman with regard to Ishme-Dagan78, (10) and the (oracular) word concerning him was not favorable. As to the report on him, he has been placed under the foot of my lord. Thus they (spoke): "My lord raised the humasum19 to IshmeDagan, (15) saying, 'I shall beat you (in a contest) with the humasum. Just wrestle and I shall beat you in wrestling.' " Thus I (spoke): "Is my lord approaching battle?" Thus they (spoke): (20) "No battle will be fought. Right after arriving his (Ishme-Dagan's) auxiliary troops will be scattered, (25) and they will cut off the he[ad of Ishme]-Dagan and then put it under the foot of my lord. Thus (my lord will say): 'The army of IshmeDagan is large, and if I [amV]?,80 (30) will his auxiliary forces be sca[tt]ered from him? They have hemmed in my own auxiliary forces.'81 It is Dagan, Adad, Itur-Mer and Belet-ekallim—and Adad is indeed the lord of decision—who are march[ing] at the side of my lord.82 (35) Heaven forbid that my lord should s[ay] this, 'With arms I [must defeat t]hem.'"

An otherwise unknown cult-player seems to have been granted a revelation by the goddess Annunitum regarding an enemy (Hammurabi of Babylon?) of the king. It was not only very favorable, but it agreed with the report that the queen had received when on the same question she had made inquiries on her own, in all probability from the haruspex. This remarkable coincidence is urged as confirmation of the trustworthiness of the oracle.

A disturbing dream of years back has returned, and this is made all the more ominous by a recent warning of an ecstatic which indicates the king is in danger.
Speak to my lord: Thus Addu-duri your maid-servant. Since the peace of your father's house86 I have never had this dream. These were my signs before. In my dream I entered the temple of Belet-ekallim and Belet-ekallim (10) was not in residence nor the statues before her present. And I saw this and went on weeping. This dream of mine was in the evening-watch.87 Again (I dreamt) and Dada, the priest (15) of Ishtar-pishra,88 was on duty in the gate of Belet-ekallim, and an eery voice was crying this over and over, saying: "Come back, O Dagan!

Thus he (spoke): (10) "Did you head up (or) down?"88 Thus I (spoke): "Down, and I came here and did not find my girl. When (15) my lord went to Andariq, the very image of my girl appeared here with Sammetar, and I went to him and he gave [me] his consent. (20) Again he broke faith with me and did not give me my girl." Dagan said this to me. Thus he (spoke): "Until the time Zimri-Lim frees your girl, no one (25) will release (her) to you." Now, in accordance with the wrath of Dagan, my lord must not detain my girl.

If iulmum on the last line of the reverse refers to the king's health, and not to greetings from him, then the dream may deal by implication with this subject and perhaps the girl was supposed to be endowed with healing powers. 96 A city between Terqa and Emar on the Middle Euphrates; see M. Burke, RA, LV (1961), 147-151. 97 Since she does not seem to have accompanied the girl, this can only mean that the kidnapers did not come into Ganibatum. 98 That is, go north into the Upper Country, or south towards Mari. She seems to have got at least as far as Terqa where this letter seems to have been written.

Assignment to a New Lessor
of Land Abandoned in the
Egyptian Rebellion
of 4 1 0 B . C .
This is one of a collection of documents and fragments of documents, written on leather and enclosed in a leather bag, which were acquired by the late Ludwig Borchardt in Egypt They were first studied by a group of scholars who were living in Berlin in the early 1930's. A typewritten study by those scholars was acquired by the Bodleian Library (Oxford) from Borchardt's executors together with the documents in 1943-44 and was utilized by G. R. Driver, who published them as Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B.C. in 1954 and, in a revised edition, but without the fragments and without the photographic plates, in 1957. This particular letter, numbered VIII by Driver, had meanwhile been published in Bulletin of the Faculty of Arts, Cairo, x/2, 113-30, by Murad Kamil, w h o had had access to a photograph of it. The sender of the letter, Arsames, was the Persian satrap of Egypt (and of Babylonia and Transeuphrates as well?) in the last two decades of the fifth century в.с. It may have been written less than a year after the rebellion to which it refers, and it probably originated in Babylon, which is named in some of the other letters. Arsames is known (see p. 492a) to have been absent from Egypt during, and for a couple of years after, the rebellion.
(outside) (1) From Arsames to the officer Nakht-Hor the Comptroller and his colleagues the accountants in Egypt.
(inside) (1) From Arsames to Nakht-Hor the Comptroller and his colleagues.
Now, Petosiri (as he is called), a forester, a servant of mine, has written to me as follows: "In the matter of1 [my father] Pamun (as he [was called). When] (2) the rebellion occurred in Egypt, in the course of it my father the said Pamun (as he was called) perished and the2 farm occupied by him, measuring a seed requirement8 of 30 ardabs, was abandoned; for our staff4 pe[rished] to a man. [Therefore, let them assign] (3) the farm of my father Pamun to me. Take thought on my behalf: let them assign it to me to occupy." Arsames, therefore, commands thus: If the facts accord with the above statement of Petosiri in his letter to [me concerning] his father the said [Pamun] (4) (as he was called)—if he did perish together with [his] st[aff]4 when the rebellion occurred in Egypt, [and] the farm of his father [the said] Pamun, measuring a seed requirement* of 30 ardabs, was abandoned—and if it has (5) not been (re)joined [to my estate] and assigned by me to another servant of mine, then I hereby assign the farm of the said Pamun to Petosiri. You5 for your part advise him (thus): Let him occupy it and let him pay (6) the land-tax to my estate just as it was formerly paid by his father Pamun. (7) Artohi is cognizant of this order; Rasht is the clerk.

Dumuzi and Inanna
PRIDE OF PEDIGREE
This poem, which consists largely of a dialogue between Inanna and Dumuzi, begins with a boastful address by the goddess intended to impress her husband-to-be with the importance of her family for his well-being (lines 1-6). Dumuzi's answer, gende but firm, is that his family is as good as Inanna's (lines 7-22). But this little quarrel serves only to arouse their passion for each other and they proceed to indulge their love (lines 2330). There follows a tender and poetic tete-a-tete between the two which seems to further stimulate their love, but the passage is allusive and metaphorical in character, and its meaning is far from clear (lines 31-45). For text and transliteration, cf. for the present PAPS, Vol. 107, No. 6, 1963, pp. 493-95.
"Without my mother, you would be driven into street (and) . . . -plain, Young man, without my mother, you would be driven into street (and) . . . -plain, Without my mother Ningal, you would be driven into street (and) . . . -plain, Without the 'Lady of the Holy Reed' you would be driven into street (and) . . . -plain, Without Father Sin, you would be driven into street (and) . . . -plain, Without my brother Utu, you would be driven into street (and) . . . -plain."
"Young lady, do not start a quarrel, Inanna, let us talk it over, Inanna, do not start a quarrel, Ninegalla1 let us take counsel together. (10) My father is as good as your father, Inanna, let us talk it over; My mother is as good as your mother, Ninegalla, let us take counsel together; Geshtinanna is as good as . . . ,2 Inanna, let us talk it over; I am as good as Utu, Ninegalla, let us take counsel together; Enki is as good as Sin, Inanna, let us talk it over; (20) Sirtur is as good as Ningal, Ninegalla, let us take counsel together."
1 Ninegalla, "queen of the palace" (cf. also lines 14, 18, and 22), is an epithet of Inanna. 2 Dumuzi is probably comparing his sister Geshtinanna to Inanna's sister (the name is only partially preserved), although Inanna had not mentioned the latter.
The word they had spoken, it is a word of desire,* With the starting of a quarrel comes the desire of her heart. He of the shuba-stones, he of the x/iw^a-s tones, plows the shuba-stoncs*
Amaushumgalanna, he of the shuba-stones, plows the shuba- stones,
He of the shuba-s tones . . . , He of the shuba-s tones . . . , . . . who fills the water of the roof, fills for her the water of the roof, . . . who fills the water of the walls, fills for her the water of the walls. (30)
[His] wife, [the hierodule], says to Amaushumgalanna : "[Plow] the shuba-s tones, plow the shuba-s tones, who (else) will plow them for her?5 Amaushumgalanna, plow the shuba-sx.0rit.sy who (else) will plow them for her? Of the \nd\-shuba-stones, of the [na-shuba-stones], their small ones on the . . . -face of the melam, Of the [na-shuba-stones, of the na-shuba-stones], their large ones are the holy breast of the melam." Amaushumgalanna answers the hierodule: "Who is a hierodule, my wife who is a hierodule, Holy Inanna, he who is not — will plow them for her." He of the na-shuba-stoncs, he of the na-shuba-s tones plows the shuba-s tones, Amaushumgalanna, he of the na-shuba-s tones plows the shuba-stones. (40) "Plow the shuba-stones, plow the shuba-s tones, who (else) will plow them for her?6 Amaushumgalanna, plow the shuba-stowts, who (else) will plow them for her? Of him who was made for me, of him who was made for me, his beard is lapis lazuli, Who was made by An for me, his beard is lapis lazuli; . . . his beard is lapis lazuli, his beard is lapis lazuli."
3 Lines 23 and 24, if the translation is correct, contain what seems to be a proverbial comment on the psychological value of a lover's quarrel. 4 T h e obscure references to plowing the shuba-stoncs in this line and lines 26, 27, 28, 32, 53, 39, 40, 41, and 42 and to the na-shubastones in lines 33, 34, 35, 39 and 40 are probably metaphorical expressions for sexual intercourse. 5 In lines 32, 33, 38, 41, 42 the "her" probably refers to Inanna, although it is the goddess who is speaking, and we might therefore have expected "me" instead. ' L i n e s 41-45 are all assumed to be part of Inanna's speech and her queries (lines 41-42) therefore remain unanswered by Dumuzi.

LOVE IN THE GIPAR
This narrative poem is divided into two stanzas by the rubric s a - g i d - d a - a m (line 25). The first six lines are quite obscure; the remainder of the first stanza is taken up with a detailed account of Inanna's bedecking the various parts of her body with precious stones, jewels, and ornaments, which she selects from what seems to be a treasure-heap brought to her by a "date-gathering" devotee. The second stanza tells of the meeting between the bejeweled Inanna and Dumuzi in the Eanna of Erech, a meeting which so fills Inanna with desire and passion that she sends a special messenger to her father (no doubt the god Sin) with the request that he (that is, perhaps, her father) make her house "long" so that she and her lover can take their pleasure in it For a transliteration and translation of the text which was published in TRS, N o . 70, cf. PAPS, Vol. 107, N o . 6, pp. 495-97.

1 "Ribbons" attempts to render n i g - s a l - l a , perhaps literally "narrow things." 2 "Eardrops" attempts to render i g - s u - u b - a g - a , "that which presses." 8 The objects mentioned in lines 18 and 19 cannot be identified from the literal meaning of the descriptive phrases used for them.
She picks "the house which . . . ," puts it on her . . ., She picks cypress (and) boxwood, the lovely wood, puts them on her navel, (20) She picks a sweet "honey well," puts it about her loins, She picks bright alabaster, puts it on her anus, She picks black — willow, puts it on her vulva, She picks ornate sandals, puts them on her feet.

The maid, singing, sent a messenger to her father, Inanna, dancing, sent a messenger to her father: "My house? my house, let him make it 'long' for me, I the queen—my house, my house let him make it 'long' for me, My gipar-house let him make it 'long' for me, The people will set up my fruitful bed, (40) They will cover it with plants (the color of) durulapis lazuli, I will bring there my sweetheart, I will bring there Amaushumgalanna, He will put his hand by my hand, He will put his heart by my heart, His putting of hand to hand—its sleep is so refreshing, His pressing of heart to heart—its pleasure is so sweet."

(The beginning of this Dumuzi-Inanna myth is fragmentary, and little can be made of its contents; it seems to begin with an account of a marriage ceremony, and continues with an address of obscure meaning in the Emesal dialect by a female deity, presumably Inanna. The narrative seems to begin again with col. i 20, but
4 The meaning of lines 32 and 33 is obscure. 6 T h e rendering "house" (lines 37 ff.) assumes that m a is a variant reading for g £, a synonym of 6 "house."

it is not until line 25 that the text becomes intelligible, we then learn that Dumuzi has come to Inanna's house with gifts of fat, milk, and beer, and pleads for admittance [col. i 25-31].)

(Following a break of uncertain size, we find Inanna going for advice to her mother who urges her strongly to "open the house" for Dumuzi since he will be like a father and mother to her [col. ii 1-11]. Whereupon Inanna prepared herself to meet Dumuzi as befits a Sumerian queenly bride, washing, anointing and bedecking herself, and not failing to take along her dowry and seal [col. ii 12-17]; she opens the door for Dumuzi and they embrace and cohabit [col. ii 18-22].)

The lady directed her step, Opened the door for Dumuzi, In the house she came forth to him like the light of the moon, (20) Gazed at him, rejoiced for him, Embraced him . . . .
(Following another break in the text we find Dumuzi addressing Inanna and inviting her to accompany him to his god's house where she will be treated with great honor [col. iii 8-13].)
The shepherd Dumuzi says to his wife: "My wife, . . . his coming forth Inanna, . . . the house of my god, I will bring you to the house of my god,
You will lie before my god, You, inanna will sit at the seat of honor of my god."
(What follows then is entirely obscure since the remainder of col. iii and much of col. iv are largely destroyed, except for a passage in which Dumuzi is addressing some individual or deity whom he is placing in charge over a city described as an "assembly" city, with instructions to refrain from certain actions (presumably) harmful to his wife, [col. iv 6-17].)
It is an [assembly city], your city is an assembly city, I have put you in charge over the assembly city, Your city . . . it is an assembly city, I have put you in charge . . . , I did not put my mother . . . in charge of it, I did not put [my] brother . . . in charge of it, I did not put my sister Geshtinanna in charge of it, It is you . .. whom I have put in charge of it. Do not lay a hand on my wife, Do not . . . , Do not build . . . , Do not . . . ,
THE ECSTASY OF LOVE
The formal structure of this tender and ardent love song is rather unusual It consists of two soliloquies by the goddess separated from each other by a brief tete-i-tete between the goddess and her lover Dumuzi; the first soliloquy and its ensuing tete-a-tete make up the first stanza, designated by the scribe as a sagidda, while the second soliloquy takes up the entire second stanza, designated by the scribe as a sagarra. In Inanna's first soliloquy (obv. lines 1-8), the goddess relates that one night, while she was innocently singing and dancing about, presumably in heaven, Dumuzi met her, held her hand, and embraced her. There follows a brief dialogue between them consisting of Inanna's plea (obv. lines 9-12) to Dumuzi to let go of her since on coming home she will have to deceive her mother and she does not know how, and Dumuzi's suggestion (obv. lines 13-22) to tell her mother that she whiled away the hours with a girl friend in the public square, an excuse that will enable them to spend the night making love by the moonlight The extant part of Inanna's second soliloquy which is rather elliptical and allusive, begins with an exulting pronouncement of her arrival at the "gate" of her mother Ningal accompanied by Dumuzi who "will say the word" to her, that is, no doubt, ask for her daughter's hand (rev. lines 4-13); it concludes with an ecstatic eulogy of her husband-to-be and the fertility insured by their sacred marriage (rev. lines 14-21). For a transliteration and translation of the text which was published in TuMNF, 111, No. 25, cf. PAPS, V o l 107, No. 6, pp. 499-501.

It is a sagarra. A tigi-song of Inanna.
thus: Kuli-Anna (line 6), Ushumgalanna (line 8), Kuli-Enlil (line io), and Amaushumgalanna (lines 15, 17, 20). 2 "Come now" for m e - a is a guess based on the context. 8 To judge from this line Inanna had a long-standing reputation for deceit, a fact which might be surmised from Gilgamesh's characterization of the goddess in Tablet VI of the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh. 4 The meaning of this line is quite uncertain and the translation is highly dubious. 6 'Indulge (our) passion" attempts to render e - n e - s u - u d - b i d a - e, a complex (or perhaps two complexes) which is difficult to analyze grammatically. ® It is difficult to see why the poet uses - m e , "our," instead of - m u , "mine."
Inanna and the King
BLESSING ON THE WEDDING NIGHT
This poem is an epithalamion in the Emesal dialect which is in some respects a companion piece to the last stanza of the Inanna hymn that celebrates the hieros-gamos between King Iddin-Dagan and the goddess. T h e poet begins with an address, probably to the goddess Inanna, informing her that Gibil had purified for her "the great shrine" in her Eanna temple, and that the king had erected an altar and carried out the lustration rites for her (col. i 1-12); this is followed by a prayer that in the evening when "the day had gone to sleep," and it was time for the goddess "to caress the lord" in the favored sleeping place, she should give the king life and the staff and crook (col. i lines 13-17). T h e poet then sings of the preparation of the "sleeping place" of kingship and queenship which "rejoices the heart" and "sweetens the lap" (col. i lines 18-31). After a break we find Inanna speaking to the king(?) "words of life, words of long days" (col. ii lines 1-3). Following which Ninshubur takes him by his right forearm(?), leads him to Inanna's lap, and asks her to bless him with everything essential for the well-being of the king and his people: a good reign, a firmly founded throne, a well-governing scepter, a staff and crook for the control of Sumer and A k k a d and the lands beyond (col. ii lines 4-18); she should grant him, too, that "he (the king) like a farmer set the fields in order, like a faithful shepherd multiply the sheepfolds" (coL ii lines 19-20); and that under his reign, the land should have all it need: plants and grains, overflow by the rivers, late grain in the fields, fish and birds in the marshes, fresh and mature reeds in the canebrake, mashgur-tre.es in the plains, deer and wild-goats in the forest, honey and wine in the well-watered gardens, vegetables in the trenches (between the furrows), long life in the palace, high water brought by the Tigris and Euphrates to make verdant their banks and watered acres, grain heaps and mounds piled high by the goddess Nidaba (col. ii line 18-col. iii line 4). Following a further request by Ninshubur that the king be allowed to spend a long time in Inanna's lap (col. iii lines 5-6), the king proceeds with "lifted head" to the lap of Inanna and is embraced by her (col. iii lines 7-12).

(col. i)
u. . . ,
Of the house of Eridu—its guidance, Of the house of Sin—its radiance, Of the Eanna—its habitation; The house—it has been presented (to you). (In) my enduring house which floats like a cloud, (Whose) name in truth, is a goodly vision, (Where) a fruitful bed, lapis-bedecked, Gibil had purified for you in the great shrine, He who is well-suited for 'queenship,' (io) The lord has erected his altar, In his reed-filled house which he has purified for you, he performs your rites.
The sun has gone to sleep, the day has passed, As in bed you gaze (lovingly) upon him, As you caress the lord, Give life unto the lord, Give the staff and crook unto the lord."

Ninshubur, the trustworthy vizier of the Eanna, Took him by his right forearm, Brought him blissfully to the lap of Inanna: "May the lord whom you have called to (your) heart, The king, your beloved husband, enjoy long days at your holy lap, the sweet, Give him a reign favorable (and) glorious, Give him the throne of kingship on its enduring foundation, (10) Give him the people-directing scepter, the staff (and) the crook, Give him an enduring crown, a diadem which ennobles the head, From (where) the sun rises, to (where) the sun sets, From south to north, From the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, From (where grows) the halub-tree to (where grows) the cedar, Over all Sumer and Akkad give him the staff (and) the crook, May he exercise the shepherdship of the blackheads (wherever) they dwell, May he make productive the fields like the farmer, May he multiply the sheepfolds like a trustworthy shepherd.

Dumuzi and Inanna
PRAYER FOR WATER AND BREAD
This rather obscure and heterogeneous composition designated as a s i r - n a m - s u b ' i n a n n a - k a m , 1 is divided into four sections of uneven length. In the first, which consists entirely of a monologue by Inanna (lines 1-18), the goddess speaks of journeying to the Abzu, and to Eridu and its shrines and gods, bringing with her animals and trees. T h e second section, too, is a monologue by Inanna (lines 19-35), in it the goddess tells of her bringing water (probably) to the marshland, and boasts of her prowess in battle and of uttering a challenge to Utu, Nanna, and Sud. T h e third section (lines 36-47) seems to be a narrative passage concerned primarily with the Euphrates, whither Enki, Damgalnunna and Asarluhi had gone, presumably with Inanna, and where Enlil was eating and drinking.2 The fourth section (lines 48-77), obscure as it is, is of significance for the DumuziInanna marriage ceremony. Following what seems to be a brief soliloquy by Inanna, concerned with the preparation of a marriage bed, presumably by the king (lines 48-51), the "linen wearers" address the king, before whom food and drink had been placed, as Dumuzi, announce to him in riddle-like phrases the presence of Inanna, and invite him to approach the goddess, as well as the place in the ^/«r-shrine where Enlil seems to have been stationed (lines 52-65). Inanna then seems to pronounce a prayer for the life and rule of the king (lines 66-69). T h e composition closes with a plea to Inanna, perhaps by the king himself, to give him her breast from which he will drink as a symbol of the fertility of the land (lines 70-77).8
1 F o r this rubric cf. Falkenstein, ZA, XLIX, 86, note 4. 2 T h e real meaning and implication of this section are quite obscure, and it is difficult to relate it to what precedes and follows. 8 The assumed shift of speakers in this passage (Inanna for lines 48-51, the "linen-weavers" for lines 56-65, Inanna for lines 66-69, the king for lines 70-77) is far from assured.

T h e contents of this myth, inscribed on a four-column tablet of which little more than half is preserved, may be tentatively sketched as follows: The text begins with a long monologue by



SUMERIAN SACRED MARRIAGE TEXTS
Inanna in which, following a fragmentary, obscure passage (col. i lines 1-21), she proceeds to recount her appointment of Dumuzi to die "godship" of Sumer, her bridal preparations for the ensuing marriage, and the singing and rejoicing which accompanied their union (col. i line 22-col. ii line 9). T h e text as well as the transliteration and the translation was published in PAPS, V o l 107, No. 6, pp. 505-08.
(col. i) "I gazed on all the people, Called Dumuzi to the godship of the Land. Dumuzi, the beloved of Enlil, My mother holds ever dear, My father exalts him. I bathed, scoured myself with soap, (And) after putting a linen cloth over the (freshly) bathed s\in,

(The text continues with a brief and fragmentary narrative passage ending with a statement by the poet that Inanna composed a song to her vulva [col. ii lines 10-17]).

(The song itself follows: Inanna compares her vulva to, among other things, fallow land, a field, and a hillock, and ends by asking who will plow it for her [col. ii lines 18-28]).
"The vulva it is . . . , Like a horn i t . . . at the large wagon, It is the 'Boat of Heaven,' fastening ropes . . ., Like the new crescent, passion . . . , It is fallow land, in the plain . . ., It is a field, which the «z-bird . . . the «z-bird,

(To this query comes the answer given probably by Dumuzi himself, that it is he, the king Dumuzi, who will plow it for her, and, accordingly, in the very next line Inanna urges him to do so [col. ii lines 29-31]).
"Lady, the king will plow it for you, Dumuzi, the king, will plow it for you." "Plow my vulva, my sweetheart."
(Following another fragmentary passage pertaining to the sexual union of the couple comes a detailed description of the ensuing vegetation [col. ii line 31-col. iii line

"Lettuce Is My Hair"
A LOVE-SONG FOR SHU-SIN
This text consists of a song purportedly chanted by a lu\urpriestess1 in connection with the hieros-gamos between Shu-Sin, in the role of Dumuzi, and the goddess Inanna, whom she may have represented in the ceremony.2 The hierodule first sings of her lettuceMike hair that seemed to have been especially set for the occasion (lines 1-8). She then sings of her coming before Shu-Sin, himself,4 but unfortunately this passage is largely destroyed (lines 9 ff.). She concludes with an ecstatic and loving invocation of the king ending in a wishful blessing for his life (lines 18-22).® The text, transliteration and translation have been published in PAPS, Vol. 107, No. 6, p. 508 and Fig. 5.

PAPS, V o l . 107, N o . 6, pp. 489-90. 3 The comparison of hair with lettuce may have had "fertility" significance. 4 Note the designation of Shu-Sin, the husband-to-be as "brother." 5 Note the rather extravagant imagery in the description of Shu-Sin as "silver (and) lapis lazuli" (line 19).

"Life Is Your Coming"
THE KING AS BROTHER AND SON-IN-LAW
This poem seems to be a song chanted by a chorus of \u\urpriestesses to Shu-Sin,1 probably on the occasion of a hierosgamos celebration. It begins with a passage consisting primarily of a series of epithets of the king, some of which, such as "the ensi of the magur-boat," and "the nubanda of the chariot," are rather unusual and unexpected (lines 1-12). The remainder of the song (lines 13-16) is a jubilant invocation to the king as the bridegroom bringing life and abundance to the "house." The texts from which this poem was pieced together were published in UET, vi, Part 2, No. 122, and in PAPS, Vol. 107, No. 6, Figs. 5 and 9; the transliteration and translation were published in PAPS, Vol. 107, No. 6, p. 510.

1 Note, however, that the king's name is not mentioned in the text. 2 T h e title ensi usually refers to the governor of a city. 3 T h e title nubanda usually designates a high palace official. 4 "Father" in this and the following line may refer to the god Nanna-Sin, if the singers are speaking for Inanna, w h o was his daughter. 5 "Our mother" may refer to Ningal, the wife of Nanna-Sin, and mother of Inanna.

Lying with you is the greatest joy, My sweet . . . . It is a balbale of Inanna.
"The Honey-man"
LOVE-SONG TO A KING
This song, too,1 was no doubt chanted by a /«^«r-priestess2 in connection with the hieros-gamos, although the name of the participating king is not mentioned in the text. Instead, he is described in sensuous, concrete, fertility imagery: he is lettuce planted by the water, a well-stocked garden, luxuriant grain in the furrow, a fruit-bearing apple tree, and above all, a "honeyman" who sweetens her body, or rather that of the goddess Inanna whom she represents. Structurally, the poem may be divided into three parts: ( i ) an initial four-line strophe characterized by "vegetation" symbolism and an identical refrain for three of its lines; (2) a four-line "honeyman" strophe with an identical refrain for three of its lines; (3) a summary two-line strophe ending in the refrain characteristic of the first strophe. T h e text was pieced together from tablets published in TRS, xv, No. 20, and UET, vi, Part 1, No. 121. A transliteration and translation were published in PAPS, Vol. 107, No. 6, pp. 508-09.
He has sprouted, he has burgeoned, he is lettuce planted
by the water, My well-stocked garden of the . . . plain, my favored of
the womb,
My grain luxuriant in its furrow—he is lettuce planted by the water, My apple tree which bears fruit up to (its) top—he is lettuce planted by the water.
The "honey-man," the "honey-man" sweetens me ever, My lord, the "honey-man" of the gods, my favored of
the womb,
Whose hand is honey, whose foot is honey, sweetens me ever. Whose limbs are honey sweet, sweetens me ever.
My sweetener of the . . . navel, [my favored of the
womb],
My . . . of the fair thighs, he is lettuce [planted by the water]. (10) It is a balbale of Inanna.8
1 cf. "Lettuce is my Hair: A Love-Song for Shu-Sin," p. 644. 2 Note, however, the rather surprising fact that it is not written in the Emesal dialect. 8 T h e text actually reads "they are t w o balbale of Inanna," since one of the tablets was inscribed with another poem (not translated here).
"Set Me Free, My Sister"
THE SATED LOVER
As far as can be determined at present, the extant part of this poem consists of several speeches. Lines 21-22 end an address to Inanna by some female deity1 informing her of some of the virtues and prerogatives presented to her. This is followed by a soliloquy on the part of Inanna reminiscent of "Inanna and Dumuzi: The Ecstasy of Love"2 in which she chants of meeting her beloved, further designated here as "brother," and "my brother of fairest face,"8 and uniting with him in love so much so that he became "sated" (lines 23-34). The remainder of the poem (lines 35-38) consists of the lover's plea to Inanna, to "set him free," so that he can return with her to the palace where she will be treated as a "young daughter" by the father.4 A transliteration and translation of the poem, as well as the texts on which it is based, were published in PAPS, Vol. 107, No. 6, pp. 509-10, and Figs. 6, 7, and 8.
" . . . , sweet allure, My holy Inanna, I presented to you."
"As . . . the beloved of my eye, My beloved met me, Took his pleasure of me, rejoiced together with me. The brother brought me to his house Made me lie on its . . . honey bed, My precious sweet, having lain by my heart, In unison, the 'tongue-making' in unison, My brother of fairest face, made 50 times. (30) I . . . for him like a weakling, I set it up for him in the .. . together with . . . from the earth, My brother who . . . in his anger, My precious sweet is sated with me."
"Set me free, my sister, set me free, Come, my beloved sister, I would go to the palace, You will be a little daughter before my father, I will set free for you .. . ."
It is a balbale of Inanna.
1 Judging from the fact that it is written in the Emesal dialect. 2 Cf. pp. 639-40. 8 "Of fairest face" renders i - b i - S a g s - S a g s , a frequendy used epithet of Dumuzi. 4 If, as is more than likely, it is Dumuzi speaking, the "father" would refer to Enki (cf. "Inanna and Dumuzi: Pride and Pedigree," pp. 63738).

Sumerian Miscellaneous Texts
TRANSLATOR: S. N. KRAMER
The Curse of Agade
THE EKUR AVENGED
This rather unusual "historiographic"1 document, first composed (probably) about 2000 B.C.2 by a Sumerian theologian-poet with a reflective and inventive turn of mind, is of significance for the history of religious thought. Its central theme concerns national catastrophe as a direct consequence of divine wrath kindled by a defiant act on the part of man. In the case of Sumer, the disastrous catastrophe came in the guise of a humiliating and destructive invasion by the barbarous, ruthless Gutians from the Zagros ranges, that brought confusion and anarchy in the land for about a century or so.8 This cruel event preyed on the hearts and minds of the more thoughtful and literate of the Sumerians, and pressed for an explanation within the framework of the Sumerian world view. It is this need for a satisfying rationale which seems to have led to the composition of the document by a deeply religious poet4 imbued with the conviction that it was the desecration of Sumer's holiest shrine by a bitter and defiant king which led to the calamity that overwhelmed the king's capital city and the land as a whole. The culprit chiefly responsible for this catastrophe, according to our author, was Naram-Sin, the fourth king of the Dynasty of Akkad, that ruled from its capital, the still unlocated city of Agade. TTie founder of the dynasty was Sargon the Great, Naram-Sin's grandfather. According to our author, Sargon's rise to power was due to Enlil, the leading deity of the Sumerian pantheon, who turned over both the temporal and religious control of Sumer, after Kish and Erech, its two great political centers, had been destroyed by the angered god (lines 1-6).5 But it was primarily the goddess Inanna who devoted all her efforts to make Agade a prosperous and affluent city whose sway over Sumer, and indeed over virtually the endre ancient world, was supreme and unchallenged, and especially so when NaramSin began his reign (lines 7-53). But then, our author continues, Inanna, acting, it seems, in accordance with "the word of the Ekur," that is presiitnably, the word of Enlil,® abandoned her shrine Eulmash in Agade and
1 "Historiographic" as here used, denotes a type of poetic narrative composition concerned with some significant historical event interpreted in a style and manner consonant with the Sumerian world view. 2 The tablets themselves, like virtually all the Sumerian literary documents translated in this book, date from the 18th century B.C. But many of them are known to go back to the period of the Third Dynasty of Ur, when literature flourished throughout Sumer, especially in the edubbds, or academies of Ur and Nippur. There is no way of knowing just when the "Curse of Agade" was first composed, but it is hardly likely that it was more than a century or two after the reign of Naram-Sin. 3 The Gutian catastrophe that overtook Sumer is a matter of substantiated historical record. What is uncertain is the time of the first significant Gutian incursion into Sumer, but scholars now tend to the opinion that it was towards the end of the reign of Naram-Sin (cf. Finkelstein's succinct summary in PAPS, V o l . 107, N o . 6, p. 467 and especially note 25 where the essential bibliographical references will be found). 4 It is not unlikely that he was a product of the Nippur edubba established by Shulgi, the second ruler of the Third Dynasty of Ur (cf. my forthcoming "Shulgi of Ur: A Royal Hymn and a Divine Blessing" in JQR). 5 The reference here is probably to Sargon's victory over Ur-Zababa of Kish, and Lugalzaggesi, originally of Sumer who made Erech his capital (cf. S. N. Kramer, The Sumerians, pp. 58 i f . ) . ®The "word of Enlil" was often a harbinger of destruction, since
turned inimical to the city (lines 54-65). At the same time some of the other gods—Ninurta, Utu, and Enki—deprived the city of the powers and endowments they had conferred upon it, and Agade became weak and impoverished (lines 66-84). At first Naram-Sin, according to our author,7 accepted this cruel fate in humility and self-abasement, especially after he had a highly mysterious vision concerned with the Ekur (lines 85-90). But when after seven years of this contrite behavior, he sought an oracle from the Ekur in Nippur,8 and was not granted his request his humility turned to defiance (lines 91-98). He mobilized his troops and proceeded to devastate the Ekur, desecrate its holy places, and despoil it of its possessions (lines 97-144). But no sooner had he done so, our document continues, than the angered Enlil began to avenge the destruction of his beloved Ekur. He brought down from their mountain lairs, the Gutians, an uncivilized, uncontrollable, muldtudinous horde who spread over the land like swarming locusts, and brought about the suspension of all avenues of communication by land or sea (lines 145-169). Cities became desolate; fields and gardens were abandoned; famine raged, and death stalked the inhabitants of Sumer (lines 170-191). The land was filled with wailing, lamenting, hair-tearing, and bodily laceration, but Enlil turned a deaf ear to the people's suffering; he went into his cella, and laid himself down to sleep (lines 192-208). It was then that some of the great gods of Sumer9 decided to mollify Enlil, and thus presumably save Sumer from total destruction,10 by pronouncing a terrible oath against Agade, dooming her to a fate worse than that inflicted by her on Nippur: she would become a city deprived of all human friendship and filled with wailing and lamentation; all its holy places would be destroyed, and starvation and desolation would be rampant; she would become a place unfit for human habitation (lines 209-269). And, concludes our author, that is just what happened: Agade was destroyed, and became a desolate uninhabitable ruin.11
So much for the contents of this remarkable composition. Stylistically, the author depends primarily on cumulative parallelism for poetic effect; there is virtually no repetition of lines,
it was Enlil (or the composite deity An-Enlil) w h o , according to the Sumerian theologians, carried out the decrees of the divine assembly to transfer the political power from one city to another, cf., e.g., Enlil's response to Nanna-Sin's plea for his city Ur in the "Lamentation Over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur," lines 361-372 (see pages 611-19). 7 There is no w a y of k n o w i n g whether this assertion had any basis in fact, or whether, as seems more probable, it was sheer imagination on the part of the author. 8 T h e city is not actually mentioned by name, but it seems hardly likely that "the house" and "the built house" of lines 93-94 refer to any other temple than the Ekur of Nippur. 9 These "great gods" were Sin of Ur, Enki of Eridu, Inanna of Erech, Ninurta of Nippur, Ishkur of Ennigi, Utu of Larsa, Nidaba, the patron deity of writing, and Nusku, Enlil's vizier in the Ekur. But just why the author selected these, and only these deities to pronounce a curse against Agade, or w h y he listed them in that special order is not too clear. But note the fact that Nanna-Sin of Ur is first on the list, which may be taken as further proof that our document was first composed sometime during the Third Dynasty of Ur, when that city was the capital of Sumer. 10 The deliverance of Sumer from the Gutians is nowhere referred to in the composition, but it is not unreasonable to surmise that this took place soon after the avenging of the Ekur and the destruction of Agade. 11 T h e total destruction of Agade is confirmed by the fact that the city is not mentioned in any of the thousands of Ur III documents published to date.

the device so characteristic of Sumerian hymnography.12 Nor does it make use of long speeches, static epithets, recurrent formulas, and other stylistic techniques that are earmarks of the Sumerian myth or epic tale. Next to parallelism, our poet's major poetic device is the simile. Similes of one kind or another are found in virtually all of the Sumerian literary works, but in "The Curse of Agade" they are used far more copiously and imaginatively than in most.1* Fragments belonging to this composition began to be published as early as 1914. By 1944 close to a score of pieces inscribed with parts of the document had been copied and published, but its true character remained unrecognized, primarily because most of the pieces belonged to the first half of the composition. Since much of the available text spoke of the destruction, devastation, and desolation of Agade, it was taken to be a lamentation over the destruction of Agade, although its formal structure differed markedly from the typical Sumerian lamentation. In 1956, however, I had the opportunity of working in the Hilprecht Sammlung of the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, where I identified seven pieces belonging to the composition; one of these was of very special importance, since it contained the last 138 lines, and thus made it possible to recognize the true nature of the composition.14 T h e publication of this new material enabled the eminent Heidelberg cuneiformist, Adam Falkenstein to publish an excellent transliteration of the document based on all the published material.18 There were still, however, quite a number of gaps and misreadings, and most of these could be filled in and corrected with the help of the still unpublished Nippur pieces which Adele Feigenbaum, a graduate student in the Department of Oriental Studies in the University Museum is now in the process of studying and copying as part of her dissertation for the degree of Ph.D. T h e translation here presented is based on the transliteration prepared by her for this purpose.
After the frowning forehead of Enlil Had killed (the people of) Kish like the "Bull of Heaven,"18
12 For two rare cases of the repetition pattern, cf. lines 93-96 and 224-225. 18 Thus, to take only those that are reasonably certain and intelligible: The wrathful Enlil kills the people of Kish "like the Bull of Heaven" (lines 1-2), and grind» the house of Erech to dust "like a giant bull" (line 3). Inanna spends sleepless nights in order to insure the security and prosperity of Agade "like a second son erecting the (wife's) chamber (lines 10-24). King Naram-Sin steps forth on the holy dais of Agade "like the sun" (lines 40-41). The walls of Agade reach skyward "like a mountain" and its gates are opened by Inanna "like the Tigris emptying its waters into the sea" (lines 42-44). The submissive peoples carried their gifts to Inanna "like sack-carrying donkeys" (line 50). Inanna forsakes Agade "like a maiden forsaking her chamber," she goes forth belligerendy against her city "like a warrior hastening to (his) weapon" (lines 61-64). Naram-Sin abuses the Ekur "like a mighty man accustomed to high-handed (action)"; he shows contempt for its giguna "like a runner contemptuous of (his body's) strength"; he erects ladders against the walls of the house "like a bandit who plunders a city" (lines 101 -106). The Ekur is destroyed "like a huge boat"; it is turned into dust "like a mountain mined for silver"; it is cut to pieces "like a mountain of lapis lazuli"; it is prostrated "like a city ravaged by Ishkur" (lines 107-110); it is fallen to the ground "like a man who had been killed in batde" (line 118); its copper lies piled up on the quay "like large (heaps of) grain (ready to be) carried away" (line 1 3 7 ) . The Gutians cover the earth in vast numbers "like locusts" (line 1 5 7 ) . The father who is still left in the death-ridden Agade moans "like a dove in its hole," thrashes about "like a swallow in its cranny," scurries about "like a dove in terror" (lines 218-226). The protecting genii stationed in the Ekur fall prostrate "like huge (fighting) men drunk with wine" (lines 228229). The oxen of Nanna moan in the desolate city "like ghosts who roam the silent places (the cemeteries)" (lines 260-261). 14 Cf. HBS, pp. 226-32. 15 Cf. ZA, Lvn, 43-124, where the pertinent bibliographical details will also be found. 18 For the role of the "Bull of Heaven" in Sumerian mythology, cf. last, Edzard, Die Mythologie der Sumerer und Afyader, p. 79.

After he had ground the house of Erech into dust, like a giant bull, After in due time, to Sargon the king of Agade, From below to above, Enlil Had given him lordship and kingship, Then did holy Inanna, the shrine of Agade, Erect as her noble chamber, In Ulmash did she set up a throne.

"giant bull" in the following line may also refer to some mythological creature, but if so, no recognizable literary evidence pertaining to it has as yet been recognized. 17 "Heads" may refer to devotees of the temple. The Sumerian sag, "head," has a wide semantic range; usually it means "slave," but it can also mean "man" in general. Note, too, the initial sag in sag-ursag, a complex that designates a class of castrated devotees in the service of Inanna, the goddess of love. 18 Marhashi (also written Barhashi), was one of the more menacing enemies of the Agade Dynasty. The translation "into clay" is quite uncertain; there is a variant that reads 'Into the Bull of Heaven," which is altogether unintelligible at the moment. 10 This is a word of uncertain meaning, perhaps it is the Indian humped bull. 20 That is wild dogs perhaps used by princes for the chase. Note that the same "princely dogs" are mentioned in the "Golden Age" passage of "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta" (cf., e.g., HBS, pp. 222-25 and note that the words "wild dog" in the third line of the passage on p. 222 should be corrected to read "princely dog") where the expression is parallel to "wolf." 21 It is uncertain whether anie-\ur-ra is here to be taken literally as "ass of the mountain," or whether it has the meaning "horse" attributed to it in later days. 22 That is, precious metals were so plentiful that even the granaries had to be utilized to store them instead of grain.

66 This rendering is a guess based on the context. 67 The implication of this phrase in the context is uncertain. 68 The "silent places" probably refer to cemeteries. 69 "Evermore" attempts to render the triplication of the root in the verb. 70 T h e usga w a s a part of the temple w h e r e lustrations were carried out, cf., e.g., line 455 of the "Lamentation Over the Destruction of Ur and S u m e r " on p. 619; for a different opinion cf.

71 For the tigi-music cf. note 24. 72 Literally: "for a second time." 78 Literally: "the places where the water is diminished in the river." 74 The text actually has "your," but this is no doubt a scribal error.

Agade, (instead of) its sweet-flowing water, salt water flowed (there), He who said, "I would dwell in that city," found not a good dwelling place there.

A SUMERIAN LULLABY
This composition, the only one of its kind thus far known from the Ancient Near East, probably consists entirely of a chant purported to be uttered by the wife of Shulgi,1 the preeminent and long-lived ruler of the Third Dynasty of Ur, who seemed to have been anxious and troubled by the ill-health of one of her sons. Being a mother's lullaby, one might have expected her to address her words directly to die child. This is true, however, only of the greater part of die poem (cf. lines 6-11, 19-23, 39-63, 92-100). In the other preserved passages she seems to soliloquize about her son in the third person (cf. lines 1-5, 24-38, 64-91), and in one passage she addresses Sleep personified (lines 12-18): In detail the contents of the composition may be sketched as follows: The poem begins with a rather wistful and wishful soliloquy in which the mother seems to reassure herself that as she envisions it in the very chant she is uttering, her son will grow big and sturdy (lines 1-5). She then seems to try to buoy up her son's spirit with the promise of care and oncoming sleep (lines 6-11). Having mentioned sleep, she addresses it directly and urges it to close her son's wakeful eyes as well as his babbling tongue (lines 12-18). She now turns again to her ailing son, and promises to provide him with the sweet little cheeses that will serve to heal him, who is none other than the son of Shulgi (lines 19-23). He will also eat her well-watered lettuce, she continues (lines 24-26). She now sees herself—again while uttering her chant—providing him with loving wife and beloved child nursed and tended by a joyous nursemaid (lines 27-38). Now anxiety about the illness of her son begins to dominate her mood, and in her next soliloquy addressed directly to her son whom she seems to see in her troubled fancy as dead and mourned by professional mourners and crawling insects (lines 39-50). Following a fragmentary passage in which sleep is mentioned once again (lines 51-56), we find the mother blessing her son with a wife and son, abundance of grain, a good angel, a happy and joyous reign (lines 57-63). Following another fragmentary and obscure passage which ends in two lines concerned with a palm-tree (lines 64-91), the mother turns once again to her son and future king, and admonishes him to stand by Ur and Erech, to seize and pinion the enemy, a dog who, unless cowed, will tear him to pieces (lines 92-100): T h e composition is inscribed on a tablet ( U M 29-16-85) excavated by the University of Pennsylvania sometime between 1889
75 The rubric "Praise Inanna" indicates that this composition was dedicated to Inanna.

SUMERIAN MISCELLANEOUS TEXTS
and 1900. To judge from the script, the tablet dates to the first post-Sumerian period in the early second millennium B.C., but there is little doubt that the document was first composed2 during the reign of Shulgi, toward the end of the third millennium. Not unexpectedly, the text of this composition, which is only about half-preserved, proved to be difficult and obscure. After preparing a preliminary transliteration and translation, therefore, I sent them on to Thorkild Jacobsen and Michel Civil for comment. Not a few of their suggestions have been incorporated in the present translation. A detailed edition of the text is to appear in the forthcoming Festschrift to the Italian scholar Elorado Volterra, and the reader will find there an extensive philological commentary, as well as an appendix with a number of variant translations by Thorkild Jacobsen.

2 The author was probably one of the court poets who may have composed it at the queen's behest. 3 In Sumerian, the writing is u 5 - a a - u - a . The exclamation u-5 a is an onomatopoetic word for "lullaby." T h e following a - u - a has the meaning, "ah! woe!" 4 Virtually nothing is k n o w n of the irtna-tree and the sa\ir-plant, except that the former must have been noteworthy for the sturdiness of its roots, and the latter for its luxuriating crown. 8 The meaning of this line and the following three is uncertain and obscure. 6 The interpretation of this crucial passage is far from assured, although the meaning of virtually all the words and complexes is quite certain. Most difficult is line 19, since there seems to be no antecedent for "he," and it is therefore not clear just who it is that fills the child's lap with emmer. Rather strange, too, at least on the surface, is the not very apt characterization of "litde cheeses" as the "healer of man," and the equating of " m a n " with "the son of the Lord Shulgi." 7 The interpretation of lines 24-26 and their connection with what precedes and follows depends largely on the identity of "the Lord" in line 26. The translation assumes that it refers to the child, but it is not impossible that it refers to Shulgi, and if this is the case, the

interpretation of the contents of the three lines and their implication are obscure and enigmatic. 8 The rendering of lines 49-50 and their connection with what precedes and follows are quite uncertain. 9 Ashnan is the goddess of grain and vegetation; hjusu is an epithet whose meaning is uncertain. 10 In line 92, as well perhaps as in the obscure lines 93-94, the mother seems to address her son as a child; in lines 95-100, on the other hand, she thinks of him as fully grown and a reigning king of Sumer. 11 Rendering uncertain.

Canaanite and Aramaic Inscriptions
TRANSLATOR: FRANZ ROSENTHAL
The Northwest Semitic inscriptions originating from the Near East—and to some degree also the Punic inscriptions from Northwest Africa and adjacent Phoenician colonies—are without exception of immediate interest to the student of the Old Testament, for either linguistic or historical reasons. Any selection, therefore, is arbitrary, and no claim is made that the inscriptions translated here are necessarily more important than some others which, for lack of space, have not been presented. For the sake of conciseness, the bibliographical references in connection with the individual inscriptions had to be severely restricted. A more generous hearing is accorded to recent publications. In general, publications conveniendy available to the reader are noted. It was not possible, though in some cases it might have been desirable, to check the original inscriptions or consult photographs and reproductions other than those contained in the available publications.* (See Addenda).
The transcription of proper names is often problematic and, as handled on the following pages, runs the whole gamut from certainty to mere guesswork. The vocalization of some names is made practically certain by contemporary vocalized transcriptions. Of some, it is fairly well indicated by their etymology. Then, again, there are names which admit several possible etymologies, and, finally, there are yet others whose vocalization is unknown. In some cases, the known Masoretic vocalization differs considerably from what can be assumed to have been the contemporary pronunciation. In such cases, the Masoretic vocalization has as a rule been adopted. For the sake of convenience, most of the proper names have been vocalized, and the interested reader will easily know into which of the aforementioned categories each vocalization belongs.
Dr. H. L. Ginsberg kindly looked over my original manuscript and provided helpful suggestions on doubtful points, not all of which, it should be noted, have been passed on here.
Building Inscriptions
YEHIMILK OF BYBLOS
This inscription records the dedication of a new building, possibly a temple, and is now quite generally dated in the tenth century. It was found in Byblos in 1929. Bibliography: M. Dunand, RB, xxxix (1930), pp. 321-31; id., Fouilles de Byblos, Paris 1937-1939, vol. 1, p. xxxi; vol. 2, p. 30; W. F.

A house built by Yehimilk, king of Byblos, who also
has restored all the ruins of the houses here.
May Ba'lshamem and the Lord of Byblos1 and the
Assembly of the Holy Gods of Byblos prolong the days
and years of Yehimilk in Byblos, for (he is) a righteous
king and an upright king before the Holy Gods of
Byblos!
AZITAWADDA OF ADANA
This unusually long inscription comes from a locality called Karatepe situated about thirty-eight miles southwest of Mar ash beside the River Jeyhan. Three versions of the Phoenician text,
1 A correction to "Lady of Byblos," a frequently mentioned deity, has been suggested.
together with some Hittite versions, were discovered in 1946-47. They contain an autobiographical account which king Azitawadda composed on the occasion of the dedication of a citadel and city founded by him. The exact date of the inscriptions is still uncertain and depends on a further study of the archaeological and historical evidence. The text seems to antedate events described in the inscription of Kilamuwa (see no. 3), but at present a much later, eighth-century date cannot be ruled out One version of the inscription is written in four columns on four sides of a statue. Another version starts on a gate lion and is continued on two orthostats. The third version consists of three columns distributed over four orthostats and continued on the bases of the fourth and adjacent orthostats to a gate lion. Cf. the photograph published by Halet Qambel in Oriens, 1 (1948), p. 162, pi. 1. The first, incompletely preserved version was the one first made accessible to scholars by H. T. Bossert, Halet Qambel, and U. Bahadir Alkim. The third version, which is best preserved, is translated here. The numerous publications dealing with it include the following items: H. T.

I am Azitawadda, the blessed of Ba'l,1 the servant of
Ba'l, whom Awariku2 made powerful, king of the
Danunites. Ba'l made me a father and a mother to the Danunites. I have restored the Danunites. I have expanded the country of the Plain of Adana from the rising of the sun to its setting. In my days, the Danunites had everything good and plenty to eat and well-being. I have filled the storehouses of Pa'r. I have added horse to horse, shield to shield, and army to army, by virtue of Ba'l and the Gods (El). I shattered the wicked. I have removed all the evil that was in the country. I have set

up my lordly houses in good shape and I have acted
kindly toward the roots of my sovereignty.3 I have been sitting upon the throne of my father. I
have made peace with every king. Yea, every king
considered me his father because of my righteousness
and my wisdom and the kindness of my heart. I have built strongholds in all the outposts at the
borders in places where there were evil men, gang
leaders, none of whom had been subservient to the
House of Mupsh. I, Azitawadda, placed them under
neath my feet. I have built strongholds in those places,
so that the Danunites might dwell in peace of mind. I have subdued powerful countries in the west which
the kings who were before me had not been able to sub
due. I, Azitawadda, subdued them. I have brought them
(their inhabitants) down and established them at the
eastern end of my borders, and I have established Danun
ites there (in the west). In my days, there was, within
all the borders of the Plain of Adana, from the rising of
the sun to its setting, even in places which had formerly
been feared, where a man was afraid to walk on the
road but where in my days a woman was able to stroll,
peaceful activity * by virtue of Ba'l and the Gods (El).
And in all my days, the Danunites and the entire Plain
of Adana had plenty to eat and well-being and a good
situation and peace of mind. I have built this city. I have given it the name of
Azitawaddiya, for Ba'l and Reshef-^prm commissioned
me to build it. I have built it, by virtue of Ba'l and by
virtue of Reshef-^pr/w, with plenty to eat and well
being and in a good situation and in peace of mind to
be a protection for the Plain of Adana and the House of
Mupsh, for in my days, the country of the Plain of
Adana had plenty to eat and well-being, and the Danun
ites never had any night in my days. Having built this city and having given it the name
of Azitawaddiya, I have established Ba'\-KrntryI in it.
A sacrific(ial order) was established for all the molten
images: for the yearly sacrifice an ox, at the [time of
pl]owing a sheep, and at the time of harvesting a sheep. May Ba'l-Krntrys bless Azitawadda with life, peace,
and mighty power over every king, so that Ba'l-Krntryl
and all the gods of the city may give Azitawadda length
of days, a great number of years, good authority, and
mighty power over every king! And may this city
possess plenty to eat5 and wine (to drink), and may this
people that dwells in it possess oxen and small cattle and
plenty to eat and wine (to drink)! May they have many
children, may they be strong numerically, may they
serve Azitawadda and the House of Mupsh in large
numbers, by virtue of Ba'l and the Gods (El)! If there be a king among kings and a prince among
princes or a man who is (just) called a man8 who shall
wipe out the name of Azitawadda from this gate and
3 The "roots" may be the residential and capital cities of the realm, or the royal offspring. The decision would seem to lie with the Hittite text. 4 Literally: "wor\ ( A k k . dttlltt) with spindles"
5 With reference to Prov. 3:10, H. L. Ginsberg points out that lb', as contrasted with trl, has the concrete meaning of "corn." 6 That is, an ordinary human being without titles of any sort
put down his own name, even if he has good intentions
toward this city but removes this gate which was made
by Azitawadda and makes for the (new) gate a (new)
frame and puts his name upon it, whether he removes
this gate with good intentions or out of hatred and evil,
let Ba'lshamem and El-the-Creator-of-the-Earth and the
Eternal-Sun and the whole Group of the Children
of the Gods (El) wipe out that ruler and that king and
that man who is (just) called a man! However, the
name of Azitawadda shall endure forever like the name
of sun and moon!
KILAMUWA OF Y'DY-SAM'AL
This autobiographical account, composed in connection with the dedication of a palace, was discovered in 1902 in modern Zinjirli in northwest Syria. It dates from the second half of the ninth century B.C. The text consists of two parts. In the first part, king Kilamuwa boasts of his success in foreign policy, and in the second part, he praises his domestic accomplishments. He states that he improved the position of the mikpm, possibly an oppressed sedentary element of the population, on whose undisturbed relations with another group, the b'rrm, possibly referring to "wild" Bedouins, peace in his realm depended. Y'dy, whose vocalization is uncertain, might be the capital city of the realm, to be vocalized Yu'addiya or the like (cf. Azitawadda-Azitawaddiya), which later on came to be known as Sam'al. The latter, however, might have been the name of a larger region or country. For a brief bibliography, cf. F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, Early Hebrew Orthography (New Haven, 1952), p. n, fn. 2 (American Oriental Series, 36). Cf. also Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli, iv (Berlin, 1911), pp. 374-77 (Staatliche Museen tu Berlin.

I am Kilamuwa, the son of Hayya. Gabbar became
king over Y'dy but he was ineffective. There was Bmh
but he was ineffective. There was my father Hayya but
he was ineffective. There was my brother Sha'il but he
was ineffective. But I, Kilamuwa, the son of Tm,1 what
I achieved, the former (kings) did not achieve. My father's house was in the midst of mighty kings.
Everybody stretched forth his hand to eat it. But I was
in the hands of the kings like a fire that eats the beard,
like a fire that eats the hand. The king of the Danunites
(tried to) overpower me, but I hired against him the
king of Assyria, (who) gave a maid for a lamb, a man
for a garment.2 I, Kilamuwa, the son of Hayya, sat upon the throne
of my father. Before the former kings, the mlkbm went

To some I was a mother. To some I was a brother. Him

He not only hired the mighty king of Assyria, but was able to do so cheaply.

I am Barrakab, the son of Panamu, king of Sam'al,
servant of Tiglath-pileser, the lord of the (four) quar
ters of the earth.
Because of the righteousness of my father and my
own righteousness, I was seated by my Lord Rakabel
and my Lord Tiglath-pileser upon the throne of my
father. The house of my father has profited1 more than
anybody else, and I have been running at the wheel of
my Lord, the king of Assyria, in the midst of mighty
kings, possessors of silver and possessors of gold. I took
over the house of my father and made it more prosper
ous than the house of one of the mighty kings. My
brethren, the kings, are envious because of all the pros
perity of my house. My fathers, the kings of Sam'al, had no good house.
They had the house of Kilamu, which was their winter
house and also their summer house. But I have built
this house.

ZAKIR OF HAMAT AND LU'ATH
This historical inscription, dating from the early years of the eighth century B.C., was composed in connection with the dedication of a statue of Ilu-Wer, an avatar of Hadad. It was found in 1904 in a place about twenty-five miles- southwest of Aleppo which in modern times is called Afis and which appears to have been mentioned in this inscription as Apish.

A stela set up by Zakir, king of Hamat and Lu'ath,
for Ilu-Wer, [his god]. I am Zakir, king of Hamat and Lu'ath. A humble
man I am. Be'elshamayn [helped me] and stood by me.
Be'elshamayn made me king over Hatarikka (Ha
drach). Barhadad, the son of Hazael, king of Aram, united
[seven of] a group of ten kings against me: Barhadad
and his army; Bargush and his army; the king of
Cilicia and his army; the king of 'Umq and his army;
the king of Gurgum and his army; the king of Sam'al
and his army; the king of Milidh and his army. [All
these kings whom Barhadad united against me] were
seven kings and their armies. All these kings laid siege
to Hatarikka. They made a wall higher than the wall
of Hatarikka. They made a moat deeper than its moat.
But I lifted up my hand to Be'elshamayn, and Be'el
shamayn heard me. Be'elshamayn [spoke] to me
through seers and through diviners. Be'elshamayn [said
to me]: Do not fear, for I made you king, and I shall
stand by you and deliver you from all [these kings who]
set up a siege against you. [Be'elshamayn] said to me:

YEHAWMILK OF BYBLOS
This ex-voto has been known since 1869, but a fragment completing most of its lower right-hand corner was found only sixty years later. It appears to date from the fifth or fourth century. The identity of the second of the three main objects which Yehawmilk here dedicates to his goddess has not yet been fully cleared up. Instead of an engraved object, it might have been a door.

I am Yehawmilk, king of Byblos, the son of Yehar
ba'l, the grandson of Urimilk, king of Byblos, whom
the mistress, the Lady of Byblos, made king over Byblos. I have been calling my mistress, the Lady of Byblos,
[and she heard my voice]. Therefore, I have made for
my mistress, the Lady of Byblos, this altar of bronze
which is in this [courtyard], and this engraved object
of gold which is in front of this inscription1 of mine,
with the bird (winged sun ?) of gold that is set in a
(semiprecious) stone, which is upon this engraved
object of gold, and this portico with its columns and
the [capitals] which are upon them, and its roof: I,
Yehawmilk, king of Byblos, have made (these things)
for my mistress, the Lady of Byblos, as I called my
mistress, the Lady of Byblos, and she heard my voice
and treated me kindly.
May the Lady of Byblos bless and preserve Yehaw
milk, king of Byblos, and prolong his days and years
in Byblos, for he is a righteous king. And may [the
mistress,] the Lady of Byblos, give [him] favor in the
eyes of the gods and in the eyes of the people of this
country and (that he be) pleased with the people of
this country.
1 T h e text here seemingly has "engraved work of mine," but this might be a mistake of the stonecutter for a word meaning "inscription."
[Whoever you are,] ruler and (ordinary) man, who
might [continue] to do work on this altar and this
engraved wor\ of gold and this portico, my name,
Yehawmilk, king of Byblos, [you should put with]
yours upon that work, and if you do not put my name
with yours, or if you [remove] this [work and transfer
this work from its foundation] upon this place and
[ . . . , may] the mistress, the Lady of Byblos, [destroy]
that man and his seed before all the Gods of Byblos.
THE MARSEILLES TARIFF
The two blocks of stone containing this inscription were found in Marseilles in 1845. The stone used for them is known to occur in the region of Carthage. . Thus, it is possible that the document originally belonged to a temple in Carthage. However, the possibility that a similar kind of stone might also have been quarried in the neighborhood of Marseilles apparently has not yet been sufficiently explored. The date of the inscription is uncertain; it may date from the third century or the early part of the second century B.C. The text is carefully engraved. It is provided with a tide, and each paragraph begins with a new line. Bibliography: CIS, 1, no. 165, pi. xxxvii; M.

THE CARTHAGE TARIFF
A number of fragments very similar in contents to the preceding Marseilles Tariff have also been found in Carthage itself over a number of years beginning with 1858. Three of those fragments, though not parts of the same monument, were recognized by J.-B. Chabot as belonging to identical texts, and Chabot's reconstruction has been followed in this translation. The date of the Carthage Tariff is about the same as that of the Marseilles Tariff. Bibliography: CIS, 1, no. 167, pi. xxxvii; M.

PUNIC EX-VOTO INSCRIPTIONS
The first two of these stelas were discovered at Salamnibo between 1945 and 1950 and published by J.-G. F^vrier in CIS, 1, Nos. 5684 and 5685, Pis. x c v m and xcix. They appear to belong among the oldest Punic inscriptions known so fair, possibly dating from about as early as 600 B.C. The other two stelas, dating from a considerably later period, were found at El-Hofra in Constantine in 1950 and published by A. Berthier and R. Charlier, Le Sanctuaire punique d'El-Hofra (Paris, 1955), Nos. 28 and 55, pp. 29-31, 49-51, Pis. 11 A and vn A. All of diem belong to a type of monument that over the last century and a half has become known in hundreds of specimens, most of them inscribed with basically identical inscriptions. A few of the texts contain the word ml\ which has been recognized as a cultic term denoting some kind of sacrifice. Ml\ appears at times modified by such words as 'mr, "lamb," 'dm, "man" ( ? ) , or b'l ("Ba'al," or "citizen," or, rather unlikely, "instead of an infant"). Occasionally, one also finds other cultic expressions added, such as bshrm btm, of which the first, crucial element is most obscure and has again been thought to refer to human (infant) sacrifices. Whatever their precise significance, the relevance of these monuments and the inscriptions they bear to Canaanite cult practices characterized by the OT terms molech (moloch) and topheth seems quite well established and has been discussed extensively, cf. the following additional bibliography: J.-G. Fevrier, JA, CCXLIII (1955), pp. 52-55; id., J A, CCXLVIII (i960), pp. 167-87; id., R£], N S , iv, 3 (cxxiv) (1964), pp. 7-18; Donner-Rollig, No. 61 (1, p. 14,11, pp. 76-78); G.

Incantations
THE AMULET FROM ARSLAN TASH
The limestone plaque containing this inscription was purchased in 1933 at Arslan Tash, the ancient Hadattu. At the time, two such plaques were obtained but only one has been published so far. The language of the inscription is an undetermined Canaanite dialect; the writing is of an Aramaic type. It would seem to date from the seventh century B.C. According to the interpretation presented below, we have here the text of an incantation named after a certain Ssm, possibly a mythological being of Anatolian (or Egyptian?) provenance but not a fullfledged god such as is pictured on the reverse of the plaque. The incantation is directed against the winged sphinx and the she-wolf devouring a human being, both pictured on the obverse and collectively called the "stranglers," that is, female demons supposed to cause the death of infants and children. It may have been intended to facilitate childbirth and to make sure that the newborn infant would not fall prey to the "stranglers." However, the reading of the crucial passage at the end which is often translated: "May her womb be opened and may she give birth! . . . When the sun rises, travail and give birth!," is
based upon the doubtful reconstruction of missing words and upon an uncertain and, it seems, unwarranted emendation of what is actually written.

THE URUK INCANTATION
A tablet inscribed with cuneiform characters originating from Uruk (Erech) was acquired by the Louvre in 1913. Already its first editor, F. Thureau-Dangin, tentatively determined its language as Aramaic. The date of the tablet is uncertain. It may possibly come from the third century B.C. Bibliography: F.

Political Documents
THE TREATY BETWEEN KTK AND ARPAD
The inscriptions containing this treaty originate from a locality called Sujin near Sfire, or, as seems more likely, from the village of Sfire itself, about sixteen miles southeast of Aleppo. The block of basalt on which the portion of the treaty designated Sfire I is inscribed was broken horizontally into two parts, with the loss of a few lines in between. In addition to the text inscribed upon the front and the back of the block (designated I A and I B, although it is by no means clear which is the recto and which is the verso), one side of it is also inscribed (Sfire I C ) . Another version is preserved in a very fragmentary fashion (Sfire II). It is similarly inscribed upon a stela reconstituted from a number of preserved fragments. Another portion of the treaty (Sfire III) has been recovered from nine fragments of a stela. In this case, only one inscribed side, apparendy the verso, is preserved.
T h e treaty dates from about 750 B.C. T h e identity of Kt\ has not yet been established. Ktf^ has been vocalized Katikka ( A l t ) , and it has been identified with Kas/shku or Urartu (DupontSommer) , Hatarikka-Hadrach (Landsberger), Assyria (Dossin), and a locality named Kis(s)ik (Noth). Cf. also R. Degen, Die Welt des Orients, iv (1967), pp. 48-60.
T h e inscriptions became known to scholars in 1930, but no usable photographs or first hand studies of the originals were published until 1956-58.

(Sfire I A)
A treaty of Barga'yah, king of Kt\, with Matti'el, the
son of 'Attarsamak, king of [Arpad; a t]reaty of the
sons of Barga'yah with the sons of Matti'el; a treaty of
the sons of the sons [and the offspring] of Barga'yah

king of Arpad; a treaty of Kt\ with [a treaty of]
Arpad; a treaty of the inhabitants of Kt\ with a treaty

with all Aram and with Musr and with his (Mattel's)
sons who will come up after him, and [. . .j all upper

this treaty. 1 This treaty concluded by Barga'fyah is set up before

before Nergal and Las, before Shamash and Nur, before
S[in and Nikkal, be]fore Nikkar and Kd'h, before all
the Gods of Rhbh and 'dm, [before . . . Hadad of A]
leppo, before Sibitti, before El and 'Elyon, before
Heaven [and Earth, before A]byss and Sources, and
before Day and Night. Witnesses all [you] G[ods be
for it]! Open your eyes to behold the treaty of Barga'yah
[with Matti'el, \ing of Arpad]!
If Matti'el, the son of 'Attarsamak, kin[g of Arpad,]
is false to [the Gods of this treaty, and i]f the offspring
of Matti'el is false [to . . . (large break) . . . . Seven

His seven daughters shall go in search of food, and
they shall not arouse concern.
If Matti'el is false [to Barga'yah and to] his son and
to his offspring, his kingdom shall be a kingdom of
sand, (nay) a kingdom (like) a dream that fades like
fire. [May Ha]dad [pour out] everything evil on earth

and the bow of his nobles. As a man of wax is blinded, thus Matti'el shall be blinded.
[As] this calf is cut up, thus Matti'el and his nobles
shall be cut up.

In Sfire II A 9, lions seem to be mentioned in the same context, offering a good parallel to panther. But here, among reptiles and insects, bears and panthers are strangely out of place. 7 Qqbtn may be an adjective ending in -tn, from the root (Arabic) q4b, (Hebrew) qsb/p. 8 These seem to be twelve dependencies of Arpad. 8 That is, his life and property, unless the meaning is: "during his own lifetime and that of his posterity."

AHIRAM OF BYBLOS
This inscription, found in 1923, is the oldest of the documents translated here and is now quite generally dated in the early tenth century B.C.

In the month of Bui, in the year fourteen—14—of the
reign of Eshmun'azar, king of Sidon, the son of king
Tabnit, king of Sidon, king Eshmun'azar, king of
Sidon, spoke as follows: I have been snatched away before my time, the son
of a number of restricted days, an orphan, the son of a
widow. I am lying in this casket and this grave, in a
place which I (myself) built. Whoever you are, ruler and (ordinary) man, may he
not open this resting-place and may he not search in it
for anything, for nothing whatever has been placed into
it! May he not take the casket in which I am resting,
and may he not carry me away from this resting-place
to another resting-place! Even if people goad you, do
not listen to their talk, for any ruler and any man who
shall open this resting-place or who shall take up the casket in which I am resting or who shall carry me away from this resting-place—may they not have a resting-place with the shades, may they not be buried in a grave, and may they not have son and seed to take their place! And may the Holy Gods abandon them to a mighty ruler who (might) rule them, in order to cut down that ruler or man who shall open this restingplace or who shall take up this casket, as well as the seed of that ruler or those men! May they have no root down below and no fruit up on top, and may they be cursed1 among the living under the sun, for I am to be pitied,2 I was snatched away before my time, the son of a number of restricted days, an orphan, the son of a widow, I am. For I, Eshmun'azar, king of Sidon, the son of king Tabnit, king of Sidon, the grandson of king Eshmun'azar, king of Sidon, and my mother, Amo'ashtart, priestess of Astarte, our mistress the queen, the daughter of king Eshmun'azar, king of Sidon, (we are) the ones who built the houses of the gods, the house of [Astarte] in Sidon-by-the-Sea, and we (also) established Astarte in Shamem-Addirim.3 We are the ones who built a house for Eshmun, the Holy Prince, (at) the YdU Spring in the mountain, and we established him in Shamem-Addirim. We are the ones who built houses for the gods of Sidon in Sidon-by-the-Sea, a house for the Lord of Sidon and a house for 'AshtartShem-Ba'l. Furthermore, the Lord of Kings4 gave us Dor and Joppa, the mighty lands of Dagon, which are in the Plain of Sharon, in accordance with the important deeds which I did. And we added them to the borders of the country, so that they would belong to Sidon forever.
Whoever you are, ruler and (ordinary) man, may he not open it and may he not uncover me and may he not carry me away from this resting-place and may he not take up the casket in which I am resting, lest these Holy Gods abandon them and cut down that ruler and those men and their seed forever!
1 Or perhaps: "may they not have any stately appearance." 2 Nhn may actually belong in the beginning o£ the next paragraph and reflect an attempt to start that paragraph as follows: "For we, I . . . ." The remainder of this paragraph is out of place here. 3 For these sections of Byblos, cf. O. Eissfeldt, Ras Schamra und Sanchunjaton (Halle, 1939), pp. 62-67, 109-27 (Beiträge zur Religionsgeschichte des Altertums, 4).
4 In related Phoenician inscriptions, this tide refers to the Ptolemaic ruler, but it occurs already in a seventh-century Aramaic papyrus from Egypt and there refers to the king of Egypt. Here, it would seem to refer to the Achaemenid king.

South-Arabian Inscriptions
TRANSLATOR: A. JAMME
The historical period of South Arabia begins, according to common opinion,1· with the eighth century B.C., and is definitively closed by the Moslem occupation in the first half of the seventh century A.D. Its inscriptions are chiefly in the dialects spoken in the four great kingdoms of Saba', Ma'in, Qatabän, and I^adramawt. Exclusively historical texts have been excluded from this collection; they require a long commentary, for many important historical facts are still uncertain. In addition, SouthArabic studies are still in the period of decipherment; consequendy the translations must be accompanied by critical remarks and explanations. For all the South-Arabian divinities, see my paper Le pantheon sud-arabe preislamique d'apres les sources epigraphiques, in he Museon, LX (1947), pp. 57-147.

This formula, indicating that the divinity (7 and lym) was taken as witness to a pact of confederation, does not prove that the organization of the Sabaean community was a theocracy (N. Rhodokanakis, Studien, 11, p. I I , followed by A. F. L. Beeston, Problems, p. 46, note 2). On the other hand, this formula introduced by hwft "he established" points out an important development in Sabaean history with regard to the confederation of the tribes, but is not necessarily connected with the foundation of a dynasty (A. F. L. Beeston, Problems, p. 46); cf. CIH 367 and RtS 2831/2 (no. 8 of the present collection). ab'ffr: b has the same meaning as instrumental Arabic bi (M.

There is perhaps a survival from an older stage of the religion, in which 'ttr was venerated as the first god.

Rhodokanakis, p. 212) because of the substantive mbny in 11. 4 and 5. 6 qyf: the exterior aspect of the monument does not allow the translation of qyf either as "stebnaltar" (M. Hofner-N. Rhodokanakis, pp. 212-13) or as "incense altar" ( R t S , vi, p. 144); this qyf is not an altar. M. Hofner and N. Rhodokanakis (p. 216, note 1) admit the existence of the root *qu/f (may better be *qyf). The root wqf "to stand (upright)" is attested by Landberg {Glossaire datinois, HI, Leiden, 1942, p. 2934, and Hadramout, Leiden, 1901, p. 17, note 1); it seems better to adopt the preceding meaning for South-Arabian q(y)f, which can hardly be translated as "cult stone" (A. F. L. Beeston, Sabaean inscriptions, Oxford, 1937, p. 83). 1 sm'·. name of the lunar god honored as the god " w h o listens to," that is to say "who hearkens to." tgtfhmyn: name of the sun-goddess characterized as "she who darts forth her rays."

the star-god 'Agar. For k?w, cf. N. Rhodokanakis^ (WZKM, XXVIII, 1 9 1 4 , p. 112) who rightly translates it "pits." A. F. L. Beeston's interpretation of this text with regard to the sacred meaning of the hunting game is possible.

5. A large number of Sabaean texts are dedicatory inscriptions. The present text from Mareb tells of the offering of a bronze statue; it probably mentions the judicial clearing of a man who was falsely considered as a member of a conspiracy, although he had resisted the propaganda made by 'Awsum. This text also mentions the punishment of a girl ordered by the divinity. University Museum (Pennsylvania) 30-47-96 = photograph published by L.

6. The public confession was known among the South-Arabian peoples.1 The present text in relief on a bronze tablet from Medinet Haram2 mentions five transgressions, all of which concern ritual sexual purity.

Ryckmans, La confession publique des peches en Arable Meridionale preislamique, in Le Museon, LVIII (1945), pp. 1-14 passim.

3 Although the Sabaean god dsmwy was important, we still do not know his characteristics. * hrmw. the personal pronoun [k]w can refer to the woman as well as to Harim. 5 bh' "he came into (the temple)" (cf. G. Ryckmans, p. 9) or "(the temple or the house of somebody else)" (cf. CIH, n, p. 238 B): these details are outside the text. 6 The interpretation of 1. 5 B + 6 A is determined by the whole text, the meaning of which is sexual. It is thus irrelevant to allude to the possibility that this passage could refer to the obligation of changing or washing the clothes before coming in touch with the divinity (cf. G. Ryckmans, p. 9, note 24); the text does not speak either of a temple or a prayer. 7 F. Hommel, followed by G. Ryckmans (p. 130), translated yhln<yM'n "to pay the fine"; this opinion is conjectural. sly£wbn "that [the god] may reward [him]" (cf. N. Rhodokanakis).

'aqtawa and translates it "military officer" (in Anzeiger der Academic der WissenscAaften in Wien, n - 2 2 [1938], p. 74 and note 3). The idea of a military function certainly is secondary and does not fit in the texts (G. J. Botterweck, Altsiidarabische Glaser-Inschriften, in Orientalia, xix, 1950,
PP- 437-38, no. 6/1 = A 788/1, and K. Y. Nam!, Nair nuqus samiyyat

9. In a depression called el-Mihyar approximately twenty minutes from the ancient capital M a i n , J. Halevy found a stela, the four sides of which are covered with inscriptions, and only copied a part of them.1 On the basis of E. Glaser's squeezes of the stela and several inscribed fragments, K. Mlaker published Die Hierodulenlisten (pp. 1-72).* These texts are written according to an almost identical formula mentioning the appointment of women to the temple.3 The countries or the cities from which these women came are always indicated; from South-Arabia: the countries of 'Awsan (Glaser 1286), Qatabän (Glaser 1266) and Hadramawt (Glaser 1253); the cities of Yatrib (ylrb: Medina; Glaser 1288); from northern countries and cities: Misr (msr: Egypt; Glaser 1272 = RßS 3445 bis, no. 354), Dedan (ddn5': El-'Ela; Halevy 233/6-9 = R£S 2773/1), Jawanum (jwnm: probably Greece; Glaser 1247), Moab (m b; Glaser 1256), Lihyän, Gaza and Sidon. These texts allow us to make several hypotheses either about the exact acts of the men with regard to the women mentioned, or about the fate or the activities of these women inside the temple8; the latter may be presented, e.g. as maids of any kind, hierodules, recluses, and so on.

1 lw': H. Grimme (Der südarabische Levitismus und sein Verhältnis zum Levitismus in Israel, in Le Museon, xxxvn, 1924, pp. 181-82) translates "pledge, loan," contrary to "priest" of J. H. Mordtmann (Beiträge zur minäischen Epigraphik., Weimar, 1897, pp. 42-43) and "Levite" of A.
Jaussen-R. Savignac (Mission archeologique en Arabic, 11: El-'Ela, d'HSgra
ä Teima, Harr ah de Tebou\, Paris, 1914, pp. 257-58, note 1). But K. Mlaker (Die Hierodulenlisten, pp. 57-58) rejects H. Grimme's view on the value of purification attributed to this pledge. 2 s'qs: J. H. Mordtmann's restoration of ys before fqs is conjectural; cf. Arabic stfaqa "to strike somebody (thunder)"; here in the meaning of "to reduce, subject." 3 A. Jaussen-R. Savignac's translation of the three preceding words m.mrm/'n/bm'tq "offering a gift he presents himself as a freed man" does not seem to be satisfactory.

7 s\rb\whsr·. K. Mlaker's argumentation (pp. 29-31) seems to be based on the opinion that these women really were hierodules. For s\rb\ the primitive meaning of \rb is "to tighten, bind" (Landberg, Glossaire, in, p. 2563); according to die particular value of the fourth form, skfb may be translated "to appoint." For £sr, the points mentioned in K. Mlaker's argument allow us to render this verb, which I consider as a sccond form, in "to seclude."

Rhodokanakis (p. 67) relates to Ethiopic sare' "to regulate, arrange, ordain." 18 b i t "in what" = "of what"; neither N.

The preceding restoration is superfluous. 17 rnhd, the subject of which is 'Abyada' Yaja' and the council of Ma'in, indicates the juridical, rather than the political (N. Rhodokanakis, p. 67) transfer of the administration of the land. 18 bh': N. Rhodokanakis (p. 37) relates it to Hebrew ba' (root: bw'). 19 'rds "its breadth"; cf. Arabic 'arid "wide, broad"; by opposition, the first measurement indicates the height of the building. 20 The two preceding measures give the part of the construction mentioned in line 1 as built with the income from the factory (N. Rhodokanakis, p. 68). 2 1 7 b w , cf. Syriac sbo' "to leave, leave over, leave by will"; this word means the contribution granted by the Minaean state and specified by dr' "cereal"; N. Rhodokanakis (p. 69) thinks that ibw means the supply for the workers (indirectly true) and imposed on the country (which does not seem to be exact). 22 The number refers to the quantity of Ibw. 23 zbr is a unit of capacity the exact value of which is still unknown; notice that the post-biblical Hebrew fibrdr means "to measure the length from shoulder to belly" (M. Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, p. 519 B), and that the measure of the height of the building is exactly the same as that of zbr. 24 b'wiphs: the singular pronoun s refers to 'rd of line 3 and not to the buildings mentioned in line 1 which would require the plural xm; in addition, the site of these latter is described at the beginning of line 2; the end of line 4 and the beginning of line 5 mention grounds, a water conduit and an irrigation canal which were evidently located outside the city itself. 25 fs', a weir dividing the water into two directions (N.

Albright, The Chronology of Ancient South Arabia, p. 8, and H. von Wissmann-M. Höfner, Beiträge, pp. 43 ff. and 71-72. 2 The Qatabanian people is often called (kll)wldl'm "(all) the children of ' A m m " (cf. e.g. no. 14/2-3), so it is not surprising to see the Qatabanian mukarrib Sahar Hiläl presenting himself as \br "the first-born" of the same moon divinity mentioned under two different names (the singular pronoun d relates to the two proper names). 3 'mr and smr are names of temples, according to the unpublished texts Jamme 868-72. * tntm: this epithet is still unexplained. 5 ihr is according to M. Höfner-N. Rhodokanakis (Zur Interpretation, HI, in WZKM, xLiii [1936], p. 216, followed by G. Ryckmans, Les religions arabes preist antiques, 2nd ed., Louvain, 1951, p. 30), the priest who goes around the altar. 6 rby, pi. 'rby, is an administrator of the estates belonging to a temple, and not necessarily a "priest administrator" (G. Ryckmans, Les religions, p. 30). The expression Ihr/wrby means that Sahar was at the same time priest of the temple of 'Amm Ray'än, and administrator of the estates of this sanctuary. 7 lt\, cf. Syriac letk_, a dry measure (J. Payne Smith, Syriac Dictionary, p. 245 B) and post-biblical Hebrew lete\, a dry measure and also a land measure (M. Jastrow, A Dictionary, p. 720 B ) ; here a verb (N. Rhodokanakis, p. 43, note 3) with the meaning "to measure." %b'm: N. Rhodokanakis (p. 43) equals b'm to Hebrew me'im "from." 9 'dfrm; according to Landberg (Hadramoüt, pp. 312-13). N. Rhodokanakis considers this word as the proper name of the place. The importance of the wells, and especially of such well-built wells, explains why the mukflrrib kept control of them. 10gib: the reading of the first two letters is uncertain. N. Rhodokanakis (p. 40) translates it "unexpected attack (? famine ?)." Because qnyhw "his possession" also includes the buildings, the meaning "famine?" is excluded as well as that of "unfruitful year"; cf. Arabic gulbah "calamity, misfortune."

1 Cf. A. S. Tritton (Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, x (1940), pp. 514-15), who is also inclined to exclude the idea of sacrifice, which later on is proposed by A. F. L. Beeston (The Ritual Hunt, p. 191). The preceding hypothesis is not required for the interpretation of the text.
2 W. F. Albright ( T h e Chronology of the Ancient South Arabia, p. n and note 30): probably in the second century A.D.; cf. also H. von Wissmann-M. Höfner (Beiträge, pp. 105, 107 and 1 1 5 ) : after A.D. 200. 3 sqlb/whrr and drs: A. F. L. Beeston: "founded and colonized" and "built in stone"; but M. Höfner in'H. von Wissmann-M. Hofner (Beiträge, p. 115): "destroyed and overthrew'' and "damaged." Yada"ab Bayyin of the present text cannot be the founder of Sabwa, for the city had existed a long time before this king and the existence of both the fortress and the temple is attested in line 2. On the other hand, it would rather be a strange policy for the founder of a new dynasty to engrave an inscription recalling that he himself destroyed and overthrew his capital and damaged its temple. I suggest to interpret sqlb (cf. qlb in Arabic "to turn (up), change" and in Soqotri "to turn" ( W . Leslau, Lexique soqotri, p. 374) and hrr, second form, cf. Arabic hrr "to fall down") as alluding to the complete and profound transformation of the city, which the king Yada"ab Bayyin had performed. This transformation was needed as it is indicated by the falling in of both the fortress and the temple.
*sqr/sll: A. F. L. Beeston's translation "roofed with stone" is certainly possible, cf., e.g. R&S 2789/2 (Minaean) which contradicts RiS remark (vn, p. 417) with regard to the necessity of m or n after /11. This remark however is opposed to M. Hofner's interpretation of sll in "the pavings, the stone facings ( ? ) . " R&S suggests another possibility; sqr/fll may be considered as two verbs asyndetically united: "he roofed and paved." 5 According to RßS interpretation. 6 The conjunction mt "when" introduces the two verbs.

J. Drewes in Bibliotheca Orientalis, xi [1954] pp. 93-94 and pi. m) cf. my paper, L'inscription hairamoutique Ingrams t et hi chasse rituclle sud-arabe, in Le Musion, L X I X (1956), pp. 99-100.
4 hlqb·. A. F. L. Beeston hesitatingly translates "to assume his tide" (Appendix, pp. 442-43); according to J. Ryckmans, this verb must be rendered in "to give [the king] the cognomen, the epithet" (L'institution, pp. 328-29). The latter opinion is excluded by the fact that both hmtll and hlqb have the same subject, the king. Iqb designates the grant of coronation honors; cf. Arabic Iqb nnd form "to entide" (R. Dozy, Supplement aux dictionnaires arabes, 11, p. 542).
23. A fragmentary inscribed clay stamp unearthed at Beitin, biblical Bethel, in 1957, by James L. Kelso; 7 x 8 cm. and 1.5 cm. thick; almost identical with, but different from the one seen by Th. Bent at al-MaShad (about 62 km. in a straight line southeast of Sibam, in Hatframawt) and whose paper squeeze, A 727, belongs to the Glaser collection. The inscription, identical in the two stamps, although slighdy different from a palaeographic viewpoint, is the seal of a Hadrami fdn "delegate" living at Bethel and whose function was to authenticate with his seal, shipments of goods sent back to Hadramawt. Cf. G. W. Van Beek and A. Jamme, An Inscribed South Arabian Clay Stamp from Bethel, in BASOR, No. 151, October, 1958, pp. 9-16 and 4 illustrations, and A. Jamme and G. W.

24. A Qatabanian rock inscription discovered by Major M. D. Van Lessen in the Soames Hill near the Yemeni border in the vicinity of Mukeras, with the name of a previously unknown name of a god, whose scriptio plena, 'lyn, may be graphically compared with the divine epitheton in the Old Testament, 'elydn ('lywn; e.g., Dt 32:8). Jamme 889; A. Jamme, Inscription rupestre et graffites qatabanites photographies par le Major M. D. Van Lessen, in RSO, xxxvn (1962), pp. 231-33 and tracing on p. 232.

Addenda
Corrections and additions to the translations and notes of the second edition have been made at the appropriate places in the third edition wherever these changes fitted into the existing arrangement of lines and pages. However some important alterations would not fit into the text. They are given here with a reference to the quarter of the page on which they are to be read. An asterisk in the text or notes will alert the reader of the third edition to additional material in the Addenda. The
Addenda has been included in the Supplement to the Ancient Near East in Texts and Pictures with
the hope that in most instances the user may see, even without the asterisks, the line within the quarter of the page to which the additional material is relevant. Each column of the page is divided into two halves: the first column of the page into a and b\ the second column, into c and d.

Posener, Literature et politique dans l'Ügyptc de la Xlle dynastie (Paris, 1956), 87-115, where it is argued that a genuine tomb autobiography may have been expanded to form a piece of propaganda for the ruling king.

99c. As will be pointed out in the notes to Atrahasis this text is an integral part of that epic and is one of the earliest portions of the tale. It belongs to the first tablet of both the Old Babylonian and Assyrian versions. Our understanding of the content of the Old Babylonian version has been considerably improved by the recent study of W. von Soden, Orientalia NS, xxvi (1957), 306-15 which has necessitated a change in almost every line of the translation.

For a bibliography of all important studies on these texts down to about i960, see the bibliographies preceding the transliterations of Nos. 1-19 in Andree Herdner, Corpus des tablettes en cuniiformes alphabetiques decouvertes a Ras Shamra-Ugarit de 1929 й 1939 (texte), 1963. Herdner's No. 13 is not included in pp. 129-55, an<^ her Nos. 3 and 4 figure there in the reverse order. Each of Herdner's bibliographies is followed by an important new, annotated transliteration of the tablet in question. In the original Ugaritic script, the texts are published in the accompanying volume of the Corpus, which bears the same tide as the other except that the parentheses at the end contain the words "figures et planches" instead of the word "texte." The figures are identical with the autographs which accompanied the editiones principes and have not been corrected in the light of observations contained in the volume of "texte!' The planches are photographic plates, on which the writing is probably as legible as it could be made.

It is good to go upon the way of god.
Great things happen to him who puts it in his heart.
It is the monument upon earth of him who puts his way
into his heart.
He who is on the way of god,
He fulfills his span of life in joy of heart,
Richer than any peer of his.
He grows old in his own town;
He is in honor with his nome;
All of his body grows young as a child;
His many children before him are nobles of the villages,
Son following upon son. His countenance appears like the sun-disk, when it presents itself.
Awe of him is in the hearts of men,
Love of him in the hearts of women.
He reaches the necropolis in joy of heart,
With a good embalmment of the work of Anubis,
While the children of his children are in his place.
When he has passed from life,
Those in his town say of him:
"He was a follower of the Foremost of the
Westerners1
In whom god found no fault."2

Williams argues that it is no skeptical denial of after-life, but rather a protest against "cosdy and elaborate preparations for the preservation of the body after death."

407b, n. 27. In the soul's final speech, Faulkner, opxit., 30, translates the first sentence with "complaint," rather than "mourning." Williams, opxit., 56, renders the following sentences: "You must make offering on the brazier, (or) cling to life, as you say. Desire that I (remain) here after you have rejected the West, or desire, rather, that you reach the West, your body be buried in the earth, and I alight after you have died.

T h e peasant offers to buy back a confiscated donkey for the cost of the damaged grain.
408b. W . K . Simpson, JAOS, LXXVIII (1958), 50-51, points out an allusion to this story on a Rameseside ostracon: "I am killed, my donkeys are seized, and (even) the complaint is taken from my mouth!"
410b, n. 29. Lefebvre, opxit., 68, translates: " T h e complainant becomes a sufferer, and the sufferer will be a petitioner: (his) enemy is (his) murderer." All the peasant gained from his complaint was the prospect of being killed; he might as well appeal to Anubis.
412b. T h e text has been restudied by Z. 2aba, Les Maximes de Ptahhotep (Prague, 1956). J. Spiegel, Das Werden der altägyptischen Hochkultur (Heidelberg, 1953), 455-91, feels that the difference between Ptah-hotep and most of the later instructions is that this document was directed toward a candidate for high office, rather than a relatively humble man. R. A. Caminos, Literary Fragments in the Hieratic Script (Oxford, 1956), Pis. 28-30, offers tattered additions to British Museum 10509.
4i2d, n. 8. G. Fecht, Der Habgierige und die Maat in der Lehre des Ptahhotep (Glückstadt und Hamburg, 1958), 11-34, has an extended discussion of this maxim. For his translation he sees a parallel with the Instruction for K i n g Meri-ka-Re, 54-56 (p. 415 below).
414b, n. 28. Spiegel, opxit., 348-49, treats this section in terms of the ancient psychology of education.

ADDENDA
4i4<L A Volten, Zwei altagyptische politische Schrijten (Kopenhagen, 1945), publishes the Papyrus Carlsberg VI. Caminos, op.cit., Pis. 26-27, publishes additions to Papyrus Moscow 4658. G. Posener, Literature et politique (Paris, 1956), 16, points out that "a talker is a troublemaker" in II. 23 and 27 is a rejection of the encouragement to protest in the Peasant, the Prophecy of Neferti, and the Admonitions of Ipu-wer; it leans toward the loyalist advice of the Middle Kingdom.
415b, n. 1. W. C. Hayes, The Middle Kingdom in Egypt {Cambridge Ancient History, rev. ed.; Cambridge, 1961), 5 and back cover, makes Wah-ka-Re Kheti III, rather than II; makes Wah-ankh Intef II, rather than I, and dates the latter to 21172069 B.C.
415c. This section and the following translated by T. W. Thacker in Documents from Old Testament Times, ed. by D. W. Thomas (London, 1958), 155-61. For a parallel to 11. 54-56, see the new note on p. 412 above.
417a. The word translated "dyke" may be the name of the XXIInd nome of Upper Egypt—C. F. Nims, Archiv Orientdlni,
xx (1952), 343-46—perhaps: "APHRODITOPOLIS HAS BEEN TAKEN
. . . it."
418b. R. Anthes, JNES, xvi (1957), 176-91; XVII (1958), 208-09, argues that the Instruction was composed by Amenem-het, still living, when Sen-Usert was being installed as coregent. G. Posener, opxit., 61-86, suggests that the text was a piece of political writing by the scribe Khety, commissioned on behalf of the new dynasty.
4i8d, n. 3. Anthes, opxit., 182: "He spoke in determining right for his son."
419a. Anthes' translation {opxit., 189) runs: "I awoke at some fighting and I was in control of my limbs. I found that it was a hand-to-hand conflict of the soldiers. Acting quickly I had the weapons in my(?) hand. I made the cowards retreat (and they disappeared?)." This accords with Anthes' belief that the attack was not fatal.
4i9d. Additional ostraca are now known: G. Posener, Revue d'Egyptologie, ix (1952), 109-17; J. Cerny and A. H. Gardiner, Hieratic Ostraca, 1 (Oxford, 1957), PI. iv, 3 and 5.
4i9d. The new ostraca permit a sounder translation:
[He] said: "Keep yourself clean in your own view;
guard against anybody else keeping you clean. If you
are a man of standing, you should found your own
household. Take to yourself a wife, a lady of heart, and
a male child will be born to you. "You should build your own house for your son,
whereas (I) made for you the place where you are.
Embellish your house of the necropolis, and enrich your
place of the West. Accept, for death is debasing for us;
accept, for life is exalting for us. The house of death is
(destined) for life. "Seek out for yourself an extension of inundated
land. . . . "
420b. This section has been translated by Sir Alan Gardiner in JEA, XLV (1959), 12-15: Man is advised to secure written evidence of his first offerings to the god. Sir Alan rendered the end: "The god does it to magnify his name, but man it is who
is inebriated." God rejoices in festivity and prostrations, whereas man has the chance to indulge in heavy drinking.
421c. In JEA, XLVII (1961), 100-06, R. J. Williams argues for the priority of the Egyptian text, and suggests a late New Kingdom date for the origin of the Instruction. W. K. Simpson summarizes the text in Adolf Erman, The Ancient Egyptians. A Sourcebook of their Writings (Harper Torchbooks, 1966), xii-xiv. Some portions translated by J. M. Plumley in Documents from Old Testament Times, ed. by D. W. Thomas (London, 1958), 172-86.
424a. In ZAeS, xc (1963), 98-102, G. Posener argues for the translation: "Do not falsify the oracle on the papyrus." He points to the publication by I.E.S. Edwards, Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. Fourth Series. Oracular Amuletic Decrees of the Late New Kingdom, 2 vols. (London, i960).
425a. G. Posener, Revue d'Egyptologie, vi (1951), 27-48, lists several more instructions, many of them fragmentary or present only in allusion. The text on an ostracon of early Nineteenth Dynasty date has more than 15 lines of advice similar to that in the Instruction of Amen-em-Opet:—A. H. Gardiner, WZKM, LIV (1957), 43-45· In JEA, XLVIII (1962), 25-35, H. Goedicke published a stela of an overseer of priests, Mentu-hotep son of Hapi, of the Middle Kingdom, with moralizing phrases. Goedicke's translation, "My instruction to my children (is) as follows," was criticized by W. Schenkel in JEA, L (1964), 6-12, who translated, "(I am) an instructor of children in . . . speaking," and then took the ensuing "advice" as epithets of Mentu-hotep. There are still nuggets of advice: "Incline your heart. Do not be prejudiced against a petitioner until he has said what he came for.. . . The good character of a man is more to him than a thousand gifts in acts. The testimony of men lies in that statement in the mouth of commoners: 'A man's monument is his goodness. The wicked of character is a forgotten man.'" Late books of wisdom in demotic are: A. Volten, Kopenhagener Texte zum demotischen Weisheitsbuch (Kopenhagen, 1940); Das demotische Weisheitsbuch (Kopenhagen, 1941), including Papyrus Insinger in translation; and S.R.K. Glanville, Catalogue of the Demotic Papyri in the British Museum. II. The Instructions of Onchsheshonqy (London, 1955). Glanville remarks that the demotic wisdom book is closely related in tone to the Instruction of Ani (pp. 420-21 here).
427d. Additional bibliography: P. Grelot, RB, LXVIII (1961), 178-94.
431a. G. Posener, Litterature et politique (Paris, 1956), 11727, lists two papyri, a writing tablet, and about 20 ostraca, in addition to this stela. He characterizes the text as a "loyalist instruction," which, along with other documents, urged fidelity to the Twelfth Dynasty kings. H. Grapow, ZAeS, LXXIX (1954), 21-27, analyzes the verse style of the poem.
43 id. Translated by W. K. Simpson, in A. Erman, The Ancient Egyptians (Harper Torchbooks, 1966), xvi-xvii. On the importance of the author Khety (iii 6 of this text), see Posener, opxit., 4-7.
432c. We now credit the author Khety with other compositions. See Posener, opxit., passim.
432d, n. 2. The Kemit or "Conclusion" or similar has now been identified as a Middle Kingdom practice manual for pro

spective government clerks—G. Posener, in B. van de Walle, La Transmission des textes littiraires egyptiens (Bruxelles, 1948), 41-50; Literature et politique, 4-5.
441b. A new translation by R. O. Faulkner in JEA, LI (1965), 53-62, with his commentary in JEA, L (1964), 24-36.
441b. For an argument that the document applies to the situation in the late Thirteenth Dynasty, see J. Van Seters, JEA, L (1964), 12-23.
444b. The ostraca now number about 20. Translation by G. Lefebvre, Romans et contes egyptiens (Paris, 1949), 91-105. G. Posener, Utterature et politique (Paris, 1956), 145-57, deals with several sections of the text; in 21-60, he emphasizes its importance as propaganda for Amen-em-het I. See also G. Lanczkowski, Altagyptischer Prophetismus (Wiesbaden, i960).
445b. Posener, op.cit., 151, suggests that the attack by foreigners has crowded the fortresses where Egyptians might seek asylum, so that new refugees meet deaf ears.
445c. Posener, opxit., 151-52, translates: "One bursts into laughter at illness; one will not weep because of death. One will not spend the night fasting because of death, the heart of man being absorbed in himself."
445d. Posener, opxit., 157, translates in the sense: "Thus it is that a king will reveal himself to the south." He does not believe that the text necessitates a southern origin for Amen-em-het.
448c. Another example of a similar oracle given by C. F. Nims, JNES, vii (1948), 156-62.
467a. E. F. Wente, JNES, xxi (1962), 118-28, offers a commentary on harpers' songs shown in the tombs.
467d. There is comprehensive coverage by S. Schott, Altagyptische Liebeslieder (Zurich, 1950). Four of the songs below
are also translated by J. M. Plumley in Documents from Old Testament Times, ed. by D. W. Thomas (London, 1958), 187-91.
469c. In WZKM, LIV (1957), 46-50, H. Goedicke translates the text simply as a call to the herd: "When the herdsman is in the water among the fish, he keeps talking with the shad and greets the oxyrhynchus fish: 'O our herdsman, O westerner(?), the herdsman of the west!' "
470c. Translated also by R. A. Caminos, Late-Egyptian Miscellanies (Oxford, 1954), 37-40; 153-55.
47od, n. 1. In agreement with Hayes is L. Habachi, ASAE, L " (I954), 443-562.
47id, n. 18. But see Sir Alan Gardiner, Revue d'Egyptologie, x (1955). 3<>-3i·
475b. The most significant new fragments were presented by R. A. Caminos, JEA, XLIV (1958), 3-4, Pis. II-VII. W . Helck deals with the geography of Syria in his Beziehungen Aegyptens zu Vorderasien im 3. und 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr. (Wiesbaden, 1962), 328-33.
476b. Another version (Caminos, opxit., PI. 11, 1. 10) gives the name as Iry-iry.
477a. For Shawe, cf. "the mountain Saue, the mountain which abuts on the Lebanon proper" (p. 282 above). For "bears," see the article by G. Posener in Orientalia NS, xm, (1944), 193-204.
477c. The text of Caminos, opxit., HI, 1. 10, gives biblical Edrei.
495c. A. Volten, Demotische Traumdeutung (Kopenhagen, 1942), compares two demotic texts with the text here presented. On the general subject, see L. Oppenheim, The Interpretation of Dreams in the Ancient Near East (Philadelphia, 1956).
653a. All the bibliographical references of the second edition of ANET have been retained for the record. Additional bibliographical information down to 1964 may be found in H. Donner and W.

Indexes






Index of Biblical References
THE purpose of the following index is to suggest to the
student of the Old Testament some significant points of
interest in the translations of the texts from the ancient
Near Eastern world. The index includes two types of
references: first, there are those references to the books
of the Old Testament which are listed in the introduc
tions and footnotes to the translations; secondly, there
is a listing of biblical analogues suggested by the various
contributors to the volume. By the listings of the latter
category neither the translators nor the editor venture
any scientific opinion with regard to the relationship
between the biblical reference and the text cited. Since
the noting of these possible biblical parallels was a by
product of the main work of attempting to render ac
curately the principal texts into English, it is not to be
expected that the list be comprehensive. It is intended
to be suggestive rather than exhaustive. Scholars who
approach this work from a primary concern for the
biblical material, it is to be hoped, will be able in sub
sequent years to enlarge gready upon this list. This
index should be used along with the index of names:
many biblical names of persons and places will be found
in the alphabetical listing there, rather than according
to the chapter and verse of the Bible.
According to the system of reference used here each
column of the page of this book is divided into two
halves: the first column of the page, into a and b\ the
second column, into c and d. When the biblical refer
ence does not actually appear printed in a footnote or in
an introduction to a translation, the reader must read
the entire quarter of the page of text or annotation in
order to judge what portion of it is intended as a pos
sible parallel to the biblical citation. The biblical ref
erences are listed according to the order and numbering
of the Hebrew Bible. Numberings used in the English
Bible have been given in parentheses.

Index of Names
INCLUDED in this index are the names of deities, demons,
persons, places, and other proper names which appear
in the translations of the texts. In addition this listing
includes the names of importance in the introductions
and in the footnotes. In choosing the names from the
footnotes and introductions some discretion has been
exercised in excluding the more general· geographical
designations which, if included, would have made the
index unnecessarily cumbersome. The simpler forms of the names (the spellings with
out diacritics) have been used in the index, even though
the reference is to a more technical spelling in the foot
notes, in the introductions, or within parentheses in
the text proper. In most cases the preferences of indi
vidual translators in the spelling of proper names have
been preserved in die alphabetical listings; the one ex
ception to this rule is in cases where the variant spell
ings appear in the adjacent positions in the index.
Identification of ancient place names should be sought
in the footnotes or within the parentheses following the
occurrence of the name in the translations, rather than
in the index itself. This procedure will enable the reader
to be more fully aware of the problems involved in some
of the proposed identifications.
In the alphabetical arrangement of the list the 'aleph
(') and the 'ayn (') have been disregarded for purposes
of classification. Likewise the Arabic article, el-, either
in this form, or when assimilated with the following
consonant, does not generally figure in the arrange
ment of the names. In the transliteration of some names
the Semitic 'ayn is transliterated by the 'aleph if the
name is from a cuneiform text
