links with अप-दान 'artifice' & Khuzestan, Susa, capital of
Elam, 4th m.BCE
Apadana is a large hypostyle hall, best said the great audience hall and portico at Persepolis and the palace of Susa. Susa was the old metropolis of Elam. Apadana, the Palace of Darius in Susa was a palace complex in Susa, Iran, a capital of the Achaemenid Empire. The construction was conducted parallel to that of Persepolis...The palace complex was constructed by the Achaemenid king Darius I in Susa, his favorite capital. Construction works continued under Darius I's son, Xerxes, and to a lesser extent, Artaxerxes I (465–424 BCE) and Darius II (423404 BCE). Artaxerxes II (404–358 BCE) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Darius_in_Susa
Apadana of Elam is an artifice and the semantics are cognate with Meluhha Indian sprachbund term, Pariyāpadāna, 'artifice'.
अप-दान n. ( √ दै?) , a great or noble work R. ii , 65 , 4 S3a1k. (v.l.);( in पालि for अव-दान q.v.) a legend treating of former and future births of men and exhibiting the consequences of their good and evil actions (Monier-Williams) Apadāna (nt.) 1. [= Sk. apadāna] removing, breaking off, D iii.88. -- 2. [= Sk. avadāna cp. ovāda] advice, admonition, instruction, morals Vin ii.4 (an ̊ not taking advice), 7 (id.) M i.96; A v.337 sq. (saddhā ̊) Th 1, 47. -- 3. legend, life history. In the title Mahāpadāna suttanta it refers to the 7 Buddhas. In the title Apadānaŋ, that is ʻ the stories ʼ, it refers almost exclusively to Arahants. The other, (older), connotation seems to have afterwards died out. See Dialogues ii.3. -- Pariyāpadāna (nt.) [pari+apadāna, the latter for ava ̊, and metrical lengthening of a] good advice, application, trick, artfulness, artifice J v.361, 369. (C. explns as parisuddha after v. l. pariyodāta which was prob. misread for pariyodāna), 370.
Charter foundation of the Susa apadana states: "The yaka timber was brought from Gandhara and frm Carmania. The gold was brought from Sardis and from Bactria which here was wrought. The precious stone lapis lazuli and carnelian which was wrought here, this was brought from Sogdiana. The precious stone turquoise, this was brought from Chorasmia which was wrought here. The silver and ebony were brought from Egypt. The ornamentation with which the wall was adorned, that from Ionia was brought. The ivory which was wrought here, was brought from Ethiopia and from Sind and from Arachosia. The stone columns which were here wrought, a village by name Abiradu in Elam -- from there were brought. The stone cutters who wrought the stone, those were Ionians and Sardians.The goldsmiths who wrought the gold, those were Medes and Egyptians.The men who wrought the wood, those were Sardians and Egyptians. The men who wrought the baked brick, those were Babylonians.The men who adorned the wall, those were Medes and Egyptians.The work Susa was one of excellence. Me may Ahuramazda protect me, Vistasp my father, and my country." (cf. Darius Dsf inscription http://www.avesta.org/op/op.htm#dsf ; Josef Wieshofer, 2001, Ancient Persia, IB Tauris, p.26.)

The ziggurat of Choqa Zanbil in Khuzestan was a magnificent structure of the Elamite Empire. Khuzestan's Elamites were "precursors of the royal Persians", and were "the founders of the first Iranian empire in the geographic sense." The name Khuzestan means "The Land of the Khuzi", and refers to the original inhabitants of this province, the "Susian" people (Old Persian "Huza", Middle Persian "Khuzi" or "Husa" (the Shushan of the Hebrew sources). The name of the city of Ahvaz also has the same origin as the name Khuzestan, being an Arabic broken plural from the compound name, "Suq al-Ahvaz" (Market of the Huzis)--the medieval name of the town, that replaced the Sasanian Persian name of the pre-Islamic times...Khouzhestan has been the land of Khouzhies who cultivate sugar cane even today in Haft Tepe...Archeological ruins verify the entire province of Khuzestan to be home to the Elamite civilization, a non-Semitic, and non-Indo-European-speaking kingdom, and "the earliest civilization of Persia" (According to: Sir Percy Sykes, A History of Persia, RoutledgeCurzon Publishers. 3rd edition. October 16, 2003, p.38) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuzestan_Province The name Khuzestan is derived from the Elamite (Ūvja)(According to The Cambridge History of Iran, 2, 259,) The Elamite word is

This suggestion is based on the fact that the 'unicorn' is a dominant memory from the days of the Sarasvati Civilization of the Bronze Age, ca. 3rd millennium BCE since the 'spiny-horned, young bull' is the most dominant hypertext of Indus Script Corpora.

Map of Elam. Location of Susa. Context, Persian Gulf. "Susa (also called Shushan, Greek Susiane), was one of the city-states of ancient Elam which later became the winter capital of the Persian Achaemenian kings (c. 675 - 330 BCE). There is evidence that Susa has been continuously inhabited from 4,200 BCE placing it among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. In addition, there are traces at Susa of a village inhabited around 7,000 BCE and painted pottery dating from ca. 5,000 BCE at the site...Alexander of Macedonia captured Susa in December 330 BCE and plundered the city, seizing some 40,000 talents of gold and silver from the treasury.
