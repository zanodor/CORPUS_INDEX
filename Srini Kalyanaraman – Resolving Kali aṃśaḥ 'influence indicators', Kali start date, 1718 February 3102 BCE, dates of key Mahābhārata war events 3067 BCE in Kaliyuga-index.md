Resolving Kali aṃśaḥ 'influence indicators', Kali start
date, 17/18 February 3102 BCE, dates of key
Mahābhārata war events 3067 BCE in Kaliyuga
Mahābhārata is the most accurately dated text to recount Story of Civilization of Bhāratam Janam. Adharma in Kaliyuga is the raison d'etre for Śrī K ̥rṣṇa's avatāra.
This monograph presents arguments for 17/18 February 3102 BCE and Mahābhārata war events 3067 BCE in Kaliyuga and discusses alternative dates suggested by astronomers. Courtesy the stellar work of Jayasree Saranathan and MM Pandit, I have collated the jyotiṣa pramāṇa and related textual citations. I am not a jyotiṣa and am a mere collator of evidences marshalled by astronomers and researchers.
बृहत् पराशर होरा शास्त्र ; bṛhat parāśara horā śāstra; abbreviated to BPHS) by Maharṣi Parāśara is the most comprehensive extant Śāstra on Vedic natal astrology, in particular the Horā branch (predictive astrology, e.g. horoscopes).(Likely from Greek ὥρα, although the BPHS (4.1-2) states that the word originates from ahorātra "day and night" after dropping its first and the last syllable. However, the alleged derivation of Sanskrit horā from ahorātra is not very likely, nor does it follow common rules of Sanskrit word formation. In Greek language, the word was part of common language since old times whereas in Sanskrit it exist only as an astrological expression.)
Venerable Parāśara, leader among Muni-Sages [said:] Jyotiṣa, the supreme limb of the Vedas, has three divisions - Horā, Gaṇita and Saṃhita. Excellent is Hora among the three distributions, consisting of the general part of Jyotisa.

In a concept of cyclical time, yuga is a continuum with संध्या sandhyā The period which precedes a Yuga, the time intervening between the expiration of one Yuga and the

commencement of another; चत्वार्ााहुः सहस्राणि वर्ाािां ृतत्कतं ुर्गम् । तस्य तावच्छती संध्या संध्यांशश्च तथाणवधुः ॥ Ms.1.69; अथासौ ुर्गसंध्यार्ां दुस्यप्राेुर्र्
राजसु Bhāg.1.3.25. and संध्या sandhyā and -अंशुः aṃśaḥ the period at the end of each Yuga;
Ms.1.69. Kali influence indicators are seen in these interval periods of 1) संध्या sandhyā and
2) संध्या sandhyā -अंशुः aṃśaḥ
This fine calibration of time continuum leads researchers to date Kaliyuga start date a) on a specific date, at the end of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra; or b) in a period of संध्या sandhyā which may last upto 100 years before the specific start date.
There are textual evidences which point to the start date of Kaliyuga to be the day on which Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra achieved its objective of killing Kamsa, even when Śrī K ̥rṣṇa was only a kiśora, 11-year youth. I submit that the totality of astronomical descriptions of skymaps provided in the Great Epic Mahābhārata point to November 3067 BCE as the date of the Great War since Śrī K ̥rṣṇa himself tells Śrī Balarāma Prāptaṃ kaliyugaṃ viddhi, says Sri K ̥rṣṇa MB 9.59.21 Śalyaparva: 'Kaliyuga has pierced in, arrived' providing the rationale for the unethical hit below the belt by Bhimasena during the Gadayuddham with Duryodhana.
The reason why 17/18 February 3102 BCE was chosen as the Kaliyuga start date for calendrical computations is explained the unique skymap of that date of extraordinary planetary alignments.
This is confirmed by the calendar in vogue during Mahābhārata times, the Jyotiṣavedāṅga of Lagadha is the pancānga in vogue in Mahābhārata kṣetra. Māgha Paurṇamāsa day is the start date of Kaliyuga; confirmed by Jyotiṣavedāṅga (of Lagadha) https://tinyurl.com/4uwevf5k
When sun and moon occupy the same region of the zodiac together with the asterism Dhanishta, at that time begins the Yuga, the month of Magha, the month called Tapas, the brightfortnight, and their northward course.

Narasimha, Varāha, Śrī Rāma, Śrī K ̥rṣṇa are परमात्म अंशुः , 'divine beings'. This is lucidly explained, as particular incarnations of the Supreme Divine, in B ̥rhat Parāsara Hora Śāstra; अंश, आवेश, and अवतार are the three kinds of Lord's manifestations.

Narasimha avatāra is to kill Hiraṇyakaśipu; Varāha avatāra is to kill Hiraṇyākṣa. Śrī Rāma avatāra Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra is to kill Kamsa.
All the avatāra are to restore dharma, to remove evil rulers. The four avatāra --Narasimha, Varāha, Rāma, K ̥rṣṇa -- are called परमात्म अंशुः , 'divine beings': परम parama, -आत्मन् m. the Supreme Spirit or Brahman; न च र्ोगणवधेनावेतरुः स्थथरधीरा परमात्मदशानात् R.8.22; स्वगाापवगार्ोमाागामामनस्ि मनीणर्िुः । र्दुपास्िमसावत्र परमात्मा णनरूप्यते ॥ Kusum, अंशुः aṃśaḥ अवतारुः -तरिम् [र् . त.] descent (on earth) of parts of deities, partial incarnation;  ̊तार इव धमास्य Dk.153;  ̊रणमव कृ तािस्य K.31;  ̊उचुःच् श्रवसुः 79; so अंशावतीिाणमव 108; N. of a subparvan covering Adhyāyas 64-67 of Ādiparvan of Mb. Even without the compound अंश means partial incarnation, अंश, आवेश, and अवतार are the three kinds of Lord's manifestations.

Great Incarnations
1. Maitreya: "O sage, are the incarnations of Vishnu, viz. Sri Rama, Sri Krishna etc. endowed with Jeevamsa?
2. Parasara: "O Brahmin, the four incarnations, viz. Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varatha are wholly with Paramatmamsa. The other incarnations (than these, out of the ten) have in them Jeevamsa too.
3-4. The Unborn lord has many incarnations. He has incarnated as the planets (Nava Grahas) to bestow on the living beings the results due to their Karmas. He is Janardana. He assumed the auspicious form of Grahas to destroy the demons (evil forces) and sustain the divine beings.
5-7. From the Sun God the incarnation of Rama, from the Moon that of Krishna, from Mars that of Narasimha, from Mercury that of Budha, from Jupiter that of Vamana, from Venus that of Parasu Rama, from Saturn that of Kurma, from Rahu that of Varaha and from Kethu that of Meena occurred. All other incarnations than these also are through the Grahas. The beings with more Paramatmamsa are called divine beings.
8-13. The beings with more Jeevatmamsa are (mortal) beings. The high degree of Paramatmamsa from the Grahas, viz. Sun, etc. did incarnate as Rama, Krishna, etc.. After completing the mission, the Paramatmamsas (of the respective) Grahas again merge (in the respective) Grahas. The Jeevatma portions from the Grahas take births as human beings and live their lives according to their Karmas and again merge in the Grahas. And at the time of Great Destruction, the Grahas as well merge in the Lord Vishnu. One who knows of all these, will become versed in the knowledge of the past, present, and future. Without a knowledge of astrology these cannot be known. Hence everyone should have a knowledge of Astrology particularly the Brahmin. One who, devoid of astrological knowledge, blames this science will go to the hell called 'Raurava', and will be reborn blind.

After the death of Jarāsandha in 3080 BCE, his son Sahadeva took refuge with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who crowned him King of Mathurāpurī. (Mahābhārata Southern text, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 24).
Sahadeva ruled for after the death of Jarāsandha. Sahadeva died in the MBh war.
Since Sahadeva became the ruler after the death of Jarāsandha, we can determine the date of death of Jarāsandha: the death of Jarāsandha occurred in 3067 BCE + 13 = 3080 BCE.
Earlier, in 3102 BCE, 11-year youth, kiśora, 'youth' Śrī K ̥rṣṇa had killed Kamsa, as part of his avatāra, mission of incarnation of the Supreme Divine.
Sahadeva (सहदेव).—A son of Jarāsandha
Facts gleaned from the Mahābhārata:
Asti and Prāpti, two wives, of Kaṃsa were the sisters of this Sahadeva. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 31).
He was present at the wedding of Draupadī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 8).
After the death of Jarāsandha he took refuge with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who crowned him King of Mathurāpurī. (Mahābhārata Southern text, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 24).
In the great war he came to the help of Yudhiṣṭhira with one akṣauhiṇī (division of army). (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 8).
He was one of the seven Mahārathins of the Pāṇḍava army. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 187, Verse 11).
He was killed in the great war by Droṇa. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 225, Verse 45).
Sahadeva (सहदेव).—The son of Jarāsandha. He took the side of the Pāṇḍavas during the Kurukṣetra war and was killed by Droṇa.

आरात्कलेरागमनं कमामूलणनकृ िनम् ।। ११ ।। (ब्रह्मवचवतापुरािम् /खुःण्ड ४ (श्रीकृ ष्णजन्मखुःण्ड ). Approach of Kali, destroyer of germs of good deeds, is impending or near at hand.
आगमनं āgamanam (of Kali) 'arrival' PLUS आरात् ārāt 'immediate'; thus, immediate arrival is signified by this expression.
Thus, 18 Feb. 3102 BCE is the date of start of Kaliyuga when Śrī K ̥rṣṇa kills Kamsa; the date is affirmed by Jyotiṣa siddhantin with reference to the skychart which shows extraordinary assemblage of planets heralding itihāsa unfolding, dharma restored.
This श्रीकृ ष्णजन्मखुःण्ड ह्मब्रवचवतापुरािम् reference is emphatic Jyotiṣa pramāṇa. This relates to Śrī K ̥rṣṇa's life as kiśora 11-year youth in Goloka; the context is early life of Krishna. His birth is at 11.40 PM Friday 27 July 3112 BCE.
Translation of this textual evidence by Rajendra Nath Sen:
The approach of Kali, the destroyer of the germs of good deeds, is impending or near at hand. On the approach of Kali, there will be no distinction between persons of different castes. (Translation by Rajendra Nath Sen, 1920) https://archive.org/details/brahmavaivartapu04allauoft/page/548/mode/2up
I find this evidence compelling that KaliYuga arrival is IMPENDING.
आरात्कलेरागमनं This expression is a compound of two terms: आगमनं āgamanam (of Kali)
PLUS आरात् ārāt. The reading, translation is: Kali arrival is IMMEDIATE.
ā-gamana means ‘arrival’; ā-gamana n. (ifc. f(ā). , Kathās. ) coming, approaching, arriving, returning, KātyŚr. ; MBh. āgamana n. ʻ arrival ʼ MBh.

आरात् ārāt means 'immediately, directly’ (Apte) ārāt ‘directly,immediately’, Prab.; Kathās.;Śak.131a (Monier-Williams)
If Goloka period of Krishna's life is as a kiśora, he should be about 11 years of age when the indication is emphatically stated that arrival of Kali is direct, immediate. I submit that this arrival is in 3102 BCE when Krishna, kiśora is 11 year youth (DOB 3112 BCE).

I present below excerpts from the well-documented Wikipedia entry on Kaliyuga.
The Brahma-vaivarta Purana has words spoken by Krishna to Mother Ganga just before the beginning of the Kali Yuga (the age of quarrel and strife). The Kali Yuga began approximately five thousand years ago, that golden age is being described below by Krishna. Predicted in Brahma-vaivarta Purana 4.129. The fourth part of the Brahma-vaivarta is called Kṛṣṇa-janma-khanda. Chapter 129 is called Golokarohanam, because it describes how Krishna returns to His abode. This specific dialogue is between Krishna and Mother Ganga. Verse 49 is a question by Ganga, verses 50–60 are Krishna's answer.
This text is taken from the Brahma-vaivarta Purana [14] Text 59:
kaler daṣa-sahasrāṇi madbhaktāḥ santi bhūtale ekavarṇā bhaviṣyanti madbhakteṣu gateṣu ca
For 10,000 years of Kali such devotees of Mine will be present on earth. After the departure of My devotees there will be only one varna.
The above is supported in 4.90.32–33:
kalau daṣa-sahasrāṇi haris tiṣṭhati medinī devānām pratimā pūjyā śāstrāni ca purāṇakam
(Sri Krisna said:) Lord Hari will stay on this earth for the first ten-thousand years of Kaliyuga. Till then gods will be worshipped and the Puranas and scriptures will also be present.
"According to the astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata, Kali Yuga started in 3102 BCE. He finished his book Aryabhattiyam in 499 CE, in which he gave the exact year of the beginning of Kali Yuga. He writes that he wrote the book in the "year 3600 of the Kali Age" at the age of 23. As it was the 3600th year of the Kali Age when he was 23 years old, and given that Aryabhata was born in 476 CE, the beginning of the Kali Yuga would come to

(3600 - (476 + 23) + 1 (One year from 1 BCE to 1 CE)) = 3102 BCE.(H.D. Dharm Chakravarty Swami Prakashanand Saraswati. Encyclopedia Of Authentic Hinduism The True History and the Religion of India, Hardbound, 2nd Edition, 2003)
,,,
According to K. D. Abhyankar, the starting point of Kali Yuga is an extremely rare planetary alignment....Going by this alignment, the year 3102 BCE is slightly off. The actual date for this alignment is 7 February 3104 BCE. There is also sufficient proof to believe that Vrdhha Garga knew of precessions at least by 500 BCE. Garga had calculated the rate of precession to within 30% of what the modern scholars estimate. (Abhyankar, K. D. (1993). "Astronomical significance to two Mohenjodaro seals". Astronomical Society of India, Bulletin. 21 (3–4): 477.)
...According to the Surya Siddhanta, Kali Yuga began at midnight (00:00) on 18 February 3102 BCE.(Matchett, Freda; Yano, Michio (2003).

(17) A year (of men) is equal to a day and night of the gods ... (19) I shall, in their order, tell you the number of years that are for different purposes calculated differently, in the Krita, the Treta, the Dwapara, and the Kali yugas. (20) Four thousand celestial years is the duration of the first or Krita age. The morning of that cycle consists of four hundred years and its evening is of four hundred years. (21) Regarding the other cycles, the duration of each gradually

decreases by a quarter in respect of both the principal period with the minor portion and the conjoining portion itself.

(67) A year is a day and a night of the gods ... (68) But hear now the brief (description of) the duration of a night and a day of Brahman and of the several ages (of the world, yuga) according to their order. (69) They declare that the Krita age (consists of) four thousand years (of the gods); the twilight preceding it consists of as many hundreds, and the twilight following it of the same number. (70) In the other three ages with their twilights preceding and following, the thousands and hundreds are diminished by one (in each).
Surya Siddhanta, Ch. 1:(Burgess, Rev. Ebenezer (1935) [1860]. "Ch. 1: Of the Mean Motions of the Planets.". In Gangooly, Phanindralal (ed.). Translation of the Surya-Siddhanta, A TextBook of Hindu Astronomy; With notes and an appendix. University of Calcutta. pp. 7–9 (1.13–17).)
(13) ... twelve months make a year. This is called a day of the gods. (14) ... Six times sixty [360] of them are a year of the gods ... (15) Twelve thousand of these divine years are denominated a Quadruple Age (caturyuga); of ten thousand times four hundred and thirty-two [4,320,000] solar years (16) Is composed that Quadruple Age, with its dawn and twilight. The difference of the Golden and the other Ages, as measured by the difference in the number of the feet of Virtue in each, is as follows : (17) The tenth part of an Age, multiplied successively by four, three, two, and one, gives the length of the Golden and the other Ages, in order : the sixth part of each belongs to its dawn and twilight.
...
Hinduism often symbolically represents morality (dharma) as an Indian bull. In Satya Yuga, the first stage of development, the bull has four legs, which is reduced by one in each age that follows. By the age of Kali, morality is reduced to only a quarter of that of the golden age, so that the bull of Dharma has only one leg.("The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Markandeya-Samasya Parva: Section CLXXXIX"; Bhāgavata Purāṇa 1.16.20).
...
A discourse by Markandeya in the Mahabharata identifies some of the attributes of Kali Yuga.[32]
In relation to rulers, it lists:
• Rulers will become unreasonable: they will levy taxes unfairly. • Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world. • "At the end of Kali-yuga, when there exist no topics on the subject of God, even at the residences of so-called saints and respectable gentlemen of the three higher varnas (guna or temperament) and when nothing is known of the techniques of sacrifice, even by word, at that time the Lord will appear as the supreme chastiser." (Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.7)
With regard to human relationships, Markandeya's discourse says:



11
• Avarice and wrath will be common. Humans will openly display animosity towards each other. Ignorance of dharma will occur. • Religion, truthfulness, cleanliness, tolerance, mercy, physical strength and memory diminish with each passing day. • People will have thoughts of murder with no justification and will see nothing wrong in that. • Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life. • Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish. • People will become addicted to intoxicating drinks and drugs. • Gurus will no longer be respected and their students will attempt to injure them. Their teachings will be insulted, and followers of Kama will wrest control of the mind from all human beings. • All the human beings will declare themselves as gods or boon given by gods and make it as a business instead of teachings. • People will no longer get married and live with each other just for sexual pleasure. • Weather and environment will degrade with time and frequent and unpredictable rainfalls will happen. • Earthquakes will be common. • Maximum age of humans will be 20 years by the end of Kali Yuga. • Many fake ideologies will spread throughout the world. • The powerful people will dominate the poor people. • Many diseases will spread. • At the end of Kali Yuga, Vishnu will take birth on earth as Kalki to wipe out the sinners. It is mentioned that Vishnu's Kalki avatar will come to the Earth in a white horse which has wings (here, the destruction caused by the white horse is used as a metaphor for the destruction of darkness in the minds of the human beings).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga
"According to the Manusmriti ...,one of the earliest known texts describing the yugas, the length of each yuga is 4800, 3600, 2400 and 1200 years of the gods, respectively, giving a total of 12,000 divine years to complete one cycle. For human years, they are multiplied by 360 giving 1,728,000, 1,296,000, 864,000 and 432,000 years, respectively, giving a total of 4,320,000 human years. These four yugas have a length ratio of 4:3:2:1.The Bhagavata Purana [3.11.18-20] (c. 500-1000 CE) gives a matching description of the yuga lengths in divine years.The Kali Yuga is the present yuga. According to Puranic sources, Krishna's departure marks the end of Dvapara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102 BCE, 35 years after the Mahabharata war of 3067 BCE."
