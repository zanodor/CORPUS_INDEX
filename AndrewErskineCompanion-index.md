A COMPANION
TO THE
HELLENISTIC
WORLD
Edited by
Andrew Erskine






`This extremely appealing collection pulls of f that hardest of tricks: it is simultan
eously authoritative and exciting, its findings new as well as true. The Hellenistic age
was an age of mar vels and this impeccably edited work is itself a Hellenistic mar vel.
Scholars, students and interested non-professionals will devour it with pleasure and
go away nourished, as I did.'
Professor Simon Hornblower, University College London
`Blackwell and Erskine have done a splendid job with the HellenisticCompanion and
I'm extremely pleased to have a copy, both as a guide for my own contributions and
for future reference. It is, I think, the best comprehensive book on the Hellenistic
world available and a ``must have'' for ever yone working in this field.'
Professor Waldemar Heckel, University of Calgary
`The Companion to the Hellenistic World is very impressive indeed both in its breadth
and its depth, and sets an exhilaratingly high standard for the new series.'
Professor Justina Gregory, Smith College

Preface
This Companion to the Hellenistic World was conceived during a sabbatical in Rome
in Jubilee year 2000. The initial invitations were mailed from an internet caf Âe close
to the Pantheon; the first contributor was gained over a meal in Trastevere and not
a little grappa. The resulting volume presents a wide-ranging picture of the Hellenis
tic world and gives a sense of the vitality of recent scholarship. Hellenistic histor y
shades into Roman histor y, and the Companion seeks to integrate the two rather than
merely nod acknowledgement to Rome with a final chapter. It is Frank Walbank who
has done so much to explore this interplay and it is to him that this collection is
dedicated.
My task as editor has been made easier by the enthusiasm and ef ficiency of all the
contributors and by the constant encouragement of Al Ber trand at Blackwell. The
typescript was guided through its final stages by Angela Cohen and Louise Spencely. I
am par ticularly grateful to Joan Wright for translating chapter 13 from its original
German. Wolfgang Blu È mel, Andy Meadows and Christine Morris all kindly gave me
assistance with illustrations. And Michelle I would like to thank for things too
numerous to mention.

CHAPTER ONE
Approaching the Hellenistic
W orld
Andrew Erskine
1 Alexander's Legacy
After his victor y at Actium in 31 B C Augustus pursued his defeated rivals, Antony and
Kleopatra, to Alexandria in Egypt. After capturing the city, he soon had the oppor
tunity to view its sights. One of the few places he is known to have visited during his
residence there is the tomb of Alexander the Great. Rome's future emperor is said to
have reverently placed a golden crown on the embalmed body laid out in front of him
and then scattered flowers on it. When asked if he would also like to see the tombs of
Ptolemies, the Greco-Macedonian dynasty that had ruled over Egypt since the death
of Alexander, he abruptly dismissed the suggestion, saying that `he wanted to see a
king, not some corpses'. So, at least, reports Suetonius in the early second centur yA D
(Suet. Aug. 18, cf. Dio 51.16, Erskine 2002a).
This stor y in many ways captures the Hellenistic Age. It was the transforming
power of Alexander that brought Alexandria into existence, a major Greek city which
had grown up in the foreign land of Egypt, something which would have been
unthinkable to a Greek of the fifth centur y B C . Here, as the dead Alexander lies
before the new ruler of the world, the beginning and the end of the Hellenistic period
meet, Alexander the Macedonian king who changed the East by his conquest of the
Persian empire, Augustus the Roman who over threw the last of the successor king
doms with his occupation of Ptolemaic Egypt. The Ptolemies themselves are of no
interest; they are simply written out of histor y, and with them go the centuries that
inter vened between Alexander and the coming of Rome. The Roman emperors
wanted to look back to the almost mythical figure of Alexander; they saw themselves
as heirs not to the kingdoms that developed out of Alexander's empire but as the heirs
of Alexander himself.
Of course Augustus may never have uttered the disparaging comment attributed to
him by Suetonius; such anecdotes tend to evolve with each telling. Nonetheless, the
dismissive outlook evident in the stor y reflects a general and continuing neglect of the
Greek world after Alexander. From antiquity onwards this has been seen as a period of
decline, both political and cultural. The great figures of the Greek past were to be



found in earlier times, not in the years following Alexander. This way of thinking
about the past was not limited to Romans; Greeks of the early empire would often
by-pass their Hellenistic ancestors and look for inspiration to the Classical period.
A complex attitude can already be detected during the reign of Augustus; Latin poets
may have admired and emulated their Alexandrian predecessors but a critic such as
Dionysios of Halikarnassos could see Alexander as marking a turning-point in literar y
culture and one for the worse (cf. Gelzer 1979). This has had impor tant conse
quences for the study of the Hellenistic world. Whereas Classical literature was valued
and preser ved, its post-Alexander counterpar t has sur vived only ver y poorly.
This neglect was to continue until the nineteenth centur y when Johann-Gustav
Droysen vir tually invented the Hellenistic period in a series of studies devoted to
Alexander and his successors. For him Alexander's conquests led to a fusion of Greek
and Oriental culture that eventually gave Christianity the oppor tunity to flourish.
Since the publication of Droysen's work the discover y of new inscriptions and papyri
has provided historians with an ever-increasing wealth of evidence to exploit, allowing
a far more subtle and nuanced picture to emerge.
Nonetheless, in spite of the work of some great scholars the Hellenistic world has
never received the same degree of attention as its Classical predecessor. The domin
ance of Classics as an academic discipline among the elite of more modern times has
kept the ancient world alive but it has also tended to exclude those areas that have less
to contribute to Classics as traditionally understood. It is therefore the periods that
produce the literar y canon that are most studied: Classical Greece (Herodotos,
Thucydides, tragedy), Republican Rome (Cicero, Sallust), the Roman Empire
(Horace, Vergil, Tacitus). To appreciate the Hellenistic world one must abandon
the value system that sees the centuries after Alexander as some kind of epilogue to
the achievement of Classical Greece. Increasing interest in Hellenistic literature,
philosophy and ar t in their own right suggests that this is changing, perhaps in par t
as a result of the recent decline of traditional Classics, but also because academics,
however categorized, are asking dif ferent questions about both present and past.
On the simplest level the Hellenistic period is defined and bounded by political
events. Alexander's conquest of the sprawling Persian empire marks the beginning,
but his premature death in 323 B C was followed by the fragmentation of his posses
sions as leading figures in the Macedonian militar y struggled for control. Out of these
conflicts emerged three main dynasties: the Antigonids in the Macedonian homeland;
the Seleukids in Asia; and the Ptolemies in Egypt, supplemented in the later third
centur y by the Attalids in Asia Minor. The period traditionally ends with the fall of the
Ptolemaic kingdom to Rome after Actium, the culmination of two centuries of
Roman success in the East. All historical periods are in some sense the arbitrar y
constructs of historians. If political events are the criteria, then establishing the end
of the Hellenistic period is problematic. Alexander may have created a dramatic and
decisive beginning but the end is not so neat; the extension of Roman power
occurred gradually, af fecting dif ferent areas at dif ferent times. The disappearance of
the last of the successor kingdoms is a convenient terminal point rather than one of
profound significance. The present volume takes the narrative of events through to
the death of Augustus, in order to allow some consideration of Augustus' role in the
creation of a Roman East.
2 Andrew Erskine



As Droysen saw, however, the Hellenistic period is as much a cultural phenomenon
as a political one. It may have its origins in a political event ± the demise of the Persian
empire ± but that event was to have enormous repercussions beyond politics,
repercussions that would not recognize Actium as a boundar y. When the Greco
Macedonian elite took power throughout much of the east, they not only replaced
the old order, they also brought their own way of life. Greek cities were founded and
developed ± centres of Greek culture and language in an alien environment, cities
such as Alexandria in Egypt, Antioch on the Orontes, Seleukeia on the Tigris, or in
the far east the Greek settlements in Baktria, now in modern Afghanistan. A sign of
the cultural change that had taken place was the location of the world's largest
collection of Greek books; this librar y was to be found not in Athens nor in one of
the old Greek cities but in Egypt. Change, of course, is always easier to notice than
continuity and it is impor tant not to overlook the latter. To understand the Hellenis
tic world it is essential to grasp both.
Greek communities and culture settled among non-Greek populations. It is the
resulting cultural interaction that of fers one of the more fascinating areas of study. Its
extent and nature have been the subject of considerable debate: in which direction did
influence go? Or did Greeks and non-Greeks remain largely separate? What did it
mean anyway to be Greek? What was the relationship between immigrant and native,
between town and countr y? To what extent did non-Greeks, such as Iranians or
Egyptians, par ticipate in the royal administration and up to what level? The answers
and approaches to such questions may change from region to region. The area
conquered by Alexander was vast and varied; its ver y diversity acts as a warning
against too uniform a response, a point increasingly stressed in modern scholarship.
Greek culture may have been new to Baktria but there had long been coexistence and
interaction in Asia Minor between Greeks and Karians, Greeks and L ykians, and so
on. And the Greeks of Asia Minor were in any case ver y dif ferent from those of say
Athens or Spar ta. Other areas may rarely have seen a Greek.
The present volume begins with a section of narrative before adopting a thematic
approach. Some chapters are concerned with subjects that have long interested
students of Hellenistic histor y, others are less familiar. Topics may var y ± dynasties,
religion, the polis (city-state), local tradition, geography ± but underlying themes
recur ± regionalism and diversity, cultural interaction, ethnicity, change and continu
ity. Old cer tainties have disappeared; it used, for instance, to be commonplace to
lament the death of the polis, crushed by the rise of the kings, but now there is an
increasing tendency to stress the vitality of civic life.
It is the legacy of Alexander, both political and cultural, that gives the Hellenistic
period its sense of unity and coherence. This may lead to an over-emphasis on the
Greek at the expense of what is more regional. Alternative perspectives are pos
sible. The Seleukids when considered as par t of the histor y of Iran may look rather
dif ferent from the dynasty presented as par t of Greco-Macedonian histor y. From
the perspective of a student of Greek histor y Alexander can be viewed as the founder
of the Hellenistic world, but a historian of the Persian or Achaimenid empire
might reasonably hold him to be `the last of the Achaimenids' (Briant 1996: 896).
Thus our ideas of change and continuity are themselves dependent on emphasis
and perspective.
Approaching the Hellenistic World 3



2 Reviewing the Evidence
The Classical period of fers the historian a series of dominating texts ± Herodotos,
Thucydides, Xenophon ± which shape the way we think about the period and
establish a framework for further investigation. The Hellenistic world, on the other
hand, has none of this, a circumstance that is at once both frustrating and liberating.
There are no contemporar y narrative histories until Polybios' account of the rise of
Rome appears in the mid-second centur y B C and even here, disappointingly, much of
his text is now lost. Nor can too much enlightenment be sought among later
historians whose coverage of the Hellenistic period is sketchy at best.
There has always been a tendency for scholars investigating the ancient world to
prioritize histories but the study of ancient histor y has changed over time. Its goal is
not simply (if it ever was) to produce a political narrative; issues, such as economic
activity, gender, ethnicity and cultural change, are at the forefront of current historical
investigations; yet the emphasis on the impor tance of historical texts remains. There is
often a sense, not shared by historians of more modern periods, that histor y is merely
a commentar y on these ancient texts.
The historian of the Hellenistic period might regret the lack of such texts and the
resulting haziness in narrative and chronology, but there is much by way of compen
sation. In par ticular there is no shor tage of alternative source material: large quan
tities of papyri unear thed in Egypt, the inscriptions that were so much par t of Greek
civic life, coins minted by cities and kings, continuing archaeological discoveries,
both through excavation and sur vey. This body of evidence is growing all the time.
A satisfactor y narrative may be elusive but the variety and richness of the source
material available gives the historian the chance to confront other questions and
issues. Thus, for example, although individual wars, such as the Second Syrian War
or the Chremonidean War, may be badly documented, much can said about the
phenomenon of war fare itself.
The challenge lies in combining all this evidence, material that often pulls in
dif ferent directions. Papyri tell of administration and life in rural Egypt, inscriptions
reveal something of the values and society of Greek cities, literar y texts focus on
personalities and kings. What sur vives is a par tial and in some ways rather fragmented
picture, oriented towards the Greek elite. The non-Greek inhabitants of this world
are not, however, completely without a voice, although it still tends to be the elite
who speak, sometimes in Greek, sometimes in native languages. Texts appear on
various materials and in various scripts; there is Egyptian in hieroglyphs and demotic,
Akkadian on cuneiform tablets from Babylonia, Hebrew from Judaea. These can of fer
a dif ferent perspective, although they are not so plentiful as we might want nor are
they so familiar to classically-trained historians. The rest of this chapter will offer a
sur vey of the written evidence available, beginning with the Greco-Roman literar y
tradition, before turning to inscriptions and papyri, and finally to non-Greek voices
from the Hellenistic world. The handling of the evidence of archaeology and ar t is
treated elsewhere in this volume (Alcock et al.; Stewar t).

3 Literature
The lack of contemporar y histories means that students of the Hellenistic world must
often turn to later writers, who may have lived centuries after the events they are
describing. Even here the focus is much greater on some periods than others;
Alexander's reign and the wars with Rome attract the most attention.
The only Hellenistic histor y to sur vive in any quantity is the study of Rome's rise to
power written by Polybios in the second centur y B C . Polybios was a member of a
distinguished family from Megalopolis in the Peloponnese; he had been a high
ranking official in the Achaian League, one of the more powerful confederacies in
Greece, but after the Roman victor y over the Macedonian king Perseus in 168 his
political career came to an abrupt end. The following year he was among a thousand
Achaians depor ted to Italy where he was compelled to remain until 150. He used this
enforced leisure in Rome to begin his histor y, an ambitious work of high quality in
for ty books which took the whole Mediterranean as its subject. After two introduc
tor y books the histor y proper commences with the 140
th Olympiad (220±216 B C ),
the date at which he believed the histor y of Italy and Libya merged with that of
Greece and Asia (1.3). He sought to explain to his fellow Greeks `how and by what
sor t of government in less than 53 years the Romans came to conquer and rule almost
the whole inhabited world' (1.1.5). These 53 years ended with the fall of the
Macedonian kingdom in 168/7, but he later decided to extend his histor y so that
it covered not only Rome's acquisition of power (bks 3±29) but also the years that
followed, up to 145/44 (bks 30±39). As a contemporar y obser ver he of fers a rare
insight into Roman expansion and the Greek reaction to it, but his work is not
exclusively concentrated on Rome; there is, for instance, an impor tant account of
the histor y of the Achaian League, much about the early years of Antiochos III, a
vivid picture of disturbances in Alexandria. Only the first five books are intact, the
remainder sur viving in `fragments', albeit some quite substantial. These are largely
the work of Byzantine excerptors, although numerous citations can also be found in
Strabo, Athenaeus and Plutarch. Some idea of what is missing can be obtained from
the Latin historian Livy, who used Polybios extensively as his source for events in the
east in books 31±45 of his histor y of Rome, although his work too is incomplete,
ending in 167 B C .
Other historians from the Hellenistic period are for the most par t only known
through the work of their successors. Lost are the early writers on Alexander, such as
Aristoboulos of Kassandreia (FGrH 139), Kallisthenes of Olynthos (FGrH 124),
Kleitarchos (FGrH 137) and Ptolemy I of Egypt (FGrH 138); so too are the major
third-centur y figures, Douris of Samos, Hieronymos of Kardia, Phylarchos, and
Timaios of Tauromenion. Douris' writings included a histor y of Macedonia from
370 through to the time of the battle of Koroupedion in 281, a histor y of Samos of
which he was tyrant, and a rather sensational biography of fellow tyrant Agathokles of
Sicily (FGrH 76). Hieronymos' histor y, spanning the years from the death of Alexan
der in 323 to the death of Pyrrhos in 272, is probably the most serious loss from this
Approaching the Hellenistic World 5



period. He was closely involved in the struggles of the successors, in the ser vice first of
his compatriot Eumenes and after wards of the early Antigonids, and was conse
quently well-informed if slightly par tial. Much used by later writers such as Diodoros
and Plutarch, his work appears to have been of an especially high standard ( FGrH
154). Phylarchos covered the central section of the third centur y, moving from the
death of Pyrrhos to the death of the Spar tan king Kleomenes in 220/19. His
sympathetic por trait of the revolutionar y Kleomenes, which features prominently in
Plutarch's Lives of Agis and Kleomenes, provoked the Achaian Polybios to subject
Phylarchos to a savage critique (FGrH 81; Polyb. 2.56±63). The Sicilian historian
Timaios was another victim of Polybian polemic; he is criticized for spending too
much time with books, not seeing cities and places for himself, and lacking political
and militar y experience, charges that reveal much about Polybios' own conception of
histor y. Timaios was, nonetheless, a ver y influential historian who wrote extensively
on the western Greeks during some fifty years spent as an exile in Athens (FGrH 566;
Polyb. 12). The most impor tant lost work from the later Hellenistic period is
probably the continuation of Polybios written by the Stoic polymath Poseidonios
from Apameia in Syria. One of the leading intellectuals of the first centur y B C and
close to members of the Roman elite, he wrote a histor y in 52 books covering the
years from 146 to the 80s B C .
These lost writers form the basis of the accounts that sur vive; sometimes they are
cited by name, at other times material is unattributed, leaving modern historians to
speculate on a likely source. Named citations are rather misleadingly referred to as
`fragments', a term that suggests that they are verbatim quotations that have some
how become displaced from their original text. Occasionally this may indeed be the
case, for instance if the text has been preser ved on papyrus, or is among the extracts
from historians collected for the Byzantine emperor, Constantine VII Porphyrogen
itus. More often these citations are abridgements or re-wordings of what was written
and may even have been reproduced from memor y. Some abridgements can be
substantial, notably the so-called Bibliotheca, or `Librar y', of Photios, a ninth centur y
A D scholar who wrote numerous summaries of books he had read. These included
works now completely lost, such as On the Red Sea by Agatharchides of Knidos
(FGrH 86) or the histor y of his home-town written by Memnon of Herakleia Pontike
(FGrH 434). The modern historian needs to be war y of placing too much faith in
the evidence of such `fragments'; far from of fering an authentic glimpse at a lost
text, the process of selection, re-wording, and abridgement may have done much to
distor t the original work (cf. Brunt 1980).
Alexander's career is well documented in later writers; Arrian and Q. Cur tius Rufus
both wrote histories of his reign, Diodoros of Sicily devoted book 17 of his world
histor y to the Macedonian king, and Plutarch included a life of Alexander among his
Parallel Lives. The most authoritative treatment was written in the second centur yA D
by Arrian, a distinguished Greek author from Nikomedia in Bithynia, whose friend
ship with the emperor Hadrian brought him a consulship. His self-consciously stylish
histor y was based primarily on the writings of Ptolemy I, who ser ved as an of ficer with
Alexander before establishing himself as king of Egypt, and of Aristoboulos, who also
accompanied Alexander on campaign. Arrian concluded with the death of Alexander,
but he also wrote ten lost books entitled The Affairs after Alexander, which covered
the four years after the king's death; in addition to a summar y by Photios some quite
6 Andrew Erskine



lengthy fragments of this sur vive on papyrus and in medieval manuscripts ( FGrH
156; Dreyer 1999b). Cur tius' account in ten books, composed in the first or second
centur y A D and extending as far as the immediate aftermath of Alexander's death, may
be admirable as a moralizing work of rhetoric, but as histor y it is less satisfactor y.
It is to the Augustan age that we owe the only extant narratives of the hundred
years or so which followed Alexander's death, one in Greek by Diodoros, the other in
Latin by Pompeius Trogus, although Trogus is known only through a later and not
always reliable abridgement composed by a cer tain Justin. Both are universal histor
ies, that is to say they take the histor y of the world as their subject, or rather the
Greco-Roman world. Their composition at this time and the emphasis they place on
the Hellenistic period may indicate a sense of closure, a realization that Rome now
controlled the East and that the era of the great kingdoms was over. Diodoros'
histor y, written in for ty books between approximately 60 and 30 B C , began in the
mythological past and extended until 60 B C . It thus included Pompey's victor y over
Mithradates and the subsequent reorganization of the East which resulted in the end
of the Seleukid kingdom. The implications of this would not have escaped Diodoros
who records Pompey's verdict on his own achievement: he `brought the limits of
Roman rule to the limits of the ear th' (Diod. 40.4). Pompeius Trogus, a Gaul who
wrote a histor y in 44 books some years after Diodoros, showed a similar awareness,
but for him it is with Augustus that the whole world becomes Roman (Just. 44.8). At
this point universal histor y turns into Roman histor y.
In books 18±20 Diodoros provides a valuable narrative of the turbulent years after
the death of Alexander, years during which the king's successors (known as the
Diadochoi) battled with each other for power and territor y. For his material Diodoros
is usually believed to have drawn heavily on Hieronymos of Kardia, a belief which has
helped to give his account greater authority. Book 20, which ends in 302 with the
prelude to the battle of Ipsos, is, however, the last book to sur vive complete, the
remaining twenty known mainly through Photios and Byzantine excerpts. It is left,
therefore, to Pompeius Trogus, as processed by Justin, to tell the narrative of the
third centur y. Whether Justin was selecting the par ts he liked, abridging Trogus, or
doing both, is not clear; it is possible that Justin's text is as little as one tenth the
length of Trogus' original text. Never theless, whatever Justin was doing, he has
bequeathed a ver y unsatisfactor y and often sketchy narrative to generations of frus
trated historians, yet one that of fers tantalizing sights of other wise unknown events.
Once the Romans become involved in the East, our knowledge of the narrative
becomes better, but its Romano-centric character means that the record can be silent
when Rome has no one to fight there. In addition to Polybios and Livy, there is
Appian, an Alexandrian Greek who in the second centur y A D wrote a histor y of
Rome's conquest of the world. Rather than organizing his histor y on strictly chrono
logical principles, he structured it around the peoples conquered by the Romans, an
approach which ser ved to emphasize the geographic and ethnographic extent of the
Roman empire. Valuable where more reliable sources are lost, Appian is especially
useful for events in the first centur y B C , in par ticular for Rome's wars with Mithra
dates.
The narrative and nature of the Hellenistic world can be fur ther illuminated by
others whose writings are not directly historical. Three stand out: Plutarch, Pausanias
and Strabo. Plutarch, an extraordinarily prolific and wide-ranging writer from
Approaching the Hellenistic World 7



Chaironeia in Boiotia, was active in the late first and early second centur y A D . In
addition to numerous essays collected together now under the title, theMoralia, his
output included a series of biographies, the Parallel Lives, in which illustrious Greeks
are paired with Roman counterparts; his prime concern here is with the moral
character of his subjects. He treats a number of leading Hellenistic figures, though
significantly none of the major monarchs; there are no lives of such as Seleukos I,
Ptolemy I, or Antiochos III. Instead we read of those who evince the spirit of Classical
Greece, men who tr y to stand up for the polis against the great powers, the Athenian
Phokion, the Achaians Aratos and Philopoimen, the revolutionar y kings of Spar ta,
Agis and Kleomenes. Several Lives do feature those who operate outside the polis but
they tend to be the unor thodox and atypical: Eumenes of Kardia, Greek secretar y of
Alexander turned warlord, Demetrios Poliorketes, the womanizing, heavy-drinking
son of Antigonos the One-eyed, Pyrrhos, king of Epeiros and Alexandermanque Â. His
Roman Lives include some who were commanders in wars in the East, notably,
T. Quinctius Flamininus, L. Aemilius Paullus, Sulla and Pompey. Together all these
lives with their characterization and anecdote add personality to our image of the
Hellenistic age.
A ver y dif ferent type of text is the Geography of Strabo of Amaseia, a native of
Pontos writing during the reign of Augustus. This seventeen-book opus takes as its
subject not people or events but places, and thus encapsulates the known world at the
conclusion of the Hellenistic period. It is as if Augustus has brought histor y to an end
and all that is left is to describe the world Rome rules. As Strabo moves around the
Mediterranean, he tells of the cities that populate it, their present and their past;
Korakesion prompts a digression on Cilician piracy, Pergamon comes with a histor y
of the Attalids, his own residence in Alexandria allows him to offer an eye-witness
por trait of the late Hellenistic city, and ever ywhere local traditions are evoked,
whether through stories or monuments. Local traditions feature prominently too in
Pausanias' Description of Greece, a guidebook to ancient Greece written in the second
centur y A D . Detailed descriptions of sites and monuments are supplemented by
stories, historical and mythological, some widely-known, others local. Both Strabo
and Pausanias are valuable for giving a sense of the variety and complexity of the
Greek world; these are places inhabited and distinct rather than absorbed into a
streamlined narrative.
It is not only historical texts that will be discussed and cited in the chapters
that follow. Poetr y, scientific writings and philosophy can reveal much about
Hellenistic society, its ways of thinking, its values and its ideology. Poetr y has sur vived
rather better than histor y. There are the Idylls of Theocritus, the Argonautica of
Apollonios of Rhodes, the hymns of Callimachus, the mimes of Herodas, the enig
matic Alexandra of L ykophron, and the Phaenomena of Aratos of Soloi. Some
scientific writing sur vives, perhaps as it was less vulnerable to the vagaries of style:
the astronomical works of Aristarchos and Hipparchos, and the mathematical
writings of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonios of Perge. Philosophical texts fare
much worse. Apar t from Theophrastos' Characters and some philosophical letters
and maxims of Epicurus little now remains of the voluminous output of the
Hellenistic schools.

4 Inscriptions
In many cultures texts are written for public display; they may be epitaphs, dedica
tions, or advertisements; they may be inscribed on stone or bronze, pasted on
hoardings, or lit up in neon. Greek fondness for inscription is evident in the tens of
thousands of inscribed texts that sur vive from the cities of the Hellenistic East,
especially the cities of Asia Minor, but it is not the quantity that is distinctive so
much as the character of the texts themselves. Many of these are civic decrees, treaties
and letters from kings, in other words documents that were not primarily intended
for public display. The original text, written on a more manageable material such as
papyrus, would most likely have been kept in a city archive. Far from being shor t and
simple, these texts were frequently detailed and dense; for instance, a treaty between
Rhodes and the Cretan city of Hierapytna runs to over a hundred lines (SIG 3 581;
Austin 95), while almost two hundred lines remain of the incomplete decree
honouring Protogenes of Olbia on the Black Sea for ser vices to his native city
(SIG 3 495; Austin 97). Accumulatively documents such as these, edited and pub
lished by specialist scholars known as epigraphists, provide an invaluable resource for
the study of the Hellenistic world (for an example, Figure 19.1).
Such texts have an immediacy that a historical narrative, often composed much
later, does not have. It is not merely that they are contemporar y but that in reading
the text of an inscription we are faced with the par ticipants and their concerns in a
ver y direct way. Obscure cities come to life, both in their local preoccupations and
occasionally, more alarmingly, as they are drawn into the conflicts of the power ful.
The city of Teos on the coast of Asia Minor furnishes us with a good number of such
documents. Here we find inscribed the regulations for a school which has been
established with money donated by Polythros, a prominent local citizen; the teachers
will include a kithara-player to teach the children music and the school interestingly
provides for the education of both boys and girls (SIG 3 578; Austin 120). When
pirates occupy the harbour, the wealthy of Teos whose names are all inscribed
contribute to a fund to rid the city of the intruders and reclaim their captured
fellow-citizens (SEG 44.949). Antiochos III's take-over of the city prompts extensive
cult honours as it adjusts to the disappearance of Attalid power in the region
(Herrmann 1965a: 33±40; Ma 1999: nos. 17±18).
Only a selection of a city's public documents will ever have been inscribed and it is
wor th considering why some become civic monuments. If we look at the Teian texts
discussed above, it is evident that their content is varied ± education, piracy and royal
cult ± but in each case, directly or indirectly, someone is remembered and honoured
by the act of inscription, Polythros, the contributors, the king. This is not to suggest
that all inscription is honorific but in a culture in which the rich are expected to
per form ser vices for their city honour is highly prized and may consequently help to
shape our image of a city. It may even be the city itself which is honoured. An
impor tant verse inscription, recently discovered in Halikarnassos, begins by asking
`What is it that brings honour to Halikarnassos?'; the response, a fascinating insight
into civic pride and local tradition, outlines the city's mythical past before turning to
celebrate its poets and historians (Isager 1998; Lloyd-Jones 1999).
Approaching the Hellenistic World 9



The decision to inscribe is often contained within the document itself and may be
justified by reference to future obser vers; the permanence of a treaty can be repre
sented by engraving it on stone, thus the following clause negotiated between
Rhodes and Hierapytna:
And so that what was resolved about the alliance and the treaty might be engraved on
stone stelai and visible for all time, let the people (of Rhodes) set up a stele at Rhodes in
the sanctuar y of Athena, and let the poletai (of ficials responsible for letting state con
tracts) put out to tender a contract for making the stele out of Lar tian stone and for
engraving and erecting in the sanctuar y what was decided by the cities about the alliance,
as directed by the commissioner for works, at a cost of not more than 100 drachmas. Let
the treasurers pay for this expense out of the fund for matters to do with decrees. Let the
Hierapytnians also engrave the alliance and erect it among themselves in whatever
sanctuar y they think fit. (SIG 3
581.95±101; Austin 95)
Inscribed stones were both symbols of civic life and par t of the physical make-up of
the city. This is vividly demonstrated by the agora of Magnesia-on-the-Maeander.
Inscribed on the south and west walls of the city's central public space was an
impressive collection of over sixty decrees and royal letters from around the Greek
world. Magnesia had launched a major diplomatic campaign to ensure recognition of
its newly-established panhellenic festival of Ar temis Leukophr yene and these docu
ments, collected from the cities and kings visited by their ambassadors, were the
outcome. Here the aspirations of the city have become a physical presence within the
city (I.Magn. 16±87; Rigsby 1996: 179±279). The bulk of Hellenistic inscriptions
come from Greek cities and their sanctuaries, a striking testament to the vitality of
civic life in this period and a useful rejoinder to those who see Alexander as marking
the end of the polis.
5 Papyri
In 1900 the excavation of a cemeter y at Tebtynis in the Fayum area of Egypt
produced somewhat unexpected results. Workmen, hoping to find humans buried
with their most valued possessions, found instead dozens of mummified crocodiles,
carefully preser ved and interred by pious Egyptians. One of the men, uninhibited by a
sense of religious awe in the face of these sacred animals, gave vent to his fr ustration
by smashing up a crocodile with his spade. The rips in the mummy casing exposed
handwriting; waste papyri, in a form of papier mÃ ach Â e known as car tonnage, had been
moulded round the body of the animal (Bowman 1986: 173). This ancient practice,
developed for the mummification of both humans and sacred animals, has been a vital
source of papyr us texts for the Ptolemaic and the Augustan periods.
Papyrus was a writing material made from the Cyperus papyrus, a plant that grew in
the marshes and lakes of Egypt and especially in the Nile Delta. Outside Egypt it was
rare, giving the region a vir tual monopoly over papyr us production. Although used
for writing throughout the ancient world, it has sur vived best in Egypt, where it has
been found as car tonnage, in r ubbish dumps, and in the r uins of buildings. An
impor tant reason for its sur vival in Egypt is the climate; the dr y ground of the deser t
is ideal for its preser vation. There may, however, be other factors at work; although
10 Andrew Erskine



papyri have been found elsewhere, for example at Qumran near the Dead Sea, at
Dura-Europos on the Euphrates, and carbonized at Herculaneum in Italy, its avail
ability in Egypt may have meant that it was more readily used there than elsewhere
(Bagnall 1995: 26±9). Expense and distance from Egypt may have encouraged the
use of alternative materials, for instance the fragments of potter y known as ostraka or
wooden writing tablets such as those found at a rather later period at the Vindolanda
for t on Hadrian's Wall (Bowman 1994).
Like inscriptions papyri have a sense of immediacy, but whereas inscriptions of fer
the public, monolithic face of the city, monumentalized in stone, papyri take us closer
to the individual. The subject matter of the Egyptian papyri is varied: petitions,
private letters, deeds of sale, wills, marriage contracts, tax records, assor ted docu
ments from the state administration. Such documents will often sur vive without
context, but sometimes whole collections, linked together by an individual or a
place, have been discovered. Here it is possible to study the inter-relationships
between the documents as names, families, problems and themes recur, allowing
the creation of a context and a fuller picture of the world that produced the docu
ments. Two of the more impor tant collections, or archives as they tend to be known,
are the mid-third-centur y Zenon archive and the second-centur y texts from the
sanctuar y of Sarapis in Memphis. Zenon was the manager of a large estate at
Philadelphia in the Fayum, a property of Apollonios, chief minister of Ptolemy II.
This collection of some two thousand documents gives a remarkable insight into the
running of an estate, ranging from agricultural matters (where Zenon's approach is
fairly experimental), problems with tenants, both Greek and Egyptian, to dealings
with Apollonios and the state administration (Pestman 1981; Clar ysse and Vandorpe
1995). The much smaller archive of Ptolemaios, a man who spent about twenty years
of his life in seclusion in the Sarapeion at Memphis, has provided the focus for an
impor tant study of the interaction between Greek and Egyptian culture at the city
which had for centuries been considered its capital and which remained its religious
centre even after the cour t had moved to Alexandria (D. J. Thompson 1988:
212±65). Other archives allow similar studies (Lewis 1986).
Papyri offer a valuable point of access to the world of native Egyptians. Not only are
Egyptians a common presence in the Greek papyri that sur vive but there are also a
substantial number of documents written in a script of Egyptian known as demotic.
Especially in the early years of Ptolemaic rule Egyptians would often use demotic as
the appropriate language for contracts and other transactions among themselves,
though that gradually gave way to the language of the Greek rulers (D. J. Thompson
1994b). Papyri thus can make a significant contribution to modern debates about
culture and ethnicity in Egypt, revealing a complex society in which the ethnic
character of the individual, as expressed for instance in name and language, may
change according to context (Bagnall 1995: 20; D. J. Thompson 2001; Rowlandson,
this volume).
Abundant as the papyrological evidence is, there is also a need for the historian to
exercise a cer tain degree of caution. Alexandria and the Nile Delta were the most
populated regions of Egypt but the dampness of the soil has not favoured the sur vival
of papyri. Papyri tend to come from marginal areas where dr y conditions and lack of
later settlement have aided preser vation ± or from areas such as the Fayum where the
deser t has reclaimed the land. Nor is this material evenly spread out over time. This
Approaching the Hellenistic World 11



presents a problem for the historian: how safe is it to generalize from such evidence?
Can one extrapolate from one well-documented village to others? Can such local
Egyptian evidence illuminate the Hellenistic world beyond Egypt? It is impor tant to
be aware of such methodological problems but not to be paralyzed by them. The
careful and sensitive use of comparative material can do much to illuminate beyond
the immediate context (Bagnall 1995).
6 Other Voices
Alexander's conquest of the Persian empire brought a large number of dif ferent
cultures and peoples under Greco-Macedonian rule. The native voice, however, is
not so readily heard as its Greek counterpar t. This is par tly a problem of evidence;
there is less of it and, being in less well-known languages, it is not as accessible as
writings in the more familiar Greek and Latin. It may also, however, be a problem of
perspective; the ancient historian frequently comes to the Hellenistic world with a
classical training and sees Greek rule as the unifying factor. This can lead to an over
emphasis on Greekness and Greek culture. While much of the non-Greek population
may remain silent, some still speak to us, notably the Babylonians, the Egyptians and
the Jews.
Texts in Aramaic, a semitic language written in alphabetic script, are quite widely
dispersed, largely because of its role as one of the main languages of the now-defunct
Persian administration. For instance, when the Maur yan king Asoka sought to spread
the word of Buddha to the inhabitants of his Indian kingdom, the languages he chose
for his nor th-western territories were Aramaic and Greek, as is attested in a bilingual
inscription on a pillar from Kandahar in modern Afghanistan. This is not the only
bilingual text of Asoka in the region; Aramaic was also used in combination with
Prakrit, a language of India (Thapar 1997; MacDowell and Taddei 1978: 192±8). At
the other end of the former Persian empire Aramaic is to be found among the
languages used in Jewish writings, and features in the Dead Sea Scrolls of the Qumran
community, discovered in caves there in the 1940s and 1950s (Beyer 1984). Its
continuing impor tance in administration is demonstrated by its use in various bilin
gual Greek/Aramaic documents from Seleukid Babylonia (S. Sher win-White 1987:
23±5).
Jewish religion placed considerable emphasis on the written word; hence a large
amount of Jewish religious writing sur vives, notably the scriptures that go to make up
the Old Testament, mostly in Hebrew but with a little Aramaic. The demands of the
large Greek-speaking Jewish diaspora generated Greek translations of these scriptures
that together came to be known as the Septuagint, reputed to have been begun by a
team of seventy-two scholars working in Alexandria at the request of Ptolemy II. This
pressure for Greek texts is evident also in the first two books of Maccabees, both
impor tant sources for the histor y of the Jewish people in the second centur y. They
give two separate and var ying accounts of the circumstances and consequences of the
revolt of Judas Maccabaeus, the first written in Hebrew but translated into Greek, the
second composed in Greek, probably abridged from a more substantial work by a
cer tain Jason of Cyrene. Many of these Greek-speaking Jews would have lived in
Egypt, primarily but not only in Alexandria. The city of Herakleopolis along the Nile
valley, for example, has recently turned up an impor tant collection of Jewish papyri in
12 Andrew Erskine



Greek; the texts include petitions to the archon of the politeuma of the Jews, valuable
evidence for Jewish social organization in Egypt (Cowey and Maresch 2001).
In Egypt there was a large, native population, some of whose concerns, as was
noted in the previous section, have been unear thed on papyri in both demotic
Egyptian and in Greek. Papyrus preser ves not only the more ever yday aspects of
their life but also literature written in demotic. Narrative fiction, such as the adven
tures of Setna Khaemwase, or moral guidance, as in theInstructions of Ankhsheshonqy,
stand in a long Egyptian literar y tradition that goes back well before the Ptolemies
(Tait 1994; texts in Lichtheim 1980). But it was the priests and temples that were the
chief medium for the transmission of Egyptian tradition; here that tradition was
ar ticulated through the archaizing scripts of hieratic and hieroglyphic, scripts that
emphasized the priests' role as the keepers of arcane knowledge. Nonetheless, the
priests had a dual role; they connected the Egyptian people with their past but at the
same time they were at the inter face between the people and their Greek rulers. Their
decrees honouring the Ptolemaic kings would be inscribed in hieroglyph, demotic
and Greek, as for example the Kanopos decree and the famous Rosetta stone that
played such a crucial role in the modern decipherment of hieroglyphic script ( OGIS
56, 90; trans. Austin 222, 227). One priest, Manetho, even wrote a histor y of the
Pharaohs in Greek, thus presenting the Egyptian past to the Greek present. This,
unfor tunately, sur vives only through later writers.
Babylonia, too, had long, literate cultural traditions which continued through
Persian and into Seleukid rule. Again there is archaizing, evident in the use of
Akkadian, a language no longer spoken; it was written in cuneiform script, usually
formed by impressing the end of a reed into clay tablets. This language was the
preser ve of scholars, centred on temples, and finding expression in documents such as
chronicles, astronomical diaries, legal texts, administrative documents and horo
scopes. Such archaizing, far from being a sign of a moribund culture, is a sign of
the strength and resilience of Babylonian tradition under a series of foreign rulers.
The chronicles on the wars of the successors and on the early Seleukids, incomplete
though they are, give a valuable Babylonian perspective on the events of the time
(Grayson 1975a: nos. 10±13). As in Egypt, the temples may act as the custodians of
indigenous tradition but their of ficials can also address a Greek-speaking audience,
although by vir tue of using Greek they are altering their voice. Thus Berossos, a
Babylonian priest, produced the Babyloniaka, a histor y of Babylon in three books,
which now exists only in fragments; it is evident, even so, that it is shaped by the
principles of Greek historiography (FGrH 680; Burstein 1978; Kuhr t 1987).
However much our evidence may show an accommodation between the native
population and Greco-Macedonian intruders, there is one form of literature that
suggests an underlying resentment. From a number of par ts of this Hellenistic
world there were prophetic writings, exercises in wishful thinking, that often foretold
the overthrow and expulsion of foreign rulers, whether individuals or peoples. From
Babylon there is the Dynastic prophecy written in Akkadian; it is critical of Alexander
and seems to date from the period of the successors (S. Sher win-White 1987: 10±14).
The apocalyptic Book of Daniel, written in Hebrew and Aramaic around the time of
the Maccabaean revolt, culminates by dramatically prophesying the end of contem
porar y empires and the emergence of the kingdom of God. Out of Egypt come the
Demotic Chronicle and the Oracle of the Potter; the latter, a Greek translation from
Approaching the Hellenistic World 13



the Egyptian, foretells the abandonment of Greek Alexandria and revival of the
traditional capital of Memphis (A. B. Lloyd 1982; Koenen 1968; Burstein 106).
Just as the non-Greek population and their priests could express themselves in the
language of the r ulers, so the Greek kings could adopt a native voice. An inscribed
foundation cylinder from a temple in Babylonian Borsippa allows Antiochos I to
speak in Akkadian and impor tantly in the manner of a native king (Kuhr t and
Sher win-White 1991). In Egypt royal decrees were sometimes translated into dem
otic and may today sur vive only in demotic (cf. Burstein 97). The visual equivalent of
this is the way in which por traits of Ptolemy I and his successors show these kings as
Pharaohs (figure 7.2), a striking expression of the complex and multifaceted character
of Alexander's legacy.

CHAPTER TWO
After Alexander:
the Emergence of the
Hellenistic World, 323±281
David Braund
Alexander the Great has become such an enormous figure that he tends easily to
overshadow ever yone and ever ything around him. His coruscating campaign through
Asia Minor and Iran to Afghanistan and the Indian sub-continent forcibly carried
Hellenic culture beyond the wildest imaginings of earlier Greek imperialists. At the
climax of his success, at Babylon in 323 B C , he died, romantically young, ensuring the
power of his legend in centuries to come, tinged and enhanced with human frailties.
However, just as Alexander's spectacular father, Philip II, suffers in his great shadow,
so the aftermath of the imperialist adventure may seem at first sight to have been ver y
much an anti-climax.
Alexander had left his world with no par ticular direction. Death had not been
expected; in any case his supercharged romance had little time for responsibility. The
world he left behind had been changed fundamentally, but what sor t of `new world
order' was to follow? In 323 B C no-one knew, except, as legend had it, Alexander
himself, who predicted war with his dying breath (Diod. 18.1.4; Arr.Anab. 7. 26.3;
Cur t. 10.5.5; Just. 12.15.6±8). There were relations of Alexander for whom claims to
power might be made, but none was even nearly ready to fill his shoes: his only
recognized son was still in Roxane's womb. There were also his generals, at various
ages and stages in their careers and with large numbers of men under arms or available
for war. Women too would play key roles: such is the habit of monarchies. What kind
of succession could there be? The throne of Macedon itself had tended to change
hands in bloody fashion, so that war and murder were to be expected. Now the prize
was far more extensive and diverse. Alexander's campaign had cut so great a swathe
through the empire of Achaimenid Persia that he had ef fectively replaced the Persian
king while also remaining king of Macedon and master of Greece. And yet much of
the Achaimenid Empire had not really been conquered at all: Cappadocia was held by
an Ariarathes. Caucasia had been passed by, though par t of the Achaimenid sphere
(Braund 1994; Knauss 2001). Eastern limits were negotiable and to be disputed
(Schober 1984; Boswor th 1996; Holt 1999). It was most unclear that a single man

would be able to emerge from the flur r y of competi tors to seize for himself the whol e
prize in all its scale and dive rsity . It was still less clear that any such success could be
stabi lized in the longer ter m: Alexande r hims elf had not managed that befor e his
death.
For more than for ty years, from 323 to 281, these issues were foug ht out across a
huge exp anse of ter ritor y , entailing Greece , Asia Mino r, the Mediter ranean Sea ,
Egypt, C entral A sia, Iran and India. T he extende d conf lict was marked by recur rent
allian ces an d `Pe aces' between some or most of the leadi ng playe rs, rem inding us that
diplom acy was as impor tant as actua l figh ting. These ar rang ements, howeve r much
couche d in the languag e of establishe d har mony , were made to be put to use or
broken. Accordingly , for the mod er n student of the period the sense of anti- climax
after 323 may be made to seem still more depressin g by the fragm ented compl exities
of num erous indiv iduals, a dizzying scatter of places and a whirlwin d of event s which
seem all too ofte n to come to noth ing. The absence of a single ancie nt nar rative ± a
Thucyd ides, say ± to select what matters, to gi ve a dom inant interp retatio n and to
guide us through the tangle does noth ing to raise fa ltering spiri ts. Inst ead our
princip al sour ce is Diodo ros , Books 18±20, much of whi ch seems to come from
Hiero nymos of Kardia, who was a par ticipant in some o f the events describe d and
who knew leadi ng figur es (Hor nblow er 19 81).
How ever, whi le Alexande r's long shadow is not to be denied (and is wor th
conside ration in its own right: Stewar t 1993a), the years 323±281 have a lot to
of fer even so, c onveyed to us by a rang e of ancie nt voices and material evidenc e,
neithe r simply Gre ek (Erski ne, this volume ). Th ese years show fi rst the consequ ences
of the great impe rialist adventu re in a worl d whi ch, from a Gre ek pers pective at least ,
had now exp anded massiv ely , however much some Gre eks had penetr ated eastwards
before Alexand er's campai gn. From the morass of competi tion, really major figures
do emerge, most nota bly Antigon os Mono phthalmos (`the One-Ey ed') unti l his
death in 301, Seleuko s I unti l his death in 281 and the judici ous Ptolemy , who
died in 283. The exp anded world was car ved up between the more successful
compe titors aga in and aga in, leav ing challe nging pol itical shap es on the map, to
geth er with the abidin g noti on of potentia l unification . More over, it is in these yea rs
that mon archy re- emerges as the dom inant for m in Greek histor y , afte r a marked
hiatus , with its ro ots both in Mace donian a nd in local practice s. The Hell enistic world
which Alexande r had instiga ted was to be a worl d with great cities ± includ ing his own
foundat ions ± but it was above all to be a worl d of kings. Per haps most excit ing and
yet most elusi ve is the rich cu ltural mix that develope d (and not without contro versy)
in the after mat h of Alexande r . It is most visible, as ever, amon g the r uling elite.
Meanw hile, as for the more humble, the over whelm ing majority , we are nonplussed
through the haz iness and the diver sity of local stories playe d out in the ver y many
micr ocosms of this exten sive world, just visib le in the archaeo logical record (Alcock
1994; cf. Shiple y 2000). In shor t, eve r ything was possi ble in 323, except a peacefu l
successio n.
1 Babylon and Triparadeisos: from Perdikkas to Antipater
Perdikkas was the firs t to achie ve pre -eminen ce in the af ter math of Alexande r's deat h.
He had bee n the closest of his fri ends in 323, and he was on the spot, in Babylon, to
The Emergence of the Hellenistic World, 323±281 21



manage matters (on the progress of events, Errington 1970). It was said that
Alexander had given him his signet-ring, symbolic of his wishes, which Perdikkas
claimed to champion. The Macedonian army, in assembly to consider the future,
of fered Perdikkas the kingship, but he demurred. Our key source here, Quintus
Cur tius Rufus of the first half of the first centur y A D , may well have inser ted an
echo of the posturings of early Roman emperors, especially Tiberius inA D 14 (Cur t.
10.6; Badian 1962; Boswor th 1971: 128). His whole stance as the guardian of
Alexander's interests required hesitation, for Alexander's widow was pregnant and
might produce a son and heir. As Alexander's champion Perdikkas could hardly seize
the throne from the king's son: much better to be regent, if there were to be a son.
And so he waited. Meanwhile, the claims of Herakles, the son of Iranian Barsine and
said to be Alexander's, were rejected fiercely: Alexander had not acknowledged his
paternity. The impor tance of Alexander's blood, where it could be proved, is con
firmed by the emergence of his half-brother Philip Arrhidaios, who was acclaimed by
the army as Perdikkas hesitated. Philip Arrhidaios, we are told, was mentally disabled:
some blamed Olympias, in the fog of propaganda surrounding the succession-crisis
(on which Boswor th 1971). But, however much disabled, Philip Arrhidaios was
Alexander's half-brother even so; and he was on the spot at Babylon, available for
use by others (Diod. 18.2; Plut. Alex. 77; cf. Athen. 13.557d). However, kingship
had not been the only option touted. Ptolemy had suggested that Alexander's friends
might rule as a council; that would have undermined Perdikkas' predominance.
A cer tain Meleagros, characterized as the worst of demagogues (a simplification at
best: Heckel 1992: 165±70), had urged the army to seize a heritage that was really its
own, causing a riot, until changing his position to suppor t for Arrhidaios.
While the army had the strength, the friends of Alexander were well placed to
manipulate and ultimately control it. Meleagros was a nuisance to them and was
murdered; a solution could be achieved. Perdikkas avoided the kingship but took `the
care of the whole kingdom', on behalf of Alexander's new-born son and no doubt
Arrhidaios too. The technicalities of his uncer tain titulature need not detain us
(Boswor th 1971: 131±2; Billows 1990: 54±7; Heckel 1992: 366±70). More impor t
ant, two key figures were absent from these crucial events at Babylon: Antipater and
Krateros. Antipater had been holding Macedon and thus Greece for Alexander ever
since the latter had left for Asia in 334; he was still there, though Alexander had set
about his removal (encouraging rumours that he had killed Alexander, no less: Bos
wor th 1971). For Krateros had been sent to replace him, though he was proceeding
with no great urgency. While Perdikkas secured his pre-eminence in Babylon, Kra
teros was still in Cilicia, vaguely en route to Macedon, his awkward task now still more
unattractive.
Neither Antipater nor Krateros could be forgotten even at Babylon. They were
invited, in their absence, to share power in Macedon and Greece. Key satrapies of
Alexander's empire were parcelled out to the others who mattered. Ptolemy got
Egypt, L ysimachos Thrace, Leonnatos Hellespontine Phr ygia, and Antigonos Mono
phthalmos Greater Phr ygia. Cappadocia and Paphlagonia were to be conquered by
Leonnatos and Antigonos and then handed to Eumenes of Kardia. Perdikkas himself
was careful to have the army-assembly reject, on grounds of practicality, the grand
schemes envisaged by Alexander, especially in the west. Roxane's baby son, however,
was enthusiastically acclaimed; this was Alexander IV.
22 David Braund



However, the settlement was illusor y in large par t. There were major loose ends. In
Greece, Athens and the Aitolians in par ticular saw in Alexander's death the oppor
tunity for revolt (Habicht 1997). This was the so-called Lamian War: Antipater was
besieged in Lamia in Thessaly, until Leonnatos' inter vention from Phr ygia broke the
opposition at the cost of his own life. Meanwhile Antipater, doubtless disgruntled
through his absence from Babylon, had entered negotiations not only with Leonna
tos but also with Ptolemy (who had tried to undermine Perdikkas at Babylon) and
with Alexander's power ful mother, Olympias. Meanwhile, in summer 322 Krateros
finally reached Macedon, but he accepted Antipater's seniority and command. Athens
was seized, after losing the Battle of Krannon: a Macedonian garrison was installed at
Munychia, dominating the por t at Piraeus (Green 1990: 36±8, captures the mood).
Antipater gave his daughter Phila in marriage to Krateros, cementing their relation
ship, while another daughter, Nikaia, was sent to Perdikkas, evidently in the hope of a
rapprochement, though Perdikkas himself was apparently inciting Greek opposition
to Antipater (Diod. 18.48.2). Indeed, Perdikkas declared his hand by rejecting Nikaia
and instead marr ying Kleopatra, who was no less than the sister of Alexander and had
been sent to Asia by Olympias. Meanwhile, Antigonos Monophthalmos fled to
Antipater and Krateros: he had left the task of conquering Cappadocia to Perdikkas
and could expect retribution. It has been plausibly suggested that he was less than
happy with the outcome at Babylon (Billows 1990: 56±7).
Ptolemy remained aligned with Antipater's coalition, at a careful distance. By his
good for tune, Alexander had expressed the wish that his body be deposited at Siwa:
its possession could only be talismanic. Accordingly, in 321 Ptolemy attacked the
Perdikkan force escor ting it in Syria and brought it forcibly to Egypt, where he
deposited it at Memphis. Early in 320 Perdikkas invaded Egypt to recover the
body, but fared badly until he was killed by his own of ficers, led by Peithon, satrap
of Media, notably abetted by the young Seleukos (Erskine 2002a). Meanwhile, there
had been fighting in the nor th, where Eumenes defended the Hellespont with mixed
success against Antipater and Krateros. While Krateros was killed, Antipater branded
Eumenes a Greek rebel who was to be executed (Errington 1970: 67).
Within a few years of Alexander's death, his forces had gone to war with each other
and his two favoured friends ± Perdikkas and Krateros ± were dead. A new arrange
ment was needed, reached at Triparadeisos in nor thern Syria in 320. The key question
was how to replace Perdikkas, within a broader new scheme. Antipater was the
obvious choice, but preferred to avoid the role: Perdikkas' fate was doubtless a
warning, while the army was restless for lack of pay and incited to action, we are
told, by Eur ydike, the wife of Philip Arrhidaios. Antipater may also have felt his age:
he was already in his seventies. With Ptolemy ensconced in Egypt, Antigonos Mono
phthalmos, already satrap of Greater Phr ygia, was given control of Asia and the task of
dealing with Eumenes. Antipater's main ambition seems to have been to retain his
dominance in Macedon, but he was careful to have his son Kassandros as Antigonos'
second-in-command, while his daughter Phila, now a widow after the death of
Krateros, married Antigonos' son, Demetrios. Triparadeisos doubtless left Antipater
feeling in control: Kassandros could be expected to keep watch over the principal
threat to his supremacy, Antigonos. Triparadeisos had also brought Seleukos, hith
er to a cavalr y-commander, to a new prominence: he was given Babylonia. Alexander's
shaky empire had not quite fragmented, for Antipater could plausibly imagine himself
The Emergence of the Hellenistic World, 323±281 23



at its head. But the process of fragmentation was ver y far advanced for all that and
Antipater's death would soon be a fur ther step. Throughout, Macedonians domin
ated the struggle; only the Greek Eumenes was a significant exception. By contrast,
Iranians played no par t in the forefront of these power-politics; even the Iranian wives
assigned by Alexander had in par t been set aside. However, that tendency can be
exaggerated (S. Sher win-White 1987: 6±7; cer tainly Seleukos kept his, Apame). We
should not neglect the presence of non-Greeks in impor tant administrative and
militar y roles not far beneath the great Macedonians: occasional inscriptions in
par ticular of fer salutar y examples of such figures in Asia and Egypt (Briant 1985;
Billows 1990: 310±11; Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 121±5).
2 Antigonos the King
Antipater returned from Triparadeisos to Macedon with `the kings', as they could be
grandly termed, that is the disabled Philip Arrhidaios (alias Philip III) and Roxane's
son, Alexander IV, scarcely more than a toddler. Their possession confirmed his pre
eminence, but his age was against him and the new arrangements: his death in 319
decapitated the structure agreed at Triparadeisos. To take his place he himself, on his
death-bed, had appointed Polyperchon, who no doubt seemed a safe pair of hands,
but who was to show himself unequal to the enormous task, whether or not the
sources give an unfairly hostile picture of him, as seems likely (Hornblower 1981:
224±5). In a bid to bolster his new authority, presumably, Polyperchon took the
dangerous step of recalling Olympias from exile in Epeiros: on an optimistic view, an
association with Alexander's mother as well as `the kings' gave Polyperchon all the
cards (Billows 1990: 84). But Antipater had (curiously perhaps) passed over his own
energetic son, Kassandros, who went in search of allies against Polyperchon. Kassan
dros had already figured in the arrangements around Triparadeisos in a way in which
Polyperchon had not: Antigonos, Ptolemy and L ysimachos gave him their suppor t.
After all why should they accept Polyperchon in Antipater's position? He was no
Antipater.
For his par t, Polyperchon attracted Eumenes, whose condemnation to death was
overlooked. Antigonos had not long ago reached his own agreement with Eumenes,
which had allowed Eumenes to escape the fastness of Nora in the nor thern Tauros,
where Antigonos had been besieging him in 319/18. Antigonos too had overlooked
Eumenes' condemnation. Legalistic niceties were malleable, as the moment required,
and in any case were open to dispute. Warfare was renewed: while Polyperchon
fought in Greece, Eumenes resumed hostilities with Antigonos in Asia, claiming the
suppor t of the dead Alexander, who, he said, had appeared to him in a dream.
Alexander's name was still a potent force (Diod. 18.60±2; Billows 1990: 85). In
Macedon in 317 Eur ydike, Philip Arrhidaios' wife, declared for Kassandros, fractur
ing the foundation of Polyperchon's position as guardian of `the kings'. Olympias
reacted violently: the two women met at the head of their respective armies on
the borders of Epeiros and Macedonia. But Eur ydike's forces would not fight:
Olympias was Alexander's mother. In victor y and with Polyperchon's suppor t she
swiftly executed Philip Arrhidaios and forced Eur ydike to suicide, as Alexander
himself might well have done (Athen. 13.560f from Douris of Samos; cf. Bosworth
1971).
24 David Braund



She soon paid the price: Kassandros executed her in turn early in 315, having
forced his way into Macedonia and star ved her out of her retreat in Pydna. Poly
perchon sought refuge in the Peloponnese, where he maintained hostilities. How
ever, Kassandros enjoyed the greater popularity among the Greek cities: at Athens, in
par ticular, Demetrios of Phaleron was presiding on his behalf from about 317 and
over the next ten years would be honoured with no less than 300 statues, we are told,
which at least indicates Athenians' desire to curr y favour (Parker 1996: 258). Now,
with Philip Arrhidaios, Eur ydike and Olympias all done to death, the child-`king'
Alexander IV gained a singular impor tance. Kassandros now had him. He kept the
boy under guard with Roxane at Amphipolis, while in 315 he married a sister of
Alexander the Great, Thessalonike. The direction of his ambitions was clear enough.
In Asia, meanwhile, Eumenes had also died, executed by Antigonos at the ver y
beginning of 315. Having appropriated the royal treasur y at Susa, Eumenes had
inflicted significant losses upon Antigonos' forces at the Battle of Paraitakene in
316 and all but won the Battle of Gabiene at the turn of the same year, save that
Antigonos had gained the crucial prize of Eumenes' baggage-train, women and all.
That was enough for the elite Macedonian infantr y, who exchanged Eumenes for
their baggage: by that means Antigonos emerged victorious, as his ally Kassandros
had prospered also in Europe.
However, Antigonos seems to have been too eager to enforce his authority.
Seleukos in par ticular refused to accept it: we are told that he insisted that he owed
his satrapy not to Antigonos but to the ser vices he had per formed for Alexander,
having been awarded it at Triparadeisos. Wisely, he then fled to Ptolemy in Egypt,
who received him with generosity and enthusiasm: Seleukos is said to have told
Ptolemy that Antigonos wanted `the whole kingdom of the Macedonians'; that is,
to take the place vacated by Alexander (Diod. 19.55±6). Ptolemy and Seleukos
therefore recruited Kassandros and L ysimachos to test Antigonos' ambitions by
claiming some of his territories and shares of the booty he had taken from Eumenes.
In response, Antigonos prepared for war, sending help to his erstwhile enemy Poly
perchon in the Peloponnese to prosecute his rumbling war against Kassandros.
However, the ensuing conflict is most notable for its high-energy diplomacy: past
friends had become enemies, but might hope to become friends again in pursuit of
their own interests. The search for suppor t also entailed the many cities. It is in this
context that we find the glimmer of an ideal amongst the power-hungr y machinations
of ambitious individualists: the so-called `proclamation of Tyre'. For in 314, be
sieging Ptolemy's forces in Tyre, Antigonos called a militar y assembly at which he
denounced Kassandros for killing Olympias, holding Alexander IV and Roxane,
forcing (allegedly) Thessalonike to marr y him and, by these acts, showing his ambi
tions to rule the Macedonians. Fur ther he added that Kassandros had acted against
Macedonian interests by restoring the hated Olynthians to their city, re-established in
his own name (Kassandreia), and by re-building Thebes, which Alexander had razed.
Antigonos decreed that Kassandros must either undo these wrongs and acknowledge
him as his superior and the guardian of Alexander IV, or become an enemy. And
finally, he decreed that all the Greeks (that is, the Greek cities) should be free,
ungarrisoned and live under their own laws. All this was a bid for suppor t: Antigonos
hoped that the Greek cities would embrace the prospect of freedom and resist
Kassandros in par ticular. However, the discourse of freedom for Greeks had been
The Emergence of the Hellenistic World, 323±281 25



heard often enough since the fifth centur y to warn all but the most gullible. In 386
the King's Peace had used such talk of freedom to make Greece subject to Persia and
its Spar tan allies. And the invocation of freedom for Greeks remained a commonplace
of public posturing well after Antigonos too, used even by the Romans. The ver y
notion tends to tautology: he who gives such freedom thereby suggests his power to
take it away at will and thereby underlines his implied master y. Yet, hollow or not,
Ptolemy thought it as well to counter Antigonos' self-presentation as champion of
Greek freedom: he too promised freedom to the Greeks.
Throughout, our predominantly Greek sources lay par ticular emphasis on Greek
perspectives, including such appeals for Greek backing. The fact that all the major
players in these power-politics were Macedonian (or at least Greek) strengthens that
tendency still fur ther. Reasonably so, perhaps. But we should not lose sight of the fact
that these would-be rulers needed to maximize their suppor t in a shifting and
dangerous world: that meant serious attention to the aspirations of non-Greek elites
and non-Greek troops. Eumenes had worked to build suppor t among the Cappado
cians (Plut. Eum. 4; S. Sher win-White 1987: 15); better attested, thanks to Babylon
ian evidence, are Seleukos' constructive dealings with the non-Greeks of Babylon.
Seleukos had taken care to build strong personal relationships with the elite of
Babylon and had earned their favour by so doing. In sharp contrast, Antigonos was
to prefer extreme violence against them and their property, making his own position
there harder to maintain (Diod. 19.91; Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 8±10). Non
Greeks too had par ts to play, which no Macedonian could af ford to ignore.
In winter 312/11 the Battle of Gaza brought Antigonos down to ear th (on the
date, Billows 1990: 134 n. 67): Ptolemy and Seleukos inflicted a defeat upon his son,
Demetrios. Diplomacy now suited most: in summer 311 a peace was concluded once
more. Kassandros was declared general of Europe until Alexander IV reached matur
ity. L ysimachos was to retain Thrace; Ptolemy would keep Egypt, as well as the cities
he had brought under his sway in Cyrenaica to the west and Arabia to the east.
Antigonos himself would have the whole of Asia, while the Greeks should be autono
mous. There is a notable absence from these arrangements: no mention is made of
Seleukos. Perhaps Ptolemy had thought it best to abandon him, or at least to agree to
his omission; conceivably, Seleukos had already directed his energies to Central Asia
and made it easier for others to overlook him (Diod. 19.105 with Simpson 1954;
Austin 1981: 57; Will 1984: 50; Billows 1990: 134).
We are for tunate in having Antigonos' gloss on the agreement in the form in which
he presented it in a letter to the city of Skepsis in the Troad and doubtless to other
cities besides. Skepsis inscribed his letter and, to show its joy, developed its festival in
his honour into a cult, with precinct, altar and cult-statue. In his letter Antigonos lays
emphasis on the freedom of the Greeks, as might be expected, but even in so doing
his injunction upon them to swear suppor t for the agreement, evidently in conjunc
tion with other cities, immediately indicates the severe limitations upon that freedom
(OGIS 5, trans. Austin 31). It is easy enough to see why the people of Skepsis thought
it best to flaunt their joy and their gratitude (OGIS 6, trans. Austin 32). It is easy also
to see why Antigonos persisted in his noisy suppor t for Greek freedom: that sounded
much better than any reference to defeat at Gaza or to the substantial compromise
that the peace of 311 meant for him by contrast with his bullish proclamation at Tyre
(Will 1984: 51±2, splendidly cynical).
26 David Braund



At the same time, the peace of 311 indicates the growing problem of Alexander IV
for Kassandros, and by extension also for Antigonos and the others. Alexander IV was
entering his teenage years; already we are told there were murmurings that he should
be given power. In theor y at least the realm of Alexander the Great might even now
be passed en bloc to a son and heir. Kassandros took the obvious and brutal step: he
had him murdered, together with Roxane. Now there were only Alexander's sisters,
Kleopatra and Thessalonike (Kassandros' wife), and (arguably) the young Herakles,
Barsine's son, whose claim had been rejected at Babylon but who had lived on at
Pergamon, evidently nur tured by Antigonos, just in case.
Kassandros' rivals were tellingly silent about the murder of `the king', Alexander
the Great's son. Roxane mattered much less in that, although Alexander's widow, she
was an outsider, an Iranian, and a woman to boot. Kassandros will have blamed others
for the killings, but implausibly, for Roxane and her boy were in his custody.
However, while we may assume disquiet elsewhere (Billows 1990: 141 on the
army; cf. Austin 1986), Kassandros' rivals seem to have made nothing of it (Diod.
19.105 with Gruen 1985: 253± 4). Even Antigonos, who had made so much of
Kassandros' mistreatment of Alexander IV and Roxane outside Tyre, seems not to
have levelled the obvious criticism at him now. All had reason to be pleased that the
inconvenience of Alexander the Great's son and heir had been removed. But that did
not preclude them, had they wished, from now stressing their loyalty to `the king' and
denouncing Kassandros even so: hypocrisy was not a problem and protestations of
loyalty were easier with `the king' safely dead. Perhaps there was criticism, not
preser ved in our fractured sources; perhaps the killings had been agreed in advance
and the agreement kept for once.
Indeed, one wonders how far the news was bruited abroad; there is a sense of
secrecy and even denial surrounding the death of Alexander the Great's heir. It is
star tling to find that the regnal year of Alexander IV continues to be used for dating
purposes well after his death: in Egypt we find two demotic documents dated in that
way as late as 305/4 B C (P. Dem. Louvre 2427, 2440, with Gruen 1985: 258, esp. n.
30). His death raised an enormous question for which there was not yet an answer.
All the events and posturings of the previous decade and more had taken place in the
context of the notional rule of `the king', or while Philip Arrhidaios was alive `the
kings'. This was not an issue of legal nicety or any kind of constitutional rule-book,
but a whole world-view, which gave meaning to the claims and actions of the leading
players. The proclamation at Tyre and the agreement of 311 are enough to show that
all pre-eminence was still imagined as deriving from Alexander the Great's son.
Accordingly, the murder of Alexander IV set a large question mark beside the
positions of the leading men: for whom were they acting? Of course at the level of
power-politics the answer was the same as it had been since the tumultuous debates at
Babylon in 323: those in power were acting for themselves. However, it was not
immediately clear that such an answer, though realistic, was entirely suf ficient. There
was something to be gained by not making much of the death of Alexander IV: the
status quo could hold while new stances were worked out and adopted.
It was only after four years, in 306, that Antigonos Monophthalmos finally took
the step of calling himself `king', and also bestowing the title on his own son and heir,
Demetrios. The inter vening years after 310 were spent in tension and low-level
conflicts. In 309 the hopeful Herakles had finally been done away with. Polyperchon
The Emergence of the Hellenistic World, 323±281 27



had tried to use him against Kassandros: they came to terms, which brought Poly
perchon the return of his property in Macedonia and a place in Kassandros' hierarchy
as general of the Peloponnese at the price of Herakles' murder. Hencefor th Poly
perchon lived on in this relative obscurity, outliving both Kassandros and Antigonos,
from whom he had received Herakles and no doubt encouragement to use him
(Billows 1990: 140±3).
In these years also Ptolemy had gone on the of fensive, pursuing ambitions not only
in the Eastern Mediterranean but into the Aegean too. He promoted himself, once
again, as the champion of Greek freedom, especially (as before) against Antigonos,
whom he held to have broken the conditions of the peace of 311 in that regard.
Moreover, he sought to marr y Kleopatra, sister of Alexander the Great and almost the
last living link to his legend: Antigonos had held her at Sardis since 321. Meanwhile,
he was making over tures to Polemaios, Antigonos' disaf fected nephew who had
car ved out a strong position for himself in central Greece: initial co-operation on
Kos was soon ended by Ptolemy's decision to kill this awkward new ally, who seemed
not to know his place. To exploit his death Ptolemy set about establishing himself in
Corinth and Sikyon, with much talk of Greek freedom: a lukewarm Peloponnesian
response caused him to limit his schemes, place garrisons in his two cities, and return
to Egypt after coming to an arrangement with Kassandros (cf. Billows 1990: 145 n.
18 envisaging a restored League of Corinth). Meanwhile, dealings with Kleopatra had
also begun well and finished badly for Ptolemy. Wooed by all the leading players on
account of her lineage, Kleopatra plumped for Ptolemy in 309/8 but was caught on
her way to him and murdered by some of her women, evidently at Antigonos'
surreptitious behest (Diod. 20.37; on her grand marital histor y, Billows 1990: 143
n. 15). Ptolemy returned alone, but he had shown the scope of his ambitions, which
encompassed far more than Egypt and its environs.
In Asia proper, Seleukos had been engrossed well to the east of Babylonia, in the
so-called Upper Satrapies of Central Asia, while Antigonos' son Demetrios seized and
ravaged Babylonia in his absence. After returning to defeat Antigonos, as it seems (we
rely on Polyaen. 4.9), Seleukos made a pact with him in 308, which allowed him to
spend the next five years building his realms in the east, especially against the Indian
ruler Chandragupta (alias Sandrokottos: see Holt 1999, esp. 28). That allowed
Antigonos to turn his full attention on the west: he sent his favourite son, the
energetic Demetrios, to take Athens away from his namesake, Demetrios of Phaleron,
the philosopher and friend of Kassandros.
With a mixture of militar y acuity and adroit proclamation of the liberation of
Athens and restoration of the ancestral constitution, Antigonos' son swiftly took
the city, while Demetrios of Phaleron retired to Thebes. Kassandros had been
occupied in a fruitless campaign in Epeiros. The Athenians responded to the Anti
gonid regime with a string of extravagant honours, associating Antigonos and his son
with the gods: for what it is wor th, the biographer Plutarch considered this to be the
cause of Demetrios' later obnoxious behaviour (Demetr. 8±10; Austin 34; Parker
1996: 258±9, adducing SEG 30.69). Athens was now a democracy once more, but
ver y much under Antigonid control. Demetrios next took Megara and in winter
307/6 set about organizing Greek cities against Kassandros, before setting of f to
engage Ptolemy in Cyprus; its position had already made it a major bone of conten
tion. In 306, with bravura tactics once more, Demetrios crushed the Ptolemaic forces
28 David Braund



on Cyprus, winning a key naval victor y of f Salamis on the east of the island; Athenian
ships played a distinguished par t. Cyprus now belonged to Antigonos and would
remain in Antigonid hands for more than a decade to come (Billows 1990: 151±5).
This was the moment at which Antigonos became king in 306. Our sources relate
the theatrical arrival of an envoy from Demetrios, discreetly repor ting the great
victor y to Antigonos, who was busy building his new capital, Antigoneia-on-the
Orontes, in nor thern Syria near the site of the later city of Antioch (on its location,
Diod. 20.47 with Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 11). The envoy (Aristodemos, a
well-established ser vant), after a stately progress to Antigonos' presence, finally gave
his repor t. His first words were stunning: `Hail, King Antigonos!' Immediately a
diadem was produced and bestowed upon Antigonos by his entourage; King Anti
gonos then sent another diadem to Demetrios with a letter addressing him too as
king.
The theatricality was appropriate to the dramatic event: for the first time since 323
there was now a king who could rule for himself and over an extensive realm, after
some seventeen years of bloody conflict and shifting diplomacy (Plut.
D emetr
. 17±18;
Gruen 1985, esp. 255). Less clear is the extent to which the play was actually staged
by Antigonos or written up thereafter for public consumption: our fullest account,
Plutarch in his
Life
of Demetrios, is well-known for his penchant for drama in his
Lives
and in this
Life
in par ticular (DeLacy 1952 remains the classic study). However
that may be, it is clear enough that Antigonos' assumption of the royal title followed
hard upon the (unusually clear-cut and substantial) victor y in Cyprus; given that the
essence of kingship was militar y victor y, the logic was impeccable. Demetrios' king
ship was thus not only convenient for the succession to ageing Antigonos, but also
was seen to be deser ved. That Antigonos appears at this critical moment also as a
builder of cities fur ther confirms his proper claim to royalty: to build cities was itself
appropriate to a king (Shipley 2000: 59±86 and the works cited there). However, the
par ticular power of the dramatic stor y of his acquisition of the title resides in the
initiative coming not from Antigonos but from others, most immediately his entou
rage, but also the army on Cyprus which had sent Aristodemos to make his statement.
To be king was a personal matter: the title moved with the king, unrestricted by any
territorial associations. Antigonos, and by his grace Demetrios, were kings, but it
remained to be seen what they would rule. In their wilder dreams they no doubt
envisaged Alexander the Great's realm.
The impor tance of these events is not to be diminished. And yet some perspective is
required: it is all to easy to be beguiled by grandeur. None of Antigonos' rivals rushed
to assume a royal title for themselves: documentar y evidence shows that both Ptol
emy and Seleukos waited until the first half of 304. As to L ysimachos, 304 is likely
enough, but we simply do not know. Kassandros seems to have waited longer still,
perhaps until 302 (Gruen 1985). Their delay demands explanation. On the other
hand, the royal title had been bandied about even before 306. The debates of 323
apar t, we are told that Seleukos had spor ted it when dealing with non-Greeks (Plut.
Demet r . 18
) and also claimed to have been hailed as king by the oracle of Apollo near
Miletos before setting out to Babylonia in 312 (Diod. 19.90.4). Moreover, Athenian
honours for Antigonos and Demetrios in 307 had included the bestowal of the royal
title upon them: little enough for the divine (Plut.
Demetr
. 10; cf. above). There were
no rules for the assumption of kingship. The sheer power of those who followed

29



Alexander could only attract the title, for royalty was central to the discourse of
power, while the death of Alexander IV in par ticular encouraged the use of the title.
While subjects eager to express their loyalty might well prof fer kingship, it was for the
leaders to decide whether and when to accept it. In 306 Antigonos considered the
moment right, buoyed by victor y, and no doubt incited the of fer. The others could
afford to await reactions, and hope perhaps to turn Antigonos' striking gambit to
their own diplomatic advantage; their powers were not immediately affected. Once
they had seen Antigonos' innovation accepted, they followed his example and chose
their moments as best they could to do so. In making their respective moves, there is
no reason to suppose that Kassandros, Seleukos, Ptolemy and L ysimachos each had
any less ambition than Antigonos or one another (pace Will 1984: 57±8). Each may
well have had dreams of becoming the new Alexander. After all Antigonos was already
76 years of age and would soon create a vacancy which the bold Demetrios might not
be able to fill for long.
3 From the Siege of Rhodes to the Battle of Ipsos
Be that as it may, King Antigonos was still seeking to expand his realm: while
Antigonos failed to press home his advantage over Ptolemy (Billows 1990: 162±5),
Rhodes was the next objective for Demetrios. The Rhodians had declined Demetrios'
invitation to join in the campaign against Cyprus, preferring to continue to hedge
their bets, and winning Antigonid enmity in the process (Diod. 20.46.6). Rhodian
sea-power and Rhodes' strategic location between the Aegean and the eastern Medi
terranean were enough to attract hostile action (cf. Ber thold 1984). Demetrios was
sent to take the island and set about a siege which was to earn him the familiar name
`Poliorketes' (`Besieger'). After a year or more, from 305 into 304, and despite the
deployment of a panoply of innovative technology, the exasperated Antigonos called
off his Besieger and both sides turned to diplomacy (Diod. 20.99; Ager 1996: 59±
61): Ptolemy, in par ticular, had kept the island supplied, so that talks proved to be the
better option. No doubt Ptolemy thought Rhodes some consolation for the loss of
Cyprus: it was perhaps easier now for Ptolemy too to be king. However, it was not all
success: the Antigonids did gain a measure of control over Rhodes. While the island
was to be ungarrisoned, use its own laws and not pay tribute, the Rhodians were to
become the allies of Antigonos (with specific exception for any campaign against
Ptolemy). Moreover, Demetrios was to choose 100 hostages to ensure that the
Rhodians kept their word: these were kept together at Ephesos (Diod. 20.107.4
for their release). Understandably after a year's siege even a mixed outcome was ver y
welcome to the Rhodians, who celebrated with enthusiasm. Kassandros and L ysima
chos were honoured with statues for their par ts in suppor ting the island, while the
crucial role played by Ptolemy brought him a cult, sanctioned by the oracle of
Ammon. Moreover, the island was re-built and beautified, not least with the famous
Colossus (Green 1990: 33; Shipley 2000: 44).
Demetrios sailed on to Greece, where he spent winter 304/3 in Athens, which had
been hard pressed by Kassandros. There, we are told, he set up house in the
Par thenon and, even discounting the more lurid stories, par tied hard. These tales
of impiety and debaucher y are expressions of a profound political and religious debate
at Athens over the nature of the city's relationship with the king whom it had made a
30 David Braund



god. Demetrios ensured that his man, Stratokles, held sway against serious challenge
from Demochares, who championed a more democratic democracy, liberated from
Antigonid control (Parker 1996: 260± 4; Austin 35; Chaniotis, this volume). Demo
chares was also a historian, though we know little of his work (Billows 1990: 337±9).
After that busy winter, Demetrios swiftly removed Ptolemy's garrisons from Sikyon
and Corinth (where he installed his own) in spring 303 and campaigned on into the
Peloponnese, where he married Deidameia, sister of Pyrrhos of Epeiros and impor t
ant enough to have been once betrothed to Alexander IV. Pyrrhos was no friend of
Kassandros: this promised to be a useful marriage. To consolidate the Antigonid
position in central and southern Greece Demetrios proceeded, in 302, to reproduce a
version of Philip II's League of Corinth, with himself and his father as its leaders,
much as Ptolemy may have envisaged in 308. The Antigonids could thereby pose as
the champions of Greek liber ty through unity, but their own concern to dominate
revealed the posture for the political gambit that it surely was. We may recall Anti
gonos' letter to Skepsis, which raised the same issues, as well as the proclamation
outside Tyre and Demetrios' activities in Athens, Sikyon and Corinth: the Antigonids
showed a commitment at least to the posture, suggesting its utility (SV III.446;
Austin 42).
At this juncture, Antigonos and his son finally bit of f more than they could chew.
Kassandros sought terms, having lost his influence in central and southern Greece and
envisaging an Antigonid assault upon Macedonia itself. He was rebuf fed and thus
given no choice but to fight: Antigonos had told him, it seems, that he should hand
over all his possessions, including Macedonia. If Antigonos were to remove Kassan
dros, L ysimachos could not hope to keep Thrace, now at last more or less under his
control. L ysimachos and Kassandros had already been co-operating successfully to
mutual benefit and perhaps even with a measure of friendly af fection. They united
immediately against Antigonos and Demetrios and soon brought in Ptolemy, who
had had his own troubles with them, especially in the loss of Cyprus. Seleukos, who
had finally reached an accommodation with Chandragupta, could expect nothing
good from Antigonid domination and was also quick to of fer suppor t.
Kassandros and L ysimachos took the initiative. Kassandros turned south into
Greece against Demetrios, who was having himself initiated into the Eleusinian
Mysteries in Athens: inconclusive conflicts followed in Thessaly. Meanwhile, L ysima
chos and a par t of Kassandros' army under his general Prepelaos had crossed into Asia
and quickly made a series of gains there: several cities and even some of Antigonos'
commanders in western Asia Minor threw in their lots with the invaders. However,
Antigonos came up from Syria in force and, as winter 302 came on, pressed L ysima
chos back into nor th-west Asia Minor, where L ysimachos had usefully married
Amestris, once wife of Krateros and a niece of Darius himself: she was in control of
the key city of Herakleia Pontike (Diod. 20.107±10; Ameling and Jonnes 1994).
Demetrios, having made a truce with Kassandros on Antigonos' orders, himself
crossed to Asia, won back key cities and penned in L ysimachos' forces. Attempts at
relieving L ysimachos across the Black Sea proved disastrous (Diod. 20.112). In the
meantime Ptolemy had forged into Syria and besieged Sidon, but withdrew again to
Egypt when exaggerated accounts of L ysimachos' dif ficulties reached him. By con
trast Seleukos had entered Cappadocia with a great army, which included some 480
war-elephants from India; he joined with L ysimachos' army as it made its way south.
The Emergence of the Hellenistic World, 323±281 31



In 301 the decisive battle was fought at Ipsos in Phr ygia. If Antigonos and
Demetrios had achieved a clear victor y, there would have been little left to oppose
them but Ptolemy, still in Egypt. But it was Kassandros, L ysimachos and Seleukos
who had the victor y. King Antigonos, now an octogenarian, was killed in battle, while
our sources attribute much of the blame for the crushing defeat to Demetrios, who is
said to have charged of f in hot pursuit with his cavalr y at the height of the battle and
to have been too slow to return to the fray, with dire consequences for his father
and the rest of the army. We should not ourselves charge to follow this tradition
in detail, for it is in the hands of the dramatizing and moralizing Plutarch (Demetr.
29±30).
4 After Ipsos: the Emergence of Dynasties
Demetrios himself escaped the defeat and rode on to Ephesos, where he took ship
and set about recovering his position by sea, without the guidance of Antigonos.
Demetrios had shown his naval competence before, notably against Ptolemy of f
Cyprus, and the island was still his. In the Aegean, perhaps as early as 315/14,
Antigonos had formed the islands of the central Aegean into a league which seems
to have amounted to a federal state, centred upon a council on Delos: it had been a
useful tool of Antigonid power and Demetrios could expect suppor t for his naval
campaigns there too (Austin 1981: 359; Billows 1990: 220±5). Corinth was also
available. But not Athens, where Demetrios had used up his store of goodwill and
now after Ipsos seemed to have little to offer. The city, controlled by Lachares, turned
instead to Kassandros (Habicht 1997).
The victors at Ipsos also had to contend with the new situation after Antigonos.
Seleukos soon quarrelled with Ptolemy over Phoenicia, which was to remain a bone of
contention between their dynasties for centuries after. Ptolemy made an ally of
L ysimachos, who held much of Asia Minor; Seleukos turned to Demetrios, but
they soon fell out. In 298/7 Kassandros' death caused still more instability: his
young sons fought a civil war, which included matricide against Kassandros' widow,
Thessalonike, the sur viving sister of Alexander the Great. Demetrios seized his chance
in 294, taking Athens by siege, campaigning in the Peloponnese and at last seizing
Macedon for himself, killing one of Kassandros' sons and forcing the other into exile
with L ysimachos, who had troubles enough of his own, held captive briefly by the
Getai of the lower Danube (Delev 2000). Demetrios' wife was Kassandros' sister,
Phila: his claim to rule Macedon was more than militar y. Meanwhile, Pyrrhos of
Epeiros had been extending his kingdom into Macedonian territor y, for tified by
good relations with both Ptolemy and Agathokles of Syracuse (Meister 1984); he
also had ambitions in central Greece where he caused trouble for Demetrios in Aitolia
and Boiotia. However, Demetrios was nothing if not energetic: he restored order and
even seized Kerkyra (Cor fu) and Agathokles' daughter, who had brought it to
Pyrrhos as her dowr y. Demetrios and Pyrrhos managed to reach a peace of sor ts in
289, but only after protracted conflict in Greece.
Ptolemy, whose hand may be seen in some of Pyrrhos' activities, had taken back
Cyprus in 295 and a few years later also the league of the islanders (Bagnall 1976:
136±58; Austin 218). In 288/7 he took from Demetrios Sidon and Tyre too, while
L ysimachos and Pyrrhos were pressing him in Macedon itself. In 287 Athens revolted
32 David Braund



against him, suppor ted by Pyrrhos. Demetrios made a desperate bid for Asia, where
his forces dwindled away; in 286 he was captured by Seleukos in the Tauros and met
his end. Again, Plutarch seeks to moralize (Demetr. 46f f.). Ptolemy soon died too,
albeit more comfor tably, in 283, having handed power to his son and heir Ptolemy II
Philadelphos in 285. L ysimachos was the great beneficiar y in all this, gradually
making Macedon his own, together with Thrace and much of Asia Minor, a formid
able kingdom, but one beset by palace intrigue ± apparently formidable even by
Hellenistic standards (Shipley 2000: 48±51 is nicely nuanced on this, while Ogden
1999 encompasses Hellenistic dynastic standards in general). Pyrrhos had been
forced back, despite an alliance with Demetrios' son, Antigonos Gonatas, who had
been left behind in Greece; as yet not quite a leading player, he had much of the
Peloponnese, a foothold in Thessaly and more besides.
Seleukos seized the moment, perhaps incited by L ysimachos' problems at home
and in his uneasy kingdom, but with ambition enough besides. Having invaded
western Asia Minor, he defeated and killed L ysimachos at the Battle of Koroupedion
near Sardis in 281. However, after crossing into Europe, evidently en route to claim
Macedon, Seleukos was murdered by Ptolemy Keraunos, a son of Ptolemy, who had
sought Seleukos' patronage, having lost his hopes of the throne of Egypt when
Ptolemy had rejected his mother Eur ydike in favour of Berenike, mother of Phila
delphos. True to his sobriquet (Keraunos, or `Thunderbolt') the murderer was quick
to conceal his crime and had his victim's army proclaim him king.
The years 323±281 had been full of war and diplomatic complexities after the
shattering loss of Alexander. Yet, amid all the conflict and fragmentation that ensued,
Macedonian control of Alexander's heritage had been maintained for the most par t
and gradually stabilized, even at its eastern limits. By 281 a new world order had
developed and the foundation had been set for the king-orientated practices of a
Hellenistic world which would find in these years the roots and exemplars of its
traditions. Two of the great dynasties were broadly in place: most firmly the Ptol
emies, but also the Seleukids, for Seleukos had already appointed his successor,
Antiochos I, before setting out to Koroupedion. The Antigonids were in a more
parlous state, but Antigonos Monophthalmos and Demetrios Poliorketes would
cer tainly be remembered, while Antigonos Gonatas, Monophthalmos' grandson,
had already star ted to make his own way.

CHRONOLOGICAL NOTE
The dating of the events in the years of the successor s through to 311 is complex and
controversial. The present chapter follows the low chronology advocated by R. M.
Errington in JHS 90 (1970) 49±77 and Hermes 105 (1977) 478±504. Recently ,
however, A. B. Bosw or th and P . Wheatly have revived the high chronology , A. B.
Boswor th, Chiron 22 (1992) 55±81, P . Wheatley , Phoneix 52 (1998) 257±81, all
underpinning A. B. Bosworth, The Legacy of Alexander: Politics, Propaganda and
War fare under the Successors (2002). Thus, for example, the low chronology would
date it to the previous year, though the sequence of events remains the same.

CHAPTER THREE
An Uneasy Balance:
from the Death of Seleukos
to the Battle of Raphia
Sheila L. Ager
`There is nothing about L ykourgos that is not a matter of dispute,' says Plutarch in
his introduction to the Life of the Spartan legislator, `not his family, or his travels, or
his death, or his reforms, or even when he lived.'
Plutarch was speaking of the obscurity of a pre-Classical period, but the same might
be said for other times in Greek histor y, and of these, by far the most impenetrable is
the third centur y B C . Like Plutarch, we are faced with the task of reconstructing not
only why or how things happened, but simply what happened. Our only sur viving
continuous narrative for much of the period is Justin, whose predilection for tales of
cour t intrigue and treacher y, aberrant sexuality and murder make him one of the
soapiest of the ancient writers. It is true that the third centur y does of fer some
compensation for the lack of literar y sources in the wealth of sur viving papyri and
inscriptions. The challenge, however, lies in interpreting this material without a
context. The temptation to flights of reconstructive fancy is great, and we may be
in danger of seeking too much of a coherent pattern in a centur y where chaos theor y
might be a better methodology.
1 Chaos: the Years from 281 to 276
The term `chaos' might be extreme for some regions of the Hellenistic world in 281.
After all, in Egypt Ptolemy II had safely followed his father on the throne in 283, with
minimal succession trauma. All the same, even Ptolemy felt the need to rid himself of
super fluous siblings ± two brothers were executed or assassinated, and it is wor th
noting that Ptolemy Keraunos had already left Egypt `in fear' because their father had
named his younger half-brother as heir (Paus. 1.7.1; App. Syr. 62). The monarchies
were all new ones, with no firmly established pattern of succession, and elsewhere the
situation was not so tranquil even as in Egypt. With the deaths of L ysimachos and
Seleukos, royal control in the regions of Macedon and Asia Minor was severely
shaken. L ysimachos had left no viable heir, though his eldest son by Arsinoe lived



to trouble his contemporaries, and to trouble generations of modern scholars even
more. Seleukos, on the other hand, left a highly competent heir: his son by the
Iranian Apame, Antiochos I. In 281 Antiochos had already been co-regent for over a
decade. Even so, he was going to face serious challenges posed both by his father's
victor y and by his death.
Justin touches briefly on Ptolemy Keraunos' political and militar y successes in
establishing his rule in Macedon in the face of inherited enmities ± he defeated
Demetrios' son Antigonos Gonatas in a naval battle, and made peace with Seleukos'
son Antiochos in the winter of 281/0 ± but the historian saves his pen for the stor y
that really caught his interest: the interaction of Keraunos with his half-sister Arsinoe,
the widow of L ysimachos. It was imperative that Keraunos neutralize the claims of
Arsinoe's sons to the throne of their father's kingdom. A marriage with his half-sister
was the per fect solution; for Arsinoe herself, this may have been an oppor tunity
unhoped for, one that would enable her to be a queen again (Carney 1994). The
only hindrance to the success of this plan was Arsinoe's eldest child, Ptolemy, who,
while young, was far from naive. He warned his mother against the marriage; that he
had no intention of quashing his own ambitions is evident from the fact that he
shor tly embarked on a militar y campaign against his new stepfather. This ill
mannered behaviour may have prompted Keraunos to the action so luridly described
by Justin: the murder of Arsinoe's younger boys in their mother's arms (Just. 24.3;
Heinen 1972: 75±83).
Keraunos might have succeeded in his bid for power in Macedon had it not been
for a singular event that had long term repercussions: the invasion of the Celts. About
Februar y of 279, a Celtic band invaded Macedon, and repaid Keraunos for all his
crimes (as Justin saw it) by killing him in battle and sticking his head on a pike. An
invasion later in the year that penetrated all the way to Delphi had an even greater
impact on the Greek mind, and though the Celts were driven out of Greece, they
subsequently irrupted into Asia Minor, and `filled it like a swarm' (Just. 25.2.8).
There they became a constant danger, always simmering beneath the sur face, and
frequently boiling over, making their own contribution to the destabilizing forces at
work in the third centur y (OGIS 765, trans. Burstein 17; I.Er ythrai 24, 28; Mitchell,
this volume).
To one individual, however, the Celts proved a blessing in disguise. Antigonos
Gonatas was still wearily searching for a territorial kingdom in which to situate
himself. After an abortive ef for t in Asia Minor (an ef for t which culminated peacefully
in a marriage alliance that made Gonatas Antiochos I's brother-in-law twice over),
Gonatas returned to the European side of the Hellespont. There he encountered and
defeated a force of Celts near L ysimacheia (Memnon FGrH 434 F10; Trogus Prol.
24; Just. 25.1±2; Hammond and Walbank 1988: 581). Macedon, in the meantime,
had been in a desperate condition. The sources name several would-be rulers after
Keraunos' death, including Ptolemy the son of L ysimachos, but in reality Macedon
remained in a pitiable state of anarchy for years. Gonatas, fresh from his victor y at
L ysimacheia, was the most viable candidate the wounded countr y had seen in some
time. The kingdom without a king and the king without a kingdom had found each
other, and by 276 Antigonos Gonatas was ruler of Macedon.
The state of documentation in the Seleukid kingdom is so tattered that it has
provided scholars with the oppor tunity (depending on one's point of view) either to
36 Sheila L. Ager



reconstr uct carefully a real but vanished episode, or to fabricate entirely an ephemeral
non-event: the so-called `War of the Syrian Succession', a war between Antiochos I
and Ptolemy II (c. 280/79). Given that the ver y existence of this war is in doubt, it
seems best not to include it in the `canon' of Syrian Wars that begins with the First
Syrian War of 274±271. The term `Syrian War' has long been recognized as a
misnomer, since much of the fighting during the Syrian Wars took place elsewhere
than in this cul-de-sac at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. But wherever the
fighting took place, the Syrian border between the Ptolemaic and the Seleukid
empires was an eternal hot spot, a point of friction that in the third centur y was
never alleviated.
Chief among the contemporar y sources for the putative succession war is an
inscription from Ilion (OGIS 219, trans. Austin 139), which refers to the troubles
Antiochos faced from rebels in Seleukis (nor th Syria), and to the attacks of external
enemies from outside the kingdom. This inscription is usually dated to the years
immediately after Antiochos' accession, and it is assumed that those enemies include
Ptolemy II. Vigorous arguments about the date ± whether the inscription refers to
Antiochos I or to Antiochos III ± mean that the hypothesis of a Syrian war at the time
of Antiochos I's accession remains an unresolved question (Mastrocinque 1987/8;
Piejko 1991; C. Jones 1993; cf. Ma 1999: 254±9). Never theless, it is cer tain that
Antiochos did face a number of challenges, par ticularly in Asia Minor, where the
dif ficulties of establishing Seleukid influence in the remains of L ysimachos' kingdom
were exacerbated by the presence of the unr uly Celts. But as with Gonatas, a militar y
victor y over the Celts promised glor y and (perhaps more impor tant) legitimation for
a Macedonian r uler. Antiochos defeated them in the famous `elephant battle', perhaps
c
. 270 (or a little later), as a result of which he was given the cognomen `Saviour'
(App. Syr. 65; WÈ orrle 1975).
The mid-270s, with Gonatas established in Macedon and Antiochos having suc
cessfully weathered whatever succession crisis he faced, have conventionally been held
to be the beginning of the `stable' years. Whether this was so or not remains to be
seen.
2 Ptolemy Against the World: the First Syrian and
Chremonidean Wars
While his counterpar ts Gonatas and Antiochos were battling to secure their king
doms, Ptolemy II was gaining a reputation (in the modern world at any rate) for
being an unwarlike, and downright un-Macedonian monarch. The eminent old
school historian W. W. Tarn had this to say about him:
Alone of the kings of his time he was no warrior. . . . The prince who presided over Egypt's
age of gold was but a sickly creature, a devotee of pleasure in all its forms, ever seeking new
pastimes and new sensations . . . , one who exhausted ever y form of luxur y, and who,
prostrated by gout, envied the simple joys of the beggars below his window, even while
he dabbled in search after the elixir that should make him immor tal. (1913: 216)
An outmoded prejudice, of course, inspired by admiration for Ptolemy's enemy, the
Stoic Gonatas. Ptolemy fought his own share of battles, though not always in person;
From the Death of Seleukos to the Battle of Raphia 37



no one today would see it as a cause for criticism that he had other dimensions to his
character. The common pattern of tensions in the third centur y saw Ptolemy at odds
with his neighbours Antiochos I and II over the `Syrian' question on the one hand,
and with Gonatas in Greece and the Aegean on the other. Whether the Antigonids
and Seleukids, friendly since 278, combined to stand against Ptolemy in any ef fective
or consistent way is one of the open questions of third centur y histor y. The diplo
matic isolation of Egypt may have been among the factors that prompted Ptolemy II
to send an embassy to Rome in 273 (Hauben 1983). The Romans responded
amicably, though their ambassadors declined the lavish gifts Ptolemy tried to present
to them; no doubt Ptolemy's descendant Auletes could have wished that the Romans
of his day would display a similar lack of avarice.
Whether or not Ptolemy made major gains against Antiochos I in a war around
280/79, Ptolemaic holdings were cer tainly extensive by this time. In the Aegean
Egypt had assumed the leadership of the Nesiotic (`Island') League, and had estab
lished a presence along the Karian and Ionian coasts (SIG
3 390, trans. Austin 218,
c. 280±278, date disputed by Hazzard 2000: 47±58; SIG
3 322, trans. Burstein 25;
SEG 1.363, trans. Austin 135). Ptolemaic foreign policy is often interpreted as
`defensive imperialism' (Will 1979: 153±208), the premise being that the Ptolemies
were primarily interested in securing the strategic and economic well-being of Egypt
itself. Their holdings beyond its borders ± Syria, Cyprus, Cyrene, various places along
the coast of Asia Minor and in the Aegean ± would have been intended as a perimeter
ring that would not only provide a for ward defence, but that would also bring Egypt
the vital natural resources that she herself could not supply, such as timber and
metals. This view has much to be said for it, but it is open to challenge on some
points. In this context let it simply be said that for a state that was interested primarily
in security rather than aggrandisement, the Ptolemaic regime was extraordinarily
active outside its own borders. The Aegean, where the sea both united and divided,
and made the islands both liminal and central to the rivalries of the kingdoms,
became a frequent battleground. And one of the most crucial of those borders was
the frontier between Ptolemaic and Seleukid Syria, which for most of the third
centur y ran along the Eleutheros river and through the Bekaa valley (Grainger
1991: 67).
Like the putative War of the Syrian Succession, the First Syrian War (274?±271?) is
known to us only through fragmentar y and scattered references. Pausanias refers to
collusion between Antiochos I and his son-in-law, Magas, Ptolemy's half-brother and
ruler of Cyrene (1.7.1±3). The collusion was not ver y well co-ordinated, and
amounted to little, except that Magas did succeed in establishing a degree of inde
pendence for himself in Cyrene. A Babylonian astronomical diar y informs us that in
274/3 Antiochos abandoned for the moment his Asia Minor pursuits, advancing to
Syria to confront the Egyptian enemy (Sachs and Hunger 1988: no. 273; Sher win
White and Kuhr t 1993: 46±7; Austin 141). We learn from an Egyptian hieroglyphic
document, the `Pithom stele', that in early 273 Ptolemy was at Pithom on the eastern
borders of Egypt to defend Egypt against invasion, and that he may have conducted
an (unsuccessful?) campaign in Palestine (Lor ton 1971). The war was perhaps over by
271/0, and may have had a finale that Ptolemy had cause to celebrate, if the stupefy
ingly extravagant pageant of Ptolemy II described by the Rhodian writer Kallixeinos is
to be dated to that year (Athen. 5.196±203).

Arsinoe II on the reverse (left), and their parents, Ptolemy I and Berenike I on the obverse
(right). Cour tesy of the British Museum
At Ptolemy's side when he was at Pithom in Januar y of 273 was his new(ish) bride:
his older sister Arsinoe. After her disastrous marriage to her half-brother Keraunos,
she had fled to Samothrace, and then to Egypt. She was evidently willing to give both
queenship and brother-marriage another tr y, and at some point before 274 she
married her full brother Ptolemy II. The incestuous marriage (whence both Arsinoe
and Ptolemy are known by the epithet `Philadelphos') provoked revulsion among
Greeks, though it may have been more acceptable to the Egyptian population. The
cour t poet Theocritus, in one of his more sycophantic moments, tried to clean up the
marriage for Greek consumption by likening it to the marriage of Zeus and Hera
(Id. 17), but the more commonly held view was no doubt expressed in the indelicate
remark of Sotades (Athen. 14.621a). Theocritus' position was clearly the more
rewarding one to hold ± the tactless Sotades was sealed in a lead jar and dropped
into the sea to drown.
In the past Arsinoe has been seen as far more ambitious, competent and politically
ruthless than her (allegedly) indolent and sensual brother. This view has been rejected
(Burstein 1982; Hazzard 2000: 81±100), but the epigraphic and numismatic evi
dence does suggest that Arsinoe II ± for whatever reason ± held a unique position. An
Egyptian inscription refers to her as `the king of Upper and Lower Egypt' (Quaege
beur 1998: no. 42), and Ptolemy issued a remarkable coinage emphasizing the
marital par tnership by presenting his profile side-by-side with that of his sister-wife
(Mùrkholm 1991: no. 297; figure 3.1). Among the Ptolemaic foundations or refoun
dations along the coasts of Asia Minor, Greece, and the islands are no less than twelve
`Arsinoes' (G. Cohen 1995). And one of the most hotly debated pieces of Arsinoe
evidence is the famous inscription from Athens, SIG
3 434/5, a document which
brings us to the next Ptolemaic conflict: the Chremonidean War (trans. Austin 49).
The inscription records a decree, moved by one Chremonides and passed in Athens
in the archonship of Peithidemos (268/7 or 265/4; Heinen 1972; Gabber t 1987;
Habicht 1997; Dreyer 1999a). The Athenians resolve to fight against `those who are
tr ying to destroy the laws and the ancestral constitutions of the cities, those who have
wronged the cities and broken treaties'. The reference, while unspecified, is clearly to
From the Death of Seleukos to the Battle of Raphia 39



Antigonos Gonatas. Since assuming control of Macedon, Gonatas had worked to
consolidate his control both there and at the key points later to be called the `fetters
of Greece': Demetrias in Thessaly, Chalkis on the island of Euboia, and Corinth on
the Isthmus. The Athenian por t of Piraeus was also in his hands, and we do not need
to look much fur ther for Athenian motivation in declaring war on Gonatas, though
Gonatas' aggressions in Euboia will also have been alarming (Knoepfler 1993;
Habicht 1992; 1997: 143).
The years since 276 had been challenging ones for the Antigonid ruler. He had
been forced to deal with the intrusions of the bellicose ruler of Epeiros, Pyrrhos, back
from his Italian adventure in 275/4. Pyrrhos had mounted an invasion of Macedon
that had actually forced Gonatas back on his coastal holdings. Diver ted from there by
an opening in the Peloponnese, Pyrrhos met his death fighting both Spar tans and
Macedonians at Argos in 272, after being stunned by a roof tile dropped on his head
by an Argive woman (Just. 25.4±5; Plut. Pyrrh. 26±34; Polyaen. 8.68). Gonatas no
doubt heaved a sigh of relief to have the plaguey, but peculiarly feckless Pyrrhos out
of the way, and took the oppor tunity to extend his influence in the Peloponnese
(Just. 26.1, 1±3). Spar ta would not have been happy, and so, in spite of the brief
co-operation with Gonatas in 272, the Spar tans and their king Areus were equal
par tners with Athens in the Chremonides decree. Indeed, Areus' name figures so
conspicuously in the decree, and in the rarefied literar y evidence for the ensuing war,
that we might be tempted to call this the `Arean War'.
Prominent also in the anti-Macedonian coalition recorded in the inscription was
the name of Ptolemy, who was evidently eager to suppor t the `common freedom of
the Greeks', in accordance with the policy `of his ancestors and his sister'. The
reference to a woman in this context is extraordinar y and has led to much debate
on the role of Arsinoe in the Chremonidean War; it is even more striking when we
consider that she had probably been dead for some time (ef for ts have been made to
date her death to 268, but in all likelihood she was dead by July 270; Cadell 1998).
The view was long held that Arsinoe instigated the war in order to have Ptolemy, her
son by L ysimachos, enthroned in Macedon. But there is no need to seek Ptolemaic
motivation in pressure from a domineering sister-wife ± still less in an altruistic and
disinterested suppor t of Greek freedom. Ptolemaic policy had long been friendly to
Athens' ef for ts to resist the Antigonids (Habicht 1992), and Philadelphos may have
been alarmed at the ramifications of Macedonian recover y, par ticularly if Gonatas was
developing the naval arm of the Macedonian militar y (Will 1979: 220±1).
Pausanias, one of our ver y few literar y references, says that `nothing remarkable'
came of the Ptolemaic suppor t for Athens (1.7.3). Archaeological, epigraphic, and
numismatic evidence from Attica acts as a corrective on Pausanias' remark, showing
that Ptolemy's commander Patroklos was doing perhaps the best he could with what
resources he had (McCredie 1966; Heinen 1972: 152±4; Habicht 1997: 145). In the
end, however, it really did come down to nothing remarkable. Areus was killed
fighting on the Isthmus of Corinth, and Athens was finally forced to capitulate, in
the spring of 262 or 261. Not only did Gonatas still hold the Piraeus, he now installed
a garrison in the city of Athens itself, and imposed a pro-Macedonian governor for
the next several years. And perhaps it was as a finale to the Ptolemaic±Antigonid
hostilities in the Chremonidean War that Antigonos triumphed in a naval victor y over
Ptolemy's fleet in a sea battle of f the island of Kos.
40 Sheila L. Ager



If the Battle of Kos was indeed fought at the close of the Chremonidean War, it
would mean that Ptolemy was right to be concer ned about Antigonid naval activity.
Antigonos' fleet may also have been assaulting Ptolemaic interests along the Karian
and Ionian coast (RC 14, Austin 270). By the close of the 260s, Ptolemy's naval pre
eminence was, at the ver y least, no longer unchallenged. As for Gonatas, he had
secured his r ule in Macedon, and ensured that individual states like Athens or Spar ta
could not ef fectively challenge him in Greece again.
In Asia, Antiochos I died in 261, having throughout his reign been engaged in the
`many wars' that Memnon speaks of (FGrH 434 F9). Towards the end of his reign a
new enemy appeared where once there had been a friend. Eumenes, the nephew of
Philetairos of Pergamon, took over upon his uncle's death in 263, and ver y shor tly
demonstrated that he intended Pergamon to be independent, defeating Antiochos in
battle near Sardis c. 262 (Strabo 13.4.2). Antiochos was no more than about sixty
years of age when he died and left his kingdom to his homonymous son, but no
doubt much of his life energy had gone into the strenuous ef for ts to maintain his
immense kingdom with its many unstable frontiers.
3 Mid-Centur y Crisis: the Second and Third Syrian Wars and the
Kings' Household Dilemmas
By the time two generations had passed, all the r ulers of the Successor kingdoms were
related to one another. Ptolemy III was a second cousin to Antiochos II, and a first
cousin, once removed, to Antigonos Gonatas; Gonatas and Antiochos, for their par t,
were uncle and nephew. But blood relationships amongst royalty rarely do much to
uphold conventional family values. If the third centur y witnessed little strife between
the closely related Antigonids and Seleukids, it was only because their spheres of
interest rarely clashed. Dynastic rivalries and succession crises are a continuing thread
in the stor y of the relationship between Ptolemies and Seleukids. The tale of the
Third Syrian War illustrates just how bloody royal blood relationships could get, and
it demonstrates also that the vaunting ambitions of the period of the Diadochoi never
really disappeared. Of par ticular interest during the Second and Third Syrian Wars is
the question of whether Antigonos Gonatas inter vened in these conflicts, forcing the
Ptolemies to fight on more fronts than they wanted. The sea battles of Kos and
Andros, events which float in the literature without anchors, are often set in the
context of these wars (Kos is generally dated either to c. 261 or to c. 255, Andros to
246/5). The notion that Gonatas worked the Aegean front for his Seleukid relatives
during these wars will suit those who find conspiracy theories attractive, but there is
no proof of any kind.
We have little indication of fighting in Syria itself during the Second `Syrian' War
(260?±253). An ostrakon bearing a demotic Egyptian text that calls for an inventor y
of the land of Egypt may have bearing on the economic measures necessar y for the
conduct of the war, and may refer to a victorious Ptolemaic campaign in Syria
(Bresciani 1978; HÈ olbl 2001: 44; Burstein 97). Much of what evidence there is,
however, points to conflict in Asia Minor. The naval state of Rhodes may have taken
the side of Antiochos II ± a notable circumstance, as the interests of Rhodes and the
Ptolemies usually ran in the same track (SIG
3
725, trans. Burstein 46; Frontin. Str.
3.9, 10; Polyaen. 5.18; Seiber t 1976). The polis of Miletos was a more passive victim
From the Death of Seleukos to the Battle of Raphia 41



of royal rivalries. Sometime around 259 Miletos fell under the sway of a tyrant, an
Aitolian emigrÂ e by the name of Timarchos. Subsequently the Milesians were the first
to give Antiochos II the sobriquet
Theos
(`the God') when he wrested the city from
Timarchos' control and killed the tyrant, thereby bringing the Milesians into the
Seleukid camp. Before his death, Timarchos may also have disr upted Ptolemaic
control of Samos (App.
Syr
. 65; Frontin.
Str
. 3.2, 11).
Timarchos is also connected to the most mysterious and controversial figure of the
third centur y BC
: the elusive and ever-challenging `Ptolemy the Son'. The prologue to
the vanished book 26 of Trogus tells us that `in Asia the son of King Ptolemy, with
Timarchos as his ally, revolted against his father'. There seems to be no question that
this rebellious of fspring is the same as the `Ptolemy, son of Ptolemy' who appears in
numerous papyri as the co-regent of Ptolemy II Philadelphos between 267 and 259.
His disappearance from the co-regency in 259 must be connected to his rebellion,
though whether as cause or ef fect is indeterminable. But who exactly
was
`Ptolemy
the Son'? Was he Ptolemy III Euergetes, who ultimately succeeded to the throne in
246 (a next to impossible choice)? Was he a bastard son of Philadelphos, who had
enough mistresses that one of his descendants made a catalogue of them (a popular
choice)? Was he a son of Philadelphos and Arsinoe II, in spite of all the sources say
about that incestuous marriage being childless? Was he an unattested son of Phila
delphos and his first wife, and hence the full brother of Euergetes? Was he an adoptive
son of Philadelphos, none other than the son of Arsinoe by her first husband
L ysimachos? The last ± that `Ptolemy the Son' is to be identified with the son of
Arsinoe and L ysimachos, adopted by his uncle-stepfather ± is a choice that had fallen
out of favour, but has recently been reformulated (Huss 1998). Huss's argument
resurrects an old rationale for the Chremonidean War: Philadelphos, who had no
desire to undergo the same experience as his half-brother Keraunos, was seeking a
throne for his mettlesome adoptive son that would settle him far away from Egypt.
A papyrus that is most impor tant for Ptolemaic histor y in the third centur y (
P.Haun
.
6) may contribute the information that the Son (having reconciled with his adoptive
family after the revolt of 259), fought in the Battle of Andros, and went on to make
conquests for the Ptolemaic side on the coast of Thrace. He would have died some
time after 239, having led a most stimulating life and reached at least sixty-plus years
of age. Huss's position is eloquently argued, but no doubt we have not heard the last
of Ptolemy the Son (Tunny 2000; Gygax 2000). The discover y of a new inscription
or papyr us could bring about a complete reshuf fling of all the pieces.
The finale to the Second Syrian War sowed the seeds of the Third Syrian War. The
peace settlement in 253 was sealed with a marriage alliance: Antiochos II was to
repudiate his wife Laodike, the mother of his sons Seleukos and Antiochos, and marr y
Philadelphos' daughter Berenike. Philadelphos will surely have insisted that Antio
chos get his heir from the Ptolemaic princess, passing over his sons by Laodike
(Beyer-Rotthof f 1993:18±19); Berenike's father is said to have been so desirous
that his daughter prove fer tile that he regularly sent her Nile water to drink. The
marriage settlement calls into question the general (if tentative) consensus that the
outcome of the Second Syrian War, because of his losses in the Aegean, was unfavour
able to Ptolemy II. The marriage in fact proved to be unfavourable to the Seleukids,
imposing on their dynasty the burden of `amphimetric strife' (Ogden 1999: 128±9).
Amphimetric strife ± the conflict between royal children of the same father and
42
Sheila L. Ager



dif ferent mothers ± had already destroyed the house of L ysimachos. Philadelphos,
married to a sur vivor of that conflict, knew ver y well what might ensue.
As it turned out, Philadelphos was dead (Januar y 246) by the time the crisis arose
in the Seleukid house, a crisis precipitated by the death of Antiochos a few months
later. Rumour (Seleukid) had it that Antiochos had reconciled with his wife Laodike
and had named her son Seleukos as his heir. Other rumours (Ptolemaic) claimed that
Laodike had poisoned Antiochos and declared her son his father's successor. Berenike
instantly declared her own infant son as the king, barricaded herself in her position at
Antioch, and sent out a call for help. The classic amphimetric strife was under way, and
was to have far-reaching consequences.
Berenike's brother, Ptolemy III Euergetes, responded to her call and set out with
his forces to come to her rescue in Antioch, intent on ensuring the accession of his
own nephew to the Seleukid throne. Before he arrived, the rules of the game had
changed drastically: Berenike and her son were murdered (Just. 27.1; App.Syr. 65).
Emotional ramifications aside, this was strategically a most awkward turn of events for
Euergetes. With Berenike and the child still living, he could play the role of defender
of the rightful heir; with their deaths, he became a foreign invader. It would therefore
have been expedient to keep the news of the murders from spreading as long as
possible. A curious anecdote in Polyaenus suggests that the murders were indeed
covered up for a time (8.50). But a far more remarkable piece of evidence is a papyrus
from Gourob, which appears to be a sort of war `bulletin' issued by Ptolemy himself
(FGrH 160, trans. Austin 220; Piejko 1990). Like most war bulletins, it presents only
the good news: Ptolemy arrives in Seleukeia, the por t city at the mouth of the
Orontes, to the cheering of the crowds, and has the same astonishingly warm
reception in Antioch itself, the ver y hear t of Seleukis. After all the rejoicing and
backslapping, he then, `as the day was getting on towards evening, went in to the
sister'. The unadorned statement provokes suspicion that she was already dead (after
all, why wasn't she at the celebrations?), and that Ptolemy conspired to conceal his
sister's death as long as he could.
It was to his immediate advantage. The ancient sources are unanimous in saying
that from Antioch, Euergetes went on to an astonishing and unparalleled assault on
the Seleukid realm. From Syria he advanced to Mesopotamia and, according to one
exuberant writer, secured the countr y all the way from the Tauros mountains to India
without a single militar y engagement (Polyaen. 8.50; Just. 27.1; App. Syr. 65). In
fact, if it were not that the king was recalled by the news of an insurrection in Egypt,
says Justin, he would have taken over the entire Seleukid kingdom (cf.P.Haun. 6.15;
Peremans 1978; 1981; McGing 1997). Just how far Ptolemy actually went (probably
only as far as Babylon), or how lasting his `conquests' were (already by 245 his enemy
Seleukos II was recognized formally as king there), are debatable points. How far his
propaganda claimed he went is another matter. A lost inscription from Adoulis on the
Red Sea lists Ptolemy's version of events:
Great King Ptolemy (III) . . . , having inherited from his father the kingdom of Egypt and
Libya and Syria and Phoenicia and Cyprus and L ykia and Karia and the Kyklades islands,
led a campaign into Asia with infantr y and cavalr y and fleet and Troglodytic and
Ethiopian elephants . . . . Having become master of all the land this side of the Euphrates
and of Cilicia and Pamphylia and Ionia and the Hellespont and Thrace and of all the

forces and Indian elephants in these lands, and having made subject all the princes in the
(various) regions, he crossed the Euphrates river, and after subjecting to himself Meso
potamia and Babylonia and Susiana and Persis and Media and all the rest of the land up to
Baktria . . . . (
OGIS
54, trans. as BD 26; also Austin 221)
This expedition of Euergetes at the beginning of the Third Syrian War is perhaps
better understood as a kind of `triumphal progress' than a militar y campaign, possible
because there was as yet no organized resistance to him. Ptolemaic seizure of
the entire Seleukid empire was not sustainable, and Ptolemy had suf ficient demands
on him back in the Mediterranean. Aside from the native rebellion in Egypt, there
was also the old enemy Antigonos Gonatas to consider. Antigonid ef for ts to inter
fere in Cyrene after Philadelphos' half-brother Magas died (
c
. 250, bizarrely choking
to death because he was so grossly fat), by sending out a half-brother of Gonatas
(known as `Demetrios the Handsome') to marr y Magas' daughter Berenike, had
backfired. Berenike was not taken with Macedon's marital candidate (perhaps because
her decorative fiancÂ e was having an af fair with her mother Apame), and had
Demetrios assassinated. She thereupon mar ried her cousin Euergetes, and brought
Cyrene once more under Ptolemaic r ule (Just. 26.3.2±8). But if things went
poorly for Antigonid schemes in Cyrene, Gonatas was still able to fetch a blow to
Ptolemaic interests in the Aegean in late 246 or early 245. This is the now widely
accepted date for another Antigonid naval victor y over Ptolemaic forces, the Battle
of Andros.
Together, the Battles of Kos and Andros have been seen as forcing a decisive
rollback in Ptolemaic power in the Aegean (for sources and a discussion of the
possible dates of these battles: Buraselis 1982: 119±51; Reger 1985; Hammond
and Walbank 1988: 587±600). Cer tainly after about 260 the Antigonid presence is
more apparent in the Aegean, and the evidence for Ptolemaic leadership in the
Nesiotic League disappears. But nothing in the sources tells us that either Kos or
Andros was a cr ushing defeat for the Ptolemies. If Euergetes did suf fer a naval defeat
in the Aegean in the early years of the Third Syrian War, he also made
gains
along the
coast of Thrace and in the Hellespontine region (
OGIS
54;
P.Haun
. 6, 7; Bagnall
1976: 162), not to mention in Ionia, where Samos seems to have once again become
Ptolemaic (
SEG
1.366, trans. Austin 113).
The chief significance of the Third Syrian War lies not so much in the monumental,
and ephemeral, territorial gains adver tised in the Adoulis inscription, but rather in the
thorough shaking it gave to the Seleukid dynasty. Seleukeia, one of the four cities of
Seleukis, and Antioch's outlet to the Mediterranean, remained Ptolemaic until 219
and would have ser ved as a constant reminder of the outrage of Euergetes' progress
through the hear t of the empire, a political, strategic, and economic choke-hold on
the Seleukids (JÈ ahne 1974; Beyer-Rotthof f 1993: 51±2). While the claims of Ptole
my's propaganda about the war are surely inflated, it is still tr ue that Seleukos II had
found it almost impossible to counter the Egyptian of fensive ef fectively. By 241 he
was forced to of fer his younger brother Antiochos the r ule in Asia Minor in return for
his suppor t against Ptolemy, a move that prompted Ptolemy to conclude a peace
treaty (Just. 27.2.9). But Seleukos was now about to face enormous grief from the
four teen year old Antiochos, who `had a lust for power beyond his years' (Just.
27.2.7; Yardley trans.).

4 Internal Affairs: the Years from 241 to 221
In 240/39 Antigonos Gonatas died at the age of eighty. Aside from the Battle of
Andros, he had been little involved with the international scene in recent years. Af fairs
in Greece ± the revolt of his nephew Alexander, the seizure of Corinth in 243 by the
Achaian general Aratos ± had absorbed most of his energies. For the next two
decades, with few pauses, the Achaians were to be hostile to Macedonian interests
in Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt lost no oppor tunity to create trouble for the Anti
gonids there. Already in 250 Philadelphos had granted Aratos 150 talents to `fight
the good fight', and in 243 the Achaians named Euergetes theirhegemon by land and
sea (Plut. Arat. 11±13; 24). No doubt this was an honorific position ± subventions
were enough at this stage to protect Ptolemaic interests in the Aegean. Gonatas did
little to harm those interests in the last few years of his reign, and his son and heir
Demetrios II (239±229) was too busy fighting the `Demetrian War' against both
Achaians and Aitolians to take much note of af fairs in the wider world of the
kingdoms (Scholten, this volume).
The Seleukids too were preoccupied with internal calamity after the end of the
Third Syrian War. At one end of the empire, Seleukos II had to cope with the peeling
away of his eastern satrapies. The sources unfor tunately do not give us an unambigu
ous picture of the events that eventually saw Baktria and Par thia established as
independent kingdoms, and there is much debate about the dates involved, but the
movement seems to have begun by about the middle of the third centur y (Just. 41.1±
5; Strabo 11.9.2±3; Arrian FGrH 156 F31±2; App. Syr. 65). Rebellion by Seleukid
governors, rebellion that the king did not have the time or manpower to suppress,
forms par t of the picture. Another ingredient was the infiltration of the nomadic
Parni, who eventually established themselves and their rule in Par thia. The apostasy of
the eastern empire did not occur overnight (Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 84±90,
107±11), but the sources are unanimous in connecting at least the beginning of the
defections to the circumstances of the Third Syrian War (or perhaps even earlier). We
must therefore add troubles in the east to the dif ficulties Seleukos II had to face (Will
1979: 281±90; Musti 1984: 210±20).
More immediately before the eyes of contemporar y Mediterranean obser vers were
the problems that Seleukos was having with his little brother. Rumoured to be
rapacious in his `lust for power', Antiochos received the nickname Hierax, the
`Hawk'. Almost immediately upon the conclusion of peace with Ptolemy, Seleukos
found himself at war with his sibling, who had the suppor t of their mother Laodike.
Hierax defeated Seleukos near Ankyra in 240 or 239 and forced him out of Asia
Minor (Just. 27.2, 10±12; Athen. 13.593e; Plut. Mor. 184a, 489a±b). But things did
not thereupon go swimmingly for Antiochos ± a new opponent presented himself in
the person of Attalos, who had succeeded to the rule of Pergamon in 241. Attalos was
not one to let his own good deeds go unpraised: numerous monuments and inscrip
tions attest to his victories over Antiochos Hierax and over Hierax's sometime
mercenaries, the Galatian descendants of the Celts (OGIS 272±280; Austin 197;
Burstein 85). By 228 he had closed Asia Minor to Hierax. But Attalos' attitude
towards the Hawk was not an ideological one. He was not suppor ting the `rightful'
king, Seleukos II, against a usurper ± he was intent, rather, on the aggrandizement of
Pergamon and the creation of his own monarchy.
From the Death of Seleukos to the Battle of Raphia 45



After his defeat in Asia, Hierax appeared in Alexandria, prompting us to wonder
whether he had not received some Ptolemaic suppor t all along, perhaps in the
favourite form of financial subsidies to pay his Galatian mercenaries (Just. 27.3.9±
10). It is true that Euergetes kept him confined in some way ± his depar ture from
Alexandria is described as an escape ± but then that was also the fate of another
Ptolemaic subvention recipient, Kleomenes, a few years later. Hierax fled to Thrace
and was murdered (ironically, by Celts) in 227, shor tly before his brother Seleukos
was killed in a fall from his horse (226/5; Just. 27.3.12). Seleukos was succeeded by
his son Seleukos III, but the latter did not sur vive his accession for long. He was
assassinated in 223 (by a Celt) as he was marching into Asia Minor to confront Attalos
(Polyb. 4.48, 8; App. Syr. 66). For the troubled Seleukid kingdom, this death marked
a sea change. It brought Seleukos III's younger brother Antiochos to the throne, the
Antiochos who was to do so much to reconstitute the empire of Seleukos I.
Whether or not Euergetes chose to of fer financial suppor t to Hierax (or to Attalos
for that matter), there is no doubt that he continued his practice of subventions to
anti-Macedonian forces in the Balkans (perhaps on occasion even dispatching troops:
P.Haun. 6.18; Scholten 2000: 176). The subsidies to the Achaian League initially
negotiated by Aratos continued for some years, but the Ptolemies were equal oppor
tunity employers. When Kleomenes III, the most energetic king to rule Spar ta since
Areus, approached Egypt to talk about subsidies, Euergetes was open to discussion.
He was no doubt all the more open as the forces of containment working on
Macedon seemed to be weakening. After the death of Demetrios II in 229, the
throne was given (in trust for Demetrios' young son Philip) to Demetrios' cousin
Antigonos III Doson. In 227 Doson mounted a naval expedition to Karia in south
western Asia Minor (Trogus Prol. 28; Polyb. 20.5, 7±11; Crampa 1969). His motiv
ation in doing so remains mysterious ± perhaps a reasser tion of Macedonian naval
interests in the Aegean, perhaps a desire to fish in the troubled waters of an Asia
Minor wear y from Seleukid±Attalid conflict ± but in any case his success in Karia will
have been deeply troubling to Euergetes, who had interests in the same region and no
desire to see Macedonian naval power anywhere near the Ptolemaic sphere.
Also troubling to Euergetes was the behaviour of his old friends the Achaians. Not
only had they failed to prevent this display of Antigonid maritime ambition, they were
now wavering in their loyalty to anti-Macedonian sentiment. Alarm at the indefatig
able energies of the Spar tan Kleomenes had prompted an Achaian approach to
Macedon in 227/6; news of these negotiations was cer tain to sound Ptolemaic
alarm bells (Polyb. 2.48±50). Kleomenes began to look like the better risk, and
Euergetes, probably in the winter of 226/5, withdrew his financial suppor t from
the Achaian League and began to for ward it instead to Kleomenes (Polyb. 4.51).
Kleomenes responded gratefully and without subtlety to the subventions with a issue
of coins bearing the Ptolemaic eagle (Mùrkholm 1991: 149).
But the Ptolemies, if generous, could be erratic suppor ters (as the Achaians had
already discovered). Egypt's motivation was not altruistic, in spite of the claims of the
Chremonides decree; it was driven by a calculated self-interest, exemplified by Euer
getes' demand in 224 that Kleomenes render up his mother and his children to be
detained in Alexandria as hostages for his good behaviour (Plut. Cleom. 22). When
Doson and the Achaians ± as was surely now inevitable ± concluded an alliance in
224, and when other Greeks subsequently joined in a coalition against Kleomenes,
46 Sheila L. Ager



Euergetes saw no sense in continuing to bet on a lost cause. Ten days before the
battle at Sellasia in July 222, he sent a message telling Kleomenes that he was
withdrawing his suppor t and recommending that the Spar tan king make the best
peace he could. Kleomenes fought the battle anyway ± committed to the restoration
of the antique Spar ta and ever ything it stood for, he had little choice ± and went
down to defeat.
Ptolemy III Euergetes, Antigonos III Doson, and Seleukos III were all of dif ferent
generations, but their deaths were closely contemporar y. Seleukos III was murdered
in 223, and Euergetes was dead by Febr uar y 221; Doson died in midsummer of the
same year. In all three kingdoms, youthful ± and unseasoned ± kings now came to the
throne.
5 Succession (Melo)Drama: the Young Kings and their Villainous
Advisors
Polybios asser ts that this moment ± the accession of Philip V in Macedon, Ptolemy IV
Philopator in Egypt, and Antiochos III in Asia ± was a watershed in world histor y
(4.2). The `balance' that had existed in the previous decades was about to shift
dramatically, and fur thermore, the Romans were about to step onto the Hellenistic
stage. Of the new monarchs, two, in Polybios' view, had more talent than their
predecessors had shown in some time, while one was not only depraved, but useless.
Drawing on Polybios' judgement, Justin puts it succinctly:
These boy-kings had no men of riper years to guide them, but in their enthusiasm to
follow in the steps of their forefathers, they all revealed great natural abilities. The sole
exception was Ptolemy; villainous in seizing his realm, he was also inef ficient in adminis
tering it. (29.1.8±9; Yardley trans.)
It is dif ficult to liberate ourselves from this view and the notion that Ptolemy IV was a
weak and vicious liber tine who single-handedly sank the power that Ptolemaic Egypt
had been during the third centur y. And yet Ptolemy IV did manage to retain (more or
less) the external possessions he had inherited from his father; the native uprisings
that occurred in Egypt during his reign had not only been attested before, but may in
some measure be attributable to the oppressive economic measures instituted not by
himself, but by his grandfather (Huss 1976; Turner 1984; HÈ o lbl 2001: 63, 153).
There is a suspicious str uctural similarity in Polybios' accounts of the early years of
the three kings. All three are initially subjected to the conflicting pressures of a wicked
and a wise advisor, a model for which the historiographic locus classicus is Herodotos'
account of the young king Xer xes. Antiochos and Philip successfully rid themselves of
their villainous Rasputins, but Ptolemy IV never did (Polybios' answer, of course, to
the problem of Ptolemaic decline). During the Social War of 220±217, when Philip
and his new Achaian allies finally embarked on open war fare with the Aitolian League
(for decades a crotchety neighbour of both the Achaians and Macedon), one Apelles,
`who had the most influence with the king', concocted a conspiracy to discredit the
Achaian Aratos and to damage Philip's prospects in the war. Before the war was over,
Philip had seen the light and disposed of Apelles' group through execution and
enforced suicide (Polyb. 4.76, 82±7; 5.1±28). As for Antiochos III, he had inherited
From the Death of Seleukos to the Battle of Raphia 47



a kingdom with a basic structural weakness, and a histor y of secession and internecine
strife. Upon his accession more of the upper satrapies fell away in revolt: Molon in
Media and his brother Alexander in Persia rebelled against Seleukid authority (222;
Polyb. 5.40±56). Vicious in himself, Antiochos' chief advisor Hermeias also appears
to have given the young king bad advice, persuading him to embark on a campaign
against Ptolemaic holdings in Syria rather than against Molon (221). The Syrian
campaign failed utterly, while Molon's affairs prospered. In the end Antiochos was
forced to deal with Molon himself; the rebellion was successfully put down, and
Molon committed suicide (220). By now, Antiochos was suspicious of Hermeias, and
had him quietly done away with.
Ptolemy IV was unfor tunate enough to have a similarly evildaimon in the person of
Sosibios, and doubly unfortunate in that he was in himself too inept to cope without
his advisor. Polybios gives us an object lesson in Sosibios' nefarious dealings with the
Spar tan Kleomenes, in exile in Alexandria after the disaster at Sellasia. Using the same
techniques as Hermeias (the ever-useful if slightly tired device of the forged letter),
Sosibios destroys Kleomenes, allowing Polybios to record an epitaph of a man `by
nature most commanding and kingly' (Polyb. 5.39.6, who had had few kind words
for Kleomenes so long as he was an enemy of Achaia). The weakness, however, of
Polybios' por trait of Sosibios ± and this perhaps is why the real Ptolemy IV did not
divest himself of the real Sosibios ± is that unlike Apelles or Hermeias, Sosibios, far
from harming the king's cause, saved it during the Four th Syrian War.
In 219, Antiochos was ready to make an attempt on Syria again. He may well have
been provoked by his misgivings about the relationship between Ptolemaic Egypt and
his cousin Achaios, who had been operating with great success against Attalos in Asia
Minor in recent years. Already under suspicion, in 220 Achaios put on the diadem
and proclaimed himself king in Asia Minor (Polyb. 5.57.5). We have no ironclad
proof that Ptolemy was suppor ting him in his venture, though it would admittedly be
a Ptolemaic sor t of thing to do. The chief Seleukid achievement in the Four th Syrian
War (219±217) was Antiochos' recover y of the por t city of Seleukeia. Although he
scored militar y successes in the Ptolemaic province, he was stalled by the machin
ations of Ptolemy's ministers Sosibios and Agathokles, who persuaded him to agree
to a four-month truce in which to negotiate. The negotiations gave Egypt enough
time to train an army that included, for the first time, 20,000 native Egyptians armed
as hoplites (Polyb. 5.63±7). When the two armies met on the battlefield near Raphia
(June 22, 217), the Ptolemaic forces defeated Antiochos' troops, and the Seleukid
king was forced to give up his Syrian ambitions ± for the present.
Polybios remarks that it was an enormous mistake in the long run to enlist the
Egyptian troops (he thus manages to belie neatly the real success of Ptolemy IV and
Sosibios at Raphia). Until now, the Macedonian rulers of Egypt had eschewed the use
of native troops, contemptuous of their unwarlike character in much the same way as
the British of the colonial era were (the Egyptian peasant `would make an admirable
soldier', writes a British field marshal in the 1910 Encyclopedia Britannica, `if only he
wished to kill some one!'). But emboldened now by their success at Raphia, and filled
with nationalist fer vour, the Egyptians rebelled against their foreign masters ±
`immediately', Polybios says (5.107.1), though he seems to be telescoping events
which took place much later in Philopator's reign (McGing 1997). It was this
upsurge in the native Egyptian movement for independence, combined with Ptolemy
48 Sheila L. Ager



IV's character being `rather too much inclined for peace' (5.87.3), that Polybios saw
as disastrous for the future of the Ptolemaic empire.
Philopator's peaceful inclinations were on display in Greece as well, where his
ambassadors attempted to mediate a settlement to the Social War between Philip
and the Aitolians (Polyb. 5.100). What contribution the Ptolemaic envoys made to
the Peace of Naupaktos is dif ficult to determine. Polybios claims that what really
prompted Philip to make peace in the late summer of 217 was the news of the recent
victor y of Hannibal at Lake Trasimene and the world of oppor tunity opened up by
the Roman defeat there (5.101±2). Whether Polybios' essay at mind-reading is right
or wrong, it is tr ue that the Roman world was soon to intr ude itself more and more
into the consciousness of the eastern Mediterranean, till now so dominated by
Ptolemies, Seleukids, and Antigonids.
6 Conclusion: a `Balance of Power'?
The phrase `balance of power' repeatedly appears in discussions of the third centur y
BC
, generally with a disclaimer. The asser tion that the Ptolemaic, Seleukid, or Anti
gonid kings consciously aimed at merely limited power out of an ideological sense
that a triangulated balance of strong kingdoms would produce a world that was
healthiest and happiest for ever yone is a precarious one (though H È o lbl has recently
claimed to see in the settlement at the end of the Four th Syrian War `the consummate
statecraft of the Ptolemies and their long-term policy of a balance of power' [2001:
131]). F. W. Walbank, in a discussion of Antigonid sea power, states the qualified view
well: `the three major monarchies in practice operated a balance of power which,
however, was never accepted in principle' (Walbank 1982: 234). Walbank's view is
that the Antigonids in the naval realm were not being purely defensive, but rather
were actively pursuing aggressive expansionism ± they just weren't ver y good at it.
And that may well be the whole stor y of Hellenistic `balance of power' in a nutshell.
Because the Ptolemies never controlled the entire Aegean or all of Asia Minor (and
because of the claims of Polybios) we have the sense that Ptolemaic imperialism was
purely `defensive', and that it was all the result of tidy planning. But this is a view
based to a large extent on hindsight. Just because Euergetes' wild adventure in the
hear t of the Seleukid empire in 246/5 had little lasting ef fect does not mean that he
never thought it might. The fragility of the balance is par ticularly well illustrated by
that episode. The claim that Ptolemaic foreign policy was defensive in its nature, and
that the Ptolemies accepted the principle of limited power, inevitably tends to soften
our estimation of their imperialism. Yet any imperial power can claim ± and even
sincerely believe ± that its expansionism is based on the needs of security and defence.
`It may have been wrong to take this empire,' says Perikles in fifth-centur y Athens,
`but it would be dangerous to give it up' (Thuc. 2.63.2).
Viewed from the perspective of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the third centur y, far
from being a time of stability and equilibrium, was a time of great turmoil and often
anguish. This chapter has focused almost exclusively on matters of war. The Hellen
istic kings were all the descendants of a war rior culture, and their power and their
kingship were measured by their arms. This period demonstrates to per fection that
the Hellenistic world was always a fluid and dynamic one, and that the eastern
Mediterranean was never in these years the settled, stable place it came to be under
From the Death of Seleukos to the Battle of Raphia 49



the Roman empire. The balance of the third centur y, if there was one, was of a
Herakleitan rather than a Pythagorean character, based not on harmony, but on
tension and strife.
FURTHER READING
It has been remarked many times in the course of this chapter that the third centur y is
one of the most challenging in all of ancient histor y in terms of primar y source
materials. Any day we may find another Gourob Papyr us or another Adoulis inscrip
tion, another Chremonides decree or another P.Haun. 6. If and when we do, all our
assumptions will have to be revisited, from the finest details to the broadest conclu
sions. Impor tant re-examinations of some of the most significant documents may be
found in Bu È low-Jacobsen 1979, Piejko 1990, 1991 and C. Jones 1993.
Will 1979±1982 remains the best broad sur vey of the political/militar y histor y of
the Hellenistic world, though it now stands in need of updating; it is especially useful
for the collation and discussion of primar y sources. In English, the second edition of
the Cambridge Ancient Histor y (Vol. 7.1, 1984, covering the Hellenistic period from
323 to 217) of fers a number of impor tant essays. More recent syntheses (Green 1990
or Shipley 2000) are valuable, although their added emphasis on social and cultural
histor y inevitably cur tails the discussions of political narrative. Specialized studies of
the individual Hellenistic kingdoms include Hammond and Walbank's Histor y of
Macedonia iii (1988), dealing with the years between 336 and 167; Sher win-White
and Kuhr t's From Samarkhand to Sardis (1993), a somewhat idiosyncratic, but
commendable study of the Seleukid kingdom; and HÈ o lbl's Histor y of the Ptolemaic
Empire (2001) and Huss's A
È
gypten in hellenistischer Zeit (2001).
Much of the debate and discussion of the tangled web of third centur y histor y is to
be found in specialized monographs and ar ticles. They are too many to list here in
their entirety, but following are a few examples. Most are not unnaturally concerned
with reconstr uction of the militar y str uggles of the period. For perspectives on the
Syrian conflicts: Lor ton 1971, JÈ ahne 1974, Huss 1977, 1978, Bresciani 1978,

of Merker 1970, Buraselis 1982, Reger 1985, 1994c, and much of Bagnall 1976. For
a new evaluation of Ptolemaic activity in the Aegean, and of the Ptolemaic monarchy
in general, Hazzard 2000 should be consulted. Hazzard also discusses the perpetually
intriguing Arsinoe II, as do Burstein 1982, Carney 1994, and Quaegebeur 1998; her

CHAPTER FOUR
The Arrival of Rome:
from the Illyrian Wars to the
Fall of Macedon
Peter Derow
This stor y might begin in many places. For Polybios it all star ted with the First Illyrian
War (229±28). On his account this was Rome's `first crossing with militar y force into
Illyria and these par ts of Europe, as well as the first diplomatic involvement with
places in Greece' (2.12.7). The second par t of this statement is incorrect, or at least
misleading, but about the first there is no question. This was indeed the first
appearance of Roman arms and warships across the Adriatic, and this war and its
aftermath created a situation that can rightly be said to have been the beginning of the
process known as the Roman conquest of Greece. Over the next sixty years there
followed a series of actions and reactions by Romans and by Greeks. At ever y stage a
new situation was created as people responded to changing circumstances. But there
was a kind of continuity, too, and after those two generations the fell sway of
Rome had increased and been af firmed, to the point that there was nothing left but
`to give heed to the Romans and obey them in their orders' (Polyb. 3.4.3, writing of
the time after the eradication of the Macedonian monarchy in 167). Players on both
sides contributed to this outcome.
1 The Adriatic
There had been Illyrians and there had been piracy in this sea long before the 230s.
What there had not been was a strong Illyrian state such as emerged in this decade
under the leadership of Agron, king of the Ardiaioi, continued after Agron's death at
the end of the decade by Queen Teuta, his wife. Piracy became more insistent, and,
more impor tant, Agron began to extend his political dominion southwards and to
more Greek places. The Achaian and Aitolian Leagues were unable to stop him from
gaining a foothold at Phoinike in Epeiros. To the nor th, the Greeks of Pharos were
already under his control, but the Greeks of Issa still held out. For Polybios it was
complaints about Illyrian piracy, lodged before the Senate by Italians, that prompted
the Romans to send an embassy in 230 to Teuta. For Appian, whose account is to be



given at least as much weight, it was a plea from the Greeks of Issa that elicited the
Roman de Â marche. For both, it was the murder of a Roman ambassador that led to
the Roman declaration of war. But there was more to it than this, for neither provides
a satisfactor y explanation of this level of Roman concern with Adriatic af fairs.
The answer lies on the western shores of the Adriatic and in a development of much
longer standing than the rise of the Ardiaioi. After the battle of Sentinum in 295
Roman dominion in Italy was extended across the peninsula to the Adriatic. This was
quickly confirmed by the foundation of colonies on the coast in the 280s: Sena
Gallica, Hadria and Castrum Novum. They were the beginning of a process that
continued with the foundations of Ariminum (268), Firmum Picenum (264), and,
finally, Brundisium (244). These were citizen and Latin colonies, and it was above all
the sea that connected them to the wider world. It is against this backdrop of fifty
years of Roman presence along the Adriatic coast that the events of the 230s must be
seen and understood: by then Adriatic af fairs were altogether relevant to Rome's
dominion in Italy. And the impor tance of the nor thern Adriatic for Rome in the 230s

was more than a little enhanced by the quest for territor y and control in the Po Valley
in which the Romans were then engaged.
It made sense for Italians sailing in the Adriatic to appeal to Rome against the
depredations of Illyrian pirates (Polyb. 2.8.2; one must wonder to what extent these
were from the coastal colonies of Italy). It made sense for the Greeks of Issa to turn
their attention in the same direction (App. Ill. 7). The Adriatic was visibly in part a
Roman sea, and already a few years before this some Akarnanians had appealed to
Rome (Just. 28.1±2; on the historicity, but relative inconsequentiality, of this, Dany
1999: 98±119). The Senate took cognizance. Roman ambassadors were sent to the
Illyrian monarch in the company of the envoys from Issa. They were set upon by
pirates, and one Roman, Coruncanius, and the Issaian Kleemporos were killed
(whether before or after an inter view with Queen Teuta is unclear; Appian's version,
that there was no inter view, seems preferable: Derow 1973a; cf. Errington 1989a:
86±8). The result was war. Both consuls of 229 were sent across the Adriatic, with
fleet and two consular armies (the usual expeditionar y force at the time).
The war was short. Both consuls triumphed, thereby establishing the world to the
east of Italy as one where triumphs might be gained. Even more consequential for the
histor y of Greece was the immediate aftermath of the war. In the course of it, a
number of Greek cities and some inland tribes surrendered themselves to the
Romans. Whether some or all of them became allies of Rome in some formal sense,
or whether they entered into a vaguer kind of `friendship and alliance' with the victors
is disputed (for alliance, especially in the case of Pharos, see Derow 1991; BD 31, but
also Eckstein 1999; fur ther on formal relations of Rome and Greek states: Hammond
and Walbank 1988: 601±10). Roman envoys were sent to the unsuccessful opponents
of the Illyrians, the Achaian and Aitolian Leagues (in 228 by the consul who wintered
in Greece), and also to Athens and to Corinth (in 227 by the Senate). They por trayed
Rome's inter vention as a ser vice to Greeks, and repor t has it that the Romans (or
perhaps just the Roman envoys?) were admitted to the Isthmian Games at Corinth
and into citizenship and the Eleusinian Mysteries at Athens. The Romans had arrived.
The ships and the soldiers left, but Roman interest in the area remained.
During the next few years Roman pre-eminence in the Adriatic and on the shores
of Illyria and nor th-western Greece was challenged by Demetrios of Pharos. Agron's
erstwhile lieutenant, he had fallen afoul of Queen Teuta, signalled his availability to
the Romans before they arrived and handed over to them Pharos and Kerkyra which
he controlled. From the Romans he received no great reward for this (App. Ill. 8;
Polybios' asser tion, 2.11, that they granted him much is surely a construction
designed to demonstrate ingratitude on Demetrios' par t) and soon set about improv
ing his situation. He allied himself with Antigonos Doson, with whom he fought at
Sellasia (222), and made common cause with Istrian pirates in the nor th. By the end
of the decade he had detached people and places from their Roman connection and
was attacking cities Polybios describes as `subject to the Romans' (3.16: whether
of ficially allies or friends, this is how they were perceived, a perception explicitly
shared by Philip V of Macedon: Polyb. 7.9.13).
For some years the Romans did nothing about this. Indif ference is not the explan
ation. As early as 226 they were deeply concerned about the Gauls in and around the
Po Valley and the hostile reaction of the Gauls to Roman settlement in that area
(Polyb. 2.13); this was not resolved until Marcellus' great victor y at Clastidium in
From the Illyrian Wars to the Fall of Macedon 53



222. In 221 both consuls were sent against the Istrians, Demetrios' par tners (Eutrop.
3.7; cf. Dell 1970), and the consuls of 220 led an expedition `as far as the Alps'
(Zonar. 8.20: which Alps, and whether this had to do with the sequelae of the Gallic
conflict or with the Istrians, we do not know). Demetrios would be next, and so he
was, in 219, when both consuls were again sent to Illyria. The inevitability of this
must help to explain Demetrios' other wise bizarrely provocative conduct in 220: he
was preparing for the inevitable Roman attack. He had to do so on his own: Doson
had died, and the young Philip V who succeeded him was becoming embroiled in the
Social War. This second Illyrian War was even shorter than the first. Both consuls
triumphed. Illyria and the Adriatic had been disrupted and Roman authority chal
lenged. The Romans set things back to rights at the earliest oppor tunity, when free of
the more pressing task as was always their way. Demetrios fled to the young king
Philip and took refuge at his cour t.
2 Macedon
It is unlikely that the Romans had much interest in Macedon before this (despite
Polyb. 3.16 and Holleaux 1928), but they were not unaware of Demetrios' presence
at Philip's cour t. In 217 an embassy was sent to Philip requesting the surrender of
Demetrios (Livy 22.33.3). This was the first contact between the two states. Deme
trios was not surrendered, and the Romans were of course not in a position to do
anything about it: they were at war with Car thage and Hannibal was in Italy. For
Philip, on the other hand, Rome's preoccupation provided oppor tunity, and his own
preoccupation with the Social War came to an end with the Peace of Naupaktos in
September 217.
The idea that the oppor tunity perceived by Philip included thoughts of universal
dominion derives only from Polybios' exorbitant ascription to the king of Alexander
like aims (5.101±2; Philip was of course not related to Alexander, and Polybios'
romantic account of Philip's reception of the news of Trasimene raises all manner
of dif ficulties, not least chronological: see Derow 1976: 276 n. 36) and Livy's even
more exorbitant rendition of the alliance struck in 215 between Philip and Hannibal
(23.33). Polybios gives us the document (7.9). Detailed provisions for militar y co
operation are absent. What we do have is the provision that the Romans were no
longer `to be masters (kyrioi) of Kerkyra, Apollonia, Epidamnos, Pharos, Dimale, the
Par thinoi or Atintania' (7.9.13): Philip's aim was to remove Roman authority from
the eastern shore of the Adriatic. He built ships in the winter of 217/6, but the
Adriatic expedition of summer 216 was abor ted. Then came the alliance with Hanni
bal and, in 214, a seaborne attack on Orikos near Apollonia. But the Romans had
learned of the link between Hannibal and Philip and, accordingly, of Philip's Adriatic
designs. A fleet was sent to Orikos. Philip was forced to burn his ships and to retreat
home overland. So had begun the so-called `First Macedonian War'. The conflict was
not notable for battles between Roman and Macedonian forces, for it included none
of these, and it was not in any sense resolved by the Peace of Phoinike that brought it
to a halt in 205. Its significance was other wise.
After abandoning any naval pretensions in the west, Philip operated by land, and he
was successful, gaining control of the Adriatic por t of Lissos in 213. This created a
problem for the Romans. To commit a small fleet to the region was one thing, to
54 Peter Derow



commit a land ar my was someth ing else again. An ally in Greece was needed, and o ne
was fo und in the Aitol ian League . T o judge from Livy's account (25 .23) it seems that
the Rom ans had been ang ling for the su ppor t of the Aitolians fo r a time before the
allian ce was str uck in 211. T o judg e from the Polybi an record (9.37 ), it was the
Aitolians who dragged the Rom ans into a Gre ek con flict. This like ly reflec ts a
dif ference of emph asis rather than of fact. The Aitolians were happy to take advantag e
of Philip' s Roman concer ns in order to re-op en the q uestions of the Socia l War that
the Peace of Naupakt os had not really resolv ed and to ex tend the ir own auth ority
at the exp ense of Macedon; the Romans n eeded a land-bas ed ally in their conflict
with Philip. Each had their own reasons for maki ng common cause with the other
against Philip, and this is nowh ere cleare r than in the allian ce itse lf, of whi ch par t is
preser ved on stone ( SV III.536; trans. BD 33, Sherk 2; cf. Livy 26.2 4). What su r vives
seems to begin with the statem ent that the A itolians ar e to make war o n Philip and his
allies (the list of the latter may b e filled in from Polyb. 9.38 .5 and 11.5 .4: Epeirote s,
Achaians, Akar nanians, Boioti ans, Thessali ans, Euboians, Phokians , Lokrian s). It
cont inues:
If the Romans take by force any of these peoples, let it be per mitted, as far as concer ns
the demos (people) of the Romans, for the demos of the Aitolians to have these cities and
lands; whatever (the) Romans take besides the city and land, let (the) Romans have. If
Romans and Aitolians together take any of these cities, let it be per mitted, as far as
concer ns the demos (of the Romans) for the Aitolians to have these cities and lands;
whatever they take besides the city , let it belong to both together . If any of these cities go
over to, or sur render to, the Romans or the Aitolians, [let it be per mitted, as far as
concer ns the] demos of the Romans, for the Aitolians to takes these people and the cities
and the lands [into their] state . . .
Philip, and especi ally his allies, will be the object of a Roman±Ait olian war . The
Aitolians will gai n ter ritor y and booty . T he Romans will gai n from Philip 's occup ation
with the war and indee d from booty as we ll: the profi t from enslavemen t in par ticular
must have bee n su bstantial . The new allies began their co-op eration in A kar nania,
taking cities and enslaving populati ons. That set the patter n for the conf lict over the
next few yea rs, a nd Phi lip could only attem pt heroic ally to defend his allies. It was the
Socia l War all ove r aga in, only much more vicious. The dif ferenc e was not lost on
Greeks of the time. A n Akar n anian env oy at Spar ta in 21 0, endeavou ring to dissuad e
the Spar tans from joini ng the Rom ans and Aitolians, asks the Aitol ian env oy `But who
makes common cause with you at pre sent or what kind of allian ce do you invite the m
(i.e. the Spar tans) to enter? Is it not an allian ce with barbarians? ' (Polyb. 9.37.5±6 )
The contra st with previo us Spar tan resist ance to the barbarians (in the for m of the
Persians ) is exp licitly drawn . After refer ring to more recen t Aitolian histor y , the
Akar nanian cont inues:
How , when one knows of this, can one help viewing with suspicion the advance of the
Romans and with detestation the unprincipled conduct of the Aetolians in venturing to
make such treaties? Already they have robbed the Akar nanians of Oiniadai and Nasos,
and it is but the other day that they together with the Romans seized on the unhappy city
of Antikyra, selling its inhabitants into slaver y . So the Romans are car r ying of f the women
and children to suf fer, of course, what those must suf fer who fall into the hands of aliens
From the Illyrian Wars to the Fall of Macedon 55



(allophyloi), while the Aitolians divide the houses of the unfortunate people among
themselves by lot. A fine alliance this for anyone to determine to join and specially for
you Lakedaimonians, who, when you conquered the barbarians, decreed that the
Thebans were to pay a tithe to the gods for having decided under compulsion, but
alone among the Greeks, to remain neutral during the Persian invasion. (Polyb. 9.39.1±
5, trans. Paton)
The Spar tans were deaf to these pleas. They joined the new alliance, as did the
Messenians around the same time. For both, the present Peloponnesian picture
was, we may judge, the more impor tant: the Achaian League was for them the greater
threat. Another adherent was Attalos I of Pergamon. He already had connections
with the Aitolian League, and he ver y soon became Rome's most influential ally in the
East (a position assumed after his death in 197 by his son Eumenes). The war went
on, and revulsion at the nature of its conduct grew apace. Nothing like this, with
populations being enslaved, had been seen in Greece for a long time (cf. Tarn and
Grif fith 1952: 80±2), nor had such `barbarians' and `aliens'.
The Social War had been widely seen in the Greek world as a dangerously inter
necine affair. A number of states, including Rhodes, Chios, Byzantion and Ptolemaic
Egypt tried to mediate a settlement of it (Polyb. 5.100). It had ended with the
Aitolian Agelaos of Naupaktos warning of `the clouds in the west' and the danger
they posed for Greeks (Polyb. 5.104). This recrudescence of the Social War elicited
more attempts at mediation from yet more people. The language of mediation is
infused with hostility to the Romans. It is informed also by a kind of panhellenism
and a related fear about the future. In an address to the Aitolians in 207 a Rhodian
speaker refers to numerous attempts by Ptolemy, Rhodes, Chios and Byzantion to
bring an end to the war. He begs them `as if the whole of the islanders and all the
Greeks who inhabit Asia Minor were present here and were entreating you to stop the
war and decide for peace ± for the matter concerns them as much as ourselves ± to
come to your senses and relent and agree to our request' (Polyb. 11.4.6). He
continues:
You say that you are fighting with Philip for the sake of the Greeks, that they may be
delivered and may refuse to obey his commands; but as a fact you are fighting for the
enslavement and ruin of Greece. This is the stor y your treaty with the Romans tells, a
treaty formerly existing merely in writing, but now seen to be carried out in actual fact.
Previously the words of the treaty involved you in disgrace, but now when it is put in
action this becomes evident to the eyes of all. Philip, then, is but the nominal pretext of
the war; he is in no kind of danger; but as he has for allies most of the Peloponnesians, the
Boiotians, the Phokians, the Lokrians, the Thessalians, and Epeirotes, you made
the treaty against them all, the terms being that their persons and personal proper ty
should belong to the Romans and their cities and lands to the Aitolians. Did you capture
a city yourselves you would not allow yourselves to outrage freeman or to burn their
towns, which you regard as a cruel proceeding and barbarous; but you have made a treaty
by which you have given up to the barbarians the rest of the Greeks to be exposed to
atrocious outrage and violence. This was not formerly understood, but now the case of
the people of Oreos and that of the unhappy Aiginetans have exposed you to all, Fortune
having of set purpose as it were mounted your infatuation on the stage. Such was the
beginning of this war, such are already its consequences, and what must we expect its end
56 Peter Derow



to be, if all falls out entirely as you wish? Surely the beginning of terrible disaster to all the
Greeks. (6) For it is only too evident, I think, that the Romans if they get the war in Italy
off their hands ± and this will be very shortly, as Hannibal is now confined in quite a small
district of Bruttium ± will next throw themselves with their whole strength on Grecian
lands on the pretext that they are helping the Aitolians against Philip, but really with the
intention of conquering the whole country. Should the Romans when they have sub
jected us, determine to treat us kindly, the credit and thanks will be theirs; but if they treat
us ill it is they who will acquire the spoil of those they destroy and sovereignty over the
survivors, and you will then call the gods to witness then neither any god will be still
willing, nor any man still able to help you. (11.5±6.4, trans. Paton; cf. already 10.25 for
similar fear about the future)
Evidence for this resurgent panhellenism is found not only in speeches reported by
Polybios (on which, see above all, Walbank 1965, esp. 248±9). At precisely the same
time as these sentiments were being uttered in Greece, something remarkable was
occurring at Magnesia-on-the-Maeander (for the epigraphical dossier from which
alone we know about this, Rigsby 1996: 179±279).
Some years before all this (in 221/20) the Magnesians, in response to an appear
ance of their patron deity, Artemis Leukophryene, had sought recognition for a
panhellenic festival in her honour and recognition of their city as sacred and inviol
able. The attempt failed for lack of support. They renewed it in 208/7. Envoys were
dispatched all over the Greek world, and this time they met with resounding success.
Favourable responses came from kings (Ptolemy IV, Attalos I, Antiochus III and his
son, and, implied in one text, Philip V), from Leagues (Boiotian, Aitolian, Akarna
nian, Epeirote, Phokian and Achaian), and from dozens of Greek cities throughout
the Mediterranean world (all of them, according to the Magnesian decree).
How much this concatenation of panhellenic (and anti-barbarian: anti-Roman, that
is) concern and sentiment affected the progress of the war in Greece must remain a
matter of conjecture. But there was clearly something in the air. In 206, after
concluding peace with Philip (see below) the Aitolians sponsored a wide-ranging
appeal from the Dorians of Kytinion for assistance in rebuilding their city, damaged
by earthquake in the early 220s and by years of warfare. Their appeal, known only
from an inscription from Xanthos in L ykia, was elaborately couched in terms of
shared hellenic ancestry (SEG 38.1476; cf. Hammond and Walbank 1988: 339;
Erskine 2001: 164±5).
In 207 and 206 the Romans contributed little support to their allies. Their great
success at the River Metaurus in 207 meant that Hannibal was effectively stranded in
the south of Italy, and they focused their attention on him. Attalos withdrew from the
conflict to deal with incursions by King Prusias of Bithynia. In 206 Philip, no longer
obliged to devote all his effort to the defence of his allies, forced the Aitolians to
negotiate a peace. The Romans, recent inactivity notwithstanding, appear to have
been willing to carry on the war. In 205 a sizeable force was sent to Epidamnos. Philip
came as far as the territory of Apollonia, but the Romans, having failed to draw the
Aitolians back into the war, did not go out to meet him. Epeirote mediators had no
trouble in persuading Philip to the negotiating table, and the Roman general,
Sempronius, did not demur. Peace was agreed at Phoinike in Epeiros in 205. Atinta
nia, attached to Rome since the first Illyrian war, was ceded to Philip, but there were
From the Illyrian Wars to the Fall of Macedon 57



no other ter ritori al adjust ments of any sign ificance; the pe ace ef fective ly re-est ab
lished the situa tion before the co nflict (Livy 29.12).
But if it made no concrete dif ference, the Peace of Phoinike redefined the political
constellat ion of Greece in the most striking way . On the o ne side was Philip , to whom
were added in the trea ty Pr usias, king of Bithy nia, the Ach aians, Boiotians , Thessal
ians, Akar nanians and Epeirote s. On the other side wer e now the Romans , to whom
were added the Ilians, King Attalos, Pleuratos , Nabis, tyrant of Spar ta, and the
Eleians, Me ssenians and A thenians. T wo things were c lear . One , that there were
now two sides in Greece : Philip and his allies on the one hand, the Roman s and
their allies on the other . Two, that the settleme nt was temporar y . About this Livy is
explicit: peace was vot ed at Rome `si nce, now that the war had shifted to Africa, they
wished for the present to be relieved of all other wars' (29.12.16; Derow 1979: 6±8).
Roman interest s in gen eral were not restri cted in the same way . In 205/4 it was
decided, in resp onse to omens and the advic e of the Sibylli ne books, to impor t the
cult of the Magna Mater to Rome. A team of illustrious env oys was sent to Pes sinous
in nor thw ester n Asia Mino r to fetc h the image of the deity . They were assisted in this
by Attalos, and `five quinquir emes were assig ned to the deputa tion so that in a
manner wor thy of the dignity o f the Roman peop le it might approac h lands where
it was desirabl e that the Roman name should win for itself the highest respect ' (Livy
29.11; Erskin e 2001: 205±1 8).
3 The Roman Conquest
For Rom e the next few years saw the final stag es of the war with Hannib al, whi ch
ended with the victor y of Scipio Africanus at Zama in Nor th A frica in 202 and the
peace impose d upo n C ar thage in 201, includ ing a hug e indemni ty of 10 ,000 talents .
This was to be pai d over the next 50 yea rs in yea rly instalme nts of 200 talents and is
better seen as an insist ence by Rome upon the subordinat ion o f Car thage than as a
serious quest for impe rial profi t. W ith the end of that conflict the Romans were
indeed relieved of all other serious con flicts (and this in a way they ha d not bee n for a
ver y long time). Phi lip in the me anwhile tur ned his attention most ly towards the
Aegean , wher e he found hims elf increa sing ly at odd s with Rhode s and King Attalos .
There was some cont act bet ween Macedon a nd Rome during this time . In 203 `allied
cities from Greece ' are repor ted to have appe aled to Rome against Mace donian
depreda tions (Liv y 3 0.26). The Romans took cogniz ance of this in a minor way .
Also rep or te d is a Maced onian cont ingent fighting alongs ide Hannib al at Zama, bu t
the fa ct that these troops do not appea r in Polybi os' account of the battle, on which
that of Livy is other wise c learly based, must indica te fabrication (Livy 30.3 3, Pol yb.
15.11). Philip had no reason to provoke Rom e, and the re is no other reason to think
that he did so.
Cer tain ly another conflict between Rom e and Macedon began in 200 , the so- called
second Mace donian war . Pol ybios' view , that the re was only one war betwe en Philip
and the Rom ans, which began with Philip's alliance with Hannib al and ende d with
the batt le o f Kyno skephalai in 197, is wor th taki ng ver y seriousl y (Polyb. 3.32;
cf. Derow 1979: 10±11; Polybi os' view finds an echo in Liv y (31.1 ) and later, more
striking ly , in Flor us (1.23), whose `first Mace donian war' embr aces what are now
convent ionally know n as the first and second) . It would seem that fo r Pol ybios, as
58 Peter Derow



for Livy's Romans (see section 2 above on 29.12.16), the Peace of Phoinike was not
seen as concluding the issue between Rome and Philip in any more than a ver y
temporar y way. Still, the conflict renewed in 200 was something quite dif ferent
than what had gone before: it is the circumstances and nature of this renewal that
invite attention.
In 201, when the Hannibalic war was finally ended, there arrived at Rome em
bassies from Attalos and the Rhodians and from the Aitolians (on the date of the
Aitolian embassy, see Derow 1979: 7±8). The latter complained of Philip's treatment
of them and appealed to the Romans to renew the old conflict. Attalos and the
Rhodians, who had been fighting Philip in the Aegean, sought Roman suppor t in
their conflict with Philip and against his expansionist campaigns. The Aitolian appeal
was rejected. This cannot be taken to indicate any lack of willingness on the par t of
Rome to engage with Philip: it was at just this time that they did decide to engage. It
must indicate something else, and evidently it indicates that the Romans had decided
not to engage with Philip in the way that they had done before. They were not
unaware of what had been said in Greece about them and their alliance with the
Aitolians (on which see section 2 above), and they were about to define themselves to
the Greeks in a wholly new way. The repor ts of Attalos and the Rhodians were taken
on board, and an embassy was despatched. For what it shows about this redefinition
and about the extent of Roman interest to the east, it is a most extraordinar y embassy.
The Roman envoys went to Athens, where they met with Attalos and the Rhodians in
early spring 200, and where Attalos made clear to the people of Athens the hostility of
the Romans (as well as his own and that of the Rhodians) towards Philip (Polyb.
16.25±6). Polybios goes on:
At the time that the Roman legates were present in Athens Nikanor, Philip's general,
overran Attika up to the Academy, upon which the Romans, after sending a herald to him
in the first place, met him and asked him to inform Philip that the Romans `called upon'
that king to make war on no Greek states and also to give such compensation to Attalos
for the injuries he had inflicted on him as a fair tribunal should pronounce to be just. If
he acted so, they added, he might consider himself at peace with Rome, but if he refused
to accede the consequences would be the reverse. Nikanor on hearing this depar ted. The
Romans had conveyed the contents of this communication to the Epeirotes at Phoinike
in sailing along that coast and to Amynander, going up to Athamania for that purpose.
They had also apprised the Aitolians at Naupaktos and the Achaians at Aigion. After
having made this statement to Philip through Nikanor they sailed away to meet Anti
ochos and Ptolemy for the purpose of arranging a settlement. (trans. Paton)
Philip is presented with an ultimatum which takes the form of a Roman order. It is an
ultimatum to which he could not possibly accede, at least not without acknowledging
Roman dominion in place of his own. This is the first time that the syndrome of
orders and obedience, which will characterize and indeed define Rome's imperium
for some time to come, appears on the hellenic stage (on this syndrome, Derow 1979:
5±6). Whatever were the niceties of Roman fetial procedure at the outset of this war
(on the basis of which the people voted for war against Philip `on account of arms
borne against and injuries done to allies of the Roman people', Livy 31.6), this
ultimatum had nothing to do with them. It was a clear declaration of intent by
Rome to occupy the central position in Greek af fairs. And it was, of course, wonder ful

propaganda: a declaration that the Romans were no longer the `barbarians' they had
been not long before but instead the protectors of Greeks. Philip becomes the villain.
As well as to Philip (to whom the ultimatum was delivered in person at Abydos later
in 201: Polyb. 16.34; by that time Roman forces were landing in Greece), the
message was conveyed to other Greeks, all of whom are allied or connected with
Philip. This group includes, pointedly, the Aitolian League: this is indeed the new
Rome. And the new Rome has a ver y wide pur view indeed. The Roman embassy was
to travel also to Antiochos III and Ptolemy V, who were engaged in the Fifth Syrian
War, to bring about a settlement between them. That the request for this inter vention
came from Ptolemy, whose father had helped the Romans during the Hannibalic war
with a subvention of grain (Polyb. 9.11a) and who appears to have solicited Rome's
help (Polyb. 15.25), is most likely. Cer tainly it was Antiochos who was winning the
war against Ptolemy: the Roman de Â marche can only have been to the latter's benefit.
This was the first contact between Rome and the Seleukid king.
In Greece, the Roman war was initially entrusted to P. Sulpicius Galba, consul of
200. He had been consul in 211 and as proconsul had conducted most of the earlier
war: the old Rome had not been entirely eclipsed. Little progress was made, and the
Aitolians were received back on side. (On what (if any) formal terms the Aitolians
renewed their Roman connection will remain a serious question.) He was succeeded
by P. Villius Tappulus, consul of 199, who spent little time in Greece (and most of
that dealing with a mutiny of Roman soldiers), before being succeeded by T. Quinc
tius Flamininus, consul of 198, who arrived in Greece early in his consular year. It was
Flamininus (on whose background, Badian 1971), who completed the redefinition of
Rome for the Greeks. His diplomatic achievements were many, the most significant
amongst them being to secure the alliance of the Achaian League, prominent now
under the leadership of Philopoimen. This was accomplished in 198 by the able
diplomacy of his brother Lucius (who promised Corinth to the Achaians: see
below), aided in no small way by the presence at Corinth of a Roman fleet trained
on the nor thern Peloponnese. Even so, the Achaian decision to abandon Philip for
Rome was a close run thing. The League was riven on the question of Rome, and it
remained so for the rest of its life.
The adherence of the Achaians enabled Flamininus to put himself at the head of a
group of allies. Polybios' account of a meeting between Flamininus and these allies
(including Amynander of Athamania and representatives of King Attalos, the
Achaians, Rhodians, Aitolians and Athenians) and Philip (accompanied by a Boiotian
and an exiled Achaian opponent of the alliance with Rome) in the winter of 198/97
shows that the interests of Rome's allies were to be represented; it shows also how all
essential decisions were to remain with Flamininus and Rome (Polyb. 18.1±12). On
this occasion ambassadors from Philip and from Flamininus and the allies went to
Rome, notionally with an eye to negotiating an end to the war. Philip's envoys were
surprised by a question about the king's continued occupation of the `fetters of
Greece' (Chalkis, Demetrias and the Acrocorinth; how they could not have been
expecting this is another serious question). With this comes the first secure mention
of the idea of the `freedom of the Greeks' in this context. The idea went back a long
way (cf. Gruen 1984: 132±57). The chief contemporar y exponent of liberation was
Antiochos III (most notably during his sojourn in southwestern Asia Minor in 204±
202, where he also sponsored an extensive, and successful, campaign by the Teians for
60 Peter Derow



recognition of their city as sacred and inviolable: known only from inscriptions,
Rigsby 1996: 280±325). At Rome the negotiations foundered, as no doubt they
were intended to do. Flamininus' allies, both Roman and (perhaps unwitting) Greek,
secured the continuation of the war and of Flamininus' command. The war came to
an end in 197 when Roman and Macedonian armies chanced upon one another at
Kynoskephalai in Thessaly. A battle was fought on ground much better suited to the
flexible Roman legion than to the Macedonian phalanx. Philip was defeated and
obliged to sue for peace.
There was uncer tainty in Greece about the nature of the settlement that would
come. In Boiotia a hint might have been seen in Flamininus' connivance in the
murder of the pro-Macedonian boiotarch Brachylles: the Roman was anxious to
gain the adherence of the Boiotians `because he was looking ahead to Antiochos'
(Polyb. 18.43). For public consumption the ten Roman commissioners, dispatched
to assist Flamininus in the settlement of Greece, brought with them a decree of the
Senate about the peace with Philip. The main points were:
All the rest of the Greeks in Asia and Europe were to be free and subject to their own
laws; Philip was to surrender to the Romans before the Isthmian Games [summer 196]
those Greeks subject to his rule and the cities in which he had garrisons; he was to leave
free, withdrawing his garrisons from them, the towns of Euromos, Pedasa, Bargylia and
Iasos, as well as Abydos, Thasos, Myrina and Perinthos; Flamininus was to write to
Prusias in the terms of the Senate's decree about restoring the freedom of Kios. . . . [Phi
lip was to pay the Romans] a thousand talents, half at once and the other half by
instalments extending over ten years. (Polyb. 18.44, trans. Paton)
The most striking thing here is, of course, the extension of the Roman order to cover
Asia Minor, where Antiochos was at the time af firming and seeking to increase his
dominion (on this dominion and its nature, Ma 1999). In Greece there was wide
spread approbation. The Aitolians, however, angr y at Flamininus' refusal to give them
credit for their par t in the victor y over Philip or proper reward for their par ticipation
in the war, obser ved that the fetters of Greece were being taken over by the Romans
and that what was happening was a change of masters for the Greeks and not
liberation (Polyb. 18.45.6). There were those who believed them. There was also
uncer tainty on the Roman side about the fetters, and Flamininus needed his best
diplomatic skills in dealing with the ten Roman commissioners:
[He pointed out to them] that if they wished to gain unmixed renown amongst the
Greeks and in general convince all that the Romans had originally crossed over not in
their own interest but in that the liber ty of Greece, they must withdraw from ever y place
and set free all the cities now garrisoned by Philip. The hesitation felt in the conference
was due to the fact that, while a decision had been reached in Rome about all other ques
tions, and the commissioners had definite instructions from the Senate on all other
matters, the question of Chalkis, Corinth and Demetrias had been left to their discretion
on account of Antiochos, in order that with an eye to circumstances they should take any
course on which they determined. . . . Flamininus persuaded his colleagues to set Corinth
free at once, handing it over to the Achaians, as had originally been agreed, while he
remained in occupation of the Acrocorinth, Demetrias and Chalkis. (Polyb. 18.45.9±12,
trans. Paton)
From the Illyrian Wars to the Fall of Macedon 61



The question was, evidently, one of how best to deal with Antiochos. For some (led,
one imagines, by the senior commissioner, P. Sulpicius Galba) it was to maintain
militar y strongholds in Greece. For Flamininus it was to gain the goodwill of as many
Greeks as possible by doing the opposite. Flamininus carried the day. At the Isthmian
Games in the summer of 196, the Roman herald proclaimed that the Greeks of Greece
who had been under Philip's control (they were named) would be free, free from
garrison and tribute, and governed by their own laws. (The list included the Corinth
ians, the Euboians and the Magnesians of nor thern Greece, in whose territories lay the
three fetters, Acrocorinth, Chalkis and Demetrias, which, in the event, the Romans
held garrisoned for another two years, thereby adding fur ther fuel to the Aitolians
claims, which Flamininus was still tr ying to defuse in 194: RDGE 33; trans. BD 36,
Sherk 4.) The crowd received the announcement with thunderous enthusiasm.
After the games the Roman commissioners turned to deal with envoys from
Antiochos. The message was clear and its tone even clearer:
They ordered him, as regards the cities of Asia, to keep his hands of f those which were
autonomous and make war on none of them and to withdraw from those previously
subject to Ptolemy and Philip which he had recently taken. At the same time they
enjoined him not to cross to Europe with an army, for none of the Greeks were any
longer being attacked by anyone or the subjects of anyone, and they announced in
general terms that some of their body would come to see Antiochos. (Polyb. 18.47,
trans. Paton)
The meeting happened at L ysimacheia on the European side of the Hellespont (once
a Seleukid possession and now recently reoccupied) later in the summer of 196. The
Roman demands were repeated. Antiochos had answers to them. About the autono
mous cities of Asia, Antiochos' reply was that `it was not proper for them to receive
their liber ty by order of the Romans, but by his own gracious favour' (Polyb. 18.51),
which reflects and reveals ver y nicely an essential dif ference between the natures of
Hellenistic monarchy and Roman imperium. The Romans went a step further in their
challenge to Antiochos' dominion and invited representatives from Smyrna and
Lampsakos to submit their disputes with Antiochos to them. Antiochos suggested
the Rhodians as arbitrators, and with that the meeting ended, but not the question of
Smyrna and Lampsakos. The Lampsakenes had themselves already been in contact
with Rome by way of an embassy in the winter of 197/6 (for all thisSIG
3 591; trans.
BD 35, Sherk 5). Referring to their kinship with Rome, through association with
Athena Ilias (on the impor tance of Troy in dealings between Greeks and Rome, see
Erskine 2001), they had sought from the Senate to be included in the peace that was
being made with Philip. Significantly, the Senate had granted this and promised to
protect them. Also significantly, the Lampsakene envoys, on their way to Rome, had
approached (and gained promises of protection from) Roman of ficers in Greece,
including Lucius Flamininus, in charge of the fleet, and a quaestor: the Lampsakenes
approached high-ranking Romans as they would have approached high-ranking
cour tiers of a hellenistic king. The Lampsakenes may be forgiven for dealing in the
only way they knew. What the Roman of ficials thought they were doing is another
question; the tendency of Roman of ficials to behave in such a plenipotentiar y way
would only increase.
62 Peter Derow



Flamininus and the Roman army remained in Greece. A reason for doing so was
found in the occupation of Argos by Nabis of Sparta (erstwhile ally of the Romans),
against whom Flamininus led his allies in a war of liberation. The business was soon
accomplished, and by 194 Flamininus was travelling about Greece arranging things.
An indication of Roman intentions may be found in his organization of Thessaly,
where power was put in the hands of the wealthy (Livy 34.51, not the only indication
of such Roman preference). In 194 he finally vacated the fetters and led the victorious
forces back to Rome for a magnificent triumph. Even before Flamininus' return
Scipio Africanus had been elected to the consulship as war with Antiochos was
envisaged at Rome (Livy 34.53).
Contact between Antiochos and Rome was renewed in the winter of 194/93 when
the king sent an embassy seeking friendship and alliance, and thereby normalization
of relations (Livy 34.57±9). The response was uncompromising: either Antiochos
stayed out of Europe or the Romans would extend their connections with cities in
Asia Minor. Antiochos' envoys had the power to agree to nothing of the kind. The
matter was postponed and the Senate dispatched an embassy to Antiochos.
On the same occasion, one of Antiochos' envoys laid before the Senate the request
of Teos for recognition of its city and territor y as inviolable (this had been sought
from Greek states a dozen years before: Rigsby 1996: 280±325). The Roman reply of
193 is preser ved on stone. The Teian request is granted, but in a par ticularly and
revealingly Roman way, both in the special relationship to the gods that is claimed
and, above all, in the conditional reference to the future at the end:
. . . And that we continue always to value most highly reverence towards the gods one
might best reckon from the favour with which we have for these reasons met from the
supernatural. We are convinced, moreover, that the special honour we show to the divine
has become thoroughly clear to all from many other things as well. Wherefore, for these
reasons and on account of our good-will towards you and on account of the esteemed
ambassador, it is our decision that your city and land are to be sacred, as is even now the
case, and inviolable and free from tribute at the hands of thedemos of the Romans, and we
shall tr y to increase both the honours to the god and our kindnesses to you, so long as you
maintain your good-will towards us even after this. (RDGE 34; trans. BD 39, Sherk 8)
As well as meeting with Antiochos, the Roman envoys toured widely. They
returned to Rome in the spring of 192 and repor ted that there was `no sufficiently
ripe cause for war' against anyone except Nabis of Spar ta (Livy 35.22), who had
occupied coastal towns in Lakonia in contravention of the Roman settlement. A force
was dispatched against Nabis. The absence of a suf ficiently ripe cause for war against
Antiochos did not prevent the Romans from preparing for war against him. Both
consuls of 192 had been held in readiness for that. An army and fleet were made ready
for one of the consuls to be elected for 191, and in the summer of 192 a force under
the praetor Baebius (whose province had been changed from Spain) was sent to
mainland Greece (see Livy 35 for Roman dispositions during 192).
In the autumn of 192 two things happened almost simultaneously. Well into
October Antiochos sailed with a small force to Demetrias. The Aitolians, whose
manoeuvres against Rome and (increasingly) in favour of Antiochos had continued
(Badian 1959), had prepared the way, and a mission led by Flamininus to shore up
From the Illyrian Wars to the Fall of Macedon 63



suppor t for Rome in Greece had failed in general, and in par ticular at Demetrias,
where the people believed they were to be handed over to Philip in return for his
suppor t of Rome against Antiochos. In early November Rome declared war against
Antiochos. (This happened at the beginning of the Roman consular year 191, but the
Roman calendar was then seriously out of joint with the solar year: Derow 1973b,
1976, with the small caveat noted at Walbank 1979a: vi.) The Roman declaration had
nothing to do with Antiochos' crossing: no connection is made between the two in
Livy, and the chronology tells decisively against. Two quite separate questions are,
accordingly, raised. One: why Antiochos crossed into Greece when and as he did;
two: why Rome declared war against him.
The answer to the question about Rome is, in general, quite clear. Even before the
end of the war against Philip the Romans had had Antiochos in their sights. The
dealings between the two have been characterized as a kind of `cold war' (Badian
1959). It was more a matter of the Romans making a series of demands, with
Antiochos tr ying to find ways of responding to them: this was not unlike the situation
with Philip a few years before, when the Romans ordered him to make war on no
Greeks, and the outcome could scarcely have been dif ferent. In detail, a question does
remain. In the spring of 192 the Romans had found `no suf ficiently ripe reason for
war' against Antiochos. When did they find one, and what was it? The answer to this
may be found in the of fer, made by Antiochos after the war had begun, to withdraw
from the cities of Lampsakos, Smyr na, and Alexandria Troas, `from which the war
took its beginnings' (Polyb. 21.13). Exactly what lies behind this is beyond recover y,
but the implication is clear. And we know that the Senate had under taken to protect
Lampsakos at the time of the Lampsakene embassy of 197/6 (see above). Nothing
similar is known for sure about the other two cities, but it is known that the inhabit
ants of Smyr na in 195 dedicated a sanctuar y to the deified City of Rome (Tac.Ann.
4.56), perhaps in search of goodwill and benefit, perhaps as a gesture of thanks for
something. Most striking of all might be the form of the Roman declaration of war
against Antiochos (Livy 36.1). It contains no reference to wrongs done by Antiochos,
whether to the Romans or to their allies, and in this respect it is unique amongst
sur viving Roman declarations of war. The people were asked simply whether they
wished to declare war against Antiochos and those who followed him. This was a war
for conquest outright, perhaps indeed the only one of its kind during this period.
Antiochos' conduct late in 192 may be seen in general as a response to the
deter mined pressure of Rome in the preceding years, expressed in a series of orders.
In par ticular there were dealings (of which we have not the details) to do with
Lampsakos, Smyrna and Alexandria Troas, and a Roman force had entered mainland
Greece in the summer. When the Aitolians invited Antiochos to Demetrias, the point
had come where he had to respond. That he had not been planning this is indicated
by the evident insuf fiency of the force with which he crossed. This must indicate also
that he hoped to find widespread antipathy towards Rome in Greece and cor respond
ingly widespread suppor t for himself. One of the most interesting things in the whole
af fair is that it seems at least par t of his hope was by no means unfounded. Polybios
repor ts that when the Achaians declared war on Antiochos four months before the
Roman crossing into Greece in early spring 191 ± around the time of Antiochos'
crossing, that is ± nearly all the other Greeks were alienated from the Romans (39.6).
Even allowing for some exaggeration on Polybios' par t (but there is no evidence to
64 Peter Derow



suggest such), this is a strong statement. Apparently the enthusiasm so loudly voiced
at the Isthmian Games in 196 had over the next four years largely evaporated in
Greece. It is dif ficult, if not impossible, to trace this development in detail, but one
must conclude in general that the freedom the Greeks believed they were getting was
dif ferent from the freedom the Romans believed they were bestowing. That disaf fec
tion from Rome did not translate into suppor t for Antiochos and his Aitolian allies is
less of a surprise. In the case of Epeiros the reason is known. They would be the first
to receive the Roman onslaught, and, as such they would not join unless substantial
militar y protection were provided for them, and Antiochos, who had crossed with a
small force, was in no position to do this (Polyb. 20.3). In some other places, for
example in Boiotia and Thessaly (see above), one may imagine that those whom the
Romans had helped into power were glad of their situation and accordingly desirous
of maintaining the authority of their benefactors.
The war itself was not a long af fair. The Romans were quick off the mark. Their
fleet was in the Aegean in time to intercept Antiochos' transports early in 191.
Antiochos himself was defeated in battle at Thermopylai by the army that arrived,
also early in the year, under M'. Acilius Glabrio, consul of 191. He retreated to Asia
Minor whither he was followed and then defeated again at Magnesia-by-Sipylos by
the Romans under L. Cornelius Scipio (Africanus' brother, consul of 190, who took
the cognomen Asiaticus) in Januar y 189. The Aitolians were reduced in 189 by
M. Fulvius Nobilior, consul. They were obliged by treaty to swear to uphold the
majesty and imperium of the Roman people and to pay an indemnity of 500 talents,
suf ficient to bankrupt them. Antiochos was obliged to cede all his territor y to the
west of the Tauros mountains and to pay an indemnity of 15,000 talents, 3000 at
once with the rest to be paid in annual instalments: this was the most profitable war
the Romans had ever fought, and the indemnity from Antiochos may reasonably be
judged to have altered forever the nature of Rome's public economy. By the settle
ment known as the Peace of Apameia the Romans organized the Greek East as they
saw fit. It had not been a war fought alongside allies, but those who had suppor ted
Rome were rewarded, most notably Eumenes of Pergamon and the Rhodians in Asia
Minor. But all the rewards were precarious, wholly dependent upon continuing
suppor t of Rome's dominion.
In the space of twelve years (200±188) the Romans had reduced the two greatest
sur vivors of Alexander the Great's empire, the Macedonian and Seleukid kingdoms.
In doing so they established in their place, throughout the Greek world, the domin
ion of Rome. For Polybios this was not established until 167 and the end of the
Macedonian monarchy. He had his own reasons for choosing this date (cf. Walbank
1994), and there is a formal sense in which the dominion of Rome could not replace
that of Macedon whilst the kingdom of Macedon still existed. But in practical terms,
as the sequel shows, the point had ef fectively been reached where, as Polybios put it
(3.4), there was nothing left but `to give heed to the Romans and obey them in their
orders'. Roman supremacy is revealingly recognized by Eumenes. In granting a
request made to him by the inhabitants of Tyriaion in rural southeastern Phr ygia
he wrote, not long after 188: `any (favour) bestowed on you by me at this moment
would be durable, since I have full authority by vir tue of having received it from the
Romans who gained power both by war and by treaty' (Jonnes and Ricl 1997). That
Rome's authority was to be uniquely supreme was also the Roman view.
From the Illyrian Wars to the Fall of Macedon 65



4 The Beginning of Roman Rule
The post-Apameia era began as it was to continue for some time, with numerous
embassies from the Greek world to Rome, as individuals and groups sought Roman
suppor t for their own purposes. Rome was, and was perceived as, the sole arbiter of
affairs. They were the `cops of the world' (Ochs 1966). Many were there in the spring
of 187. More than ever before were there in the spring of 183, as the situation
became ever clearer. Amongst the most enthusiastic were Eumenes, who came to
denounce Philip for taking possession of some Thracian cities, and a group of
Spar tans, who came to protest about Achaian treatment of Spar ta (which had been
brought into the Achaian League in 192). In both cases the Senate took cognizance
of the complaints. In the case of Macedon, this was the beginning of a period of
pressure by Rome upon Philip which resulted, according to Polybios, in the decision
of that king to formulate plans of militar y resistance to Rome. This was, perhaps, not
surprising. Rome's war against Philip had been ended when conflict with Antiochos
was already envisaged and with that conflict in mind; as it drew nearer, concessions
had been made to Philip to keep him on side. But the Romans were ever slow to
forgive. At the same time, Eumenes had established himself as the most reliable king
in the east. If the Roman decision to lend suppor t in the case of the discontented
group at Spar ta is more surprising, it is also the more revealing. The Achaians had
recently been the most reliable state in Greece, but in accepting the appeal from some
Spar tans, the Senate ef fectively condoned a breach in the constitution of the League:
dealings with foreign states were the province of the League, and not of individual
cities within it, let alone of groups of individuals within the cities. The ef fect, inevit
ably, was to foster dissension, and the possibility of fragmentation, within the Pelo
ponnese and within the League. Whether the Romans intended to do this is another
question. Probably not. The power of Rome to decide things had been won by war
and by treaty, as Eumenes put it. Roman policy consisted in the exercise of that
power; there was little need to manipulate people. By seeking the suppor t or approval
of Rome, people manipulated and weakened themselves and thereby af firmed that
power. The Roman response to the Spar tans' de Â marche is perhaps the sor t of thing
Polybios had in mind when he said, writing of a later time and context but with
reference to the period before 168, that `measures of this kind are ver y frequent
among the Romans, by which they avail themselves with profound policy of the
mistakes of others to augment and strengthen their own empire, under the guise of
granting favours and benefiting those who commit the errors' (31.10.7, trans.
Shuckburgh; cf. Derow 1979: 14 n. 39). This more (or less) cynical view also has
its place in the interpretation of the years after Apameia.
There were still in Achaia in the 180s those who believed (or hoped) that it was still
possible to deal with the Romans on a basis of isologia, on the basis, that is, that
genuine dialogue was possible, that the laws and institutions of the Achaians could
carr y weight against the force of Roman orders, that expressions of Roman power
could be attenuated by reasoned argument. They were deceived in their belief (or
hope). Whilst the question of Sparta was still unsettled, Messene revolted from the
Achaian League. The Achaians sought Roman suppor t. Rome's temporizing response
`made it entirely clear to ever yone that so far from shirking and not caring about the
less impor tant items of foreign affairs, they were displeased if all matters were not
66 Peter Derow



referred to them and if ever ything was not done in accordance with their decision'
(Polyb. 23.17). In the end, the Achaians dealt successfully with both Spar ta and
Messene. An embassy was sent to Rome to report this. One of the Achaian envoys,
Kallikrates of Leontion, told the Senate that in all the democratic states of Greece
there were two groups, one which advocated adherence to Roman orders at the
expense of local institutions and one which did not. The latter were more popular
with the population at large; if the Romans wanted their orders obeyed, they must
suppor t those who promised obedience. Polybios reckoned that it was `now for the
first time that the Senate adopted the aim of weakening those members of the several
states who worked for the best, and of strengthening those who, rightly or wrongly,
appealed to its authority' (24.10). But this had been the Roman way for some time:
Kallikrates was not responsible for a change in Roman policy, although he was
responsible for denouncing Polybios as insuf ficiently pro-Roman after the war against
Perseus and thereby securing the latter's depor tation to Rome. Kallikrates himself,
armed with Rome's approbation, returned to be elected to the chief magistracy of the
Achaian League.
It might have gone on that way for some time, with the combination of Roman
orders and Rome's adherents gradually eroding Greek independence, but the situ
ation was significantly altered in 179 with the death of Philip V and the accession of
his son Perseus. Philip's other son, Demetrios, had fallen prey to the blandishments of
Romans who wished to see him succeed to the Macedonian throne in preference to
Perseus and victim at home to what was ef fectively a charge of treason; his father was
obliged to order his execution. Perseus began his reign by renewing Macedon's
alliance with Rome and by seeking favour in Greece at large. In the latter, which
amounted to a resuscitation of the good name and repute of Macedon, he was
remarkably successful. Alliances and connections were formed or renewed, with
Prusias, with Seleukos, with Delphi and with Rhodes. Early in his reign, his half
sister married Prusias II, and he himself married Laodike, daughter of Seleukos IV; at
Delphi, `liberated' from Aitolian control by the Romans in 191 and since then the
preser ve of pro-Romans, he regained two Macedonian votes in the Delphic Amphik
tyony; in return for a gift of timber, the Rhodians escor ted Perseus' Seleukid bride to
Macedon. Rome noticed. In 178 an appeal from the L ykians against Rhodes met with
favour at Rome. By the settlement of 188 the L ykians had been given over to the
Rhodians; now the Romans, apprised of the Rhodian escor t and rapprochement with
Perseus, decided that that had not been the case. Perseus himself did nothing hostile
towards Rome. He did not need to: his growing influence and popularity amongst
Greeks (he ver y nearly succeeded in normalizing relations with the Achaians, but
Kallikrates persuaded them that that would be against the wishes of Rome and
thereby carried the day) meant that he was an alternative focus for Greek political
attention. The nature of Rome's dominion was such as not to allow any alternative
focuses.
In Greece and areas adjacent the growth of Perseus' popularity and influence was
matched by diminution in that of Eumenes, who had based his authority upon
Roman supremacy. In 172 Eumenes went to Rome and denounced Perseus (whilst
noting his success at winning suppor t amongst the Greeks at the expense of Rome) at
length. For the Romans that was enough, par ticularly in a time of unrest, which the
170s in Greece cer tainly were (problems of debt and the threat of civil war arising
From the Illyrian Wars to the Fall of Macedon 67



therefrom were especially rife in Aitolia, Thessaly and the nor th). Preparations for the
war began, and an embassy went to Greece, led by Q. Marcius Philippus. Philippus
tricked Perseus into accepting the possibility that peace with Rome was still possible
(he prided himself upon this tricker y on his return to Rome; most approved) and did
what he could to disarm suppor t for Perseus (notably in Boiotia, where he secured the
dissolution of the Boiotian League). The possibility of peace was illusor y. The consul
entrusted with the war against Perseus reached Greece in 171 even earlier in the year
than had been managed in 191. The Roman accusations against Perseus were
inscribed at Delphi, presumably at the same time (SIG
3 643; trans. Sherk 19;
BD 44). These latter were ef fectively a repetition of the list of allegations that
Eumenes had brought to Rome in 172. Amongst them was the accusation that
Perseus was fomenting social revolutions (neoterismoi) in the states of Greece.
Rome was defending an order of things. The freedom of the Greeks was no longer
an issue, even in the propaganda. Nor were alliances. This was a Roman war, and the
Romans chose to fight it without militar y allies: of fers of assistance were declined.
Early in the war Perseus defeated the Romans in a cavalr y engagement. Though of
no special militar y moment, it evoked a groundswell of suppor t across Greece for the
king (Polyb. 27.9±10: Polybios does his best to persuade that this did not betoken
real af fection for Perseus, or hostility to Rome, on the par t of the rank and file; one
may wonder if he intended his defence of the Greeks as much for a contemporar y
audience as for a more distant posterity). The early years of the war were marked more
by the indiscipline and rapacity of the Romans, troops and generals alike, than by
militar y success. Order was restored in 168 when L. Aemilius Paullus (consul in 182
and now again) took command, and the inevitable triumph of Italian manpower came
at the battle of Pydna in June 168. The Illyrian King Genthios, who had allied himself
to Perseus, was defeated in the same year after a ver y shor t campaign.
The militar y challenge to Rome's control was at an end. Unencumbered by
obligations, the Romans proceeded to the settlement of Greece. Something is
known of the arrangement of af fairs in Achaia, Aitolia and Epeiros:
During the year before the battle the Achaeans and Aetolians had been treated with
circumspection and a measure of indulgence. During the year following it Roman
ambassadors visited the Achaeans again. This time they informed them that one thou
sand individuals (among them Polybius), whose loyalty had become suspect, were to be
deported to Italy. This list was drawn up by Callicrates and those of his party. This was
harsh, but gentle when compared to the handling of Aetolia, where 550 leading men
were murdered while Roman soldiers surrounded the council-chamber and others driven
into exile (Livy 45.28.7). A fate even more special was reser ved for Epirus, par ticularly
for the Molossians, who had taken the side of Perseus during the war and from among
whom had originated the plot to kidnap the consul Hostilius in 170. After the laxity of
the earlier years of the war the Roman army had had discipline imposed upon it. The
patience of the soldiers was rewarded when Aemilius Paullus led them home in 167. In
accordance with a decree of the Senate seventy towns of Epirus (mostly Molossian) were
given to them to plunder. One hundred and fifty thousand people were said to have been
sold into slaver y as a result of Paullus' march to the sea (Polyb. 30.15). . . . In these and
the other states of mainland Greece the ascendancy of the pro-Romans was assured by
deportations, bloodbaths and fear. For the moment, however, the states remained intact.
(Derow 1989: 317)

The warring kingdoms were dismembered. Macedon was divided into four
rigorously separate states and Illyria into three. In both cases these states were to
pay to Rome as tribute half what had been paid as taxes to their kings. This was,
on the one hand, the available alternative to an indemnity; it was also an enduring
sign of subject status. So was Roman dominion in Greece insisted upon and
re-established.
Dif ferently striking, and cer tainly por tentous, was the Roman treatment of Rhodes
and Eumenes. Rhodes had not suppor ted Perseus in the war, or opposed Rome, but
it was home to a significant pro-Macedonian faction. In 169 Q. Marcius Philippus
tricked the Rhodians into thinking that Rome would welcome an attempt to mediate
an end to the Macedonian war. The mediation came in June 168 and was, of course,
far from welcome. Delos was declared a free por t, a ver y damaging blow indeed to the
Rhodian economy which was so dependent upon harbour taxes. It might have been
worse: there were those at Rome who wanted war against Rhodes. This was success
fully opposed by, amongst others, Cato the Elder, who had a ver y clear notion of why
the Rhodians had acted as they did and of what it was all about (his words preser ved
by Aulus Gellius 6.4.16):
And I really think that the Rhodians did not wish us to end the war as we did, with a
victor y over king Perseus. But it was not the Rhodians alone who had that feeling, but
I believe that many peoples and many nations agreed with them. And I am inclined
to think that some of them did not wish us success, not in order that we might be
disgraced, but because they feared that if there were no one of whom we stood in dread,
we should do whatsoever we chose. I think, then, that it was with an eye to their own
freedom that they held that opinion, in order not to be under our sole dominion and
enslaved to us.
Eumenes, who had done more than anyone to help Rome into the war against
Perseus, was rejected outright by the Romans as soon as it was over. When he arrived
in Italy on his way to Rome to of fer his congratulations, he was ordered to depart the
countr y for thwith. It was said that he had sought to make common cause with
Perseus against Rome. This seems scarcely credible. But, if it was not that, what
was his crime? Perhaps there did not have to be one. With Macedon gone, Eumenes'
Pergamon was the most influential (and popular) Greek player left on the Greek
stage: exactly what Eumenes had wanted, exactly what the Romans did not.
Returning to Greece after his dismissal from Italy, Eumenes was met by a delegation
from the Ionian League, who presented him with a ver y honorific decree indeed
which praised him as `common benefactor of the Greeks' and bestowed great and
public honours upon him (known from Eumenes' letter accepting the honours,OGIS
763; trans. BD 47): this was surely seen as unwelcome competition, whether or not it
was intended as such (on the idea of Romans as common benefactors, Erskine 1994).
Roman policy towards Pergamon in the years following continued in the same vein
and did much to humble and destabilize that kingdom. Polybios remarks that `the
harsher the conduct of the Romans to Eumenes the more attached to him did the
Greeks become' (31.6.6). A sure sign of things to come. Pergamon was bullied into
trepid docility (see RC 61; BD 50; Sherk 29), but others would not be, not in Greece
in 146, not in Asia in 88.

FURTHER READING
The first por t of call for an extended narrative of this period is Cambridge Ancient
Histor y VIII (2nd edition, 1989; with references and extensive bibliography). The
chapters by Holleaux in the first edition of volumes VII (1928) and VIII (1930)
remain unsurpassed for elegance (the original French versions, even more elegant,
may be found in Holleaux 1952 and 1957), even if the necessity to disagree fre
quently imposes itself. As indeed it does with Holleaux 1921, with which modern
study of Roman expansion in the Greek world may be reckoned to have begun and
which should still constitute essential reading. Two monumental monographs on the
subject appeared in the 1980s, Gruen 1984 and Ferrar y 1988. Both are essential
reading (and contain full bibliographies). The former is deser vedly the most influen
tial book on the subject to have appeared since Holleaux 1921 and the one with
which there is perhaps most disagreement in the preceding pages; the world around
the historian changes. Prior to those, and reacted to by those but still rightly influen
tial, are Badian 1958a and W. Harris 1979, who did so much to define basic questions
still under discussion: as it has been put, with some risk of oversimplification,
`Badian's Romans like clients / they're not ver y big on alliance / for Harris they're
mean / and psychotically keen / on glor y, on war, and on triumphs'. But at the base
of it all lie above all the incomparable Polybios of Megalopolis, Livy of Patavium, and
the evidence of inscriptions; the full incorporation of the last into the stor y has still
some way to go. Most of the lines of narrative and interpretation, not separable
things, in the preceding pages have been put for ward or adumbrated in Derow 1970,
1973a, 1979, 1984, 1989, 1990, 1991. In addition to the items cited in these pages,
a few fur ther suggestions for reading can be made: Briscoe 1973, 1981, Freeman
1893, de Ste Croix 1981, Walbank 1944 and Dao 2002, the last a ver y recent and
resonant reminder of the interest of this period of histor y, and of the impor tance of
studying it, for the world of today. There are a number of less recent works in both
categories; they exemplify precision and elegance of thought and expression and
illustrate the impor tance of passion for the writing of histor y. All the more modern
books referred to contain hugely useful bibliographies amongst much else.

CHAPTER FIVE
Subjection and Resistance:
to the Death of Mithradates
Brian McGing
1 Introduction
On 29 August 168 B C Isias wrote a letter to her husband Hephaistion urging him to
leave the temple of Sarapis in the old Egyptian capital of Memphis, where he was
delaying, and come home:
When I received your letter. . . , in which you announce that you are in seclusion in
the Sarapeion at Memphis, for the news that you are well, I straightway thanked the
gods. But about your not coming home, when all the others who had been secluded
there have come, I am ill-pleased: having steered myself and your child through such
bad times and been driven to ever y extremity owing to the price of corn I thought that
now at least, with you at home, I should enjoy some respite . . . (UPZ I 59 Sel.Pap.
I 97)
Hephaistion was ver y probably a soldier in the army of the Ptolemies who had been
involved in the recent war against Antiochos IV of Syria (169±8B C ), and had stopped
of f in Memphis on his way home. We cannot be sure exactly what he was doing in the
Sarapeion: it would be nice to think he was celebrating his release from the army, but
it is more likely he was tr ying to improve his finances (D. J. Thompson 1988: 230±1).
It is not often that we get a reflection of great events in the lives of ordinar y people,
but one of the most famous displays of Roman arrogance and power lay behind
Hephaistion's decommissioning from the army. Just a few weeks before Isias sent her
letter, the Roman legate C. Popillius Laenas had confronted Antiochos at Eleusis, a
suburb of Alexandria, and demanded that he cease his assault on Egypt (which was on
the verge of final success) and withdraw to Syria. When Antiochos asked for time to
consult his advisors, Popillius drew a circle around him in the sand and said he must
answer before leaving the circle (Polyb. 29.27). Antiochos wisely backed down, and
in due course Hephaistion found himself free to go home.
No doubt Isias knew little or nothing of Popillius and the dramatic events taking
place during the dif ficult summer when her husband was of f at the war. The Greek
politician and historian, Polybios, on the other hand, was right at the centre of what



was happening in those exciting times and provides our most impor tant historical
source. He understood it was Rome's victor y over Perseus, king of Macedon, at the
battle of Pydna, on 22 June 168, that forced Antiochos to yield to Popillius'
`diplomacy'. In fact victor y in this Third Macedonian War (172±168) marked, for
Polybios, a watershed. Roman rule was now established in the Mediterranean, not
in the sense of a territorial empire, but to the extent that for all the peoples of the
region the parameters of what was politically possible were now seriously circum
scribed: obey Rome's orders or face destruction in war (Derow 1979). This may
have been clear to Polybios in retrospect, but not ever yone necessarily accepted it at
the time. In the centur y covered by this chapter, from the defeat of Perseus to the
death of Mithradates Eupator in 63 B C , Hellenistic armies fought five major wars
against Rome in the Greek east: the Macedonian pretender Andriskos, the Achaian
League, the Attalid pretender Aristonikos and the famous king of Pontos, Mithra
dates VI Eupator, all asser ted their independence in war, but without success.
Ironically each bid for freedom drew Rome a little further into the Greek world:
in 168 Rome held no territor y whatever in the eastern Mediterranean; in 63 she
had a string of provinces and protectorates in the region. If Pydna marked the end
of one process ± the establishment of Roman dominance ± the struggle against
Mithradates marked another ± the commitment of Rome to empire (Kallet-Marx
1995: 341).
The big political stor y of the period for the Greek world, then, was undoubtedly its
relationship with the new Mediterranean superpower; but it was not the only stor y.
Even in geopolitical terms, there was one other major player in the region ± Par thia ±
and for the Seleukids at least, it was their main problem: they succumbed not so much
to Roman inter ference, irritating and debilitating as that was, but to the irresistible
force of Par thian expansion. And in the matter of organizing their own internal af fairs
and their own relationships with each other, the monarchies and cities of the Greek
east went about their business in the accustomed fashion. Arbitrations, alliances,
treaties, marriages, benefactions, were the ver y stuf f of Hellenistic inter-state rela
tionships; and they continued as before. Although Rome had now ef fectively forced
herself into membership of the club of Hellenistic states, this did not fundamentally
affect the continuation of normal Hellenistic practices: the Greeks simply accepted
the Senate, indeed invited it, as one of the par ticipants in the diplomatic processes
of the Greek east (Gruen 1984: Vol. I). And the new member did not have to be
involved in ever ything: even wars, if they were suf ficiently distant or unimportant,
could sometimes be conducted without reference to Rome. In spite of these con
tinuities, however, there was, not surprisingly, a new unease among the Greeks.
The Romans might be content to play the power game largely by Greek rules, but
militar y superiority meant that they could change the rules whenever they liked.
Realization of this threat caused some individual Greek politicians to spend a great
deal of time looking over their shoulder, ner vously gauging likely Roman reaction
to events. And with good reason. If at times Roman policy in the Greek east
seemed distinctly lackadaisical and unconcerned, it is also the case that ver y little
happened without at least attracting an investigative commission from the Senate.
An examination of the 160s and 150s will bring out some of the main trends of
the period.

2 The Aftermath of Pydna
The Roman settlement of af fairs after their victor y at the battle of Pydna must have
shaken the Greeks. Naturally, those who opposed Rome suffered the worst. Most
dramatic was the suppression of the Macedonian monarchy: the line of kings stretch
ing back into archaic times was now brought to an end and the kingdom split into
four independent republics, tributar y to Rome, but `free' (Livy 45.29±30; Gruen
1984: 423±9). Macedon's ally, Illyria, shared the same fate. In Epeiros, which had
sided with Perseus, 150,000 people were said to have been sold into slaver y (Polyb.
30.15). Perhaps even more shocking was the treatment of those states, including
friends and allies, who took no par t in the fighting, but about whose loyalty Rome
was not satisfied. On the mainland leading Aitolians were murdered in their council
chamber, and a thousand Achaians were depor ted to Italy (Derow, this volume).
Elsewhere Rhodes, a staunch ally and friend of Rome, suffered badly for its ill
timed attempt at mediation (Gruen 1984: 569±72; Habicht 1989: 336±8; Ager
1996: no. 121). Karia and L ykia, granted to them twenty years earlier as a reward
for their help in the war against Antiochos III, were now taken away; so too were the
valuable towns of Kaunos and Stratonikeia ± they provided an annual income of 120
talents ± although their acquisition by Rhodes was nothing to do with Rome; and,
worst of all, Delos was made a free por t, attracting business that reduced Rhodes'
own harbour income from one million drachmas to 150,000 (Polyb. 30.31). Des
perate to regain the favour of Rome the Rhodians tenaciously sought a treaty, finally
succeeding in 164/3. It is dif ficult to imagine that such severe punishment can have
resulted solely from an offer of mediation by loyal allies. Both Prusias II of Bithynia
and Ptolemy VI of Egypt also of fered to arbitrate, without annoying Rome in the
least, although Prusias subsequently felt it advisable to behave with a degree of
ser vility that disgusted Polybios (30.18). A growing sense of invincibility might
have seen the Senate happy to cut smug allies down to size, but there is also room
for suspicion that Rhodes was not quite so unambiguously loyal as they later made
out.
The Senate also harboured grave suspicions about the loyalty during the war of
another good friend of theirs, Eumenes II of Pergamon (Polyb. 29.5; 30.1). In spite
of the militar y assistance he af forded Rome, he was now humiliated and his authority
in Asia Minor undermined (Gruen 1984: 573±8): his Galatian subjects had rebelled
in 168, and, possibly, received encouragement from Rome; when Eumenes travelled
to Rome to ask the Senate for help, he was refused a hearing and turned back at
Brundisium; and when he finally defeated the Galatians the Senate declared them free.
In 164 the Roman commissioner C. Sulpicius invited accusations against Eumenes
and spent ten days in Sardis listening to them (Polyb. 31.6). But, as Polybios
obser ved, the more Rome mistreated Eumenes, the better the Greeks liked him.
Virtually the only Greek state to be rewarded by Rome after the war was Athens
(Habicht 1997: 213±19). At the beginning of the second centur y in their need for
protection against Macedon the Athenians had turned to Rome, and thereafter wisely
pursued a solidly pro-Roman policy. In 167 the Senate awarded them Delos, Lemnos
and the land of Haliar tos (Polyb. 30.20). Polybios was highly critical of the Athenian
acquisition of Haliar tos ± they should have striven harder to protect its freedom,
To the Death of Mithradates 73



rather than grab it for themselves ± and was obviously pleased to obser ve that in
getting Delos and Lemnos they `were taking the wolf by the ears' (a reference to later
disputes). Of course they were no longer a major militar y power. Perhaps this
weakness, combined with a reputation as a great intellectual centre, enabled them
to pursue their own, and benefit from other states', diplomatic policies that did not
have to reflect Roman prejudices (Habicht 1997: 220±7). While Rome had defeated
Antiochos III in 190 and continued to inter fere troublesomely in Seleukid af fairs
thereafter, this did not prevent Athens enjoying excellent relations with Seleukos IV,
and par ticularly with Antiochos IV, whose lavish sponsorship of work to complete the
huge Peisistratid temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens had still not seen it finished
when he died in 164. If the Senate chose to humiliate Pergamon after the defeat of
Perseus, Athens continued to maintain, and reap the benefits of, its close friendship
with the Attalid kingdom (the most spectacular visual evidence of this friendship was
provided by the stoas of Eumenes II and of his brother Attalos II). The Ptolemies had
acted as Athens' main protector in the third centur y, and although Rome took over
this role in the second centur y, the Athenians remained the closest of friends with the
Ptolemies and their cour tiers (Habicht 1992: 68±90).
If Ptolemies and Seleukids could continue to pursue independent diplomatic
policies, they could also conduct inter nal wars in their own kingdoms. In the early
160s Ptolemy VI had to put down a dangerous native revolt in the nor th of Egypt led
by Dionysios Petosarapis and another one in the Thebaid (Diod. 31.15a; 17b;
McGing 1997: 289±95). Antiochos IV, when faced with what seemed to be a Jewish
insur rection during his invasion of Egypt, reacted with a ferocious, but unwise,
persecution of the Jews ± the famous `abomination of desolation' (Daniel 11:31). If
the Jews had not actually been in revolt when Antiochos thought they were, they
cer tainly took up ar ms when he attempted to destroy their religion (Gr uen, this
volume). Antiochos quickly backed of f when he realized his mistake, but he had set in
motion the Maccabaean revolt, which was to plague the Seleukid gover nment in the
coming generations. Antiochos also had to face revolt in his eastern ter ritories.
Having been rebuf fed in his attempt to conquer Egypt, he tur ned his attention to
the problem. In 166 he held a magnificent parade at Daphne in the outskir ts of
Antioch (Polyb. 30.25±6; Diod. 31.16.2). Although not entirely militar y in charac
ter, it contained an impressive display of militar y might. Polybios thought the
intention was to outdo Aemilius Paullus, who the year before had celebrated his
victor y at Pydna in similar fashion. No doubt Antiochos' intentions were various.
Although he had yielded to Rome, he had also won a great victor y over the Egyp
tians. A demonstration of power, then, to his own people and to Rome, a celebration
of victor y and perhaps an announcement of his new campaign in the east, launched
the following year. We know ver y little of what happened on this campaign or even of
what Antiochos intended, as the sources are poor and he died in 164, too soon to
identify his precise objectives, but Seleukid control in the east was cr umbling and
Antiochos was clearly tr ying to shore it up (Mùrkholm 1966: 166±80; Habicht
1989: 350±3). While this was all far too distant to elicit Roman inter vention, it is
interesting to obser ve that the Senate still kept a watchful and wor ried eye on
Antiochos. Gaius Sulpicius and Manius Sergius were despatched to check that he
was not conniving with Pergamon to attack Rome (Polyb. 31.1.6±8). And the parade
at Daphne had not gone unnoticed: Tiberius Gracchus had led a delegation to
74 Brian McGing



investigate, but succumbed to Antiochos' charm and found nothing to cause concer n
(Polyb. 30.27).
That the Senate was concerned, and was ready to meddle in Seleukid af fairs, is
evident from their treatment of the royal succession. The seeds of Seleukid dynastic
weakness had been sown in the aftermath of Rome's victor y over Antiochos III in
189. Antiochos' younger son, the future Antiochos IV, had been held as a hostage in
Rome, while his elder brother, Seleukos IV, became king in 187. On Seleukos'
assassination in 175, Antiochos IV won the throne against the obvious legal claims
of Seleukos' eldest son, Demetrios, who then replaced Antiochos IV as hostage in
Rome. Thus was established a most damaging split in the Seleukid royal house, with
two branches of the family contending for the throne (Sher win-White and K È u hr t
1993: 221). It was a split which, with only a minimum of ef for t, Rome was able and
pleased to exploit. When Antiochos IV died Demetrios made a strong plea that he be
allowed to take up the throne, but the Senate backed Antiochos V, the young son of
Antiochos IV, because, in the opinion of Polybios (31.2.7, trans. Paton), `they were
suspicious of a king in the prime of life like Demetrios and thought that the youth and
incapacity of the boy who had succeeded to the throne would ser ve their purpose
better'. With an inef fective boy-king on the throne the Senate sent of f a commission
with instr uctions `in the first place to burn the decked warships, next to hamstring the
elephants and by ever y means to cripple the royal power'. At about the same time
another mode of inter ference in Seleukid af fairs presented itself to the Senate ±
suppor t of the rebellious Jews. In 164 there was initial diplomatic contact (II
Macc
.
11.34±8), and in 161 Judas Maccabaeus apparently succeeded in winning a treaty of
alliance with Rome and a letter from the Senate threatening Demetrios, who in 162
had finally managed to escape from Rome and win the Seleukid throne (I
Macc
. 8;
Jos.
AJ
12.414±19; Gr uen 1984: 42±6). As there was no Roman response at all to the
subsequent defeat and death of Judas at Seleukid hands, it seems unlikely that the
Senate intended anything ver y practical with the treaty; but it was perhaps no harm to
make hostile diplomatic noises against Demetrios and let him know that they might
choose to of fer real assistance to the Jews if it suited them. Attempts to weaken the
Ptolemaic dynasty also, by playing of f Ptolemy VI Philometor against his younger
brother Ptolemy VIII Physkon, are identified by Polybios in the year 163/2 (Polyb.
31.10; Gr uen 1984: 692±702). This sor t of cynical manipulation he now regarded as
a feature of Roman policy:
Decisions of this kind are now ver y frequent with the Romans; they rely on the mistakes
of others to increase and secure their own empire in a statesmanlike way, by doing favours
and appearing to confer benefactions on the of fenders. That is why, seeing the greatness
of the Egyptian kingdom and fearing that should it ever find a leader he might become
excessively arrogant, they appointed as ambassadors Titus Torquatus and Gnaeus Mer ula
to establish Ptolemy in Cypr us and carr y out at once the king's design and their own. (cf.
Derow, this volume, section 4)
Polybios' viewpoint is Rome's: he does not tell us whether the Ptolemies or Seleukids
felt ner vous about how their actions might be interpreted at Rome. There is reason to
think, however, that at least some of the Greek states were extremely ner vous. Even in
the relatively harmless area of dynastic marriage, in 161/0 Ariarathes V, the new king
To the Death of Mithradates
75



of Cappadocia, found his prof fered bride, Laodike, too hot to handle: she was the
sister of the Seleukid king Demetrios, currently enjoying the extreme disfavour of the
Senate, and widow of Rome's defeated enemy, Perseus of Macedon. Diodoros
(31.28) states that in turning her down he yielded to Roman pressure, or at least
acted in deference to Rome. The case is undoubtedly an exception ± the royal houses
of the Greek east usually pursued a vigorous and fully independent marriage policy
(see the list in Seiber t 1967: 129±34) ± but it shows just how beholden to Rome a
Hellenistic king might feel. The most famous piece of evidence in this connection is
the letter of about 156 from Attalos II of Pergamon to Attis, priest of Kybele,
concerning joint action they were planning against the Galatians (
RC
61, Austin
208). The matter was discussed among Attalos' advisers and although they initially
thought other wise, gradually the view prevailed that it would be extremely dangerous
to proceed without consulting the Romans. If they acted unilaterally and were
successful, `the result would be jealousy, displeasure and hostile suspicion'. Failure
would be disastrous, `for they would not stir a finger, but would look on with
satisfaction, as we had under taken such a great project without consulting them'.
So Attalos decided to keep the Romans closely informed. This is exactly the same
policy as enunciated by the pro-Roman Achaian politician, Kallikrates, in 154/3: the
Achaians should not go to war with anyone or send help to anyone without taking the
advice of Rome (Polyb. 33.16.7±8). Similarly Ophelas, the
epimeletes
(governor) of
the island of Delos in the year 147/6, is praised in an honorific inscription for his
unquestioning acceptance of Rome's will (TrÂ eheux and Charneaux 1998: 241±2):
not only did he maintain the friendship and goodwill of the Romans, he even
increased it, by following closely their written instr uctions, by welcoming Roman
ambassadors to the island and by obser ving the decisions of the Senate communi
cated by the ambassadors. These were states and politicians in relatively close contact
with Rome, but even some fur ther afield felt it necessar y to be a `friend' of Rome. An
inscription dating from 155 BC
(or 179) records a treaty between king Pharnakes I of
Pontos and the Crimean city of Chersonesos, in which both par ties under take to
`maintain their friendship with the Romans and do nothing contrar y to them'
(
IOSPE
I
2
402, trans. Sherk 30). Pharnakes had fought a war against his neighbours
in Asia Minor during the 180s, so his activities were not without interest to the
Senate, but that Rome should be a central element in a treaty between two such
distant states is testament to her growing influence, and to the recognition of this
among the Greeks.
No doubt many states when faced with tricky political decisions acted in the same
ner vous fashion. But there are also signs of greater boldness. Demetrios, who, as we
saw, had been kept hostage in Rome while the Seleukid throne that was rightfully his
went to Antiochos V, eventually lost patience with the Senate's repeated refusal to let
him go. In 162 he escaped from Rome, seized the throne and executed Antiochos
(Polyb. 31.11±15; I
Macc
. 7.1±4: App.
Syr
. 47). This was a beginning to his reign
bound to displease Rome. The Senate almost immediately bestowed its favour on a
pretender, Timarchos, satrap of Media (Diod. 31.27a), made a treaty with the Jewish
rebels and put pressure on Ariarathes V of Cappadocia not to marr y Demetrios' sister.
Demetrios did tr y to mend diplomatic fences with the Senate, but he never really
succeeded: in 150 he was defeated and killed by a pretender to the throne, named
Alexander Balas, who was backed primarily by a coalition of Pergamon, Cappadocia
76

and Egypt, but who had also received the verbal suppor t of the Senate (Gruen 1984:
585±6; 666±8). Rome's commitment to Demetrios' enemies was purely verbal and
senatorial inter vention in his af fairs may not have amounted to a sustained campaign
to topple him, but the Fathers were consistently ill-disposed to him throughout his
reign. Perhaps accepting this as a fact of life from the beginning, he set about looking
after his own interests regardless of Rome (Habicht 1989: 356±62). He defeated and
killed Timarchos and Judas Maccabaeus, and then star ted meddling in Cappadocian
af fairs, engineering in 159/8 the removal of Ariarathes V and instalment of the
latter's brother, Orophernes, on the throne (App. Syr. 47; Diod. 31.32).
Although in response to embassies from all concerned the Senate suggested that
Cappadocia should be split between Ariarathes and Orophernes, Attalos II of Perga
mon used militar y force to re-establish Ariarathes on the throne in 156 (Gruen 1984:
584±5). This he seems to have done without either permission or response from
Rome. Similarly, some seven years later in 149, there is nothing to suggest that he
looked for senatorial approval before invading Bithynia and helping Nikomedes II to
take the throne from Prusias II (App. Mith. 4±7). It is all in curious contrast with the
rather timid policy he outlined to the priest Attis (above). But the kings of Asia Minor
in this period do seem to have engaged in a degree of independent action against each
other without always eliciting a ver y vigorous reaction from Rome. In 156, for
instance, Prusias II of Bithynia invaded Pergamon, thus star ting a war that lasted
until 154 (Habicht 1956: 101±10; Gruen 1984: 586±9). Prusias repeatedly ignored
the rather tame ef forts of the embassies despatched by the Senate to bring about a
cessation of hostilities, and even maltreated the Roman ambassadors (Polyb. 33.7).
When his friendship and alliance with Rome were cancelled, however, he must have
realized that he was not going to have an entirely free hand; but it was only the
formation of a coalition by Attalos, involving Mithradates IV of Pontos and Ariarathes
V of Cappadocia, coupled with yet another Roman embassy, that finally brought his
defiance to an end. Prusias had to pay an indemnity, but the treaty ending the war
really only restored the status quo. Such senatorial lethargy may have encouraged
Ariarathes and Attalos at about this time to attack the city of Priene, which appealed
for assistance first to Rhodes and then Rome (Polyb. 33.6; Ager 1996: no. 143).
Roman diplomacy perhaps helped to restrain the aggressors in the end, but Ariarathes
and Attalos had displayed no hesitation in attacking in the first place. And while
Pergamon and Bithynia were conducting their war, Rhodes and Crete were also
engaged in a war (155±153) that attracted little urgent interest in Rome (Gruen
1984: 578±9). Both sides first appealed to the Achaian League for help, presumably
on the assumption that they would get more ef fective attention there than from the
Senate: in due course they did turn to Rome, and again, it may have been a Roman
embassy that hastened an end to the war, but it seems to be the case that up till this
point the combatants had set about the business of war against each other with no
obvious concerns for Roman reaction (Ager 1996: no. 144).
3 The Revolt of Andriskos and the Achaian War
This sor t of inter-state wrangling was possible for one ver y good reason: it of fered no
real threat to Rome's ultimate authority. But if Greek states harboured any doubts
about the limits of their independence, two wars in the 140s will have set them right
To the Death of Mithradates 77



on the matter. The first reinforced the lesson of Pydna: direct militar y challenge to
Roman authority would meet the full force of Rome's militar y might. In 150±148 a
pretender to the Macedonian throne, named Andriskos, offered just such a challenge,
although it took the Senate some time to realize what was happening (Gruen 1984:
431±3; Kallet-Marx 1995: 31±6). Andriskos claimed to be a son of Perseus, and in a
remarkably shor t time, with Thracian backing, managed to win control of Macedon
and threaten Thessaly. Polybios was perplexed at the turn of events (36.10; 17):
Andriskos had appeared from nowhere, `dropped out of the sky', as he famously put
it, and he could not understand why the Macedonians suppor ted him. The rapidity of
his success may have been surprising, but there can be little doubt about the main
reasons for Andriskos' appeal: the Macedonians missed their monarchy and their
independence. Although there is only little explicit statement of hostility to Rome
(Zonar. 9.28), it is hard to imagine that this was not one of the driving forces behind
the Macedonian revolt. Their last two kings had been defeated by Roman armies and
the Senate had abolished their monarchy and deprived them of their political free
dom. Even if they were not ruled directly by Rome, they knew who their main enemy
was. Not surprisingly they did not like their subjection to Roman authority, and when
an oppor tunity to redress the situation presented itself, they embraced it. In 150
Rome sent a single legate, P. Scipio Nasica, to solve the problem diplomatically: he
saw that the matter was a great deal more serious than the Senate had realized, and
the following year the praetor P. Iuventius Thalna was despatched with a legion, only
to suffer a shocking defeat and death. Finally in 148 the Senate responded adequately:
a Pergamene fleet and two legions under the command of Q. Caecilius Metellus
brought Andriskos' challenge to an end. Although it is usually assumed that in the
wake of the Andriskos af fair Macedon now became a Roman province, under direct
Roman rule, it may be that the Senate simply decided on a regular militar y commit
ment to the defence of Macedon's frontier with Thrace (Kallet-Marx 1995: 11± 41).
There were aspects of the other war of this period more dif ficult for the Greeks to
interpret. After a long histor y of loyal suppor t whenever they were called on for help,
in 146 the Achaian League fought a suicidal war against Rome, ending in defeat, the
destruction of Corinth and the dissolution of the league (Polyb. 38.9±18; Paus. 7.14±
16). What happened? Did they themselves simply devise a disastrous new policy
towards Rome, disturbed by social pressures perhaps (Fuks 1970) and driven by a
new breed of anti-Roman politician? Or did Rome deliberately provoke them by
deciding to dismember the Achaian League (Larsen 1968: 492; W. Harris 1979:
240±4)? Or did a series of tragic miscalculations carr y both Rome and the Achaians
into a war neither side had really intended (Gruen 1976)? The sources will hardly
allow a definitive answer, but the Achaian relationship with Rome was an uncomfor t
able one, made all the more uncomfor table by the league's own internal problems and
the arbitrar y exercise of senatorial power. In the 160s and 150s the Achaians repeat
edly sought the return from Italy of their countr ymen depor ted after Pydna. Although
they finally succeeded in 150 (Polyb. 35.6), they were refused before, in Polybios'
opinion (30.32.8), to keep them obedient to the strongly pro-Roman Kallikrates.
The frequency of their requests indicates that the Achaians, understandably, regarded
it as a pressing matter. In addition to this source of bitterness some of Rome's
diplomatic inter vention must have tested Achaian patience. In 164, for instance, an
old argument between Spar ta and Megalopolis flared up again and Roman arbitration
78 Brian McGing



was sought (Ager 1996: no. 135). The Senate sent C. Sulpicius Gallus and M'. Sergius
(Polyb. 31.1.6±7). In Pausanias' hostile account ± our only source ± Gallus behaved
badly, refused to adjudicate and handed the matter over to Kallikrates (7.11.1±3). If
this might be taken to mean that Rome simply reasser ted the league's authority to
manage its own af fairs, Pausanias' continuation of the stor y would be dif ficult to
reconcile with such an interpretation: the Senate not only suppor ted the wish of the
citizens of Pleuron to secede from the league, he says, but also encouraged Gallus to
detach as many additional states as possible. Clearly nothing came of this, but we are in
a period only shor tly after Pydna, when we can see Rome throwing her weight about
elsewhere; and even if Pausanias' narrative is deemed unreliable in detail, perhaps it
correctly reflects a far from tolerant Senate, quite prepared to threaten the Achaian
League. A decade later (156±5), when Athens and Oropos were in dispute, things
seem to have been more calmly managed (Ager 1996: no. 141): the Senate was
prepared to delegate the details of the arbitration to Sikyon and to see Achaian
authority upheld, even if they did tinker with the details by reducing the fine imposed
on Athens from 500 to 100 talents.
By 150/149, when once again the relationship of Spar ta to the league emerged
as the central issue of Achaian politics, there was no par ticular sign of impending
trouble. The league's wish to hold on to a reluctant Spar ta was an old problem
and there was no reason to think that it would not be sor ted out, at least temporarily,
with the usual mixture of hostilities and arbitration. But the Achaians were unlucky
with the timing of their problem: the revolt of Andriskos in Macedonia not only
brought a Roman army to Greece, it also preoccupied the Senate for the best par t of
two years, and the resulting Roman inattention to events in the Peloponnese may
have misled the Achaians into thinking that they could sor t out matters exactly as they
pleased (Derow 1989: 321±2). Cer tainly the Achaian leaders began militar y oper
ations against Spar ta, ignoring Metellus' advice to wait for the arrival of a Roman
embassy. When an embassy did finally arrive, in the summer of 147, its leader, L.
Aurelius Orestes, brought a brutal message from the Senate: Spar ta, Corinth, Argos,
Herakleia and Orchomenos were to be detached from the league (Paus. 7.14±15).
The Achaians must have been stunned, as they had no reason to think that they had
fallen so foul of Rome. The usual explanation of the Senate's action is that they lost
patience with the league's stubbornness and quarrelsome internal relations, and
issued an ultimatum which they knew would lead to war. But Polybios' repor t
(38.9.6) about Sextus Julius Caesar explaining to the Achaians that this was all just
meant to frighten them into a less presumptuous, more pliable mode of behaviour,
not to dissolve the league or force them into war, might just be true (Gruen 1976): as
we saw above, if we can believe Pausanias, exactly the same sor t of threat had been
made in 164. On this occasion, war resulted because, in Polybios' opinion (38.10±
13), Kritolaos deliberately led the Achaians into it. When war was declared on Spar ta,
it was really against Rome (Polyb. 38.13.6). And yet the possibility remains that this
was still a game of bluf f and that even right at the end the Achaians were shocked to
find themselves at war with Rome: Polybios himself argues that Diaios and Kritolaos
were labouring under the misconception that Rome was afraid of war with the
Achaians on account of their campaigns in Spain and Africa and would put up with
anything (38.10.10). At any rate when the league army moved against Herakleia they
encountered Metellus and his army, and disaster came swiftly. Three defeats in rapid
To the Death of Mithradates 79



succession saw of f the Achaian challenge and left Corinth exposed: it was sacked and
then burnt to the ground (Paus. 7.16±17).
4 Continuity and Change after the Achaian War
Traditionally 146 has often been seen as representing the end of independent Greek
histor y. Events cer tainly conspire to make it look a time of great significance. Macedon
defeated yet again and the central Greeks humbled, Corinth destroyed. By happy, or
unhappy, coincidence, Car thage too was, of course, razed to the ground in 146.
Polybios' decision to end his histor y at this point leaves a loud silence in our coverage
of the subsequent period: he adds considerable authority to the notion of the year
146 as a turning point. And with the standard modern interpretation of events in
Greece being that after the defeat of Andriskos Macedon was turned into a Roman
province, to which much of Greece was attached after the defeat of the Achaian
League, the case looks secure: 146 represents a vital moment in the decline of Greece
and the rise of Rome. This was always a view, however, that regarded Greek histor y as
primarily that of the Greek mainland. There is no doubt that the Achaian war marked
another increment in the growth of Roman power, but many of the states of the
Greek east were not directly af fected by it, and it can be argued that in the period after
146 continuity outweighed change.
Just as after Pydna, so after the defeat of the Achaian League, there was bound to
be a reckoning for the losers. It was administered by the victorious Roman general,
L. Mummius, and a senatorial commission sent to assist him. The details are preser ved
in a problematic and much discussed passage of Pausanias (7.16.9±10). He gets one
thing ver y clearly wrong: he says Roman governors were now regularly assigned to
Achaia, but we know this was not the case until 27 B C . As well as destroying the
defences of cities that opposed Rome, Mummius, we are told, suppressed democra
cies, imposed a tribute on Greece, forbade the rich from holding property outside
their own state, disbanded the leagues and ordered the Boiotians and Achaians to pay
indemnities to the states they attacked. Pausanias adds that not many years later Rome
took pity on the Greeks, restored the leagues and the right to hold proper ty abroad
and remitted some of the fines Mummius had imposed. Quite how much of this, if
any, Pausanias has got right, is dif ficult to say (Kallet-Marx 1995: 57±96). It is not at
all clear that Greece became tributar y at this time, although it is hard to imagine that
the Achaians did not have to pay a war indemnity ± and to Rome, not just to other
Greek states. That there were some constitutional measures imposed is confirmed by
Polybios who was instructed by the senatorial commission to go round the cities and
explain anything they did not understand `until they got used to the constitution
and the laws' (39.5.2). An inscription from the city of Dyme also mentions `the
constitution given to the Achaians by the Romans' (RDGE 43, trans. Sherk 50).
Whether this refers to a new constitution for the Achaian League, or for the individ
ual cities that had formerly made up the league, is not clear; but from a practical point
of view it does not really matter. For whether or not the league was in some form
allowed to revive ± and there are later references to it, although nothing secure until
the early first centur y ± to all intents and purposes it disappears from the stage of
political histor y as a leading actor. This is hardly surprising. When the Macedonians
were defeated in 167 Rome suppressed their monarchy, the driving force behind the
80 Brian McGing



militar y challenge to Rome. Similarly in 146 the Achaians made their challenge, lost
and paid the price: it was inconceivable that the Senate would leave a politically
ef fective Achaian League in place.
This much was to be expected, and its impor tance should not be underestimated,
but the idea that something fundamental changed rests primarily on modern notions
of Roman imperial `annexation': Macedon is annexed and turned into a `province' in
148, and Greece made subject to the authority of its governor in 146. In other words
the whole status of the Greeks changes, and they now become, in a way they were not
before, par t of `the Roman empire'. This standard interpretation has been challenged
recently with some force (Kallet-Marx 1995: 11±56). After 146 Macedonia was
almost cer tainly assigned regularly to a Roman commander as a provincia, but as a
provincia in the sense of a commission; and the commission, so the argument would
run, was the defence of Macedonia's Balkan frontier, not the administration of an
annexed territor y. This will not have necessitated any change in the status either of
Macedonia, or of Greece. The Roman commander on the spot was naturally a focus
of attention in the region and there are records of his involvement in the disputes and
af fairs of Greece. But this no more demonstrates that Greece was now formally
subject to Roman jurisdiction than any of the other examples of proconsular inter
vention in Greek af fairs before 146 demonstrated it. Informally, of course, it was
another matter. If the genesis of the Achaian War was dif ficult for the Greeks to
understand, its message, yet another reaf firmation of the post-Pydna world, was not:
they were subject to the imperium of Rome, which meant, ultimately, that they had to
do what they were told. On the other hand this authority was more of a distant threat
than a constant pressure, and they were not told to do ver y much. For most of the
Greek world business went on as usual.
Some even benefited from the outcome (Kallet-Marx 1995: 90±3). Profuse votes
of thanks to Mummius may have been more strategic than sincere, but reluctant
members of the Achaian League, such as Spar ta, Elis, Argos and Herakleia, must have
been delighted finally to be freed from its control. Strabo (10.5.4) tells us that the
destruction of its trading rival, Corinth, was of great advantage to Delos. The
Athenians, who before the war had been making aggressive moves on Oropos,
probably did not win possession of it subsequently, but may have been rewarded
with some disputed islands instead. In general Athens' close and friendly relations
with Rome, and with the monarchies of the Greek east, flourished in the second half
of the centur y (Habicht 1997: 269±87). Greek states also continued to fall out with
each other and look to third par ties, sometimes Rome, sometimes not, for arbitra
tion. The land dispute of two Thessalian communities, Italos and Thebes (145±137
B C ), was submitted to Makon of Larisa (Ager 1996: no. 153), while a panel of judges
from Asia Minor initially arbitrated between Nar thakion and Melitaia (c. 143. Ager
1996: no. 154). When Rhodes and Stratonikeia fell out, the disputants thought
about going to Rome, but decided instead to submit the case to the Karian city of
Bargylia (c. 130. Ager 1996: no. 160). If a problem did make its way to the Senate the
fathers usually established ground rules and handed on the details to someone else.
When Spar ta, for instance, encouraged perhaps by the outcome of the Achaian war,
took her old dispute with Messenia to Rome, the Senate asked Miletos to give
judgement on the basis of who possessed the disputed land when Mummius came
to Greece: 600 judges found in favour of Messenia (c. 138. Ager 1996: no. 159). For
To the Death of Mithradates 81



persistent aggression against each other it would be hard to beat the record of the
Cretans in the second half of the second centur y (Chaniotis 1996: 49±56). Gor tyn
and Knossos were the leading troublemakers, but their allies ± Hierapytna and Olos
(Gor tyn), Lato and Itanos (Knossos) ± were not slow to take up arms in suppor t, or
indeed in their own separate interests. The Senate did inter vene from time to time
(with mixed success), par ticularly in the outbreak of hostilities between Hierapytna
and Itanos in 115±114 (Chaniotis 1996: 333±7; Ager 1996: no. 158), but the
evidence, mostly epigraphic, gives the distinct impression of the states involved
fighting, making and breaking treaties, generally going about their business, with
only scant regard for Rome.
Cretan af fairs were perhaps too local to threaten the imperium of Rome and worr y
the Senate unduly, but it is slightly more surprising to see in the same period the
af fairs of the Jews, Seleukids and Ptolemies inextricably linked in a series of intrigues,
alliances and wars that elicited little reaction in Rome. The expansionist policies of the
Hasmonaean princes (Rajak 1994: 287±96), par ticularly John Hyrkanos and Alexan
der Jannaeus, were pursued within the bounds of the Seleukid empire, and, therefore,
presumably, not of major concern to the Senate. It is possible that when besieging
Jerusalem in 135/4 (Jos. AJ 13.236± 46) Antiochos VII Sidetes received a diplomatic
shot across his bows ± if the senatus consultum repor ted by Josephos (AJ 13.257±64)
belongs at this time ± but in view of the careful watch Rome kept on eastern
Mediterranean events in the first half of the centur y, it is interesting to obser ve
what seems to be a diminishing concern in the second half. In the final two decades
of the centur y such apparent indif ference may have had more to do with the crises in
Numidia and on Rome's nor thern frontier than with a real lack of interest, but it is
also the case that by this stage, indeed well before, the two greatest Hellenistic royal
houses, the Seleukids and Ptolemies, were in an advanced state of decline. Both were
plagued by extreme dynastic dissension, at times exacerbated, as we have seen, by
Roman meddling. In the case of the Seleukids the Jewish drive for independence
added a fur ther debilitating factor. These distractions fatally weakened the defence of
their empire against Par thian encroachment, and with the defeat and death of Anti
ochos VII Sidetes in 129 the Seleukids were all but finished: the once mighty empire
now comprised Cilicia and nor thern Syria (Habicht 1989: 362±73: Shipley 2000:
320±5). The Ptolemies faced no such foreign threat, but their internal problems
were, if anything, even more acute. On an embassy to the east in 140/39 (or possibly
144/43), Scipio Aemilianus noted what Polybios had earlier obser ved, that Egypt
had the potential to become a great power if ever it found wor thy rulers (Diod.
33.28b.1±3). This it singularly failed to do, and its political histor y from this time is a
sad and complicated stor y of decline ± civil war, revolt, dynastic intrigue, local rivalr y,
administrative breakdown (D. J. Thompson 1994a: Shipley 2000: 207±13). Perhaps
symbolic of Egyptian weakness is the attitude of deference to a Roman senator
required of local of ficials organizing his visit to the Fayum in 112 B C :
Lucius Memmius, a Roman senator, who occupies a position of great dignity and
honour, is making the journey from Alexandria to the Arsinoite nome to see the sights.
Let him be received with special magnificence and take care that at the proper spots the
guest-chambers be prepared and the landing-places to them be got ready with great care,
and that the gifts of hospitality mentioned below be presented to him at the landing
82 Brian McGing



places . . . In general take the utmost pains in ever ything that the visitor may be satis
fied . . . (Sel. Pap. II. 416; BD 69)
It would be a mistake to read too much into the hospitable reception of an impor tant
person, but in the course of the second centur y institutional recognition and accept
ance of Roman domination is increasingly evident. The cult of the goddess Roma
developed and spread round the Greek east in this period (Mellor 1975: 27±110).
How elaborate and central to the life of a city it could be is well illustrated by an
inscription from Miletos of about 130 B C , which describes the working of the cult
there (LSAM 49, trans. Sherk 41). A regular timetable for sacrifice to `the People of
the Romans and to Roma' is specified, often in conjunction with a special occasion,
such as the entr y into of fice of the new gymnasiarchs; and Roman Games are
established. `The people of Rome' crop up on inscriptions from all over the Greek
world; and increasingly they are referred to as `the common benefactors' (Erskine
1994). A practice develops, par ticularly in the second half of the centur y, of Greek
states, even ver y minor ones, seeking a formal treaty of alliance with Rome (Kallet
Marx 1995: 184±97). Such diplomatic niceties ± the terms treat both signatories as
equal par tners ± had little practical ef fect, but were probably reassuring expressions of
loyalty for the Greeks to be able to make and the Senate to accept. Rather more than a
diplomatic nicety was the strange decision we witness for the first time in 155B C of
cer tain Hellenistic kings to bequeath their kingdom to Rome. In that year Ptolemy
VIII Physkon published his will as follows:
May it be allowed me, with the favour of the gods, to take vengeance fittingly upon those
who contrived the unholy plot against me and sought to deprive me not only of my
kingship but also of my life. If anything human should befall me before I leave successors
to my kingship, I leave the kingdom that belongs to me (i.e. Cyrene) to the Romans,
with whom I have from the beginning truly maintained friendship and alliance; . . . ( SEG
9.7; Austin 230)
Even if this was only a strategy to protect himself against fur ther assassination
attempts, and he never thought that Cyrene would really fall to Rome, it was still a
striking, and, one would think, far from obvious notion. How would the idea even
occur to a Ptolemy? It is no doubt witness to the way in which Hellenistic monarchs
regarded their kingdoms as personal possessions, but it is also distinctly defeatist in
conception. There is no fight left in Physkon, indeed the Romans are not even the
enemy: they are viable heirs to the kingdom of the Ptolemies. He seems to accept as
inevitable the dominance of Rome. The will was never activated, as Physkon lived
long and fathered heirs, but when Attalos III of Pergamon died in 133 having
bequeathed his kingdom to Rome, the result was ver y dif ferent indeed: the Senate
accepted the bequest (RDGE 11, trans. Austin 214), and established for the first time
a Roman presence in Asia.
We are not told what the still youthful but heirless Attalos intended with his will,
and there is much debate, but the idea that he was taking defensive measures against
dynastic challenge, just like Ptolemy VIII Physkon, is an attractive one (Gruen 1984:
592±6). Aristonikos, supposedly an illegitimate son of Eumenes II, made his bid for
the throne only shor tly after Attalos' death: perhaps it was clear beforehand that he
To the Death of Mithradates 83



was already planning to contest the throne, and that Attalos, who had no expectation
of dying in the near future, was tr ying to discourage him with the terms of the will.
There is disagreement on how keen the Senate was to take up the inheritance (e.g.
W. Harris 1979: 147±9; A. Sher win-White 1984: 80±4), but once Attalos had
involved them in the future of Pergamon, it was no longer a local matter to be decided
locally: Aristonikos' defiance constituted a militar y challenge to the imperium of
Rome, and a vigorous, probably armed, Roman inter vention became inevitable.
Aristonikos enjoyed some success at the beginning ± Phokaia and Leukai went over
to his side (Strabo 14.1.38; Just. 37.1.1), and he was able to capture Myndos, Samos
and Kolophon (Florus 1.35.4) ± so there must have been elements in the state who
saw their best interests ser ved by a continuation of the monarchy (Macedonian
colonists of the interior perhaps ± Collins 1980: 83±7). Strabo tells us that he also
sought the suppor t of the poor and of slaves, probably when he found he was losing,
or could not find, more influential suppor t elsewhere; but it is now generally thought
unlikely that he presented himself as a great social revolutionar y (Gruen 1984: 597).
Opposition came especially from the Greek cities of the coast, many of which, like
Pergamon (OGIS 338, trans. Austin 211), had perhaps been declared `free' in
Attalos' will; and in due course the kings of Cappadocia, Bithynia, Paphlagonia and
Pontos entered the fray when the Senate asked for their help. The fathers may, as so
often, have been slow to catch up with events ± neither consul was assigned Asia as a
province in 132, and when one of the consuls of 131, P. Licinius Crassus, was sent out
with an army he was defeated and killed ± but they eventually brought over whelming
force to bear: in 130 and 129 Marcus Perperna and Manius Aquillius defeated
Aristonikos and ended the war.
After the war Manius Aquillius and a senatorial commission of ten settled the af fairs
of the region (Magie 1950: 154±8; Kallet-Marx 1995: 109±22). Loyal kings were
rewarded with parcels of Attalid territor y ± Mithradates V of Pontos was given
Phr ygia and the Cappadocians got L ykaonia ± but the rest, allowing for the freedom
of cer tain cities, became par t of the new Roman province of Asia. There might be
disagreement about the exact date of provincialization, but there can be no doubt
that Aquillius set in motion a process that soon saw Attalos' kingdom become par t of
the territor y of the Roman empire, territor y to be governed directly, exploited
economically and protected militarily. It is theoretically possible that if Aristonikos
had not appeared, Rome might have dealt with Attalos' bequest dif ferently, but in
bringing order to the disruption caused by Aristonikos' bid for power the Senate
confirmed their decision to take a physical stake in Asia. Another Hellenistic kingdom
had disappeared to be replaced by Rome. On a vastly larger scale the following half
centur y would see the same process repeated.
5 The Mithradatic Wars
While Rome was sor ting out its new territor y of Pergamon, in the royal house of
Pontos there was growing up the young prince whose militar y challenge to Rome
would do so much to ensure the demise of a politically independent Hellenistic
world. Mithradates VI Eupator Dionysos succeeded to the throne when his father
was assassinated in 120. He belonged to a powerful and noble Persian family,
probably directly related to the great Darius himself, which in the fifth and fourth
84 Brian McGing



centuries had held sway as dynasts over the regions of Mysia and Mariandynia on the
Propontis and fur ther east along the south shore of the Black Sea (Boswor th and
Wheatley 1998). Towards the end of the four th centur y one of their number, the
Mithradates later known as Ktistes (`founder'), was forced to retire to the mountains
of Paphlagonia from where he began to build what was to emerge in the course of the
third centur y as the kingdom of Pontos. We know little of its early histor y (McGing
1986: 15± 42; Hind 1994a: 129±33). Although there is no reason to think that the
royal family denied or played down their Iranian origins and Achaimenid connections,
they also presented a Greek face to the world: Greek coins, Greek diplomatic prac
tices, marriage alliances with the Seleukids all placed the kingdom firmly in the world
of Hellenistic monarchies. Eupator's grandfather Pharnakes (
c
. 196±170/155) was
the first to bring Pontos to the attention of Rome (section 2 above), and both
Mithradates IV and V treated their `friendship' with Rome seriously, the latter's
loyalty in the war against Aristonikos being rewarded, as we have seen, with the
territor y of Phr ygia.
When Eupator had established himself securely on the throne (by about 116), his
first major initiative was across the Black Sea in the Crimea where the citizens of
Chersonesos, their city sacked by hostile Scythian neighbours, invited him to cham
pion their cause (Strabo 7.4.3). A remarkable inscription (
SIG
3
709, trans. BD 56)
records the resulting campaigns of his general, Diophantos, who subjected the whole
area, including the Bosporan kingdom (Strabo 7.4.4), to Pontic r ule. The chronology
of the rest of Mithradates' expansion in the Euxine cannot be fixed, but the literar y,
epigraphic and numismatic evidence shows that in due course he came to control,
either directly or indirectly, almost its entire circuit (de Callatay È 1997: 245±64).
Aggressive ambitions in Asia Minor, however, were more dangerous (Hind 1994a:
140± 4; McGing 1986: 66±88). As Pharnakes' war against his neighbours had dem
onstrated, hostile coalitions could be formed and there was always the threat of
Rome. Probably early in his reign Mithradates murdered his sister Laodike's husband
Ariarathes VI of Cappadocia, thus enabling her to r ule as regent for her own young
son Ariarathes VII, but after that we hear little of Asia Minor until, taking advantage
of Rome's nor thern dif ficulties in the last decade of the centur y, Mithradates and his
Bithynian neighbour, Nikomedes III, car ved up Paphlagonia between them. They
ignored a Roman order to withdraw; Nikomedes installed his own son as king and
Mithradates annexed par t of Galatia. This happy alliance between the two kings did
not last long. In about 103/102 we find Nikomedes invading Cappadocia and
mar r ying Laodike, only for Mithradates to expel them both, restore his nephew
Ariarathes VII briefly, but then murder him and declare his own young son as king
(Ariarathes IX).
Up to this point, about 100 BC
, Rome had largely ignored these dynastic intrigues.
The famous embassy to the east of Gaius Marius in 99/8 (Plut.
Mar
. 31), however,
may show a change of senatorial attitude. `Be stronger than the Romans,' he told
Mithradates, `or obey their commands in silence'. The king took the latter option
when in about 96 the Senate ordered him out of Cappadocia, Nikomedes having
stirred the pot by producing a pretender to the Cappadocian throne and appealing to
Rome. Cappadocia was declared `free' (Paphlagonia too), but the Cappadocians in
fact wanted a king and chose Ariobarzanes. Although chronological uncer tainties
make it ver y dif ficult to follow the precise course of events in this whole period
To the Death of Mithradates
85



(de Callatay È 1997: 186±214), it is clear that Ariobarzanes had dif ficulty taking
possession of, or holding onto, his throne in the face of a Cappadocian inter vention
by Mithradates' new ally and son-in-law, Tigranes king of Armenia. Rome's response
± the restoration (or installation) of Ariobarzanes by an army under the command of
L. Cornelius Sulla ± was sensational. When threatened directly, by Andriskos, for
instance, or Aristonikos, the Senate had always been quite prepared to fight, but they
had previously shown no inclination to use force of arms in dealing with the local
af fairs of the Anatolian kings. The message to Mithradates must have been cr ystal
clear. If he had not already decided on war with Rome, he surely did now. He waited
until Italy was convulsed by the Social War, and then annexed Bithynia and Cappa
docia. The inept Roman diplomacy that followed cast Rome in the role of aggressor
and Mithradates of aggrieved victim.
This was perhaps par t of the reason for the remarkable degree of success he
achieved initially. In outline the stor y of the war is simply told (A. Sher win-White
1984: 121± 48). Mithradates' armies swept across Asia Minor, easily defeating the first
line of Roman and allied opposition. They met resistance from cer tain cities, usually
swiftly overcome, except in the case of Rhodes, and subsequently Patara in L ykia,
both of which Mithradates besieged but failed to capture (App.
Mith
. 24±7). Others,
like Kos, Magnesia, Ephesos and Mytilene, of fered an enthusiastic welcome to the
invading forces (App.
Mith
. 21). With most of Asia Minor in his possession Mithra
dates then moved into Greece, where astonishingly, given their previous loyalty to
Rome, the Athenians went over to his side. The real test, however, was still to come.
Mithradates' success to this point was largely a product of per fect timing ± Rome was
far too busy with the Social War to do anything about him ± but sooner or later he
was going to have to face the full force of a Roman response. It arrived in the summer
of 87, when Sulla landed in Greece with five legions. Suppor t for Mithradates melted
away and Sulla drove the Pontic forces into Athens. They held out stoutly over the
winter of 87/86, but on the 1 March 86, the city fell. In two subsequent battles Sulla
was also victorious, and Mithradates withdrew to Asia. Here he again met with defeat
at the hands of the Roman general, Fimbria, and after lengthy negotiations, made
peace with Sulla in 85. He had to pay a war indemnity, return prisoners, relinquish all
his conquests and merely confine himself to his own kingdom ± a settlement that even
Sulla's own troops recognized as lenient (Plut.
Sull
. 24).
In the end victor y was a relatively straightfor ward matter ± the Roman army was
quite simply a mightier fighting force than anything the Pontic side could muster ±
but more interesting is the degree of suppor t Mithradates won in the first two years of
the war. For his own Anatolian subjects, and indeed for other inhabitants of the
region, the respectability of his Achaimenid family connections gave him great
authority; and he had undoubtedly made himself ver y attractive to the Greeks
(McGing 1986: 89±108). He championed the cause of the Black Sea colonies against
their barbarian neighbours; he also built up a reputation in the Aegean and mainland
Greek world as a leading philhellenic benefactor; his cour t was full of Greeks and, in
most respects, was str uctured along standard Hellenistic lines; he created an image of
himself as a new Alexander come to rescue the Greeks; and, perhaps above all, he was
successful. When faced with the dreadful dilemma of whom to suppor t in a war
between Rome and the rich, power ful and civilized kingdom of Pontos, those who
86
Brian McGing



chose the latter probably did so, at least in par t, for the simple reason that they
thought they were backing the winner. There was also the pragmatic consideration
for the Asiatic Greeks that Mithradates was the man on the spot: with a victorious
Pontic army at the city gates and no hope of Rome's protection, it called for a ver y
stout hear t to deny the king of Pontos. And how many wanted Rome's protection? It
seems clear that Rome had managed to make herself ver y unpopular since the
creation of the province of Asia, in par ticular because of the activities of her tax
farmers (Diod. 37.5±6; Kallet-Marx 1995: 138±48). The famous massacre of Romans
and Italians ordered by Mithradates in 88 (App. Mith. 22±3), an order carried out
with no little enthusiasm by some of the Greek states, is usually seen as evidence of
accumulated hatred for Rome. While this idea may have been overplayed by scholars
to a cer tain extent (Kallet-Marx 1995: 153±8), it would be dif ficult to disagree with
Appian's conclusion that the cause of the atrocity was more hatred of the Romans
than fear of the king.
It would also be dif ficult to exaggerate just how damaging and disruptive the war
had been for the states of the Greek east. It did not matter which side they took,
nearly all lost out at some stage. Those who resisted Mithradates were punished by
him, but then rewarded by Sulla ± Stratonikeia, for instance (App. Mith. 21: RDGE
18, trans. Sherk 63) ± while a pro-Mithradatic stance met with heavy penalties after
the war ± reprisals, a massive fine and the billeting of Roman troops during the winter
of 85/84 (App. Mith. 61±2; Plut. Sull. 25). Over ten years later the 20,000 talent
indemnity that Sulla imposed on the Greek cities of Asia had been paid twice over, but
so high were the rates of interest at which the Greeks were forced to borrow that the
total debt was now 120,000 talents (Plut. Luc. 20.4). Asia truly `had her fill of miser y'
(App. Mith. 63). The Athenians fared no better, but for a city which had identified so
closely with the Pontic cause ± Mithradates functioned as one of the mint magistrates
in 87/86 B C and may well have been elected Eponymous Archon the previous year ±
they can hardly have expected other wise (Habicht 1997: 303±21). Their chief
punishment was the cruel siege and murderously destructive sacking of the city.
Sulla also seems to have forced new laws on them, or made some sort of consti
tutional inter vention (App. Mith. 39). Although in the wake of the war Rome
acquired no new territor y, Appian does tell us that the majority of people in Asia
Minor, Greece and Macedonia were now for the first time made tributar y (Mith.
118). This represents a huge increase in Rome's stake in the east. Her authority in the
region had been shaken to its foundations, but although Sulla made no infrastructural
changes to ensure it did not happen again, the range and whole process of war
produced in the aftermath a much more intrusive Roman presence.
Mithradates retired to Pontos with his prestige severely damaged, but his ambition
fully intact. He had to deal with revolt in his Colchian and Bosporan domains (App.
Mith. 64), but also continued to intrigue adventurously against Cappadocia. It may
have been in response to this activity that Sulla's legate L. Licinius Murena made a
series of raids on Pontic territor y, known as the Second Mithradatic War (Glew
1981). The crisis lasted from 83 to 81. Mithradates finally reacted to Murena's
bullying and inflicted a sharp defeat on him, but neither Rome nor Pontos wanted
war just yet: Sulla called of f Murena and relations were patched up. The final
confrontation, the Third Mithradatic War, arose in connection with Bithynia. When
To the Death of Mithradates 87



Nikomedes IV died in 74 he left his kingdom to Rome, a bequest the Senate
immediately accepted (Eutrop. 6.6.1). Whatever the exact excuse he used, Mithra
dates was not going to put up with this, and in the spring of 73 his forces swept
through Paphlagonia and invaded the new Roman province (A. Sher win-White 1994:
238±70). Plutarch (Luc. 7) reports that the Bithynians welcomed the invaders and
that disaf fection with Rome broke out in Asia, but unlike at the beginning of the first
war, this time Rome was prepared: two Roman proconsuls and an army were waiting.
Although the Roman fleet was easily defeated at Chalkedon, the entire Pontic
advance foundered at the first major obstacle it encountered. Mithradates put virtu
ally his whole effort into capturing the city of Kyzikos on the Propontis, but was
outwitted by the able L. Licinius Lucullus and forced to withdraw in disorder (App.
Mith. 72±6). This was by no means the last throw of the dice for Mithradates, but it
was the last serious challenge he posed. In some five years of campaigning Lucullus
pursued him through Bithynia and Pontos, and on into Armenia, where the king took
refuge with his son-in-law, Tigranes. When Lucullus' victorious offensive ran out of
political support at Rome and stalled, Mithradates slipped back to Pontos at the end
of 68 and defeated the occupying Roman forces. It was only a temporar y reprieve,
however. In 66 Gnaeus Pompeius was appointed to the command and swiftly routed
Mithradates who fled to his Bosporan kingdom. Here in 63, amid stories that he was
planning to invade Italy by land, like a Hannibal from the east, he finally succumbed
to the treacher y of his son, Pharnakes, and committed suicide.
The war had not touched Greece this time and the Greek cities of Asia had largely
escaped too, but the campaigns of Lucullus and Pompey brought Roman arms into
Pontos, to the Caucasus, to Armenia and south into Palestine. This time there was to
be no retreat, no return to the status quo. Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean
was a world now owned by Rome, and Pompey set about institutionalizing this
ownership with the formation of new provinces in Bithynia-Pontus and Syria, and
the establishment of compliant `client' kings to rule in Rome's interests (Eilers, this
volume). It would be wrong to blame Mithradates for all of this: there were other
factors drawing Rome inexorably eastwards. The Senate had, for instance, long been
exercised by the problem of piracy. A special piracy command in Cilicia had been
given to M. Antonius in 102, and an impor tant inscription preser ves the text of a law
of about 100 B C , which, among other things, established Cilicia as a provincia to deal
with the pirates (Hassal et al. 1974; Sherk 55). In 74 Cretan piracy was targeted by
the Senate, and the culmination of this process was Pompey's massive, and brilliantly
successful, command in 67 (Gabrielsen, this volume). Campaigns against the Scor
disci and Thracians in the last decade of the second centur y and fur ther of fensives in
the Balkans and western Black Sea area during the 70s, show a continuing and
growing Roman commitment in that region (Kallet-Marx 1995: 223±7; 296±9).
But although Rome had interests that would probably have seen her in due course
take over the eastern Mediterranean anyway, Mithradates was the catalyst for the
process. He challenged Rome for possession of Greece and Asia Minor, and to the
victor went the spoils. But to keep the spoils entailed a degree of involvement and
commitment that Rome had not previously exhibited. Mithradates shook the Senate
out of such complacency. In the new order that was created from the chaos of the
Mithradatic wars, the Greek east, in a political sense, disappeared and in its place the
eastern Roman empire emerged.

To the Death of Mithradates 89



CHAPTER SIX
A Roman East:
Pompey's Settlement to the
Death of Augustus
Claude Eilers
1 Pompey's Reorganization
Pompey is said to have boasted that before his campaigns Asia had been Rome's most
distant province, and that now it was in the middle of Rome's dominions (PlinyHN
7.99). His boast was not without justification: his conquests had redrawn the map of
the eastern Mediterranean and his reorganization of the region fundamentally altered
the geopolitical landscape. Some territories now came under Rome's direct control as
provinces; others were given to local dynasts who had proven themselves loyal to
Rome or useful to Pompey, men who could be trusted to govern in Rome's interests.
Much of Mithradates' kingdom of Pontos was added to the existing province of
Bithynia. This new province, which included much of the south coast of the Black
Sea, lasted well into the Empire. Pompey's organizational inter vention here went
beyond the creation of a new province. Where Roman provincial administration had
been successful in the east, it was based on the foundation of the Greek civic system.
Pontos, however, had been a centralized monarchy, and therefore had not developed
such a system. Pompey therefore divided the provincial territor y into cities, each with
a large dependent territor y. Strabo sums up the process for Zela, one of the new cities:
`Pompey added many districts to it and called it a city' (Strabo 12.3.37). Civic
constitutions were created that included Roman features that favoured the wealthy
classes (Magie 1950: 1232± 4).
Where this process was impossible or impractical, Pompey assigned territories to
local dynasts. For example, much of the Pontic hinterland, as well as Armenia Minor,
was given to the Galatian tetrarch, Deiotaros, along with the title `king'. Pompey
showed similar generosity towards Ariobarzanes I, king of Cappadocia. He had been
a loyal ally of Rome for decades, and Pompey confirmed and expanded his kingdom,
though he soon resigned in favour of his son, Ariobarzanes II.
There had been territor y under Roman control in southern Asia Minor for many
years, an area that was sometimes named (somewhat misleadingly up to this point)



`Cilicia'. To this territor y Pompey added Cilicia Pedias and Cilicia Tracheia, making a
new substantial entity, which became one of Rome's most impor tant eastern prov
inces and continued to grow in the coming years. In 58 Cyprus, which had belonged
to Ptolemaic Egypt, was added, and two years after that par t of Phr ygia, which had
been par t of the province of Asia. The new province was impor tant enough that its
governors were ex-consuls, one of which was the famous orator Cicero, whose
correspondence from these years gives us valuable insight into the ways in which
Roman provinces were governed (Treggiari 1978). Cilicia now occupied much of
central Asia Minor, including the strategic highway that ran from Laodikeia, through
L ykaonia to Tarsos and the Cilician gates.
The most dramatic change in Pompey's reorganization took place in Syria, where
the Seleukid dynasty, which had been near death for decades, was not revived. What
remained of the once great empire now became the Roman province Syria. In theor y,
its governors were to hold of fice for one year and then return to Rome. In practice it
was not so: most held of fice for two or three years and used the extended terms to
pursue their own ambitions. In the coming decades, for example, it was used by
Gabinius as a base from which to meddle in Egyptian af fairs, and by Crassus to launch
his ill-fated invasion of Par thia (A. Sher win-White 1984: 271±89).
In the aftermath of this long period of war, many cities were in a sorr y state. For the
most par t, the region now began to recover, profiting from the relative neglect of the
Romans. There were, of course, occasional problems, and Roman governors could be
as unscrupulous as before. For example, the first governor of Asia after Pompey's
return to Rome, L. Valerius Flaccus, demanded money from several cities to build a
fleet to meet the now-diminishing threat of piracy. The ships were never built, and he
apparently pocketed the money. Money was also extor ted elsewhere on other pre
texts, the details of which became public in his trial a few years later (Cic. Flac. 27±
33). Cicero's speech in his defence, the pro Flacco, provides a glimpse of the problems
that a dishonest governor could present to provincials. As dif ficult as such circum
stances were to the specific par ties involved, the sums involved were small compared
to the crushing burdens imposed by Sulla or by Rome's competing factions in the
decades to come. Roman governors had vir tually unlimited freedom of action in their
province: only after they returned to Rome was it possible to revoke their decisions or
seek compensation by bringing action against them in Rome (Lintott 1993: 43±69).
Most cities, however, were not keen to pursue such legal remedies. In the worst cases,
little could be done, and they presumably regarded their losses as an unavoidable cost
of being under Roman rule. Normally, however, Greek cities could iron out dif ficul
ties by getting Roman patrons to inter vene on their behalf (Eilers 2002).
When things went wrong, however, the ef fects could be catastrophic. An instruct
ive example of this is the case of Salamis in Cyprus. It had become par t of the province
of Cilicia in 58. Shor tly after this, when Salamis needed money, it managed to borrow
it from M. Iunius Brutus, who had accompanied his uncle Cato when he annexed the
province for Rome (both were formal patrons of the city). Although the loan was
forbidden under the lex Gabinia, Brutus managed to get the Senate to pass two
decrees that allowed him to circumvent the law's provisions, and a large sum was lent
to Salamis in the name of his agents there at the extor tionate interest rate of 4 per cent
per month. Unsurprisingly, the city's finances soon became seriously compromised,
and by the end of the decade Brutus' agents were using Roman cavalr y (authorized by
Pompey' s Settlement to the Death of Augustus 91



Cicero's predecessor as governor) to intimidate Salamis' council into paying the debt.
At one point the councillors were besieged in their senate house and five of them
star ved to death (Cic. Att. 6.1.6).
There were problems elsewhere, too. In several Cilician cities the economic crisis
was serious enough that they were eight years in arrears in the payment of their taxes.
Special levies were necessar y: in Laodikeia, a poll tax and a tax on doors were
necessar y (Cic. Fam. 3.8.5). Cicero was inclined to blame these problems on the
cupidity of his predecessor, whom he compared at one point to a wild animal (Cic.
Att. 5.16.2). The fact that eight years' taxes were in arrears, however, suggests that
the problem was larger than one extor tionate of ficial.
Through these years Athens remained a loyal ally of Rome. It was legally autono
mous, and free to conduct its own internal af fairs. The Romans, for the most par t,
respected its autonomy. For a shor t period in the mid-50s the authority of the
governor of Macedonia was expanded to include Athens and other cities in Achaia.
This measure, however, was inspired more by the internal politics of Rome than by
any sincere desire to encroach on the autonomy of these cities, and the measure was
shor t-lived (Habicht 1997: 339± 41).
Over the preceding centuries Athens had benefited from the generosity of sympa
thetic monarchs, who were keen to prove their philhellenism by funding civic projects
there. Many of these dynasties no longer existed, but their role was now fulfilled by
prominent Romans. One of these was the financier, T. Pomponius Atticus, a friend
and confidant of Cicero, who made a donation of grain Athens (Cic. Att. 6.6.2).
Others made gifts of money, including such notables as Pompey and Julius Caesar,
both of whom are known to have donated fifty talents (Plut. Pomp. 27.3; Cic. Att.
6.1.25). At the sanctuar y at Eleusis, a monumental gateway built by Ap. Claudius
Pulcher is still to be seen (CIL 3.547 ILLRP 2 1.401). In this regard, Athens seems
to have been unique; similar gifts are rarely attested in other Greek cities.
In 54, the Roman senator M. Licinius Crassus arrived in Syria with a large army,
which he would lead across the Euphrates to attack Par thia. The war was unjusti
fiable. Par thia was at peace with Rome and had abided to the agreement that it had
made with Pompey. The motives arose from personal ambition: Crassus desired
conquests to make his militar y reputation equal to Pompey and Caesar, and Par thia
of fered the best oppor tunity. That, of course, was not completely out of character for
the Romans. Little was accomplished in his first year in Syria: some preliminar y raids
were made against Mesopotamia, and temple treasuries in Jerusalem and Hierapolis
were seized. Nothing in this prepared the Greek east for the shock that came in 53,
when the invasion ended in disaster at Carrhae: most of Crassus' army was lost and he
himself was killed. According to Plutarch (Crass. 33), his head was used as a prop in a
production of the Bacchae: a graphic, though gruesome, illustration both of the wide
dif fusion of Hellenistic culture throughout the near east, and of how deeply the
Par thians were of fended by Crassus' treacher y.
The episode was highly destabilizing to the region. Par thia, which had been non
aggressive and preoccupied with its own problems, was now an open enemy. Luckily
for Rome, internal discord prevented an immediate counter-attack. The new situ
ation, however, led Roman allies to equivocate. The most obvious example of this was
Antiochos of Kommagene, whose kingdom lay on the Euphrates bank and included
strategic approaches to Syria and Cappadocia. He was in a ver y delicate position,
92 Claude Eilers



tr ying to sur vive between two hostile superpowers, and for the moment, safety
dictated co-operation with Par thia (Sullivan 1990: 194±7).
Par thia's militar y response came in 51 B C , when Pakoros, son of the king Orodes,
led a large Par thian army into Syria. The only Roman troops in the region were the
remnants of two of Crassus' legions under the command of Cassius, a subordinate of
Crassus, and two under-strength legions in Cilicia under Cicero. Cassius devised a
simple, though inglorious, strategy to minimize Rome's losses. He withdrew within
the walls of Antioch and refused to give battle. The Par thians lacked the resources and
patience for a long siege, and so after a few weeks they retired. In the summer of the
next year the Par thians again invaded. Again the Romans (now under Calpurnius
Bibulus) held Antioch and waited, and again the Par thians withdrew. For now, the
region was safe from Par thia (A. Sher win-White 1984: 290±7).
2 The Civil War
By the end of the 50s par ts of the Greek east had recovered from the economic and
political crises of the Mithradatic wars. These crises, however, would soon return, as
Rome was plunged into a period of civil strife that would last almost two decades. The
crisis fell especially heavily on the Greek east, which not only became an impor tant
theatre of war, but also an impor tant recruiting ground for troops, and the treasur y
that both sides used to fund their ef for ts.
Soon after Caesar invaded Italy in 49 B C , his opponents withdrew to the provinces,
including Greece and Asia Minor. Here, they began to collect the resources needed to
confront Caesar. Lentulus Crus, the anti-Caesarian consul, for example, was able
to raise two legions in Asia (Caes. BC 3.4). Deiotaros of Galatia, Ariobarzanes of
Cappadocia, and other kings who owed their kingdoms to Pompey's earlier decisions
all furnished the troops asked of them. Maritime cities supplied ships. Money was
extracted from all, even Rome's tax-farmers, and new taxes were introduced to raise
money: a head-tax on slaves and children, and taxes on pillars and doors are
mentioned, as well as `loans' of the next year's taxes. Soldiers and rowers were
conscripted, and, when winter came, Roman troops were billeted (Caes. BC 3.3±5,
31±2).
The showdown, when it came, occurred in southern Thessaly at Pharsalos, with a
decisive victor y for Caesar. Pompey fled. He is said to have considered flight to
Par thia, but in the end escaped to Egypt, over which he claimed a special guardian
ship. The decision, as it turned out, was the wrong one. The Ptolemaic cour t decided
that receiving him would mean entering a war against Caesar on the losing side. He
was separated from his escor t on the pretext of being taken to the king and assassin
ated (App. BC 2.83±4; Plut. Pomp. 77± 8).
Following Pharsalos, Caesar was in control of the east, and to him came embassies
from its cities and kingdoms. The occasion gave Caesar an oppor tunity to exercise the
clemency in which he took pride. Not only did he make no onerous demands of
money or resources on them, but he lowered their taxes and reduced the role that the
hated tax-farmers played in the collection of taxes (Magie 1950: 405±7). The ancient
privileges of some cities were confirmed; other cities even won new ones. In Perga
mon, for example, `sacred territories' were returned to the gods (IGRR 4.304).
Caesar's goodwill was a great relief to the cities of Asia: they knew from experience
Pompey' s Settlement to the Death of Augustus 93



the harm that a vengeful conqueror could inflict. Unsurprisingly, they showered
Caesar with honours, some of which have sur vived epigraphically. As one would
expect, their praise is high. An inscription from Pergamon, for example, lauds him
as the `saviour and benefactor of all Greeks', while another from Ephesos calls him
a `god made manifest and common saviour of human life' (Raubitschek 1954;
Sherk 79).
Some individuals who had suppor ted Pompey were, however, punished. A large
fine was imposed on Deiotaros, for example, but that is hardly surprising since he had
been one of the last to abandon Pompey. More significant is the fact that he retained
his kingdom. He could hardly expect better. From Asia, Caesar left for Egypt in
pursuit of Pompey, leaving Asia Minor in the care of a trusted suppor ter.
Caesar arrived in Alexandria a few days after Pompey's death and found himself
drawn into the middle of a quarrel between Ptolemy XIII and his elder sister,
Kleopatra VII. Caesar tried to arbitrate, but the small size of his militar y escor t
undermined his ability to dictate terms, and he was forced to hold up in Alexandria
for the winter, with Kleopatra as his mistress, until reinforcements were brought by
Mithradates of Pergamon (an influential suppor ter of Caesar related to several Asia
Minor dynasts) and Hyrkanos, the Jewish high-priest in Jerusalem ([Caes.]Alex.; Jos.
AJ 14.133±9). When he left in mid-47, Kleopatra was ruling jointly with an even
younger brother, Ptolemy XIV, and had borne Caesar a son, Caesarion.
Caesar, having settled the dynastic struggle in Egypt, moved nor thwards, first
through Palestine, where he rewarded the help that Hyrkanos had given him in
Alexandria (Jos. AJ 14.190±212). He was anxious to return to Rome, but first he
had to deal with a serious problem in Asia Minor. Pharnakes, son of Rome's old
nemesis, Mithradates, had used Roman civil strife as an oppor tunity to recover his
father's territories by invading Asia from his kingdom in the Crimea. He had moved
vir tually unopposed into Lesser Armenia and Cappadocia. Caesar's man in Asia
Minor, Domitius Calvinus, scrambled to put together a suitable army, hastened
into Pontos, forced a battle, but was soundly defeated, leaving Pharnakes as master
of Pontos. Caesar now came to the rescue, catching up with his adversar y near Zela.
Two decades earlier Pharnakes' father had defeated one of Lucullus' legates there,
and now the son apparently thought that the coincidence was a favourable omen. His
father's victor y, however, was not repeated. Within a few hours Caesar's legions had
routed him. Caesar's arrival and victor y were so quick that they inspired his famous
boast, veni vedi vici, `I came, I saw, I conquered' ([Caes.] Alex. 69±77; Suet. Iul.
37.2; Plut. Caes. 50.2). His depar ture was as swift as his arrival. Caesar had other
pressing matters, and began his long journey homewards, escor ted and enter tained
along the way by Deiotaros, who was subsequently tried in Rome for plotting against
Caesar en route (Cic. Deiot.; Sullivan 1990: 165±9).
Rome's civil war dragged on for some time in other par ts of the empire. Caesar,
however, was suf ficiently in control in the east that the outlines of a provincial policy
are visible. Earlier in his career he had passed a strict law governing of ficial behaviour
in the provinces, and his interest in the health of the provinces continued. Most
impor tantly for Asia was the transfer of responsibilities of tax-collection from Roman
publicani to the cities' own of ficials. Asia was put in the capable hands of Ser vilius
Isauricus (cos. 48), who took steps to aid the recover y of his province (Magie 1950:
416±17).

3 Triumvirate
A return to stability did not come. In March 44 Caesar was assassinated in Rome, and
the Mediterranean world was plunged again into another period of conflict, this one
longer and more destructive. The Greek east suf fered especially. In 43 BC
the two
leaders of the conspiracy against Caesar, Br utus and Cassius, abandoned Rome and
took up commands in the east. They had neither money, nor troops, and it was clear
that they needed both for their looming str uggle against Caesar's suppor ters. The
money was to come from their new provinces. Taxes that were destined for Italy were
seized, and diver ted to their own purposes (Vell. Pat. 2.62.3; App. BC
4.5). Br utus
demanded of the cities of Asia Minor a sum equivalent to ten years' taxes. Cities that
resisted were attacked. Rhodes, for example, was compelled to surrender all gold and
silver in the city, whether it was public, private, or sacred. In L ykia Br utus made an
example of Xanthos, which was stormed and almost completely destroyed. For the
allied kings the situation was no safer. For hesitating when asked to send aid to
Cassius, Ariobarzanes III, the young king of Cappadocia, was put to death and the
royal treasur y seized (App. BC
4.63; Dio 47.33.1).
Br utus and Cassius amassed their troops in Asia in the summer of 42, and marched
their combined armies into Macedonia to face the Caesarian forces led by Mark
Antony, a protÂ ege Â of Caesar, and Octavian, Caesar's adopted son. Caesar's assassins
were defeated near Phillippi, and this at first brought some relief to Asia. The east
now fell under the control of Antony, and he made some gestures towards a return to
Caesar's policies. A letter of his to Hyrkanos has sur vived in which he remarks that
Asia must be allowed to recover, as if from a great illness (Jos. AJ
14.312). Whether
these intentions were sincere is unclear: he too needed money and land for his
soldiers, and he soon announced in Ephesos that the cities of Asia must provide it
for him (App. BC
5.5.21). The cities were naturally desperate: their money, jeweller y
and silver ware had already been surrendered to Br utus and Cassius. In the end,
Antony's demands were reduced: only nine years' tribute was required to be paid
over the next two years (App. BC
5.6.21±7).
Ptolemaic Egypt would be an impor tant ally, and its queen, Kleopatra, was
summoned to meet Antony in Tarsos. Hearing that he had been greeted as a `new
Dionysos' in Ephesos, Kleopatra decided to take on the role of the `new Aphrodite'
and cruised up the Kydnos River in a gilded barge. The r umour spread that Aphrodite
was revelling with Dionysos for the good of Asia (Plut. Ant
. 26). Clearly she made a
good impression, for she soon became Antony's most impor tant political ally in the
east; he saw to it that her personal enemies, including her sister, were eliminated.
What is more, the relationship soon took a romantic turn. Antony spent the winter in
Egypt, and in the following year she gave bir th to twins.
While Antony was wintering in Egypt, however, several new crises arose. Before the
Battle of Philippi, Cassius had sent Q. Labienus to Par thia to seek suppor t, and he
had become stranded there. Now he joined Pakoros, the son of the Par thian king, in
leading an army across the frontier into Roman Syria. Many of the Roman troops
stationed in Syria had ser ved under Br utus and Cassius and therefore welcomed
Labienus ± thus preventing a repetition of the passive strategy that had been success
ful in the invasions of 51 and 50. From Syria the Par thians swept through Cilicia and
into Asia. To make matters worse, a political crisis in Italy prevented Antony from
Pompey' s Settlement to the Death of Augustus
95



coming to their defence. For now, it had to be abandoned to Labienus and the
Par thians, who met little opposition except in Karia, where several cities resisted and
suf fered terribly. Nine years later, the suf fering of Mylasa could still evoke Roman
sympathy. In 31 B C , Octavian wrote to them of their `over whelmed city, many citizens
made captives, some murdered, some burnt with the city, with the brutality of the
enemy sparing neither shrines nor temples' (SIG
3 768, trans. in Sherk 91). A Roman
counter-attack was inevitable and came the following year, led by Ventidius Bassus, a
subordinate of Antony. He was able to re-establish Roman control ver y quickly: the
Par thian forces were driven out of Asia and Labienus was himself killed.
Once Antony was again in firm control of the east, he had a free hand to organize
its af fairs. His policy depar ted from Pompey's, who assigned territories to dependent
kings only when the existing civic structures were deemed too primitive for Roman
administration. By contrast, Antony preferred client-kings over provinces. This
approach had several advantages. It meant, for example, that his revenues were
more predictable, since dynasts paid fixed tribute rather than taxes that varied with
the economic output of a province. The policy also freed him from the headaches
associated with conducting minor campaigns against the rebellious tribes in places
like Isauria or the Amanos. As Strabo noted, kings were always on the spot and armed
(14.5.5±9). This allowed Antony to concentrate on Par thia and Rome.
Antony's dispositions took shape over the next few years. Competence and loyalty
were rewarded with additional territories, but there were also reversals and reassign
ments. By 36, however, his settlement was largely in place. Deiotaros had died in 39,
and his territories were divided up. By 36, however, most of them had been reunited
under the control of his former minister, Amyntas, who now carried the royal title
(Sullivan 1990: 171± 4). Most of Pontos was now under the rule of Polemon, son of
Zenon, of Laodikeia. As far as we know, he had no royal blood in his veins. Rather, he
and his father had led the resistance of their city against the Par thians during the
invasion. Their loyalty was rewarded first with a small kingdom in Cilicia, and then
with a larger one in Pontos. Cappadocia came into the hands of Archelaos, grandson
of a general of Mithradates. He had been hereditar y ruler-priest of Pontic Komana, a
small principality in eastern Pontos (Sullivan 1990: 183±5). Antony's policy was a
sensible one, and the quality of the monarchs whom Antony appointed is evidenced
by the fact that most sur vived the defeat of Antony at Actium, and thrived under
Augustus.
Antony's most impor tant ally was Kleopatra, and her possessions were also
expanded to include Cyprus, eastern Cilicia, Crete and Cyrene (Jos. AJ 14.392±7,
406; BJ 1.288±92, 297; Dio 49.32.5). She celebrated the donation by establishing a
new regnal era. Henceforth, the years of her reign were counted from this date (Sherk
88; Sullivan 1990: 270±2). These distributions were consistent with Antony's policy
of strengthening the dependent kings in the region. But the alliance was personal
also. Sometime in the winter of 37/36, Antony acknowledged that the twins born to
Kleopatra three years earlier were his own. Some form of marriage occurred at this
point, which alienated many Romans, especially since Antony had not yet divorced his
Roman wife, Octavia, sister of Octavian (Plut. Demetr. Ant. Compar. 41; Livy Per.
131). Antony, it was charged (with some justification) was becoming less a Roman
magistrate, and more a Hellenistic monarch. But there were also some practical
96 Claude Eilers



strategic advantages. Formalizing his alliance with Kleopatra enhanced his status in
the east and signalled his intention to stay in the east for the long term.
This policy of downloading problematic regions to client-kings allowed Antony to
pursue his own ambitions, which included mounting an expedition against Par thia in
the summer of 36. His immediate aim was to invade Media from Armenia and capture
its chief city. This would avoid repeating Crassus' mistake of attacking Par thia
through territor y that was tactically disadvantageous. Despite the strategic superiority
of Antony's plan, his invasion failed miserably. In order to hasten his arrival in Media,
Antony advanced ahead of his siege equipment, which was insuf ficiently defended.
The Par thians attacked the column and destroyed it, rendering his objective unattain
able and inspiring the king of Armenia to switch his alliance to Par thia at the worst
possible moment. After some hesitation, Antony was forced to retreat, but through
territor y that was now hostile. The march homewards was gruelling, and by the time
the legions were safe in Roman territor y, Antony had lost a third of his forces (Plut.
Ant. 34±50). The setback was significant, both to his militar y resources and to his
reputation as a general. He tried to undo some of the damage by under taking a new
campaign, this time against the king of Armenia for his treacher y. He successfully
occupied Armenia in 34 B C , and led its king in a grand procession in Alexandria
(Magie 1950: 427± 40; Debevoise 1938: 123±38). This, however, gave his Roman
rivals an oppor tunity to attack him. The procession was suf ficiently like a Roman tri
umph that he could be charged with yet another anti-Roman act ± transferring a
sacred Roman ritual away from Rome.
Antony's campaigns against Par thia were expensive, both in terms of manpower
and money, and they now revealed the dangerous degree to which he had come to
depend on Kleopatra. Naturally, this suppor t came at a price, and Antony announced
fur ther grants to Kleopatra and her children, including giving them sovereignty over
Armenia, Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia. Antony even minted coins that had his por trait
on one side and Kleopatra's on the other (Sullivan 1990: 273±5).
The rivalr y between Octavian and Antony had always been strong, and their
relations had deteriorated seriously over the preceding years. This would now resolve
itself through arms, and both sides began to mobilize for the coming struggle.
Serious divisions arose, however, among Antony's Roman suppor ters, mostly over
Kleopatra. Domitius Ahenobarbus, perhaps the most illustrious of Antony's suppor t
ers and the consul of 32, was publicly rude to her (Vell. Pat. 2.84). Others urged
Antony to send her back to Alexandria (Plut. Ant. 56.2). Some suppor ters even
defected to Octavian. The critical moment came when Octavian illegally seized and
made public the contents of Antony's will, which revealed that he wanted to be
buried in Alexandria. In the light of Antony's earlier behaviour towards Kleopatra,
this was easily presented as treason. Roman public opinion now clearly swung behind
Octavian, and more suppor ters abandoned Antony.
War was inevitable. Antony was forced to mobilize the east's resources, already
seriously depleted by earlier strife. No proper ty was safe. One of his subordinates even
cut down the sacred grove of Asklepios in Kos to provide timber to build warships
(Dio 51.8.3; Val. Max. 1.1.9). The east again was forced to supply labour, animals
and troops. Plutarch repor ts that the citizens of Chaironeia, including his great
grandfather, were compelled to carr y grain down to the sea under the whips of
Pompey' s Settlement to the Death of Augustus 97



Antony's agents. They were in the process of bringing a new load when news came of
Antony's defeat at Actium on 2 September 31 BC
(Plut. Ant. 68.4).
Antony's defeat clearly signalled his end, though he escaped with Kleopatra to
Alexandria, where they tried to organize fur ther resistance. Their attempts, however,
were futile, as Antony's suppor ters, seeing that victor y was impossible, defected to
Octavian in a steady stream. Alexandria fell in the summer of 31. Antony died,
probably by his own hand; Kleopatra was captured and lived another nine days before
taking her own life.
4 The Augustan Principate
Octavian's triumph at Actium settled the question of who would dominate the
Mediterranean world, and freed the east from the disastrous strife that had beset it
for so long. W ith peace came prosperity and the long, slow process by which the
Greek east was finally reconciled to Roman r ule in a unified empire.
It was not an easy task. Much of the Greek world was in a sorr y state. In mainland
Greece, Strabo, who wrote later in Augustus' reign, repor ts that the countr yside
became depopulated and the local economies impoverished (8.7.5±8.3; 9.2.16±18).
This description is probably exaggerated (Alcock 1993), but economic pressures
existed nonetheless. Many par ts of the Greek east had never fully recovered from
the Mithradatic wars and had suf fered many hardships in Rome's civil strife. An
anecdote from Josephos (AJ 16.18f f.) illustrates the problem. In 14
BC
Herod
came to Asia Minor to meet Agrippa. In Chios he discovered that the city's stoa,
which had been destroyed during the Mithradatic occupation almost seventy years
earlier, was still in r uins. Out of generosity he paid for its renovation. The situation in
Delos was similar. It had been sacked by one of Mithradates' generals during the
Mithradatic war and again by pirates in 69. Some par ts of the city were abandoned,
and Delos never fully recovered (cf. Anth. Pal. 9.408, 421). These cases may not have
been typical. But they well illustrate that what the Greek east most needed was a
period of peace and reconstr uction.
Following the battle of Actium, Octavian remained in the region and was able to
assess the state of much of the Greek east and address some of its problems. The
wealth of Egypt put him in a position to be generous. He distributed grain to some
cities and remitted the debts of others (Dio Chr ys. 31.66; Plut. Ant. 68). He made
some significant changes. Egypt was tur ned into a province gover ned by equestrian
gover nors, a major innovation. Cypr us and Crete again became provinces. In 27 BC
Augustus (as now he was named) revamped Rome's provincial system. The older,
wealthier and more peaceful provinces became `public' provinces, gover ned by pro
consuls selected by seniority and the lot. Other, `imperial', provinces were governed
by legates appointed by Augustus. The east saw both kinds of province. Syria, with its
legions and the potentially problematic Par thian frontier, was under a legate, while
most provinces ± Asia, Achaea, Macedonia ± had proconsuls, at least to begin with
(Dio 53.13±15).
As had been the case under Antony, large areas remained under the control of allied
kings. Archelaos of Cappadocia, Amyntas of Galatia, Polemon of Pontos and Herod
of Judaea all owed their positions to Antony, and had remained loyal to him until his
defeat was inevitable. They managed, however, to transfer their loyalty to Octavian
98 Claude Eilers



and not only saved their kingdoms, but in time became the bulwarks of Augustus'
eastern network, imposing peace on warlike local tribes and providing a buf fer
between Rome and Par thia.
Galatia was especially impor tant in the system, given that it included the main land
route from Asia to Syria. In 25 B C , its king, Amyntas, was killed while attempting to
pacify the Homanadenses, one of several bellicose tribes of the Tauros. The area was
too impor tant to leave in the inexperienced hands of Amyntas' son, Pylaimenes, and
so Augustus annexed Galatia and governed it through legates (Dio 53.26; Mitchell
1993: 73±6). The pacification of these tribes took several decades more of concen
trated ef for t, including the foundation of veteran colonies, the building of a militar y
road, and several major campaigns (Dio 55.28; Levick 1967: 24± 41). The changes
that accompanied provincialization were significant. Before Roman rule, central Asia
Minor was not highly urbanized. There were, of course, trading-centres, for ts and
villages, but these were nothing like the typical Greek city in status or structure. Now
the region benefited from a conscious policy of urbanization, with the foundation of
cities that to this day remain impor tant, such as Ankyra, modern Ankara (Mitchell
1993: 87±91; Levick 1967: 193± 4).
The annexation of Galatia demonstrated that the major provincial realignment of
27 would not be the final word, and other changes are attested (cf. Dio 54.4.1).
Augustus' burden was significant, especially the duty to oversee almost all the trouble
spots on Rome's frontier. Some of the responsibilities were passed to Agrippa, his
closest political ally and soon to be his son-in law. In 23 Agrippa was sent to the east
with sweeping authority to oversee this par t of the empire. Little is known of his
actions in the region, but when he returned in 21 B C , Augustus himself journeyed
east for two years, only to be replaced again by Agrippa.
These moves were intended at least in par t to keep pressure on Rome's Par thian
rival. Their victories over Crassus and Antony, and their invasion of Syria and Asia,
were still fresh in people's minds. The situation was also unstable in Armenia, which
after Antony's depar ture on the eve of Actium had fallen into the hands of pro
Par thian elements. Augustus' strategy was to keep Par thia of f-balance by keeping the
threat of militar y action alive and encouraging a rival to the Par thian throne, who was
living in exile in Syria (Dio 51.18.2±3). In the mid-20s Tiridates somehow managed
to kidnap the young son of Phraates IV of Par thia, and took him to Rome. At
about the same time, pro-Roman elements in Armenia rose up and demanded a
new ruler, Tigranes III, who was also living in exile in Roman territories. Augustus
returned the young Par thian prince to his father, which proved to be the gesture
needed to make a diplomatic breakthrough possible (Dio 53.33.2; Debevoise 1938:
136±7). The standards and prisoners captured from Crassus and Antony were
returned, and no objection was made when Augustus sent the young Tiberius, son
of his wife Livia, to install the pro-Roman Tigranes III on the Armenian throne (Dio
54.8.1; RG 29; A. Sher win-White 1984: 323± 41). The success was celebrated in
Rome and the empire as a bloodless victor y and became a central theme of Augustan
propaganda (RG 29).
Agrippa spent a second period super vising the east from 18±13 B C , but now
concern about the region was fading as the Par thian threat continued to diminish.
Thus, no one was sent to replace him as overseer of the eastern provinces. Indeed, by
10 B C , relations were suf ficiently restored that Phraates IV sent his four sons to live in
Pompey' s Settlement to the Death of Augustus 99



Rome. This was done in order to prevent them being used by his enemies as
challengers to his own position (Strabo 16.1.28; RG 32.2; Braund 1984: 12±13).
In 6 BC
, however, events required the creation of a new eastern command. Tigranes
III of Armenia had recently died. Rome had a preferred replacement, but Tigranes'
son (Tigranes IV) successfully opposed him and turned to Par thia for suppor t (Dio
55.9.4; Tac. Ann. 2.4). Tiberius, who was now Augustus' son-in-law, was given
sweeping authority as a preparation for an eastern command. Internal politics in
Rome inter vened, however, and Tiberius (for reasons that have been debated ever
since), retired from public life to Rhodes, where he would remain for almost a decade
(Levick 1976: 31± 49). For now, the Armenian problem was left to fester.
The situation in the east soon became even more unsettled. First, in 4 BC
, Herod
died. He had been an impor tant figure in the near east for a generation. Although he
was originally an appointee of Antony, he became a tr usted par t of Augustus' eastern
network of allied kingdoms. The histor y of his reign, however, was marked by civil
unrest and dynastic turmoil that led to the trial and execution of several of the sons
groomed to succeed him. When he died in 4 BC
, his will instr ucted that his kingdom
be divided among three sur viving sons, none of whom were well suited to r ule.
Augustus upheld Herod's wishes and awarded the lion's share of the kingdom to
Herod's son Archelaos. While the Herodian princes were in Rome arguing their cases,
however, rebellion broke out at home, and Rome's Syrian legions had to inter vene
(Jos. BJ 1.211±2.166; AJ 14±17; Schu È rer 1973: 287±329).
The instability in the region was even fur ther exacerbated when Phraates IV of
Par thia was murdered in 3/2 BC
by his wife and son, who then took the throne as
Phraates V (or Phraatakes). He took a strongly anti-Roman line, especially in Armenia,
where he suppor ted the anti-Roman Tigranes IV. Tiberius' retirement had prevented
a timely inter vention in Armenia. It now provided an oppor tunity, however, for
Augustus' grandson Gaius to acquire militar y experience, to gain exposure in the
provinces, and to be showcased as a future princeps. Gaius' send-of f and progress
eastwards were as much about show as reality. Grand ceremonies in Rome marked his
depar ture and Rome's poets celebrated his coming success. So, too, did the cities of
the Greek east. In Athens, for example, he was celebrated as the `New Ares' ( IG 2
2
3.3250, trans. Braund 1985: no. 55), and a Greek poet prophesied an easy victor y:
`Go for th to the Euphrates, son of Zeus, for already the Par thians are deser ting to you
on eastern feet' (Anth. Pal. 9.297).
In 1 BC
Gaius set out for the east, accompanied by Augustus' most tr usted friends.
For now, there was no need to hurr y. In AD
1 he led an expedition in Nabataean
Arabia against nomadic raiders (Romer 1979; Bowersock 1983: 56). He then made
his way to the Par thian frontier, where he met in conference with the young Par thian
king, Phraatakes (Vell. Pat. 2.101). A new understanding was reached, and Gaius
then advanced into Armenia, with Par thian acquiescence, to install the Roman
candidate on the Armenian throne. Anti-Roman elements were less accommodating,
however, and revolted, throwing the countr y into turmoil and compelling Gaius to
inter vene with the legions accompanying him. During the siege of a rebel stronghold,
however, Gaius was wounded; eighteen months later, he died (A. Sher win-White
1984: 325±7).
The dynastic turmoil of the preceding decade was now more or less resolved in
favour of Tiberius. He was now adopted by Augustus, ef fectively designating him as
100 Claude Eilers



successor. This turmoil, however, had not been confined to the imperial house, or to
Rome. Cities and kings in the east had a strong interest in the succession, and
jockeyed for position among the possible successors. Some tried to abandon their
connections with Tiberius while Gaius prevailed, including Tiberius' old friend
Archelaos, king of Cappadocia, whom he defended in a trial in Rome in the 20s
(Levick 1971). He tried to demonstrate his loyalty to Gaius by publicly insulting
Tiberius, thereby earning Tiberius' lifelong enmity and causing his eventual downfall
(Dio 57.17.3±5). Others in the east seem also to have been drawn into the struggle
(Bowersock 1984).
The competition to honour the emperor and his family is one of the most striking
developments of this period. Indeed, in at least one case the competition was formal.
In 9 B C the provincial assembly of Asia announced the winner in a long-standing
contest to find the most appropriate honour for Augustus `whom, for the benefit of
mankind, providence has filled with excellence, as if it had sent him as a saviour for us
and our descendants' (OGIS 458, trans. in Sherk 101). The prize was a gold crown,
and it was won by Paulus Fabius Maximus, the governor, who proposed that the
province should adopt a new calendar that began the year on Augustus' bir thday (23
Sept.), with the first month named `Caesar' in his honour.
The most extreme example of such honours is, of course, the introduction of the
public cult of the emperor in the east. Ruler cult had long been practised in the Greek
east, first for Hellenistic kings, and later (on occasion) for Roman of ficials in the
Republic (Chaniotis, this volume). Almost immediately after Antony's defeat, repre
sentatives from two cities asked permission to establish a cult for the new ruler.
Octavian proceeded cautiously, not wanting to of fend the sensibilities of the
Roman elite and thus repeat the mistake of his adoptive father. Non-Romans were
allowed to worship him in two cities in conjunction with the cult of the goddess
Roma, which had a long histor y in Asia Minor, while Romans worshipped Roma and
the deified Julius in Ephesos and Nikaia (Dio 51.20.6±7; Mellor 1975).
From these modest beginnings, the phenomenon of ruler worship exploded. It
spread throughout the cities of the Greek east, and by the end of Augustus' reign
most cities of any impor tance had introduced some aspect of the imperial cult
alongside their traditional religious obser vances. Temples and altars were built, rituals
introduced, priesthoods and festivals established. Even minor figures within the
imperial house were sometimes included. The development and spread of the imper
ial cult, however, should not be interpreted merely as extreme obsequiousness. The
new cults succeeded because they did not replace traditional systems, but supple
mented them, and provided a context in which Roman power could be contextual
ized for a Greek constituency (S. Price 1984).
The new system also resulted in new oppor tunities for civic elites. Maintenance of
the cult of Rome and Augustus fell to the provincial assembly, where the elites of
provincial cities found a new venue for their ambition. Such competition, however,
acted to align their interests with Rome and the emperor (Magie 1950: 447±52). The
imperial cult also illustrates the degree to which the emperor dominated the provin
cial conception of the empire and their place in it. The corollar y of this was the
gradual disappearance under Augustus of senatorial patrons of cities (Eilers 2002;
Nicols 1990). When provincials looked to the centre of the Roman world, they saw
the Emperor there (Millar 1984a). The last decade of Augustus' life was a time of
Pompey' s Settlement to the Death of Augustus 101



personal disappointment for him, and setbacks for the Empire. The death of Gaius in
Syria in A D 4 destroyed his plans for the succession. But there were growing problems
elsewhere. Decisive action became necessar y in Judaea, where Archelaos proved to be
unsuitable for rule and an obstacle to stability in the region. InA D 6, he was removed,
apparently for his heavy-handedness in dealing with dissent, and Judaea became a
Roman province (Jos. BJ 2.111; Dio 55.27.6). The process included a census, which
implied the coming imposition of Roman taxation, an event that found its way
(erroneously) into the stor y of Christ's bir th (Luke 2:1±3 with Millar 1993: 46).
The census was accompanied by resistance and unrest, and the new province, super
vised by equestrian of ficials, proved dif ficult to govern.
The problems in the east soon faded into the background, as a major rebellion in
Pannonia in A D 6 required a transfer of resources and manpower towards the empire's
nor thern frontier. This was done par tly by resor ting to the unusual expedient of
appointing governors for the public provinces for two years instead of one (Dio
55.28.2), and par tly by transferring the only legionar y contingents in Asia Minor to
the nor thern front (Vell. Pat. 2.112.4, with Mitchell 1976). No sooner had this
rebellion been finally settled in A D 9 than a new rebellion broke out in Germany.
Unsurprisingly, the east receded from view. Indeed, in the coming centur y, no
emperor would visit Asia.

No single ancient source gives us an account of the experience of the whole of the east
for the whole of our period. There are periods during the civil wars where the
east takes centre stage, and so become approachable through Appian's Civil Wars,
Dio's Histor y, or Plutarch's Life of Antony (which is best read with Pelling 1987 and
1996). Normally, however, one must piece together scattered literar y and documen
tar y sources. Much of the leg-work has been done by others. Magie 1950 provides a
comprehensive, though now somewhat dated, treatment of Roman Asia Minor. A. N.
Sher win-White (1984) describes the political manoeuvring over the Ancient Near
East up to the death of Gaius. For the evolution of central Anatolia, see especially
Mitchell 1993, which begins with our period and goes far beyond it. The details
concerning the dependent kings of the period are handily collected by Sullivan 1990,
but only up to the battle of Actium; for a somewhat wider perspective, see Braund
1984. For the impact of the new Augustan principate on the provinces generally, see
Millar 1984a; and on the imperial cult, S. Price 1984. Important documents in the
original languages can be found in SIG 3 , OGIS, RDGE, and the most impor tant
documents per taining to Augustus are conveniently collected by Ehrenberg and
Jones 1976; translations of many of these documents are available in Sherk 1984
and Braund 1985.

CHAPTER SEVEN
The Ptolemies and Egypt
Dorothy J. Thompson
1 Setting the Scene
When Alexander died in 323 B C , Ptolemy son of Lagos, Macedonian general and
historian of Alexander's conquests, made straight for Egypt, a countr y he first met
together with the Conqueror. Here, with a keen eye on the geography and natural
wealth of the region, he inaugurated the most long-lasting of the Hellenistic dynas
ties.
On his invasion in 332 Alexander had gained swift recognition as ruler in succes
sion to the unpopular Persians. His foundation of Alexandria on the coast, with its
rich agricultural hinterland and double harbour, formed a new Mediterranean focus
for the countr y. Here he built a temple to the goddess Isis, and at Memphis he
sacrificed to Egyptian Apis and the other gods. These acts combined with his visit to
the oracle of Ammon, out in the western deser t at Siwa, to provide a clear policy
statement for his successors (Arr. Anab. 3.1±5). Control of the wealth and power of
Egypt depended on a rule attuned to the existing sensibilities of a people whose
religion and culture were deeply established.
A local Greek, Kleomenes of Naukratis, was left in control by Alexander. Suppor ted
by militar y garrisons and local administrators, Kleomenes proved successful in rev
enue-raising. How far, on liquidating the man himself, Ptolemy adopted Kleomenes'
system remains speculative; he was cer tainly more conciliator y towards the priests
than was the latter. Strengthened no doubt by the successful hijack of the embalmed
remains of the Conqueror (Erskine 2002a), at first Ptolemy governed the region on
behalf of Alexander's heirs. In 304, however, he followed Antigonos and took the
Greek title of king, so regularizing his position as the new monarch of Egypt (see now
P. Ko Èln VI 247.ii.28±38; Braund, this volume).
The countr y he ruled consisted of some 23,000 square kilometres of fer tile land
which extended some 320 kilometres along the narrow valley of the Nile from the first
cataract in the south to the Delta and the Mediterranean coast. The broad-stretching,
well-watered Delta to the nor th was dif ficult to cross; the entr y to Egypt from the east
ran south from Pelousion to Memphis. From Heliopolis at the Delta's apex, the



Kanopic branch of the Nile ran nor th to Alexandria from where the coastal route ran
west to Cyrene, a key Ptolemaic possession. From Memphis, there was access overland
to the rich lake province of the Fayum. To the south lay Thebes with its great temples at
Karnak and Luxor, another historic centre of the countr y. Ptolemy's foundation of a
fur ther full Greek city in the south, Ptolemais Hermeiou, marks a deliberate attempt to
spread Ptolemaic control along the full valley of the Nile. By the 290s there were
Greeks well-established in Thebes which, despite Ptolemais, remained the key centre of
Upper Egypt (Clar ysse 1995: 1; Depauw 2000: 32).
Bounded on either side by deser t ± Libya to the west and Arabia to the east ± the
thin strip of the Nile valley was linked to the Red Sea by caravan routes from Dendera,

the nor th across the Delta, a canal along the Wadi Tumilat joined the river to the head
of the Red Sea. From various points along the valley south from Oxyrhynchos caravan
trails ran west to the oases. A postal ser vice, most probably a Persian inheritance,
provided speedy communication along the valley (
Sel.Pap
. II 397 [
c
. 255 BC
]) and
new foundations on the Red Sea coast formed staging posts for the transpor ts
bringing African elephants for the Ptolemaic army, together with ivor y and Nubian
gold for the royal treasur y (Strabo 17.1.45; Burstein 1996b). Egypt was a rich
countr y and the annual flood of the Nile allowed extensive irrigation agriculture
(Bowman and Rogan 1999).
The agricultural wealth of Egypt allowed Ptolemy to develop the countr y's
finances, and the natural frontiers for defence aided his consolidation of an ef fective
and lasting power-base. When his competitor Perdikkas attacked in 321, Ptolemy's
forces combined with the crocodiles of the Nile to defeat the invader (Diod. 17.33±
6); it was not until the mid second centur y that a rival dynast, the Seleukid king
Antiochos IV of Syria, succeeded in (briefly) conquering Egypt.
With a strong base at home and an Aegean empire, Ptolemy made use of family and
friends in his management of his kingdom and its dependencies. His stepson Magas
was installed in Cyrene in 301; that city was to prove a fer tile source of both troops
and scholars for the Ptolemies. His brother Menelaos governed Cypr us from 310
until 306, when it fell to the Antigonids. In setting up a monarchic system in which
cities had little par t to play, Ptolemy made use both of the newcomers and existing
administrative classes. As Diodoros repor ts in what is a reliable account for these early
years, `he treated the natives with kindness' (18.14.1). Native temples were recog
nized with donations of land recorded in hieroglyphics, the sacred script of Egypt
(D. J. Thompson 1994b: 72). A royal loan of 50 talents helped meet mummification
costs for an Apis bull, and the Memphite cult of the deified (mummified) bull as
Osorapis lay behind the development of the new Greek cult of Sarapis. Among his
native advisors Manetho of Sebennytos, high priest of Heliopolis and historian, seems
likely to have played a key role.
Egyptian religion had never been exclusive; presenting themselves to immigrant
and local populations in dif ferent forms, the gods of Egypt had a long and power ful
life. Hor us the Behedite of Edfu was Apollo for the Greeks, Ra became Helios, Amun
of Thebes was Zeus, and so on. For the Greek immigrants, however, it was their
human guise which was preferred to Egyptian animal forms. In promoting the cause
of native gods, their festivals and cults and in temple-building, Ptolemy I and his
successors found a sure way to establish their rule.
An impor tant feature of the Ptolemaic administration set up by Ptolemy I was that
it was a literate system, one that was administered by scribes at all levels in writing.
It is only in the reign of Ptolemy II that a change in burial practice occurred with
impor tant consequences for our knowledge of this system. The introduction of
mummy casing formed from waste papyri known as `car tonnage', a form of papier
m Ã ach Â e, has provided information unparalleled in the ancient world. Given the dr y
climate of Egypt, papyri used for car tonnage preser ve intact not only literar y texts but
also the papers, both public and private, of those involved in the administration of the
countr y. Once discarded, these recycled texts now give insights to the modern
historian that are all the more precious given the absence of more regular historical
accounts and the dif ferent sor ts of issues that they treat.

Such histories as do sur vive ± that of Polybios, in fragments only, of Diodoros, of
impor tance mainly for the early period, or the lurid and headline-grabbing stories
of Pompeius Trogus, excerpted by Justin ± may for Egypt be filled out not only
by inscriptions but, more par ticularly, by the evidence of papyri. Regularly devoid
of a wider context and sur viving often in fragments, such texts create their own
problems but also of fer great possibilities. The view of Ptolemaic Egypt they allow
is a patchwork one, a kaleidoscopic picture in which the hand of the historian needs
a firm control. To write histor y from papyri is a formidable challenge (Bagnall
1995).
2 The Ptolemaic System
Under a dynastic rule, political stability depends on a trouble-free form of succession.
The Ptolemaic dynasty was a family one which in normal times provided a clear and
easy change of rule between the generations. Sometimes, however, and especially in
the second and first centuries, sibling rivalr y in an extreme form, aggravated by the
rivalr y of related queens, threatened central control; this was the case with the two
sons of both Kleopatra I and III. With brother±sister marriage added to Macedonian
royal polygamy (from the reign of Ptolemy II), the family relationships of the
Ptolemies at times are barely credible (Whitehorne 1993; Ogden 1999: 67±116).
But in the third centur y at first the succession ran smoothly. Ptolemy II ruled
together with his father before taking over completely. His reign ran from 285 and
he continued his father's work in shaping the new system. Indeed, given the sur vival
of cartonnage, it is from his reign that details emerge of many institutions which may
well have preceded his reign. In his policies, as already for his father, the interrelated
issues of defence, revenue-raising and wider administrative control take their place
beside cultural issues af fecting the mixed and varied population of his kingdom,
which are highlighted in this early period.
The supply of soldiers was a problem for all Hellenistic monarchs. The success of
Ptolemy I's innovator y policy of settling soldiers on the land was proved in 306, when
Ptolemaic soldiers, defeated on Cyprus by Demetrios, preferred to deser t back home
to Egypt rather than accept good pay from the victor (Diod. 20.47.4). Cavalr ymen
were endowed with plots of 100 or 80 arouras (27.5 or 22 hectares), infantr ymen
with smaller plots. For others, billets were provided in the homes of Egyptians,
accompanied often by tension and trouble, as in this memorandum (Sel.Pap.II 413
[241 B C ]):
We find that several of the houses in Krokodeilon polis which were earlier used for
housing troops have had their roofs demolished by their owners; likewise, altars have
been built against their doors to prevent their use as billets . . .
Settlement was concentrated in the Fayum, where the combination of exper tise of
Macedonian drainage and Egyptian irrigation engineers resulted in widespread rec
lamation and a new garden province for Egypt (D. J. Thompson 1999a). The royal
input to this development project is marked in the names of the area. Egypt was
traditionally divided into nomes and the Fayum, earlier known as the Marsh, under
Ptolemy II was renamed the Arsinoite nome after his sister and wife. More than one
108 Dorothy J. Thompson



villag e in the region was called Arsinoe; Philade lphia was n amed fo r her, and under
Ptolemy III Eue rgetes (the Benefact or) the nom e capital Krokodeilon polis became
Ptolema is Euer getis. Here, as else where, new royal names we re marked upo n the
landscap e of Egypt; the new settlers general ly flour ished. It is also from this excep
tional area that much of the Ptolema ic car tonn age derives, pres enting a somewh at
biased picture.
Popul ation registers from the period sh ow that settler famil ies wer e larger, more
compl ex an d cer tainly bette r endow ed than those of Egypt ian peasan ts who were
their neighbo urs (D. J. Thom pson 2002). In the second centur y the system of
allotm ents (
kle
Ã
roi ) was extende d to the Egypt ian infantr ymen recr uited for the
Four th Syri an war . Land gran ts became smaller as time we nt on with the developm ent
of othe r for ms of recr uiting and reta ining the loyalty of the ar my . From the reign of
Ptolemy VI, the intro duction of
polite umata provide d a new sour ce of identit y for
dif ferent (ofte n ar my) co mmunitie s; star ting in the same reig n and cont inuing under
his brother, a series of new urban foundat ions with dynastic names (Ph ilometor is,
Kleop atra, Eue rgetis) ser ved as gar rison poi nts especially in the south (Kramer 1997;
Hein en 199 7). As in other pol icy areas, over time approac hes to the prob lem might
dif fer; the basic concer n with defen ce rem ained.
The wealt h of the crown dep ended to a large degree on the su ccess of agri cultural
prod uction. As new areas, like the Fayum, we re brought under cult ivation, so new
crop s we re intro duced. Naked
durum whe at proved popul ar and eve ntually sup
planted the tradi tional husked emmer-wheat; bread took ove r from por ridg e as a
standa rd fo od. Some exp eriments, like the cabbage from Rhodes that tur ned bitte r
(Athen. 9.369f .), we re not altogeth er su ccessful but, as with new breed s of animals
(shee p from Eubo ia, pigs from Sici ly), the intro duction of vines, olives, and other
cash crop s will have had a significant impac t on the agricult ural scene of Egypt (D. J.
Thom pson 1999b). T hey also prov ed an impor tant source of reve nue and, whi lst
rents and taxes on cereal crops wer e charged and lev ied in kind, those on orchards and
vines came in cash . For an impor tant new featur e o f the Ptole maic system was that it
was no w monet arized, with taxes colle cted in cas h as we ll as in k ind.
In the Fayum, most land was nom inally `royal land', belongi ng to the king. Som e
land was cede d to cler uchs and temple s (`cler uchic' and `sac red land'); on this only
smal ler taxes we re charged. On most of the land, howeve r, the crown levied rent s and
taxes, which regularly amou nted to ove r half annual prod uction. In the southe r n Nile
valley , in cont rast, a similar level of charg e in the for m of a h ar vest tax (V andorpe
2000b) was made on the cultivated ar ea of what was there labelled `priv ate land' .
Such land cou ld be bought or sold; it often belon ged to temple s but was subjec t still
to royal taxation. This prerogati ve o f levying ch arges on all the land of Egypt and the
high level of thes e illustra te we ll the over riding powe r of the monarch y . The res ulting
revenue enabl ed Egypt to become engaged in Aeg ean-wide politics ± she even ran a
gar ris on in Attica dur ing the C hremonide an war (268±266 ) ± and to wage a series of
wars aga inst her closest rivals, the Sel eukids, with whom she str uggled for contro l of
Palest ine and the Gaza strip , in anti quity known as Hollo w Syri a (Koil e Syri a).
Behind the lev y of land rents lay the operat ion of the land sur vey . From 258,
a demotic ostrako n found in the Kar nak temple at Thebe s records an ord er made
when the phar aoh (Ptolem y II) was away at Daphne , invol ved in the Second Syrian
war:
The Ptolem ies and Egypt 109



A sur vey of Egypt was ordered, specifying field by field their ir rigation possibilities, their
location, their quality , their arable por tions, their relation to the proper ty of the pro

the royal fields, specifying area by area the size of the parcels and vineyards, noting when
the fields of the area are dr y ± likewise the pastures ± and the water channels, the fields
that are free and vacant, the high fields, and the fields that are (ar tificially) ir rigated, their

footpaths, the list of leased parcels with their equipment, the decisions concer ning the

dependents of the reigning king, and, in addition, their taxes, the total of the expend
itures for the welfare of Egypt and its sublime freedom, of its cities and of its temples.

involve d come clearly throug h the texts (V erhoogt 1998).
Land revenues, howe ver, did not suf fice to me et the needs of the state, and under
the Ptolemies, per haps for the first time in Egypt , a poll- tax was introduced in the
for m of the salt-tax. Earlier, recor ds of the countr y's popul ation were compiled to
register the manpow er availab le for cor v Â e e labour, both for special tasks and for
regular annual work on the ir rigation ditches an d dikes. Known mainly from the
third centur y , the salt-ta x was a low level tax that was char ged o n me n and women
alike; women paid a lower rate and over the course o f the third cent ur y the general
rate was lowered more than once (Clar ysse and Thompson 1995). The salt-tax
was charged and colle cted in cash; such a per vasiv e charge played a significant
par t in progressive monetization . The register s of taxpaye rs, organiz ed on a house
hold basis as als o by tax- categor y and occupation, prov ide det ails of househo ld
composition and str ucture (Bagnal l and Frier 19 94; D. J. Thompson 1997 and
2002). Tax-collection was a complex bus iness, an interesting mix of public and
private which is typical of much of the Ptolemaic sys tem. Taxes we re far me d out
to the highest bidde r, with solid guarante es require d befor e any contract was
issued. It was state collec tors, howeve r, who played a major role in collec tion
on the ground. Greek fi nancial str u ctures were thus added to the existing system
of stat e control (von Reden 200 1). The same amalgam of interests may be found
in othe r aspects of the system. The state gav e ± in grants, for instanc e, made to
temples ± and it co llected; others were financially responsible for any poten tial
shor tfall.
State involveme nt was pe r vasiv e in most economic aspects of Egypt . In agricult ure,
a crop sc hedule detaile d the crop s that wer e to be sown ( P .Y ale 36.2±3 [232 BC
];
P .T ebt. III 703.57±60 [ c. 242 BC
], translated Austin 253 and 25 6). The cultivation
and ex ploitation of oil crops were centrally controlled at ever y stage (BD 1 14 [259
BC
]; Binge n 1978a); textile producti on was closely watched, and some other for ms of
producti on were subjected to monopo ly control (Pr Â e aux 193 9: 93±11 6; Bingen
110 Dorothy J. Th ompson



1978a). All was carefully watched by an army of officials, who in turn were carefully
controlled (P.Tebt. III 703, trans as Burstein 101, extracts):
During your tours of inspection, tr y to encourage each individual . . . . The sowing of the
nome in accordance with the plan for planting is to be one of your prime concerns . . . . It
is your responsibility that the designated provisions are transpor ted to Alexandria. . . . Go
also to the weaving sheds . . . and take special care that the looms are in operation. . . .
Conduct an audit also of the revenues, village by village . . . . Make a list of the royal
houses and of the gardens associated with them. . . . Take particular care that no fraud
occur or any other wrongful act . . . . (Thus) you will create security in the countr yside
and increase the revenues significantly . . . . You should behave well and be upright in your
duties, not getting involved with bad company, avoid any involvement in corruption,
believe that if you are not accused of such things, you will merit promotion, keep this
memorandum to hand and write concerning each matter as required.
These short extracts from a long exhor tator y memorandum spell out the royal
ideology; as is clear from a mound of complaints, the practice was often dif ferent.
The fact that all was written down enables us to trace some of the conflicting
pressures involved at dif ferent levels of such a bureaucratic system (D. J. Crawford
1978).
Where did the Ptolemies find the men to run their administration and how did they
keep them loyal? Figures are always uncer tain but new data from the Fayum suggest
that immigrants represented a small percentage of the population, perhaps 10±15 per
cent overall, unevenly distributed with a heavy concentration in Alexandria and
Lower Egypt (P.Count 1 [254±231 B C ]; D. J. Thompson 2001: 312). The use,
therefore, of existing personnel was essential, and the hieroglyphic evidence of
Egyptian sarcophagi and statues allows us to trace some of those involved (D. J.
Thompson 1992: 44±5). So do the papyri themselves since in the early generations
demotic was still used alongside Greek, and Greek itself is on occasion written with
the Egyptian rush (not the Greek pen) allowing us to identify Egyptian scribes at
work (Tait 1988). Language too is a give-away; Egyptian scribes did not always write
good Greek (Clar ysse 1993). Such an open, non-exclusive approach on the par t of
the new rulers to those already in post may have been inevitable. Never theless, this
was typical of the Ptolemaic approach to rule. Native law-codes and courts were also
left in place; such an approach was no doubt impor tant in winning suppor t.
In some ways, however, an active policy of hellenization can be char ted. In
Alexandria, the Librar y and the Museum (Erskine 1995) formed the physical em
bodiment of a royal policy of patronage in which Greek language and literature were
privileged (Hunter, this volume). Throughout the countr yside, an active encourage
ment of Greek schooling can be traced in the numbers of teachers in post and in the
salt-tax remission that they shared with coaches, actors and victorious athletes. The
sur vival and spread of Greek literar y works is witness to the speed and success of this
policy (Clar ysse 1983; LDAB). At the same time, the willingness of some Egyptians
to `go Greek', take on Greek names and adopt Greek ways (the acquisition, for
instance, of household slaves) is a not uncommon reaction to a new controlling
power. Moreover, the third-centur y status of `tax-Hellene' also brought some finan
cial benefits to its holders (D. J. Thompson 2001: 307).
The Ptolemies and Egypt 111



3 Ptolemies and Temples
Running the administration, the levy of rents and taxes, economic concerns and
matters of law and order form the regular stuf f of government. In Egypt, two fur ther
factors need consideration: the age-old power of the temples and the related role of
the Ptolemies themselves, the new r ulers of Egypt. The temples were major land
holders with developed economic institutions as well as centres of cult, and no
resident r uler could af ford to antagonize the gods of Egypt. Traditionally, the
pharaoh formed a key link between the gods and his people. Relations with the
temples took many dif ferent forms. Already as satrap, Ptolemy I had restored some
possessions to Delta temples (HÈ olbl 2001: 3) though, as becomes clear later on,
`restoration' might be a somewhat relative term in respect to control of land. Royal
rulings regulated the way that the temples were financed. In 263 the tax ( apomoira)
on vineyards and orchards was designated for the new cult of Arsinoe, the sister-wife
of Ptolemy II, who had been introduced as a temple-sharing goddess to all Egyptian
temples (Koenen 1993: 66±9; Clar ysse and Vandorpe 1998; Chaniotis, this volume).
As with other temple income, this was first collected and checked by crown of ficials
and only later passed on to the temple. In the second centur y a grant or syntaxis is
known which paid for the costs of cult and was administered by pharaoh's agents
within the temple. Meanwhile the temples enjoyed the freedom of r unning them
selves, but always within the overarching framework of the royal administration.
From Memphis, the former capital of the countr y, the gravestones of the high
priests of Ptah provide a lineage to set besides that of the Ptolemies. Over the three
centuries of Ptolemaic r ule, there were 13 high priests of Ptah to match the reigns of
13 Ptolemaic dynasts (D. J. Crawford 1980). The life histories of these priests, at least
in the first centur y, testify to their close relations with the cour t at Alexandria; the
exchange of state visits between r uler and high priest underlines the intimate involve
ment of these two authorities (D. J. Thompson 1988: 106±54). The royal coronation
± Egyptian style ± of the king took place in the temple of Ptah, at least from the reign
of Ptolemy V, and possibly even earlier.
At a national level it was for royal coronations and other major events that the
priests from all Egypt came together. In 196 the priestly representatives, who had
gathered to celebrate the recent coronation of Ptolemy V, produced the encyclical we
know as the Rosetta decree, famous for the role it played in the decipherment of
hieroglyphs (Parkinson 1999; Greek version, OGIS 90). As in the `Kanopos decree' of
238 (OGIS 56), the priests present themselves as enjoying a reciprocal relationship
with the crown in terms of mutual benefits (BD 164±5; Austin 222; 227). With a
heavy overlay of Egyptianizing imager y, the decree that the priests record has a basic
form that is Greek:
King Ptolemy . . . has conferred benefits in many ways on the temples and their staf fs and
on those subject to his r ule, as he is a god from a god and goddess just as Horus, the son
of Isis and Osiris, the defender of his father Osiris; (and) being in matters concerning the
gods benevolently inclined, he has assigned to the temples revenues in money and
grain . . . . With good for tune, it has been resolved by the priests of all the temples in
the land that [all] honours belonging to King Ptolemy, the eternal, beloved of Ptah, god
Epiphanes Eucharistos, and likewise those of his parents, the gods Philopatores and those
112 Dorothy J. Thompson



of his grandparents, the gods Euergetai [and] those of the gods Philadelphoi and those
of the gods Soteres, shall be increased greatly . . . (Clar ysse 2000a)
[and so on.]
Good relations were crucial and, in all impor tant respects, each understood the
other. The decree was set up bilingually in three scripts: in hieroglyphs, the ancient
script of Egypt, in demotic, its more cursive form, and in Greek, the language of the
new rulers. The honours granted the king were those of Egyptian religion, of statues,
crowns and statue cult, and the annual celebration of his bir thday and the day of his
accession.
4 The Ptolemaic Monarchy
Of the major Hellenistic kingdoms, Egypt was the most subject to monarchic rule.
With only three full Greek cities (Alexandria, Naukratis in the Delta and Ptolemais in
the south), it was through a centralized administration that the Ptolemies ruled.
Initiatives came as royal decrees but the king's physical presence, accompanied by
his family, was impor tant to his people (Clar ysse 2000b: 39± 40). In the mid second
centur y, for instance, the king was regularly present in the old Egyptian capital of
Memphis for 1 Thoth, the star t of the new year, and times of both trouble and
triumph were marked by royal progresses up and down the Nile. Religious festivals,
the inauguration of a temple, the installation of a sacred bull, were times of celebra
tion in Egyptian cultic life. Royal par ticipation helped to reinforce the monarchy (for
Ptolemy I as pharaoh, figure 7.2).
There was a Greek background too to monarchy. Since Xenophon's study of the
education of the Persian king Cyrus, the Cyropaedia, treatises on kingship had
entered literar y production. Plutarch records the advice given to Ptolemy I to acquire
such studies on kingship; they contained advice that even a king's best friend would
hesitate to give him (Mor. 189d). The king surely had many friends; the title of
`friend' became an official one for trusted cour tiers and, as elsewhere in the Hellenis
tic world, the system was soon broadened out with `first friends', `relatives of the
king' and other such ranks defined in a cour t hierarchy (Mooren 1977; Herman
1997). Those who ran the royal administration were fitted into this honorific struc
ture.
The pharaoh's image was also impor tant. Here too the Ptolemies conformed to a
more general pattern discussed elsewhere in this volume (cf. Ma in chapter 11). The
use of royal epithets star ted with Ptolemy I, who was also known as Soter (Saviour).
As though echoing this epithet it was, according to the poet Poseidippos, a statue of
Zeus Soter that topped the Pharos, the great lighthouse of Alexandria. Later kings
(with their queens) adopted similar epithets: Ptolemy II Philadelphos (sister-loving),
Ptolemy III Euergetes (benefactor), Ptolemy IV Philopator (father-loving), Ptolemy
V Epiphanes (made manifest), and so on. Such epithets cer tainly carried divine
connotations for their holders though not yet full divine status. For Ptolemaic
kings and queens, that came in other ways.
In Alexandria the foundation of a cult to Alexander provided through its priest a
new way of dating the years (`in the reign of Ptolemy, in the priesthood of Menelaos
son of Lagos for the fifth year' is how 284 was marked in one text (P.Hib. I 84a.1±2);
The Ptolemies and Egypt 113



Figure 7.2 Ptolemy I: Macedonian Pharaoh. # British Museum, London
as Soter's brother, Menelaos was a wor thy holder of the post (Clar ysse and Van der
Veken 1983: 4) ). In 272/271 the cult, as Theoi Adelphoi (brother/sister gods), of
the ruling sovereign and his queen (Ptolemy Philadelphos and Queen Arsinoe) was
added to that of Alexander as, in time, was that of successive kings and queens. By the
reign of Ptolemy IV what had now become a tr ue dynastic cult was granted its own
cult quar ters in Alexandria: the SÃ ema or S Ã oma, where the mummified remains of
Alexander and the Ptolemies were on display. In the same reign, a similar cult was
initiated in the south at Ptolemais, where Soter, as that city's founder, took the place
of Alexander. Regularly employed in the dating formula for all legal contracts and
of ficial texts, the dynastic priesthood together with related priestesses for Ptolemaic
queens of fered a role for the sons and daughters of prominent families in both
Alexandria and Ptolemais. Centred in these two cities, this was a Greek dynastic cult.
In the Egyptian temples, royal cult was somewhat dif ferent. Already in the Luxor
temple, Alexander had been shown on temple walls as pharaoh of fering cult to the
local god, but it was Arsinoe, sister-wife of Ptolemy II, who was the first of the
Ptolemies to be introduced to Egyptian temples, as a temple-sharing goddess wor
shipped alongside the cult of the main divinity (HÈ olbl 2001: 85, 101±3). The
114 Dorothy J. Thompson



innovation proved a great success and was followed by successive kings and, par ticu
larly, queens (Quaegebeur 1988; 1989). Indeed, the royal names of Arsinoe and
Berenike entered the other wise exclusively Egyptian nomenclature of priestly families.
Ruler cult can play an impor tant role in binding a kingdom together. So it was with
the Ptolemies. Images were produced, of dif ferent materials and size to suit the
pockets of those who bought them; they enjoyed wide circulation. Royal oaths played
a par t in formal under takings; sacrifices to the rulers would form the start to any
senior official's day. When kings are divine, they enjoy an added strength and
authority. As priests and, simultaneously, as gods, the Ptolemies enjoyed an embed
ded position within Egyptian society.
5 The Troubled Second Century
In a land sur vey from Edfu south of Thebes, year 16 of Ptolemy IV Philopator (207/
206) was a defining year (P.Haun.inv. 417); as recorded on the temple walls of the
great temple of Horus there, in that year `ignorant rebels' interrupted the building
works. In Thebes, no taxes were paid to the royal bank from September 207 until
192/191. In effect, there was civil war in the region, as the old centre of Thebes and
much of the south came under the control of rebel pharaohs, first Haronnophris
(205±199) and then Chaonnophris (199±192/191) (Pestman 1995). Their ver y
names carr y meaning: `Horus is Osiris' and `Osiris still lives'. The powerful gods of
Egypt backed these new pharaohs in their control of Upper Egypt. The knot that tied
the two lands was loosed; the land of the white crown, the realm of the bee, was lost
to Ptolemy, who now held Lower Egypt only, land of the red crown, realm of the
sedge.
This was a hard time for Egypt and its people. Trouble at cour t compounded that
in the south. In Alexandria, a palace coup had resulted in the death (in 204) of
Ptolemy IV and his more popular queen, Arsinoe III. Ptolemy V was merely a
youngster under the control of more sinister figures at the court. With the south in
revolt, the young king came under attack from the east and along the Phoenician
coast. The battle of Panion on the edge of the Golan Heights in 200 brought an end
to Ptolemaic control of the area. It was in this troubled period that the king
celebrated, first, his coming of age in Alexandria and then, on 27 November 197,
his coronation as pharaoh in Memphis. This royal coronation was the occasion for the
priestly convention that resulted in the Rosetta decree (OGIS 90).
It was not until 186 that, somewhere further to the south, Chaonnophris was
finally defeated by Komanos, general of Ptolemy V. The ef fects of the rebellion were
felt for many generations. One resulting dispute over a house in Thebes, appropriated
in the time of the `trouble' under Ptolemy V, was still before the courts in 125. The
case was finally thrown out in 117, some 88 years after the complainant's father had
left town to fight (UPZ II 160±2 P.Tor.Choach. nos. 11±12). In times of trouble,
property was rarely secure; deeds might be lost or burnt, and general insecurities and
local conflicts came to the sur face (SB V 8033 [182 B C ]; VIII 9681 [175±169 B C ]).
Some thir ty years later Antiochos IV of Syria took advantage of fur ther internal
unrest, this time among the two sons of Ptolemy V. He invaded Egypt in two
successive years (170/168) and was crowned king at Memphis. It was a rough time
for Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VIII, who despite an uneasy coalition found that many
The Ptolemies and Egypt 115



impor tant Egyptians joined the Syrian cause (P .Ko È ln IV 186). The Syrian king only
left the countr y when Rome inter vened. In an encounter at Eleusis outside Alexan
dria, the Roman envoy handed Antiochos an ultimatum and drew a circle round him
on the ground. He should agree to Roman terms, leaving Egypt by a given date,
before he stepped out of the circle. The king complied (McGing, this volume, section
1, Diod. 31.1±2; Polyb. 29.27; Ray 1976: 127).
Trouble, however, continued and in their joint rule the two sons of Ptolemy V were
far from reconciled. Shor tly after, a fur ther revolt was raised by one Dionysios
Petosarapis (Diod. 31.15). This time, trouble star ted at cour t with a prominent
militar y man. Dionysios is described by Diodoros, our only source for these events,
as a `friend' of the king, as well as an individual with a good militar y record. His
second name ± `gift of Sarapis' ± may have been adopted when he went into rebellion.
Dionysios sought to exploit the rivalr y of the kings and, in doing so, he involved
the Alexandrian populace. There was a demonstration in the stadium ± a favourite
place for such events ± and Dionysios sought to establish the younger Ptolemy VIII
in place of his older brother, Ptolemy VI. The two kings refused to be used, though
some 4000 soldiers still rose to suppor t Dionysios. He fled to the eastern suburb of
Eleusis where he was defeated. Plunging naked into the river, he swam across and
retreated to the Egyptians whom he incited to revolt. Many indeed came to join him
and documents from the period bear testimony to the widespread nature of the
ensuing upheaval. Attacks were made on local temples ± this was no straightfor ward
Greek/Egyptian conflict ± existing enmities played out (McGing 1997).
There was still more trouble in the Thebaid. In the countr yside more generally
dissident elements took advantage of the situation to forcibly eject homeowners, burn
records, or pursue personal vendettas (Chrest.W ilck 9.31±6 [165 B C ]); UPZ I 19.6±9
[163 B C ]). From Memphis the loss of burial stelae for Apis bulls and high priests of
Ptah in this period is just one sign of these troubled times. In Pathyris no taxes were
paid in the years 168±165 (Vandorpe 2000a: 406). For the same three years, the
priests failed to chant the titulature of the king following the `invasion of the Mede',
as Antiochos is termed in an Egyptian graf fito from Elephantine (Vittmann 1997:
264). No eponymous priests are known in Alexandria from 169 to 165 (Clar ysse and
Van der Veken 1983: 26); chanting only recommenced at the end of year 5, in late
September 165. There can be no clearer statement of the loss of Ptolemaic control.
As is often the case in war time, those not directly involved suf fered the most, as
illustrated by Isias in the letter to her husband quoted on p. 71 above. Bad times led
to high prices and life was hard for Hephaistion's wife, child and mother. As if to
reinforce the plea for her husband's return, Isias appends her own signature to the
letter (Cribiore 2001: 91). The explanation for these and later troubles is normally
presented in terms of growing native unrest. The Achaian historian Polybios is
responsible for this emphasis when he comments on the ef fects of the battle of
Raphia, the engagement in which Ptolemy IV Philopator had finally won the Four th
Syrian War (219±217) and recovered Hollow Syria:
The king just mentioned, in arming the Egyptians for the war against Antiochos, was
pursuing a policy which was expedient in present circumstances but out of line for the
future. For the Egyptians were elated by the success at Raphia and could no longer
endure to take orders, but looked out for a leader and a figurehead, thinking they were
116 Dorothy J. Th ompson



well able to maintain themselves as an independent power. In this they finally succeeded
not long after wards. (Polyb. 5.107.1±3; Austin 225)
Polybios later describes the ensuing struggles not as a regular war with pitched
battles, naval encounters, sieges and events wor thy of note but rather as characterized
by mutual savager y and general lawlessness (Polyb. 14.12.3±4). How far can his
analysis be accepted?
Polybios, depor ted to Rome after the battle of Pydna in 168 and an admirer of that
city's power, perhaps visited Egypt sometime later as par t of a Roman embassy
(Walbank 1979b); he is likely to have thought long and hard about Egypt which
was still an independent power. He sees events in militar y terms, with a tension
existing between those who give and those who receive orders. The latter of course
were Egyptians, and though these might be called `ignorant' or `impious' rebels (as
on the temple walls at Edfu or in the Rosetta decree) or, more often, simply natives
(
encho Ã rioi), it is only in the revolt of Thebes with its native pharaohs that any real
ethnic element or secessionist movement can be traced. Even then Upper Egypt was
far from united. Whereas in some more recent accounts a nationalist Egyptian agenda
has been stressed, it is notable that contemporar y descriptions are rather made in
terms of `trouble' or `upset' (tarache Ã ) or of non-dealing (ameixia). Rebellion, as so
often, took many dif ferent forms; it is not easy to disentangle the dif ferent strands or
dif ferent groups who were involved within the population (Pestman 1995; McGing
1997).
Despite attempts to deal with the troubles (UPZ I 110; 163), from this date, as
already seen at Eleusis, a new power enters the picture. In the continuing struggles, it
is to Rome that Ptolemies increasingly flee in hope of restoration ± Ptolemy VI, VIII
and, most disastrously, XII all made that journey. Rome was now an ever-present
force. In Alexandria problems continued at cour t, af fecting the rest of the kingdom.
On the death of his elder brother in 145, Ptolemy VIII took over the throne and also,
as queen, his brother's widow, Kleopatra II, who was also their sister. Not long after,
he took as second queen his niece, Kleopatra III, the daughter of his existing wife.
This dynamite exploded in a civil war between the two queens (132±130). In middle
Egypt, sur veys of the Arsinoite and Herakleopolite nomes record land as being from
`before year 39' (132/131) and `after year 40' (131/130), but still in year 43 (128/
127) the eponymous priests are listed not, as usually, `in Alexandria' but rather in `the
camp of the king' (BGU III 993.ii.6±7). Kings in trouble needed their priests to
endorse their rule with chanting. Ptolemy VIII eventually came out on top and the
two queens were reconciled, but the insecurity of rule and latent splits within the
kingdom had once again been revealed: Alexandria and the countr yside, dif ferent
groups within the capital, Greeks and Egyptians, Upper and Lower Egypt. The
hostile reaction of some Egyptians to what was still seen as foreign rule ± the rule
of the `girdle-bearers' (one of the many forms of paramilitar y police) with their `city
by the sea', can be found in the Potter's oracle, an apocalyptic text which foretells
destruction to the Greeks and their rule upheld by force; in age-old eastern imager y,
the gods of Egypt would return home together with their statues (P .Rainer G.19 813
in Koenen 1968: 200±9, cf. Burstein 106).
On the death of Ptolemy VIII in 116, the power of his younger widow over the
succession of her two sons, Ptolemy IX Soter and Ptolemy X Alexander, again
The Ptolemies and Egypt 117



brought civil war to Egypt. Succession to the throne remained a flash point. So too
did the south, par ticularly Thebes, eventually destroyed by Ptolemy IX after another
fierce uprising in 88. The historically valuable cache of some hundreds of priestly
statues buried beneath a cour t in the Karnak temple (de Meulenaere 1995: 83± 4)
may belong to this sack of the city when, in the words of Pausanias (1.9.5), the king
`did such damage that there was nothing left to remind the Thebans of their former
prosperity'. Pausanias reflects the Alexandrian view. Thebes in practice recovered,
with the suppor t of its well-established Greco-Egyptian families (OGIS 186 (62 B C );
194 (39 B C ), translated Burstein 110±11). It was to revolt again in the early years of
Roman control.
6 Egypt and Rome
Following the troubles under Ptolemies VIII Euergetes II, IX Soter and X Alexander,
Rome was an ever-present player in the period. Ptolemies now visited Rome; Roman
senators in turn came to Egypt. It was to the nor th-west and no longer Seleukid Asia
that the focus had turned. Yet Egypt was the last of the Hellenistic kingdoms to fall to
Rome, and her ability to avoid an earlier takeover must to some degree reflect
Ptolemaic success as much as Roman unwillingness to get embroiled in actual control
of this rich province.
It was indeed the wealth of Egypt which was noted by visiting Romans. When
Scipio Aemilianus visited the countr y with a Roman embassy in 140/139, the visitors
were horrified by the lavishness of Ptolemaic hospitality but impressed by the natural
resources of Egypt, par ticularly the flood of the Nile; all it lacked was rulers wor thy of
their kingdom (Diod. 33.28b.1±3; Athen. 12.549 d±e).
Two features of the later period of Ptolemaic rule reflect growing weakness at the
centre. Egypt and her key territories of Cyrene and Cyprus no longer formed an
entity. In 163, for instance, Ptolemy VI Philometor controlled Egypt and Cyprus
while his brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II ruled Cyrene; in 107 there was a three
way split, with Ptolemy X Alexander I in Egypt, Ptolemy IX Soter II in Cyprus and
Ptolemy Apion in Cyrene. Such a division of territor y and interests was not to Egypt's
advantage.
A second feature which marks the period is the practice pioneered in Egypt of
leaving a kingdom to Rome. The first example came in 155, when Ptolemy VIII
(from Cyrene) made a conditional legacy to Rome of `his rightful kingdom' should he
die a childless death (SEG 9.7). Such a bid for Rome's suppor t was perhaps a form of
insurance policy against attack from his brother; it was never put into ef fect. Others,
however, followed suit ± Attalos III of Pergamon in 133 and Ptolemy Apion, who on
his death in 96 willed Cyrene to Rome. Finally, in 87 Ptolemy X Alexander left Egypt
to Rome (Badian 1967). Rome only took the legacy up in 58, when eventually she
annexed Cyprus (only). Egypt proper remained intact. When Ptolemy XII Auletes
died in 51, he failed to leave Rome his kingdom outright; it was simply left under the
guardianship of that power.
Rome, however, was not a power to go away, and in the last generations of
Ptolemaic Egypt domestic developments and policies became increasingly subordin
ated to that power. Ejected by his subjects from his throne when Rome took Cyprus
over, Ptolemy XII used up all the surplus of his wealthy kingdom and promised much
118 Dorothy J. Thompson



more in his ef for ts at restoration. Figures in ancient sources are notoriously unreliable
but Cicero is claimed to have repor ted an annual income from Egypt of some 12,000
talents (Strabo 17.1.13). Half of that sum was earlier promised by Auletes to Pompey
and Caesar for his recognition as friend and ally of Rome, and when eventually the
governor of Syria moved to put him back in power his bribe stood at 10,000 talents.
The last thir ty years of Ptolemaic rule were a dif ficult time for Egypt and Kleopatra
VII who, inheriting her father's debts and an encumbered throne, was obliged
seriously to devalue the currency and even, after Actium, to plunder the temples
(Dio 51.5.4±5). Earlier, under Ptolemy II, it had been high of ficials who were
granted gift-estates and other privileges. In these final years, it was Antony's general
Publius Canidius who received preferential treatment:
We have allowed to Publius Canidius and his heirs annually to expor t 10,000 ar tabas of
wheat c. 400,000 litres and to impor t 5000 Koan amphoras of wine, free of tax levied by
anyone and of any other charge whatsoever. And we have also granted him to
be untouched in respect of all the lands that he holds in the countr yside. He is to be
given exemption for the present and future both from charges for the regular govern
ment account and for that of me and my children . . .
is the star t of a royal order from 33 which records this (van Minnen 2000). Egypt's
agricultural wealth was now in others' hands. So soon was the rest of Kleopatra's
kingdom. As victor at Actium, Octavian took Alexandria on 3 August 30. When
invited, the new r uler refused to visit the Apis bull (Dio 51.16.5, 17.4±5). Concili
ation was not the Roman way. Kleopatra died soon after, a self-inflicted royal death
from a cobra's fangs, but Caesar's son Ptolemy XV, her designated heir, was not to
succeed her. The Romans had come to stay.

The period is well ser ved both by general studies and by collections of (mainly
papyrological) sources in translation which provide an introduction to the possibil

is a detailed political study of the whole period, not just of Egypt, cf. Green 1990,
Shipley 2000. Bowman 1986, with good illustrations, introduces Egypt also in the
Roman period. Turner 1984 and D. J. Thompson 1994a treat the Ptolemies only, as
does A. Lloyd 2000, with an emphasis on the Egyptian side which is shared by the
best general coverage, HÈ olbl 2001. Huss 2001 (in German) is the fullest of recent
studies, reasonably conventional in coverage; his renumbering of the later Ptolemies
is likely to prove problematic. Of the source books, Austin 1981, Bagnall and Derow
2004, Burstein 1985 and Rowlandson 1998 (on women) are all probably the best
collections. On papyri, see Erskine, this volume, section 5 with fur ther reading there.

CHAPTER EIGHT
The Seleukids and Asia
Michel Austin
Not infected by the Christian zeal which later became the liberal itch, the Seleucids did
not tr y to convert anybody ± either to the true religion or good plumbing. They left
people as dir ty and blissful as they had been before the Macedonian conquest. `A wise
and salutar y neglect' [. . .] maintained peace within the Seleucid Empire. (Bickerman
1966: 97)
1 Introduction
The Seleukids reckoned the year when Seleukos recovered control of Babylon from his
rival Antigonos as the beginning of their empire (October 312 in the Macedonian
calendar, April 311 in the Babylonian). This was the star t of the `Seleukid era', a novel
method of reckoning by the continuous years of the dynasty and not by the years of
individual kings. From then on the sequence of rulers ran down to 63 when Pompey
deposed the last king in the dynasty and created the Roman province of Syria. The
name `Seleukids', though conventional and convenient, is actually used by only one
ancient writer (App. Syr. 48±50, 65, 67). It is not found anywhere else and is
completely missing from the numerous Greek inscriptions that relate to the Seleukid
kings or emanate from them. Literar y sources refer to them in a variety of ways ±
among others `the kings descended from Seleukos', or `the kings of Asia', or the `kings
of Syria/the Syrians', or `the Syrian kings'. The last two designations are the most
common, though they are not attested before the second centur y (first in Polybios), in
the latter par t of which the Seleukid empire was progressively reduced to its Syrian
component, sizeable but only a fraction of the whole. One other collective designa
tion frequently found in classical writers is simply `the Macedonians' (Edson 1958),
whose rule over Asia followed that of the Persians in a succession of eastern empires, a
scheme first formulated in Herodotos (1.95±6, 130; cf. Polyb. 29.21).
None of these designations was used by the rulers, who consistently describe
themselves in their letters, inscriptions, and coins simply as `King Seleukos',
`King Antiochos' etc., and never as kings of any par ticular land, countr y or people.
Royalty was thus a matter of recognized personal status, not tied to a specific ethnic



or geographical context, and there was no `of ficial' description of the Seleukid
empire.
2 The Seleukid Empire
The Seleukid empire was an ar tificial construct, created piecemeal by Seleukos I over
his long career, and handed over to his successors as an inheritance, to be preser ved,
recovered if any par t was lost, or even enlarged if the oppor tunity arose. It therefore
had no pre-existing shape, and no final shape either. Whether Seleukos had a clear and
consistent imperial vision from early in his career cannot be determined. At any rate
his ambitions grew with success and seemingly embraced vast designs. Alone of his
rivals he named not just cities after himself and members of his family (Seleukeia,
Antioch, Laodikeia, Apameia) but entire regions: the name Seleukis to describe
Nor th Syria, and perhaps an even wider expanse of territor y, is attested early in the
reign of his son and successor Antiochos I (OGIS 219; Austin 139). Repor tedly he
and his son wanted to give the Indian Ocean the names Seleukis and Antiochis (Pliny
HN 2.167±8). No less ambitious in its implications was the introduction of the
Seleukid era, possibly by Antiochos I rather than Seleukos himself (Sher win-White
and Kuhr t 1993: 27).
But Seleukos' work was left unfinished. At the end of his life in 281 his empire
stretched from Baktria in the east to the Levantine coast and the Hellespont; he had just
acquired control of western Asia Minor and established a foothold in Thrace on the
European mainland, repor tedly on his way to take control of the vacant throne of
Macedon. This latter ambition soon had to be dropped by Antiochos I after his
accession. Dif ferent par ts of the empire were controlled to var ying degrees: there is
an obvious contrast between the regions acquired early and consolidated, and those
that Seleukos had not had time to assimilate ef fectively. Thus he placed his stamp firmly
on Babylonia and Nor th Syria with major new foundations ± Seleukeia on the Tigris in
Babylonia, Antioch, Seleukeia in Pieria, Apameia and Laodikeia by the sea in Nor th
Syria. But other areas were problematic. Considerable time and energy were devoted
by Antiochos I under Seleukos in an apparent ef for t to establish control over the `upper
satrapies' to the east of Mesopotamia, but with only mixed results. Western Asia Minor,
the domain of at first Antigonos then L ysimachos, was a recent acquisition and
remained contested ground between a series of protagonists, a constant source of
dif ficulties despite intensive ef for ts by successive rulers. After Ipsos in 301 Seleukos
had also had to yield temporarily to Ptolemy his claims to Koile Syria, and his ambitions
to develop maritime power in the Levant remained unfulfilled. Seleukid weakness at sea
was never made good subsequently, and Koile Syria was a recurring source of friction
between the two dynasties. The chequered histor y of the Seleukid empire after the
death of its founder is outlined elsewhere in this volume and will not be repeated here.
For all its territorial fluctuations the empire remained in essence similar through
out: a conglomerate of many dif ferent peoples and lands who happened to be at any
given time under Seleukid rule. There was no way of describing the empire apar t from
the person of its ruler: when the Romans imposed the Peace of Apameia on Antiochos
III in 188, they demanded compliance from `Antiochos and those under his orders'
(hypotassamenoi, Polyb. 21.43 cf. 11.34; the phrase is common). The hallmarks of the
empire were territorial expansion and diversity of peoples and cultures. It fell into
122 Michel Austin



major geographical regions ± Babylonia, western Iran and to the east the `upper
satrapies' as far as Baktria; to the west Nor th Syria and western Asia Minor. For
administrative purposes the empire was divided into territorial provinces adapted
from Persian practice (mostly satrapies), though their number and size fluctuated.
But the constituent elements were smaller entities. A decree of Smyrna from the reign
of Seleukos II provides a convenient shor thand:
(King Seleukos) guaranteed to the people (sc. of Smyrna) its autonomy and democracy,
and wrote to the kings, the dynasts, the cities and the peoples requesting that the
sanctuar y of Aphrodite Stratonikis be recognised as inviolate and our city as holy and
inviolate. (OGIS 229; Austin 182)
This gives a summar y of the political entities known to the world of the time (not just
in the Seleukid empire): kings ± the major monarchies of the day, rulers with the royal
title basileus like the Seleukids themselves; dynasts ± numerous petty rulers not of royal
status, whose sphere of power was generally local, such as Olympichos of Labraunda
in Karia, active from the reigns of Seleukos II to the early years of Antiochos III and
known chiefly from a series of inscriptions from Labraunda (Isager 1990: 84±8); ver y
numerous cities with their own political institutions, Greek and non-Greek, some
ancient, others newly founded; and peoples whose organization was not based on the
city model, such as the Jews in Palestine. To these might be added `temple-states',
where a sanctuar y of a god or goddess controlled land and peoples from which
revenues were raised, such as the sanctuar y of Zeus of Baetokaike in Nor th Syria,
known from an inscription involving a King Antiochos of uncer tain date and identity
(RC 70; Austin 178).
As the Smyrna decree shows, Seleukid kings assumed the continued existence of all
such entities and dealt with them on an individual basis, dispensing status, privileges
or punishment in return for loyalty displayed or withheld. The empire was thus like a
network of bilateral relationships between the ruling king and the communities in
their sphere of power. The links probably had to be renewed or at least confirmed at
the accession of a new ruler (cf. OGIS 223; RC 15; Austin 183: embassy from
Er ythrai to Antiochos I or II): the empire was as it were recreated with each successive
king. All this generated a vast amount of communications and correspondence, only
par tly reflected in the sur viving evidence.
There is no reason to suppose that Seleukid rule was in the first instance anything
but an imposition on the peoples of the empire. Even communities that outwardly
professed loyalty saw them as outsiders. For instance a decree of Ilion in the Troad in
honour of (probably) Antiochos I after his accession implies that cities like Ilion and
the Seleukid kingdom were distinct entities:
He (sc. the king) has come to the provinces this side of Mt Tauros (i.e. Asia Minor) . . .
and has at once restored peace to the cities and has advanced his interests and the
kingdom to a more powerful and brilliant position. (OGIS 219; Austin 139)
There was thus no automatic reason for the subjects to accept Seleukid rule, which
lacked any ultimate legitimacy, no matter how much rulers might tr y to enhance their
own status. From inscriptions it is known that Antiochos III created a divine cult of
The Seleukids and Asia 123



his living queen Laodik e in 193, modelle d on a cult of hims elf cr eated some time
earlier, and ef fect ive througho ut the em pire (Austi n 158; She r win -White and Kuhr t
1993: 203±10) . But no literar y source makes any menti on of this in the nar rative of
events in the 190s when A ntiochos was attem pting to re-est ablish Seleuki d r ule in
Asia Minor and Thr ace: the stor y is told in purely pol itical an d mil itar y ter ms.
The sinceri ty of outward exp ressions of loyal ty to the r ulers can nev er b e taken at
face value, and commun iti es could move in and out of the Sel eukid alle giance
depen ding on chang ing circum stances. Mil etos, cour te d alread y by Seleuko s I not
least because of the sanctu ar y of Apollo at Didyma , from whom the dynast y claimed
to be desce nded, is found in the Ptolema ic orbit in the reign of Ptole my II ( RC 1 4;
Austin 270), but rever ts to the Seleuki d fo ld under Seleuko s II ( RC 2 2; Austin 186) .
In their commun icat ions with the city n either king lets it out that Miletos had
changed its allegiance more than once. Smyr na, obsequi ous in its profe ssion of loyal ty
to Seleukos II (OGI S 229; Austin 182), is found in the 190s makin g a deter mined
stand against Antio chos III and seekin g Rom an suppor t aga inst him (Liv y 33.38).
Nor was this confined to par ts of the empir e that might be though t of as `perip heral'.
Seleukeia in Pieria, one of the four majo r Seleukid citi es in Nor th Syria, where
Seleuko s I was buried , was under Ptole maic cont rol from 241 to 219 (Po lyb.
5.58±61) . T o attemp t to draw maps of the Seleukid em pire with clear-cut `frontier s'
is misl eadin g.
The loyal ty or at least acquies cence of subjec ts thus depen ded ulti mately on self
interest and the c hanging cir cumstance s of the mome nt. Seleuki d r ule had to rely on a
judicious blend o f pressur e an d persuasion, as may be seen from the acti vities of
Antiocho s III in Asia Minor in 197/6:
In the same year King Antiochos . . . sought to bring all the cities of Asia back to their
for mer status within the empire. He could see that the remainder would submit to his
r ule without dif ficulty . . . but Smyr na and Lampsakos were asser ting their freedom and
there was a danger that if they were granted what they sought, other cities might follow
their example. And so he himself sent an ar my from Ephesos to besiege Smyr na and
ordered the troops stationed at Abydos to proceed to the siege of Lampsakos . . . . In fact
he was not relying so much on the fear inspired by force, but through envoys he would
send them conciliator y messages and reproach them for their rashness and obstinacy; he
sought in this way to raise the hope that they would soon have what they were seeking,
but only when it was suf ficiently clear to themselves and to all others that it was from the
king that they had obtained their freedom and that they had not seized it in favourable
circumstances. (Livy 33.38)
It should be add ed that Antio chos' hopes wer e not fulfilled: several years later,
Smyr na and Lam psakos we re still resist ing the king (Ma 1999: 94±100, 173±4).
3 The Seleukids as a Military Monarchy
It will be seen that the Seleuki d monar chy was in the first insta nce militar y in character . It
was no t a consti tutional ent ity but had at its core a hum an group, unelect ed and unac
countable : the `king, his fri ends, and his mil itar y forces', to use a phrase that appear s in
texts and document s of the period. Simply put, the mon archy cons isted of the king as
war leade r and his band of followers: their cohesi on was cemented by a commo n inter est
124 Michel Austin



in mai ntaining cont rol o f an empir e from which they deriv ed their wealt h a nd status .
The primar y function of em pire, from the point of view of the r ulers, was to d raw on the
resource s, materi al and hum an, provide d by the subjec t peoples. Taxatio n in whate ver
for m was thus the hallmark of mon archical r ule, and tax-exe mpt ions always a special
privileg e carefull y me ntioned as su ch (cf . van der Spek 2000) .
The mil itar y charact er of the mon archy can be illustr ated in many way s (A ustin
1986). As the age of the Succe ssors had sh own, royal statu s was deriv ed in the firs t
instance from militar y achievement. Commenting on Antiochos III's eastern anabasis
of 212±205 Polybi os writ es: `It was this campai gn whi ch made him appe ar wor thy of
royalty , not only to the peop les of Asia but to those in Europe as well' (11.3 4). V ictor y
gave the r u ler posse ssion of ter ritor y and peoples: the empi re was `ter ritor y won by the
spear' (doriktetos chora), a concept the Seleukids appealed to subsequently in justifica
tion of their r ule (Po lyb. 5.67 in 219/18 ; 28.1 .4 in 170/69 ). T he major steps in the
growt h or cont raction of the em pire related to militar y events : nota bly the battle s of
Ipsos in 301 (gain of Nor th Syri a from Antigon os), Koroupe dion in 282 (ga in of Asia
Mino r from L ysimachos ), Pan ion in c. 200 (gain of Koile Syria from Ptolemy V),
Magne sia in 189 (loss of A sia Minor), or the defea t and deat h of A ntiochos VII in
130±29 (f inal loss of Mesopo tamia and all the easter n province s). The kings expect ed
to take personal co mmand of major campai gns, mai ntained a close person al relation
ship with the soldiers , and are shown in acti on predo minantly in militar y contexts. It
has b een debat ed what was the `centre' of the Sel eukid empire, and what was its
`capital city' . The debate may be somewh at ar tificial and the answer depen ds on the
period concer ned. The `c entre' was in practice wher ever the king happened to be, and
kings were freque ntly on the move: the caree rs of Sel eukos I and An tiochos III took
them from one end of their empi re to the other (Austin 2001: 1 02).
Polybi os' nar rative of the early reig n of Antio chos III gi ves a goo d glimpse of the
Seleuki d mon archy in action ove r a period of seve ral years, from 223 til l 217 (see esp .
5.41 ±2, 45, 49±52, 55±6, 58). The materi al is clearl y derived from a well-info r med
source which rem ains cha racteristi cally anony mous (Po lybios him self was not even
bor n at the time). The ch ief busine ss of the monarchy is assume d to be war: the death
of a king and the accessio n of the n ext r uler we re alw ays a time of danger fo r the
mon archy and oppor tunity fo r its oppon ents, inter nal o r exter nal, and a new king had
to prov e hims elf through acti on (A ntiochos III's pre decessor and elder br other
Seleuko s III had been as sassinat ed in Asia Minor in 223 after a sho r t reign). The
question at iss ue in Polybios ' account is whi ch of the variou s milit ar y tasks An tiochos
III should concen trate on him self or deleg ate to o thers ± deali ng with Molo n, the
rebelliou s satrap of Me dia, o r resum ing war a gainst Ptolemy . Deci sions we re made
within a ver y res tricted circ le ± the king himself and the most influen tial of his
followers and adviso rs ± hence per sonalitie s det er min e policy . The attack and recap ture
of Sel eukeia in Pieria from Ptole my IV in 219 was due to the per sonal inter ventio n of
Apollop hanes, the king' s doct or, who was him self from Seleukeia: no one had appar
ently paid any attention to the fact that the city had been in Ptole maic hands for two
decades (5.58±61). In ge neral all concer ned as sumed that milit ar y forces wer e avail able
for use, but no calcula tion s seem to have bee n made as to the expected costs and
benef its of any given campai gn. Speci alization of gover nment al functio ns at the
highest lev els was conspicuous b y its abs ence. St ill less did the leading figu res give
any thou ght to the possi ble impact of milit ar y acti vity on the peop les of the em pire.
The Seleukids and Asia 125



From the per spective of the subjec ts, milit ar y pressur es we re a recur ring manifest
ation of Sel eukid r ule. A fter the defea t of Antio chos III at Magne sia in 189 the
peoples of Asia Mino r looke d fo r ward to being relie ved of `tribute , gar risons and
other royal injunc tions' (Polyb. 21.4 1.2). Gar risons appe ar to have bee n nor mal in all
the maj or Seleuki d centr es (Babylon , the four maj or cities in Nor th Syria et c.) but are
also found else where (Ma 1999: 113±21, 139±40, 155). Occasionall y the evid ence
provide s an insight into the impac t of war in one par t of the empir e on anot her area,
as kno wn for ins tance from an as tronomic al diar y from Babylon concer ning the war
between Antio chos I and Ptole my II Phi ladelph os in 27 4/3 (cit ed in She r win -White
and Kuhr t 1993: 46). At times of milit ar y acti vity ther e was a recur ring problem in
contro lling the actio ns of the ar my: not even Antiochos III could secure the discip line
of his soldier s towards the local populati ons (A ustin 2001: 92 and n. 8). It goes
without saying that many par ts of the empi re will of ten have bee n at peace, but the
available evidenc e makes it imposs ible to docum ent this.
4 The Kings and Their Subjects
Milita r y pressures, over t or impl icit, could not be the only way of maintai ning the
obedience of subjec ts. In a worl d whe re public opi nion matt ered the kings were
sensitive to their rep utation, and royal discours e was adap ted to su it local audie nces.
From num erous Gre ek inscript ions in Asia Mino r one gai ns the impre ssion that the
Seleuki ds cared for Gre ek ideals ± the protectio n of the Gre eks, the democracy and
autonomy of the citi es, their political har mony and prosperity (e.g.OGI S 222; Austin
143: the League of Ionians; OGIS 229; Austin 182: Smyr na; OGIS 237; Ma 1999
no. 26B, 331±4: Iasos). Elsewhere the languag e was mod ified: the old classical
antithes is bet ween Gre eks and the `bar barians of A sia' was inapp ropriate in an empire
that was mostly non-G reek. Hence the rhetoric of defence aga inst bar barians could
only be appli ed sele ctively , to peo ples outside the empi re, as the nomads of central
Asia (Polyb. 11.3 4.5), or the T hracians in Europ e (Ma 1999: 91), or to a spe cial case
like the Celtic tribes that cau sed havoc in Europe an d we ster n Asia Mino r (Paus.
10.20.5, cf. Pol yb. 21.4 1.2). But at Babylon Antio chos I used traditio nal Babyloni an
ter minolog y to pre sent him self as legitimat e king and protector of Babyloni an cult s
and traditio ns (Austin 189; Kuhr t and She r win -White 1991). A fter the con quest of
Koile Syri a from Ptolemy V in c. 200 Antio chos III gran ted throug h his gover nor
variou s favours and fiscal privileg es to the Jews and guarante ed them the use of their
national customs (Jos. AJ 12.138±46).
The sinceri ty or other wise of su ch pron ounce ments is perhap s no t a rele vant issue:
the for mal languag e of diplomat ic relat ions fo llowed conve ntions that were us ed and
understo od by all sides. It is usually imposs ible to a ssess the degree of loyal ty or
resistance to Seleuki d r ule, which wil l have dep ended on circums tances and the
balance of pressures at any gi ven time . It can be assume d from various indication s
that the Seleuki d king s will have had their local su ppor ters in indiv idual commun iti es,
a regular techniqu e of all ancie nt em pires. Gre ek writers for their par t did not mince
words: `the king s wer e anxious to dest roy the democracy in the cities' (Memn on
FGrH 434 F11); `at the star t of their reign all king s may dang le the name of freedom
and call friends and allies those who sh are in their hopes, bu t once the y are involved in
gover nment they deal with those who tr usted the m no long er as allies but as mast ers'
126 Michel Austin



(Polyb. 15.24). These writers were of course thinking in the first instance of the
relations between the kings and the Greek world: how the Seleukids dealt with their
non-Greek subjects was of lesser concern to them.
Modern perceptions of the Seleukids have evolved in time and mirror to some
extent the rise and fall of European colonial histor y. In the early twentieth centur y
one influential approach saw the Seleukids as champions of the west (the Greek
world) in an eastern context (Bevan 1902; BouchÂ e-Leclerq 1913±14; Meyer 1925).
After World War II the emphasis shifted, and Seleukid histor y came to be seen
increasingly as a continuation of the histor y of the ancient Near East, and in par ticular
the Persian empire (Kreissig 1978; Briant 1990; Kuhr t and Sher win-White 1991). It
goes without saying that modern writing on the Seleukids cannot all be categorized as
belonging solely to one or the other of these two approaches (Bikerman 1938 and
Rostovtzef f 1941: I.422±542, II.695±705, 841±70 are two illustrations). And it is
realistic to assume that perceptions will continue to evolve: the identity and orienta
tion of the Seleukids elude precise definition.
The view of the Seleukids as champions of Hellenism in the east receives only
equivocal suppor t in the ancient evidence. Plutarch's rhetoricalOn the For tune or the
Vir tue of Alexander, the star ting point of many a modern myth on this period, singles
out Alexander as (supposedly) the bringer of Greek civilization to the east and
contrasts him with the kings who came after, to their disadvantage (I 328c±329a; II
336f±337a, 338a±c, 341a). In his Lives Plutarch fails to rise to the bait of presenting
any of the Hellenistic kings, Seleukids or others, as champions of Hellenism: for the
most par t they were not even fit for biographical treatment. The Roman encounter
with Antiochos III added fur ther negative traits to the image of the r ulers. The
Roman commander Manlius Vulso is made to invoke environmental determinism
to denigrate the Ptolemies and Seleukids:
The Macedonians who hold Alexandria in Egypt, who dwell in Seleukeia and Babylonia
and in other colonies scattered throughout the world, have degenerated into Syrians,
Par thians, Egyptians. (Livy 38.17, in 189; cf. Livy 36.17 on Antiochos III)
Equally negative is the presentation of the Macedonian monarchies in Justin's Epit
ome of Pompeius Trogus: an underlying theme of his account is that of the decline of
the Macedonians after Alexander, through greed and internecine conflicts.
A dif ferent and positive slant on Seleukid histor y is given late in the day by Libanius
of Antioch, writing from a par tisan local perspective:
And so the men of that time . . . lived in happiness in the midst of barbarians, producing a
city (Antioch) which was a true Hellas and keeping their way of life pure in the midst of
so much corr uption all around them (§68) [. . .] (Seleukos I) planted so many cities on
the ear th that they were enough to bear the names of the cities of Macedonia and to be
named also for the members of his family [. . .] (§101) [. . .] You may go to Phoenicia and
see his cities there, and you may come here to Syria and see even more and greater ones
of his (§102). He extended this fair work as far as the Euphrates and the Tigris, and,
surrounding Babylon with cities, he planted them ever ywhere, even in Persia; in a word
he left bare no place that was suitable for receiving a city, but in his work of spreading
Hellenic civilisation he brought the barbarian world quite to an end (Lib. 11,Antiochicus
of A D 360, trans. G. Downey §103).
The Seleukids and Asia 127



This, it should be added, is dubious histor y: Libanius' fanciful presentation of the
Seleukids in this speech (11.69±131) says more about the Antiochenes' view of
themselves in the four th centur y A D than it does about the historical record of
Seleukid times.
The comparison of the Seleukids with the Persian empire suggested by more recent
research seems a fruitful approach. The Seleukid empire included many of the lands
and peoples that had once been under Persian rule, and shared with its predecessor
the same general problems of distance, communications, information and control.
Like the Achaimenids before, the Seleukids star ted by accepting the status quo and
tried to use it to their advantage. Their approach was `supra-national' in that the
status of subject communities was not determined by race or culture, and outward
respect was shown by the rulers for local traditions and cults: piety was a royal
attribute, though that did not prevent some kings from plundering temples when
in financial straits. Local elites were co-opted wherever possible: their suppor t was
essential in raising the tribute that was the foundation of the empire.
Yet all this arose from similarity of circumstances rather than deliberate imitation.
When Seleukid kings appealed to precedent to justify policy decisions, it is regularly
their own ancestors who are invoked (e.g. I Macc. 15.5), sometimes also previous
kings from Alexander onwards (e.g. OGIS 223; Austin 183: Er ythrai), but never the
Persian kings. Whereas Alexander's preoccupation with the Persians looms large in his
reign, there is a conspicuous absence of any mention of the Persians in texts emanat
ing from the Seleukids (the Ptolemies, by contrast, did make some use of anti-Persian
propaganda that was traditional in Egypt, cf. OGIS 54, 56). At Babylon Antiochos I,
going perhaps beyond the policy of his father Seleukos I (Scharrer 1999), presented
himself in the guise of a Babylonian king (Austin 189; Kuhr t and Sher win-White
1991). But no Seleukid ruler ever contemplated linking himself to the Persian past.
Other dynasties in the post-Alexander world did: the dynasty of Pontus, which
claimed a connection with the Achaimenid Persians, and the dynasty of Kommagene
in the first centur y B C , whose ruler Antiochos I deliberately mixed Persian, Greek and
Macedonian elements in his monuments on Mt Nemrud in a way no Seleukid ruler
would probably have dreamed of.
In reality the Macedonian origins of the Seleukids and their emergence in the post
Alexander context meant that though ruling an Asiatic empire they would have to
remain par t of the larger Greek world of the time, and par t of the `club' of royal
dynasties that dominated the age. The histor y of the near east was now much more
closely involved with the Greek world than previously. The Hellenistic kings were
seen as Greek rulers both by Greek writers (such as Polybios) and by a variety of
eastern sources. The Seleukid era was `the era of the Greeks' (IMacc. 1.10). A similar
view is found in Indian sources (Thapar 1997: 256, 273, 304). Babylonian sources
note the ambition of Seleukos I at the end of his career to attempt to return to
`Macedon, his native land', and this tallies with the presentation in the Greek sources
(Briant 1994a: 463±7). At Babylon Antiochos I, while presenting himself as Baby
lonian king, also makes a point of emphasizing his Macedonian origin (Austin 189;
Kuhr t and Sher win-White 1991: 76±7, 83). Fur thermore, the Macedonian conquest
was seen in Jewish sources as a violent event which ushered in a period of turbulence
(I Macc. 1.1±9). For the author of the Book of Daniel (11.2±29) the world was torn
128 Michel Austin



in a long struggle between the `King of the Nor th' (the Seleukids) and the `King of
the South' (the Ptolemies).
Membership of the wider Greek world had numerous consequences for the Seleu
kids. Culturally, they belonged to that world. The gods they impor ted to their empire
were of Greek origin: Apollo was the ancestor of the dynasty. Greek was the language
of cour t and communication with the rulers, none of whom is known to have used
any other language. The coinage of the Seleukids, as that of the other Hellenistic
dynasties, was purely Greek in its style, iconography and legends, and with ver y few
exceptions made no concessions to the eastern context in which they operated (Zahle
1990). There was a Seleukid mint at Babylon, but issues from it carried no reference
to Babylon or to Babylonian cults.
The question of manpower is crucial. As a band of immigrants into the eastern
world the rulers needed to build up the human basis of their suppor t. Sketchy as is the
evidence, it suggests that the backbone of the new Seleukid foundations was drawn
from the Greek world (Briant 1982: 227±79). The settlers of Antioch, for example,
came from Antigonos' foundation of Antigoneia on the Orontes and included
Athenians and Macedonians (Grainger 1990b: 95, 152). Antioch in Persis received
a contingent of colonists from Magnesia on the Maeander (OGIS 233; Austin 190).
Less clear-cut is the recruitment of the Seleukids' militar y forces. Large-scale con
scription was used by them from their subject peoples, as had been the practice of
previous eastern empires. The roll-call of the Seleukid army in major campaigns shows
extensive recruitment by the kings of peoples from Asia, as can be seen from the battle
of Raphia in 217 (Polyb. 5.79), or the battle of Magnesia in 189 (Livy 37.40±1).
But impor tant uncer tainties remain. There is no agreement whether the core of
the Seleukid army, the heavy cavalr y and the phalanx, were of predominantly
Macedonian/Greek origin, or included large numbers of eastern soldiers trained in
a Macedonian style of fighting (Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 53±7, 214; against,
Bar-Kochva 1989: 90±115). There is also a striking dear th of evidence to demon
strate the militar y use of peoples from the core of the empire, Babylonians and
Syrians: it is not clear whether this reflects a deliberate policy on the par t of the rulers
to exclude them from any militar y function (Walbank 1988: 110±12).
More decisive is the evidence for the origins of the closest followers of the kings ±
those who belonged to the select circle of `friends' who shared the king's life and acted
as his advisors, governors and commanders. These are the men prominent, for
example, in Polybios' account of the early years of Antiochos III, and they were in
practice the governing class of the Seleukid empire. Despite suggestions to the contrar y
and continued controversy, all the available evidence indicates that they were over
whelmingly from the Greek world (Habicht 1958, though with questionable figures;
Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 121±4; Savalli-Lestrade 1998: 216±34). This is
hardly surprising: to share in the king's life on a daily basis fluency in Greek was in
practice a prerequisite. It is only at the lower levels of administration and government,
and at the local level, that non-Greeks are likely to be found more frequently.
In practice the western par t of the Seleukid empire exer ted a constant pull on the
rulers, from the reign of the founder onwards. After years of activity in Babylonia,
Iran and the far east, then in Nor th Syria, Seleukos I turned his attention at the end of
his reign to western Asia Minor which he conquered from L ysimachos. He then
The Seleukids and Asia 129



crossed into Thrace, and both Greek and Babylonian sources repor t his intention to
return to his native Macedon (above). All his successors down to Antiochos III
devoted considerable time and ef for t to af fairs in Asia Minor. Seleukid involvement
and rivalr y with the Ptolemies is also a thread that runs continuously through almost
the whole of their histor y. The rivalr y was not limited to conflicts over the possession
of Koile Syria, as the conventional listing of `Syrian Wars' between the two dynasties
misleadingly suggests, but extended to the whole of the western par t of the Seleukid
empire, including the control of the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean, in which the
Ptolemies held the advantage.
Membership of the wider Greek world did not necessarily carr y with it any cultural
`mission' on the par t of the rulers. In one par ticular field, that of the promotion of
Greek intellectual and literar y activity, which both Ptolemies and Attalids took
seriously as a manifestation of royal power and status (Erskine 1995), the Seleukid
record is much slighter than that of their rivals. After a tentative beginning under the
first two rulers the momentum seemed to flag, and no Seleukid city achieved the
cultural eminence of Alexandria under the Ptolemies (Austin 2001). More generally,
it may be doubted whether the rulers had any policy of `hellenizing' their empire.
Their foundation of Greek-style cities, reliance on immigrant colonists and soldiers
from the Greek world, and recruitment of a circle of followers of predominantly
Greek extraction all ser ved primarily imperial purposes. The intention was not to
supersede the cultural and ethnic diversity of their empire which the rulers seem from
their actions to have taken for granted.
Any `hellenization' that did take place, in the Seleukid empire or elsewhere, usually
resulted not from royal policy and initiatives but from the wish of individual non
Greeks to adopt features of the Greek life-style which, for a variety of possible reasons,
they found attractive or useful (Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 141±9, 186±7). This
is clearly attested among the Jews of Palestine in the second centur y: the Jewish
evidence, for all its hostility to the Seleukid rulers, makes abundantly clear that the
moves towards `self-hellenization' were all initiated within Jewish circles. They did not
depend on any preconceived royal policy, though it was assumed that the Seleukid ruler
would give them his blessing (I Macc. 1.11±15, II Macc. 4.7±17). The Jewish sources
also make clear that after the conquest by Antiochos III Seleukid power was tacitly
accepted by rival Jewish leaders who competed for royal suppor t (II Macc. 3.1±13,
4.1±6 etc.). The attempt of Antiochos IV to ban Jewish customs in 167 came late in the
day: despite extensive modern debate it remains notoriously obscure in its scope,
purpose and motives, and in any case it was soon rescinded (Gruen, this volume).
Babylonia shares with the Jews of Palestine the benefit of local source material of
non-Greek origin: both are known chiefly from indigenous evidence rather than
classical sources, which are sketchy in comparison. Babylonia holds a special place in
the Seleukid empire, as the star ting point of Seleukid rule and a wealthy and populous
province at the hear t of the empire's communications between east and west. Both
classical and Babylonian sources give some indication of the ef for ts of the rulers to
secure their rule through conciliation of the local elites and outward respect for
Babylonian traditions, which involved the per formance of royal ritual and the main
tenance of temples (Diod. 19.90±2 for Seleukos I; Kuhr t and Sher win-White 1991
and Scharrer 1999: 127±8 for Antiochos I; generally Kuhr t and Sher win-White 1987,
chs. 1±3 and Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 149±61; Kuhr t 1996). Yet at the same
130 Michel Austin



time they sought to place their own stamp on the region. The significance of the
foundation of Seleukeia on the Tigris by Seleukos is debated (the exact date in the
reign of Seleukos I is uncer tain), though the available sources give an ambivalent
impression. Greek sources suggest it was intended as a counterpoise to Babylon, and
feared as such by the Babylonian priesthood (App. Syr. 58). A large and power ful city,
Seleukeia on the Tigris was no ordinar y foundation, but was treated by the Seleukids
as one of their `capitals', while Babylon was not (Invernizzi 1994). Babylonian
sources refer to Seleukeia as the `royal city' and classical sources allege that the
Seleukids deliberately favoured Seleukeia at Babylon's expense (Strabo 16.1.5; Pliny
HN 6.122). Babylon had a garrison and a Greek population (the remains of a Greek
theatre have been found), but no attempt was made by the rulers to turn it into a
Greek city. Uruk, on its side, shows ver y little evidence of any Greek presence, though
two local dignitaries are known to have assumed a Greek name in addition to their
original Babylonian one: Anu-uballit, governor of Uruk under Antiochos II, had
received the name Nikarchos from Antiochos I and under Antiochos III another Anu
uballit called Kephalon founded a temple to Anu in honour of the Seleukid king
(Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 150±1, 158±9).
5 Conclusion
It has been debated whether the Seleukid empire should be characterized as `strong'
or `weak' (Kuhr t and Sher win-White 1987: 2±3; Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993:
7±8; cf. Ma 1999: 174±8 for a complex view). But the two terms are perhaps not in
practice mutually exclusive: both may be appropriate, depending on the context and
the point of view. It may also be suggested that a distinction always needs to be drawn
between absoluteness of royal power in theor y, and ef fective power in practice.
The Seleukid dynasty was cer tainly remarkable for its longevity. Rival monarchies
did spring up in the course of Seleukid histor y, but on the edges of the empire and not
in its central par ts ± the Attalids of Pergamon in Asia Minor, and the rulers of Baktria
in the far east. Attempted usurpations came to grief and had no lasting ef fect, as shown
by the fate of Molon, satrap of Media in 222±220, that of Achaios in Asia Minor in
220±213, or by the bid for power of Diodotos Tr yphon in c. 145±139/8. After
Tr yphon there were no more `usurpers' in Seleukid histor y: conflicts for power were
within the dynasty itself. Territorially the empire endured despite numerous ups and
downs. Even after the ef fective loss of control of the far east and the loss of Asia Minor
after the peace of Apameia (188) it was still large, rich and powerful. Its decline has
often been dated too early: it was not until the defeat and death of Antiochos VII in
battle with the Par thians in 130±129 that the loss of Babylonia and western Iran
became permanent. Even in its final period of decay, when an increased number of
rivals competed for an ever decreasing empire in Nor th Syria, it was dif ficult to remove
the dynasty: it took the inter vention by Tigranes of Armenia to replace Seleukid rule
from 83 to 69, and the Romans to terminate the Seleukid dynasty once and for all in
63. One obvious element of strength for the rulers was the fragmentation of the
empire, which lacked collective institutions and thus any possibility of concer ted
action on the par t of the subjects. When Antiochos III sought to re-establish Seleukid
control over Asia Minor in 197/6, only Smyrna and Lampsakos resisted him, but
individually and without any local suppor t: they looked to distant Rome for assistance.
The Seleukids and Asia 131



On the other hand the Seleukid empire had all the limitations of monarchical
empires. The risks inherent in dynastic struggles could never be eliminated, as shown
by the conflict of the two rival brothers Seleukos II and Antiochos Hierax, the rivalr y
between the descendants of the two brothers Seleukos IV and Antiochos IV, and the
proliferation of rival and shor t-lived rulers in the final decades of the dynasty. The size
of the empire created obvious problems for the rulers: `We would do well to see all
ancient kingdoms and empires as no more than changing patchworks of control'
(Millar 1984b: 18). The argument that the Seleukids were overstretched is easily
made and dif ficult to refute (cf. e.g. Will 1979: 262±3, 272±5; Heinen 1984: 421±2).
It is a tenable view that the western preoccupations of the rulers had a par t to play in
their loss of control in the far east: the evidence of coinage strongly suggests that
Diodotos the satrap of Baktria broke away from the Seleukids and proclaimed himself
king in the reign of Antiochos II (Topoi 4.2, 1994: 436±42, 474±507, 513±19; Holt
1999; Lerner 1999). It is by no means cer tain that the eastern `anabasis' of Antiochos
III from 212±205, designed to restore control, did achieve its objectives: this was the
last Seleukid incursion into this par t of the empire and hencefor ward it went its own
way without regard to the Seleukid rulers.
Nor is this merely a modern analysis after the event: the contradictor y pulls at the
hear t of Seleukid policy are openly revealed in Polybios' account of the debates at the
cour t of Antiochos III in the years after his accession. Yet the Seleukid kings were
always reluctant to give up formally anything that had once belonged to the dynasty.
In 196 at L ysimacheia Antiochos III lectured the Romans in all seriousness on his
claim to the Thracian Chersonese: Seleukos had defeated L ysimachos in battle and his
kingdom thus belonged to the Seleukid dynasty (Polyb. 18.51). After the Peace of
Apameia the same Antiochos III is repor ted to have thanked the Romans for provid
ing him with a more manageable empire (Val. Max. 4,1 ext.9). This shows at least that
the king had a sense of humour: he and his predecessors had devoted enormous time
and energy to securing control of Asia Minor against their rivals (Ma 1999).
One dif ficulty in any assessment of the Seleukids is the disappearance of reputable
historical writing on them in antiquity, if any ever existed. Only a few rulers stand out
more conspicuously in the sur viving tradition, notably Seleukos I, Antiochos III and
Antiochos IV. Of these only Seleukos I secured a lasting reputation as the founder of
an empire and an undefeated conqueror. `In my view it is beyond dispute that
Seleukos was the greatest king of those who succeeded Alexander, of the most royal
mind, and ruling over the greatest territor y, next to Alexander himself ' (Arr.Anab.
7.22.5). Antiochos III had the misfor tune of facing the Romans and being defeated
by them: this obscured the achievements of the earlier par t of his reign, as may be seen
in Livy's unbalanced account (Books 33±38). Antiochos IV on his side had the
misfor tune of being pilloried by the Jewish tradition as a persecutor. From a Roman
perspective the dynasty as a whole had failed like others to stand up to the challenge of
Rome: not surprisingly references to the Seleukids are scanty in Roman literature. It
was only in Nor th Syria that Seleukid memories were kept alive and adapted to ser ve
contemporar y local purposes, as may be seen in Libanius in the four th centur yA D and
in an even more garbled form in the sixth centur y A D in the Chronicle of John Malalas
of Antioch (Book VIII). Any estimate of the Seleukids is thus provisional. Modern
views have shifted in step with changing perceptions of the `Hellenistic world'. No
consensus has emerged and the debate can be expected to continue.

A NOTE ON SOURCES
The pover ty of the available evidence for the Seleukid empire is a per manent draw
back. No proper account of the dynasty's histor y has sur vived. The nearest to a
continuous nar rative of the `Hellenistic period' is Justin's mediocre and rhetorical
Epitome of the Philippic Histories of Pompeius Trogus. The only available outline of
Seleukid histor y is a sketchy summar y in Appian's Syrian Histor y 45±70. Neither
writer gives the slightest indication of what contemporar y sources ultimately lay
behind their material. Other literar y evidence is ver y scattered ± Diodoros, Livy,
Plutarch, Polybios, Strabo and others. Coins, archaeological evidence and above all
inscriptions contribute impor tant sidelights. In general the source material is charac
terized by its randomness, its unevenness in time and space (infor mation becomes
increasingly sparse the fur ther east one looks), the Greek slant of the evidence (the
vast majority of inscriptions come from the Greek world, and above all from wester n
Asia Minor), and the lack of infor mation about the personalities of the r ulers them
selves and of their followers. The availability of non-Greek material provides a par tial
compensation, notably Jewish literature concer ning their relations with the Seleukids
in the second centur y, and Babylonian documentar y evidence: both provide a dif fer
ent perspective on the Seleukids and illuminate aspects largely neglected by the Greek
evidence (see fur ther Erskine, this volum e). But in general any moder n recons tr uc
tion of Seleukid histor y is no more than an unreliable patchwork, and arguments from
silence are wor thless: caveat lector.
FURTHER READING
On the present state of Seleukid studies cf. Briant 1990 and the ar ticles in Brodersen
1999. A good star ting point for the post-war re-evaluation of the Seleukids is Kuhr t
and Sher win-White 1987 and Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993, who argue that
Seleukid histor y should be seen from a near-easter n perspective and as a continuation
of the Persian empire, with its centre in Babylonia. The approach underplays the
Seleukids' wester n connections and should be read in conjunction with the ar ticles in
Topoi 4: 1994. Ma 1999 is a richly documented and searching study which gives a
wider perspective on Seleukid histor y than its title implies. Bikerman 1938 retains
much of value despite its age. The prosopographical compilation of Grainger 1997,
though useful, is unsystematic and leaves gaps. For the dynastic relations of the
Seleukids there are contrasting approac hes by Seiber t 1967 ch. 3 and Ogden 1999
ch. 5. On the Seleukid personnel of gover nment see Savalli-Lestrade 1998: 3±122,

1 On the Eve of the Gauls: a Political Topography of the
Southern Balkans
The third -centur y Bal kans of fer an oppor tuni ty not only to follow the developm ent
of pol itical event s b ut a lso the changing charact er of Greek pol itical orga nization.
This chapter takes as its focal point the polit ical trav ails of Mace donia, especi ally the
Antigon id regim e and its attem pts to cont rol the behav iour of variou s imme diate
neighbo urs. The final failure of the indepe ndent city-state s of the Greek main land,
par ticularly Athens and Spar ta, as ef fect ive points of resistance to Mace donian
hegemony emerges as a maj or the me, as does the increasin g success of regional
states/governments ( sympoliteiai/koina) in this same capacity . The Aitolian and
Achaian common wealt hs dominat e the latter discussion.
If we were to transpor t a par ty of State For mation theorist s to this region in early
280 (just a head of an only sligh tly less fractious group of Celts) the y prob ably would
share at least one fu ndament al obser vat ion: the fa r ther south the y venture d, the more
sophisti cated and compl ex the pol itical insti tutions of the human commun ities that
they encou ntered. As seeker s af ter the tr uth about how it is that hum ans for m `states' ,
they would also note, howeve r, that wherev er they wand ered across the so uther n
Balkans of the third , and indeed the fo ur th, centur y , they came across peoples
str uggl ing with (or aga inst) the proc ess of creat ing regional identitie s and gover n
menta l insti tutions (Cabane s 1993a).
Far the st nor th and we st they would find C elts and Illyr ians in the earliest stages of
this process. T he fundam ental so cio-econo mic buildi ng block of these peoples was
similar to that of their more southerly neighbo urs: an extende d family of far me rs/
stockb reeders gathe red with close neighbo u rs into villag es (Halstead 1987). The
latter supplem ented their liveliho od by trading with and raiding aga inst n eighbou ring
commun ities; and these families/ settle ments identified and c o-operat ed with othe rs
in both immediat e and more remote proxim ity to for m ever larg er, albei t ever more
fragile, pol itical commun ities. Two Illy rian coalitions achie ved a meas ure of stabilit y ,
and so regional impor tance: the Ard iaioi along the Adr iatic coas t between Skodra and



the river Neretva; and the Dardanians who inhabited, roughly, modern Kosovo
(Hammond 1966; Cabanes 1988; 1993a).
Thracian speakers to the east and south had forged more durable regional coali
tions. Those inhabiting the Danubian foothills of the Star Planina range (anc.
Haemos) that divides modern Bulgaria had come together as the power ful Triballi.
Between the Haemos and Rhodope ranges, stretching east from the headwaters of
the Hebros river to the Black Sea coast, an `Odr ysian' state had emerged, governed
from the urbanized settlement of Seuthopolis (Archibald 1998). Further south and
east, in European Turkey, were additional, although less stable, Thracian coalitions
(Papazoglou 1978; Hoddinott 1981).
The regional state formation trend would be clearest, for our itinerant theorists,
among the southernmost, Greek-speaking peoples of the Balkans. Here, the funda
mental socio-economic unit, the extended family and its dependents (Gk: oikos/pl.
oikoi), had long since become the building block of ever larger, and increasingly
formalized local and district groups such as the clan (genos) and the tribe (phyle). And
while settlement patterns for most remained rooted in the village (kome) and their
livelihood tied to agriculture, stockbreeding and its close derivatives, local settlement
and status hierarchies also arose early on.
In the lands furthest south, cer tain of these populations had achieved a degree of
nucleation, and often even of urbanization, to establish what our experts would
identify as `central places' controlling and exploiting surrounding `hinterlands'. The
Greeks called this consolidation of a territor y (chora) around a central site (astu)
synoikismos, that is to say `the coming together of oikoi' and their dependents. This
was often achieved by means of a cult or sanctuar y at the central site frequented by the
residents of the chora. The result was that most familiar of Mediterranean state forms:
the independent city-state (Snodgrass 1980; 1993).
Greeks, however, dubbed their version a polis, and distinguished it from those of
neighbouring peoples by its extension of formalized responsibilities and rights,
particularly in the area of self-governance, to a relatively broader segment of its
population, typically to adult males who possessed a certain level of wealth. Contem
porar y classical scholarship recognizes this distinction by designating the polis not
simply as a city-state, but rather as a `citizen-state' (M. Hansen 1993).
Yet not all, and perhaps not even most, mainland Greek speakers of the early third
centur y B C resided in villages that were par t of a polis. Nor th of an imaginar y line
stretching from the Gulf of Corinth to the pass at Thermopylai, any additional level of
identity and loyalty beyond family, clan and tribe came more commonly in the form of
the ethnos (`people' or `nation'; pl. ethne Ã). Although focused, as the polis was, around
a common cult/sanctuar y and, again like the polis, bolstered by a unifying body of
kinship myth, an ethnos was physically much more extensive than a typical polis. For
that reason it was both potentially much more power ful and in practice much less
internally cohesive than a polis, except when threatened from outside (Hall 1997).
Nonetheless, the ethnos does appear early on as the fundamental unit in even
greater entities, such as the Amphiktyoniai (`dwellers round about') that form in
the late Archaic era to regulate regional sanctuaries of growing panhellenic import
ance, such as those of Demeter at Anthela, Apollo at Delphi, Poseidon at Kalauria,
and Zeus at Olympia or Dodona (Tausend 1992). Some ethne Ã, in par ticular that of
the Thessalians, were prominent political actors in this earlier period. Indeed, even

citizens of the independent poleis eventually came to see themselves as members of
some ethnos. Par ticularly during the four th centur y, many of these ethne Ã attempted to
bridge the gap between the local and the regional by developing stronger, federal
political institutions, based upon a var ying mix of direct democracy and propor tional
representation (Larsen 1968: 173±302; Beck 1997).
Yet a tension always remained between regional and local identity, interests and
loyalty, even in areas where local settlements had not coalesced into poleis (Cabanes
1985). Whether these regional polities could be transfor med into stable regional
states capable of routinely marshalling their resources for common purposes, in
par ticular for war, was a question which had animated the histor y of the southern
Balkans for the preceding centur y (Cabanes 1989; 1993a). It would continue to
underpin events and developments in the area between 280 and 221.
2 The Arrival of the `Others'
The seminal event for this area and era occurred at the outset. In the late 280s and
early 270s a series of Celtic war par ties arrived on the scene. The movement of these
`Gauls' into the southern Balkans set of f shock waves that reverberated into the
far thest corners of the Hellenistic world. In summer 280 separate bands approached
via each of the three major routes into the southern Balkans from the Danube bend
(Paus. 10.19.4±7; cf. Hammond 1982: 619±24; GaraÈ o anin 1982: 75±8).
The population they encountered comprised the most power ful and institutionally
stable Hellenic regional state of the day: the ethnos of the Macedonians. It had not
always been so, of course. Local interests, par ticularly those of the populations of
highland districts in the Pindos foothills ± Pelagonia, L ynkos, Eordaia, and far ther
out, along the upper Haliakmon, Orestis, Tymphaia, and Elimeia ± long resisted
attempts by clans of the fer tile plain between the Haliakmon and Axios, under the
leadership of the Argead clan based at Aigai, to forge a more per fect union. The
lowlanders' ef for ts were both helped and hindered by external pressures. One source
was in the nor th and west. Regular incursions by Illyrian neighbours allowed
Argead leaders to foster Macedonian identity and their own legitimacy. That is, if
the Argead in question sur vived the campaign. Those that did still had to face trouble
from the opposite quar ter. Macedonia's Aigaian coastline was dotted with poleis
whose leaders constantly resisted the Argeads' state-building activities (and fomented
fur ther resistance among the Macedonian elite). The metropoleis fur ther south that
had dispatched these colonies played the same game (Hammond and Grif fith 1979;
Borza 1990; Errington 1990; Hatzopoulos 1996).
Philip II's ability to transfor m Pella into the focal point of a monarchic state
commanding the allegiance of all the various Macedonians, and to use the region's
abundant resources to cr ush its various antagonists ± Illyrian, Thracian and Hellenic ±
is a tribute, of course, to his own talents (Borza 1990: 198±230). The subsequent
militar y achievements of Alexander and his various marshals likewise reflect the genius
of their authors. But all also reflect the latent power of a unified Greek ethnos, albeit
the most populous among them. And none could have happened without the ef for ts
of earlier Argeads, who built first Aigai and then Pella, and nur tured regional identity
and solidarity via common institutions, such as the cult and sanctuar y of Zeus at
Dion, in the shadow of Mount Olympos (Borza 1990: 167, 172±4). For tunately for
Macedon and the Mainland 137



the Celts approaching from the west, their own timing was impeccable. In 280 the
Macedonian ethnos remained a stable and potentially powerful monarchic state
(Billows 1995: 183±220). In preceding years, for example, it had continued to
suppress any re-emergence of central authority among the Dardanians, thus, ironic
ally, clearing the way for the Gauls.
Of late, however, the kingship of the Macedonians had been the object of conten
tion between several post-Argead pretenders. The current ruler was a newcomer to
the scene: Ptolemy Keraunos, a disinherited son of Ptolemy I of Egypt. Keraunos had
only gained the kingship within the previous year, and then through the murder of his
erstwhile patron Seleukos I, in the aftermath of the battle of Koroupedion. Eager to
establish his legitimacy, Keraunos declined an of fer of alliance and assistance from the
Dardanians, and refused to bribe the Gallic intruders into a change of course.
Confronting them with only a scratch force, he met defeat and death. As Celts
paraded his head on the point of a spear, the Macedonian army evaporated, leaving
the Gauls to run amok among Macedonia's communities and cantons.
That they were able to do so, and for an extended period, was a further conse
quence of the troubles that had immediately preceded their arrival. When the Gauls
severed Keraunos' connection to his cranium, they also metaphorically decapitated
the ethnos of the Macedonians. Local communities and their institutions, no doubt,
continued to function, and district/cantonal ties and government probably did as
well. But the Macedonians as an ethnos did not. Between the internecine bloodletting
of the 280s, and the handiwork of Celtic broadswords, the leadership cadre that had
been the key element of the Macedonian state temporarily disintegrated (Borza 1990:
230±52; Errington 1990: 5). Successive pretenders to the throne were unable to rally
the ethnos. Enough gathered under the leadership of a certain Sosthenes to expel the
initial invaders, but Sosthenes' forces were soon brushed aside by yet another Gallic
coalition that arrived in the late summer via the third route (the Vardar/Axios
corridor) bent on pushing fur ther south (Euseb. Chron. 1.235; Diod. 22.4; Just.
24.6.1±2; Hammond and Walbank 1988: 253±4). At least two individuals, Pyrrhos
and Antigonos Gonatas, may have possessed the combination of prestige and ability
needed to bring order to Macedonia. But, having lost out in the earlier struggles,
both were preoccupied and far from the scene. The absence of Pyrrhos was par ticu
larly unfortunate for the Macedonians. A charismatic militar y leader, he had already
ruled them for at least a brief period, despite the fact that by bir th he was a member of
the Aiakid clan that led another ethnos: the Molossians. In the recent past Pyrrhos'
origins had worked against his attempts to asser t authority among the Macedonians.
In this instance they may well have helped, for Pyrrhos now would have brought the
Molossians into the fray on behalf of the Macedonians.
Molossis lay south and west of the Lakes District in the Pindos mountains. The
hear t of this region was the highland plain of Lake Ioannina that links two central
places ± Passaron, the region's political seat, with its cult of Zeus Areios, and the pan
hellenic sanctuar y of Zeus at Dodona, with its oracle. The peoples and settlements of
Molossis had formalized their identity through the adoption of regional governmen
tal institutions that may have been even more complex than those of the Macedonians
(Cabanes 1993a). Their Aiakid `king' led the ethnos in war and cult. But alongside
him the Molossians collectively elected an annual board of of ficials to deal with
daily and internal af fairs, assisted by a council of representatives from Molossis'
138 Joseph B. Scholten



various districts. And king and people swore a mutual oath to respect the rules of
governance established by custom (Plut. Pyrrh. 5; Hammond 1967: 487±524).
This Molossian government (koinon: Hammond 1967: 528), in turn, had under its
control the Ionic coastal districts of Elinia and Kassopia, between the Thyamis river
delta and the later site of Nikopolis on the Ambrakian Gulf. Pyrrhos had also gained
control of the power ful polis east of Kassopia that gave that Gulf its name, transform
ing the eponymous central place of that one-time Corinthian colony (mod. Ar ta) into
his answer to Pella. At the same time Pyrrhos had managed to pr y the peoples of
Parauaia and Tymphaia, which lay between Molossis and the upland cantons of
western Macedonia, out of the orbit of the ethnos to their east (Hammond 1967:
525±54). Fur thermore, as `king' of the Molossians Pyrrhos was also `general' of an
even larger regional entity: the `alliance of the mainlanders' (symmachia of the
Epeirotes). Two other tribal groups to the west had co-operated in the creation of
this alliance, if only to check the further westward expansion of the Molossian state.
The Chaonians' lands began south and just inland of the colonial polis Apollonia on
the Adriatic, straddling the Aous river valley and the plain of Phoinike in southern
Albania. Their neighbours, the Thesproti, controlled the succeeding mountains,
along with the por tions of the Thyamis and Acheron river valleys inland of Elinia
and Kassopia (Hammond 1967: 557±94).
While the precise degree of Pyrrhos' control over this Epeirote alliance remains
unclear, when he did manage to rally it to the side of his own Molossian state, the
combination could be a match for whatever resources the current ruler of the Mace
donians could muster. Presumably the Gallic incursions of 280 would have offered
incentive for Epeirote unity, and there seems little reason to doubt that the defeated
Macedonians would have rallied around Pyrrhos, recent antagonisms notwithstand
ing. In the current circumstances, it seems clear whom the Macedonians would have
viewed as `us' and whom as `them'.
But Pyrrhos was away, and so the Gauls did play. After some additional, leisurely
months of pillaging the communities of the Macedonian lowlands, the fourth wave
headed south around Mount Olympos and into the second largest plain (after central
Macedonia) of the Greek-speaking southlands: that of Thessaly (Diod. 22.9; Paus.
10.19.12; Just. 24.6.2±4).
Bounded on the south by the low Othr ys range, the west by the Pindos, and the
east by Ossa-Pelion, Thessaly was both watered and united by the river Peneios and
its tributaries. This watershed also made the plain ideal for agriculture, which in turn
produced a large population. As noted above, the various communities of the plain
developed a common identity, and ef fective regional governance, at a remarkably
early date. Local clans and settlements coalesced into four regional polities, the
`tetrads' of Hestiaiotis in the nor thwest, Pelasgiotis in the nor theast, Phthiotis in
the southeast, and Thessaliotis in the southwest. The common sanctuar y of theethnos
was that of Athena Itonia, in Thessaliotis. In addition to leaders for each of these
regions (`tetrarchs'), the Thessalians also chose a common leader (archon ) whose
primar y duties seem to have been militar y and cultic (Helly 1995). As time passed,
however, the early unity of the Thessalians, which was reflected in their place of
honour at the head of the various ethne Ã of the Delphic±Anthelic Amphiktyonia that
controlled the sanctuar y at Delphi, gradually dissipated in the face of internal rivalries.
As in the lands further south, cer tain settlements among the Thessalian tetrads began
Macedon and the Mainland 139



to dominate their neighbours and adopt the institutions and behaviours of independ
ent citizen-states. At sites such as Larisa, Pherai and Pharsalos, clans such as the
Aleuadai asser ted control over surrounding territories, often reducing par t of the
nearby population to a dependent status (the penestai: Ducat 1994). As these poleis
grew in size and complexity, so did the rivalr y between them within the ethnos. As a
consequence, for long stretches the archonship went unfilled. When some individual
did achieve the status to assume it, as Jason and Alexander of Pherai did in the 370s
and 360s, internal opposition, whether local or regional, soon sur faced to thwar t
(i.e., eliminate) him. Fear ful neighbours were only too happy to encourage such
Thessalian fratricide (Larsen 1968: 12±26).
It took an outsider to reunite the Thessalians. Rather than face the prospect of the
rise of another Jason to threaten all he had accomplished in Macedonia, Philip II
decided to impose order in Thessaly, and then assumed the archonship himself. He
thereby not only stabilized his own hold on power in the nor th, but also added
greatly to his ability to control the af fairs of the southern Greeks. As archon of
Thessaly, Philip could command quick access to central and western Greece, and
add the considerable manpower of Thessaly to the even greater pool he had in
Macedonia. His son continued this custom, and the Thessalian cavalr y played a key
role in Alexander's conquest of the Achaimenid empire (Westlake 1935; Sordi 1958).
All successful rulers of Macedon after Alexander followed this lead with regard to
Thessaly. Demetrios Poliorketes went so far as to place an eponymous stronghold,
Demetrias, on the Gulf of Pagasai. It ser ved as his capital, linking his Macedonian
holdings to those in the south. Demetrios' successors maintained Demetrias, because
of its easy access to Pelasgiotis and Phthiotis, as one of the key links in a chain of bases
from which they projected their power throughout the southern mainland, the
infamous `fetters of Greece' (Polyb. 18.11.5; Walbank 1967: 563; Errington 1990:
151, 155, 162).
Their care was clearly born of experience. Any weakening in the stability of the
Macedonian state invariably tipped the balance in Thessaly between those who
suppor ted (and were suppor ted by) Philip's arrangement, and those who opposed
it. The Thessalian cavalr y that earlier had fought alongside Alexander turned and
fought against his regent, Antipater, during the Lamian War that broke out upon
news of Alexander's death. Keraunos' demise seems to have had a similar liberating
ef fect. When the Gauls were finally ejected from Greece, a Thessalian delegation
reappears at the head of the list of par ticipants at the next meeting of the Delphic±
Anthelic Amphiktyonia. When the Macedonian king was their archon, the Thessalian
delegation yielded this position to his personal delegation (LefÁe vre 1998a).
At the time of the Gauls' arrival in their lands, however, the communities of
Thessaly seem to have been more concerned with pragmatic matters. Most appear
to have presented a matador's defence, waving the invaders on towards the south
(Paus. 10.19.12). Some may even have joined the newcomers' excursion (Just.
24.7.2), an early example of the contingency of Celtic otherness in the eyes of the
Hellenistic world (cf. Mitchell, this volume).
As this swelling band descended into the plain south of Mt. Othr ys inhabited by
the small ethnos of the Malians and commanded by their central site, Lamia,
the invaders finally found their way blocked. An immediate hurdle was the river
Spercheios, which emptied into the sea not far to the east (BÂe quignon 1937). Just

beyond it, another mountain barrier loomed: the Oita-Knemis range. Two routes
crossed it most directly: one, the Duo Vouna pass west of Mt. Knemis (mod.
Kallidromos) and east of Mt. Oita, past the polis Herakleia Trachis; the other, the
more usual and famous pass of Thermopylai between the Malian Gulf and the nor th
face of Knemis/Kallidromos (Pritchett 1985: 190±216; 1989: 118±22). Both routes,
however, were guarded by a combined force of at least 26,000 infantr y and 1500
cavalr y, drawn from the polities of central and southern Greece (Paus. 10.20.3±5).
Many of the states contributing to this blocking force were familiar players in Greek
politics: the small ethnos of the east Lokrians, on whose western border Thermopylai
lay; that of the Phokians, west and south of the Lokrians; that of the Boiotians,
beyond Phokis, and presumably led by its dominant member state, the polis of
Thebes; the great polis of Athens, and its smaller neighbour and rival Megara. Not
coincidentally, these polities lay along the normal overland route between Thermo
pylai and the Isthmus of Corinth. All, however, were also members of the council of
the old Delphic±Anthelic Amphiktyonia. This organization had ser ved as a rallying
point for common resistance to threats to central Greece often in the past, and so may
also have done so on this occasion.
Equally likely as organizer of this coalition, however, is also its most unlikely
member. Pausanias tells us that the largest contingent among the Greek forces
along the Thermopylai±Herakleia front was supplied by another ethnos: that of the
Aitolians. This polity was an outgrowth of an older cultic community centred on the
sanctuar y of Apollo at Thermon, at the east end of Lake Trichonis (Antonetti 1990a).
East and nor th of the Trichonis basin, including the central course of the Acheloos
river, Aitolians also dwelt in the mountainous regions drained by the rivers Evenos,
Mornos and Karpenesiotis, and their tributaries. Settlements in this rugged region
were numerous, and in its latest, most complex form the Aitolian state referred to its
fundamental constituent units as `poleis' (Funke 1985; Bommelje et al. 1987). With
the possible exception of Kallion in the east, however, none achieved the degree
of complexity modern scholars tend to associate with the term polis. Most poleis of
Aitolia proper remained of the rudimentar y kind: looser, canton-like collections
of scattered villages (cf. Funke 1997).
Outsiders recognized the existence of an Aitolian ethnos by the outbreak of the
great Peloponnesian Wars of the later fifth centur y. The subsequent, negative image
of Aitolians as semi-feral brigands whose Hellenism was in doubt dates from this
period, promoted by Athenian writers upset at the Aitolians' slaughter of an Athen
ian-led incursion up the Mornos valley in 426 (Antonetti 1990b: 43±143). Yet these
same writers' claim that the Aitolians and their neighbours clung to an antiquated,
more Homeric set of interpersonal conventions and social structures cannot be totally
dismissed, as it squares with the limited archaeological data currently at our disposal.
Such conditions would also explain the Aitolian inability to rally for common
actions other than self-defence. Across the four th centur y the base of the triangle
shaped lands of the Aitolian ethnos edged southward, to the nor th coast of the Gulf of
Corinth between the mouth of the Acheloos in the west and Tol(o)phon in the east.
During the same years Aitolians developed their common political structures enough
that their government, termed the `koinon of the Aitolians' (Tod 2.137), was deemed
wor thy of study by Greek political philosophers (Arist. frag. 473 Rose). Yet these
coastal districts, Aiolis, the Naupaktia and the lands of the small ethnos of the West
Macedon and the Mainland 141



(Ozolian) Lokrians, did not come under Aitolian control through communal action
by their ethnos
/
koinon
, but rather through the good of fices of power ful third par ties,
such as the Boiotian koinon
during the Theban hegemony, or the Macedonians under
Philip. The direct threat of Macedonian imperialism prompted increasing Aitolian
involvement in regional af fairs, par ticularly in the early stages of the Lamian/Hellenic
war. But the Aitolians quit that contest half way through, and were feckless allies to
various of the Diadochoi, par ticularly the Antigonids (Scholten 2000: 13±19; cf.
Grainger 1999: 54±86).
Only at the outset of the third centur y did the Aitolians as a polity begin to play a
regular, active role in the af fairs of mainland Greece. Their most impor tant act was
assuming control over the Parnassos massif, probably as a buf fer for communities
of eastern Aitolia. As the new territories included Delphi, however, the Aitolians'
move earned them only fur ther grief. In 289 the Antigonid master of Macedonia,
Demetrios I Poliorketes, declared a Sacred War and attacked (Plut. Demet r
. 40±1:
Athen. 6.253b±f; LefÁ evre 1998b); eight years later the Spar tan king Areus assembled
a Peloponnesian coalition and did the same (Just. 24.1.1±7). Aitolian tradition would
have dictated withdrawal back into their rough hinterlands in reaction to these two
experiences; instead, a new generation of leaders led their fellows into fur ther en
gagement. In the year following Areus' (unsuccessful) attack, Aitolian forces seized
control of the old Spar tan stronghold at Herakleia Trachis, commanding both Duo
Vouna and Thermopylai (Paus. 10.20.9). When the Celts came calling the year after
that, the Aitolian ethnos
was waiting for them (Scholten 2000: 19±25).
There were some notable absences from the Greek defenders at Thermopylai in
279/78. The Akarnanians, the Aitolians' western neighbours, stayed home. They
were no friends of the Aitolians, having fought them for generations over control of
the central and lower Acheloos river valley that stretched between Akarnania's two
most advanced settlements, Stratos and Oiniadai (Schoch 1997: 1±72; Dany 1999:
1±61). More surprising as absentees were the peoples of the Peloponnesian peninsula
in general, and in par ticular the Spar tans, who had anchored an earlier, epic defence
of that pass against a barbarian horde. The easiest explanations for this circumstance
are proximity and topography. Between Thermopylai and the Peloponnese lay the
lands of the Lokrians (east and west), Phokians, Boiotians and Megarians, to say
nothing of the allure of Attika. And any raiders who might persevere would then
confront two formidable natural obstacles: the Isthmus of Corinth in the east, and the
Rhion±Antirrhion strait to the west. It is no coincidence that the only Peloponnesian
polity to attempt to send a contingent nor th were the Patraians (Paus. 7.18.5, 20.3;
10.22.4): theirs is the closest pol is
on the south side of the latter water way.
The Patraians' actions, however, may also signal another reason for the Pelopon
nesian abstention: regional political chaos. Patrai was a key community within one of
the oldest of the ethne
Ã of the Peloponnese: that of the Achaians. Their lands com
prised a series of small alluvial plains that open onto the Corinthian Gulf coast from
the mountains of the nor thern Peloponnese. At least a dozen settlement areas ± some
with a central site of suf ficient complexity and hinterlands to behave as a polis
± arose
there along the stretch running west from modern Xylokastro to past Dyme: Pellene,
Aigira, Aigai, Bura, Helike, Aigion, Rhypes, Patrai, Pharai, Olenos, Dyme and Tritaia
(but cf. Walbank 1957: 230±2). The members of these communities had forged a
common regional identity in the Archaic and Classical eras around the cult and
142 Joseph B. Scholten



sanctuar y of Zeus Homarios, near Aigion (Larsen 1968: 80±9). In the earlier four th
centur y the Achaians had been suf ficiently ambitious and cohesive to lay hold of the
coastal plain of Aiolis along the nor th shore of the Gulf ± including the Homeric
vintage settlements at Pleuron and Kalydon ± as well as the Naupaktia. They had also
been advanced and flexible enough in their thinking about their common identity to
extend its bounds across the Rhion±Antirrhion strait, of fering full membership in the
ethnos to the populations of these two communities (BommeljÂ e 1988; Merker 1989).
In the second book of his histor y the Achaian statesman Polybios presents an
account of the growth of his own koinon in the Peloponnese, as a parallel to that of
Rome in the Mediterranean. Immodest as this decision may seem, it does shine a few
points of light into the historiographical gloom that other wise obscures develop
ments on the mainland and elsewhere prior to events of the 220s. For present
purposes it is notewor thy that Polybios indicates that, by the early third centur y,
Macedonian inter ventions (most likely Antigonid, in the main) had not merely ended
the Achaians' extramural experimentation; they had caused theethnos itself to dissolve
(Polyb. 2.40.5±6). At the time of the Celtic invasions, the four westernmost commu
nities of Dyme, Patrai, Tritaia and Pharai had only just re-established their ethnic
federation, probably taking advantage of the decline in Antigonid for tunes in preced
ing years (Walbank 1957: 233). The Patraians' dispatching of a force in 279/78 may
thus also represent an act of renewed Achaian self-asser tion across the Corinthian
Gulf. It would require a fur ther generation, however, for the other sur viving com
munities to reforge their lost links to each other (cf. Urban 1979: 1±12).
To the south of Achaia, conditions in the Peloponnese in 279 are more obscure. In
Lakonia, the Spar tan king, Areus I, had only recently rallied the region in defence of
Delphi ± but against the Aitolians, and unsuccessfully. Consequently, whatever aspir
ations he harboured now had to confront two obstacles: a) a manpower shor tage
among the Lakedaimonians perpetuated by the refusal of their richest citizens to
adjust a severe imbalance in individual landed wealth to the needs of Spar ta's age-old
socio-political regimen or vice versa; b) the revived suspicions of Spar ta's Pelopon
nesian neighbours (Just. 24.1.7; Car tledge and Spawfor th 1989: 31±3, 41±3).
Not that the Argives to the nor th and east, the Messenians to the west, or the
Megalopolitans to the west and nor th ever doubted the Spar tans' bad intentions.
But other communities ± the eastern Arkadian poleis of Tegea, Mantineia and Orch
omenos; the plutocratic oligarchy that controlled Elis; the Achaian ethnos; Corinth ±
were historically more willing to follow a Spar tan lead. This dif ference in opinion
about Spar ta in fact helped keep the Megalopolitans from uniting with their fellow
Arkadians to form a cohesive ethnos (Larsen 1968: 180±95). Instead, the anti-Spar tan
poleis were tailor-made friends to Macedonia, and the entire region a paradise for the
recr uiting agents of the mercenar y armies of the Hellenistic age. Except for Corinth.
Its wealth and location had made it a key prize in the contests of the Diadochoi;
currently, Antigonos Gonatas held the keys to its lofty citadel, and so to the rest of the
Peloponnese (Paus. 10.20.5; Hammond and Walbank 1988: 250±1).
In the event, the general absence of Peloponnesians from the anti-Gaulish coalition
was not critical. The Aitolian-dominated force held the Herakleia±Thermopylai line
so capably that a Gaulish flying column chose to make a dif ficult countermarch
around Mt. Oita and into eastern Aitolia (Pritchett 1996: 173±90), in order to
draw of f the keystone of the Greek coalition. This move, including the sack of
Macedon and the Mainland 143



underdef ended Kalli on, ha d the desire d ef fect : the Aitolians at Ther mopy lai heade d
home to help, their a llies scattere d, an d the rest o f the Celtic forc e heade d for Del phi
(Paus. 10.20±2).
That was the extent of the Gaul s' su ccess. A Pho kian-led force stopp ed the Gaul s
before Delphi. In gratitude, the Delphic±Anthelic Amphiktyonia returned to the
Phokians the tw o vot es on the council the latter had lost as a result of their sacrile
gious behav iour during the T hird Sacred War . Meanw hile, the Patraian s, a t great cost,
kept the Celts from reachi ng the Peloponne se. As both Gaulish bands attemp ted to
withdraw , they found their retu r n route s line d with A itolians an d other Helleni c ill
wishers; few Celts made it back (Schol ten 2000: 31±7).
While the eradicatio n of Bren nos' Gal lic coalition ended the Celtic thre at to the
souther n mai nland, it did not end Celtic mischief in the souther n Bal kans. In
Macedonia , confusion reigne d fo r several more years (Hammo nd and Walbank
1988: 253±8); in Th racian lands trouble las ted even longer . The variou s raiding
bands that beset the region were anything but stable. Brennos' band, most nota bly ,
had reached a par ting of the way s ere it even got to Macedonia . T he defec tors led by a
cer tain Leon norios and a cer tain Luturios prefer red to take the southe asterly route,
into Thrac e. Some made it as far as L ysimache ia on the Gallipoli peninsul a, othe rs
would event ually cross ove r into Asia Minor (Mitche ll, this volum e).
3 Antigonos Takes Charge
The pre sence of these Celt s at L ysim acheia gave A ntigonos Gon atas, son of Mace
don's for mer king, Dem etrios Poliorke tes, an excuse to inter ven e. His forc es cr ushed
them, a success that in tur n vaulte d him , howeve r precar iously , into the leaders hip of
the Macedonian ethnos (D.L. 2.141; Just. 25.1±2). Given the chaos that preceded
his retur n, Antigon os' ability in the after math of the battle of L ysimache ia a) to
re-establi sh or der in Macedonia , b) to reass er t Macedonia n cont rol ove r the Thessal
ian ethnos, c) to reconstr uct Macedonia's hegemony in the souther n mainland, and d)
to sur viv e as king to a ripe old age before su ccumbing to na ture, must be cons idered
among the more remarkable pol itical achie vements of the third-cent ur y Gre ek world .
His caree r, therefore , and those of his successor s, Dem etrios II (Gonatas' so n, regn.
240/39 ±230/2 9), and Antigon os III Doson (Gonatas' nephe w , regn. 229±22 2/1),
of fer a su itable frame work for the following nar rative of polit ical developm ents in the
souther n Balk ans d own to 221.
The study o f the Antigon ids is handica pped by evidenc e that is limited and often
biased , concen trating on failure ra ther than success. A s a cons equence, the Antigon id
regime gives the appe arance of lurching from crisis to crisis . Obviousl y we cannot
ignore the evi dence we do have. But its nature sh ould also not b lind us to the long
stretche s of peace that the A ntigonids bro ught to their homeland , yea rs that allowed
the Macedonian ethnos to recover from the Gallic disaster, to retur n to its previous
prospe rity , and so to par ticipa te in the larg er institution al dev elopments that were
sweeping acro ss neighbo uring lands in the mid -to-late third centur y .
The first challe nge to Gonatas' posi tion was the retur n in 275 to Epeir os, an d then
Macedonia , of the (b riefly) on ce and future king , Py r rhos. The seeming ef for tle ssness
of Pyr rhos ' march into Upper Mace donia, his defea t the re of Gonatas, and his
subseque nt seizure of the cent ral Macedonia n plain, might easily misl ead us into
144 Joseph B. Scholten



ignoring Antigonos' accomplishments in the preceding two years. The equal ease
with which Gonatas re-established his dominance once Pyrrhos' attention wandered
indicates that Gonatas had already done much to erase any doubts left by his father's
mis-reign. A major step was his quick reasser tion of Macedonian control over Thes
saly, evidenced by Pyrrhos' attention to that region (Diod. 22.11; Just. 25.3.5±8;
Plut. Pyrrh. 26; Paus. 1.13.2; Walbank 1984a: 230).
By 272 Gonatas was in a position to shadow Pyrrhos when the latter led his forces
south to the Peloponnese. And he contributed in no small way to the failure of
Pyrrhos' serial attacks there against Spar ta and Argos. When the man whom Gonatas
himself likened to a talented but undisciplined craps-shooter met his end during an
ill-advised nocturnal sneak attack against Argos, Gonatas himself moved aggressively
to assure friendly regimes in as many Peloponnesian polities as possible (Plut.Pyrrh.
26±34; Paus. 1.13.6±7; Just. 25±6; Fellman 1930; Hammond and Walbank 1988:
259±66).
4 The Last Stand of the Polis
Gonatas' bold steps into the political vacuum left by Pyrrhos' death may have helped
to spark the second apparent threat to Antigonos' regime: the so-called Chremoni
dean War of the 260s. While some of the roots of this conflict may be found in
broader struggles between the major Hellenistic regimes (Ager, this volume), funda
mentally it was simply a renewal, albeit the final one, of the long-running twilight
struggle of the poleis of southern Greece against Macedonian hegemony (Heinen
1972; Habicht 1997: 142±9).
Fittingly, the list of par ticipants in the anti-Antigonid coalition is headed by the
Athenians and the Spar tans. Areus, apparently reinvigorated after the repulse of
Pyrrhos, was a prime mover, intent as ever on establishing himself among the great
kings of his day (Heinen 1972: 117±39; Will 1979: 223; Cartledge and Spawfor th
1989: 35±6). The motion by the Athenian statesman Chremonides contains a ringing
call to the defence of Greek freedom; the fact that this slogan had long since become a
mainstay of anti-Macedonian rhetoric does not necessarily mean that its use here is
purely formulaic (Austin 49; Lehmann 1988). Gonatas seems to have moved in the
early 260s to expand his influence in Euboia from his base at Chalkis (Knoepfler
1993: 338±9; 1995: 141±4). For an Attic population already outraged by his con
tinuing occupation of the Piraeus (Habicht 1979:102±7), Gonatas' activism on the
other side of the Euboian channel must have been alarming indeed.
The extent of the coalition (which also included the poleis of eastern Arkadia, the
Achaians, Eleians, Phigaleians and unnamed Cretan allies), its backing by the Ptol
emaic regime, the apparent length of the struggle, and the likelihood that at one
point during its course Pyrrhos' son and successor, Alexander II, emulated his father
by driving Gonatas from central Macedonia, together leave the impression that the
Chremonidean coalition posed a grave threat to Gonatas' regime. Once again,
however, it is impor tant to keep matters in perspective. Alexander's campaign,
whose precise date and relationship to the struggle in the south remain unclear, was
the only genuine setback Gonatas experienced during these years, and seems to have
had even less impact than had Pyrrhos' raid in the previous decade (Just. 26.2).
Other wise, the Macedonian fetters ser ved Gonatas well. His base at Corinth kept
Macedon and the Mainland 145



Areus and his Peloponnesian allies from coming to the Athenians' aid, indeed Areus
was killed in one of the attempts to break through (Trogus
Prol
. 26; Plut.
Agis
3;
Paus. 3.6.5±6). Gonatas was thus free to strangle Attika from Piraeus and Chalkis.
Ptolemaic forces countered by establishing a base at Koroni on the east Attic coast,
but that measure, or any other they under took, was inef fective (Paus. 1.1.1, 1.7.3,
3.6.4±6; Caskey 1982). Whatever was the precise relationship of the enigmatic naval
battle of Kos to this struggle on the mainland, the result was the same: Spar ta's quest
for revival died with Areus at Corinth, and Athens was forced to surrender. Gonatas'
dominance over mainland Greek af fairs was even greater than before.
It was an epochal moment, par ticularly for Athenians, as exemplified by the fate of
the statesman and writer Philochoros (
FGrH
328). Unable (or unwilling) to go flee
into exile (and Ptolemaic ser vice), as did so many other members of Athens' anti
Macedonian leadership (E
Â
tienne and PiÂ erar t 1975), Philochoros was captured and
executed by Antigonid forces. With him died the long tradition of Atthidography;
never again was Athens' histor y and lore the recipient of such single-minded investi
gation and glorification (Jacoby 1949). Spar ta had lost one king and some of his
followers, but little else. A generation later it would produce a new group ready to
make yet another run at revival. Athenians lost their independence. Gonatas installed
a governor and garrison at Athens, and occupied the various for ts of Attika (Habicht
1997: 146). Athenians' will to power was so shattered that Gonatas could loosen his
grip after only a few years (Paus. 3.6.6). Moreover, when the Antigonids' opponents
liberated Athens in 229 by buying out Attika's remaining Antigonid garrisons, the
Athenians responded by adopting a policy of strict neutrality (Habicht 1997: 173±8).
Antigonos Gonatas' victor y in the Chremonidean War was not entirely without
cost to him. It was probably no accident that one major mainland coalition was
conspicuous by its absence from the (admittedly scanty) historical record for Gonatas'
struggles both with Pyrrhos and also with the Spar tan±Athenian alliance: the
Aitolians, and their Boiotian and Phokian friends. Aitolians, of course, probably had
little love for Areus after his antics of the late 280s (section 2 above). But their
experience with Gonatas' father in the early 280s had been even less pleasant, and
could have been disastrous had not Pyrrhos come to their rescue (LefÁe vre 1998b).
Fur ther, when Gonatas tried to assure a friendly regime in Elis in the aftermath of
Pyrrhos' death, Aitolians played no small par t in helping their old friends to thwar t
him (G Â omez EspelosÂ õn 1991; Scholten 1990). Yet neither do Aitolians (nor their
allies) seem to have played an active role in suppor t of Pyrrhos' last campaign.
Evidently some Aitolians were hesitant to boost fur ther the for tunes even of an old
friend and benefactor (Scholten 2000: 49±51). Inaction was, of course, hardly
unprecedented Aitolian communal behaviour (Scholten 2000: 13±25). And in the
aftermath of Kallion it would not be surprising had many Aitolian leaders and their
followers preferred to stay home and tend to their own troubles rather than sallying
for th again to seek new ones.
Other developments during the same years, however, suggest that not all Aitolians
were eager to melt back into the hills. Inscriptions at Delphi recording the activities of
the Delphic±Anthelic
Amphiktyonia
reveal a new member
ethnos
in the early 270s: the
Aitolians (
CID
4.12). Whatever had been the relationship between these two com
munities previously (Arnusch 2000), in the wake of the Gauls the legitimacy of the
Aitolians' control over Apollo's oracle was less easily questioned. Lest any visitor
146
Joseph B. Scholten



forget their sacrifices, and par ticularly the suf fering of Kallion, the Aitolian commu
nity (and individual Aitolians) bedecked the sanctuar y with memorials to their
heroism (Reinach 1911; Jacquemin 1985; Scholten 2000: 37±45).
More significantly, the ethnos also seems to have resor ted to a tactic it had employed
episodically in the past: territorial expansion. The same Amphiktyonic inscriptions
that record the Aitolians' acquisition of their first seats at the Delphic±Anthelic table
also seem to reveal subsequent increases in the size of the Aitolian delegation. By the
conclusion of the Chremonidean War, six or seven Aitolian delegates were voting at
council meetings (CID 4.38, 4.43). At the same time, some traditional delegations
were not doing so: Dolopians, Ainianes, Metropolitan Dorians, East Lokrians (Schol
ten 2000: 240±9). The obvious inference is that the Aitolians' new votes were those
of these smaller ethne Ã.
Less clear is the process by which these switches occurred. Again, one explanation
seems obvious: the Aitolians' simply seized the votes, in order to conver t the council
into an instr ument of Aitolian propaganda. Yet, if such was their goal, the Aitolians
pursued it at a surprisingly dilator y rate: it is not until the later 240s that Aitolians
clearly use the Amphiktyonic council to bolster their own agendas, and not until the
230s that Aitolians have an absolute majority of Amphiktyonic votes. Epigraphic
evidence from Thermon suggests an alternative explanation. They document the
fitful but steadily growing election of individuals from many of the ef fectedethne Ã to
the executive board of the Aitolian association. The Aitolians may not, therefore, have
brazenly occupied these neighbouring lands, but rather absorbed them, through
extension to the residents of these territories of full rights in the Aitolian political
community. The change in the ethnic identification of the Amphiktyonic votes
controlled by these lands was, in this scenario, simply a reflection of the acquisition
of an additional political identity, of membership in a Greater Aitolia.
Self-redefinition is a constant feature of human histor y, and the ancient Greeks
were skilled practitioners of the ar t. For Aitolians, the experience of 279/8, to say
nothing of the turmoil surrounding the final str uggle of Pyrrhos and Gonatas,
provides a reasonable context for a reconsideration of the human boundaries of
their political identity, par ticularly when an expansion of their conceptual horizons
could solidify the loyalty of neighbours whose lands could act as a buf fer against the
outside for the communities of the old ethnos. New adherents too could benefit.
Membership in Greater Aitolia not only freed neighbouring ethne Ã from the age-old
threat of Aitolian raiding, it also of fered protection against the perhaps more
frightening prospect of a resurgent, Antigonid Macedonia. Dolopians, Dorians of
the Metropolis, Lokrians east and west, may all in fact have sought admission to the
Aitolians' polity (Scholten 2000: 45±70).
Nor was the Aitolian ethnos the only member state of the Delphic±Anthelic
Amphiktyonia engaged in such vote swapping during these years. Documents dating
to the later 270s and 260s show first the Boiotian and then the Phokian delegations
growing from two to three, and then back to two votes, in shor t succession, while the
single vote of the East Lokrian ethnos disappears, reappears, and then re-disappears. At
the end of the chain, the Aitolian delegation rises by one (LefÁe vre 1995: 169±80;
Scholten 2000: 245±6). It looks as though two age-old rivals within the Amphiktyo
nic coalition got into a tussle about territor y, and not necessarily with the approval of
the object of their contention. The Aitolians apparently settled the issue by bringing
Macedon and the Mainland 147



the communities of Epiknemedian Lokris into Greater Aitolia, along with the pass at
Thermopylai which lay within these lands (Scholten 2000: 68±70).
This seeming instability within their own alliance would cer tainly help to explain
the Aitolians' abstention from the Chremonidean War. For Gonatas, at least, keeping
the Aitolian community (and its militar y and strategic resources) on the sideline was
perhaps an acceptable outcome. Indeed he may have encouraged it by declining to
contest Aitolian influence at Delphi, and the creeping growth of Greater Aitolia
(Errington 1990: 170; Knoepfler 1995: 156; but Hammond and Walbank 1988:
289). Whether he connived at the Boiotian±Phokian rivalr y is unknowable at present,
but cer tainly he would have been glad at least to keep them out of action, as much as
their Aitolian allies.
If Antigonos hoped that this policy might win the Aitolians and their associates to
his side, he was probably disappointed. Tr ue, the admittedly slim record of Alexan
der's II's foray into Macedonia of fers no sign that the Molossian received any help
from his once and future allies. But when Alexander was himself, in turn, driven from
his realm by a Macedonian counter-attack (Just. 26.2.11±12), Aitolians undoubtedly
of fered Alexander comfor t and suppor t for his own return to power. Moreover, the
period of Gonatas' triumph also witnessed a much belated Amphiktyonic recognition
of the Lagid
Ptolemaieia
festival. An attempt to curr y favour with Philadelphos in the
face of Antigonos' cr ushing of Ptolemy's erstwhile allies? Another and less ambigu
ously self-defensive action probably also belongs to these years: an alliance between
the Aitolians and their long-time nemesis to the west, the
ethnos
of the Akarnanians
(
IG
91
2
.1, 3). The terms of the treaty hint at a larger coalition of the polities of
western Greece, from Olympia (Elis) in the south to Dodona (Molossis) in the nor th
(Scholten 2000: 77±83; cf. Grainger 1995a: 328).
The Chremonidean War thus left the Greek mainland in something of a cold peace.
Gonatas was clearly the dominant player, with the resources of Macedonia and
Thessaly at his disposal, while two of the three greatest traditional powers of the
south, Athens and Spar ta, were broken or neutralized. The network of bases and
friendly regimes by which Antigonos had choked of f the recent threat was intact, and
even enhanced. The third older power, Thebes and the Boiotian
ethnos
, was allied
with the greatest potential threat to Gonatas' position, the Aitolian
koinon
, but was
increasingly subordinate to its erstwhile protÂ eg Â es. And the wandering of the East
Lokrian Amphiktyonic vote (to say nothing of the anomaly of the Akarnanian
alliance) indicates that there were tensions within the Aitolian alliance that Gonatas
could exploit, if need be.
5 The Emergence of Achaia
By about 255 Gonatas felt secure enough to lift his foot a bit from the neck of the
Athenians (Paus. 3.6.6; Habicht 1997: 152). Victor y at the naval battle of Kos may
have added to his confidence. These same years, however, may also have seen actual
fracturing within the Aitolian coalition. Boiotian and Phokian attendance at Amphik
tyonic gatherings is sporadic across the 250s, and these same years seem the best
location for an Aitolian±Epeirote agreement to par tition Akarnania (Scholten 2000:
83±91). If Antigonos had any thoughts of tr ying to exploit the Aitolians' preoccupa
tions, however, another pair of interrelated events late in the decade quelled them.
148
Joseph B. Scholten



The first was the emergence at Sikyon in the nor theast Peloponnese of an ambi
tious and energetic young leader: Aratos, son of an assassinated tyrant of the city. In
251 Aratos brought an end to more than a decade of tumult there by driving out the
latest tyrant, recalling Sikyon's many exiles, and then aligning his polis with the
Achaian ethnos to the west (Plut. Arat. 2±9). In preceding years the latter had
reacquired all of its traditional member-communities; Doric Sikyon, however, had
never been among them. Whether the par ties to this new breach of old ethnic
boundaries were acting under the influence of their Aitolian neighbours across the
gulf or were simply harking back to Achaian actions of the early four th centur y,
the addition of Sikyon immediately raised Greater Achaia to a prominent power in the
Peloponnese and, potentially, beyond (Urban 1979: 9±37; Walbank 1984a: 243±6).
There was a problem, however: what sor t of relationship did the members of this
association want with the Antigonids? It seems clear that the communities of the old
Achaian ethnos had expelled many an Antigonid garrison or Antigonid-friendly
regime in the process of reconstructing their political community after 281 (Walbank
1957: 233±4). But Sikyon's recent leadership, Aratos' father included, had had a
much warmer relationship with Gonatas.
This potential source of internal tension was to be resolved by a second develop
ment. Antigonos governed his holdings in southern Greece through a viceroy, who
handled the bases at Chalkis, Piraeus and Corinth. By the later 250s Gonatas' half
brother, Krateros, had been succeeded in this post by his own son, Alexander. At
some point, but probably before Aratos' coup, Alexander rebelled against Gonatas
(Orsi 1987; Hammond and Walbank 1988: 296±303). For Achaians, Alexander's
action was a godsend, and they quickly threw their suppor t to him. Aratos and the
Sikyonians then had to change their allegiance (Plut. Arat. 18; Trogus Prol. 26;
Urban 1979: 38±45).
The loss of his bastions at Corinth and Chalkis was a severe blow to Gonatas'
carefully constructed control mechanism in the southern mainland, although with
garrisons in Attika and friends such as Aristomachos at Argos he still retained
enough resources to contain his nephew (SIG 3 454, ISE 1.23). It is probably no
coincidence that in the following years Aratos and the Achaians convinced the
Boiotians to break from the Aitolian coalition. A failed Aitolian coup at Sikyon
just prior to Aratos' successful one cer tainly gave this nouveau Achaian reason to
acquire his adoptive ethnos' old animosity towards Aitolians (Polyb. 20.4±5; Plut.
Arat. 4, 16).
The attempt against Sikyon in fact signals the emergence in these same years of a
new generation of Aitolian leaders who were ready and willing to exploit more fully
their polity's expanding power and influence. A less belligerent move in the same
direction was the Aitolians' decision, probably in the late 250s, to reorganize a local
festival they had founded in commemoration of the deliverance of Delphi into a
Panhellenic af fair intended to equal the greatest such traditional gatherings ( SIG 3
408; Nachtergael 1977: 209±390; Elwyn 1990; Champion 1995; Scholten 2000:
237±8). It is easy to imagine that this development might have symbolized to uneasy
Boiotians the final reversal of the power dynamic in their centur y-old relationship
with the Aitolians, and thus opened them to Achaian approaches. It must also be
noted, however, that the Boiotian alliance with his own Achaian allies opened for
Alexander an overland connection between his other wise isolated bases at Chalkis and
Macedon and the Mainland 149



Corinth. It therefore seems reasonable to guess that Alexander was somehow in
volved in the Achaian±Boiotian alliance (Scholten 2000: 85±8).
Yet, while probably a greater threat to Gonatas' position than the Chremonidean
uprising, Alexander's revolt brought no direct long-term consequence. Greater
Aitolia played the par t of ally, whether of ficially or as mere enemies of enemies,
crushing the Boiotians in 245 at Chaironeia (Scholten 2000: 93, 123±7). The Boio
tians then returned to the Aitolian fold. More impor tantly, at about this same time
Alexander himself died, leaving his rump kingdom to his widow Nikaia. By 243
Gonatas was able to trick her into surrendering to him the keys to Acrocorinth (as
well as Chalkis?), thereby re-establishing the dominant position he had held in the
later 260s and 250s (Plut. Arat. 17; Polyaen. 6.5; Picard 1979: 274±8).
Tyche, however, had one more reversal to inflict upon the ageing Antigonos. In
243, during his second term as governor-general (strategos) of Greater Achaia, the
still-young Aratos achieved his most famous exploit: the seizure of Acrocorinth by a
daring night assault. In its immediate aftermath, the Corinthians followed their
Sikyonian neighbours across the ethnic divide and into Achaian-ness (Polyb.
2.43.4±6; Plut. Arat. 18±24; Polyaen. 4.3.6; Urban 1979: 48±53). Greater Achaia
thereby raised its impor tance in Greek politics by yet another order of magnitude.
Fur thermore, soon after wards the Achaians secured an alliance with the Spar tans,
reviving (yet again) under a new, reformist Eur ypontid king: Agis IV (Plut.Arat. 31,
Agis 13).
These final indignities tempt us to conclude that, at the time of his death (early
239?: Ehrhardt 1975: 140), Antigonos II Gonatas left to his son, Demetrios II, a
regime in decline. Once again, however, some perspective is needed. As far as
concerns Aratos, the Achaians and the Spar tans, it is impor tant to note that in 241
they were unwilling (or unable?) to confront a relatively small Aitolian raiding par ty as
it crossed the isthmus into the Peloponnese. Aratos eventually eliminated this band,
but only after sending Agis and his Spar tans home out of fear for their progressive
agenda, and as the Aitolians were in the process of sacking the impor tant eastern
Achaian settlement at Pellene (Plut. Arat. 31±2, Agis 14±15; Scholten 2000: 123±7).
Fur thermore, whatever the nature of his relationship with the Aitolians, Antigonos
cer tainly bequeathed to Demetrios a healthy string of client regimes in key Pelopon
nesian poleis such as Argos and Megalopolis. More impor tantly, however, and from
a broader perspective, any troubles Gonatas left to his son were in the south. There
is no hint of upheaval in Thessaly after the late 270s, and with the exception of the
two brief Epeirote forays Macedonia itself seems to have enjoyed a period of tran
quillity equal to that of the halcyon days of Philip II and Alexander III. For a
Macedonian monarch of any era, that was a remarkable accomplishment (Will
1979: 338±43).
6 Demetrios II (`The Aitolian'?)
If the realm which Antigonos II Gonatas bequeathed to his son, Demetrios II, was
secure and healthy, that which Demetrios left to his young son Philip V a decade later
was anything but. Our historical tradition for third-centur y Greece is always spotty, at
best, but it becomes par ticularly thin for Demetrios' reign. What does seem clear is
that Demetrios spent much of his kingship battling an unusual southern alliance, and
150 Joseph B. Scholten



ended it ± suddenly ± while fighting a new wave of invasions from Macedonia's
Illyrian neighbours (Ehrhardt 1975: 198±223).
What was unusual about Demetrios' southern opponents was not only their
identity ± those age-old adversaries, the Aitolians and the Achaians ± but the nature
of their polities. For the first time, resistance to Macedonian domination over
southern Greece was not being led by a coalition of independent poleis, but rather
by an alliance of regional states, and a close one, at that (Scholten 2000: 139±44).
Fur thermore, Demetrios may have prompted this coalition of two of the largest
Greek koina by his own dealings with another such entity: the Epeirote state. Our
sources indicate that, after recovering his throne in the late 260s, Alexander II had
continued his family tradition of friendship with the Aitolian state. Indeed, as noted
above, at some point in the 250s or, perhaps, early 240s Alexander II had joined the
Aitolians in par titioning Akarnania. According to Justin the asser tiveness implicit in
the Aitolians' par ticipation in this pact led to the troubles of the 230s (28.1.1). When
Alexander died, probably in the late 240s, his widow Olympias came to fear the
growing power and ambitions of Aitolians, individually and collectively. Accordingly,
she abandoned the Aiakid±Antigonid rivalr y and instead of fered her daughter to
Demetrios in marriage; Demetrios accepted. It was, most likely, in reaction to this
turn of events that Aitolian±Achaian relations began to warm, leading to friendship
and then alliance. By spring 238 the Aitolians and Achaians, together with the
Boiotian koinon, were at war with the Macedonian±Epeirote axis that also included
the Thessalian ethnos (Plut. Arat. 33; Polyb. 2.44; Hammond and Walbank 1988:
317±23; Scholten 2000: 132±9).
At least during its early course, this conflict was no par ticular disaster for Deme
trios. If he, rather than his grandfather, is the Demetrios nicknamed `Aitolikos'
mentioned by Strabo (10.2.4), then Gonatas' son in fact raided the south Aitolian
coastal plain of Aiolis, destroying the venerable settlement at Pleuron in the process
(Ehrhardt 1978). Moreover, by 235, if not before, Demetrios seems to have struck at
the Aitolians' Achilles' heel, boldly marching into Boiotia. Once again, enough
Boiotians were conflicted about Aitolian power that the region defected to Demetrios
(Scholten 2000: 153±7). Fur thermore, at some point one of Demetrios' generals
inflicted a serious defeat upon Achaian forces in the Peloponnese (Plut.Arat. 34).
If Demetrios is indeed `Aitolikos', it is also possible that this nickname was no
compliment. For while he was pressuring his enemies' weak spots, the Achaian±
Aitolian alliance was pushing back, and with greater ef fect the longer the war
continued. Already by 235, Aratos and his Peloponnesian cohor ts convinced one
of Demetrios' most impor tant Peloponnesian suppor ters, the tyrant L ydiades of
Megalopolis, to defect. Other Arkadian communities and regimes followed L ydiades'
lead into Greater Achaia. By the late 230s, Antigonid influence in the Peloponnese
had essentially evaporated (Urban 1979: 88±96; Hammond and Walbank 1988:
329±31; Scholten 2000: 157±62).
More seriously, these same years saw similar developments along the western,
southern and nor thern frontiers of Macedonia itself. In Epeiros, fate (aided, in all
likelihood, by Aitolian pressure) led to the extinction of the Aiakid dynasty. Those
members who did not succumb to nature were exterminated by rebellions in the
capital, Ambrakia. That southern region, along with the adjoining land of the
Amphilochians, then became par t of Greater Aitolia. The more nor therly and westerly
Macedon and the Mainland 151



por tions of Epeiros reconstituted themselves as a democratic regional state, the
koinon of the Epeirotes, with its central site at Phoinike in Chaonia (Cabanes 1976:
97±100, 198±200).
The allegiance of this new state, however, remained ver y much in play due to
developments further up the Adriatic coastline. There, among the Illyrian population,
new regional coalitions and leadership were emerging and putting pressure on
neighbouring communities. Eventually their activities would lead to the first of
the great Roman militar y inter ventions in eastern Mediterranean matters, the First
Illyrian War of 229. Before then, however, Demetrios was able to transform the
westernmost of these Illyrian groups, led by Agron, from a threat into an ally. Most
famously, in 231 he arranged for an Illyrian force to sail to the relief of Medeon in
Akarnania, which Aitolian forces had under siege. In the following year, Agron's
widow independently turned the attention of her followers to the Epeirotekoinon. In
response to an Epeirote appeal, an Aitolian±Achaian relief force stopped the Illyrians,
but the Epeirotes nonetheless opted to sign a pact with their attackers (as well as
independent Akarnania) to oppose the Achaian±Aitolian coalition. Finally, in spring
229, yet another Illyrian force set out, this time against Epidamnos, Apollonia and
Kerkyra. The Aitolian±Achaian alliance once again demonstrated remarkable internal
cohesion and organizational skill in responding to this renewed threat, but failed to
stop it at a naval battle of f the Pachoi islands. In the end, Epeiros remained hostile,
but also weakened (Hammond and Walbank 1988: 332±5; Scholten 2000: 145±53).
Demetrios' greater failures, however, occurred simultaneously, along the nor thern
and southern frontiers of the hear tland of his realm. To the south, it appears that
Aitolians made concer ted and at least par tially successful efforts to revive old anti
Macedonian feelings in Thessaly. Amphiktyonic documents indicate that by the
late 230s the Aitolians were seating at least 11 delegates at the Delphic±Anthelic
council. According to the interpretative approach adopted above, these votes reflect
the addition of fur ther Amphiktyonic lands to Greater Aitolia, most likely the
remaining small ethne Ã of east central Greece, followed by the western por tion of
Phthiotic Achaia (Scholten 2000: 250±1). A more direct danger to Macedonia,
however, arose in the later 230s in the form of a resurgent Dardanian kingdom.
Demetrios' preoccupation with this threat may, in fact, have forced him to buy
Agron's assistance, and prompted oppor tunistic action by his opponents to the
south. Worse, his campaign against the Dardanians proved to be Demetrios' swan
song, and a disastrous one at that. Whether or not Demetrios actually died in the
course of being routed by the Dardanians, the fact remains that by early 229
Macedonia's army had been shattered, and its king was dead (Polyb. 2.44). As
Demetrios' son, Philip V, was not even ten years old (Tarn 1940), the Macedonian
ethnos was again effectively leaderless. The situation that Demetrios II left was thus as
precarious as that of 280/79, or 360/59 (Hammond and Walbank 1988: 335±6;
Errington 1990: 173±5).
To be fair to Demetrios, he had more than his unfair share of bad fortune. His
opponents to the south, the Achaian and Aitolian koina, had blazed new trails
in mainland Greek political thinking and behaviour by the remarkable degree of
co-operation and co-ordination that they achieved. It is typical of their performance
against Demetrios, and their potential as a counter weight against Macedonia, that at
the same time they were sallying forth against an Illyrian fleet, Aitolians and Achaians
152 Joseph B. Scholten



also moved aggressively to exploit the Macedonian king's death. In the Peloponnese,
the tyranny at Argos finally gave way and joined its polis into Greater Achaia. Aratos
also turned his people's attention eastward, bringing Megara and Aigina into their
association, and brokering the buyout of the Antigonid garrisons in Attika. Athenian
gratitude, however, did not extend to joining the Achaian association (Plut.Arat. 34;
Paus. 2.8.6; Urban 1979: 63±70; Habicht 1997: 173±6). Aitolians seem to have
scored coups whose potential was even greater. In Boiotia, at the ver y least pro
Antigonids lost their recent ascendancy. More impor tantly, significant por tions of
Thessaly openly rebelled against Macedonian control, and may even have joined the
Aitolian association (Scholten 2000: 165±70).
7 The Kleomenian Crisis (229±222)
As in the other major crises noted above, however, so too in this one the Macedonian
ethnos found an extraordinar y leader to turn the tide. Antigonos III `Doson' was
Demetrios II's cousin; having sur vived the debacle of the assassination of his father,
he had achieved suf ficient stature in Macedonia to be designated guardian of Philip
and commander of Macedonian forces (Ehrhardt 1975: 224±40; le Bohec 1993). His
per formance fully justified his peers' judgement. After rallying theethnos to drive back
the Dardanian threat, Doson then aimed a bold stroke, not at the Thessalian rebels,
but rather at their Aitolian sponsors. Most likely moving from Chalkis, Doson led an
army through east-central Greece, detaching Opous from Boiotia (as punishment for
fecklessness? Scholten 2000: 259±60), `liberating' Phokis from Aitolian domination,
sacking Kytinion in Doris, and trapping an emergency Aitolian levy near Delphi. The
revolt in Thessaly collapsed along with Aitolian resistance. By spring 227 Doson was
`king' in his own right, and secure enough to embark on a venture to Karia. He
returned after only one campaign season, however, perhaps because events in south
ern Greece had taken an unexpectedly promising turn (Bousquet 1988; Hammond
and Walbank 1988: 337±45; Walbank 1989).
The Spar tans had stayed out of Macedon's war with the Achaian±Aitolian alliance,
but can hardly have been disinterested in its later course. For while the additions of
Megalopolis and Argos to Greater Achaia lessened the danger to Lakonia from the
hated Macedonians, they also threatened to transform the Achaian association itself
into an even greater nightmare: a Peloponnesian regional state dominated by Spar ta's
traditional enemies. The prospect of such a turn of events may have played some par t
in the Spar tan alliance with the Achaians in the late 240s, and a contemporaneous
attempt by Agis IV to address the stark socio-economic inequities at Spar ta that
crippled her ability to defend herself (Car tledge and Spawfor th 1989: 38±46). Aratos'
fear of that programme's regional potential, both political and social, led to him to
snub Agis, thus opening the door for the powers that were in Spar ta to eliminate Agis
and suppress his suppor ters (Plut. Agis 13±16; Arat. 31±2). Yet the ability of a
massive Aitolian raid (launched on the convenient pretext of aiding Agis' par ty?) to
plunder Lakonia soon after wards must have brought home to all Spar ta's pathetic
weakness (Polyb. 4.34.9; 9.34.9; Plut. Cleom. 10; 18; Scholten 2000: 264±8). Thus
in 229, while Aitolians and Achaians were busy fending of f Illyrians and cour ting the
Macedon's allies, the Agiad Kleomenes III led an army out of Lakonia and into
eastern Arkadia, perhaps not so much out of delusions of lost grandeur as of fear of
Macedon and the Mainland 153



encirclement (Polyb. 2.46.2±3, 57.1±2; Plut. Cleom. 5, 14; Walbank 1984b: 456;
Car tledge and Spawfor th 1989: 46±50).
The objects of Kleomenes' first campaign, Tegea, Mantinea, Orchomenos and
Kaphyai, were probably carefully chosen. At that time these poleis were not par t of
Greater Achaia, but rather in some sor t of alliance with Greater Aitolia (Polyb.
2.46.2). Aitolia had long had interests in the western Peloponnese centred on Elis,
but these were eastern Arkadian communities which had only come to the Aitolians to
avoid being Achaian, most likely because their long-time adversaries within Arkadia,
the Megalopolitans, were exercising growing influence within Greater Achaia (Will
1979: 371±4). Thus, Kleomenes' attack was not random, but aimed at a political
fault-line ± both within Greater Achaia, and also between the Aitolian and Achaian
associations. It succeeded on both scores, perhaps even better than some in Spar ta
would have wished. Achaians faulted Aitolians for Spar ta's acquisition of eastern
Arkadia, Aitolian preoccupations in 229 notwithstanding, and the productive (and
promising) union between the two koina began to deteriorate. Achaians did not help
matters by meddling in the following years in Elis and other areas of Aitolian interest
in the western Peloponnese (Scholten 2000: 186) But it is just as clear that the
members of the Achaian association were equally at odds with each other over what to
do about Sparta. Aratos seems to have tried to avoid open war, while others such as
L ydiades of Megalopolis favoured a more aggressive approach.
Yet the thinking in Spar ta was no more unified. Indeed, the status quo group there
began to fear the prestige Kleomenes was accruing by his success. Kleomenes, for his
par t, was preparing to force Spar tans to grasp its oppor tunity. Late in 227, having left
Spar ta's citizen army on manoeuvres, Kleomenes with the assistance of mercenaries
carried out a purge in Spar ta that drove away 80 or so of the wealthiest residents of
Lakonia (Plut. Cleom. 7±11). The connection to Agis IV's early reform programme of
what Kleomenes did next, as well as his overall goal, is much debated. What seems
clear is that land was confiscated, and then distributed to a Spartiate population
whose ranks had swelled to near 5000 by the enrolment of select resident aliens
(metoikoi) and tributar y Lakonians (perioikoi). These men were to resume the ancient
Spar tan way of life, and their sons were enrolled in a revived agoge. While this
programme was carried out under the guise of returning to the ancestral, `L ykourgan'
constitution, at least one facet suggests a less idealistic agenda: the army of this new
Spar ta was to fight, not as hoplites, but as Macedonian-style phalangites (Will 1979:
374±5; Walbank 1984: 458±9; Car tledge and Spawfor th 1989: 50±3; Erskine 1990:
123±49)
Freed in the same process from oversight by traditional bodies such as the board of
ephors or the council of elders (gerousia), Kleomenes proceeded in the next two years
(226±225) to fracture the Achaian association (Plut. Arat. 39; Cleom. 12±16; Polyb.
2.51±2). Greater Achaia's disintegration is cer tainly attributable, on some level, to
Aratos' singlemindedly rapid expansion of his koinon, a policy which stands in
contrast to Greater Aitolia's more fitful but durable growth. He may well deser ve
less blame (or credit) for what ensued. For Kleomenes, too, had been in too great a
hurr y. Already in late 227, Megalopolitans began to approach their old Macedonian
masters for relief against the even more hated Lakedaimonians. Our sources see
Aratos' hand behind this appeal and subsequent ones; it is just as likely, however, to
reflect the disintegration of Achaian unity. Cer tainly, the end point of this tiger-ride
154 Joseph B. Scholten



cannot have appealed to Aratos, his family's histor y notwithstanding (Polyb. 2.47±51;
Plut. Arat. 38.11±12; Cleom. 16; Gruen 1972; cf. Urban 1979: 117±58; Walbank
1984: 461±5).
In spring 224, with Argos having gone over to Spar ta and Kleomenes besieging
Acrocorinth and Sikyon, the Achaian assembly voted to ask Antigonos Doson to
come to the rescue. His price: the surrender of Acrocorinth to his control and the
transfer of Megara to the Boiotian association. The Achaians agreed; by autumn
Argos had switched sides again, Kleomenes had withdrawn to Spar ta, and Doson
was at Corinth, with even bigger plans (Plut. Arat. 41±4; Cleom. 17±21; Polyb.
2.52±4). Following in the footsteps of Philip II and his own great-grandfather (and
namesake), Antigonos organized yet another `League of Corinth', although this third
version is better known as the `Hellenic Alliance' (Larsen 1968: 325±6; Walbank
1988: 345±53).
Like its predecessors, Doson's creation was clearly an instrument of Macedonian
diplomacy, yet one equally designed to take account of the mainlanders' sensibilities.
While its constitutional details are vague, it had the customar ysynedrion of allies, and a
leader or hegemon: Doson, of course. Unlike previous Macedonian-sponsored alli
ances of Greek states, however, Doson's symmachia was not made up of poleis; rather,
its constituents were all regional entities: the Achaians, Thessalians, Macedonians,
Boiotians, Phokians, Akarnanians and Epeirotes (Walbank 1984b: 468±9). As we
have seen, the coalitions of the war of Demetrios II had already anticipated this shift;
Doson's alliance simply confirmed that the days of the polis as a primar y agent in
Hellenic militar y af fairs were at an end. It is also impor tant to keep in mind, however,
that the powers of this new organization, and particularly of its hegemon, were
limited. Decisions were taken by the synedrion, but even then were not binding on
a member state unless ratified by that state's citizenr y. While this provision might
seem to be self-defeating, it in fact was quite ingenious. Doson and his successors
thereby would be able to gain sanction for police actions without risking driving
unenthusiastic allies into opposing arms.
In this first instance, not surprisingly, most allies were on board. When Doson and
Kleomenes finally came face to face at Sellasia in 222, the Macedonian's army
included contingents from Achaia, Akarnania, Boiotia and far of f Epeiros (Polyb.
2.65). The core of his army, however, was Macedonian or mercenar y, and its superb
training prevailed: Kleomenes' phalangites were slaughtered, he himself fled (ultim
ately, to Alexandria, and a futile end: Polyb. 2.69.10±11, 5.35±9; Plut.Cleom. 29±37;
Just. 28.4.9±12), and Doson became the first conqueror ever to enter Spar ta. There,
following the example of his uncle at Athens decades earlier, he installed a governor.
Perhaps because he had ready at hand a body of suppor ters in Kleomenes' exiled
opponents, Doson also left the Spar tans a good deal of autonomy. Once again
appealing to the `L ykourgan' past, the ephorate was re-established; but, for the
moment, no kings were installed. Nor is it clear whether Spar ta joined the Hellenic
alliance immediately. In fact, Doson's treatment was lenient, perhaps to maintain the
Spar tans as a counter weight to other Peloponnesian powers.
Just as likely, however, any mercy in Doson's clean-up after Sellasia was a matter of
haste. For no sooner had he begun to settle matters in Spar ta than messengers arrived
announcing that Macedonia was awash once again with Illyrians. Doson therefore
depar ted for the nor th, and upon arrival drove of f the invaders. But, as in the case of
Macedon and the Mainland 155



his cousin in 230/29, so too Doson fell ill during the campaign, and presently died
(Polyb. 2.70, Plut. Cleom. 30; date of death: Walbank 1957: 290 vs. Walbank 1984b:
472).
Doson left the now-adolescent Philip a much stronger realm than had Demetrios.
The homeland was secure, and its militar y as well-trained and formidable as it had
been in memor y. Thessaly was quiet; both the Aitolian and Achaian associations had
been humbled, and their alliance shattered; Spar ta's ability to make mischief in the
southern mainland had been broken; the other major (and minor) regional states of
Greece were united in a Macedonian-led mutual defence organization centred at
Corinth, whose acropolis Antigonid troops once again held. Only Athens and Attika
remained beyond Doson's grasp, and their population had forsworn fur ther adven
tures on behalf of ideals and slogans. Unfor tunately for the tranquillity of the
neighbourhood, the stability of Doson's settlement depended upon the reputation
he had achieved across his brief reign. That was one item that he could not pass along
to his stepson, Philip V.
8 A Theoretical Retrospective
The preceding narrative, focused on macropolitical events, leaves the impression that
the southern Balkans of the third centur y B C were the scene of continuous bloodlet
ting and destruction. Yet a dif ferent focus would bring other, more hear tening
developments into the foreground. Were we to ask our time-travelling theoreticians
to compare the situation at Doson's death to that they had found in 280, they would
undoubtedly note a remarkable consensus among at least the Greek communities of
this area. Across these same years, the vast majority seem to have come to the
conclusion that their interests were best ser ved by membership in a regional political
community. The two most notable exceptions, Spar ta and Athens, are also notable for
the unusually large size of their territor y. Par t of their disinterest/resistance may stem
from the fact that each already was a regional state. The case for Athens is all the
stronger as one of the fundamental characteristics of the third-centur y regional states
was a common citizenship shared by all citizens of member-communities (sympoli
teia). The demesmen of Attika had adopted such a regional identity and loyalty
already by the end of the sixth centur y B C , if not earlier.
Elsewhere, however, existing regional identities and entities took on greater sali
ence and substance. Central institutions and of fices began to proliferate, and the
constitutional prerogatives of the various levels of governance ± the details ofsympo
liteia ± were worked out. These details varied, of course: the powers and nature of the
Aitolian assembly, council and executive dif fered from those of the Achaian union.
But they ± and other sympolities ± shared a common set of institutions. Even the old
Macedonian ethnos was par t of this general trend. The precise nature of the Macedo
nian monarchy remains a matter of heated debate among scholars, as does the
relationship of that executive to other levels of governance. But recent work has
made it clear that, by the later por tion of the third centur y at the latest, Macedonians
had elaborated their local and intermediate layers of authority and ± like their
neighbours to the south ± were involved in an ongoing process of refining the rules
of their sympoliteia. The fact that their chief executive of fice was held for life and was
hereditar y, rather than elected annually and not open to consecutive terms by a single
156 Joseph B. Scholten



individual (as was true for the Achaian and Aitolian koina) meant that capable and
ambitious occupants could enhance its status and power within the Macedonian
koinon, and relative to that of the strategoi in more republican regional states (Hat
zopoulos 1996: 487±96). The Epeirote peoples reacted against that concentration of
powers by replacing their monarchic executive ± the Aiakid dynasty ± in the 230s
(Larsen 1968: 279; does the case of Sosthenes, strategos in Macedonia during the
Gallic incursions, represent a similar movement, albeit one abor ted by the arrival of
Antigonos Gonatas? Cf. Hammond and Walbank 1988: 254). Yet all alike remained
regional states, nonetheless (Cabanes 1993a). This rough uniformity would hardly
surprise our obser vers, who have long since noted the tendency of polities to adopt
and adapt the characteristics of their regional peers (Renfrew 1986). The Epeirote
evolution also reflects the general third-centur y trend toward more thoroughly
sympolitical regional states.
As inveterate model-makers, our consultants would also inevitably test the question
of `What If ?' They would hardly be pathbreakers here: mainland Greece's likely future
development if Romans had never arrived is a venerable topic. More hopeful analyses
might note the trajector y of the third centur y, and imagine yet a four th level of
identity and governance emerging in subsequent decades and centuries, perhaps even
a United States of Greece. There are signs that political loyalties and boundaries were
indeed becoming increasingly complex, malleable and situational in this area and era:
the Akarnanian±Aitolian isopoliteia (IG 9 12 .1.3), or the embassy to Xanthos of 206/
5, in which the par ticipants present themselves by local, area and regional identities, at
once Kytiniotes, Metropolitan Dorians, and Aitolians (Bousquet 1988). Cynics
would point to the subsequent reversion of the Aitolian±Akarnanian relationship to
its traditional violence as well as that of the Achaian±Aitolian alliance of the 230s, or
to the turmoil experienced by the Achaian union when it attempted to absorb the
communities of Arkadia.
These conflicts and rivalries, which continued after the arrival of the Romans, at the
ver y least suggest that in the late third centur y the peoples of the southern Balkans
were still some way from that next step, a union of the unions, that could have
produced a superstate capable of keeping the area out from under the looming
shadow of the `Clouds arising in the West' (Polyb. 5.104). Yet it is also true that
many of the regional identities and institutions that emerged in the third centur y
continued to thrive for centuries after their political eclipse by Rome. Cer tainly, one
can only agree with F. W. Walbank's view that their development reflects `the
continuing ability of the Greeks to respond to a new political challenge with new
solutions' (1992: 157).

CHAPTER TEN
The Attalids of Pergamon
Elizabeth Kosmetatou
And finally, I constantly . . . kept before your eyes these our contemporaries Eumenes and
Attalos, telling you how, inheriting a small and insignificant kingdom, they increased it so
much that it is now inferior to none, simply by their concord and agreement and their
faculty of mutual respect. (Polybios, 23.11.7±8, trans. Paton)
A remarkable family of low origins, the Attalids created a kingdom that put its mark
on the political, social and cultural developments of the Hellenistic period and
beyond. In the process they became masters of the ar t of cultivating an `international'
image, by manipulating contemporar y events and making the best of ever y oppor
tunity to construct and reconstruct their public persona, thereby rationalizing
and legitimizing their power (Gruen 2000: 17). Ancient authors such as Strabo and
Pausanias considered them to be the most representative Hellenistic dynasty and speak
admiringly of their deeds as reflected on their numerous dedications that sur vived
well into the Roman period and retained their function as non-verbal cues on the
emotions and attitudes of spectators (Strabo 13.4; Paus. 1.6.1; J. Engels 1999: 277±
89). Modern scholars sometimes attribute to them a far greater influence, especially
on their contemporar y and later ar tistic developments, a view which has been under
serious revision lately. It would, then, be fair to say that the Attalids were successful in
creating their own sense of who they were, which after so many centuries continues to
influence and even on occasion to deceive.
1 From Rags to Riches: the Origins of the Attalid Dynasty
Even though the Attalids figure as the Greek dynasty par excellence, becoming
instrumental in dif fusing Hellenism both in Asia Minor and among the Romans,
their rise to such extraordinar y power was an anomaly. Philetairos, the dynasty's
founder, was half-Greek at best. Born in about 343 in Tieion, a Paphlagonian
backwater on the Black Sea, he was repor tedly a eunuch, son of Attalos and Boa,
the latter said to be a flute-player and a cour tesan (Lucian Macr. 12.7; Athen.



13.577b; L. Rober t 1963: 320). Scholars generally agree that the name of his father
points to a Macedonian origin, but one may wonder at Macedonian presence at
Tieion as early as 344 (Hammond and Grif fith 1979: 458±63, 484±9). One may
even wonder whether the original name of Philetairos' father was not closer to the
attested indigenous Attales that was conveniently hellenized in the aftermath of
Alexander's campaign, but this supposition must remain conjecture at the current
state of the evidence (Masson 1962: 131; Zgusta 1964: 105±8; Billows 1995: 104 n.
67). Even if the family were not originally Greek, however, Greek presence in the area
may account for Attalos and Boa's decision to give their children Greek names, a
practice that was not unusual in Asia Minor (Hdt. 7.27; Zgusta 1964: no. 1310).
Nonetheless, Philetairos' personal ambition, in all likelihood cultivated by the upstar t
pretensions of his family, and his undeniable political shrewdness, landed him high
positions, and historical circumstances of fered even greater oppor tunities. It was well
known that eunuchs were highly valued by the Persian kings for their presumed
trustwor thiness as ser vants with no ambitions for self-aggrandizement since they
could never have of fspring to whom they might bequeath wealth and power. Of
course, circumstances proved their masters time and again wrong (Hdt. 8.105; Xen.
Cyr. 7.60±5). Since eunuchs continued to assume high positions in cour t, thereby
raising the for tunes of their kinsmen (Hdt. 4.43), Philetairos' family may have chosen
this cruel path for him in the hope that it would lead to a brilliant career.
Following Alexander's conquest of the Persian empire, par ts of the administration
continued to ser ve their new Macedonian masters, who seem to have shared local
ideas on the value of eunuch administrators (Badian 1958b; Scholl 1987: 115±17).
Philetairos, who was about twenty years old when Alexander died, became an of ficer
of Antigonos Monophthalmos, ser ving under his general Dokimos, whom he
followed in 302 to join the ranks of Antigonos' rival L ysimachos of Thrace. He was
eventually stationed at Pergamon, in charge of the Thracian treasure of nine thousand
talents. Historical circumstances, as well as personal ambition, led Philetairos to a
policy of gradual, steady and careful emancipation. The ancient sources mention the
struggles and intrigue in L ysimachos' cour t which in 283 culminated in the murder
of Agathokles, son and heir-apparent of L ysimachos, and victim of queen Arsinoe's
false accusations. A number of L ysimachos' of ficers, including Philetairos, declared
themselves inconsolable following the wrongful death of such a brilliant and promis
ing young man, and so afraid of Arsinoe's schemes, that they formed a conspiracy, and
defected to Seleukos I of Syria. The Thracian and Syrian armies met at Koroupedion
in 281, and L ysimachos lost in a day both his life and kingdom. He had probably
never thought it possible that Philetairos could betray him. But betray him he did: as
a eunuch, it may not have been possible for him to have children, but nothing could
prevent him from having a nephew. Following various manoeuvres, he was able to
ingratiate himself with his new master Seleukos I, and his successor Antiochos I, and
achieve a cer tain qualified autonomy for Pergamon. His nephew Eumenes I was thus
able to succeed him in power in 263 without incident (E. Hansen 1971: 14±38;
Billows 1990: 418±19).
Philetairos was not the first eunuch to assume a degree of independence in the area.
Hermias of Atarneus, the philosopher-ruler of par ts of Mysia, had set up his own
domain in the middle of the four th centur y but had been executed by the Persian
king on charges of treason (Trampedach 1994: 66±79). Philetairos was more suc
160 Elizabeth Kosmetatou



cessful and should be credited with establishing the foundations for Attalid policy that
his successors were wise enough to follow and build on. Squeezed between the
powerful Hellenistic empires, he successfully turned his small ar tificial territor y
into a well-organized domain by manipulating all the conflicts in that turbulent
period, including the Gallic invasions and the wars of the Diadochoi (IG 11.1105;
Nachtergael 1977). His delicate perseverance during the conflict between the Seleu
kids and Ptolemy Keraunos following the collapse of the kingdom of Thrace earned
him substantial autonomy: Following the treacherous assassination of Seleukos I by
Keraunos, Philetairos made a successful bid for the king's body which he properly
cremated and duly sent of f to his son and successor Antiochos I (App.Syr. 63). It was
probably after this that he received the right to issue coinage in his name featuring the
posthumous por trait of Seleukos I on the obverse (Newell 1936). He also initiated
the brilliant policy of forging non-threatening ties with neighbouring city-states: he
assisted Kyzikos in its struggle against the Galatians by sending a gift of grain
and advertised his patronage of Apollo Chresterios at Mysian Aigai (OGIS 312;
748; Allen 1983: 98±121). At the same time he secured his borders by hiring
mercenaries and founding at least one militar y colony which was known as Philetair
eia during the reign of Eumenes I (I.Perg. 13; Kosmetatou 2001). His nominal
Seleukid master apparently did not consider these actions as suspicious, and relations
between Antiochos I and Philetairos must have remained cordial since the Pergame
ne's great nephew by the name of Attalos married Antiochis, a niece of Antiochos I,
by whom he fathered the later king Attalos I.
2 Rise and Fall of a Kingdom
Eumenes I (263±241) continued his predecessor's policy of careful emancipation
from the Seleukid empire and prepared the ground for eventual revolt. Conflicts
among the Hellenistic kings, the secession of local rulers from the kingdom of Syria,
and the ever-present threat of the infamous Galatians, allowed Eumenes to take
advantage of the ensuing power gap (IG 11.1105). He continued his predecessor's
policy of establishing relations with neighbouring city-states, took steps in order to
protect his borders by maintaining militar y colonies, and eventually declared Perga
mon's independence. Even though he was victorious over Antiochos I's punitive
expedition of c. 261, he never assumed the diadem (I.Perg 13; Strabo 13.4.1±2; E.
Hansen 1971: 21±2). The por trait-coins in the name of Philetairos, that were
probably issued soon after his victor y over Antiochos I, must have been among
Eumenes' first attempts to display his newly acquired independence (Westermark
1961).
The final step towards the creation of a kingdom was taken by his nephew and
successor Attalos I (241±197) who was the first Pergamene ruler to score an impor t
ant victor y against the Galatians in c. 237, that earned him the diadem and a spear
won kingdom, allowing him to claim conquest through militar y victor y as the
foundation of his kingship. This time-honoured principle was especially used in
Macedonian royal propaganda and put Attalos on an equal footing with the other
Hellenistic kings (Billows 1995: 24±30; for a por trait bust of Attalos, figure 11.1).
Even though Attalos was the first Pergamene king, he acknowledged humble
Philetairos as the founder of his dynasty by continuing to mint Eumenes I's
The Attalids of Pergamon 161



por trait-coins of Philetairos, linking Philetairos to his own militar y successes against
the Gauls in the context of a series of dedications on Delos, and by continuing to
sponsor festivals in the name of Philetairos following his great-great uncle's tradition
(e.g. IG 11.1105±10; ID 346, 366). He also built on Philetairos' policies by estab
lishing the principles followed by all his successors in Pergamene foreign policy:
aggressive construction of a public image; the consolidation and expansion of Perga
mene territor y; and the cultivation of ties and subsequent forging of alliances with
cities, leagues and states that were presumably too weak, or located too far away, to
pose a threat to the sur vival of his kingdom. Alliances with the great powers, especially
Macedon and Syria, were to be avoided at all costs as suspicious and dangerous.
Initially Attalos I played a lone hand in his bid for an empire by exploiting the
internal conflicts within the kingdom of Syria that eventually saw the collapse of
Seleukid power in Asia Minor. Already during the reign of Eumenes I the Third
Syrian War had broken out, which began as a war for succession between the two
wives of Antiochos II and drew in Ptolemy III, brother of queen Berenike. Seleukos
II, son of Laodike, prevailed, but his kingdom was dealt a serious blow by the loss of
territor y to Ptolemaic Egypt. A few years later (c. 239) Seleukos II's rule was
challenged by his younger brother Antiochos Hierax who was stationed in Asia
Minor. Attalos I did not inter fere in the so-called `War of the Brothers' at first. In
around 230, however, Hierax and his Galatian allies chose to attack Pergamon,
provoking an Attalid reaction. Attalos I conquered the greatest par t of the Seleukid
possessions in Asia Minor and, at the same time, concluded alliances with the most
impor tant cities in the area, including Smyrna, Sardis, Aizanoi and localities in the
Troad (Polyb. 4.48.7; Ma 1999: 43±8; Ager, this volume, sections 3±4). He duly
adver tised his victories over Hierax and his `barbarians' by sponsoring at least one
triumphal monument, the base of which (the so-called `long base') was discovered at
Pergamon and was reconstructed brilliantly by Marszal (1998; figure 10.1).
Attalos I's newly augmented territor y did not remain under his control for long.
Upon his succession to the Seleukid throne, Antiochos III, continuing his father's
policy of regaining what he considered to be rightfully his, appointed his cousin
Achaios as governor for Asia Minor west of the Tauros mountains with the express
purpose of recovering all the lost land. Achaios was successful in driving Attalos I back
into his pre-230 borders and reconquering most of Asia Minor, but the Pergamene
king and the allies in the Troad that his dynasty had carefully cultivated in the

previous decades managed to stop the Seleukid general's advances fur ther north
(Kosmetatou 2001; Erskine 2001: 173±5). Fur ther losses for the Pergamenes were
prevented following Achaios' assumption of the diadem and the royal title in 220,
an act which forced Antiochos III to conclude an alliance with Attalos I against
the usurper (Polyb. 4.48.7±11, 5.107.4; OGIS 236; Allen 1983: 58±65; Ma 1999:
54±63).
Although Pergamon seemed to be safe from Seleukid aggression following Attalos
I and Antiochos' alliance against Achaios, it was obvious to Attalos that the Seleukid
king would not leave the Attalid kingdom to its own devices, especially since he had
initiated an elaborate militar y expedition and propaganda whose main theme centred
around the recover y of his `ancestral holdings' (Herrmann 1965a; Ma 1999: 26±52).
Fur thermore, the aggression of Philip V and Prusias I of Bithynia posed serious
threats to the continuing existence of the Pergamene kingdom. In this context,
Attalos turned his interest to Greece by cajoling Macedon's enemies, including
Aitolia and Athens. He also moved to create an entangling relationship with Rome,
aimed at restraining the ambitions of the Syrian, Macedonian and Bithynian kings,
reinforcing Pergamene influence in Greece and Asia Minor, and expanding the
relatively small kingdom of Pergamon. Eventually it was to become one of the largest
Hellenistic kingdoms in the second centur y B C , at least theoretically.
In the First Macedonian War Attalos I had been a rather inef fective par ticipant on
the Roman side, but the working relationship between Pergamon and Rome was to
grow closer. In 205, towards the end of the long struggle against Hannibal, the
Romans consulted the Sibylline Books where it was prophesied that Carthaginians
would be driven out of Italy if Rome introduced the cult of Magna Mater. Attalos I
was instrumental in the transfer of the Great Mother and her sacred stone from Asia
Minor to Rome in the following year, an act which opened a new chapter in the af fairs
of the Hellenistic East (Gruen 1990: 5±33; Erskine 2001: 205±24). Following Philip
V's continuing aggression in the Aegean, which undermined Pergamene and
Rhodian interests, and backed by the Achaian League, Sparta, and several cities in
Greece, Attalos I brought Rome back to the East for the Second Macedonian War, in
which he was an active par ticipant this time. He actually died as a result of a stroke
that he suf fered in 197 while tr ying to raise the Thebans against Philip V, probably
shor tly before the battle at Kynoskephalai (Allen 1983: 10 n. 6; Ma 1999: 265).
Attalos' policies were consistently followed by his two sons and successors:
Eumenes II (197±158) and Attalos II (160±138). The former inherited a diminished
kingdom, an added enemy in the form of Pharnakes of Pontos, and spent most of the
190s continuing his father's work in complaining to Rome about Antiochos III's
imperialism. His energy and ef fectiveness worried Antiochos enough to prompt him
to offer the Attalid king a daughter in marriage. This was a crossroads moment for
Pergamene policy: Eumenes' brothers, who had always been his closest advisors and
allies, recommended that he make a 180-degree turn from his predecessors' consist
ent policies and accept Antiochos' proposal, but Eumenes' desire to play for higher
stakes prevailed (Gruen 1984: 544±5; Ma 1999: 92). The Roman victor y over
Antiochos at Magnesia and the Apameia settlement that followed changed the
political map of Asia Minor. Eumenes II made significant gains as Pergamon and
Rhodes divided Seleukid possessions in the region between themselves (Gruen 1984:
640±3; Derow, chapter 4 above). He made serious ef for ts to control his newly
The Attalids of Pergamon 163



expanded kingdom by introducing, among other measures, a new monetar y policy to
the largest par t of his territor y sometime between 188 and 181. The new cistophoric
coinage circulated only in par ts of the Attalid kingdom, and the Attalids do not
appear to have imposed it as the exclusive currency ever ywhere. The coinage is named
after the `cista mystica', a circular wicker basket accompanied by a snake on the coin's
obverse (Kosmetatou 1998).
The following decades were far from peaceful for Eumenes II, as they were marked
by continuous wars with Prusias of Bithynia (187±183) and Pharnakes of Pontos
(183±179). During the Third Macedonian War (171±168) Pergamon fought again
on the side of Rome, but towards its end Eumenes incurred Roman displeasure which
was displayed, among other things, in the Senate's declaration of Galatian autonomy
(Polyb. 30.19; 30.28; Livy Per. 46; Just. 38.6.4). Although Pergamon never suffered
the Rhodian fate of losing its political independence and commercial supremacy in
the Mediterranean, and Eumenes' master ful manoeuvres managed to stabilize his
relationship with Rome, the Pergamene alliance with the Romans remained unequal
to the end of the Attalid dynasty. Gruen is probably correct to question the com
monly held, and perhaps oversimplified, opinion that during the last decade of his
reign Eumenes II held his position at the pleasure of the Roman senate, no longer
able to formulate his own policies (Gruen 1984: 573±5; 2000: 17±18). Although
Eumenes openly acknowledged Rome's hand in the expansion of his kingdom,
he never theless conducted his own wars by his own initiative, made his own settle
ments and concluded his own alliances. He married Stratonike, the daughter of the
Cappadocian king Ariarathes IV, a former enemy of the Romans who wished to
ingratiate himself with the new superpower, and even openly schemed against his
neighbours (Jonnes and Ricl 1997; Ma 1999: 248; Gruen 2000: 19±20). He in
volved himself in the dynastic conflicts of the Seleukid kingdom by helping Antiochos
IV onto the Syrian throne, a policy that his brother Attalos II later favoured as well,
when he promoted the interests of the pretender Alexander Balas in 153 (Gruen
1984: 646±68). Attalid intrigue and the quest for larger territor y, rather than true
love, may have been the motive behind the marriage of Eumenes' youngest brother
Athenaios to Kallipa, former mistress of Perseus, the last king of Macedon (Diod.
32.15.5). The Pergamene king had been especially interested in Thrace ± his ambi
tions may have included par ts of Macedonia as well ± and he had noticed that his
brother Athenaios, one of Pergamon's most competent diplomats, had been a par
ticular favourite with the Romans (cf. Gruen 1984: 562). Although our sources are
scarce and ambiguous, Eumenes' insatiable appetite for territor y and his apparent
desire to expand his kingdom westward may have alarmed the Romans and some
Greeks, leading them to suspect the Pergamene of wishing to fill the power gap left by
the collapse of the Macedonian kingdom.
In the decades following the Peace of Apameia Eumenes II embarked on a lavish
building programme, transforming Pergamon into one of the showpieces of the Hell
enistic world. He extended the sanctuar y of Athena Nikephoros and refounded the
Nikephoria festival in 181 which acquired panhellenic status (C. Jones 1974; 2000).
He also expanded the famous Librar y of Pergamon which was probably founded by
his father Attalos I and was second only to that of Alexandria (Nagy 1998). It was
perhaps in the late 180s that construction of the magnificent and breathtaking Great
Altar began; it featured a dramatic Gigantomachy frieze which ran along the outside
164 Elizabeth Kosmetatou



of the building's base, depicting the str uggle of gods against monstrous giants (cf.
figure 29.2), and a second, smaller frieze around its internal cour tyard narrating the
life and deeds of the hero Telephos, the legendar y forefather of the Attalid dynasty.
Although the Great Altar is considered by most scholars as the crown of Hellenistic
ar t, we know surprisingly little about it. The only sur viving ancient author to mention
it is Ampelius (8.14). We do not know to whom it was dedicated, when exactly it was
built, its purpose or its impact on ar tistic developments of the period, while its
reconstr uction remains a matter of fierce debate among ar t and architectural histor
ians. However, scholars agree that the popular Gigantomachy theme probably sym
bolized Attalid victories against the Galatians and functioned as a symbol of the
str uggle of good vs. evil and the forces of civilization vs. the `barbarians' (Hoepfner
1996; KÈ astner and Heilmeyer 1997; Ridgway 2000a: 19±102; Stewar t 2000).
Although Attalos I and his successors had envisaged the Pergamene and Roman
alliance as a relationship of equals, a bilateral par tnership based on their shared values
of Greek civilization, it became apparent during the reign of Attalos II that this pact
had turned into a one-way dependency of the Pergamene kingdom on the goodwill
of Rome. Attalos II continued most of his brother's policies, but mainly focused on
keeping his kingdom together rather than enter taining ambitions for fur ther expan
sion. He maintained his alliance with Cappadocia and Syria and in the 140s suppor ted
Rome's wars against the Macedonian pretender Andriskos and against Corinth. He
also kept up the Pergamene tradition of of fering magnificent gifts to impor tant Greek
allied cities like Athens, where he built at least one stoa (Hopp 1977: 57±106; Gr uen
1984: 584±92; J. Engels 1999: 286±9).
After a long reign of twenty years, Attalos II was succeeded by Eumenes II's son,
Attalos III (138±133), but sources for his reign are scarce and confusing. Ancient
authors describe him as a br utal, eccentric, unpopular king who was uninterested in
gover ning, loved his mother pathologically and was consumed by the study of botany
and pharmacology. Never theless, he must have been a competent student in his
chosen disciplines, since none other than Galen speaks admiringly of his achievements
(Diod. 34.3; Just. 36.4.1±5; Gal.
Comp. Med. Gen
. 13.416). Moreover, the sur viving
epigraphic evidence, which includes information on his cultic benefactions and at
least one militar y success, show him in a favourable light. Even though of ficial
documents usually present us with a `par ty-line' of sor ts, Attalos III seems to have
retained cordial relations with the Romans, and there is no information on internal
strife in the kingdom during his reign. At any rate, his premature death in 133 star ted
a chain reaction of events that eventually led to Roman suzerainty in Asia Minor.
Possibly faced with a dynastic challenge initiated by Aristonikos, who claimed to be a
bastard son of Eumenes II, the childless Attalos bequeathed his kingdom to Rome.
His will may have been modelled on that of Ptolemy VIII Physkon, but it definitely
came as a natural consequence of political and militar y developments that had begun
many decades before (Hopp 1977: 107±47; Gr uen 1984: 592±610; J. Engels 1999:
292±7).
An emergency situation arose immediately after Attalos III's death before Rome
could react to news of the will. Proclaiming Eumenes II as his father, Aristonikos
organized a rebellion which initially met with some success. He promptly took the
diadem, assumed the name of Eumenes III and issued cistophoric coinage from
the mints of Thyateira, Apollonis and Stratonikeia (Robinson 1954). Faced with
The Attalids of Pergamon
165



the fierce opposition of city-states and of the kings of Bithynia, Pontos, Cappadocia
and Paphlagonia, who naturally aimed at car ving up the Pergamene kingdom, and
after suf fering a heavy naval defeat, he recruited slaves. Although his suppor ters were
fighting against the professional, formidable and disciplined Roman army, they
never theless scored significant successes, until they were finally defeated in 130.
Aristonikos himself was captured and led away to execution in a Roman prison.
Judging western Asia Minor as too unstable, the Roman senate assumed responsi
bility for its security, restored law and order, organized its reconstruction and im
posed a settlement among the powers of the region. The Attalid treasur y and royal
estates had already been bequeathed to Rome, and the eventual annexation of the
entire region was a natural consequence of continuous Roman involvement in the
area over a long period of time (Gruen 1984: 596±608; Hopp 1977: 135±47; Mileta
1998; McGing, this volume, section 4).
3 The Public and Political Image of the Attalids
Much has been written on the largely successful ef forts of the Attalids to cast a
shadow over their dubious origins with a blaze of cultural glor y, rivalling Classical
Athens (Schalles 1985; Gruen 2000). Sur viving and/or presumed Attalid monu
ments have been analysed to destruction, and this chapter will not dwell on the
problems associated with the reconstruction of the infamous Attalid sculptural dedi
cations. Emphasis will be given instead to the fundamentals of Attalid image-making
by exploring and evaluating a number of themes prevalent in the construction of
Pergamene ideology.
A first priority which was consistently assumed as such by all Attalid rulers was the
creation of the ideal leader, a type that they endeavoured to fit. As Murray Edelman
has obser ved leadership in this sense can be associated with dramaturgy, and he has
stressed that `regardless of the consequences of of ficials' actions, which contemporar
ies cannot know, the ability to create oneself as the ideal type maintains followings'
(1988: 40). The Attalids undoubtedly maintained a following through the ages ±
even though the impact of their propaganda continuously changes with the times ±
since their reputation remains pristine to this day, and they are continuously credited
by art historians as instrumental agents in setting the style and as great innovators (cf.
Savalli-Lestrade 2001: 78). It is true that dramaturgy has become more impor tant
and relevant in our modern age of mass communication and flood of information,
but theatricality and the staging of public life occupied a central position in the
Hellenistic world. It allowed the central players ± individuals such as kings, or groups,
such as the various leagues of cities ± to construct an image of themselves which
deceived par tly because it distor ted reality, constructed illusions and controlled the
emotions and thoughts of the public (Chaniotis 1997a).
Theatricality was an integral element of Hellenistic public life and played an
impor tant role in political attempts to control the emotive responses and af fect
audiences' attitudes towards the powers that be. It would be a mistake, however, to
associate theatricality exclusively with high drama as displayed in the architecture,
town planning and ar t of the period (Pollitt 1986: 230±49). The concept itself is an
impor tant theme in Attalid dynastic propaganda, but it bears no relation to grand
`theatrical' per formances in public life, along the lines of the spectacular procession of
166 Elizabeth Kosmetatou



Ptolemy II Philadelphos (Athen. 5.196a±203e). Attalid actions were never exagger
atedly massive, nor did they of fer great thrills to their audiences, because subtlety was
their motto and this turned out to be more ef fective in the long run. In choosing this
policy the Pergamene rulers probably took into account the peculiarities of their own
rise to power and their family's dif ference in situation, it being so decidedly beneath
the glamorous origins of the Diadochoi.
First, it was necessar y to clean up their own origins, and this problem was taken
care of, probably by Eumenes I and Attalos I. A fragmentar y inscription from
Pergamon, dated to the Roman period, informs us that a sufficiently aristocratic
pedigree was attached to the Attalids who were thus incorporated into the geneal
ogies of the previous masters of Pergamon (OGIS 264). Rather than attempt to hide
the fact that Philetairos was a eunuch, with all its demeaning associations of slaver y
and sexual exploitation, his successors boldly put him for ward as a founding father,
whose por trait graced Attalid coinage continuously for more than seventy years. A sad
stor y was attached to his fate. He supposedly became a eunuch as a result of a tragic
accident. While still an infant, Philetairos was taken by his nurse to a large funeral.
Caught in a terrible crowd, he was crushed! In a flash of genius, the family realized
that the only career option open for the thus cruelly incapacitated Philetairos was to
be trained among other eunuchs as a royal administrator. This unlikely stor y is
narrated by Strabo (13.4) who mainly used pro-Attalid sources in relating the histor y
of the kingdom of Pergamon.
Next, it was essential for the Attalids to construct a state mythology which would
rival the religious policies of other Hellenistic kingdoms and would allow the Perga
mene rulers to fabricate much-needed fictional dynastic and legendar y genealogies. It
would also establish a link with Alexander the Great who often figured in Hellenistic
royal propaganda. The Attalids could not claim to be the long-lost illegitimate
descendants of Philip II, as Ptolemy I had attempted in his early years as king
(Cur t. 9.8.22; Paus. 1.6.2), but they were somehow lucky in their obscurity. For a
shor t while in the late four th centur y Pergamon had been the seat of Herakles, son of
Alexander the Great and Barsine, before mother and son were murdered by Poly
perchon who thus put an end to their claims over Alexander's empire (Kosmetatou
1995; 2000: 45±6). The Attalids could, therefore, present themselves as the legitim
ate successors of this Herakles. Their new mythology reinforced this link: the Arka
dian hero Telephos was adopted as the dynasty's legendar y forefather. He was the son
of Auge, an Arkadian princess who was seduced by the hero Herakles and cast away by
her father. She gave bir th to Telephos in Mysian Teuthrania, over which region the
hero reigned. Telephos featured in legends related to the Trojan war: the wandering
Achaians landed in Mysia on their way to Troy and plundered the area, until they
were stopped by Telephos and his troops who defended the countr y. The hero was
wounded by Achilles in battle and could only find relief by going to Greece, black
mailing the Achaians into providing a cure, and leading them to Troy in return
(Stewar t 1996b; Gruen 2000). Interestingly, Telephos' sons by the name of Tarchon
and Tarsenos (and perhaps Eur ypylos as well) sided with the Trojans against the
Greeks, an aspect of the stor y that played an impor tant role later.
In choosing Telephos as legendar y forefather, the Attalids established a link with
his father Herakles, the legendar y patriarch of the Argead dynasty of Macedon, to
which Alexander the Great and Philip II belonged. Fur ther mythical origins had to be
The Attalids of Pergamon 167



established, however, which would link the Attalids more closely to Alexander the
Great. Following the well-established practice of Greek cities to assign themselves a
real or fictitious eponymous ktistes, and favoured by the name of their capital which
of fered a lot of possibilities, the Attalids chose Pergamos, a ver y marginal hero, as
their own legendar y founder. Pergamos was one of the sons of Andromache and
Neoptolemos, son of Achilles. According to legend, he became king of the Epeirote
tribe of the Molossians and eventually ended up in Mysia in response to an invitation
of Gr ynos, grandson of Telephos. Pergamos distinguished himself in war, killed the
king of Teuthrania, renamed his capital after himself and ruled. The Attalids did not
use his myth in their state mythology ver y much. The archaeological record suggests
that at least one small heroon, dedicated to Pergamos Ktistes, was built in Pergamon,
probably in the third centur y, and his head with the same legend occurs on some
bronze coins of the Roman Imperial period. However, the hero Pergamos played a
role in Attalid state propaganda by providing fur ther links to Alexander the Great and
by associating the Attalid dynasty with the royal families of Epeiros and therefore with
Olympias, the mother of the Macedonian conqueror. Next, Pergamos' name, which
he supposedly gave to his capital, conveniently provided a further association between
the Attalid capital and Troy, a city that Homer on occasion also calls Pergamon
(Kosmetatou 1995; for fur ther discussion of mythology and Pergamene traditions,
see Scheer, this volume).
An impor tant element in the creation of the Attalid image was the construction of
leaders who possessed qualities that their contemporar y rulers lacked. These were, of
course, the proverbial Attalid family values. All ancient authors agree on this point:
the Attalid family was always united, no feuds ever took place and ever y member of
the family wholehear tedly suppor ted the reigning monarch, who invariably followed
on the footsteps of his predecessors and implemented the same, consistent policy
that had been formulated since the foundation of the Attalid kingdom (Polyb.
23.11.7±8). This practice was sharply contrasted to the infamous family feuds that
repeatedly broke out in other Hellenistic monarchies. Attalos I's image as a family
man who married Apollonis, a simple girl from Kyzikos, for love, never cheated on
her and became a most vir tuous father (Polyb. 18.41) was sharply juxtaposed in the
minds of Hellenistic audiences to the Ptolemaic sibling marriage that initially shocked
the Greeks and the ensuing murderous habits of these monarchs against members of
their own family (Carney 1987). Apollonis, Attalos' wife, was credited with rising to
the occasion of her unexpected acquisition of royal status and with teaching her
children the impor tance of family values (Polyb. 22.20). This image of a strong, per
petually united family cer tainly influenced Polybios in his assessment of the Attalids,
as well as modern scholars. In discussing the enigmatic philosopher Daphitas, who
was repor tedly executed by an other wise unidentified Attalos for writing jeering
verses against the Attalids, Fontenrose cites Attalos I's character, including his rela
tions with his wife and sons, to reject any involvement of this `wise and just king' in
such a horrible and unreasonable act (1960: 85±6)!
While the successful collaboration between Attalos I and Apollonis' four sons is not
a matter of dispute among historians, Eumenes II and his brother, the later Attalos II,
knew the impor tance of carefully staging a royal appearance that would bring glor y
and renown to the dynasty. Eumenes II is said to have appeared in public surrounded
by his brothers in the guise of bodyguards, a scene that the Alexandrians would surely
168 Elizabeth Kosmetatou



never witness during the turbulent reigns of Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VIII (Plut.Mor.
480c). At any rate, this impressive scene left a significant mark on the Greeks to the
extent that Polybios used it in his por trayal of Philip V of Macedon as tragic hero. In a
manner that echoed Aeschylus' Persians, in which the poet chose to glorify the deeds
of the Greeks in the Persian wars by having their enemies praise them, Philip V in
Polybios' histor y pays tribute to his enemies, the Attalids, by underlying the unity of
their family as instrumental to the preser vation and expansion of their rule. Philip
bitterly juxtaposes the proverbial Attalid brotherly love to the hatred among his sons
that brought down his own kingdom (Polyb. 23.11; Haegemans and Kosmetatou
2002).
Fur thermore, promoting their mother as the uniting force of the royal family
became an impor tant policy: Eumenes II, Attalos II and Apollonis famously visited
the latter's native city of Kyzikos around 185. The two sons made a carefully staged
public appearance, framing their mother and holding both her hands during their
tour of the city's public buildings. This visit was surely supposed to remind spectators
of the most famous sons of Greek histor y, Kleobis and Biton, whose legend was
narrated by Herodotos (Hdt. 1.31; Polyb. 22.20; Walbank 1979a: 211; Chaniotis
1997a: 239), and it may have inspired the later construction of a temple to the
dowager queen, presumably after her death, whose columns were adorned with reliefs
narrating scenes of filial piety, including the stories of Kleobis and Biton, the Attalid
forbears Dionysos and Telephos, and Roman heroes such as Romulus and Remus
(Anth. Pal. 3.1±19; Kuttner 1995: 168). Even though Eumenes and Attalos acted by
instinct in forming their propaganda, they had understood the following impor tant
principle that modern political psychologists have better formulated: in the context of
ideology, people tend to draw their preferred leader toward their conception of the
ideal which usually corresponds to their own positions and even personal characteris
tics (Granberg 1993: 109±11).
The image that emerges then is that of a vir tuous family with habits to which the
common man could relate. Attalid queens were primarily wives and mothers, involv
ing themselves in the cult of matron goddesses, sponsoring ver y limited architectural
projects and never involving themselves in politics. Their role in dynastic propaganda
was always ver y limited inasmuch as it suppor ted the image of the reigning ruler. It
was a ver y dull cour t, without a whiff of a scandal, which brings to mind the
bourgeois, austere and vir tuous habits of King George III of England, whose excel
lent relationship with his wife and repor ted devotion to his children led ever yone to
consider his as the dullest cour t in Europe. Last, but not least, the Attalid rulers were
never deified during their lifetime, even though they received limited divine honours
(I.Perg. 246; OGIS 332; IG 22 885; Chaniotis, this volume). One may therefore
conclude that they became popular par tly because they appealed to the common man,
while retaining their royal status (Ferguson 1906).
The Pergamene rulers did indeed acquire a reputation as the consummate benefac
tors who catered to the needs of the common man. They provided grain to allied
cities in times of famine and sponsored basic education by paying teachers' salaries
(OGIS 748; SIG
3 671±2; Diod. 31.36; Polyb. 31.31). They also became famous
builders. In his study on architecture Vitruvius (5.9.1) refers to the stoa that Eumenes
II built next to the theatre of Athens, the sole purpose of which was to protect the
audience from sudden showers. Indeed large public utilitarian buildings, mainly
The Attalids of Pergamon 169



stoas, were sponsored by the Attalids for the benefit of the public which duly
appreciated them (Coulton 1976). However, it is notewor thy that these expensive
gifts had cer tain express purposes which they strictly ser ved. Firstly, they marked the
Attalid presence in sanctuaries or major Greek cities such as Delphi and Athens;
secondly, they reinforced existing alliances between the Attalids and specific cities,
as happened in the case of the stoa that was built in Termessos, a gesture that aimed at
exploiting the conflicts between Termessos and its neighbouring Selge, a city which
had been a thorn in the eye of Attalos II in his continuous ef forts to control rebellious
Pisidia (Kosmetatou 1997: 32±3). It seems that the sponsoring of an architectural
project on the par t of Pergamon did not necessarily aim at boosting the local
economy, nor did it provide jobs for the locals. A study of the remains of Eumenes
II's Athenian stoa has demonstrated that the materials, plans, and perhaps even the
ar tists, were provided by Pergamon (Korres 1983). The same thing probably also
happened at Delphi where Attalos I built a stoa close to the temple of Apollo (Scheer,
this volume).
Two more elements in Attalid dynastic propaganda contribute to the building up
of the por trait of leadership. The first involves the construction of historical accounts
relating to the infamous Galatian raids in Greece and Asia Minor; the Attalids are
repeatedly the victorious saviours (Mitchell, this volume). The Gauls probably came
to Asia Minor in 278 and may have been defeated at some point by Philetairos. His
contribution to the war ef for t, however, went beyond the battlefield: according to the
epigraphic record he seized the oppor tunity to contribute to the reconstruction of
cities that were worst hit by the raids (IG 11.1105; OGIS 748). A dramatic increase in
Attalid prestige occurred under Attalos I who pointedly refused to pay tribute to the
Gauls and scored a decisive victor y over them. Somewhat exaggeratedly, he compared
his victor y to the Persian defeat at the hands of the Greeks in the early fifth centur y,
and duly celebrated it by setting up a massive monument on the Athenian Acropolis
depicting famous mythological battles: a Gigantomachy, an Amazonomachy, the
victor y of the Athenians over the Persians at Marathon and his own destruction of
the Gauls. The base of this ver y controversial monument, which may have included as
many as 120 bronze statues, was recently rediscovered in the Acropolis Museum
(Paus. 1.25.2; Wenning 1978; Schalles 1985; Stewart 2004). Subsequent Attalid
victories against the Gauls were likewise celebrated in Pergamon, Delos and else
where, to the extent that the brief testimony of ancient authors like Pliny and
Pausanias has led many modern scholars to associate any sculptural depiction of
victories over barbarians or Gauls with the Attalid patronage (Pliny HN 34.84.2;
Ridgway 1990: 275±312; Marszal 1998; 2000). Upon closer examination of the
evidence, however, it becomes clear that the Attalids were rather more successful than
other contemporar y victors over the Gauls in advertising their achievement. The
Aitolians cer tainly fought against the Gauls in the third centur y in their attempt to
protect Delphi. So too did Antigonos Gonatas, the Seleukid kings and even Ptolemy
II (Nachtergael 1977). Some of these even adver tised their victories: Callimachus
mentions the Ptolemaic victor y in his Hymn to Delos (v. 185±7), Gallic shields were
featured on Ptolemaic coinage, and there is some evidence that monuments were
erected. Recently, Barbantani made a case for the association of two fragmentar y
elegiac poems preser ved on papyri with Ptolemaic battles. Significantly, the second
poem (SH 958) uses the same association of the Galatians and the Persians at
170 Elizabeth Kosmetatou



Marathon (490 B C ) that was used as a theme in Attalos I's propaganda (Barbantani
2001).
Royal victories over the Gauls should not be regarded in such a simplistic way,
however. Upon closer examination of the events surrounding the majority of these
skirmishes, a link can be found between the Gallic threat as a real problem for
autonomous city-states and attempts by the powers of the time to counteract it. In
this context, the Attalids appeared as the champions of the Greeks who tirelessly
sought a way to cope with their problems. In most cases, however, these same
Hellenistic kings were the agents responsible for the presence, and raids, of the
Gauls in the first place, since the Gauls were used as mercenaries as a matter of course
in royal armies (Mitchell, this volume). They were formidable warriors, but unreliable
in their loyalty, as they often revolted and subsequently raided various areas causing
mayhem. One example will suffice: During his conflict with the Seleukid general
Achaios, and while he was wooing allies in the Troad, Attalos had to deal with
indiscipline among his Galatian Aigosages mercenar y troops that he had brought
from Europe, presumably Thrace. He was faced with three dif ficult choices: First, he
could simply let them go, in which case they might have joined Achaios against him.
A second, more radical solution dictated their treacherous slaughter by his other,
more reliable, troops, thereby assuring himself of notoriety and a reputation as an
unreliable employer. He chose the lesser of the three evils, often chosen by other
militar y commanders, and the only one that had a chance of working by promising to
return them to their original home, grant them land for a settlement and attend to
their requests. The first promise was probably not carried out, because Polybios
expressly repor ts that the Galatian Aigosagoi were settled somewhere along the
coast of the Hellespont (5.78.5). His next reference to Attalos' negotiations with
Lampsakos, Alexandria Troas and Ilion may suggest that the king came to an
understanding with these impor tant cities, who therefore allowed the foundation of
this settlement in their neighbourhood. They were soon to regret it. The Galatians
did not show any inclination towards farming, a peaceful life and the forging of
neighbourly ties, nor did they show any interest in integrating themselves into the
region. They chose instead the usual career that the literar y sources so often associ
ated with them ± that of marauders. The silence of the ancient sources about any
hostility on the par t of the cities of the Troad towards Attalos I, who brought these
troops to the area in the first place, suggests that the local population could under
stand and appreciate the king's ef for t to fight of f Achaios that kept him continuously
occupied for the next year. They may also have been bribed into siding with him, of
course. The Pergamene king probably somehow helped the cities of the Troad to
respond ef fectively to the threat, most likely by financing par t of their campaign. It
may have been around that time that Ilion expressed its gratitude to Attalos by
naming one of its tribes after him, an honour that it had previously bestowed only
on Alexander the Great. A solution to the continuous Galatian raids in the region was
of fered by King Prusias of Bithynia who eventually scored a formidable defeat against
them and showed considerable cruelty by slaughtering them all (Kosmetatou 2001).
Victories against the Gauls could therefore become grossly exaggerated, taken out
of their original context, and reinterpreted as examples of royal militar y prowess. Still,
ancient authors tended to disregard the circumstances surrounding most of these
raids and did not acknowledge the responsibility of the glowing victors who brought
The Attalids of Pergamon 171



the Gauls into the area in the first place. One more impor tant aspect of the celebra
tion of Gallic victories by the setting up of public victor y monuments was to diver t
the public's attention from the fact that some of these battles basically took place in
the context of a war where Greeks fought against Greeks, and rather focus on the
annihilation of the `barbarian' mercenar y troops at the ser vice of their enemy.
Lastly, Attalid propaganda focused on providing a rationale for cer tain controver
sial choices in Pergamene policy, in par ticular what the Greeks perceived as an Attalid
alliance with the Romans against fellow Greeks. Towards the end of the third centur y
Attalos I sought the help of independent Greek cities and leagues, as well as the
Romans, with a view to guaranteeing his own sur vival and checking once and for all
any Macedonian and Syrian aggression, real or presumed. The strategy followed
was simple, time-honoured and ef fective: a cer tain, not necessarily deceptive and
false, problem was linked to a constructed solution. In this case the problem of
Macedonian and Syrian aggression could be tackled by a declaration of war, the
course of action favoured by the Attalids; to achieve this they exaggerated the
problem and provoked existing fears, thus maximizing the suppor t from their allies.
In order to arouse public interest and influence the foreign policy of the Hellenistic
world, Attalos I, and his sons after him, appealed to ver y specific concerns. The
Romans had recently emerged victorious following a ver y dif ficult struggle with
Hannibal and were extremely apprehensive of future aggression coming from the
East. The Greek city-states had been traumatized by past experiences with Macedon,
and a subsequent rapprochement between Macedon and Syria rattled ner ves across
the region. All this was suitable material for exploitation; on later occasions, such as
the propaganda campaign against Perseus, other anxieties could be stirred.
At any rate, even though many cities of fered their suppor t to the Attalid cause,
the Macedonian Wars, as well as the eventual defeat and breakdown of the Seleukid
and Macedonian kingdoms, did not go down well with the Greeks. A debate arose on
the origins of the Romans whom some Greeks declared as kinsmen (Gruen 1992: 6±
21). Pergamon had been the chief ally of the Romans, and the main aim of Perga
mene foreign policy was the expansion of their kingdom at the expense of Syria and
preferably Macedon as well. In this context, the Attalids, anxious to refute anyone
who dismissed the Romans as barbarians (Derow, this volume), adopted a strategy
that would persuade the Hellenistic world that the Romans were really Greeks, or at
least closely associated with the Greek legendar y past. These views are echoed in later
authors who deal in par t with the question of the Greeks in the Roman world.
Mythology was again used in order to suggest that the Attalids and the Romans
were kinsmen, and that their alliance was therefore natural and justified. As the
Roman elite showed a vivid interest in ever ything Greek at the time and were eager
to become par t of the sophisticated East, the Attalids also sought to cater to Roman
cultural insecurities, thereby securing more benefits from their all-power ful allies.
This policy may be reflected in one of the more enigmatic literar y works to sur vive
from the Hellenistic period, the Alexandra attributed to L ykophron of Chalkis
(Kosmetatou 2000; contrast Erskine 2001: 152±6). This poem has the length of a
tragedy and the form of an inflated tragic messenger's speech. The action takes place
on the day of the depar ture of Paris for Greece and for the rape of Helen, during
which an unnamed slave of King Priam of Troy repor ts to his master the incompre
hensible prophecies of his daughter Kassandra, after whose obscure name, Alexandra,
172 Elizabeth Kosmetatou



the poem is named. The prophetess predicts the Trojan War and its aftermath, and
amidst a formidable and over whelming quantity of, mostly rare, myths, whose
protagonists are never disclosed directly, she foretells the evils that would befall
both the Trojans and, especially, the victorious Greeks as a result. The prophecies
culminate in a narration of the Italian adventures of various Homeric heroes on their
way home from Troy and of the eventual triumph of the Romans who claimed
descent from the Trojans. In par ticular, a cer tain passage has been plausibly inter
preted as referring to the Roman general T. Quinctius Flamininus, the victor over
Philip V at Kynoskephalai in 197 (v. 1446±50). The poet also mentions a cer tain
alliance presumably between Flamininus and a cer tain descendant of Alexander the
Great, through his son Herakles, who also boasts Trojan ties (v. 799±804). Since
Pergamene mythology par tly focused on the association of Pergamon with the Trojan
legend, the Attalids are the only Hellenistic rulers to fit the description of Flamininus'
ally. Arguing in favour of this theor y is L ykophron's apparent incorporation of a
number of myths that clearly belonged to the Attalid `state mythology', including the
adventures of Telephos, and especially his sons who travelled with Aeneas to Italy and
became forefathers of local populations. This type of Attalid ideological mythography
structured many Roman myths: Dionysios of Halikarnassos mentions that Italy was
colonized by various groups of Greeks, including Pelasgians, Arkadians and Pelopon
nesians from Elis (Ant. Rom. 1.17±31). Significantly, the Trojans, the legendar y
forefathers of the Romans, were presumed to come from Arkadia, just like the Attalid
Telephidai (C. Jones 1995: 240). Echoes of Attalid influence on the Roman mytho
logical tradition may also be found, as Hardie has argued, in major iconographies in
Virgil's Aeneid that may have been initially structured by Attalid ideological mythog
raphy (Hardie 1986: 85±156). Kuttner has also recently studied possible Roman
republican responses to Hellenistic Pergamon, and this type of research deser ves to be
fur ther pursued as it opens new avenues for in-depth analyses and an increase in our
understanding of early Roman±Greek relations (Kuttner 1995).
4 Conclusion
Like many successful leaders the Attalids were able to manipulate political controversy
and manoeuvre in such a way as to impose a cer tain interpretation of their actions and
policies. They were able to present themselves as benevolent, enlightened, true
successors to Alexander's legacy, rather than authoritarian rulers. Their wars were
just, rather than aggressive; they had the public interest, especially the freedom of the
Greeks, at hear t; and they belonged to the giant players of the period following an
alliance with Rome that was justified on the basis of political developments and
the mutual understanding between the two presumed kinsmen ± the Roman and
Pergamene peoples. One could argue that just as the qualities of leaders are con
structed, so too are beliefs about the successes and failures of their policies, precisely
because these judgements depend on the interpretation and ideological definitions of
the issues. We may therefore perhaps conclude that the Attalids were not successful in
their endeavours: they constantly fought wars and never controlled their expanded
kingdom in its entirety, but only imposed their rule on par ts of it, while their
supposed bilateral alliance with Rome became a one-way dependency of the kingdom
which eventually rever ted to its real masters, brought to Asia Minor, after all, by the
The Attalids of Pergamon 173



ambitious and manipulating Attalids themselves. However, this is not the prevailing
assessment of the Attalids in the ancient sources, and this view often influences our
assessment of Pergamon in these our modern times as well, when their propaganda
still works because it is based on simple, timeless r ules, and their monuments still
glitter, making this the most photogenic and appealing dynasty of all.
FURTHER READING
The main ancient source on the lives and deeds of the Attalids remains Polybios,
although Strabo discusses their reigns as well, mainly using sources that were friendly
to the Pergamene kings. Our reconstr uction of the histor y of the kingdom of
Pergamon generally relies equally on the primar y sources, ancient historiography,
the epigraphical evidence and the archaeological record. The secondar y literature on
Pergamon is enormous. E. V. Hansen's The Attalids of Pergamon (1971) remains the
most comprehensive, if somewhat outdated, study, long surpassed by epigraphical
discoveries and many specialized studies by modern scholars, including impor tant
works on Attalid coinage and finances. Hopp's 1977 book on the late Attalids
remains a classic, however. Gr uen 1984: 529±610 treats Attalid relations with
Rome; Allen 1983 focuses more on the administration of the kingdom. In the last
decade or so, a par ticularly welcome revision of traditional theories on the Attalids,
especially their cultural policies, has been under taken by a number of scholars. The
most impor tant aspect of these works is the happy collaboration and dialogue
between prominent researchers on Pergamon, after a par ticularly long period which
saw the recycling of the same theories on Pergamene sculpture that most resembled a
house of cards, and whose formulation sometimes violated the r ules of critical
thinking. The best star ting points for the study of the Attalids and their capital
would therefore be: Dreyfus and Schraudolph 1996; Koester 1998, from which one
should single out the ver y impor tant ar ticle by W. Radt, director of the Pergamon
excavations, that sums up recent field research in the area; and de Gr ummond and
Ridgway 2000. For the debate about the nature of Attalid ar t and its influence one

PART III
Change and Continuity






CHAPTER ELEVEN
Kings
John Ma
1 Introduction: in Search of Unity
Take one par ticular, relatively well documented case, a par ticular king in this age of
kings: Antiochos III, the Great (Megas), the `Great King' of the Seleukid realm (regn.
223±186). Here are some moments in his long reign. Antiochos in the ancient Ionian
polis, Teos: entering the town with royal Friends and troops, giving a speech before
the ekklesia, proclaiming the city `holy and inviolate and free from tribute', as
confirmed in a follow-up inter view and celebrated by the Teians in a long epigraphical
dossier (c. 203). Antiochos III in Babylon (187): sacrificing and prostrating himself in
the great temple of Marduk, the Esagil, appearing before the assembled Babylonians,
being presented with `a golden crown. . . a golden box of Beltiya, and the purple
garment of King Nebuchadnezzar'. Quite dif ferent the impression from Antiochos
III in Elymais, the following year: marching East, plundering a local shrine, slaugh
tered in a night attack launched on his camp by the local population in revenge for the
spoliation. We could yet multiply such images: young Antiochos on his morning
constitutional, retiring to relieve himself, taking his time while his Friends knife to
death a troublesome but solidly entrenched minister; shor tly after, Antiochos marr y
ing his Pontic bride at Zeugma, the city on the Euphrates crossing; dancing in arms
and listening to hexameter verse (if not quite at the same time, at least at the same
feast); the thir ty-year old king deciding in royal council how the usurper, his cousin,
will die (ears and nose sliced of f, decapitated, the head sewn into a donkey hide and
the body impaled atop Mt. Tmolos); the fifty-year-old king marr ying an eighteen
year-old beauty from Chalkis, and renaming her `Euboia', perhaps implying that he is
taking the land as well as the girl; camping in the Hindu Kush; sacrificing at Delphi;
the militar y leader campaigning against troops of Ptolemy IV and Ptolemy V, Attalos
I, Philip V, against rebels in his kingdom (including his uncle), against Par thians,
Baktrians, Pisidians, Thracians, and finally Romans (why them?); personally and
rashly leading cavalr y charges, as he did in at least three major battles (two of which
he duly lost); receiving a mouth wound and losing some teeth in hand to hand
combat during one of these charges, in Baktria; in Baktria still, meeting with the



Figure 11.1
Before and after: Hellenistic kingship is good for your hair. This head of Attalos
I, ruler of the Pergamon-centred principality, was reworked to accommodate a stone `wig' of
carefully swirling locks, complete with royal diadem. The change occurred when Attalos I took
the title of king (some time in the 230s), and expresses the godlike, impressive, `charismatic'
image that was the visible shape of Hellenistic kingship: Smith 1988, 79±81 (the photographs
are taken from Alter tu Èmer von Pergamon, Vol. 7, plates 31±2)
son of an opponent and judging him worthy of the royal title, by demeanour (an act
of royal styling, but one which covered and resolved a ver y real militar y stalemate);
Antiochos himself being judged kingly, on his return from a six-year long armed tour
in the Eastern regions of the Seleukid empire. These items (hardly exhausting the
variety of Antiochos' life) are derived from the literar y and epigraphical material
(Schmitt 1964; Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993; Ma 1999); if we wanted a visual
image, we could turn to a fine sculpted head in the Louvre, which probably represents
Antiochos III, with a specific choice among all the possible elements in the vocabular y
of royal representation: hard, active, dynamic (Smith 1988). But will the real Anti
ochos please stand up?
Antiochos III is not unique in the diversity of images available for his exercise of
kingship; a similar collage could be given for many other Hellenistic rulers, drawn
from other dynasties (for instance the Ptolemies, or the smaller kingdoms of Bithynia,
Pontos, Cappadocia). The evidence was always plentiful, and has recently multiplied
remarkably, thanks to epigraphical finds (notably in Asia Minor, for the Seleukids and
especially the Attalids). Scholars have studied individual dynasties (notably the Anti
gonids) or individual kings; most impor tantly, they multiplied the viewpoints on
Hellenistic kingship: the Near-Eastern dimension of the Seleukid empire, argued
for by A. Kuhr t and S. Sher win-White (but see Austin, this volume, for a cautious
view); the interaction between Ptolemies and Egyptian priests (see Thompson, this
volume); the institutions of the royal state (Billows 1995; Savalli-Lestrade 1998); the
role of images in projecting royal ideology to dif ferent audiences (Smith 1988); ruler
178 John Ma



cult as a phenomenon of interaction between king and subject, but also as a way for
Greek cities to come to terms with a supra-poliadic power (S. Price 1984); kingship as
a discursive, per formative phenomenon, manifested in speech-act (Ber trand 1990;
Ma 1999); the Achaimenid model of kingship, deeply influential (Briant 1996).
These are only a few of the recent developments in studies of Hellenistic kings, but
they determine the scope of the present, selective, essay on the theme.
The increase in available evidence, the elaboration of new concepts and models and
our sharpened awareness for the diverse nature of Hellenistic kingship make writing
about the phenomenon much more challenging, if much more interesting (Gr uen
1996). As for the rest of the Hellenistic period, we can no longer mingle por tentous
clich Â es, tralatician statements and quotations from a rather small body of ancient
texts. I might give the following dictionnaire des ide Â es rec Ë ues, telegraphically con
densed in the interests of brevity and caricature. Kingship alien and abhorrent to
Greeks (polis, Herodotos, Athenian democracy). Alexander (deep and unique impact
of). Personal monarchy (not kings of but . . . in Egypt!) But Antigonid exception?
Hardly. Plutarch, Demetrios. Militar y monarchy (compulsor y quote: Suda s.v. basi
leia). Nomos empsuchos (see also `glorious slaver y', Peri basileias treatises). Institu
tionalized charisma (deinos, other adjectives transcribed from the Greek into English,
tr uncated quotations, etc.), patrimonial state, power theor y (here, according to age
of scholar and date of piece, quote homeopathic doses of M. Weber, M. Foucault,
C. Geer tz, P. Bourdieu). Patronage, euergetism, r uler cult (compulsor y tut-tutting
quote: Athenian ithyphallic hymn for Demetrios Poliorketes).
None of these elements is necessarily false or misleading, and they underpin useful
accounts, even recent ones (e.g. Ma 1999, and this volume). However, they will not
determine the present essay: the insistence on diversity in recent work on Hellenistic
kingship requires a broadening of horizons to accommodate the plurality of the
phenomenon. The topic is an impor tant one: one does not need to subscribe to
the ill-documented, recurrent but rhetorically and heuristically useful clich Âeabout the
`end of the polis' in the Hellenistic world to recognize the following few points about
the period. The kings and their states extended both to the ancient near-east and the
Greek world a system of competing imperial states, a situation which had disappeared
in the near-east with the emergence of the unitar y world empire of the Achaimenids.
The kingdoms were the dominant forces in high political histor y of the period; they
developed power ful concrete and ideological forms to express their dominance.
These forms are the subject of this chapter: I wish to sur vey the diversity of inter
actions, but also argue that diversity was subsumed within an imperial discourse
where local multiplicity could be made to speak of unity and dominance. This analysis
is derived from P. Briant's analyses of the Achaimenid empire; which is hardly
surprising, since the strategies deployed by the Hellenistic kings were inherited
from the Achaimenids, an aspect of continuity which Briant himself has emphasized.
2 Local Interlocutors: Interaction and Role Assignment
Kings appeared in a diversity of local roles and under a diversity of local images,
interacting with communities, elites and traditions in the various areas they r uled
(Herz 1996). This chameleon quality is strikingly illustrated by the images that have
sur vived for the kings in non-Greek regions, where, without speaking the actual
Kings 179



languages, Ptolemies and Seleukids were recast in local idioms of kingship, especially
religious. In Egypt, the king interacted with the shrines and the priestly elites, notably
in Memphis: patronage, visits, sacrifice, building activity, par ticipation in ritual activ
ity intensified with time; the Ptolemaic king, in interacting with the Egyptian priests,
appeared as pharaoh (Peremans 1987; D. J. Thompson 1988, 1990; Koenen 1993;
cf. figure 7.2). In return for kingly acts of beneficence (perceived or proclaimed: gift,
victor y, amnesty), the Egyptian priests, meeting in assemblies (`synods'), decided on
various gestures of praise for the king, named with pharaonic (or pharaoh-like) titles.
The resulting decisions were published in hieroglyphic and demotic (as well as
Greek): the famous Rosetta stone bears one such document (the `Memphis decree'
passed in 196 for Ptolemy V). The synod decrees make clear that interaction between
Ptolemies and priests generated material manifestations, again in local idioms: build
ing in the temples, and the production of images of the kings in traditional pharaonic
guise. Recent archaeological activity in Alexandria, notably around the Pharos, seems
to indicate that monumental statuar y in Egyptian style was widespread even in that
city, a foundation of Alexander (and hence, according to our categories, a `Greek'
city) and the centre of power. Two colossal statues, lately found under water, of
(perhaps) Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II once stood in front of the Pharos: Egyptian by
size, hard-stone material and visual style, they seem to imply that an Egyptian visual
style was adopted as par t of the vocabular y of kingship early on and quite openly
(Bagnall 2001: 229±30; the statues were reassembled outside the Petit Palais in Paris
in 1998; they now stand outside the modern Bibliotheca Alexandrina).
The other example that has been studied and pondered in detail is the Seleukid
interaction with temple and city in Babylonia, where the king presented himself as
`the king of the world, king of Babylon, king of lands', in the traditional titulature
(Kuhr t and Sher win-White 1991; Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993). A cuneiform
Akkadian document, the `Borsippa cylinder' (a building inscription, deposed in the
foundations of a temple), gives the Babylonian voice of Antiochos I (268 B C ).
Speaking as the legitimate king, in the local idiom, he issued a kingly narrative of
temple-building (complete with the kneading of mud-brick by the ritually pure royal
hands), and prayed to Nabu for protection over the dynasty. Another example comes
from the reign of Antiochos III, and has already been mentioned: the king accom
plished ritual gestures (prayer, sacrifice) in the Esagil, and in turn was greeted by the
local population and priests. The robe of Nebuchadnezzar, given or shown to Anti
ochos III, might stand as a symbol of the roles which Hellenistic kings had to perform
within local traditions.
In this respect, it might be fruitful to consider again the Hellenistic kings' inter
action with the Greek cities. The whole issue of autonomy and city liber ty, the `Stadt
und Herrscher' debate that has obsessed scholars of the Hellenistic period (as indeed
it did the Greek sources; e.g. Ma 1999), might be another local tradition, which the
kings had to accommodate by playing a specific role to be found within modes of
interaction. An obvious qualification might be that kings were not par t of the political
landscape in the Greek world, whereas kingship had been an integral par t of Egyptian
and Babylonian social and political organization. But such a statement would be too
sweeping. In addition to bearing in mind the diversity of Greek political organization,
it is impor tant to point out that many Greek cities had experienced centuries of
Achaimenid rule, more or less direct, with strategies of control and interaction that
180 John Ma



directly inspired those of the Hellenistic kings. Fur thermore, the classical age had
seen a variety of experiments in integrating the polis within massive, hegemonic
formations: the Athenian empire (in both its fifth- and fourth-centur y incarnations)
invented forms of autonomy and liber ty compatible (more or less by fiat or legal
fiction) with tribute paying, and found ways to make the local communities accept
external sources of legal authority ± the decrees of the Athenian demos (e.g.ATL II
T78d; SV II.320). The long, detailed, and rather unlikely provisions in the char ter of
the confederation of Greek states, as conceived by Antigonos Monophthalmos and
Demetrios Poliorketes in 302 (SV III.446), might be interpreted as an early example
of kingship accommodating a local discourse and local tradition (freedom, panhellen
ism, the `Common Peaces' of the four th centur y culminating with the League of
Corinth founded by Philip II in 338; federal institutions to mediate betweenpolis and
bigger state formation). Finally, the culture of the late classical age had seen a number
of shifts and developments towards `big-manism': individualistic militar y leadership
and monarchical-leaning theoretical thinking, which can be seen in Xenophon,
Isokrates or even Aristotle (on the shifts, see notably Aymard 1967). The idioms of
kingship adopted before Greek audiences were not exclusively about the local trad
itions of civic freedom, but drawn from a much broader set of concerns and images.
Hellenistic kings accommodated local autonomy in various forms of interaction to
achieve legitimacy: legal forms (grants of privileges, the negotiation of statuses), but
also the symbolical game of reciprocity (eunoia, charis), played out through a shared,
ritualized language of euergetism and honours (Bringmann 1993; Bringmann et al.
1995; Gauthier 1985; see the case of Teos, section 1 above: SEG 41.1003). But
the kings also chose from many other elements of Greek culture: the militar y
charismatic style of the four th centur y; aristocratic display (luxur y, gift-giving,
horse-racing, dedications in panhellenic shrines); ethical and philosophical justifica
tions; a Macedonian tradition of aristocratic culture shared by peers, solidified into a
cour t system, which itself played an impor tant role in a state formation; finally, god
like greatness, as made clear in the sur viving por traits of the kings (Smith 1988;
Stewar t 1993a) and in cour t poetr y (Hunter 2003, on Theocritus 17 and its con
struction of royal identity along the lines of Zeus' greatness). On the practical level,
there arose a type of citizen-interceder, who mediated between the king and his
potential for benefaction, and his fatherland: Kallias of Sphettos, an Athenian notable,
ser ved as a Ptolemaic of ficer, and helped his city on many occasions (Shear 1978, see
also Iscr.Cos. ED 229, for a whole dynasty of such citizen intermediaries between Kos
and the Ptolemies, then Rome). All these elements form the hodge-podge sometimes
termed `Hellenistic kingship: theor y and practice' in the Greek world.
The Greek material, detailed and familiar, makes two points clear: firstly, the
impact of the interaction between local community and king; secondly, and most
impor tantly for the present essay, the impor tant role of interaction in shaping royal
behaviour and the kingdoms themselves. These points can be seen in the Babylonian
or Egyptian contexts as well as in the Greek poleis. In the latter, interaction with the
kings had a considerable impact: institutional and ideological aspects of civic life,
actual and abstract, were concerned. In subordinate cities, royal pronouncements
had legal force, and had to be accommodated within local law (Gauthier 1993).
Dynastic loyalty reshaped civic discourse: that cardinal form of polis self-expression,
the decree, could be made to mention the king's interests among the various reasons
Kings 181



for collective action (Ma 1999: 228±35). Royal statues, honorific or cultural, erected
in conspicuous spots, redrew civic space. Ruler cult reshaped civic ritual, at impor tant
moments of political and social life. At Teos and Iasos, under Antiochos III, ruler cult
was deliberately woven into the fabric of the polis (Herrmann 1965a, with SEG
41.1003; Nafissi 2001; Chaniotis, this volume). A statue of the king in the council
house of the Teians became the centre for a whole nexus of gestures, shifted to this
new venue (sacrifices by entering magistrates, graduating ephebes, victorious ath
letes); a fountain named after the Seleukid queen, Laodike III, was to be used for
sacred purposes (sacrifices, nuptial baths). At Iasos, a cult of Laodike as Aphrodite was
overlaid on the rites de passage of citizen marriage. The latter cult was inaugurated in
response to a benefaction by Laodike, to provide dowries for poor citizen women: a
gesture which carried royal inter vention, however welcome, deep into the social
structures of a polis. Interaction with the king inevitably amounted to interference
with local discourses, even as the royal interlocutor found ways to engage with the
local communities within their idioms. This is strikingly illustrated by the Egyptian
material: ruler cult in the Egyptian shrines was an innovation, an invented tradition
assembled in response to the Ptolemies' demands and needs (D. J. Thompson 1990).
The decrees of the priestly synods, which seem so foreign to the Classicist and hence
clear evidence for the Ptolemies adopting non-Greek roles, in fact show clear influ
ence of Greek documents, especially the honorific decree which the poleis produced
for the kings: the Egyptian documents were probably produced along Greek models,
perhaps even phrased or thought in Greek before being rephrased into Egyptian
forms, in response to expectations and norms expressed by the Ptolemies (Clar ysse
2000c).
The process of interaction, where kings spoke local idioms to the various commu
nities, was dynamic. Local communities changed because of dialogue with the kings;
conversely, the kings accepted locally assigned and locally meaningful roles, as illus
trated above, which inevitably shaped their behaviour on the ground. Whether the
defender of a polis' liber ty and privileges before a panhellenic audience, or a pious,
tradition-minded royal worshipper in a Babylonian king, a Hellenistic ruler accepted
commitments before the local communities. Such commitments were taken seriously
by both par ties, the result of bargaining and negotiation, where the local actors often
achieved considerable success, as pointed out for Egypt and Babylonia (D. J. Thomp
son 1988; Gruen 1996). The collaborative process reflects the kings' need for
legitimacy, and for acceptance by the local communities: consent was granted on
local terms. The small city of Herakleia under Latmos, in Karia, illustrates this point.
When taken over by Antiochos III, it presented a long list of desiderata (a team of
twenty-two men went to see the Seleukid high of ficer, Zeuxis) ± exemption from
billeting and various taxes (notably on cattle and beehives, local resources of this city
between lake and mountain), grants of money and grain ± all of which Antiochos
agreed to (SEG 37.859). Most striking is the case of the harbour tax. The Herakleians
had earlier farmed this tax out, presumably among the citizens, the sum from the
highest bid being assigned in the civic budget for the oil-anointment of the young
men in the gymnasion: the harbour tax was burdened with civic obligation, or at least
civic purpose (the arrangement itself perhaps reflects a histor y of specific resources,
local needs and financial fine-tuning). When Antiochos took the city, the local
harbour tax became an imperial tax, levied to the profit of an outside power;
182 John Ma



nonetheless, the Herakleians obtained that Antiochos continue to pay the grant to
the gymnasium. The king financed a civic institution, recognizing the need and the
obligation that went along with taking over local revenue. Antiochos III could have
refused to do so, lived with Herakleian discontent and repressed eventual dissent by
force; what matters is precisely that he did not do so.
Royal power as a field of negotiation: the archetype, Alexander himself, needed to
engage in this activity; his militar y victories were followed by constant negotiation,
bargaining and accommodation of the local traditions of cities, elites, ethnic groups.
The `Orientalization' of Alexander is merely a reflection of this necessar y process
(Briant 1996: 862±84). Seen at this level, the Hellenistic kings exist merely as a
bundle of local commitments, a series of roles assigned by the subjects, an endless and
ubiquitous process of exchange and negotiation to achieve acceptance by dif ferent
constituencies. The various spheres were not completely segregated (as has been said,
too often). Borrowings occurred, between non-Greek and Greek images of kingship,
notably in Egypt (Koenen 1993): for instance, the old image of Persians or Asiatics as
enemies of Egypt and its king was expressed in Greek. Such permeability needs to be
analysed in the context of the wider phenomenon it hints at ± the factors for unity in
Hellenistic kingship.
3 Unity: Practices and Ideology
The Hellenistic kingdom was a state, a set of centralized and autonomous insti
tutions, exercising control and coercion over a territor y. Kingship as roads, garrisons,
governors and of ficials ± the phenomenon has been much studied, notably in classic
works by E. Bikerman and M. Rostovtzef f (Bikerman 1938; Rostovtzef f 1941).
Recently discovered evidence has confirmed the existence of royal roads, measured
by milestones (Callieri 1995), and also the generalized practice of control and
administration: the Seleukid, but also the Antigonid and the Attalid kingdom were
administered through complex state apparatuses similar to the long-known bureau
cracy of Ptolemaic Egypt (Musti 1966; Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 40±71;
Hatzopoulos 1996; Malay 1996, 1999: nos. 2, 179, 182; on Egypt, Orrieux 1983.)
The purpose of the structures of control was to carr y out the extraction of surplus
from the local communities. The kings and their men levied tribute, the emblematic
form of imperial taxation, but they also took their cut of local produce: for instance a
leg of f ever y boar and deer in the mountain city of Aigai, fees for pasture rights, dues
on beehives (SEG 33.1034; 37.859); movement of goods was taxed in harbours. In
some cases, resources were exploited directly by the king, to be resold by his adminis
trators, notably in the case of timber and grain (Gauthier 1989: 22±33; Briant 1994b,
on RC 3±4). A remarkable case is the tar of the Nabataean Dead Sea, which Anti
gonos Monophthalmos was looking for ward to collecting and reselling (his Friend,
none other than the historian Hieronymos of Karia, was defeated in his attempt to
realize his master's vision of imperial extraction and profit: Diod. 19.100.1±3).
Finally, the royal state could consume local surplus directly, when the kings and
their armies were billeted on local communities, which had to provide for the troops.
The forms of exploitation were varied, according to local resources and negotiation
with the communities concerned; however, the general principle of a state apparatus
whose main function was to control and to take was not negotiable. Apar t from the
Kings 183



great kingdoms (Ptolemaic, Seleukid, Antigonid, Attalid), a system of royal of ficials
and administrations appears in smaller realms, such as the kingdom of Cappadocia,
where the city of Hanisa had to send ambassadors to keep the royal treasur y from
taking over some intestate proper ty, or the Baktrian kingdom, where the treasur y at
Ai Khanoum attests a royal bureaucracy of extraction and palatial accumulation
(Rober t 1963: 457±523; Rapin 1992). Extraction was an essential par t of the royal
state's operations, and the fiscal nature of a Hellenistic kingdom could be expressed
quite cr udely, even in the interaction with local communities: a Ptolemaic of ficer
baldly wrote to the citizens of Arsinoe in Cilicia that they should prosper well in order
to pay more taxes (SEG 39.1426).
It is tempting to focus on the bureaucratic aspects of the royal state: autonomous in
function, organized according to r ules, rationale and administrative knowledge.
Continuity in administrative practice per tained even as individual kingdoms disap
peared. Achaimenid administration was followed by Alexander's, then by Ptolemaic
or Seleukid government. The Achaimenid colonization in the L ydian plain was
followed by Macedonian colonists, and Macedonian colonists replaced, or lived side
by side with Achaimenid barons: the name of a L ydian community, `Hyrkanioi
Makedones', was a palimpsestic reflection of the historical change of the late four th
centur y, but also of continuities. (This community, the descendants of landed soldiers
from two successive waves of imperial colonists, drawn from their respective imperial
diasporas, turned itself into a Greek polis; but that is another stor y). The satrapal
centre of Sardis and the Persian-occupied settlement of Kelainai remained impor tant
under the Seleukids; the Achaimenid seat at Meydanc
i
k Kale, in Cilicia, became a
Ptolemaic for t, complete with garrison, gymnasion and dedications for the king (SEG
31.1321). A governor, Olympichos, stayed in of fice in Karia, while control of the area
passed from Seleukids to Antigonids, in the second half of the third centur y (Crampa
1969). Recent documents have shown that when the Attalids definitely took over
Asia Minor from the Seleukids, they retained the Seleukid institutions of `high-priest'
and `of ficial in charge of sacred incomes', for control of the local shrines (H. Mu È ller
2000). A par ticularly instr uctive example of the autonomy of the royal state can be
found in an honorific decree from Apollonia under Salbake, a Seleukid foundation in
Eastern Karia. The document is wor th quoting:
( . . . it seemed good to the council and the people of the Apollonians: ± since Philo . . .
son of . . . ) earlier was continuously well [inclined in general towards the] people and in
par ticular towards each [one of the citizens]; [having been named hip]parch over the
[troops which stay with us], he ensures a complete state of discipline; ambassadors having
been sent to Ktesikles the . . . and to Menandros the manager of finances ( dioiketes),
concerning the interests of the people, he put himself for ward with great [zeal] when
the ambassadors left, and travelling with them he made ef for ts so that all the things
which we were asking for should be procured; moreover, when Demetrios the controller
of finances (eklogistes) summoned the ambassadors concerning the matters which Deme
trios the of ficial in charge of the sanctuaries had brought to his attention, and laid claims
against the ambassadors concerning the sacred villages of Saleioi in the mountains and
Saleioi in the plain, . . . he invited Demetrios to change none of the privileges which the
people enjoyed under his . . . , but to let them be as they had been until the present time,
and he not only delivered to the ambassadors, who were sent at a later time about the
matter of the villages mentioned above, a letter addressed to Demetrios and which
184 John Ma



agreed with the (people's) decree, but he also went to meet him and spoke to him with
great zeal, as the ambassadors bore witness, since they had heard him; in general, he does
not cease to be always responsible for some good towards the citizens; ± let it seem good
to the council and the people of the Apollonians: ± to praise Philo. . . on account of his
quality and his goodwill towards the people; to give him and to his descendants citizen
ship and exemption from all the taxes which the city has control of; to invite him to front
seating ever y year, and to crown him with a gold crown in the gymnic contest which is
celebrated in honour of king S[eleukos]. (J. and L. Rober t 1954: no. 166)
The city praised a garrison commander for helping it in its dealings with various
of ficials, based in Sardis, who seem to have had a good idea of the area and the share
of its resources which the royal administration was entitled. The financial of ficials
tried to claim the `sacred villages' as par t of the royal tax base (rather than subordinate
communities in the territor y of Apollonia under Salbake): in so doing, they pursued
their own autonomous goals of revenue raising, even at the detriment of a royal
foundation and, in all probability, earlier royal arrangements to sustain this colony.
However, it is just as impor tant to realize that the various operations carried out by
the kings and their men were also ideological. Administrative geography was never
merely practical, but also expressed power and extension; institutions and logistics
made empire visible. A royal order, given by Antiochos III in Iran, was passed on from
of ficial to of ficial, until finally displayed in a multitude of local shrines (one example
was found, at modern Pamukc Ë u in Mysia,
SEG
37.1010). This was the world of the
verb
suntasso
, to order someone to order; the Pamukc Ë u stele displayed the generative
power of the language of empire. The ef fect of language and of concrete processes of
administration was to create `imagined empire', a space of unity and ef ficacy filled
with the royal presence (whereas the kingdoms could be quite ragged on the ground,
with enclaves, dif ficult lines of communication and the constant proximity of rival
kingdoms).
Generally, royal state ideology subsumed the local into the unitar y, by assuming the
existence of a stable interlocutor who could deal with the local communities on their
own terms, without surrendering unity of purpose and operation. This function is
what the French describe with the adjective `fÂ ede Â rateur' (which does not mean
`federal'). One of the central gestures of kingship is giving or granting; it formed
the core of many local roles, examined above. Its impor tance extends beyond its
per vasiveness in all contexts, Greek and non-Greek (giving is the corollar y of taking,
and one of the factors for legitimacy in an `early state' such as the Hellenistic kingdom;
royal gifts also express power precisely by avoiding talking about power, in a collab
orative conversation between all par ties involved). To this trope, the kings assimilated
the act of granting privileges or statuses: the par ticular shapes of local existence in
communities, whatever their dif ferences, admitted the existence of a ruling power
who could make such grants; diversity itself amounted to a paradoxical af firmation of
the existence of a larger, stable authority which posited itself as the ultimate horizon
of the local communities. Alexander made grants of local rights to L ydians and Greek
cities alike. Antiochos III dealt with Greek
poleis
such as Teos, non-Greek commu
nities such as Iranian peasants and the spice city of Gerrha, eastern kings such as
Xer xes of Armenia or Euthydemos of Baktria; to all, his interaction took the form of
negotiation (against the background of violence, actual or potential), culminating in a
Kings

royal grant. Other phenom ena played a similar fun ction of subsum ing the local. Rule r
cult in the Ptole maic realm took on a variety of for ms, but centred on the same few
persons; the cult of A rsinoe II, foste red by Ptole my II, was celebrat ed by Greek
househo lds in Egypt, Egyptians, househo lds in cities of the Ptole maic overseas
empire a nd cities named Arsi noe founded acr oss the Easter n Mediter ranean, from
Asia Mino r to Keos (Robe r t 1968b: 192±210 ; Jone s and Habich t 1 989): acros s
cultural borders and a vast geograp hical space , this cult creat ed a concer t of cele bra
tion centr ing on the same figure, a nd manifest ing unity of purpose and auth ority ,
even in diversity . A simi lar analys is might be gi ven for the varieg ated ar mies fielded by
the Seleuki ds, and which wer e mani festation s of `imagi ned empire' (She r win -White
and Kuhr t 19 93: 53±6, 212±14) .
Earlier, I present ed the Helleni stic kings as deeply involve d in local role-play ing
before dif ferent constitue ncies with power fully ent renched and self-confi dent trad
itions. But in this sect ion, I have insist ed on the kings as the cent re o f a state, with
concrete oper ations o f adminis tration and a strong ideol ogy . What is the relation
between the se two analyses? One answer woul d be to vie w the relation as one of
equilibrium . The kings must obtain local consent to their powe r before they can
proceed to the vital opera tions of extrac tion; the roles they pl ay represen t a cover for
their powe r, but, conver sely , they are also the imposi tion of ter ms and conditions by
the local comm unities. T he end result is nonethe less to establish the exist ence o f a
unitar y royal state, underl ying the plethor a of local commitm ents and made accept
able by these commit ments, the pric e to pay for local accom moda tion. T his leads to
the second possi ble interpret ation, centred on the ideol ogical ang le dev eloped in this
section. The diver sity of roles playe d by the king s only reinforce s the unitar y ideolog y:
it shows the existence o f the bo undar y-cros sing kings, whose multipli city in inter
action exp resses identit y of purpose and author ity . Conver sely , the exist ence of a
central au thority creates the value of local priv ilege, grante d by the r uling powe r,
and in contra st with an unprivileg ed and d irectly r uled elsewhe re: the taci t co ntrast
with the latter stat e is consta ntly assume d in the negotiat ion of privile ge. H ere also,
the final ef fect is to assume the king's single author ity . Antio chos III ended up paying
the tradi tional o il-grant to Herakleia under Latmos; but the Herakl eians ended up
paying taxes, direct and indire ct, to the Sel eukid state; more impor tantly , they
accepted the integ ration within a supra-l ocal em pire, whose legit imacy they accepted
and whose vast ness they bore in min d as they grateful ly enjoyed local privileg es.
Resistance is possi ble, and the whole thing can be reje cted a s a self-fulfil ling con
game, if the local commun ities have the material stren gth to do so. Smyr na and
Lampsa kos refused an of fer from Antiochos III to `grant their liber ty', an d thus
conver t the ir political exist ence into stat uses created by ro yal speech-ac t (Livy 33.38);
Ptolema ic Egypt saw serious revol t, in the second cent ur y , and the priestl y elites may
have been far less co-op erative than the synod decre es wish us to believe (Huss 1994;
McGing 1997). Even so, the ideolog ical cohere nce and totalizin g powe r of royal
ideolog y rema in striki ng.

lar meanings within a system of power. A par ticular case is the ethnicity of the
Hellenistic king, since many of the examples of local traditions are non-Greek
(Babylonian, Egyptian): how did the Greco-Macedonian king fit? How did the
local role playing af fect his ethnic identity? This case should be examined separately,
because it concerns the Greekness of the Hellenistic king, in view of the recent
insistence on the adoption of pharaonic behaviour by the Ptolemies, and on the
Seleukids' conduct as Babylonian `king of lands'.
Just as there existed a unitar y royal state, aiming at control and extraction, the
various Hellenistic kingdoms were characterized by a single dominant ethnic group,
the Macedonians and Greeks who monopolized the ruling positions, star ting with that
of the kings and ending with the landlord colonists installed in foundations on royal
land, often living of f the labour of native peasants (Briant 1982). The Macedonians
were mostly the descendants of the conquest group which, under Alexander, had taken
over the Achaimenid dominion; identity was defined by a Macedonian father, and
hence could sur vive marriage with non-Macedonian women (Antiochos I, the son of
Seleukos I and the Iranian Apame, was nonetheless a Macedonian). The king was
Macedonian, identified as such in public documents both Greek and non-Greek (e.g.
Paus. 6.3.1, 10.7.8; OGIS 239; Briant 1994a; 1999). Admission to the group was
possible, by various channels (royal grant, habit, belonging to cer tain militar y units);
but generally, the Macedonians constituted a self-conscious colonial elite. As Macedo
nians, the kings and their states showed continuities with institutions developed in the
Argead kingdom, mostly by Philip II (Hatzopoulos 1996): cour t, Friends, royal pages,
land grants, militar y recruitment and institutions to interact and integrate Macedonian
cities within the royal state. As for the other element of the dominant group, the Greeks
were the citizens of the communities in the Greek world, mostly Old Greece and Asia
Minor; they ser ved the kings as mercenaries, of ficers, administrators and Friends in the
cour t system (Savalli-Lestrade 1998). Macedonians and Greeks seem to have consti
tuted politically dominant groups, defined by ethnic identity, perceived and pro
claimed. They can usefully be described with a concept developed by P. Briant, the
`dominant ethno-class' (Briant 1988; 1996). The concept was developed to study the
Iranian elites of the Achaimenid empire; in the Hellenistic period, this group lost its
dominant position, after Alexander's attempt at integrating them into the various
spheres of Macedonian dominance (army, cour t, elite families). The Iranian diaspora
left strong traces of its implantation (notably in Asia Minor), and individual members
found local niches for themselves, but the Iranians' position, as responsible members of
an imperial system, from which they profited, was taken by the Macedonian colonists
scattered in their own diaspora across the Hellenistic world.
Concretely, Macedonians and Greeks occupy the high positions of authority within
the royal states: the King, his cour t of Friends, his administrators and militar y of ficers,
even to a large extent the striking forces in his army, were drawn from the dominant
ethno-class (just as the Achaimenid ruling and fighting group was almost entirely
Persian). This conclusion, notably argued by Chr. Habicht, seems confirmed by
recent research (Habicht 1958; contra Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993; but see
now Savalli-Lestrade 1998). The cultural manifestations of kingship, produced by
the central institutions, were expressed in Greek. Militar y power and legitimacy was
expressed by the concept of spear-won land and the emblem of the small, round,
bronze-covered shield embossed with central sunburst and concentric crescents and
Kings 187



stars, the Macedonian phalangite's shield. These cultural phenomena represented
Greek militar y superiority and right to rule (Billows 1995: chapter 2). Major features
of kingly practice, from the centre of power, were Greek: the Hippodamian plan,
Greek population and Greek-style festivals of the royal foundations (Sher win-White
and Kuhr t 1993: 141±87); the coinage, with its naturalistic por traits, its visual
vocabular y and the language of its inscriptions; the paraphernalia of kingship, the
diadem, sceptre and purple chlamys (Smith 1988: chapter 4; OGIS 248 with Rober t
OMS 4.251). Peer interaction between Hellenistic kings took place largely in the
Aegean, in the form of strategic competition, or simply war. This peer interaction was
a collaborative venture to define the exercise of kingship (explicitly stated at Diod.
20.53): the language was Greek, and the space the ancient Greek lands, in spite of the
diversity of the individual kingdoms.
A clear sign of the perceived centrality of Greekness in Hellenistic kingship can be
seen in their imitation by smaller kingdoms ruled by non-Greeks, for instance
Bithynia, Cappadocia, Pontos and the Hasmonaean state. Correspondence occurred
in Greek even between kings further East, as shown by a royal letter found car ved on
a clif f in Armenia (Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 194±7; the site is Armavir, the
writer and recipient are local dynasts). Closer to the Aegean, the arena for interaction
between the major kingdoms, the Bithynian king Prusias I offered benefactions to
Byzantion, and was offended when the Byzantines were slow to acknowledge a
festival he had created, and to erect statues they had decreed for him (Polyb.
4.49.3; generally Hannestad 1996). Cappadocia is another example of a kingdom
which adopted Greek as the language of administration, and whose kings energetic
ally sponsored cultural Hellenism (high literar y culture, gymnasion culture; euerget
ism abroad), to gain acceptance in the international scene (Rober t 1963: 490±7). The
non-Greek kings imitated the cultural traits of the dominant group in the great
Hellenistic kingdoms: Hellenization of dynasts took over from the earlier phenom
enon of Iranization of elites under the Achaimenids (names, visual style, use of
Aramaic for public and private inscription, culture). The shift corresponded exactly
to the emergence of the Greco-Macedonian `dominant ethno-class' to replace the
earlier Achaimenid imperial groups.
But how does Greco-Macedonian kingship interact with the diversity of local roles,
in non-Greek idioms? The variety of forms taken by Hellenistic kings corresponded to
the need for communication with dif ferent constituencies, to each in its own lan
guage; a crucial aim was to locate power within traditions of legitimacy, and hence
obtain the agreement of the ruled, and their willingness to rationalize the king's
presence. But P. Briant has made clear that ethnic diversity reinforced the message of
dominance by a specific ethnic group, in Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleukid empire.
Ethnic diversity enabled the kings to play what we might call `ethno-power games',
by manipulating the economy of ethnic relations: continuities co-existed with rup
ture. The background to interaction remained the awareness of the king's foreign
ness, and Greekness, shared by ruler and ruled and sometimes explicitly stated. The
phenomenon is wor th illustrating, since the details show the deftness, and the
symbolical violence, which the kings could deploy to make domination visible. The
process star ts with Alexander. At Sardis, the first Achaimenid centre he took over, and
an impor tant settlement in its own right, he maintained continuity both as concerns
administrative structures (tribute, officers), and local privileges (the `ancestral laws' of
188 John Ma



the L ydians, the asylia of a major sanctuar y). But he also took the step of building a
shrine to Zeus Olympios, the Macedonian god, in the L ydian palace on the acropolis:
a symbolical manifestation of rule, but also the visible proclamation of his ethnic
identity as Macedonian king come to this par ticular place, characterized by its
traditions and histor y, associated with L ydian and Persian rule over Asia. Arrian's
account locates the initiative for the gesture in a storm sent by Zeus. This is perhaps
an echo of contemporar y explanations for the rupture represented by Alexander's
decision, or an indication of how this gesture could be read: conspicuous because of
its ethnic content, and expressing divinely sanctioned power (Arr. Anab. 1.17.3±8,
with Briant 1993).
Another case is that of Seleukid Babylonia. A Babylonian chronicle describes
Seleukos I marching to Macedonia, `his land'; the Borsippa cylinder, even as it
purpor ts to show Antiochos I per forming temple-building rites in the role of Baby
lonian `king of lands', breaks the sur face by introducing a new, ver y un-traditional
title: `the Macedonian'. Even as they interacted in locally defined spaces and gestures,
both foreign king and local priest knew that the former belonged to a Herrenvolk of
external conquerors (Briant 1994a). I would interpret in similar fashion the naked
`royal hero' on Seleukid official sealings found in Uruk. The image associated official
authority with images which were highly Greek (muscular, divine nudity) in a com
munity whose culture remained Babylonian; the foreign nature of the rulers was made
clear in practical transactions, since the sealings represented state validation of busi
ness contracts or tax payments (Smith 1988: 14; Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993:
149±50).
In Ptolemaic Egypt, images can be seen per forming similar functions. The priestly
decree passed for Ptolemy IV after his victor y at Raphia orders the production both of
Egyptian style images (as `Horus who has vindicated his Father', etc.) and of a hybrid
image, as seen on the best preser ved stele: surrounded by the hieroglyphic inscrip
tion, framed by Egyptian gods, smiting a kneeling Asiatic king, wearing the pharaonic
crown (pschent), Ptolemy IV nonetheless is shown as a dashing horseman, complete
with prancing horse, Greek breastplate, and long lance ± a Macedonian image of
prowess, seen for instance in the `Alexander Mosaic' (figure 11.2; Gauthier and Sottas
1925; Stewart 1993a: chapter 5; Briant 1999: 114±15. Admittedly, the lance is held
overarm rather than in the Macedonian underarm style, but I don't think this detail is
ver y significant). Here, as in the Borsippa cylinder, continuity is deliberately broken,
by inser ting an alien representation of kingly identity within traditional discourses:
Egyptian viewers saw the foreign origin and ways of the king; Greek viewers, if any
bothered to look at this Egyptian document, might have recognized the familiar
representation of the charging king on horseback, and seen a reminder, transpiring
even in an Egyptian representation, of the dominance of a Greek king over an ancient,
non-Greek land. Some `hybrid' Ptolemaic por traits, play similar games (Smith 1988:
92±3; 1996; S. Ashton 2001). They mingle traditional pharaonic representations and
Greek features (the carefully disarrayed locks ± a distant allusion to Alexander's
hairstyle ± poking out, as from a diadem, under the Egyptian headgear: nemes and
uraeus; the cornucopia so noticeably, perhaps even incongruously, carried by Egyp
tian-style representations, in traditional basalt or granite, of Ptolemaic queens). To
Egyptian viewers, such images might have acted as a reminder of the foreign origins
and traditions of the king. Simultaneously, they present a message to Greek audiences
Kings 189



Figure 11.2 Spot the Macedonian king. The Raphia stele (the best sur viving example of a
particular trilingual document commemorating the victor y of Ptolemy IV over Antiochos III at
Raphia in 217) shows, amidst an Egyptian scene, the king as `Macedonian cavalr yman': riding a
prancing warhorse, wearing a Greek-style corslet with pteruges as well as an Egyptian crown,
and wielding, one-handed, the long cavalr y lance. To what ef fect this rupture of ethnically
determined visual discourse? (From Gauthier and Sottas 1925)
of the Greekness of the king ruling over Egypt; at least, these images tr y to make rule
over Egypt clear in Greek visual terms (see Dunand 1981 and Erskine 1995, for the
various audiences of the grand procession of Ptolemy II, held in Alexandria).
To grasp the exact patterns of intent, decision-making, unconscious gesture,
perception, communication, inter ference, would need close reading of documents
like the Raphia decree; even in the case of such detailed texts, the exact actors
involved in producing these overlapping discourses (king, local elites, local communi
cations exper ts, bilingual members of the system) largely escape our knowledge. But
the ethnic strategies, the fields of power created, their link with royal domination, are
clear enough. Both in Babylon and in Egypt, words and images reminded the non
Greeks of the domination by the Greco-Macedonian king, with his own traditions
and his own men. In itself, such manipulation of local discourse was a means of
domination and even violence upon the subject population: it expressed power, and
the ethnic origins of power. A fur ther function was to provide a context for those
cases of interaction where the kings did adopt the roles ascribed by local, non-Greek
tradition. The ruler escaped any claim by the local tradition to exclusive representa
tion of kingship: the Hellenistic king, in per forming local gestures of kingship,

5 Towards a (Cultural) History of Hellenistic Kingship
The analy ses of fered ab ove for the econo my of divers ity and unity in creat ing
ideolog ical forc e for the Hell enistic king dom, a nd the strateg ic coexist ence of expres
sion in local, et hnically diverse idioms and dominant ethnic group, were develope d b y
P . Briant, fo r the Helleni stic period, in the prolonga tion of his an alysis fo r the same
phenom ena under the Achaim enids (Bria nt 1988 ; 1996; 1 999). `To each in his own
languag e' is the exp ression used by the Book of Est her to describe the operat ion of
the extensiv e, mul ti-ethn ic empir e of A hasuer us /Ar taxer xes. One local tradi tion was
that of the Gre ek cities in Asia Minor. T hese had the ir local gods, to be interacted
with: Dar ius I protected a shrine of Apol lo near Magnesia on Maeander ( ML 12);
Xer xes sacr ificed a thou sand oxen to Athena Ilia s (Hdt. 7.43). But they also had their
local pol itical traditio ns to be acc ommoda ted: af ter the Ionia n revolt, the Achaim enid
state, which had earlier fostered local tyrants, suppor ted the local tradition of polis
democra cy , responding to developments in polis culture, from archaic aristocrats and
tyrants to mid dling citize n regim es (Hdt. 6.92 ). In Egypt, Darius could be repre
sented as pharaoh, but also in deli berately Persian style, as in a statue car ved by
Egyptian workm en: the king wears Per sian garb and paraphe r nalia (akinake s, lotus
flower), and while the hierogly phic inscr iptions on the base and the robe call Darius
`king of Upper and Lower Egypt' , the inscr iption in Old Pers ian proc laims the powe r
of the dom inant ethno- class: `A gre at god is A hura Mazda . . . who made Dar ius king .
This is the statue whi ch Darius the king has ordered be made in Egypt , so that the
viewer might know in future that the Pers ian man holds Egypt . . . ' (Briant 1999, esp .
105±9; the Old Persian text from the French translatio n by F. V allat). As Briant poin ts
out in his analy sis of the Raphia relief, the co ntinuities are direct (Alexand er took over
the Achaim enid stat e and its operat ions), but also str uctu ral: strat egies for subsum ing
local diver sity and co nver ting it to sign s of central powe r were the only way to
consti tute empi re.
The finding s of the `New A chaimeni d Histo r y' are indisp ensable to underst anding
Helleni stic kingship , its prob lems and its ideolog ical manoeuv res whe n faced with
local commun ities, Greek and non- Greek. T he A chaimeni d paradig m is a deter min
ant factor in the genealogy of Hellenistic kingship; mutatis mutandis, Achaimenid
solut ions becam e those of the Ptolemi es, Seleuki ds, Antigon ids and A ttalids,
extende d to the grea ter par t of the Greek world as well as the ancient near east . All
the same, this factor of orig ins and continuit y should n ot obscure the major dif fer
ence: the disapp earance of Ach aimenid stabi lity , in favour of compe ting super-pow ers.
Actual cont rol of any local comm unity could be sur prisingly pre carious, in the
absence of any `b alance of powe r' (Aus tin 1986). The citi es' margin of manoeuv re,
between c ompetin g king doms and their desire for freedo m, nev er quite disap peared,

and gave the transactions between rulers and ruled an underlying tension that
prevented the relation from being one of pure domination (Ma 1999). The analysis
offered above tried to show the ideal workings of royal ideology, as an Achaimenid
style manifestation of its own stability and dominance. It assumes an ideal type,
dominant in the Hellenistic world, as the outcome of the histor y of the Greek
world in the four th centur y. But this analysis is abstract, and, in assuming the
existence of a stable type, neglects the great diversity of situations the Hellenistic
kings confronted in the histor y of the period and the institution. Stability could be
wishful thinking, not always self-fulfilling. If the economy of concrete power relations
between subject and ruler changed, the ideological operations of subsuming diversity
could reveal their hollowness: they ended up covering the king's weakness rather than
expressing, more or less directly, the king's dominance. This is perhaps the case of the
later Ptolemies faced with native rebellion, or of the later Seleukids' relations with the
Jews: because of dynastic strife in the centre of power, the kingly gestures of granting
privileges within local traditions became a matter of pretending to of fer what the
kings could not refuse (Ma 2000c).
Generally, the histor y of Hellenistic kingship is much more diverse than the
ideological strategy studied in this essay. One aspect that will modify the standard
picture is the recent work on Macedonian kingship, the institutions of the Argead
kingdom, perpetuated by the Antigonids, but also, to some extent, by the other
dynasties (Hatzopoulos 1996, as mentioned briefly section 4 above). In the ethnically
diverse Seleukid empire, there existed a class of cities, all royal colonies, which kept
institutions which originated in the Macedonia of Philip II: a council bearing the
Macedonian name of peliganes; the single of ficial called epistates, chosen among the
civic elite, governing the city for the king but answerable to the civic community, in
conjunction with which he elaborated decrees (Hatzopoulos 1996; Hatzopoulos,BE
00, 453). Seleukeia on the Tigris in Babylonia, and Seleukeia in Pieria, in Nor thern
Syria, are the two known examples; I would also draw attention to the `Greek'
citizenr y of Seleukid Babylon, with their epistates (known in cuneiform texts, where
the word is transcribed): this might be another instance of a Seleukid foundation with
an ancestral Macedonian constitution (van der Spek 2001). But the existence of such
communities raises more questions than it answers. In Macedonia, the `federal' or
`national' institutions functioned to integrate the cities, as municipal units, within the
national kingdom which they provided with manpower and whose constituent par ts
they were. Hatzopoulos' picture is closer to that of an ancient `constitutional mon
archy' or e Âtat de droit than to the structures of domination which I have studied
above. The Macedonian ethno-elite in the time of the Successors to Alexander and in
the early Hellenistic period thus came from a vital political culture of their own, just as
the Iranian elite of the Achaimenid empire came from a specific culture with its
defining traits. The Antigonid realm ran itself along the traditional institutions until
its end, proving their suitability for the exceptionally large, rich and populous state
in nor thern Greece. But such institutions were not extended out of Macedonia,
for instance into southern Greece. To what extent did these Macedonian insti
tutions contribute to the central structures of kingship in the Hellenistic world?
The picture is still unclear. To star t with, we do not know whether Alexander's cities
were founded along the lines of `Macedonian' institutions: how would the latter have
suited the much vaster scale of his empire? It seems clear that neither Ptolemies
192 John Ma



nor Attalids founded cities of Macedonian settlers organized along the traditional
constitution. The Seleukids kept the system, at least in par t, to organize the Macedo
nian diaspora that formed the core of their army (but not for all of their foundations):
was this remnant of Macedonian organization a fossilized marker of ethnic dif ference
qua reminders of practice in a faraway land of origin? Why in the Seleukid empire
only?
Finally, a topic that cannot be approached in these pages is the Hellenistic king as
object for cultural histor y (mostly in the Greek material), rather than ideological
analysis: the impact of kingship on political culture and hopes ± why did the revolted
slave Eunous, in second-centur y Sicily, call himself King Antiochos (Rober t OMS
4.210±1)? Why did the Maccabees, creating their post-Seleukid state, turn into a
Hellenistic kingdom of their own? A cultural histor y would also have to take into
account many other features: the connection between kingship and the impor tant
phenomenon of Hellenistic `colonization'; the impact of royal lifestyle and morality
on conceptions of the self; the dynastic, familial and sexual life of the royal houses
(Ogden 1999); the cour t as place of artistic and philosophical patronage; the
imagined and emotional king of art, philosophical writing and literature (for instance
Plutarch's brilliant, moralizing, reworking of Demetrios Poliorketes along explicitly
theatrical models; or even the spot-on application of Cavafy's neo-Hellenistic sens
ibility to E. Bevan's histor y of the Hellenistic dynasties).
One such element that can be examined here is the creation of a royal timespace
(for the concept, I. Morris 2000), combining vivid involvement in the present and
the local with broader scales and perspectives. This combination was not simply an
ideology of domination (as argued in this chapter): it also was the ver y exercise of
kingship, and its deepest, most essential pleasure. It mobilized huge resources to
come into existence, richly rewarding those involved in the enterprise.
An obvious instance is the kings' practice of Big War: fought on a strategic scale
where the immediacy and danger of physical engagement alternated with a geography
of vast movements, royal war fare converted place into space. A patchily preser ved
poem, in elegiacs, shows a king's anger, upon receiving some piece of news (attack by
the Galatians?): `Those men of violence and foolishness (hubristai te kai aphro
nes) . . . the salar y of this piece of madness . . . they will know after learning their
lesson . . . strong enslavement . . . to the deep-wealthy Medes . . . the furious Galatian
man . . . not in purple clothes nor with per fumes . . . anointing his soft skin. . . but
sleeping on the ground and under the open sky . . . ' (Supp. Hell. no. 958). The latest
editors see this poem as a Ptolemaic document, but I consider it a piece of Seleukid
cour t poetr y (even though it was found in Egypt: perhaps a piece of booty?).
Sweeping movement across space, from the hereness of the scene to the thereness
of the next enemy, is driven by the king's temper and vision; geographical distance,
but also cultural boundaries (hard people/soft people), are transcended by royal
energy. Less bombastically but just as strikingly, a Babylonian astronomical diar y
records a strike force of twenty elephants, passing through on its way from Baktria
to fight in the First Syrian War: the local community watches on as the king's will
makes things happen, in this case to make war elephants walk from one end of the
empire to the other (Briant 1994a: 458±9, on Sachs and Hunger 1988, year 273; also
Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 46). A whole segment of historiography recognized
and perhaps helped constitute royal time space: Hieronymos' narrative of the contest
Kings 193



between Eumenes and Antigonos Monophthalmos focused on the leaders' master y of
geography, their strategic sense as well as their tactical skill (Syme 1995: chapter 18);
narratives of sieges showed the moments when the extension of a king's power came
to bear on a single point, but also when a local obstacle threatened to disrupt the
fluidity of strategic movement across the space of royal war.
Other features of Hellenistic life could be related to the royal timespace of local
involvement and boundar y crossing. Alexandrian poetr y collected elements from
local religion and culture (these, it is wor th insisting, enjoyed great vitality and
continued relevance), and conver ted them into avant-garde cour t poetr y: the oper
ation is related to games of identity and power within royal timespace. The regimen
of the king's body, alternating between the strenuous and the luxurious; the liking for
gigantic or exorbitantly expensive objects; the infliction of tor ture and violence, and
hence the breaking down of social boundaries concerning the body (van Proosdij
1934; Fontenrose 1960) ± these too belonged to the pleasures of kingship, to be
found in the managing of interaction, of boundaries and of scale. All these issues
appear clearly in the stor y of Antiochos III, who provided the opening vignettes of
this essay: the diversity of these images of fered a way into the central trope of
kingship, the subsuming of the local into the unitar y, by concrete and ideological
operations. Diversity and unity have proved as impor tant, to understand the Hellen
istic kings, as change and continuity: diversity determined the experiences, as well as
the ideologies, of kingship.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I would like to thank A. Erskine and A. Ber trand for their invitation to write this
chapter, and their patience on editorial matters. J.-M. Bertrand illuminated the issues
in conversation, indeed sketched the chapter out in a few sentences; P. Brown ver y
early on asked me questions which I could not answer; M. Hatzopoulos asked me the
questions to which I had hoped he had the answers. To all many thanks.
FURTHER READING
The collection of ar ticles edited by P. Bilde et al. (1996) gives a sense of recent
evolution in research on kingship, and especially the way in which the topic has grown
much more complex, in integrating smaller kingdoms and non-Greek evidence ( N B
Gruen, this volume).
Two conceptual advances really af fect the way we talk about Hellenistic kingship.
The first is J.-M. Ber trand's rethinking of royal power as discourse (1990): speech-act
theor y helps us understand how kingdom was created as royal pronouncement. The
second is the `new Achaimenid histor y', which has culminated in P. Briant's massive
Histoire de l'empire perse (1996); see also Briant 1990, 1994a, 1999, on imperial
strategies and continuities. Both Bertrand's and Briant's work inform the present
essay (as they did my book on Antiochos III: Ma 1999).

On ethnicity and kingship, D. J. Thompson's book on Ptolemaic Memphis (1988),
and L. Koenen's essay on the old theme of the Ptolemies' religious and ethnic identity
(1993) are illuminating; the Seleukid side is dominated by Sher win-White and Kuhr t
1993, arguing for the Near-Eastern nature and base of the Seleukid kingdom. Kuhr t
and Sher win-White 1991, on the Borsippa cylinder, is a tour de force and an eye
opener.
On the str ucture of the kingdoms, Austin's essay on war fare and Hellenistic
kingship (1986) is essential; Bikerman 1938 is impor tant on the legal concepts that
shaped Seleukid r ule. Billows 1995 is a recent sur vey of issues in administrative
histor y. M. Hatzopoulos (1996, 2001) has studied a par ticular case, the `national
kingship' of the Macedonians. On the impor tant institution of royal benefaction, and
civic honours, Gauthier 1985 is incontournable.
But more impor tant than the various currents of interpretation are the documents,
visual and textual. R. R. R. Smith's essay on Hellenistic royal por traits (1988) is also a
study on Hellenistic kingship, as well as a lesson in how to read sculpture as docu
ments; see also A. Stewar t's book on Alexander's `faces of power' (1993a). The
catalogue to the 1998 exhibition in Paris, La gloire d'Alexandrie, gives a lavish
image of the culture of one, ver y special, royal city. The other place to look is at the
epigraphical material, gripping in its directness and vividness: the inscriptions record,
but also embody, the transactions between king and local community. Louis Rober t
has treated documents in ways that illuminate aspects of Hellenistic kingship (e.g.
Rober t 1968b; Rober t and Rober t 1954; 1983). Among recent (or not so recent)
finds, I would single out the Teian decrees for Antiochos III (Herrmann 1965a,SEG
41.1003), the interaction between Sardis and Antiochos III (Gauthier 1989, SEG
39.1283±5), and the negotiations between Antiochos III and Herakleia under Lat
mos (WÈ orrle 1988, SEG 37.859); the latter case is fundamental to understanding the
creation of legitimacy between the r uled and the r uling par ties. Equally exciting is a
recently found set of royal letters (SEG 47.1745, from publication by L. Jonnes and
M. Ricl, 1997; BD 43): Eumenes II grants the status of polis to a community in
Phr ygia, Tyriaion, after receiving an embassy (which included one Brennos, probably
a Celtic mercenar y or militar y colonist, or the descendant of such a man). One can
read a letter by an Attalid king lecturing a community in Phr ygia, including the
bearers of Celtic names, on the impor tance of being a polis, just as one can read a
Babylonian account of a Seleukid king kneading mud-brick and boasting about it: the
Hellenistic period, and the study of Hellenistic kings, abound in such ef fects.

CHAPTER TWELVE
Cities
Richard Billows
Scholars who have written histories of the Greek city-states have most often tended to
draw their histories to a close with the advent of the Hellenistic Era, on the assump
tion that the creation of the Hellenistic empires brought the great age of the Greek
cities to an end. This is exactly the opposite of reality; for in reality, the Hellenistic era
was in many respects the most impor tant period in the histor y of the Greek cities, a
period of dramatic growth and development. Geographically, the reach of the Greek
city was enormously expanded by the foundation of several hundred new cities
throughout western Asia from the Mediterranean coast all the way to modern
Afghanistan and Pakistan. Not only was there a far greater number of Greek cities
in the Hellenistic era, covering a much greater geographical range, but the size of
Greek cities had increased. The largest Greek cities of Classical times, Athens and
Syracuse, had populations on the order of a hundred to a hundred and twenty five
thousand persons, or perhaps as much as a quar ter of a million if one includes their
surrounding territories. A number of Hellenistic cities were much larger than this ±
Antioch-on-the-Orontes and Seleukeia-on-the-Tigris may have reached half of a
million, Alexandria in Egypt may even have reached a million ± and there were
quite a few cities that were as large as classical Athens and Syracuse.
Besides sheer numbers and size, one must also consider the sophistication of urban
development, both physical and cultural, and the nature of inter-city contacts and
relations ± far more elaborate during the Hellenistic than during previous eras. In terms
of city-state culture, what is clearly obser vable is the extension of cer tain uniform
institutions and norms throughout the Hellenistic world. Most obvious is the triumph
of the Hellenistic koine dialect over local (Doric, Aeolic, Ionic, etc.) dialect forms in all
Greek cities. It is wor th emphasizing that thekoine (or `common') dialect was a slightly
modified form of the Attic dialect of classical Athens. For it is clear that, as in language,
so in vir tually all cultural matters, the Hellenistic Greek cities modelled themselves on
classical Athens. Attic drama was ever ywhere admired and watched; city after city
prided itself on being a democracy; Athenian higher education, in the form of Iso
kratean rhetoric, became the standard Greek higher education; and so on. This same
cultural uniformity, based in great par t on the Athenian model, is found in physical



infrastructure and accompanying administrative institutions. Several authors ± Dio
Chr ysostom (Or. 48.9) and Pausanias (10.4.1) most notably ± present what is vir tually
a checklist of the physical infrastructure a city must have to be considered wor thy of the
term polis: surrounding walls, a monumentally defined agora, a theatre, at least one
gymnasion, stoas, fountain houses, a council house and/orpr ytaneion (town hall). And
with this infrastructure went administrative of fices ± theagoranomos (market warden),
the gymnasiarchos (head of gymnasium), amphodarchai (street governors), astynomoi
(city wardens) ± each of which should be properly defined and regulated by adminis
trative laws.
In all of this one can see that in the Hellenistic period a broad consensus had
emerged on what it meant to be a Greek city, and on the basic cultural components of
Greek civic life. This consensus was created and fostered by a host of inter-city
contacts and relations of ever y sor t, both at the individual, private level and at the
of ficial, public level. It is, for instance, common to find in Greek cities decrees
honouring both individual citizens of other cities, and whole cities, for benefactions
conferred; these honorific decrees look remarkably similar throughout the Hellenistic
world; and a ver y common element found in the explanator y segment of such decrees
is a statement to the ef fect that the individual or city honoured has done his/its best
to be of ser vice both privately to individual citizens of the honouring city, and to the
city as a whole. The widespread proliferation of such decrees gives a clear impression
of a community of Greek cities in constant friendly contact with each other. Hellen
istic Greeks were aware of this, and spoke of the oikoumene ± the inhabited, civilized
world ± meaning the world of the Greek cities. Greek cities arbitrated disputes among
fellow Greek cities, asked for and sent panels of respected citizens to expeditiously
settle backlogs of cour t cases in each others' communities, made agreements to
respect each other's sanctuaries as `holy and inviolate', and in general interacted
and co-operated in a host of other ways besides. There were, of course, outbreaks
of war fare from time to time between neighbouring or rival cities, but even such
hostilities ± so common in the archaic and classical eras ± were mitigated in the
Hellenistic era by the quickness of other cities to inter vene with of fers of arbitration.
In general, one may say that the world of the Hellenistic Greek cities was one of
considerable, peaceful interconnectedness.
1 The Geographic Extension and Size of the Greek Cities
The idea of extending the reach of Greek urban civilization by founding new Greek
cities in new territories was hardly a new one at the beginning of the Hellenistic Era:
the Greeks had already gone through a great age of overseas colonization between
about 750 and 550 B C , during which the shores of the Mediterranean, nor th Aegean
and Black Seas were settled with perhaps as many as 150 or more new Greek cities.
Available sites for such colonization had, however, been largely used up by the middle
of the sixth centur y; yet the Greek population growth that had fuelled the coloniza
tion continued, as can be seen from the growth in size of Greek towns and cities
during the late sixth and fifth centuries. During the four th centur y there was in the
Greek world a substantial `surplus' population of political exiles, adventure seekers,
rootless and impoverished people, and the like, according to conser vative political
writers like the Athenian Isokrates (Seiber t 1979; McKechnie 1989). Isokrates
Cities 197



proposed in various speeches and pamphlets (most notably in thePanegyrikos and the
Philippos) a solution to this problem: a unified Greek attack on the Persian Empire
that would open up western Asia to a new wave of Greek settlement, and create a new
life for the rootless and disfranchised in new Greek cities to be founded in Asia.
This is precisely what happened during the half-centur y or so between Alexander
the Great's crossing to Asia in 334 and the settling down of the lands he conquered
into the three major Hellenistic Empires in the 270s: the second great age of Greek
colonization. This new phase of colonization had its beginning with Alexander's
orders to found Alexandria in Egypt in 333/2: Alexandria was the first of the new
cities in the lands of the former Persian Empire, and was destined to become the
largest and most famous. Alexander followed up on this by founding a dozen or more
colonies ± mostly likewise named Alexandria after himself ± in inner Asia to garrison
and hold down the eastern provinces of his empire. He achieved thereby a great,
indeed somewhat exaggerated, reputation as a city-founder, for in fact the chief credit
for founding new cities in the conquered lands of western Asia must go to Alexan
der's successors Antigonos the One-eyed and Seleukos Nikator (Billows 1990; G.
Cohen 1978; Grainger 1990b), and to a more limited degree to their rival L ysima
chos and to Seleukos' successor Antiochos I.
The end result of this colonizing work was the emergence of scores of new Greek
cities throughout Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia, and to a more
limited extent also further east in the trans-Tigris regions of Media, Baktria and the
other so-called `upper satrapies'. Many of these `new' cities were in fact continuations
of old native cities or settlements with the imposition of a Greek population element,
Greek civic institutions and a Greek (often dynastic) name: thus Susa became Seleu
keia-on-the-Eulaios, Sumerian Uruk became, it seems, Antioch-on-the-Ishtar-Canal,
Gaza became another Seleukeia, and even Jerusalem famously almost became an
Antioch, sparking the Maccabaean revolt (van der Spek 1987: 73; Sher win-White
and Kuhrt 1993: 161±87). It was certainly normal for new Greek cities to have a
substantial native population included in them, particularly the larger new cities
(Billows 1995: 154), and this inevitably led over the course of a generation or two
to the Hellenization of the natives thus included. Some ancient native cities were
permitted to remain as they were ± Babylon and Jerusalem for example ± but inevit
ably they tended to decline due to the rivalr y of new Greek cities, as Babylon did to
Seleukeia-on-the-Tigris, or succumb to the lure of Hellenization, as Jerusalem
threatened to do (van der Spek 1987). In the end, there were well over a hundred
new Greek cities by even the most conser vative computation (G. Cohen 1995;
Tscherikower 1926), and each of them had in its way received the extensive physical,
legal, social, cultural and religious elaboration that was required in order to be a
Greek city in a meaningful sense. That is to say that the structures and social, political,
religious and cultural norms and institutions of Greek urban civilization were now to
be found throughout western Asia as well as in Greece and the older colonial regions;
and in fact in some respects these older regions of Greek culture were outshone by the
`new Greece' of the Hellenistic colonial world. Many of the new cities, and by and
large the most important of them, bore dynastic names, that is names based on those
of the kings who founded them and of their relatives. Thus in addition to a number of
Alexandrias, cities named Seleukeia (after Seleukos Nikator) and Antioch (Antiocheia,
after Seleukos' father and son, both named Antiochos) abounded, and there were
198 Richard Billows



quite a few named after female members of the Seleukid dynasty: Laodikeia (Lao
dike), Apameia (Apame), Stratonikeia (Stratonike), etc. Usually the many homonym
ous cities that resulted from this practice are distinguished from each other by some
geographic designation: for example Antioch-on-the-Orontes, Antioch-in-Pisidia,
Antioch-in-Persis; or Seleukeia-in-Pieria (on the Syrian coast), Seleukeia-on-the
Tigris, Seleukeia-on-the-Kalykadnos (in Cilicia), etc. Other cities, usually smaller
and less important ones, were named after cities in Macedonia and the rest of Greece:
Europos (Dura), Pella, Larisa, and so on.
Although we have no reliable ancient population statistics, and although the
physical extent of Hellenistic cities is often hard to figure due to incomplete excav
ation, the existence of modern cities on the sites of ancient ones, and/or the presence
of a Roman overlay not always easy to distinguish from Hellenistic layers, it remains
clear nevertheless that many Hellenistic cities reached a substantial size in both
population and extent compared to classical Greek cities. The largest Hellenistic cities
were very much larger than the largest classical cities: not only the famous Alexandria
in Egypt, Antioch-on-the-Orontes, and Seleukeia-on-the-Tigris, but quite a few other
Hellenistic cities were of a very respectable size by any standards. This is hardly the
place to give a list, but one may mention such cities as Alexandria Troas, Nikaia,
Ephesos, Smyrna, Pergamon, Stratonikeia-in-Karia, Laodikeia-by-the-Sea, Apameia
on-the-Orontes, to name just a few. Population estimates for these cities are problem
atic and controversial, but few would doubt that cities such as the great Alexandria,
Antioch and Seleukeia counted many hundreds of thousands of inhabitants: PlinyHN
6.122 mentions 600,000 for Seleukeia; Diod. 17.52.6 claims, purportedly based on
Ptolemaic census records, that Alexandria had over 300,000 free inhabitantsc. 58 B C ,
and by this he presumably means the citizen community, excluding Egyptian and
servile inhabitants who will certainly have outnumbered the citizen class (and see
Downey 1963 on Antioch). That cities with a hundred thousand or more inhabitants
were no longer the great rarities they had been in the fifth and fourth centuries is also
not controversial: such cities of old Greece as Athens, Corinth, Argos and Syracuse
continued to be major metropolitan centres during the third and early second centur
ies at least, and newer cities like Pergamon, the refounded Ephesos and Smyrna,
Stratonikeia-in-Karia, Seleukeia-in-Pieria and Apameia-on-the-Orontes were certainly
of this order of size. Of course most cities were smaller, but it is clear that most Greeks
in western Asia at least did not live very far away from a substantial city, and that there
was a scattering of truly large cities; and in view of the greater ease and security of
travel, it was possible for quite a few Greeks to at least visit a large city, even if they did
not live in one, so that the experience of truly urban life, as opposed to small town life,
was much more widespread in Hellenistic than in earlier times.
2 Town Planning and Physical Infrastructure
During the classical period, the so-called Hippodamian town plan ± streets laid out on
a rectangular grid around central public spaces ± had become common, and during
the Hellenistic era it was essentially universal for all newly founded cities as well as for
re-founded or modernized older cities (Owens 1991: 74±93 for a good overview).
The basis for the success of this pattern of town planning lay, of course, in its
simplicity: it was easy to lay out a city on this pattern, and when built the city was
Cities 199



easy for its inhabitants and visitors to get around in. It is of course for these same
reasons that this grid pattern has been adopted in many modern cities, as ver y
famously in New York for example. There is no doubt that this generalized grid
plan created a cer tain sameness in Hellenistic cities: Wycherley (1962: 35) speaks
of `the mass-production of new Hellenistic cities in Asia which took place under
Alexander and his successors', and Green (1990: 160), quoting this, adds that `their
axial-grid plans [were] as monotonously repetitive as those of the American Midwest'.
One should not exaggerate this sameness: these cities were founded in widely dif fer
ent locales, and the Greeks were ver y alive to the need to adapt their town planning to
the specific geography of the site. As a result, there is in fact a great deal of variation in
shape and arrangement of Hellenistic cities within the basic axial-grid form. But
without doubt, the sameness of the axial plan was an attraction: settlers in the new
cities and visitors between cities could feel at once comfor table and at home in an
urban environment that was basically similar wherever they went.
How this axial-grid town planning was fitted to the topographical realities of actual
settlement sites to produce this basic sameness and familiarity, while at the same time
responding to the features of the landscape so as to make the best of each site and
introduce a suitable variety, can best be illustrated by looking in detail at some well
known examples. I will examine Priene, Ephesos and Pergamon: three well excavated
and studied sites that show the variety introduced by dif fering landscapes, and also
illustrate a dif ferent kind of variety ± Priene being a town of rather moderate size,
Ephesos a large and impor tant city and Pergamon a royal city, capital of the second
rank but still wealthy and impor tant Attalid kingdom.
Priene was an ancient Ionian city which was moved to a new site some time in, most
probably, the third quar ter of the four th centur y: the ver y end of what we call the
`Classical' era and beginning of the Hellenistic. It is therefore one of the ver y earliest
Hellenistic cities, and is also one of the best preser ved: since the city dwindled in
impor tance in the early Roman period, it has little Roman overlay on the Hellenistic
remains, and the site was abandoned at the end of antiquity and never resettled. We
have therefore an almost per fectly undisturbed Hellenistic city, thoroughly excavated
under the German archaeologists Humann and Wiegand in the late nineteenth
centur y (see e.g. Akurgal 1990: 185±206). The city was founded on the southern
slope of the Cape Mykale peninsula, overlooking the Gulf of Latmos to the south ±
though today, due to the continued silting action of the River Maeander, it overlooks
a wide flat agricultural plain. It represents an almost per fect example of the axial-grid
plan: it is basically circular in shape, though with irregularities to take advantage of the
terrain, with public spaces and buildings at the centre; its axial grid is formed of wide
(c. 14±15 ft.) avenues running east±west, and narrower (c. 8 ft.) cross streets running
nor th±south (figure 12.1). The defensive advantages of the site are obvious ± to its
immediate south lay the Gulf of Latmos, and to the nor th a steep clif f on the top of
which a for tified outpost formed a kind of acropolis ± and it was surrounded from the
star t by a strong city wall. The complex of public buildings at the centre of the city
comprised, north to south, a theatre, a gymnasium, a bouleuterion (council house)
and pr ytaneion (city hall) side by side, a grand stoa, and finally ± again side by side ± a
two par t agora and a temenos of Zeus Olympios. All basic civic requirements ±
political, social, commercial, religious and cultural ± were therefore met in this large
central agglomeration. The two par t agora is noteworthy: a large main agora covering
200 Richard Billows



two whole city blocks was flanked to the west by a smaller area ± roughly half a block ±
that seems to have been a commercial market place (Akurgal 1990: 193). This
separation of the political/social and commercial functions of the agora into two
distinct spaces was quite a normal feature of Hellenistic town planning, as we shall
see. A little to the west of the main group of public buildings/spaces lay a subsidiar y
group comprising the temple of Athena, patron goddess of the city, and a probably
commercial stoa to its immediate south. Another important temple, to the goddess
Demeter, lay in the north-west quadrant of the city; but the most important add
itional public space was at the southern edge of the town: a large second gymnasium
and a stadium, undoubtedly built there to take advantage of the flatter terrain in this
area.
In its basic orientation, the city is dominated by the north±south slope of the flank
of Mt. Mykale it sits upon. The main avenues run east±west because they thus are flat;
and it is the narrower north±south cross streets that negotiate the slope, which is in
places quite steep, reducing the streets to stairs. The city blocks in effect sit on a series
of terraces, and most buildings, public and private, face to the south to take advantage
of the open vista over the Gulf and the winter sunlight this terracing afforded. Many of
the housing blocks are divided into four dwellings, each fairly commodious by Greek
standards, though there are of course larger and smaller dwellings. In addition to
defence and public buildings and spaces, careful thought in establishing the city was
given to a public water supply. The water was brought into Priene from the moun
tains by aqueduct and collected in settling tanks, from which earthenware pipes
distributed it to stone fountains set in the walls of buildings throughout the city
(Akurgal 1990: 187; Owens 1991: 65±6). Over all, we clearly see a very well
organized, well set up small city (figure 12.2). It had all the basic physical features
and amenities to be expected of a Hellenistic Greek city, often in an unusually fine
form. Accessible by highways from east and west, it enjoyed a beautiful view over the
Gulf of Latmos to the headland on which sat Miletos to the south; and a small port
town, Naulochos, lay not far away. Based on the number of housing blocks provided
by the axial-grid street system, one can estimate the number of private dwellings as
somewhere around 260 (about 65 or so housing blocks with on average four
dwellings per block); if one guesses at around 10±12 inhabitants per dwelling (family,
dependents, slaves) that would give a very approximate population for the city of
Priene of 2600 to 3000. Definitely a small town, therefore, though for the state
of Priene one should of course add the population of the territory of the city-state,
including subsidiar y towns like the aforementioned Naulochos.
Ephesos was, like Priene, an ancient Ionian city re-founded at the beginning of
the Hellenistic era, but a very much larger and more important one. The initiative in
re-founding Ephesos came, according to our sources, from the Diadoch L ysimachos,
who ruled Asia Minor from 301 until his death in battle in 281. The city was
apparently in decline at its original site, probably as a result of silting by the river
Kaystros on which it lay, and the site chosen by L ysimachos was by universal acclaim
far superior: certainly Ephesos flourished in its new location and became one of the
largest and most prosperous cities of the Hellenistic and Roman world. The topog
raphy of Ephesos is very different than that of Priene, and likewise therefore the town
planning. Ephesos was built on the coast in a valley between two hills: Mt. Pion
(modern Panayirdag) to the north and east and Mt. Koressos (modern Bulbuldag) to

the south. The city has two parts: an upper city on the west slope of Mt. Pion and in
the valley between Pion and Koressos, and a lower city along the coast in front of and
around the harbour (figure 12.3). One of the best preserved and most thoroughly
excavated ancient cities, as a result of successive Austrian archaeological expeditions
between 1895 and the present day (Akurgal 1990: 142±71, 354±60), it is neverthe
less the case that the very extensive Roman overlay ± the vast majority of the buildings

visible today are of Roman date ± prevents us from knowing as much as we would like
about Hellenistic Ephesos. However, as far as town planning goes, there can be no
doubt that the basic arrangement of the city was set in the Hellenistic period, the
Romans merely expanding or adding to what was already there.
The layout of Ephesos was af fected not only by the topography of the two hills
between which it lay and the harbour in front, but also by the hugely impor tant
suburban temple of Ar temis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The
main avenue of Ephesos, around which the street plan was established, was oriented
with both the temple of Artemis and the local topography in mind. A processional
way, beginning at the temple, ran more or less directly south until it reached the
eastern `Magnesian Gate' of the city, between the slopes of Pion and Koressos; there it
turned west, entering the city and proceeding at an angle slightly nor th of due west
along the valley between the hills until it reached the open harbour plain in front of
Mt. Pion; there it turned nor th along the west front of Pion to the nor th gate of the
city, from where it turned east and regained the temple of Ar temis. It was from this
non-axial avenue that the street grid of Ephesos radiated out, in two basic patterns. In
Cities 203



Figure 12.3 Plan of Roman Ephesos, following the arrangement of the Hellenistic city; after
W. Oberleitner
the upper city, between the hills, streets branched off and climbed the slopes on either
side in a basically axial way, though not meeting the avenue at the normal right angle;
in the lower city the axiality was more complete, as streets branched of f from the
avenue at right angles to the west, and were in turn intersected by subsidiar y nor th±
south streets. Most impor tant was the great colonnaded street later called the
`Arkadiane' (after it was rebuilt and decorated by the emperor Arcadius) that led
straight down to the harbour, bisecting the lower city. This urban layout, of course,
meant that the public buildings and spaces of Ephesos could not, as in Priene, be
concentrated in a central location; instead they were divided between the upper and
lower cities, but always sited in relation to the main avenue and its subsidiar y, the
`Arkadiane'.
In the upper city, as one walked into the town along the avenue from the Magnes
ian Gate, one came to the political centre of the city: the mainagora, with stoas along
its sides and, on the north, a bouleuterion in the form of a small auditorium and beside
it the pr ytaneion: though the sur viving edifices are all of Roman imperial date,
Hellenistic remains have been found under the agora and its nor th stoa, and it is
most likely that Hellenistic predecessors underlie all of these buildings. In the lower
city were placed an array of commercial and cultural spaces and buildings. At the
point where the main avenue turns north lies, to its west, a secondagora intended for
commercial use and linked to the harbour by the `Arkadiane'. Originally built in
Hellenistic times, its sur viving architecture dates to the time of Augustus. Diagonally
across from the commercial market square, built into the west slope of Mt. Pion, lies
204 Richard Billows

the magnificent theatre, one of the most beautiful and best preser ved of its kind. Its
plan and the first two of its three tiers of seating are Hellenistic, though in Roman
times it was expanded with a built-up skene and a third tier of seats. At its largest, it
could seat 24,000, giving an indication of the large population of late Hellenistic
and Roman Ephesos, presumably well over 100,000 (Figure 12.4). The stadium of
Ephesos, near the nor th gate, is Roman, but ver y likely on the site of a Hellenistic
predecessor; the four gymnasia ± near the Magnesian gate, near the harbour, near the
theatre and just inside the nor th gate next to the stadium ± are likewise all Roman,
but obviously several of them continue Hellenistic gymnasia. Though, again, the
sur viving water works of the city are mostly Roman, Hellenistic fountain houses do
sur vive near the theatre at the junction of the main avenue and the `Arkadiane', and
just before the avenue enters the agora in the upper city, making it clear that the city's
water supply was well attended to in the Hellenistic period. Besides the theatre, the
most impressive visible remnant of Hellenistic Ephesos is without doubt the long
stretch of fortification wall on the ridge of Mt. Koressos (another small angle of
L ysimachos' wall sur vives at the nor th-east corner of Mt. Pion).
The harbour was one of the most important features of ancient Ephesos, deter
mining its location and giving it its impor tance and prosperity. Though it is today
completely silted up, its outline is still clearly visible on the ground, especially from
the upper seats of the theatre which overlooks it. A long narrow channel from the sea
opened up into a large, almost circular basin providing one of the finest sheltered
harbours on the west coast of Asia Minor. Besides the great colonnaded avenue and
Cities 205



the magnificent commercial
agora
to which it led, it is clear that some of the bathing
and exercise complexes near the harbour ser ved the commercial visitors who
thronged Ephesos in Roman times, as did a variety of less public establishments
such as brothels and the souvenir shops selling religious paraphernalia connected
with Ar temis/Diana attested in the
Acts of the Apostles
(19.23±7). We can reasonably
guess again, that these will have had Hellenistic predecessors. The private housing was
located, in the upper city, on the slopes of Pion and Koressos leading up from the
main avenue and, in the lower city, mostly to the nor th of the harbour. All in all,
Ephesos was clearly a large, successful and magnificently planned and appointed city,
one of the jewels of Hellenistic city planning.
Unlike Priene and Ephesos, Pergamon was not an ancient city re-founded in the
Hellenistic period. Though it had clearly existed for centuries before the Hellenistic
era, it was essentially a for tified outpost on a prominent hill overlooking the lower
Kaikos valley until it came under the control of the Attalid dynasty who, in the course
of the third and second centuries, built it up into the capital city of a small but wealthy
kingdom in the nor th-west corner of Asia Minor which, at its height under Roman
patronage between 189 and 133, controlled all of western Asia Minor. In terms of
layout, it is vir tually the opposite of Ephesos: as we have seen, Ephesos lay in a coastal
plain and valley in front of and between two hills, and spread up their slopes;
Pergamon lay on the top of a substantial hill and spread down its slopes. This imposed
a ver y dif ferent town plan, and as a result Pergamon is the least axial of the three cities
here examined in detail (figure 12.5). The natural topography divides Pergamon into
an upper, a middle and a lower city. As at Ephesos, there is substantial Roman overlay
masking the Hellenistic city, but the German excavations of the late nineteenth and
twentieth centuries under, successively, Humann, DÈ o rpfeld, Wiegand and (now)
Radt enable us to grasp the city plan quite well. The lower city is essentially of
Roman date, though there was likely some suburban habitation in the area in
Hellenistic times, and the great suburban sanctuar y of Asklepios, which attained
widespread renown in the Roman period, cer tainly dates back to the third centur y
at least. The Hellenistic city proper was restricted to the upper and middle regions, on
the crest and slopes of the hill of Pergamon (Akurgal 1990: 69±111, 360±1). The
division between upper and middle cities is not just topographical: it also corres
ponded to social and political realities of Pergamon: the upper city had at its core the
royal palace and militar y complexes, and was rounded out by various public buildings
and spaces; the middle city held the main residential quar ters, but also a number of
impor tant public complexes.
Notewor thy is that we find at Pergamon the same division into two distinct
agorai
of political (upper city) and commercial (middle city) functions that we saw at
Ephesos and, in rather embr yonic form, at Priene. The crest of the hill, or acropolis,
forms a long slightly cur ving terrace roughly nor th±south in orientation. The nor th
ern two-thirds or so are taken up by the royal compound. At the extreme nor th end
lay a set of arsenals; to the south of them, along the eastern side of the hill, lay
barracks and of ficers' housing; and to the south of them again lay royal palaces built
by various kings of the dynasty. On the nor th-west side of the acropolis, across from
the barracks and of ficers' quar ters, stands the temple of Trajan built in the reign of
Hadrian. Whatever Hellenistic building originally lay here was thoroughly destroyed
by the levelling of the site for the Trajaneum. To the south of this temple, across from

Figure 12.5 Plan of Pergamon, built by the Attalids in the third century; after E. Akurgal
the royal palaces, lay one of the most interesting buildings in Pergamon, the great
library; modelled on the famous library of Alexandria, it is said to have contained
upwards of 200,000 books at its peak, before many volumes were removed to
Alexandria on the orders of Mark Anthony, to replace losses to the great library
of the Ptolemies. The librar y begins the sequence of public buildings and spaces
filling the southern end of the acropolis, for access to it was from the second floor of a
stoa built along the northern side of the sanctuar y of Athena, patron goddess of the
city. This sanctuary consisted of a large open square with stoas on its north, east and
south sides, and on the west, set at a slight angle, the Doric temple of Athena of early
third century date. To the south of this sanctuar y again lay yet another stoa, two
aisled, of late Hellenistic date. South-west from this stoa was a row of shops facing
Cities 207



south and overlooking a Heroon in honour of kings Attalos I and Eumenes II. To the
south-east lay a sanctuar y of Zeus with the famous great altar at its centre, whose
remains now adorn the Berlin Museum; and below it the extensive political agora,
colonnaded and with a small temple at its nor th-east end.
The upper city is thus seen to be largely a display piece of royal and public
buildings, fulfilling security, religious, cultural and political functions and making a
proud crown to this great city. On the west slope of the hill, this public area was
rounded of f by a magnificent theatre and temple complex. Built into the slope of the
hill was perhaps the most unusual Greek theatre known to us: to fit the topography, it
was built with an almost ver tiginous steepness, and it cur ved much less than 180
degrees, rather than the normal 190±200. It consisted of 80 rows of seats, and held
some 10,000 spectators. The upper city, which like the theatre faced west, was in
ef fect cur ved around the theatre which thus formed its centrepiece, and af forded the
spectators a magnificent view west across the coastal plain to the sea. At the base of
the theatre was a terrace running nor th±south and providing an access road, with
stoas on either side, from the agora in the south to the theatre, and then beyond it to
a small temple of Dionysos, patron god of Greek drama, at the nor th end of the
terrace. The skene of the theatre was set up, on a temporar y basis whenever dramas
were staged, on this terrace.
Some little way down the hill from the acropolis, in the midst of the basically
residential middle city, there is a second large group of public buildings which
included ± as one descends the city ± a temple of Demeter, the pr ytaneion, a
magnificent three par t gymnasium complex and a second agora surrounded by
stoas and undoubtedly intended for commercial purposes. There were also two
monumental fountains, and the upper gymnasium included an auditorium that
may, given its size and location next to the pr ytaneion, have ser ved when needed as
a bouleuterion, though it should be noted that like much of the sur viving architecture
of the upper gymnasium, it is of Roman date. Magnificent Hellenistic for tification
walls, of which substantial sections still remain, surrounded the middle city. The
three-par t gymnasium is one of the most remarkable structures of Pergamon. The
upper gymnasium, the largest and most elaborate of the three, was for general use by
the `young men' of Pergamon, while separate gymnasia were provided for youths (the
middle gymnasium), and boys (the lower gymnasium), which probably doubled as
schools for the youngsters of the citizen class. For athletic competitions, the upper
gymnasium had an indoor running track; but a suburban stadium of Roman date may
perhaps mark the site of a Hellenistic open-air stadium. All in all, it is clear that all the
necessar y amenities of a Greek city were magnificently provided for.
What is, I think, remarkable about these cities is the degree of sameness within such
a wide variation. It is clear, in the first place, that to Greek city planners the axial-grid
system was an amenity, not a straitjacket: they readily adapted it or to a greater or
lesser degree abandoned it if the topography of the city location called for it. It is
noteworthy, in fact, how carefully Hellenistic city planning took topography into
account and made the best of the physical features of the locale, blending with them,
exploiting them, but never forcing them into the Hippodamian system where it did
not fit. Where a city was built ± on a slope, in a valley, on a hill-top ± determined its
shape and layout and therefore its par ticular character. Within this physical variety,
and the additional variety of size, we find a basic sameness. In each city, whether royal
208 Richard Billows



metropolis (Pergamon), large commercial city (Ephesos), or small provincial town
(Priene), the citizens' basic needs with respect to politics, religion, social/cultural life,
commerce and basic security found essentially the same provision in the form of
monumental public buildings and spaces: an agora with nearby pr ytaneion, bouleuter
ion and stoas to provide of fices for magistrates and the like (politics); temples and
sanctuaries (religion); a gymnasium or gymnasia, a theatre, a stadium and sometimes
another auditorium or a librar y (social/cultural life); a commercialagora with stoas to
provide rooms for shops (commerce); city walls and an ample and well set-up water
supply (basic security). These buildings and spaces might dif fer in number and size
according to the size of the city and its population, but they clearly conformed to the
same overall conception of what a city should be. It was a conception that found
expression, as I noted above, in literar y works; and it was also worked out in a whole
variety of other ways in the life of the community.
3 Civic Life and Urban Culture
Associated with the various forms of physical infrastructure that made up the city were
an array of political and cultural institutions and norms that framed and shaped the
life of the citizens in their communities. During the Hellenistic period the notion that
democracy was the only appropriate form of constitution for an autonomous Greek
city became par t of Greek urban culture (Musti 1966; Quass 1979; Gruen 1993b;
O'Neil 1995: chapter 5). Along with the political form of democracy, borrowed
essentially from classical Athens, went another borrowing from fifth- and fourth
centur y Athens: the so-called `epigraphic habit'. Democratic government required
public record keeping in order for laws, institutions, policies and the like to be out in
the open and retained in the public memor y. The way the Greeks kept and published
civic records was to inscribe them in stone, either on the walls of temples and other
public buildings, or on stelae set up in cult sanctuaries, on the acropolis, or in the
agora. As a result, we possess enormous numbers of inscriptions from the Hellenistic
era documenting, among other things, how the Greek cities functioned and were
governed. From them we can see that Hellenistic cities prized their local autonomy
and democratic institutions greatly, that government by duly elected or appointed
magistrates, state council and assembly of citizens was vir tually universal, and that
the magistrates, councils and assemblies of the Hellenistic cities were kept ver y busy.
We can see that, limited as the autonomy of Greek cities was due to the realities of
imperial power, the local self-governance was real. It was concerned primarily with six
main issues: religious matters and festivals, relations with kings and dynasts, relations
with other cities, honouring benefactors, the food supply and the upkeep of public
buildings and amenities. Although the public business of Hellenistic cities is some
times dismissed as unimportant trifling compared to the issues of real significance
dealt with by classical city-states like Athens and Spar ta (e.g. by Green 1990: 155±
70), it should be clear from the above list that matters of real impor t to the citizens
were routinely dealt with; and in any case that attitude overstates the freedom of most
classical city-states ± for Athens and Spar ta were exceptions, and most cities never had
much more real autonomy than they had in the Hellenistic era.
What we can see from the epigraphic evidence is that, though Greek cities never at
any time developed proper administrative bureaucracies, there was in the Hellenistic
Cities 209



era a considerable elaboration of the civic magistracies charged with overseeing the
various aspects of public life and business, and that the amenities and ser vices cities
provided their citizens likewise became more elaborate. One of the best (and most
frequently cited and quoted) pieces of evidence in this regard is a long inscription
from Pergamon recording substantial por tions of the administrative code of that city
(OGIS 483; Klaf fenbach 1954; Austin 216 trans.). There are detailed instructions for
upkeep of the road network in and around the city, specifying the minimum width of
main roads (c. 30 ft.) and side roads (c. 12 ft.). The astynomoi (city wardens) are
charged with chief responsibility for this, with under them street governors ( ampho
darchai) who have actual oversight of ensuring that the city streets are clean and in
good repair. Those owning property along the streets are required to pay for the
actual work of cleaning and repairing them when necessar y, with the amphodarchai
overseeing them, and if necessar y the astynomoi stepping in to contract the work out
and exact the money to cover the resulting expense from the proper ty owners. Over
the astynomoi, to ensure that they do their job, are the strategoi (lit. generals, the
city's chief magistrates) and the nomophylakes (guardians of the law). Precise fines and
punishments are laid down for those at each level who fail to fulfil their responsi
bilities properly. It is strictly forbidden to damage the streets, and any such damage is
to be made good at the wrongdoers' expense. The astynomoi are further charged with
inspecting par ty walls and seeing to it that the owners keep them in good repair, with
detailed provisions for how the cost is to be allocated. The astynomoi are likewise
charged with ensuring that the public fountains are kept clean and that the flow of
water is not obstructed, and to fine heavily those who misuse them. They are also
charged with keeping a record of the water cisterns in the city and ensuring that they
are properly maintained, fining heavily owners who do not do so, and reporting on
this to the strategoi. Similarly, the city's public toilets and sewers are under their care,
with the charge to ensure that the toilets are clean and the sewers covered.
The astynomoi emerge from this document as impor tant of ficials charged with
crucial responsibilities for seeing to it that the physical fabric of the city was properly
maintained. They repor ted on this to two of the top magistracies of the city ± the
strategoi and the nomophylakes ± and had lesser magistrates ser ving under them for
specific tasks, like the aforementioned amphodarchai. Such astynomoi are met with in
inscriptions from quite an array of other cities (see e.g. the evidence cited by A. Jones
1940: 349 n. 5), and we know that they formed par t of an array of magistracies
charged with the maintenance of public amenities. The best known is no doubt the
gymnasiarchos, charged with upkeep and oversight of the gymnasium and its proper
use. Other impor tant and quite well known magistracies are: the agoranomoi, who
oversaw the marketplace and made sure that merchants and traders used proper
weights and measures, the right coinage and in general that the market place was
used fairly and peacefully; the sitophylakes or sitonai, charged with overseeing the city's
grain-storage facilities and, so far as possible, ensuring the impor t of an adequate
supply of grain to feed the population at an af fordable price; nuktostrategoi or
nuktophylakes (night generals or guards), or sometimes eirenarchai (peace wardens),
charged with the police function of maintaining public order, especially (as the title of
`night' general or guard indicates) at night ± ancient cities were not well lit after dark
(A. Jones 1940: 211±50, 348±9). One might also mention paidonomoi (child
wardens) in charge of overseeing the education of citizen boys ± and sometimes
210 Richard Billows



also girls ± in some cities, and various sorts of treasurers (tamiai) in charge of the
receipt and disbursement of public funds.
In general, it is plain that Hellenistic cities were rather well and carefully governed
and maintained by a whole network and hierarchy of magistracies which collectively
saw to it that the city looked good and functioned smoothly, and that the needs of the
citizens were taken care of. All of these magistrates were appointed by the citizen
body, and were ultimately responsible to the citizen assembly for the proper fulfil
ment of their duties. Again it is clear from this that the self-governance of Hellenistic
cities was not an empty honour (as for instance Green 1990: 155), but that the citizen
assemblies had matters of real impor tance to them upon which to deliberate and
decide at their meetings. It comes as no surprise, therefore, to find that evidence
exists to show that assemblies were well attended. Records of voters present at
assemblies, or of citizens voting in favour of a measure, are known from various cities
± Halikarnassos, Magnesia-on-the-Maeander and Kolophon for instance ± and the
numbers given are large enough to indicate that a substantial percentage of citizens
frequently attended (Gauthier 1984: 96±7; Gruen 1993b; 354). However, discussion
of magistracies and citizen assemblies, impor tant as they were to the functioning of
the cities, gives only par t of the picture of how the cities were run.
One of the characteristic features of Greek cities, in the Hellenistic no less than in
the Classical period and earlier, was that they tended to have rather diminutive public
revenues, too small to meet all of the communities' public expenses. Just as Greeks
resisted the holding of salaried jobs, considering working regularly for another to be
demeaning (banausic) and slavish, so they also resisted the imposition of taxes on
their incomes ± irregular as they often were ± considering such taxes to be harsh and a
sign of submission on the par t of the taxpayer. Public finances therefore rested on
more irregular and unpredictable sources: market and harbour taxes, impor t and
expor t duties, sometimes proper ty taxes (usually only imposed in emergencies) and
fines and confiscations of various sor ts. Shor tfalls in the revenues needed to cover
expenses were hence chronic. The cities met this situation by appealing to the
generosity of wealthy benefactors (euergetai), fellow citizens in the first place who
had a self-interested motive to contribute to the well-being of the community, but
during the Hellenistic period also increasingly benevolent foreigners, including
dynasts and kings. A huge number of inscriptions from all around the Hellenistic
world recording the thanks and honours accorded such benefactors attests to the
practice and its impor tance (see esp. Gauthier 1984; also Veyne 1976). Almost ever y
conceivable form of public activity ± upkeep of city walls, public buildings, fountains;
provision of massage oil for the gymnasia; funding of public education; and above all,
under writing of the grain supply ± received crucial financial suppor t from wealthy
euergetai; and the rendering of proper thanks and honours to them was evidently one
of the major preoccupations of the public assemblies.
This process of benefaction and honouring should not be dismissed as an empty or
purely formulaic activity: it goes to the ver y hear t of the functioning of the cities, of
the maintenance of harmonious relations between rich and poorer citizens, of the
continuance of public spirit within the cities (Gauthier 1984; Gruen 1993b; Billows
1995: 70±80). The cities needed this active involvement by their wealthy elites, not
only to make up for their shor tfalls in public finances, but also because, in the absence
of substantial civic administrative bureaucracies, they relied on the personal business
Cities 211



staf fs and business contacts of the wealthy to get things actually done. By being
willing to give of their wealth for the public good, the rich of the Hellenistic cities
won a public goodwill and gratitude that allayed nascent resentments about the
disparity between rich and poor citizens. And the interaction between citizen assem
blies, civic magistracies and the wealthy elites in taking care of the cities' infrastruc
tures and needs showed that civic morale and public spirit remained high despite the
reduced independence of the Greek cities in the new world of Hellenistic Empires. It
is wor th quoting a few examples of the honorific decrees of this period, not just to
illustrate how the citizens thanked and honoured their benefactors, but also to show
the kinds of ser vices such benefactors per formed for their fellow citizens.
From Halikarnassos, for instance, a decree honoured those who had provided the
city with interest free loans towards the construction of a new stoa, reading in par t:
` . . . so that those who have advanced money for the stoa which the demos (people) is
dedicating to Apollo and to King Ptolemy should be known to all, the controllers
(exetastai) in whose period of of fice the stoa is completed shall inscribe on the side
wall of the stoa the names and patronymics of all those who have advanced without
interest sums of not less than 500 drachmas, prefacing the list with the words ``The
following men gave to the demos money without interest for the construction of the
stoa''. They shall inscribe first the person who gave most' (OGIS 46, trans. as Austin
100). The raising of funds by public subscription, either as here in the form of an
interest free loan or as an outright gift, was a common way for Hellenistic cities to
meet special needs of all kinds and is widely attested (Migeotte 1992). Another form
of benefaction was the donation of large capital sums to be invested on behalf of the
city, the proceeds to finance special civic ser vices. This form of benefaction was used
in several cities that we know of to create public schools, for example, at which the
sons ± and in at least one case the daughters too ± of the citizens could receive a free
education (Miletos: SIG
3 577, trans. Austin 119; Teos: SIG
3 578, trans. Austin 120).
One of the most impor tant benefactions reflected in the sur viving honorific decrees
was the provision of help with the cities' grain supply. A decree from Delos, for
example, honours one Aristoboulos of Thessalonike, asitones of the Macedonian king
Demetrios II for help given to the Delians while he resided there in his capacity of
grain purchaser for the king (Durrbach 1921: no. 48, trans. Austin 114); but a decree
from the city of Histiaia on Euboia honouring a Rhodian for helping with the grain
supply is par ticularly revealing:
The archontes proposed that the boule (council) submit to the demos (people) this
resolution: whereas Athenodoros son of Peisagoras the Rhodian continues to provide
ser vices, both privately to any citizen in need, and publicly to the city; and whereas he
provided ready aid in ever y way to the sitonai sent by the city to Delos, lending them
money without interest and enabling them to carr y out their duties as quickly as possible,
placing the good of the city above his own private gain; therefore, so that all may know
that the demos of the Histiaians knows how to honour its benefactors, and more people
may compete to provide benefits to the city when they see wor thy men being honoured;
with good for tune, be it decided by the demos to honour Athenodoros son of Peisagoras
the Rhodian for his goodwill towards the city and to crown him with an olive wreath for
his excellence and his goodwill towards the demos of the Histiaians, to proclaim the
crown at the festival of the Antigoneia, and that the agonothetes (official in charge of the
festival) shall see to the proclamation; to grant to him and to his descendants citizenship
212 Richard Billows



according to the law and priority access to the boule and the demos, first after sacred
matters; to inscribe this decree on a stone stele and set it up here (Histiaia) in the
sanctuar y of Dionysos and at Delos in the sanctuar y of Apollo after requesting a place
from the koinon of the Delians; the expense for the inscription shall be covered by the
presiding treasurer. (SIG 3 493)
Par ticularly notewor thy here is the clause in which the Histiaians expressed the hope
that others would compete to benefit their city when they saw that the Histiaians
knew how to render proper thanks and honours: Greek culture was always highly
competitive, and like ever ything else public benefactions were seen as a competition,
a competition for honour ± indeed this competition to benefit the city and so
win honour was likened by the Athenian orator Aischines (3.180) to the competition
among athletes at the Olympic games. The Greek cities manipulated this competi
tion for honour in order to extract benefactions from the wealthy; and this system
of euergetism and associated honours was extended to relations between cities and
kings. The Greek philosophy of kingship required the king to be a euergetes, and
seeing that the kings had adopted this public pose the cities called their bluf f
and manipulated them into granting a wide array of privileges and benefactions,
making them live up to the benefactor image they wished to sustain (Billows 1995:
70±80). In this way, relations between kings and cities remained mostly cordial and
respectful throughout the Hellenistic era, despite the often rather severe restrictions
the kings placed on civic freedom. Cities also helped each other, pursuing this same
philosophy of euergetism in a dif ferent sphere. One of the hallmarks of the Hellenistic
Era is the high degree of interconnectedness the community of Greek cities displayed
(see especially Giovannini 1993 for this). They passed decrees declaring each other's
cults and temples to be `holy and inviolate' (Rigsby 1996); they made so-called
isopoliteia agreements, creating a limited form of shared citizenship among the
contracting cities (Gawantka 1975); they arbitrated disputes for each other, helping
to decrease greatly the instances of war fare between rival cities (Ager 1996); they sent
panels of citizens to act as judges in nearby cities, clearing up backlogs of cour t cases
that many cities found it hard to cope with themselves (Crowther 1995; 1998; 1999).
There was, in other words, a genuine sense of a community of cities with shared
language, culture, religion, institutions, ideals, values; a community of cities that
ought to get along and interact in a friendly and peaceful way, that ought to help
each other and respect each other. Of course there was still a great deal of inter-city
hostility and rivalr y, and wars were still fought; but the expectation, the norm even,
clearly was for peaceful and friendly interaction unless strong reasons existed to go
against that.
In conclusion, I want to emphasize that by the Hellenistic Era there had emerged
in Greek culture an idea of what a city ought to be, of a set of physical, social, political,
cultural and religious structures, amenities, institutions, norms and practices to which
all cities ought to adhere. This was not just an idea: it is ver y clear that the Hellenistic
cities strove mightily to make it a reality. I will bring for ward one final piece of
evidence to illustrate this fact, and provide a fitting close to this chapter. It has long
been pointed out that in the Hellenistic period the gymnasium became the most
characteristic institution of social and cultural life in the cities, that frequenting the
gymnasium was the hallmark ± the sine qua non almost ± of the Greek citizen (so e.g.
Cities 213



Davies 1984: 308; Giovannini 1993; also Green 1990: 319, with a characteristically
negative cast). We happen to have preser ved for us an inscription of the early second
centur y B C from the town of Beroia in Macedonia, recording the citizens' decision to
establish a law regulating in detail the running of the gymnasium (Hatzopoulos and
Gauthier 1993; Austin 118, trans.). The preamble to this law makes interesting
reading: `When Hippokrates son of Nikokrates was strategos, on the 19
th of Apellaios,
at a meeting of the assembly, Zopyros son of Amyntas the gymnasiarch, Asklepiades
son of Heras, and Kallipos son of Hippostratos proposed: since all the other magis
tracies are exercised in accordance with the law, and in the cities in which there are
gymnasia and anointing is practised the laws on gymnasiarchs are deposited in the
public archives, it is therefore appropriate that the same should be done among us and
that the law which we handed over to the auditors (exetastai) should be inscribed on a
stele and placed in the gymnasium and also deposited in the public of fice. . . ' The
people of Beroia, that is to say, had become aware of an anomaly: in other Greek cities
how the gymnasium was run, who had access and when, the precise duties of the
gymnasiarch, and so on, were set out in a written law displayed for all to see; Beroia
lacked such a law. This anomaly needed to be addressed: in order for Beroia to take its
place as a full-fledged polis in the community of Greek poleis it too should have such a
law. The law was duly passed and inscribed, and happens to have sur vived through the
centuries down to our own time as an eloquent witness to the fact that Hellenistic
Greek cities strove to conform to an ideal of what a city ought to be, and made that
ideal a reality so far as they could achieve it.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Past in a Hellenistic Present:
Myth and Local Tradition
Tanja S. Scheer
1 Myth as History According to the Greeks
The inhabitants of the city of Tarsos in Cilicia, according to the geographer Strabo,
originally came from Argos: `They say that Triptolemos was sent by the Argives in
search of Io, who first disappeared in Tyre, and that he travelled through Cilicia; there
several of his Argive companions left him and founded Tarsos' (16.2.5). The strange
foundation myth of the Tarsians is a typical example of how people in the Hellenistic
period dealt with past and present. We hear for the first time that a search par ty was
sent out to find the Argive princess and priestess Io. It must have seemed ver y curious
to exper ts in Greek mythology ± and ever y citizen of a polis counted himself as such ±
that Triptolemos should have taken on such a task, that ended finally in the founding
of cities in distant, barbaric places.
The relationship of Hellenistic Greeks to their past is shaped by much older
traditions. In par ticular two impor tant points characterize the relationship to the
past: its genealogical structuring and its re-shaping by epic poetr y. It is already clear
from the Homeric epics that the Greeks thought in familial structures: `Who are you?
Where do you come from? What is the name of your home city and your parents?'
These questions are posed in epic when strangers meet (e.g. Hom. Od. 1.170). Self
definition as well as assessment by others are marked by genealogical connections.
The past of his own family, of his home city, of his tribe defines the identity and status
of the individual in the present: Glaukos and Diomedes find out on the battlefield
that their families are bound together by ancestral ties of guest-friendship (Hom.Il.
6.234±6). Even much later individuals in Greece set great store by ancestr y. But
whole cities also prided themselves on their ancestors and founders. Xenophon makes
Sokrates praise the outstanding descent of the Athenians (Xen. Mem. 3.5.3) and the
whole city allegedly talks about the supposed divine origin of the young Athenian
L ysis (Plato L ysis 205c). Herodotos repor ts that other nations occasionally outdo the
Greeks in genealogical ambition, namely when an Egyptian priest responds merely
with a smile to the ancestral line of Hekataios of Miletos, which reaches back sixteen
generations (Hdt. 2.143). The past in the form of genealogy had an ef fect right up to



the present in Greece through the emphasizing of family structures: it gave rise to
expectations and claims. These might for instance have consisted of territorial claims,
but might also have applied to `familial behaviour': allied cities and families were
expected to stand by each other in war or in economic crises.
This pronounced Greek interest in ancestr y and kinship was, however, not properly
historical. The past was only of impor tance when it was marked by famous personal
ities or by deeds of mythical heroes. A family tree that ended with an anonymous
smallholder was of little use. Even as proof of the great age of a family it could not
of fer much help: for great age only really began when the genealogy could be traced
back to heroic times and thereby into the society of heroes or even gods (Strubbe
1984; Weiû 1984; Scheer 1993: 6f f.; Gehrke 1994).
Even if there had been a general interest in the authentic past, if the Greeks had
looked for objective answers, the problems with the sources would have quickly
driven them to the limits of possibility (Forsdyke 1956: 13; Patzek 1992: 2f f.) The
knowledge of Linear B script had been lost. People were at a loss when confronted
with written or archaeological discoveries from their own past, which chance had
brought to light. The Greeks reconstructed the past not so much through concrete
evidence from early times but rather with the help of their traditional stories, of myth.
In cases of doubt an oracle was readily consulted, for instance when they sought
an explanation for the discover y of colossal bones. The answers were bound by
the framework of established tradition. It might then emerge for instance that they
were dealing with the kneecap of Ajax, son of Telamon, from the Homeric epic or the
skeleton of the giant Orontes, which at the same time would provide a plausible
explanation for the colossal size of the finds (Pfister 1909±12: 507f f.; Scheer 1996:
354f f.). Similar explanations probably presented themselves in the case of visible
remains of buildings from the Mycenean Age (Hampl 1975: 75; Tausend 1990:
152). Questions about the past led to heroic, not historically correct, answers (see
also Dowden 1992: 60f f.; Sour vinou-Inwood 1987: 215±16). The possibility is not
absolutely excluded that historical memor y has here and there preser ved the reality of
early Greece. Already long before Hellenistic times, however, Greek logographers and
historians had made the fictional events of epic the focal point of their histor y and
accepted them as containing at least a core of truth. Even Thucydides speaks of the
autochthony of the Athenians, of the naval supremacy of King Minos, and of the
Trojan War as historical facts from which one only needs to expunge the improbable
additions (Thuc. 1.2.5; 1.4.1; 1.9.1). The swift spread of the Homeric epics through
out Greece had clearly extinguished or at least `reshaped' real memor y. The memor y
of a more or less exiguous real past was hardly a match for the epic alternative of
heroic mar tial renown (Strasburger 1972: 15±16; Scheer 1993: 62).
The connection between epic and self-definition through heredity is established
without dif ficulty if one stresses the role of the ancestors of cities and of individuals in
specific mythological incidents. Mythical tradition becomes mythical construct.
Already in the ancient world the Athenians saw themselves confronted with the
accusation that they had inser ted supposedly appropriate lines into theIliad (Hereas
of Megara FGrH 486 F1; Plut. Sol. 10). Or else individual families traced their
ancestr y in a direct line back to epic heroes: the family of the Philaides, to which
the historian Thucydides belonged, claimed to be descended from Ajax, son of
Telamon (Hdt. 6.35; Pherekydes FGrH 3 F2), the orator Andokides even claimed
The Past in a Hellenistic Present 217



descent from Odysseus and Hermes (Plut. Alc
. 21; [Plut.] Mor
. 834b). The habit of
evaluating the qualities of individuals and even of cities on the basis of their ancestr y
understandably encouraged the desire to number the gods themselves ± or at least the
heroes of epic ± among one's own ancestors.
2 Past and Present in the Hellenistic Period
The interconnection of past and present reached hither to unprecedented levels in the
Hellenistic period. The basic constants remained the same: the interest in genealogy
continued unabated, and the past as re-fashioned by epic, in which the products of
the poetic imagination have taken the place of reality, is established and recognized as
a valid representation of the Greek past. What changed and developed, however, was
the role that the past played in the present. The immediate cause of this was the
upheaval brought about by the campaigns of Alexander the Great.
In his treatment of the past Alexander connected seamlessly with the traditional
perception. Already for generations the Argeads had attached great value to a
prestigious ancestral line that went right back to Herakles as its progenitor. The
Macedonian royal house, at first not recognized as truly Greek, found it par ticularly
necessar y to claim mythological-cum-historical proof of their noble descent. It was
the propagation of a family tree which went back to Argos and Herakles that made
possible their admission to the Olympic Games (Hdt. 5.22; 8.137±9; Thuc. 2.99.3).
At the time of Philip II this ancestr y was largely recognized (though for dissent, see
Dem. 9.31) and significantly in his case it also had an influence on the present; the
histor y of the family imposed an obligation. Thus the political writer Isokrates could
present Herakles as a model for his descendant Philip ( Panath
. 76±7). The deeds of
Herakles in the first conquest of Troy were used to legitimate, and also to oblige,
Philip to carr y out successful militar y action in the present ± that is the campaign
against the Persians (Isoc. Phil
. 111±15). The young Alexander through his mother,
the Epeirote princess Olympias, also counted Achilles, Homer's most courageous
hero at Troy, among his ancestors (Paus. 1.11.1; Funke 2000: 167). Through Hera
kles and Achilles, therefore, Alexander was of divine descent both on his father's and
on his mother's side: he had the sea-goddess Thetis, the mother of Achilles, and Zeus,
king of the gods, the father of Herakles, in his family tree. Alexander as king empha
sized his connection to a divine, or at least glorious heroic, past not only through his
own ancestr y but also through his conduct. His campaign against the Persians could
already be regarded ± completely in the tradition of Philip ± as a war of vengeance
designed to punish the outrage previously committed by the Persians in Greece
(Polyb. 5.10.8; Diod. 17.4.9; Just. 11.2.5; Bellen 1974). Fur thermore, the action
was permeated with repeated allusions to the mythical past. He presented himself as a
new fighter against Troy: when he landed on Asiatic soil, he leapt from his ship, like
Protesilaos before him, and hurled his spear as a gesture of ownership into enemy
ground. In addition he pointedly visited the sites of ancient Ilion and sacrificed in the
temple of Athena. He had Trojan weapons from this temple carried ahead of him as a
standard from then on, a consequence of his well-documented personal interest in the
epic that praised his ancestor Achilles (Arr. Anab
. 1.11.6±12.2; Plut. Alex
. 5.8). The
continued influence of the mythological past on the present is clear: it is the motivat
ing yardstick for the new Achilles (Stewart 1993a: 78±86; Erskine 2001: 226±31).
218 Tanja S. Scheer



3 The Greeks Abroad
In the course of Alexander's campaigns the interaction of past and present gained a
new dimension. The advance of the Macedonian army changed the Greek view of the
world (cf. Geus, this volume). The way they dealt with this expanded, apparently
endless, world is significant: they evidently abstained from extravagant adver tisement
of the claim to be the first to have ever advanced so far. Instead the stress was placed
over and over again on familiar elements in these foreign lands: the geographical
opening up of the world took place in the footsteps of great forerunners, of gods and
heroes from the mythical past.
Throughout his campaign Alexander recognized Greek gods and heroes in foreign
lands; he called on them pointedly and paid honour to them. He recognized his
ancestor Herakles in the Phoenician Melqar t of Tyre. In remote Cilicia he sacrificed
to the Asklepios of Soloi and hailed the hero Amphilochos of Mallos as a direct
relation (Arr. Anab. 2.16.7; 2.5.5; 2.5.9). The whole campaign of Alexander can be
interpreted as a venture following the trail of the mythical past: like Herakles, who
had travelled the world and fought against the barbarians, Alexander too took up the
fight with the barbarian foe. In the footsteps of Dionysos he travelled to India,
beyond the boundaries of the known world (Arr. Ind. 1.4±5; 5.12).
In the case of Alexander's campaigns this emphasis on the mythical past of the
Macedonians and Greeks tended to integrate rather than exclude. The aim was by no
means a one-sided ennobling of the Macedonians at the expense of the indigenous
peoples whom they encountered. Family relationships based on myth did not have
the function of an exclusive patent of nobility. Alexander and his generals endeav
oured on the contrar y to establish a connection between Greeks and Persians. Strabo
records the creation of a family relationship between the Thessalians and the inhabit
ants of Armenia and Media which was promoted by followers of Alexander
(11.14.12). This idea of kinship between the inhabitants of Asia and the Greeks
was not completely new. Already in the Homeric epic Greek gods had sons in both
camps: one thinks of Aeneas, Sarpedon and Memnon. Herodotos had already
repor ted that the kings of L ydia were descended from Herakles (1.7). And in the
run up to the Persian Wars Persian envoys are supposed to have come to Argos in an
attempt to win the Argives over to their side ± by appealing to their mutual mythical
ancestor Perseus (Hdt. 7.150; Braun 1982: 31; Speyer 1989).
This integrating use of the mythical past was not simply an unselfish mark of respect
or recognition for non-Greek civilizations on the par t of the Greeks. At stake surely
was the need to prevent the Greek claim to power from appearing to the conquered as
foreign rule. At least as impor tant, however, was the oppor tunity for the Greeks to
take mental possession of these new lands. In this aim the structure of the traditional
stories of the Greeks was of considerable assistance. A common method of intellectual
subjugation of unfamiliar lands consisted in making them accessible through
eponymous heroes: ever y river, ever y tree, ever y region, according to the Greek
view, was inhabited by local supernatural powers. Once the areas which they reached
were mythically personalized, then the local family trees could easily be connected to
well-known Greek heroes. Indeed if it was possible to recognize a prominent Greek
hero as progenitor, then the new members could be regarded as having been success
fully fitted into the system. But in addition the propagation of parallels between
The Past in a Hellenistic Present 219



Alexander and successful models from the past must have had positive consequences.
The example of mythical wandering heroes and gods like Herakles and Dionysos, in
whose footsteps they could imagine themselves to be following, helped the Macedo
nians cope with the pressures of an alien environment. The foreign land was not really
unknown: their own ancestors had after all once passed through it victoriously (Arr.
Anab. 5.26.5). The cultivation of a mythical past was valuable for the Hellenistic
present; even in the most far-flung foreign land traces of old familiar patter ns could be
discovered. Thus, the new world could be integrated into the old as something
already familiar.
The person of Alexander himself became in the end a new fixed point of the more
recent past, which in its tur n had an influence on the present. Alexander's deeds
allowed him to grow in the eyes of contemporaries and descendants to a tr uly
superhuman stature. Just as r ulers and cities had tried to obtain a share in the
Homeric epic, so they now strove to establish a link to this latterday hero, who had
proved himself to be a tr ue successor to the gods and heroes. Alexander became the
focus of competition among kings and cities; not only were genealogical claims made
but relics of the dead king were highly-prized. The desire to have a share in Alexander
led Ptolemy I, for example, to stylize himself as a descendant of Herakles and
an Argead (Theocr. Id. 17.26; Paus. 1.6.25; Cur t. 9.8.22). What is more, Ptolemy
was able to secure Alexander's corpse for his own capital city, Alexandria,
where Alexander later acquired the status of a founding hero and of a local guardian
hero, who kept watch from his tomb over the future of his foundation (Payne 1991:
170; Erskine 2002a). In the kingdom of Macedon itself the genealogical connection
to Alexander remained a central ideological element. Polybios describes the ambition
of Philip V who throughout his life had emphasized his family connection with
Alexander (5.10.10). The hard-pressed Macedonian king Perseus is supposed to
have made his ill-fated jour ney to the city of Pydna in 168, because he wanted
to make a sacrifice there to Herakles, the ancestor he shared with Alexander (Plut.
Aem. 19).
4 The Past for Kings: Hellenistic Pergamon
Alexander had already, in the course of his campaign, founded a number of cities. His
successors carried this policy fur ther: the establishment of new Greek cities in areas
hither to unexploited by the Greeks is probably rightly regarded as a par ticularly
typical element of the Hellenistic period. The kings quickly recognized the signifi
cance of cities in the territorial exploitation of defeated regions (Brodersen 2001).
Many of these new foundations were not, however, actually new. Probably only a ver y
few were really planned on the drawing-board. The places of settlement had, on the
contrar y, frequently already been settled and were now simply restr uctured by a Greek
component in the population. Several cities acquired a completely new significance as
a result. Their new political impor tance called for ideological underpinning. The past
also played an impor tant role for a Hellenistic `new foundation'. `Newness' was not a
positive factor for the Greeks ± just the opposite. This was tr ue for most spheres ±
beginning with the inauguration of customs or laws, which were attributed to the
earliest possible ancestor, and whose obligator y nature derived from their allegedly
great age; and applying also to cities and tribes who liked to claim the greatest
220 Tanja S. Scheer



possible antiquity for themselves. In the course of the following discussion the
significance of myth for past and present in the Hellenistic period will be shown
through two examples: firstly a royal capital; secondly the relationships between long
established Greek cities and others, hitherto only superficially Hellenized, situated at
the edge of the Greek world.
Greek myth and local tradition played an important role in the history of the city of
Pergamon from the beginning of the Hellenistic period. Pergamon was not a new
foundation of its first Hellenistic ruler, Philetairos. Traces of settlement go back to
second millennium B C . Already in the fifth century a place called Pergamon is
recorded in this region. The Persian king presented it to a follower from Eretria
called Gongylos (Xen. Hell. 3.1.6). But before the Hellenistic Age this settlement was
probably not a Greek city; it could not be compared with the nearby Ionic founda
tions on the west coast of Asia Minor, rich in tradition. It never became a city with a
purely Greek population; funerary inscriptions show that, even in its Hellenistic
heyday when a replica of the Athena Parthenos was set up in the Pergamene librar y,
a large part of the population still bore non-Greek personal names (Scheer 1993:
101±2). For the Hellenistic rulers, who chose the city of Pergamon as their seat, the
decisive factor was probably not some kind of ideological prestige possessed by the
place but rather the impregnability of its acropolis. The previous insignificance of the
place, its existence as a settlement in Asia Minor in the backwaters of history, was
appropriate to the humble origins of its new ruler. Philetairos, son of Attalos and Boa,
came from Tieion, a small city in Paphlagonia. His mother Boa did not even bear a
Greek name. It shows the value which the Greeks attached to personal descent when
the ancestry of the Attalid ruling family from a Paphlagonian forebear could still lead
to denigration hundreds of years later: Boa was abused by poets as a barbarian flute
girl ± after all what good could come out of Paphlagonia (Strabo 14.1.39; Athen.
13.577b)?
The rise of Pergamon to be the capital of a new, prosperous and liberal dynasty
directed an attention never before known on settlement and ruler ± and also on the
history of both (for the city, Billows, this volume, section 2; for the dynasty, Kosme
tatou, this volume). The rivals with whom it was essential to be of equal birth were
the other Hellenistic ruling families with their claims to divine or at least Argead
descent and the neighbouring Greek cities with an ancient cultural tradition. By the
reign of Attalos I, who was the first Pergamene to take the title of king, the real
ancestry of the ruling family and the real history of the settlement had long ceased to
matter in dynastic and civic self-representation. Philetairos had sent donations on a
grand scale to the most important sanctuaries of the Greek world, to Delphi, Delos
and Olympia among others. His successors were a match for him in this respect. At
the end of the third century in the sanctuary at Delos a votive offering was donated
which was of particular significance for the self-conception and self-representation of
the Attalids: the so-called Teuthrania offering (Schalles 1985: 127; Hintzen-Bohlen
1992: 146; Scheer 1993: 127). The inscriptions on the bases of five or six statues give
the name and parents of the person represented. That the Pergamene rulers Eumenes
I and Attalos I appear here is not surprising. It is interesting, however, that the rulers
of Pergamon are seen in company with eponymous local heroes from the area around
their royal capital. One of these is Midios, son of Halisarne and Gyrnos. Midios can be
identified as hero of a place called Midapedion, Halisarna was already named by
The Past in a Hellenistic Present 221



Xenophon as a place near Pergamon. In later sources Gyrnos, the father of Midios,
was explicitly described as founding hero of the sanctuar y of Apollo at Gr yneion. The
remaining inscriptions of the Teuthrania of fering also give information about the
mythological systematization to which the area around Pergamon was clearly sub
jected: one of them refers to personifications of local stretches of water. A final statue
is a representation of `Teutras'. Called `Teuthras' by the literar y sources, he was a
well-known mythical hero of the region. According to the Attic tragedians he is king
of a city called Teuthrania ± and stepfather of the famous hero Telephos.
The inscriptions of the Teuthrania of fering briefly mentioned here show how the
system of mythological genealogy can be used for the mental appropriation, incorpor
ation and ennobling of a city previously of little impor tance, and how it allows the
creation of new focus points. Features of the landscape are personalized in the form of
eponymous heroes of the past and given a genealogical connection. On the basis of
the preser ved inscriptions of the Teuthrania of fering no direct personal genealogical
connection of the royal family of Pergamon with the local heroes can be proved.
Never theless the family trees gather together local traditions from the surrounding
area and bring them closer to the new royal capital and its rulers. Visually at least the
rulers of Pergamon in the Hellenistic present and the local heroes are to be seen on
the same level. The comparatively new rulers demonstrate their attachment to the
region, as if they had been settled there since the times of Teuthras' government. The
Teuthrania of fering is located not in the Mysian hinterland nor in Pergamon itself but
in the famous ancient sanctuar y of Apollo of Delos: the whole Greek world is
addressed there in the language of myth.
The Attalid representation of the past was to go fur ther than this. In another major
Greek sanctuar y, Delphi, the ruling family's connection to an eponymous hero of
Pergamon must have played a role (Scheer 1993: 123±4). It is not clear whether
Philetairos, the founder of the dynasty, had this in mind when he made his donations
to Delphi, but Attalos I surely drew on this when endowing the sanctuar y at Delphi
with a stoa. This building, the stoa of Attalos, occupies a special position in the
sanctuar y: it is the only building allowed to interrupt the Temenos wall (Schalles
1985: 110; Jacquemin and Laroche 1992: 248±9; Hintzen-Bohlen 1992: 127), and
consequently it is situated in direct proximity to the heroon, or hero-shrine, of
Pyrrhos-Neoptolemos (Paus. 10.24.6; on the current discussion about the location
of the temenos of Neoptolemos, see Funke 2000: 88±9). Pyrrhos-Neoptolemos
played an impor tant par t in Delphi but also quite fundamentally in Homeric epic
and classical tragedy. At first he had not played a par ticularly creditable role in Delphi.
He is said to have burnt down a temple of Apollo because he blamed Apollo for
his father Achilles' death. The punishment was not long in coming: Pyrrhos
Neoptolemos died suddenly at the hands of a murderer in the sanctuar y at Delphi
(e.g. Eur. Andr. 1073±4). For the Attalids this hero was special because of his
mythological family tree. Through his father Achilles, the greatest Greek hero at
Troy, he belonged to the first rank of mythical heroes. Even more interesting,
however, were his descendants. From the Trojan booty he was awarded Andromache,
the widow of Hektor; he went with her to Epeiros and fathered three children there:
Pielos, Molossos and a son called Pergamos (Paus. 1.11.1). That the Attalids had
knowledge of this genealogy of heroes is as good as cer tain, considering their well
known cultural ambitions and their huge librar y. In addition Pausanias records a
222 Tanja S. Scheer



double shrine for Andromache and Pergamos in the city of Pergamon itself (1.11.1±
2). The proximity of the stoa of Attalos and the shrine of Pyrrhos is unlikely to be due
to chance. Pergamos of Epeiros might at first sight appear to be a rather colourless
hero, but the Attalids could see in him the eponymous hero of their city, or at least a
relative, and such a connection was open to a par ticularly honourable interpretation
according to Greek standards: the family tree of Pergamos made it possible to link the
Attalids with the most courageous heroes of both sides at Troy: to Achilles and,
through Andromache, also to the Trojan prince Hektor. Andromache also belonged
to a royal family of Asia Minor (Hom. Il. 6.395f f.). Relationship to the ancestors
of the royal family of Epeiros also brought with it a relationship that reached right
up to the Hellenistic present: with Olympias, the mother of Alexander. And just as
Alexander had justified his claim to divine and heroic ancestr y through appropriately
heroic deeds against the barbarians, so Attalos of Pergamon legitimized himself too as
a `new Pyrrhos': during the Galatian invasion of Greece in 279, according to the
Delphians, Pyrrhos-Neoptolemos had joined the battle through an epiphany and
repulsed the enemy. Attalos I, conqueror of the Gauls at the Kaikos springs, built
his stoa not without reason in the neighbourhood of the father of the eponymous
hero of Pergamon.
The local heroes of Mysia, as well as the eponymous hero Pergamos, in comparison
to the founding legends and founding heroes of the famous old Greek cities, were
rather pale figures. However the emphasis placed on the Mysian heroes by the Attalid
kings, which took the mythological names of a whole area as the basis of civic identity,
made possible the revaluation of the Pergamene past with the help of a really
prominent hero-figure of Greek myth: Telephos. He had already entered the scene
in the epic cycle ± as a successful protector of his homeland from Greek intruders,
even the equal of Achilles as a warrior. Attic tragedy, and above all the dramaTelephos
of Euripides, had conclusively moved the fate of this hero into the best-known group
of mythological material. At least since Sophocles' play The Aleades it was also clear
that the Mysian king Telephos was actually a Greek by bir th: a son of Herakles, the
greatest Greek hero, and Auge, a princess of Tegea (Scheer 1993: 71f f.).
The first definite evidence for the appropriation of Telephos by the Attalids and
simultaneously the acceptance of this mythological ancestr y by the Hellenistic present
comes from the year 209: the inhabitants of Aigina donated a statue of Telephos to
Attalos I for a joint temple with the island's hero Aiakos (Allen 1971; Scheer 1993:
127±8). The reason given for this on the inscription was: Attalos was related to Aiakos
through his descent from Herakles (i.e. through Telephos). That the city of Perga
mon had played no role in the whole previous tradition of the legend of Telephos
clearly did not disturb anyone: the city (or sometimes also the surrounding area), in
which Telephos is traditionally said to have been king, was always called Teuthrania in
the sources. A small place of this name still existed in the Hellenistic period ± but it
was not identical with the Hellenistic metropolis Pergamon. But if Pergamon had, in
the meantime, proclaimed the heroes of Mysia to be its own in the most impor tant
sanctuaries of the Greek world, so Telephos, king of Teuthrania, could also in this way
become an ancestor of the Pergamenes and of their royal family. That the ancestr y of
Telephos did not, indeed, just relate to the royal family of Pergamon is shown by the
existence of a civic tribal group called Telephis in the late Attalid period. With
Telephos as their ancestor the rulers of Pergamon had completed the historical
The Past in a Hellenistic Present 223



connection to a past wor thy of the new impor tance of their city. Appropriately the
hero's adventures found their place on the Telephos frieze of the Pergamon altar
(Bauchhenû Thu È riedl 1971; Schalles 1986; Dreyfus and Schraudolph 1996). The
comparison between this pictorial representation of the myth and the written records
shows a careful selection or adaptation of the mythological versions in circulation.
Already on the larger frieze of the altar Telephos' father Herakles appears in a central
position. The smaller Telephos frieze highlights and gives especial impor tance to
specific elements in the stor y of Telephos: for instance when the infant hero was
exposed he was not, as he was still in Sophocles, suckled by a hind but by a much
more royal beast ± by a lioness. In addition the Pergamenes placed par ticular emphasis
on their hero's Greek origin. Other versions of the Telephos myth told that the child
Telephos, along with his mother Auge, was put out to sea in a chest and came to the
Mysian coast from Arkadia via Nauplia. The native king Teuthras married Auge and
brought Telephos up as his son (Strabo 13.1.69). The Telephos frieze tells a dif ferent
stor y: after Telephos had been brought up in Greece, he came as an adult at the head
of a troop of Greek soldiers ± potential founders of cities ± to Mysia. An adult son in
search of his mother Auge, the Tegean priestess of Athena, obviously corresponded
more closely to the ideal of the Pergamene clients than the infant thrown on the
mercy of non-Greeks.
Telephos as ancestral hero guaranteed the city of Pergamon, especially through his
father Herakles, a connection with the Greek cities of the Hellenistic present ± and,
once more, with Alexander the Great. Even the origin of Telephos in the Arkadian
city of Tegea ± a rather insignificant place in Hellenistic times ± could be useful in
the matter of prestigious family connections: the Arkadians were regarded as one
of the most ancient peoples in Greece ± as ancient as the moon (Dem. 19.261). The
antiquity of Pergamene cults could also be reinforced through the Tegean connec
tion: Telephos' mother Auge was supposed to have brought the statue of the Tegean
Athena Alea with her to Pergamon (I.Perg. 156). And the myth of Telephos was also
highly suitable for a Hellenistic dynasty: the founding hero was numbered among the
Homeric kings and could trace his ancestr y back to Zeus, the king of the gods.
Telephos, son of Herakles and grandson of Zeus, had successfully defended his home
land Mysia against enemies from outside: his descendants, the kings of Pergamon,
produced the proof that his blood still flowed in their veins not least by similar heroic
deeds, such as their victor y over the Galatians, barbarians who scorned the gods.
Interesting in their treatment of their supposed civic histor y is the way the kings of
Pergamon linked up to `local' traditions. It is super fluous to give as the reason for the
choice of the Telephos legend the need to turn to authentic local figures of the
remote past (e.g. Sayce 1925; Barnett 1956; against such interpretative approaches,
U
È
nal 1991). Whether the Pergamenes knew of the existence of a Hittite mythical
figure called Telipinus is more than doubtful. They linked onto a local tradition rather
through the form set in advance by the Homeric epics: for Greek-speaking people
Mysia was above all the scene of epic events connected with the Trojan War. Ever y
authentic memor y was hopelessly inferior to this tradition. Even if the recent past of
Pergamon in the Hellenistic period was fabricated, never theless it must be accepted
that str ucturally any number of well-known mythical narratives of the Greeks could
have been considered suitable and appropriated accordingly. The Pergamenes did
not, however, make arbitrar y use of anything from the pool of stories available.
224 Tanja S. Scheer



A cer tain plausibility was required in the founding legend: it ought to permit an
inherently logical integration of one's own city into the mythical-historical system of
coordinates that helped make up the Greek world picture. This was best achieved by
recourse to pseudo-local tradition: by linking in to the picture of the landscape of
Mysia drawn by epic. At this point the question of the reception of the Pergamene
`past' and its success is posed: did Telephos, as progenitor of the Pergamenes, get
only an ironic smile in Greek cities and Hellenistic empires? Clear signs indicate
acceptance of the newly arranged Pergamene past. The people of Aigina were hardly
pleased about the new Pergamene r ule in the year 209. Never theless, they erected a
statue to Attalos with explicit reference to his relationship with them. This made it
possible for them to save face at least outwardly. One could also understand the
reference to their mutual forebear as an appeal to the new r ulers to behave towards
Aigina according to the rules of family dealings.
That the ancestr y claim of the Pergamenes also found sympathetic listeners on the
Greek mainland is shown by the reaction of the city of Tegea, the mythical bir thplace
of Auge and Telephos. Instead of jealously claiming the hero for their own histor y
and rejecting the claim of the Pergamenes as that of a usurper, Tegean envoys set of f
straightaway for Pergamon with acclamations of approval. Tegea of fered the Perga
menes mutual citizen rights (
I.Perg
. 156). The mutual conferring of civic rights on
account of the family connection with Telephos lent Pergamon's model of its past
of ficial recognition and confirmation. That the Pergamenes clearly gave the embassy
from Tegea a friendly reception is not surprising. The motives of the Tegeans are
surely to be sought both in the ideal and in the concrete sphere. Concrete was the
hope that the Attalids would prove themselves as generous in the Arkadian town as
they had been in numerous other cities on the Greek mainland. In the ideal sphere a
specifically Hellenistic development revealed itself: Tegea was indeed a famous old
city, but, as a medium-sized member of the Achaian League, it was a political
lightweight. As in Pergamon, there was a cer tain imbalance between the current
impor tance of the city and the past, to which they referred ± but in the opposite
direction. Here a possibility began to emerge of balancing this out. If the Athena of
Pergamon was a daughter cult of Tegea, this dependence raised the prestige of the
Tegean cult to a considerable degree. What applied to the sphere of the cult also
applied to the prestige of Tegea as a whole. To be the mother city of a Hellenistic
royal capital and to possess a rich, famous and influential daughter city cer tainly gave
the Tegeans a considerable increase in self-confidence in relation to their neighbour
ing cities and allies in the Achaian League.
The emphasis on ancient family relationships was, however, not just the result of
ephemeral political constellations and shor t-term oppor tunistic hopes. As the polit
ical relationships between the members of the Achaian League, to which Tegea
belonged, and Pergamon grew worse after 175, the Arkadian Telephos still continued
to be highly thought of in Pergamon. The reasons for this are indeed obvious (in spite
of the occasional astonishment of modern scholars, Ker tÂe sz 1982: 210; Bastini 1987:
129; Schindler 1988: 154): Telephos was impor tant for the Pergamenes not because
they wanted to curr y favour with the Achaian League, nor even because they wanted
to take advantage of the civic rights of Tegea. Rather the mythical forefather Telephos
gave the Pergamene dynasty, in competition with the other Hellenistic dynasties and
empires, the chance to mark out its own place. The Pergamenes did not seek to

preser ve the balance between past and present through shor t-lived political involve
ments but through par ticipation in the complex network of myth that spread across
the Greek world.
5 The Greek Past for Cilician Cities: the Race for Argos
Not only Hellenistic royal families, who wanted to claim a distinguished past as their
own, sought a connection to prominent heroes. In the Hellenistic period a large
number of cities suddenly began to emphasize their hither to unknown Greek past
with the presentation of mythical founders. The settlements on the Cilician plain in
southern Asia Minor of fer an example of this. The case of Tarsos has already been
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter; it claimed, among other things, to have
been founded by the Argives as they wandered around together with Triptolemos in
search of Io.
Up to this time Cilicia was far from being a centre of Greek civilization. In contrast
to Pergamon its cities were not situated in the neighbourhood of ancient Greek cities
rich in tradition. The Cilicians were hardly touched by the Greek colonization of the
eighth centur y and until the four th centur y they were under Persian control. From
the perspective of a Greek from the motherland the region was absolutely marginal. It
was inhabited by people who could not even speak proper Greek: the expression
`soloikizein' for someone with a strange and uncultivated accent was connected with
the Cilician city of Soloi (Strabo 14.2.28).
In the Hellenistic period a past was in great demand not only in Cilicia itself
but also along the whole south coast of Asia Minor: from Pamphylia to Syria they
all now suddenly remembered their own civic histor y (Strubbe 1984; Weiû 1984).
The focal points of this memor y are sometimes suspiciously similar. From Aspendos
in Pamphylia, Soloi, Mallos, Tarsos and Aigeai in Cilicia as far as the new Hellenistic
capital of Antioch in Syria, a common claim united them: they (along with a whole
number of further candidates) were related to the Greek city of Argos.
Practically ever ything speaks against the legitimacy of such claims. According to
our standards they are not historically correct (Scheer 1993: 337f f.). The city of
Argos did not feature prominently during the great Greek colonization. At best
Rhodian sailors and merchants had established occasional trading posts in prehelle
nistic times. Soloi, for instance, could have been such a trading post. The Cilician
cities' claim to a past did not, however, refer to the times of archaic colonization, as
the Tarsian foundation legend already makes clear. It reached fur ther back, into
mythical prehistor y, when gods and heroes were acting in person as city founders.
While no records of any kind referring to figures from Greek mythology are preser ved
for Cilician cities from archaic and classical times, that changed during the Hellenistic
period. Tarsos did not, indeed, claim to have been founded by anonymous Rhodian
sailors but by the hero Triptolemos himself.
New Argives
But what made the Tarsians, and along with them numerous other cities in the
region, think of Argos of all places as their mother city? This fact is an impor tant
indicator of the shaping of historical thought by mythological categories in the
226 Tanja S. Scheer



Hellenistic period. Argos possessed in the ancient world a considerable and ver y
special mythological prestige. Throughout the whole of ancient histor y it was
regarded as the homeland of famous mythological kings and in Attic tragedy it
became the homeland of Agamemnon. Since Homer the Argives were also famous
as descendants of Herakles. Other impor tant states in Greece, such as Rhodes and
Kos, had for a long time proudly traced their ancestr y back to the Argos of Herakles
(Hom. Il. 2.662; Strabo 14.2.6). The genealogical connection of Argos with Alexan
der, who for his own par t had stressed his descent from gods and heroes, was not only
of interest to the new rulers of Hellenistic empires but also to individual cities. The
high standing of Argos lasted until Roman imperial times. The Emperor Claudius was
still describing the citizens of Kos as Argives (Tac. Ann. 12.61). If a hierarchy of the
most distinguished cities were to be drawn up, educated people like Dion of Prusa
were of the opinion that Spar ta, Athens and Argos were the first cities of Greece (Dio
Chr ys. 44.6).
The reference to Argives offered even further oppor tunities: the Homeric epics had
created an ambiguity in the term `Argive'. Argives and Achaians were used there to
mean the same: when someone spoke of Argives they might mean the residents of the
city of Argos or the entire gathering of Greek heroes at Troy. Understood in such a
way, `to be an Argive' signified a connection with the Homeric epics and brought
those so designated universal respect in the Greek world as genuine Greeks. The cities
of the south coast of Asia Minor referred in this context especially to the many
versions of the narratives about the homecoming of the Greeks after the fall of
Troy. Amongst these were, for instance, the tradition of the Greek seer Kalchas,
who foresaw the shipwreck of the fleet and therefore refused to go on board ship.
He went along the coast of Asia Minor towards the south with other heroes (Scheer
1993: 153f f.). According to some versions he died in Klaros, in a competition with
another seer, Mopsos (Strabo 14.1.27 Hesiod fr. 278MW). Other sources make
Kalchas travel fur ther with his fellow seers Mopsos and Amphilochos, along with
other heroes, to Pamphylia, Cilicia and Syria (Hagias in Proklos, Davies EGF: 67;
Hdt. 7.91). According to popular mythological genealogy none of those involved,
with the exception of Amphilochos, actually came from Argos. The vagueness of the
term `Argive' allowed them all, however, to become kings of the Argives, `reges
Argivorum' (cf. Cic. Div. 1.88; Scheer 1993: 210±11).
Alexander and the Greek founding heroes of Cilicia
Why did the cities of Cilicia suddenly discover their mythical past in the Hellenistic
period? Here again the campaigns of Alexander seem to represent the deciding factor.
As the Macedonian army reached Cilicia the cities of the area experienced dif ferent
treatment. The city of Soloi unambiguously suppor ted the Persians. She was pun
ished for this: she received a garrison and had to pay an indemnity of 200 talents. On
the other hand Alexander behaved much more generously towards neighbouring
Mallos: he sacrificed there to Amphilochos (Arr. Anab. 2.5). Whether there was a
sanctuar y to Amphilochos before that time is unknown: the oldest records mention
Amphilochos rather in connection with the neighbouring city of Soloi. But for
Alexander it was obviously possible without dif ficulty to of fer the hero a public
sacrifice in Mallos. Possibly Interpretatio Graeca, the habit of recognizing Greek
The Past in a Hellenistic Present 227



mythical figures in foreign mythology, played a role here once more. Whomsoever
Alexander had identified as Amphilochos, the residents of Mallos had ever y reason
from then on to commemorate Amphilochos and did this in the form of a compli
cated foundation legend (Strabo 14.5.16). The discover y of the hero Amphilochos by
Alexander gained for the Mallians exemption from the taxes they had previously had
to pay to the Persians. According to Arrian, Alexander had expressly given as the
reason for his kindness to Mallos the argument that the Mallians were colonists from
Argos. Amphilochos, as the son of Amphiaraos, originally came from there according
to mythical genealogy. And the same passage states that Alexander had counted
himself among the Heraklids from Argos (Arr. Anab. 2.5.9). Even though Alexander,
after battles in the surrounding territor y, in the end also sacrificed to Asklepios of
Soloi and held magnificent games there, still the emphasis on the old family connec
tion and the prestige attached to it remained limited to Mallos. The historical
circumstances of the founding of Mallos must have been just as unfamiliar to the
Macedonians as those of Soloi. According to archaeological evidence Soloi, which
possibly had at one time been an emporion of Rhodian sailors, perhaps actually had a
greater right to boast of its Greek ancestr y. However it clearly did not depend on the
real past: in comparison the mythical-heroic version of the past carried much more
weight than the reality. The preferential treatment of Mallos by Alexander clearly
brought local consequences with it. Mythological ambition was now awoken also in
Soloi, which sought proof of its own mythological relationships: apparently embassies
went directly to Argos and claimed the Argive seer Amphilochos for Soloi. They were
successful, since privileges for the Solians in the Argive people's assembly are attested
by inscriptions from the end of the four th centur y onwards (Stroud 1984). And
Argos was not the only place that the Solians approached. The far-reaching echo of
the Solian claim to ancient Greekness in the Hellenistic period is also reflected in
Polybios (21.24.4): in the disputes with Rome the Rhodians gave suppor t to Soloi ±
with the argument that they were both related and both came originally from Argos.
The Solians had emphasized the connection with Rhodes through inscribed votive
offerings to the temple of Athena Lindia (FGrH 532.33).
The sudden proliferation of foundation myths that followed the Macedonian
conquest indicates how places, which had previously been peripheral, were now
tr ying to shape their conception of the world according to Greek categories. In this
attempt however they did not proceed in a purely arbitrar y manner. For one thing the
link to Homeric epic again came into play. Over and above that, the presence of
heroic seers in Cilicia cannot have been a coincidence. For centuries the ancient
Kizzuwatna of the Hittites had been a region of par ticularly sacral character, in
which purification and atonement rituals played an impor tant role (Burker t 1983;
Scheer 1993: 266f f.).
If settlements like Mallos and Soloi had gained prestige through stressing their
alleged Greekness, which was rooted in the heroic past, clearly the impor tant city of
Tarsos could not be left behind in this matter. When Xenophon went through Cilicia
in the early four th centur y on the occasion of the Anabasis, he had ± contrar y to his
usual practice ± nothing to say about Greeks resident there. Before the campaigns of
Alexander, Tarsos was apparently not recognized as a veiled Greek city. Nothing is
known about Alexander's reaction to the cults of Tarsos. In contrast to neighbouring
Soloi, there is no direct epigraphic evidence that Tarsos sent embassies to the Greek
228 Tanja S. Scheer



motherland to seek confirmation of a prestigious foundation legend. Never theless it
is clear, not just from Strabo, but also from later sources, that the Tarsians wanted to
be Argives (Dio Chr ys. 33.41). While Soloi and Mallos put the main emphasis
regarding their past on Greek seers who came from Troy, the Tarsians accentuated
their past in a dif ferent way: among other things they claimed to be descendants of
Triptolemos and the Argives who accompanied him in search of Io. If the city
possessed Argive founders, then it was also connected to Herakles and Alexander.
And at this point we come back to the questions posed at the beginning of this
chapter: what had Triptolemos to do with Argos in the mythological tradition of the
Greeks? What connected him to Io? Why do we hear now of an organized search for
the Argive woman who, according to earlier sources, was driven across the world in
the shape of a cow by a gadfly? In the classical versions of the Triptolemos myth Argos
was not even mentioned. Strabo is the earliest evidence for this. The hero Triptole
mos, who had brought the world the Eleusinian Mysteries and the ar t of agriculture,
was from earliest times an Attic national hero. The Argive claim to Triptolemos
appears first in Pausanias: even before he went to Athens, he is said to have established
mysteries in Argos (Paus. 1.14.2). The search for Io is also first verified in the
Hellenistic period. Here it seems to involve a `fur ther thinking out of the myth'
by Hellenistic scholars: the similarity in this case with another better known stor y is
only too clear ± with the search for another of Zeus' loves, Europa (Hdt. 4.147;
Davison 1991: 54; Scheer 1993: 276f f.). Just as Europa's father had sent out her
brothers at the head of a band of men with instructions to bring their sister home
again and with the condition that they were not to return home without her, so now a
group of Argives with a well-known leader went in search of the missing princess of
Argos. Whether a relationship between Triptolemos and Io was postulated does not
emerge from the sources but would not be surprising. It was also said of the
unsuccessful pursuers of Europa that they had founded cities in faraway places,
since a return home without the missing princess was denied them.
Where this version of the myth of Triptolemos and Io originated can only be
conjectured: the forced linking of Triptolemos with Argos in another context, too,
would point to the involvement of Argos itself. There are probably several reasons
why the city of Tarsos thought up such an uncanonical foundation legend: like the
neighbouring cities it sought a connection with the Argives and therefore a kinship
with Alexander. For the realization of this claim the best contenders in Greek
mythology were the migrant hero Triptolemos and Io who is said to have gone to
Egypt through Asia Minor driven by the anger of Hera: in this way the Tarsian claim
could be fitted to some extent logically into the Greek traditions.
In addition, however, the local traditions of the Cilician hinterland may have
inspired this Tarsian foundation legend: from the fifth centur y onward coins of Tarsos
already bore an ear of corn (BMC Cilicia 1900: 164 no. 11; table 28, 12). The
Cilician plain was already famous for its fer tility and for its abundance of corn under
the Assyrians and Persians. The native god Baal Tarz was, after all, represented with
ears of corn and bunches of grapes in his hands (Chuvin 1981: 314). To recognize
the Greek bringer of corn in him was natural.
But it was not only the link to Argive traditions, conferring equal status with other
Cilician cities, that Triptolemos made possible. The corn-bringer was also ver y
popular in the Seleukid hear tland of the Syrian Tetrapolis, which bordered on Cilicia
The Past in a Hellenistic Present 229



to the nor th east. Seleukos Nikator settled descendants of Triptolemos in Antioch
(Strabo 16.2.5). Much later Libanios took up the tradition: Triptolemos is supposed
to have finally settled in Antioch (Lib. 11.51±2). The city of Antioch even pointed to
the grave of Io, while Tarsos had to be satisfied with being founded by anonymous
Argive companions of Triptolemos. Even in later times they apparently did not
possess a heroon
of a prominent founder. To be connected to an impor tant royal
capital like Antioch could not do the Tarsians any harm.
Barbarian relations? The Argives on the Panhellenic stage
The ambition of Cilician cities to find a familial connection with the most famous
cities and the most ancient traditions of Greek myth, therefore, need not cause
surprise. But how was this noble ancestr y, the frequently attested aristocratic lineage
(
eugeneia
) of the proud city of Argos, compatible with cities of highly questionable
Greekness, which were suddenly knocking on the gates and wishing to be recognized
as relatives of long standing?
That the Argives wanted to make their glorious past productive in the Hellenistic
present is demonstrated by the cultivation of their relationship to the Macedonian
kings long after Alexander (Livy 32.22.11). The delegations from the fringes of the
ancient Greek world also benefited from this attitude. They were clearly by no means
turned away with disdain nor fobbed of f as discreetly as possible ± quite the contrar y.
The Argives bragged about their `ancient' connections in the Eastern Mediterranean.
This is shown for instance by an Argive decree from the end of the four th centur y
(Stroud 1984). The Argives not only granted citizen rights to the people of Aspendos,
a Pamphylian city with a not too well-established Greek past (Scheer 1993: 203f f.),
but they expressly pointed out that the Rhodians and the Cilician Solians already
enjoyed the same privileges as kin. Three copies of the inscription were set up in
prominent places: in the civic sanctuar y of Apollo L ykeios, in the Argive Heraion and
finally in the panhellenic temple precinct of Zeus of Nemea, a sign of the value that
was placed on the publicizing of these familial connections.
Kinship with cities of questionable Greekness in Pamphylia and Cilicia was, there
fore, no longer something to conceal with shame. The behaviour of Argos is par ticu
larly instructive here, as Pausanias cer tified that the Argives were filled with par ticular
pride on account of their glorious past and in this respect were in constant competi
tion with the Athenians: `among the Greeks the ones who compete most of all with
the Athenians with regard to their antiquity and the gifts which they claim to have
received from the gods are the Argives' (1.14.2).
So the changes in the Greek world picture reveal themselves not only in the
dealings of the famous old Greek cities with Hellenistic kings. The city-states of the
Greek motherland had lost political influence compared with the new territorial states
of Alexander and his Hellenistic successors. Power and wealth were no longer concen
trated in Greece itself, the centres had shifted eastwards. Pamphylia, Cilicia and Syria
along with the new Seleukid capital of Antioch were no longer peripheral areas,
inhabited by semi-barbarians, whose strange dialects were a cause of merriment.
Instead they were prosperous areas in the immediate shadow of royal power, and it
was wor thwhile even for venerable cities like Argos to be bound to them by family
ties.

The expansion of the world in the Hellenistic present resulted in a re-ordering of
the past. The tendency of the Hellenistic period towards the systematizing of a world
whose current upheavals no doubt seemed ominous to many revealed itself also in the
systematizing of the past. The traditional tales of the Greeks proved themselves once
more to of fer constructive possibilities. Myth had never been a canonical text in the
sacred sense. It was open to new combinations and new emphases: it could be logically
`thought out further'. And so the inclusion of the new structures of the present was
successful, since their roots could be discovered in the past. And the hither to
marginal regions, addressed in the language of myth, responded swiftly. As par tici
pants in myth numerous cities ± from Tarsos to Pergamon ± achieved integration in
the new political systems, which were dominated by Greeks. Their integration oc
curred on the basis of familial connections with the retention of local features. The
broadening of the mythic system of co-ordinates helped the inhabitants of cities with
an ancient Greek tradition, from Argos to Tegea, to come to terms with the Hellen
istic present ± by looking back to the mythical past.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Space and Geography
Klaus Geus
Alexander the Great in his youth had Aristotle as his tutor, a circumstance that has led
to excited speculation among scholars. What knowledge and insight might Aristotle
have imparted to his pupil? The ancient sources do not supply us with unequivocal
information, they even cast doubt on the assumption that both were on good terms.
Nevertheless it is not unreasonable to suppose that in the course of the three years
during which Aristotle tutored Alexander the subject of geography came up for
discussion. In some cases it is even possible to demonstrate that Alexander proceeded
with his campaigns on the basis of geographical conceptions which are mentioned in
the works of Aristotle (Schachermeyr 1973: 87±9). I will also tr y to argue that some
of the methods and arguments used by Alexander to assess and explain new discover
ies can be traced back to his teacher.
1 The World Before Alexander
In the generation of Aristotle a new scientific conviction became increasingly popular
among Greek scholars: that the earth was not a flat disc but a sphere. This theor y had
implications for the way in which people thought about the earth's surface. Longstand
ing questions about the distribution of water and land mass as well as the geographical
position of the continents were being asked afresh, especially by scholars belonging to
the school of Aristotle, such as Dikaiarchos and Straton (Geus 2000a: 84±6).
Aristotle believed that in comparison with other stars the earth was not large. He
noted that `the mathematicians' who tried to determine its circumference put it at
400,000 stades (Cael. 2.14, 298a); although he does not say who they were, it is
possible that Eudoxos of Knidos was one of those he had in mind. How these
`mathematicians' reached this conclusion is not known, but their method need not
have been mathematical or astronomical. It would be more than a centur y before
Eratosthenes came up with such a technique for calculating the circumference.
Presumably, they worked with information gathered from descriptions of journeys
by sea (periploi) and by land (itineraria) and then estimated any distances that were
still unknown (cf. Arist. Mete. 2.5, 362b).



Aristotle also produced a model to map the surface of the ear th. Possibly following
Parmenides, he divided the ear th into zones which extended round the globe in
broad strips. The ear th consisted of five zones, two habitable and three uninhabitable.
The Greeks lived in the zone `towards the upper pole', which was bounded by the
Arctic Circle in the nor th and the Tropic of the Cancer in the south. Another
habitable zone existed towards the south pole. This latter hypothesis was revolution
ar y, as it led inevitably to the conclusion that unknown peoples may live either in the
southern hemisphere (`antipodes') or at the rear of the nor thern zone (`perioikoi').
The old conviction that the Greeks were at the centre of the world had star ted to
break down.
After discovering that the region in which we live is only a par t of the ear th's
sur face, the Greeks needed a new term to distinguish the known par ts of the world
from the unknown par ts of the world: oikoumene, i.e. the `inhabited (ear th)'. The
earlier maps based on the out-dated flat-ear th theor y had to be changed. Around 500
Hekataios of Miletos had still drawn a circular map. Now the oikoumene was super
imposed on these circular maps in the form of a rectangle.
In the decades that followed, geographers argued about the extent of the oikou
mene and its appearance. Demokritos proposed a ratio of 3:2 for the relationship
between the oikoumene's length (from west to east) and its breadth (from nor th to
south); Eudoxos preferred 2:1; Dikaiarchos chose 3:2, and according to Eratos
thenes, who called the oikoumene `chlamys-shaped' (Zimmermann 2002), it was
`more than 2:1'. Aristotle estimated by means of periploi and itineraria that the
ratio was `more than 5:3' (Mete. 2.5, 362b). The edges of the oikoumene were
terminated by distant countries or geographical cornerstones: Lake Maeotis and
Scythia were in the nor th, India in the east, Ethiopia in the south and the Pillars of
Herakles in the west. According to the hellenocentric view the ± geographically
speaking ± central position of Greece had endowed the Greeks with the good qualities
of the nor thern and southern peoples. From this circumstance Aristotle could derive a
legitimate claim to Greek supremacy (Pol. 7.7, 1327b20±33).
Fur ther arguments were put for ward. Several scholars imagined the region around
the Pillars of Herakles as joined to India and in suppor t of their contention they
of fered the fact that elephants were to be found at the extremities of both lands, a
suggestion that Aristotle considered to be `not utterly incredible' (Cael. 2.14, 298a).
It is interesting to see here how a (rather vague) zoological obser vation could lend
credibility to a geographical hypothesis ± or rather had to, since the Greeks of that
time lacked more advanced means for determining the latitude and especially the
longitude of an obser ver. As a result, it was the standard procedure of the philoso
phers of that time, who thought all things to be interconnected, to draw upon
information from dif ferent scientific disciplines and to arrive at far-reaching conclu
sions.
This new model of the world, developed by philosophers and geographers, was also
adopted by laymen, albeit in a more primitive form. Strabo, our main source for
hellenistic geography, and the Christian monk Kosmas Indikopleustes both repor t
how the four th-centur y historian Ephoros made use of a rectangular map (Strabo
1.2.28; Cosm. Christian Topography 2: 148). In the four th book of his Histories
Ephoros sketched out the oikoumene in the form of a parallelogram (where the south
is on the upper side).

The Parallelogram of Ephoros
Ephoros equated each side and angle of the parallelogram with `compass points'
expressed in terms of winds and with astronomical points, i.e. where the sun rises and
sets on the day of the summer and winter solstice. Each side is also bounded by one of
the outlying peoples. While the Scythians are in the nor th and the Celts in the west,
the Ethiopians are situated along the south and the Indians along the east (figure
14.1). The nor thern and southern lines are said to be longer than the eastern and
western which underlines the fact that the relative horizon, marked by cer tain fixed
points, is terminated by a Greek obser ver (Heidel 1937: 16±18).
Thus, the model of Ephoros was based on the old conception that Greece, or
rather the Greeks, were located at the centre of the oikoumene. It is still influenced by
the tradition of the old Ionian circular maps. Like his predecessor Hippokrates,
Ephoros followed the principle of dividing up the edges of the oikoumene among
the main peoples according to the horizon of a Greek obser ver. Fur thermore, the
influence of the ethnological tradition on geography is clearly visible. At the centre of
this ethnological view of the ear th, that is to say in Greece, there is normalcy (order
and civilization), whereas as one moves towards the outer rim conditions grow
increasingly archaic and primeval. The Greek ethnographer had no second thoughts
about populating the peripher y of the oikoumene with fantastic peoples and creatures.
Blissful barbarians, such as the Hyperboreans, Scythians and Ethiopians, lived in
the nor th and south. Fantastic lands stretched out to the west and east: the garden
of the Hesperides and Er ytheia lay in the west, India over to the east and Amazonia to
the nor th-east (Romm 1992). The fur ther the distance from the centre, the less
accurate the information Greeks had at their disposal. Later, the Hellenistic authors of
utopian literature were to fall back on just such a model. Unlike Aristotle, whose
more abstract and more scientifically advanced theor y uses distant yet known coun
tries and geographical cornerstones as boundaries, Ephoros seems to owe much to this
ethnological model when he states that the oikoumene is bounded by cer tain peculiar
peoples. This way of thinking was not without influence on the first Greeks to visit
these lands. For example, when Alexander's Macedonians heard about armed female

warriors living in the vicinity of Chorasmia, they were quick to identify them with the
Amazons of legend (Arr. Anab. 4.15.4).
It is safe to say, therefore, that in the time of Aristotle common knowledge about
the oikoumene was by no means uniform (figure 14.2). The coasts of the Mediterra
nean Sea had been explored extensively, but until the late four th centur y when
Pytheas of Massalia ventured out into the Atlantic Ocean the Greeks would have
been unable to form an accurate picture of nor thwestern Europe. As for the nor th
east, Aristotle was better, if not always correctly, informed. He held that the border
between Europe and Asia was formed by the Black Sea, the Caucasian Isthmus and
the Caspian Sea. Unlike Hekataios of Miletos he did not consider the Caspian Sea to
be a gulf of the nor thern Ocean and instead favoured Herodotos' idea that it was an
inland sea, but he mistakenly assumed that a distinction needed to be made between
the Caspian Sea and the Hyrkanian Sea (Arist. Mete. 2.1, 354a; cf. Plut. Alex. 44, 2;
for a dif ferent view, Tarn 1948: II.5±6).
Knowledge about Eastern Asia had not improved since the era of the Achaimenid
Great Kings Darius I (522± 486) and Xerxes (486± 465). The whole Iranian plateau
region from Armenia to the Hindu Kush went by the name of `Kaukasos'. According
to Greek tradition the Indians inhabited the eastern par t of the oikoumene. Aristotle
believed the eastern Ocean to be ver y close, `within view when one has crossed the
Hindu Kush' (Mete. 1.13, 350a). His geographical and biological information about
India was derived from the notoriously unreliable account of Ktesias, the Greek
doctor who had ser ved at the cour t of Artaxerxes II (Bosworth 1993's preference
for `standard gazetteers', periodoi, such as written by Eudoxos of Knidos, fails to
convince).
Space and Geography 235



The Greeks knew even less about the south-east of the oikoumene. The fifth
centur y geographer, Damastes of Sigeion, for example, had described the Arabian
Gulf as an inland lake (FGrH 5 F8 Strabo 1.3.1). Some Greeks, therefore, gathered
vaguely that the Arabian Gulf and the Persian Gulf were joined in the south and called
these two seas by a single name, the `Er ythrean Sea'. It was, however, subject to
debate whether this southern `Okeanos' was an inland sea bounded by a land bridge
that connected Africa with India or was actually par t of the `Okeanos' which sur
rounded the western, southern, eastern and maybe even the nor thern (disputed by
Herodotos) outskir ts of the oikoumene. Aristotle tried to reconcile both assumptions
and maintained `that the Er ythrean Sea communicates with the Ocean outside the
straits by only a narrow channel' (Mete. 2.1, 354a; for an alternative view, Scylax 112
GGM I.95; cf. H. Berger 1903: 316±17, n. 3). In consequence Aristotle pictured
the Er ythrean Sea as a relatively small inland sea.
Information about Libya (Africa) had been lost since Pharaonic and Persian times.
During the reign of Pharaoh Necho II (610±594) Phoenician seamen had already
sailed around Africa (Hdt. 4.42.2±4), but their account was doubted in Hellenistic
times (Poseidonios in Strabo 2.2.4; cf. Polyb. 3.38.1±3) despite the fact that there
had been other enterprises of that kind, such as those by Hanno, Sataspes and Magos.
The narrative of Skylax of Kar yanda, who sailed from the Upper Indus to Suez in the
time of Darius I, was also met with disbelief (HÈ o gemann 1985: 65, n. 19). Ephoros'
discussion of the location of Kerne, an island of f the Atlantic coast of Africa, may
ser ve as an example to illustrate how knowledge about southern Africa had declined
in the period shor tly before Alexander: `Ephoros states that vessels approaching
Kerne from the Red Sea (Er ythrean Sea) are unable to advance beyond the Columns
± that being the name of cer tain islands ± because of the heat' (Pliny HN 6.199).
Thus, Ephoros argued that the hot zone above the equator prevented mariners from
sailing to the southern par ts of Africa and around to its Atlantic coast. Obviously he
had in mind the Aristotelian model of the five zones in which the zone between the
tropics was considered uninhabitable owing to the heat. In this way theor y domin
ated and ousted first-hand knowledge.
This, then, was the kind of information Alexander would have had at his disposal
when he hurled his spear onto Asian soil at the Hellespont in May of 334. Insights
into the outlying regions of the oikoumene had been lost, and Alexander's knowledge
of Asia would have been especially deficient. As r uling Asia appears to have been
Alexander's goal from the ver y star t, he must have imagined Asia to be substantially
smaller than it actually was. We must ask, therefore, to what extent the Greek image
of the world was changed by Alexander's campaigns.
2 Alexander's Campaigns
The first stage of Alexander's campaign up until the capture of the Persian capitals of
Babylon, Susa and Persepolis did not pose any major geographical problems. The
Greeks had long been familiar with the expanse of land that lay between the west
coast of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. Alexander could even fall back on an account
in Xenophon's Anabasis, when in the spring of 333 he marched his troops from the
ancient Phr ygian capital city of Gordion in Cilicia across the Tauros, a vast mountain
range between the Mediterranean Sea and the Anatolian mainland. The route to
236 Klaus Geus



Egypt along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea was also well-known. Once Alexander
had reached Egypt, the myster y of the Nile is said to have prompted him to send out a
scientific expedition in search of its source (Lucan 10.272±5; cf. Phot. Bibl. cod.
2489: 441b).
However, after Alexander had captured the Persian capitals and had begun his
pursuit of the Great King Darius and later Bessos into the east, he was moving into
unfamiliar territor y. Although he had been declared `king of Asia' on the battlefield of
Gaugamela in 331, his knowledge of the eastern par t of his realm, the so-called
`Upper Satrapies', was vague at best. Star ting with Ekbatana, the ancient capital of
Media, the east was terra incognita to the Greeks. This marked a turning-point. The
campaign of retaliation had now reached its conclusion and what followed was in
par t at least a voyage of exploration. The change in the character of the campaign
is evident in Alexander's treatment of his Greek allies; of ficially dismissed, they
are allowed to continue as mercenaries. Alexander thus not only conquered the
eastern regions, he also explored them. For that purpose he had at his disposal a
group of specialists called `bematists', whose duty it was to measure and calculate
distances covered by the main body of the army as well as by special detachments.
In addition to this they also recorded their obser vations on the native population,
flora, fauna and other matters of interest in the territor y through which they passed
(Bretzl 1903: 3; Ber ve 1926: I.51). Alexander himself scrutinized `the description
of the whole countr y prepared for him by those best acquainted with it' (Strabo
2.1.6).
Giving chase to Darius, Alexander crossed the Elburz Range and reached the south
coast of the Caspian Sea in 330. Whether this was an inland sea or rather a bay or a
gulf belonging to the nor thern Ocean was a problem that had for a long
time perplexed geographers, but for Alexander it was no mere academic question.
If the Caspian Sea gave easy access to the Ocean, then possession of this coast would
prove invaluable for future militar y campaigns. For the first time Alexander had to
face the possibility that he had finally reached the Ocean, the end of the world. After
some investigation, however, he concluded that the Caspian Sea was an inland sea
which was `not smaller than the Euxine' and stretched almost all the way to Lake
Maeotis (Sea of Azov), or was a stagnant overflow from Lake Maeotis (Plut. Alex.
44.1±2; Cur t. 6.4.18±19; Alexander also corrected the error of Aristotle, who had
assumed that the Caspian Sea consisted of two distinct bodies of water). The Mace
donian king based his conclusions on two obser vations: firstly, the water of the
Caspian Sea was less salty than that of other seas, and, secondly, that it produced
large serpents (Polykleitos in Strabo 11.7.4; cf. Diod. 17.75.3; Cur t. 6.4.18). The
fact that geographical conclusions were based on this sor t of obser vation is reminis
cent of a way of thinking found also in the works of Aristotle, who stated that the
distance between Eastern India and the Pillars of Herakles was relatively small because
there were elephants at the extremities of both lands.
The political situation forced Alexander to postpone his plans to explore the
Caspian Sea (Arr. Anab. 7.16.1±2). To pursue the murderers of Darius Alexander
had to invade the lands east of the Caspian Sea. Approaching from the south,
he marched his army across the Hindu Kush into Baktria in the spring of 329.
Aristotle had thought that the Hindu Kush (called by himself Parnassos, by others
Paropamisos) was the extension of the Tauros mountains in Asia Minor and that it
Space and Geography 237



reached as far as the Ocean, thus forming the eastern end of the oikoumene (Mete.
1.13, 350a). Alexander's latest militar y expedition ef fectively disproved this, at the
same time reviving but not resolving the question of the eastern Ocean. All, however,
need have not been strictly scientific. Something of the character of this newly
acquired geographical knowledge is suggested by the Macedonian belief that here
in this legendar y mountain range they had found the cave of Prometheus (Arr.Anab.
5.3.2; Ind. 5.11).
While he was still pursuing Bessos, Alexander happened upon the Amu-Dar ya river;
Ktesias and Aristotle had called this the Araxes river, but Alexander found out that it
was actually named the Oxus. A rather confused Aristotle had also believed that the
river Tanais, which flowed into the Sea of Azov and is today known as the Don, was a
tributar y of this Araxes river. It is safe to assume that it was this that led Alexander to
believe the Tanais river was in the immediate vicinity. So, when he arrived at a second
river, called Jaxar tes by the natives, he was convinced that he had reached the upper
course of the Tanais. In truth, Alexander had discovered the Syr-Dar ya river. Again,
this misinterpretation was nur tured by botanical obser vation; for the countr y on the
far side of the river was said to produce fir-trees, and since the Tanais was the
traditional boundar y between Europe and Asia and since such trees were believed
to grow only in Europe and not in Asia, it was not dif ficult to imagine that this must
indeed be the Tanais (Strabo 11.7.4; cf. Bretzl 1903: 220±6, 345±7). Accordingly,
the far side of the river Jaxar tes must be Europe again. Alexander, therefore, named
the city which he founded on the Asian bank of the river Alexandria Eschate, the
`fur thest Alexandria'. By the same reasoning, he named the nomads living across
the Jaxar tes `European Scythians', and the nomads roaming the lands on his side of
the river he called `Asian Scythians'. The earlier idea that the Caspian Sea was an
inland sea was now considered to be an established fact, as the Tanais could only circle
it to the nor th. Clearly, Alexander had not received information concerning the Aral
Sea, into which these two rivers, the Amu-Dar ya and the Syr-Dar ya, flowed (for a
dif ferent view, Tarn 1948: II.5±13). As a result of these geographical errors Alexander
would have for the first time been persuaded that he had reached the boundar y of his
Asian realm.
Ambassadors and prisoners confirmed the assumption of both Herodotos and
Aristotle that there were extensive steppes nor th of the Caspian Sea. Earlier, Ionian
geographers had believed this region of the oikoumene to be surrounded by the
Ocean. However, since these tracts of land were regarded as par ts of Europe proper,
they did not figure significantly in Alexander's plans at the time. When Pharasmenes,
the ruler of Chorasmia, invited Alexander to assist him in a campaign against the
neighbouring Kolchians and Amazons, Alexander refused, a stance indicative of his
more ambitious plans to conquer `all of Asia'. As far as Alexander was concerned, `all
of Asia' meant especially India. Although he was to be embroiled in severe fighting in
Baktria and Sogdiana for the next two years, he was already preparing an invasion of
India along the valley of the Kabul river. One of his aims was to find the Indus, which
was then considered to be the largest river in Asia, the Ganges not yet having been
discovered.
The rather fabulous ideas about India enter tained by Greeks at that time were
mainly based on the writings of Skylax, Hekataios, Herodotos and Ktesias. Above all,
it was Ktesias who had moulded the Greek sense of far eastern geography. He
238 Klaus Geus



believed the sea near India to be no larger than the Aegean and it was probably he
who was responsible for Aristotle's claim that on crossing the Hindu Kush one could
see the Ocean (Mete. 1.13, 350a).
The general direction of the expedition shows that Alexander corrected the long
standing error made by Hekataios and Herodotos, both of whom thought that the
Indus flowed eastwards and into the Ocean. They had confused the Indus with the
Kabul river, and even Aristotle still placed the origin of the Indus in the Hindu Kush.
Alexander, however, recognized the dif ference between the Kabul river and the
Indus, calling the former Kophen. It remains uncer tain whether this distinction was
based on what he learned from the native population or rather on an earlier source of
geographical information, such as Skylax.
After encountering fierce opposition, Alexander finally reached the Indus. When
the Macedonians spotted crocodiles living in the region, they were immediately
reminded of the Nile, which was also infested with crocodiles (Arr. Anab. 6.1.1).
This gave renewed credibility to the old theor y that the Nile and the Indus were
connected (Arist. frag. 248 Rose; cf. Aesch. Supp. 284±6; [Aesch.] PV 807±15). In
the course of the following weeks, this idea was suppor ted by the repeated discover y
of crocodiles in the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum), the next river that he came across.
Fur thermore, along the third river, the Akesines (modern Chenab), they discovered
sacred lotus growing, a plant known to the Greeks as the `Egyptian bean'. The
thinking is well expressed by Arrian:
Alexander had already seen crocodiles on the Indus, as on no other river except the Nile,
and beans growing on the banks of the Akesines of the same sor t as the land of Egypt
produces and, having heard that the Akesines runs into the Indus, he thought he had
found the origin of the Nile; his idea was the Nile rose somewhere thereabouts in India,
flowed through a great expanse of deser t, and there lost the name of Indus, and then,
where it began to flow through inhabited countr y, got the name of Nile from the
Ethiopians in those par ts and the Egyptians . . . (Anab. 6.1.2±3; cf. Strabo 15.1.25;
Arr. Ind. 6.8, adapted from E. Iliffe Robson)
Arrian and Strabo both say that it was Alexander himself who had made this discover y.
Obviously, they, or rather their common source Nearchos, thought that Alexander
personally drew the conclusion, and they may be right in that respect. For the third
time we are told that a key problem in geography was solved by means of biological
obser vation.
At this time Alexander believed that he was near the source of the river Nile. One
might note that this par ticular view was also held by the Persians. Twenty years before
Alexander's campaign Artaxerxes III had been planning to hold at bay the rebellious
Egyptians by diver ting the upper course of the Nile, here equated with the Indus
([Arist.] De inundatione Nili, F248 Rose: 193). Alexander may well have picked up
the idea from the Persians in his entourage. Implicit in this odd geographical notion is
a way of thinking about the world which sees the south as the mirror image of the
nor th: just as the River Tanais, which was said to originate from a sizeable lake in
the `Kaukasos' mountains, circles the Caspian Sea to the nor th and finally flows
into the Sea of Azov, that is to say the nor thern extension of the Mediterranean, so
the Indus, likewise originating from the `Kaukasos', circles the Er ythrean Sea to the
Space and Geography 239



south and eventually empties its lower course, i.e. the Nile, into the Mediterranean
(cf. figure 14.2). As a result of this geographical hypothesis, which was heavily influ
enced by the old Ionian mindset of symmetr y already criticized by Herodotos a
centur y earlier (4.36), Alexander pictured the Er ythrean Sea as a (relatively) small
inland sea and so was bound to seriously underestimate the dimensions of the
southeastern (as well as the northern) oikoumene. For the people living at the time
the world, rather strangely, appeared to be shrinking.
Without a doubt these ideas exerted a significant influence on Alexander's subse
quent plans. We have credible evidence that after the victor y over Poros near the
Hydaspes river Alexander instructed his admiral Nearchos to construct a great fleet in
order to sail back to Alexandria via the Nile, from its source to its estuar y (Strabo
15.1.25; cf. Diod. 17.89.4±5; Cur t. 9.1.3±4). Assenting to the views of Aristotle and
thus believing himself to be near the eastern end of the oikoumene, he crossed the
Hydraotes and proceeded to the Hyphasis river (modern Beas) before the construc
tion of the fleet was complete. During his advance east, however, Alexander learnt
from the Indian rulers Phegeus and Poros that the far bank of the Hyphasis was in fact
not the eastern end of the oikoumene. On the contrar y, he would find a vast expanse of
deser t which would take twelve days to cross and then he would be faced with another
large river; according to later geographers and historians this was the Ganges but this
claim must remain unproved (Boswor th 1996: 186±200). When Alexander was
fur thermore informed by the natives that the Hydaspes and Akesines rivers were
tributaries of the Indus, whose twin estuaries emptied into the `Great Sea', he was
forced to modify his conception of world geography accordingly, as the Indus could
no longer feasibly be held to be the upper course of the Nile. He, therefore, cancelled
the par t of his letter to his mother Olympias where he contended that he had
discovered the source of the Nile (Arr. Anab. 6.1.4; cf. Strabo 15.1.25). The eastern
end of the oikoumene seemed more remote than ever before. It is hardly surprising
that this news caused distress among Alexander's soldiers; with no end in sight to the
current campaign, they simply refused to go any fur ther east.
Thus, Alexander was compelled to re-think his goals. If the eastern end of the
oikoumene was unattainable, then maybe he could at least reach the southern limits?
He marched his army back to the Hydaspes, where in the meantime the construction
of the fleet had been completed. They travelled downstream beyond the Hydaspes
and Akesines rivers and arrived at the delta of the Indus in July 326. Reaching the
estuar y of the Indus provided confirmation of the belief that the Indus and the Nile
were actually two distinct rivers. In consequence, there could be no land bridge
connecting India and eastern Africa. In addition to the previously unknown phenom
enon of a tidal sea, the sighting of whales lent further suppor t to the belief that
Alexander had indeed reached the southern Ocean (Arr. Ind. 30.1). In this respect
the ancient Ionian view of the world was corroborated, as was the symmetrical
mindset inherent in it, which conceived of geographical conditions as mirrored across
the oikoumene: for whales were also regarded as typical of the western Ocean beyond
the Pillars of Herakles (cf. Plut. Mor. 22e; [Scymn.] 161±2 (GGM I.201); Avien. Or.
102, 127, 410). It is to be noted that for the fourth time during Alexander's
campaigns zoological information is used to resolve geographical issues, which is
hardly surprising at a time when the individual sciences had not yet separated from
philosophy but were still considered to be par ts of the latter.

But if, as the Ionian philosophers had believed, all of the oikoumene was sur
rounded by the Ocean, it was entirely possible to reach ever y point along the fringes
of the oikoumene by sea. It does not seem at all far-fetched to imagine that this insight
made a strong impression on Alexander, whose plans for future campaigns suggest
that his earlier land-based approach came to be superseded by a more maritime way of
thinking (H È ogemann 1985: 61±72). Subsequent expeditions, as well as the so-called
`last plans', were mainly maritime by nature. Since Alexander thought that the
Er ythrean Sea and Persian Gulf were identical, his next task was to explore the
coastline between the delta of the Indus and the estuar y of the Euphrates and Tigris,
something that had already be done by the Karian Skylax in the time of Darius.
Alexander instr ucted Nearchos to sail along the Indian coast as far as the Persian Gulf,
while he himself marched his ar my back across the Gedrosian Deser t. Nearchos'
expedition was a success. The infor mation gathered on his voyage from the delta of
the Indus river to the mouth of the Tigris provided conclusive evidence that it was
possible to travel from Babylon to India by ship.
The success of Nearchos inspired Alexander to devise fur ther projects based on the
assumption that the oikoumene was surrounded by a continuous Ocean. As geograph
ical knowledge changed and developed, so long-standing and more recent theories
were called into question: Was the Caspian Sea really an inland sea, as Alexander had
sur mised in 330? Was it tr ue that the Jaxar tes river was identical to the Tanais/Don?
To answer these questions Alexander sent a man called Herakleides, son of Argaios, to
Hyrkania with orders to build a fleet and explore the Caspian Sea (Ar r.Anab. 7.16.1;
cf. Pfist er 1961: 43± 4).
The next scheme was to trace the sea route to the south-west. Alexander, believing
the Red Sea to be a gulf of the souther n Ocean, was now planning to circumnavigate
the Arabian Peninsula with a view to opening up a direct sea route from Babylon to
Alexandria. For this project Alexander ordered the constr uction of an enor mous fleet,
which required timber to be transp or ted overland to Babylon from as far away as
Phoenicia. The venture, however, was brought to a halt by Alexander's premature
death in June 323. The royal archives contained outlines of projects far more ambi
tious than this Arabian expedition. Although the authenticity of these plans has been
the subject of much controversy, there is no valid reason to reject them outright.
Their sheer audacity is consistent with Alexander's character, as is their far-reaching
geographical scope. Above all, the change to a more maritime outlook is clearly
evident, as the coasts of the oikoumene defined these plans.
In addition to the Arabian fleet that was being constr ucted in Babylon, a second
fleet was to be built on the coast of Phoenicia and Syria, which was intended to travel
westwards along the African coast of the Mediter ranean until it reached the Pillars of
Herakles. Similarly, the plan to circumnavigate Africa, conceived by Alexander in 324
should be taken seriously (Plut. Alex. 68, 1; Arr. Anab. 5.26.2; 7.1.2±3; Boswor th
1988: 185±97); less probable, however, are the repor ts that he planned to search for
the source of the Nile and to visit Ethiopia (Cur t. 4.8.3; L yd. Mens. 4.197;
cf. Desanges 1978: 246±7). When one looks at modern maps, scepticism about
Alexander's plans for exploration is so much easier, but Alexander himself would
have had no clear notion of the southward extension of Africa, and in all probability
grossly underestimated the size of Arabia and Libya. His conception of Asia in one
sense demanded a sur vey of the nor th African coast; he believed that `only after the
Space and Geography 241



conquest of Libya and Car thage could he rightfully be called king over all of Asia'
(Arr. Anab. 7.1.2). This statement is firmly rooted in ancient Ionian tradition, which
held Libya to be par t of Asia; only later did it rise to the rank of an independent
continent (Zimmermann 1999: 36±54).
Alexander's geographical outlook was fully in keeping with his times. His approach
reveals the influence not only of Aristotle but also of the Ionian tradition; the latter,
with its emphasis on symmetr y, applied the conditions of a known region of the
oikoumene to an unknown region as though it were its mirror image. Similarly the way
Alexander dealt with scientific information was also typical of the period.
As it became increasingly dif ficult to obtain reliable geographical information
during the second half of his campaign, Alexander began to draw geographical
conclusions from obser vations of a biological nature. We have seen how interpret
ations were based on the presence or absence of such things as serpents, fir-trees,
crocodiles, beans and whales. The questionable nature of such thinking did not
escape notice in antiquity; Arrian criticized Alexander for `drawing conclusions
about impor tant things from ver y slender indications' (Arr. Anab. 6.1.4). Such a
method can be called inductive or phenomenological: a set or system of r ules is
derived from or even proved by a single obser vation. In the case of Alexander, it is
especially striking that the information submitted to him was discussed on the spot
and apparently assessed by himself (and not by competent specialists and scientists ±
there were none at that time). It is tempting to see here the influence of Aristotle who
had been conducting research in the field of biology shor tly before and during his
time as Alexander's tutor (Du È ring 1966: 510, 523). Indeed a much-quoted passage
of the Elder Pliny tells how Alexander had assisted Aristotle in the collection of
zoological data (HN 8.16.44). Alexander, of course, was doing something ver y
dif ferent from Aristotle; there was no concer n with biological theor y, but in his
treatment of empirical data and in the often far-reaching conclusions he drew from
it an Aristotelian influence can be detected.
3 The World after Alexander
Alexander's campaigns brought with them a wealth of new, albeit unconfirmed ±
geographical, ethnological, anthropological, zoological, botanical, sociological, pol
itical, historical and economic ± information about the inhabited world, causing a
surge of interest in geography. Numerous travel accounts, written in early Hellenistic
times, such as those of Nearchos, Pytheas and Megasthenes, bear witness to this
growing interest. Fur thermore the regions untouched by Alexander's campaigns
attracted attention. If information could not be obtained, it was often invented.
Both Strabo and Arrian claim that the Macedonians deliberately falsified geographical
data in order to promote the glor y of Alexander (Strabo 11.7.4, Arr.Anab. 5.3.2±3;
Ind. 5, 10). Above all, there grew up a sizeable body of utopian literature: the
writings of such as Hekataios of Abdera, Euhemeros and Iamboulos, and the legends
about the fantastic voyages of Alexander. The fictitious travelogues and ethnographic
accounts about peoples living at the edges of the world so characteristic of this
literature encouraged people to disbelieve even tr ustwor thy narratives like that of
Pytheas on Thule. These fanciful tales, sometimes treated as reliable sources by the
later writers such as Strabo and Diodoros, shattered traditional geographical and
242 Klaus Geus



ethnographic conceptions no less than authentic accounts of expeditions and for a
long time would exer t considerable influence over Greek ideas about the fringes of
the world (cf. Geus 2000b). The centrifugal forces released by the enlargement of the
oikoumene catapulted Greece of f its central position. The ancient Ionian circular maps
had become obsolete by the era of Alexander. But the time was not yet ripe for a new
model of the world, not even as succeeding generations of the Greeks acquired new
information about Taprobane (modern Sri Lanka), the Ganges, north-eastern
Europe, the Caspian Sea and Arabia.
Since the individual sciences were considered par ts of philosophy, all this new
information about the world was classified according to the leading philosophical
systems. Four great schools of thought had emerged at the beginning of the third
centur y B C : the Academy, the Peripatos, the Stoa and Epicureanism. By the middle of
the centur y the founders and the first generation of pupils were dead, and their
successors were wearing themselves out in petty quarrels and polemics. The masters'
theories became dogmatic. New information was not supposed to question old
convictions or to arrive at new conclusions, but to corroborate existing dogmas.
Despite assiduously gathering information, the Aristotelians integrated it into the
system founded by Aristotle without analysing it for some greater goal. They were
content with the idle collection of data. The Academy, the Stoa, and the Epicureans
were also conser vative in terms of scientific thought; there were even setbacks, such as
Epicurus' theor y of motion which caused him to discard the idea of a spherical ear th.
It is hardly surprising that when scientific progress was made, it was done by individ
uals who did not belong to any par ticular philosophical school or at least by philoso
phers who had managed to break free from constraints imposed by their school. The
individual sciences received fresh impetus in the time after Alexander. Geography was
pressed for ward in par ticular by Eratosthenes, Hipparchos and Ptolemaios.
Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276±194) secured his place in the histor y of scientific
thought with his calculation of the circumference of the ear th, based not on conjec
ture but on mathematics and astronomy (Geus 2002: 223±38). He also drew a new
map of the oikoumene, one which was a major improvement on the older maps with
their characteristic features of analogy, symmetr y and speculation. Eratosthenes seems
to have renounced this old method, which had been used by Alexander; turning
against those who tried to base geographical boundaries on botanical obser vation, he,
rather sarcastically, pointed out that the fir-tree also grew in India (Strabo 11.7.4). He
was also the first geographer to draw parallel circles and meridians and develop them
into a proper system. By means of known distances and the localization of central
points within his system of co-ordinates it was now possible for him to construct a
new map of the oikoumene. Despite certain conceptual imper fections his theories put
the study of geography on a new scientific basis. The cornerstones of his map
consisted no longer of peoples (`the Indians', `the Celts' etc.), but of cities (Meroe,
Thule, Tamaros etc.) and significant geographical points (Cape Notu Keras etc.).
Eratosthenes' geographical construct was not only more accurate than that of his
predecessors, but was also devoid of ethnological implications and connotations. It
was, however, only the first step towards a more scientific approach. Eratosthenes was
unable to determine more than a handful of parallel circles (and even less meridians)
running through some of the most impor tant cities of early Hellenistic times
(Alexandria, Rhodes, Byzantion, Carthage, Massalia, Cadiz). Thus, since these cities
Space and Geography 243



were chosen in par t because of their political status, they formed no completely
abstract and geometrical set of co-ordinates (Prontera 1997). So, themodus operandi
of Eratosthenes must not be judged as a complete break with geographical tradition.
The Cyrenean geographer trod both old and new paths. On the one hand, he
appreciated the need to determine the relevant locations on the basis of astronomical
obser vations, on the other hand there was not enough data available to allow him to
ignore all the empirical information he had at hand. HisGeographika were dictated by
insight and restraint. From that point of view Eratosthenes' geographical achieve
ments may be considered to be an expedient compromise between the claims of
theor y and practical feasibility (Geus 2000a: 92; 2002: 288).
Later astronomers and geographers criticized Eratosthenes for his extensive use of
itineraries and periploi to determine the positions of the meridians and parallel circles.
Hipparchos of Nikaia, working in the latter half of the second centur y BC
, is said to
have demanded that the relative positions of places be determined solely by astro
nomical obser vations (Strabo 1.1.12). Nonetheless, he was too far ahead of his time
in stating the principle to be able to follow it in practice, since his access to astronom
ical data was limited to only a small number of places. He did not think the system of
Erastosthenes could be modified. In consequence, Hipparchos preferred to use the
old Ionian maps, even though they were less accurate (Strabo 2.1.38; cf. H. Berger
1903: 109; Prontera 1997). Hellenistic geography, therefore, reached an impasse at
the point where Eratosthenes left it and may even have slipped back again.
Eventually, it was Klaudios Ptolemaios ( AD
100±180) who renewed the scientific
foundation of geography by separating it into a theoretical and a descriptive subdisci
pline. By eliminating all political, historical and sociological aspects and by concen
trating purely on car tographic data, he elevated car tography to new heights. The
major par t of his Geography consists of a catalogue of no less than 6700 co-ordinates,
based on latitude and longitude. The geographical work of Ptolemaios is an impres
sive demonstration of applied mathematics, i.e. on the one side, it is ver y accurate, but
it also lacks vividness and colour (at least to the layman).
If we compare the ways the Greeks saw the oikoumene before and after Alexander,
we can discern a tendency towards a more objective and scientific and less ethno
logical and hellenocentric view. Just as geography became fully emancipated as an
individual science with its own methods (and not borrowing them from other
sciences or deriving them from philosophical precepts) in the time after Alexander,
so the way was paved for a new view of the world.
FURTHER READING
The fragmented character of the sources on Hellenistic geography (a useful source
book is Kish 1978) is mirrored by the modern scholarly literature. A comprehensive
English account is still a desideratum. The (par tly outdated) standard works by
Bunbur y 1879, H. Berger 1903, Warmington 1934, Thomson 1948, Tozer 1964,

point. Dilke 1985 is a modern classic, but concentrates exclusively on car tography.
The question whether and to what extent maps were actually used in antiquity has
caused great controversy: Janni 1984 and Brodersen 1995 deny that maps were
common outside the scientific community; for some par ticular aspects see Heidel
1937 and Aujac 1987.
The Hellenistic period brought about the distinction between descriptive, theoret
ical and didactic geography, thus making it dif ficult to illuminate more general aspects
and developments. In consequence, more recent publications have focused on single
geographers, especially on our most impor tant source, Strabo of Amaseia: K. Clarke
1999 (who also covers Polybios and Poseidonios), J. Engels 1999, Dueck 2000; on

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Town and Country in
Ptolemaic Egypt

1 Introduction
Even to Thebes
in Egypt, where vast treasures lie piled in the houses
And there are a hundred gates, through each of which two hundred men
Surge for th with their horses and chariots. (Homer, Iliad 9.381±4)
If western scholars have often tended to treat the Greek polis as the consummate
urban form, superior to the cities which developed ver y much earlier elsewhere in the
Near East, the Greeks themselves were suf ficiently impressed by the urban glories of
Egypt, already over two thousand years old when Alexander the Great founded his
city of Alexandria on the Egyptian coast in spring 331 B C .
The annual inundation of the Nile valley and Delta created the fer tile conditions to
suppor t a relatively high population, while discouraging dispersed settlement. Com
munities clung to the sides of the valley above flood level or perched on mounds
which rose ever higher with the accumulation of waste, at flood time resembling
islands in the sea (Hdt. 2.97.1). Even if a centralized state was not exactly a pre
requisite for the successful exploitation of the Nile's hydrology, and agriculture could
be organized at a local level using `natural' irrigation basins (Butzer 1976: 106±11),
the desire to improve upon nature by the control of water, and the construction of
canals to distribute it most ef fectively, undoubtedly encouraged the growth of a
strong state and homogeneous administrative system based on the division of the
whole countr y into 36 districts (nomes in Greek; the number later rose to over 40)
each with a principal town as well as numerous villages. Despite the ease of communi
cation by water (boats travelling south benefited from the prevailing wind; the
current assisted those going nor th), tension between central control and local par
ticularism was a constant feature of Egyptian histor y, and the union of `The Two
Lands' remained precarious as the centre of royal power shifted between Upper
(south) and Lower Egypt (for map of Egypt, figure 7.1).



In the course of over two millen nia, dif ferent phar aohs bestowe d their patronage
on many dif ferent cities, includ ing Heli opolis (near moder n Cairo) , and Tanis and
Sais in the Del ta. But the two citi es to develop the most enduri ng impor tance were
Thebes and Memphis, with their vast and hugely we althy temple complex es.
Althoug h the re were, of course, significant dif ferenc es between the str uctu re and
layout of Egypt ian cities and Greek poleis (cf. Alston 1997), we must beware of ethno
centric prejudic e when interpr eting the sign ificance of the grid plan d esign of the new
Ptolema ic foundat ions in Egypt (section 3 below). Egypt ian town planners we re also
capable of adopti ng a rectiline ar design, par ticularly d uring the Midd le Kingdom
(Kemp 1989: 14 9±66); and the main cont rast is betwe en planned commun ities, often
constr ucte d under royal patronag e, and those whi ch dev eloped more orga nically ove r
the long te r m. It is tr ue, howeve r, that in the New King dom, Egyptian pla nners made
little attem pt to extend the rectiline ar patt er n into areas of privat e housing (most
conspicuous at Akhena ten's shor t-lived foundation at A mar na; Kem p 1989: 294).
On the edge of the deser t just beyond the limit of cultivation were site d the burial
places for the valley towns. T hese necrop oleis themselv es dev eloped resident popul a
tions of embalm ers and priests to ser ve the mor tuar y cults; at Memphis the se vir tually
constitut ed an alter nati ve city on the deser t escarpm ent ove rlooking the vall ey city
(D. J. T hompson 1988: 10). On the wes t bank of the Nile at Thebes we re several
commun ities which grew from the need for worke rs to build and ser vice ro yal tombs
and mor tuar y te mples; the town of Djeme in the sh adow o f the te mple of Ramese s III
at Medine t Habu has yielded document ation of ever yday life right throug h un til af ter
the A rab con quest. In the New Kingdom, worke rs on the royal tombs in the V alle y of
the Kings were segreg ated in a spe cially constr ucte d village at Dei r el Me dina, where
thorou gh exca vation has reveale d detaile d archaeo logical evidenc e of dom estic hous
ing as well as docum ents relat ing to the bus iness dealing s and privat e lives of the
workers which af fo rds compari son with the Ptole maic evidenc e discussed in this
chapter (McD owell 1999; Me skell 2002: 38±44) .
Thus, whe n Alexand er the Gre at ar rived to libe rate Egypt from Pers ian r ule in
autumn 332
BC
, Egypt already posse ssed a long urban tradi tion, embracing the
two maj or cities of Memphis and Thebes , some for ty fu r ther nom e capital s, and
thousa nds of smaller towns and villages. Diodo ros' claim of `more than thric e
ten thou sand' at the time of Ptole my I is far too high and sounds sus piciously
convent ional, thou gh the manu script may anyway be co r r upt (1.31 .7, cf. T heocr .
Id. 17.82±4; Rathbone 1990: 104). Lat er there were about 120 villages in the
Oxyrh ynchite nom e, which is probably not untyp ical.
Also by the time of Alexande r's conque st, Egypt includ ed several residen t commu
nities of Greeks. Herodo tos te lls how the sevent h-centur y pharaoh Psamm etichos
provide d his Ionia n and Karian me rcenaries with two settleme nts calle d the `Ca mps'
in the Nile Del ta near Buba stis; in the nex t cent ur y , pha raoh A masis moved the m to
cosmo politan Me mphis (2.154; D. J. Thom pson 1988: 84). Psammet ichos, too, was
responsible for the Milesian emporion of Naukratis in the wester n Delta, which
Amasi s made the bas e for all Gre eks who traded with Egypt , both per mane nt and
temporar y res idents (Strabo 17.1.18; Hdt. 2.178). Thus local Gre eks, as we ll as
ambas sadors and Alexande r's own troops, will have appreciat ed the game s he held
at Me mphis during the win ter; an d on his dep ar ture in sprin g 331, the noto rious
Kleomen es of Naukr atis was able to seize sole cont rol of the countr y , r uining
250 Jane Rowlandson



Alexander's attempt to leave a government which balanced the power of dif ferent
interest groups (Arr. Anab. 3.1.5).
Alexander's most famous city foundation, Alexandria on the Egyptian coast, must
have anticipated from the star t a significant further influx of Greeks into Egypt; but it
was left to his general Ptolemy, who obtained control of Egypt after Alexander's
death (Thompson, this volume, section 1), to carr y out the policy of attracting large
numbers of immigrants. Although we cannot document the process by which the
citizen body of Alexandria was first constituted, and the rapid growth of its popula
tion to include non-citizen Greeks, Egyptians, Jews and other Semitic peoples, as well
as other groups, within a generation or so it had clearly over taken Athens as the
largest, and wealthiest, city of the Greek world (Fraser 1972: vol. I chapter 2).
But Greek immigration was by no means confined to Alexandria. Ptolemy decided
to found only one further Greek polis in Egypt, Ptolemais, clearly intended to provide
a focus for the new regime in the south, as Alexandria was in the nor th. Instead he
chose to cement the loyalty of his mercenaries by granting them allotments (kleroi)
throughout the countr yside, mostly in existing communities where Egyptians lived
side by side with the new settlers. This had profound implications for the future
course of Egypt's social and cultural development (Diod. 19.85.4, 20.47.4; Uebel
1968; Bagnall 1984). The for tuitous sur vival of tens of thousands of papyrus docu
ments, in Greek and Egyptian, enables us to look in detail at some of these commu
nities, and the process by which the immigrants settled on the land and were
progressively assimilated with the existing population. The dr y conditions suited to
the preser vation of papyrus, however, are found only in cer tain par ts of Egypt,
par ticularly the cemeteries along the fringes of the Nile valley and around the
peripher y of the Fayum, the `semi-oasis' to the south-west of Memphis which was
subject to much development and settlement under the early Ptolemies (Thompson,
this volume, section 2). Thus our information is ver y patchy; and ironically we know
much more about some obscure villages (such as Kerkeosiris; section 4 below) than
about the Greek cities of Naukratis and Ptolemais, which are both ver y scantily
documented in the papyri. Even Alexandria has produced no papyri directly ± because
of the high water table throughout the Delta ± although it is attested in various ways
by numerous papyri from other par ts of Egypt, as well as in much other literar y,
documentar y and archaeological evidence.
This review of town and countr y in Ptolemaic Egypt will star t with a look at these
three `true' Greek poleis of Egypt, before proceeding to the communities of the chora
(countr yside). Despite considerable variation in size, pretensions and the extent to
which they were hellenized, the chora communities shared a lack of autonomous
political institutions, and were all subject to the administration of royal officials. In
contrast to chapter 7, which traces the main outlines of Ptolemaic histor y, this chapter
aims to concentrate on tr ying to convey, from the wealth of evidence available,
something of what life was like for the ordinar y inhabitants of Ptolemaic Egypt.
2 Alexandria and the Other Greek Poleis of Egypt
The city of Alexandria was built on a low limestone ridge facing the island of Pharos,
already familiar to educated Greeks as the abode of Proteus (Hom.Od. 4.355) and to
become synonymous with the lighthouse built c. 280 B C by Sostratos of Knidos, one
Town and Countr y in Ptolemaic Egypt 251



of the seve n wond ers of the worl d. Constri cted by lake Mareoti s to the south, the city
was described by ancient writers as shaped like a chlamys (cloak), some 6 km east to
west but less than 2 km nor th to south. It s grid plan design was attr ibuted to the
famou s architect Dei nokrat es of Rhodes , and the unusuall y broad princip al stree ts,
bisecting each other, wer e a sou rce of mar vel fo r visitors to the city througho ut
antiquit y (Str abo 17 .1.8; cf. A ch. Tat. 6.1). Changes in the coastline due to seismic
activity and the silting up of the heptastadion (the causeway built to link Pharos to the
mainland, the reby creating two excellent harbour s), comb ined with the cont inuous
inhabi tation o f the site, h ave until recen t decade s seriousl y hampe red archaeo logical
investi gation of the ancie nt city . And even now , despite the specta cular result s of
rescue excavatio ns on land and under water explor ation of the ancie nt har bour and
palace ar eas (Emp ereur 1998; God dio et al. 1998) , our underst anding of its basic
topograp hy must star t from ancie nt descript ions, par ticu larly the det ailed eyew itness
account of Strabo (1 7.1.6±10 ) writt en only a few yea rs after the downf all of Kle opatra
and the Ptolema ic regim e.
Betwee n a quar ter and a third of the city' s tot al area was occup ied by the royal
palaces, which em braced Cape Lochia s and dominat ed the easter n side of the Great
harbour . In the palace area were situate d the famou s Muse um and Librar y , and the
monume ntal tomb of Alexande r and the Ptole mies; and there we re open spaces and
gardens to which the general pub lic we re admi tted, at least during festi vals (T heocr .
Id. 15; see below) . Nearb y was the theatre and the te mple of Poseidon . Fur ther
temples we re spre ad througho ut the city , includ ing one to the deified Arsinoe II; b ut
the most impor tant sa cred site was the great temple of Sarapis on a hill in the
southwe ster n district called Rhakotis. This, accord ing to ancien t tradi tion, had been
an Egyptian villag e before Alexande r ar rive d (Strabo 17.1 .6; cf. Ps.- Callisthen es
I.31.4 ) ± altho ugh it has recen tly bee n claimed that the name simply means `buildi ng
site' in Egyptian ± and ar ose from the native s' rathe r derog ator y way of refer ring to
the new Greek city (Chauv eau 2000: 57). But a predom inantly Egypt ian popul ation
in the adjace nt subur b of Necro polis is cer tainly implied by Strabo' s refere nce to
embalming there. Excavati on at the Sarapeu m ( the site of `Pompey' s Pillar'; actua lly a
monume nt of Diocl etian) has unear thed fo undation plaques whi ch clearl y date the
main temple to the reign of Ptole my III, alth ough evidenc e of earlier finds is
sugges tive of religio us acti vity on the site back to the star t of the Ptolema ic per iod,
if not earlier (Stam baugh 1972: 6). Th e temple was Helleni c in style, and the cult
statue anthropo morphi c (althoug h its attribution to Br yaxis poses a chronolo gical
dif ficulty; Clem . Al. Protr. 4.48); it is commonly held that Ptolemy I inaugurated the
cult to provide the immig rants with a religious fo cus that they could ident ify with
their new hom e but was not alie n to them like the Egypt ian zoomorp hic deitie s. This
may underes timate the sign ificance of Egyptian element s right from the star t (includ
ing the bilin gual foundat ion deposit s and pair of sphinx es whi ch may have for med a
dromos); indeed, the number of pharaonic-style statues recovered in the recent
under water ex cavations su ggests that the whol e city may have had a more Egyptian
visual aspect than has usually bee n assumed (Row e 1946: 14; Goddio et al. 1998).
In the middle of the city , between the pal ace area to the nor th-e ast and the perhap s
more Egyptiani zed religio us focal poi nt to the south-w est, wer e the mai n civi c
building s. It is sign ificant that Stra bo sing les ou t for par ticu lar me ntion the gymn a
sium and law cour t ( dikasterion), rather than more strictly political institutions, like a
252 Jane Rowlandson



pr ytaneion or bouleuterion; political activity was always seriously attenuated by the
overpowering royal presence, and at some point (maybe as one of Ptolemy VIII's
repressive measures in 145; Athen. 4.83, trans. Burstein 105) Alexandria lost itsboule
altogether. Nor do we hear of an active assembly. Yet membership of the citizen body
was strictly regulated, and organized into tribes and demes on the normal Greek
model, and the city enjoyed its own legal system (P.Hal. I; excerpted in Sel.Pap. II
201±2). Until ver y recently, Alexandrian evidence for domestic housing of Ptolemaic
date was entirely lacking, and inferences had to be drawn from tomb architecture; but
now rescue excavation has star ted to reveal houses back to the early third centur y with
mosaic flooring (Empereur 1998: 60±1), to be set alongside evidence from other
Delta sites, such as Athribis (Alston 2002: 236).
According to Diodoros, Alexandria in his day (c. 59 B C ) had 300,000 `free'
inhabitants, implying a total population of around half a million; a plausible enough
figure, even if we remain sceptical about Diodoros' testimony (17.52.6; cf. Rathbone
1990: 119±20). A sense of the unusually dense and cosmopolitan character of life in
the city is best conveyed by Theocritus' Idyll 15 of the 270s B C , a conversation
between two ladies attending an Adonis festival, in which the danger of the crowded
streets is repeatedly stressed:
O ye gods, what a big crowd! However are we to get through this crush, and how long
will it take? Ants, numberless and immeasurable! You've conferred a great many benefits
on us, Ptolemy, since your father (Ptolemy I) went of f to join the gods. Nowadays no
criminal harms the passer by, sneaking along in Egyptian fashion.
Later, the two women boast to one of the other onlookers of their Doric dialect,
reflecting their Syracusan (and ultimately Corinthian) ancestr y. A recent study has
confirmed that an identity and accent associated with one of old Greek cities, or with
Macedonia, was a mark of high status in the early Ptolemaic period, and that it was
not until the second centur y that the elite became more regularly identified with
Alexandria itself (Clar ysse 1998).
For such a large and cosmopolitan population lacking oppor tunities for political
expression, the spectacle of fered by frequent and magnificent festivals provided the
cement which united the disparate elements to one another, and all to the ruling
dynasty. While royal patronage could extend to the festival of any god (again illus
trated by Theocr. Id. 15), the greatest scope for the projection of Ptolemaic bounty
and power, both to the Alexandrian population and visitors to the city, lay in the
festivals for the cult of the ruling house itself. If this reached its apogee in the `Grand
Procession of Ptolemy Philadelphos' whose description is preser ved by Athenaeus
(5.197±203; Erskine 1995: 43±5; D. J. Thompson 2000), almost cer tainly one of the
earliest celebrations of the four-yearly Ptolemaieia, or festival of the deified Ptolemy I
and his queen Berenike I founded in 279, there were other royal festivals, notably the
Basileia (Austin 234), and the Arsinoeia in honour of Arsinoe II, deified on her death
in 270. The distinctive blue faience oinochoai, or `Queen Vases', presumably emanate
from the popular celebration of the cult of Arsinoe and later queens (D. B. Thompson
1973). A papyrus fragment of Satyrus' On the Demes of Alexandria also preser ves the
regulations for sacrificing to Arsinoe on altars of sand as the priestess made her way
through the streets (P.Oxy. XXVII 2465).
Town and Countr y in Ptolemaic Egypt 253



From Arsinoe II onwards, the Ptolemaic queens seem to have attracted a deep and
genuine af fection among the people of both Alexandria and Egypt as a whole. Thus
the murder of Arsinoe III in the power struggle at cour t following her husband's
death (Ptolemy IV, 204 B C ) provoked the Alexandrian population, including upper
class women and even children, to exact from the perpetrators and their families a
horrific revenge by which a controlled, charivari-like public humiliation (the women
were led naked, on horseback, to the stadium) culminated in their being literally torn
limb from limb (Polyb. 15.25±35, excerpted in Rowlandson 1998: no. 7; Barr y
1993). This riot set a trend, and the Alexandrians made several more inter ventions
in dynastic squabbles, ending with their insurgence in disapproval at Caesar's suppor t
of the young Kleopatra VII, during which par t of the Librar y allegedly went up in
flames (Fraser 1972: I.334±5, II.493±4). Lacking any legitimate means of political
expression, the Alexandrians found a way to make their voice heard.
With the foundation of Alexandria, Naukratis lost its raison d'e
Ã
tre as the main por t
for Greek trade with Egypt; in 380 B C , Nectanebo I had devoted a tithe of the
customs revenue from this trade to the nearby temple of Neith at Sais (Lichtheim
1980: 86±9. The pair of this `Naukratis stele' has recently been discovered by
under water excavations at the coastal por t of Thonis/Herakleion; Yoyotte 2002).
In fact Naukratis may have continued to have some role as a por t (Coulson 1996: 14),
and it cer tainly retained its status as a self-governing polis, although a resident royal
of ficial, oikonomos, super vised royal proper ty and interests in the city (OGIS 89; cf.
Sherk 1992: 268±9). But it seems gradually to have slipped into relative obscurity.
By contrast, Ptolemais (called Psoi in Egyptian) retained its impor tance to the end
of the Ptolemaic period. Strabo declared it the largest city of the Thebaid (Thebes had
been reduced to a series of villages by the rebellions of 88±85 and 26B C ), comparable
to Memphis in size and possessing a Greek constitution (17.1.42, 46). We can only
guess at an actual population figure ± a conser vative estimate would be around
50,000 (cf. D. J. Thompson 1988: 35) ± at any rate, it must have been perceptibly
larger than the ordinar y nome metropoleis . Sur viving city decrees provide testimony
to its Greek cultural, as well as political, life, with reference to a theatre, and including
a decree of the Dionysiac ar tists based in the city (OGIS 49, 50; cf. OGIS 48, trans.
Austin 233). Some of the settlers may have been drawn from Argos and Thessaly
(
SEG 20.665). From 215/4 B C , an eponymous dynastic cult was instituted at
Ptolemais parallel to that at Alexandria, which is reflected in the date clauses of
many private documents from Upper Egypt (Sherk 1992: 263±4). But the intended
role of Ptolemais as a bulwark of hellenism and loyalty to the dynasty in the south did
not prove sufficient to prevent the series of rebellions which af flicted that region in
par ticular from the end of the third centur y onwards.
3 The Impact of Greek Settlement in the Egyptian Chora
The popular Athenocentric view of Greeks as valuing political autonomy above all is
contradicted by the enthusiasm with which many immigrants to Egypt settled in
mixed rural communities with no vestige of self-government. Their aspirations for
wealth and social prestige were fulfilled in their new homes; and it is clear that,
par ticularly in the areas of most intensive settlement, the Fayum and nor thern par t
254 Jane Rowlan dson



of the Nile valley, considerable ef fort was put into creating the distinctive infrastruc
tures and ambience necessar y for a `civilized' Greek lifestyle.
This is seen most clearly, and may indeed have been most thoroughly put into
practice, at the `model town' of Philadelphia, whose ver y name (referring to Ptolemy
II's sister-wife Arsinoe Philadelphos) is testimony to its links with the ruling dynasty.
The 10,000 aroura (2,750 ha.) estate nearby which the king granted to his favoured
minister, Apollonios the dioiketes, was developed using the latest agricultural ideas
(not always approved of by the Egyptian workforce: Austin 240) under the super vi
sion of his assistant Zenon of Kaunos (in Karia), whose papers of some 2000 sur viving
letters and accounts provide a level of detailed knowledge unparalleled in the Hellen
istic world (Rostovtzef f 1922a; Orrieux 1983, 1985). Newly dug canals and irriga
tion ditches divided the whole area into regular rectangular por tions; the two Greek
staple crops, vines and olives, were planted on a massive scale, and experiments made
with novel cash crops such as poppies or the planting of two crops of wheat annually
(Orrieux 1983: 79±92; D. J. Thompson 1984; 1999b). The town of Philadelphia
itself was also laid out on an orderly grid plan, aligned parallel to the main ancient
canal, as an air photograph of 1925 shows clearly (Edgar 1931: plate 1). Although
strictly speaking it remained a kome (village) without any self-government, its size
and level of urbanism attracted ready settlers, who found it natural to describe it
as a polis:
Apollophanes and Demetrios, brothers, craftsmen in all the skills of weaving women's
clothing, to Zenon, greeting. If you please and you happen to have the need, we are
ready to provide what you need. For hearing of the reputation of thepolis in that you, its
leading man, are a good and just person, we have decided to come to Philadelphia to
you, we ourselves, and our mother and wife. (PSI IV 341, trans. Rowlandson 1998: no.
201)
Although lacking political institutions, Philadelphia possessed the two key Greek
cultural institutions, a gymnasium and theatre; there was also a stoa, a distinctively
Greek arcaded street. A wide range of temples ser ved Greek deities (Zeus, Demeter,
the Dioskouroi), Egyptian (Souchos, Thoeris, Poremanres), and Greco-Egyptian
(Isis and Sarapis), as well as the ruling dynasty (Arsinoe, the Brother-Sister gods;
the gods of Samothrace who were also par ticularly associated with Arsinoe) (Pestman
1981: II.512). Some private houses were built on an impressively grand scale,
designed and decorated according to Greek taste, as this decorator's estimate ad
dressed to Zenon reveals:
About the work in the house of Diotimos: for the por tico, [I under take] to have the
cornice painted with a purple border, the upper part of the wall variegated, the lower
course like vetch-seed, and the pediments with circular veining; providing myself with all
materials, for 30 drachmas. For the dining room with seven couches, I will do the vault
according to the pattern which you saw, and give the lower course an agreeable tint and
paint the Lesbian cornice, for 20 drachmas. And for the dining room with five couches, I
will paint the cornices, providing myself with all materials, for 3 drachmas. The sum total
is 53 drachmas. But if you provide ever ything, it will come to 30 drachmas. ( Sel.Pap. I
171; cf. P.Mich.Zenon 38)
Town and Countr y in Ptolemaic Egypt 255



If Philadelphia marked an extreme of development under royal patronage, all around
the Fayum similar developments were being under taken on a more modest scale.
Sur vey work at Kom Talit (ancient Taleithis) again shows regularly planned streets
aligned with a canal newly dug in the mid-third centur y (Kirkby and Rathbone
1996), and even at remote Soknopaiou Nesos on the barren nor thern shore of the
lake, the earliest settlement phase, also of the mid-third centur y, shows large, stone
built houses on a rectilinear plan (Boak 1935: 17±20). Connection with the ruling
dynasty was reflected in many Fayum village names, such as Theadelphia, Ptolemais,
Philotera (after a sister of Ptolemy II), Dionysias or Bacchias, as well as in the
designation of the whole region from c. 257 B C as the Arsinoite nome in honour of
Philadelphos' deified sister-wife Arsinoe.
Census records suggest that by the second half of the third centur y, sixteen per cent
of the population of the Fayum were classed as Greek, some militar y settlers (kleruchs)
and their families, others civilians; in some villages they formed over half the popula
tion (Clar ysse 1994: 75; D. J. Thompson 2001: 309). The introduction of a privil
eged `colonial' population on this scale undoubtedly led to jealousies and tensions
with the local inhabitants (such as over billeting: see Thompson, this volume, section
2), but for several reasons the social and ethnic composition of these rural commu
nities was ver y much more complex than a simple dichotomy between immigrant
Greek colonists and native Egyptians. For one thing, the expansion of agricultural
land meant that some of the Egyptians had relocated from other par ts of the countr y,
such as Heliopolis (Austin 240) or Oxyrhynchos (Pintaudi 1990). For another,
immigration was not confined to Greeks and other hellenized groups such as Thra
cians or Karians, but included Syrians, Jews, Samarians and other Semitic immigrants
from the Ptolemaic overseas empire. Even more significantly, the census records make
clear that some of those described as `Hellenes' and privileged by exemption from the
obol tax were in fact par tly or wholly of Egyptian ancestr y; it was possible to acquire
the status, for instance through ser vice in the civil administration (D. J. Thompson
2001). The records also show Greeks and Egyptians living in close proximity to one
another, in adjacent households, and although even with the help of these detailed
lists it is dif ficult to estimate confidently the extent of intermarriage, this undoubtedly
occurred. The Greeks resident in the Egyptian chora were not af fected by the legal
restrictions on marriage with non-citizens which applied to citizens of Greek poleis
(including presumably Alexandria ± although we do apparently find one marriage of
an Alexandrian citizen resident in the Fayum with an Egyptian woman; Clar ysse
1992: 51±2).
The settlement of kleruchs and civilians also occurred on a wide scale in the
nor thern par t of the Nile valley adjacent to the Fayum (and no doubt also in the
Delta, although evidence from that impor tant area of Egypt is ver y thin). Our best
evidence concerns the Herakleopolite and Oxyrhynchite nomes, mainly from the
cemeter y of El Hibeh, supplemented by later evidence from the same area. Here
the village names remained almost entirely Egyptian, with no suggestion of links with
the ruling dynasty; but the settlement of kleruchs at almost ever y village is demon
strated by the fact that plots of land continued to be known for many centuries
after wards by the name of the original recipient, for example `the kleros of Nikanor'
(Pruneti 1975; 1981; Falivene 1998). How actively these kleruchs were involved in
the actual cultivation of their land is a moot point; it was often leased out, par tly, it has
256 Jane Rowlandson



been argued, because the kler uchs themselves lacked the necessar y capital to make it
productive, and might prefer to hand it over to civilian middlemen who would
provide finance and hire Egyptians to work it (Bingen 1973; 1978b).
Apar t from private contracts like leases and loans, most of our documents relate to
routine local administration, such as collection of taxes in kind or money, or the arrest
of delinquents. For instance, a small group of letters addressed to a village of ficial
called Ptolemaios circa 245 BC
includes the following:
Zenodoros to Ptolemaios, greeting. When you receive this letter, send to us under guard
the woman who was handed over to you in possession of contraband oil, and send also
the person who handed her over to you. And if you do not stop your evil-doing in the
village, you will repent of it. Farewell. Year [.], Epeiph 10
th . (P.Hib. I 59)
Demophon to Ptolemaios, greeting. Do all you can to send me the flute-player Peto È u s
with both the Phr ygian flutes and the others; and if any expense is necessar y, pay it, and
you will get it back from me. Send me also Zenobios the feeble with a dr um and cymbals
and castanets, for he is wanted by the women in connection with the sacrifice; and let his
dress be as elegant as possible. Also get the kid from Aristion and send it to me. And if
you have apprehended the slave, hand him over to Semphtheus to bring to me. Send me
as many cheeses as you can, new ear thenware, all kinds of vegetables, and some relish if
you have any. Farewell. Put them on board with the guards who will assist in bringing the
boat. (P.Hib. I 54)
Interpreted within the context of literally thousands of other documents of similar
types, these texts illustrate many aspects of r ural society in this period, from the
working of the monopoly on the processing and disposal of oil crops (cf.P.Rev., trans.
BD 95) to the use of boats for much local, as well as long-distance, transpor t, the
reliance on personal contacts to provide both necessities and luxur y goods, or the
interpenetration of of ficial duties with the private interests of the colonial entrepre
neurs (cf. Orrieux 1983). The obscure reference to Ptolemaios' misdeeds reflects the
fact that even low level of ficials like Ptolemaios held power over the village commu
nity which, if misused, threatened to under mine the ideology whereby royal of ficials
were the instr uments which disseminated pharaoh's role as guarantor of Ma'at
(justice, or balance) to the people at large (D. Crawford 1978). Hence the need for
a multiplicity and apparent duplication of of ficials, all keeping check on one another
in the attempt to minimize abuse. The preparations, clearly for a local festival, fur ther
illustrate how closely newcomers and the native population could co-operate if they
wanted to; after all, both Greeks and Egyptians could enjoy a good festival, in the
villages of the chora no less than in the more opulent setting of Alexandria during the
`Grand Procession of Ptolemy Philadelphos'. Our information is ambiguous as to
whether the celebration under Demophon's patronage was basically Greek or Egyp
tian in form; Phr ygian flutes are familiar from the Greek world, but their player's
name is Egyptian, whereas castanet dancing was distinctively Egyptian, although
apparently provided by a Greek. This degree of integration is instr uctive at a date
when many Greeks would still be first- or second generation immigrants to Egypt.
The scale of Greek settlement in Middle Egypt south of Oxyrhynchos is dif ficult
to establish because of lack of evidence, although later documents suggest that
there must have been widespread kler uchic settlements there at some point in the
Town and Countr y in Ptolemaic Egypt 257



Ptolemaic period. Some Greeks were also settled under the first two Ptolemies in the
Thebaid, notably at the strategic point of Elephantine island opposite modern Aswan
(the location of a Jewish garrison in the fifth centur y), from which comes the earliest
sur viving marriage contract in Greek (P.Eleph. 1, dated 311 B C ; cf. Por ten et al.
1996), and at Edfu (Sel.Pap. II 207; Lukaszewicz 1999). Kleruchic settlement in
the Apollonopolite nome (of which Edfu was the metropolis) was never on a large
scale, however; in 119/8 the nome had only some 657 arouras of kleruchic land
compared with over 20,000 arouras of `privately owned' land (P.Haun. inv. 407;
contrast Kerkeosiris, section 4 below). And generally, evidence from this region
suggests the persistence of earlier patterns of land tenure and social structure to
which the relatively few immigrants brought only slow change, par ticularly in the
third centur y, before rebellion provoked more active royal inter vention through
garrisons and `dynastic' urban foundations (Manning 1999; 2003; Thompson, this
volume, section 5, cf. also section 4 below).
Thebes itself, despite a number of attestations of Greeks from the 290sB C onwards,
all in demotic Egyptian texts (Clar ysse 1995; Depauw 2000: 52), remained over
whelmingly Egyptian in ambience, under the influence of the hugely wealthy and
ancient temples and their priestly families. Even the non-Egyptologist can gain some
sense of the milieu in which these families lived ± and not only the wealthiest ± from
the collections of family papers which they carefully preser ved in their houses
(Depauw 1997: 156±7; 2000). Because the texts are predominantly in demotic,
these `family archives' from Thebes are perhaps less well-known to non-specialists
than similar archives from elsewhere in Egypt (section 4 below; cf. Lewis 1986:
chapters 6 and 8), but they deser ve attention not least because several date back to
the ver y early Ptolemaic period, when documentation in Greek is scarce. One of the
most interesting relates not to a single family, but traces the histor y of a house
through a series of transactions over fifty years from 324, when the first-attested
owner, Djufachi, assigned it jointly to two of his sons, Petechons and Phib (other
adjacent proper ty went to another son) who only many years later divided it physically
into two separate dwellings. In 315, it was included (still undivided) in Petechons'
marriage agreement; and twenty years after that Petechons' widow used her now
divided share as security for a loan, selling it two years later to the mor tgagee, Pleehe.
In 290, Pleehe entered into a detailed contract with his neighbour Tahib allowing her
to extend her house up to his west wall, provided that she inser ted no new timbers
into his wall, and left an adequate light well opposite his two windows. Subsequently,
Pleehe made the proper ty over to his wife, Teihor, who after his death sold the house
in 279 to its last known owner, another woman, Teianteus, from whose period of
occupancy we have a series of tax receipts and a lease of the house to her sister
(Glanville 1939; Pestman 1989).
This example provides insight into both the physical conditions in which the
residents of Thebes (and of smaller communities throughout the Nile valley) lived,
with dark mud-brick houses crammed closely against each other overshadowing the
narrow streets, and into the social and legal relationships of the families who lived in
such close proximity to one another, and who mostly came from the lower echelons
of the priesthood (for instance, Pleehe is entitled `lector of the Ape'). Modest though
these mud-brick constructions were, they represented a source of wealth that could
be used as security against a loan or a dowr y, as well as the space in which wife and
258 Jane Rowlandson



husband hoped to raise children who would inherit. We can see the sophistication of
the Egyptian legal system before it had interacted to any extent with that of the
immigrant Greeks (cf. also the existence of demotic Egyptian legal `handbooks':
Depauw 1997: 113±14). Records of each transaction were carefully preser ved, to
be produced in cour t in the event of any dispute arising with neighbours or other
family members, such as the so-called `Hermias case' (P.Tor.Choach.), or the family
dispute from Siut (P. BM 10591 published by H. Thompson 1934). Anyone familiar
with the treatment of women in Greek law will also note that here women appear as
par ties to contracts without the need for any male guardian, and their favourable
treatment with regard to marital proper ty (see fur ther Pestman 1961; Smith 1995).
The Ptolemies were responsible for relatively little building work in the temple
complexes at Thebes, and it is dif ficult to escape the conclusion that they viewed its
powerful and conser vative priestly establishment with suspicion (in contrast to their
close relationship with the priests of Ptah at Memphis; Thompson, this volume,
section 3). They preferred to counterbalance Theban power by patronizing major
rebuilding projects at other religious sites in the south, most notably the temple of
Isis at Philai (begun under Ptolemy II), and that of Horus at Edfu, begun in 237
under Ptolemy III (Arnold 1999). This unfor tunately left too little vested suppor t at
Thebes for the Ptolemaic state to prevent its secession for two decades from 207/6
B C under two rebel pharaohs who, whatever the original cause of the rebellion, played
the `nationalist' propaganda card (Thompson, this volume, section 5).
4 Ethnicity and Society in the Late Ptolemaic Chora
By 186 B C , when the royal power of Ptolemy V was finally restored throughout the
countr y, Greeks and Egyptians had been living side by side in the chora for several
generations. The combination of social mobility and intermarriage had produced a
more ethnically and culturally mixed population than the documents super ficially
suggest (Clar ysse 1985 and fur ther below). However, we continue to find isolated
instances of racial tension (always surprisingly rare in our sources), perhaps inflamed
by the `nationalistic' colour of the rebellions against the state (examples in Goudriaan
1988, especially 42±57, on Ptolemaios the `Recluse' at the Memphite Sarapeion,
widely discussed elsewhere).
The consequences for a small town community, both of the continued unrest
through the second and early first centuries, and of government measures to restore
order, can be traced in detail in the unusually well-documented case of Pathyris
(modern Gebelein), some 30 km south of Thebes. It was a garrison town (one of
four strategically located to the nor th and south of Thebes), and when the garrison
was reinforced in the mid-second centur y, it became the home of a cavalr y officer
called Dr yton, a citizen of Ptolemais perhaps of Cretan descent. He already had an
eight-year-old son, Esthladas, by a former wife Sarapias (who was also a citizen ±aste
± of Ptolemais), but in 150 married Apollonia alias Senmouthis of a local Greco
Egyptian family, whose father and other male ascendants were infantr ymen from the
politeuma of the Cyreneans (a form of militar y association, membership of which
may, but does not necessarily, point to some real Cyrenaean ancestr y).
On any account, Dr yton's family illustrates the ethnic and cultural complexities of
Ptolemaic society at this period, but the precise interpretations put upon the evidence
Town and Countr y in Ptolemaic Egypt 259



have varied considerably (not least because new documents come to light). Whereas
Lewis (1986: 88±103) saw Dr yton's marriage to Apollonia as leading to his `Egyp
tianization' after the relatively `pure' Greek milieu of Ptolemais, more recently
Vandorpe has argued that Dr yton was already used to dealing with Egyptian legal
contracts before he met Apollonia, and that on the contrar y, it was she who, with his
assistance, gradually began to conduct her business activities in Greek (Vandorpe
2002a; 2002b). In this, she was following a more general pattern (see below), but it is
interesting that after Dr yton's death in 126, we hear no more of Apollonia's business
activities, and the couple's five daughters do not seem to have continued the hellen
izing trend. In his last will (superseding two earlier ones) of 29 June 126, Dr yton
made an approximately equal division of his proper ty between Esthladas on the one
hand (who also received his father's armour and horse, having followed him in a
militar y career), and the five daughters on the other. This reflects less a characteristic
ally Greek preference for males over females in succession than an attempt to achieve a
balance between the of fspring of his two marriages; after all, if he had not remarried,
Esthladas would have inherited the whole estate. More obvious Greek influence is
seen in Dr yton's possession of four household slaves attested by the will (probably all
female, and with impeccably Greek names). But four of the five known witnesses to
the will signed in Egyptian demotic, `because in these places there is not a suf ficient
number of Greeks' (P.Grenf. I 21 with Pap. Lugd.-Bat. XIX 4 ii 1±25, widely
reproduced and translated).
This interesting archive also directly documents how the entire population of
Egypt was potentially af fected by the political unrest of the later second centur y. In
130 Esthladas, who was ser ving with the forces of Ptolemy VIII in the civil war
against his sister Kleopatra II, wrote home to reassure his family:
Esthladas to his father and his mother (sc. stepmother), greeting and good health. As I
write to you frequently to keep up your courage and take care of yourself until things
settle down, once again please reassure yourself and our household. For news has come
that Paos (the king's general) is sailing up in the month of Tybi ( the following month)
with suf ficient forces to subdue the mobs in Hermonthis and deal with them as rebels.
(Sel.Pap. I 101; Burstein 44)
We can sense here the ner vousness of a family, whose entire livelihood and social
identity was constituted through loyal ser vice to the king, in face of a violent threat to
his rule. The conflict was by no means a simple opposition between `Greeks' and
`Egyptians'; but the dissension within the Ptolemaic ruling house provided an occa
sion for the pursuit and magnification of more local enmities. The priests of
Hermonthis and Pathyris were embroiled in a decades-long land dispute ( P.Lond.
VII 2188; cf. Van't Dack et al. 1989: 39±48); hardly surprising, then, that the two
neighbouring towns found themselves on opposite sides in the civil war. Some years
later political unrest again impinged on the family, when Dr yton's five daughters
complained to the regional governor that one Ariston son of Athenodotos of Thebes
`in times of unrest' had violently occupied the vineyard they inherited from their
father and claimed it for his own (P.Lond. II 401: 13, trans. Rowlandson 1998:
no. 87).
260 Jane Rowlandson



Other texts to sur vive from later Ptolemaic Pathyris include a register of landhold
ings (P. Berlin 13608), and a plan using coloured ink and annotated in Greek and
demotic (P. Cairo 31163), as well as several fur ther bilingual family archives (Depauw
1997: 130, 152, 155±6). One such archive, consisting of 21 documents in Greek and
49 in demotic, may have been discovered intact in the original pot (P.Adler; cf. the
contemporar y archive of Totoes, found in two pots at Deir el Medina: Depauw 1997:
156±7). The use of Greek for legal documents progressively expanded at the expense
of Egyptian, par tly because after 146 B C demotic contracts required registration in
Greek to be fully ef fective (Depauw 1997: 24); and paradoxically, the protection
of fered to Egyptian law in the `Amnesty Decree' of 118 B C only accelerated this trend
(Austin 231, lines 207±20; Pestman 1985). But Greek texts star t to reflect Egyptian
legal practices; for instance, the woman Nahomsesis regularly employed Greek con
tracts without using a guardian, despite apparently not being literate in Greek herself
(Rowlandson 1998: no. 184). The texts from Pathyris end abruptly in 88 B C , when
the Thebaid experienced yet another rebellion.
Land allotments to soldiers continued to be made right through the second
centur y and beyond, though now the recipients were not immigrants, but locally
born, and the apparent ethnic distinction between machimoi (Egyptian foot-soldiers)
and the higher status `Macedonians of the katoicic cavalr y' who received larger plots
is not all it seems. This, among other aspects of late Ptolemaic rural society, is best
illustrated from the papers of Menches, village secretar y (komogrammateus) of Ker
keosiris in the penultimate decade of the second centur y. A recent study has done
much to elucidate the precise nature of this `archive' (the sur viving texts were
discarded from the village secretar y's archive, reused for various private jottings,
and later formed the wrappings of 26 mummified crocodiles at nearby Tebtunis!),
and the activities of Menches himself (Verhoogt 1998). Kerkeosiris was a remote and
not ver y prosperous agricultural village, with thin soil overlying the limestone bed
rock, and af flicted by sand sweeping in from the deser t; the texts reveal a constant
struggle against derelict land. It is surprising, therefore, to find Menches in regular
contact not only with other local and regional officials, but also with the dioiketes in
Alexandria. Whether this was typical of Ptolemaic village secretaries it is dif ficult to
say; Menches enjoyed the patronage of an influential cour tier named Dorion (who
apparently paid the fee to renew Menches' term of office;P.Tebt. I 9±11, trans. Austin
260), and he held of fice at a time when there was an attempt to restore good
administration after the chaotic conditions of civil war between Ptolemy VIII and
his former wife Kleopatra II (see Menches' copy of the famous `Amnesty Decree' of
118; P.Tebt. I 5, trans. Austin 131).
Much of Menches' duties concerned the administration and reclamation of land,
and sur viving texts include not only a summar y of the entire village lands for 118B C
(P.Tebt. I 60), but also registers detailing the precise use of individual plots (of which
D. Crawford 1971 remains the fundamental study, although fur ther texts have since
been published in P.Tebt. IV). Of a total area of 4700 arouras, Crown land comprised
almost half (2427 ar.), and kleruchic land almost another third (1565 ar.). The village
itself occupied some 70 ar. There was surprisingly little sacred land (292 ar.), orchards
were ver y scarce (21 ar.), and no privately owned land is listed at all (contrast the
figures for Edfu, above). All known landholders were male, another significant

contrast with our evidence from Upper Egypt (and indeed with the neighbouring
Herakleopolite nome; see BGU XIV: 226)
Women do appear incidentally in some texts, however, including as victims of a
curious raid on the homes of several farmers of Crown land one summer day in 113
B C , during which household furniture, possessions and items of women's and chil
dren's clothing were stolen (P.Tebt. I 45±7, IV 1095±6). The Greek names of the
ringleaders, Pyrrhichos son of Dionysios, katoicic cavalr yman, and Herakleios son of
Posidippos, might make one suspect ethnic tension as the cause of trouble (cf. Lewis
1986: 121), but this is never stated explicitly; and by well before this period, names
had come to reflect a person's social position rather than ethnicity (Clar ysse 1985,
1992). Thus `Maron alias Nektsaphthis son of Petosiris' gradually mutated over a
number of years (apparently on promotion from the lower ranks into the katoicia)
into `Maron son of Dionysios, Macedonian of the katoicic cavalr y' (P.Tebt. I p. 547;
cf. D. Crawford 1971: 134±5). Maron may have wanted to leave his Egyptian identity
behind; but it was common to keep both a Greek and an Egyptian name on a
permanent basis, using each in the appropriate context. So Menches was also
known as Asklepiades, and his whole family had double names. This practice went
far up the social scale: at Edfu, Ptolemaios/Pamenches who held the cour t rank of
`kinsman' under Ptolemy VIII, is commemorated with his wife and son in two quite
separate series of grave monuments, in Egyptian hieroglyphs and Greek verse respect
ively (Yoyotte 1969; cf. D. J. Thompson 2001: 315±16).
Thus by the late Ptolemaic period, although Greek and Egyptian culture remained
largely distinct, many individuals were ef fectively `bicultural'. This included many,
perhaps most, of the katoicic kleruchs. Their kleroi, originally revocable by the King,
had now become hereditar y, and even alienable to others of similar status, creating a
stable, comfor tably of f, landowning class throughout the chora (Bingen 1983). The
Egyptian background of this class (despite their apparently wholly Greek persona
when viewed through Greek texts) is well illustrated by a unique demotic will of Heti,
a katoicic cavalr yman from Panopolis in 69 B C . Heti was evidently so much more at
home with Egyptian as not merely to buck the general trend towards the use of Greek
for private contracts, but even to impor t into Egyptian from Greek law the concept of
a will, which was alien to the Egyptian legal tradition (Malinine 1967; cf. with caution
Oates 2001).
Heti's house was situated in the nor th-west quar ter of Panopolis, a nome metro
polis. We also find katoicic cavalr ymen residing in the metropolis (all in the street of
Kleopatra Aphrodite) in the few documents to sur vive from Oxyrhynchos over the
last half-centur y of Ptolemaic rule (earlier texts from this site, one of our main sources
for the Roman period, have presumably succumbed to damp). But whether these
cases are representative of a more general trend amongkleruchs (or other landholders)
to move from villages into the metropolis, we are unfor tunately unable to assess
through lack of evidence. While we may share Bingen's (1975) scepticism of the
traditional view that Ptolemaic metropoleis were mere agglomerations of population,
no better than villages in the facilities they offered, the fact is that neither written nor
archaeological evidence has yet allowed detailed study of any Ptolemaic metropolis
(other than the exceptional Memphis and Thebes of course).
Roman rule undoubtedly encouraged the metropoleis to flourish at the expense of
the surrounding villages, developing the appearance and infrastructure of Greek
262 Jane Rowlandson



cities. The Roman administration classed the entire population of the chora (other
than Roman citizens; and citi zens of Alexandri a, Naukratis and Ptolema is) as `Egyp
tians ', whi le privileging within this group some me tropolitan reside nts (given reduced
poll tax, and memb ership of a more hell enized `gy mnasial' class) . In bo th respect s this
marked, n ot a fundam ental change of direction for the relationshi p of tow n and
count r y , but an acute recognition of the complex et hnic and cultural legacy of the
Ptolema ic period.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Jews and Greeks
Erich S. Gruen
Alexander the Great burst like a thunderbolt upon the histor y of the Near East.
Within a dozen years in the late fourth centur y B C , he humbled the mighty Persian
empire, marching its length and breadth, defeating its armies, toppling its satraps,
terminating its monarchy and installing a Greek hegemony from the Hellespont to
the Indus. No direct confrontation occurred between the great Macedonian con
queror and the Jews of Palestine. Fanciful tales sprang up later, in which Alexander
paid homage to the High Priest in Jerusalem and Yahweh sanctioned his subjugation
of Persia (Jos. AJ 11.304±5). None of them has a basis in fact. Palestine was of small
interest to the king who captured the great for tress of Tyre, then marched straight to
Egypt and subsequently to Mesopotamia, on the way to the hear tland of the Persian
empire. Judaea was spared ± and largely ignored.
The long-term impact on Jewish histor y and culture, however, was enormous. The
encounter of Jews with the language, literature and learning of the Hellenic world
created a cultural revolution. The Greeks may not have noticed it much. But ancient
Judaism was never quite the same again. The adjustments entailed by that encounter
played a profound role in the reshaping of Jewish self-conception.
The interplay of Hellenism and Judaism is an endlessly fascinating subject. Did it
constitute a confrontation? The coming of the Greeks to the world of the Jews has
generally been viewed as a threat to tradition and faith. Increasing Hellenization
would entail erosion of ancestral Jewish practice and belief. The Jews, on this
interpretation, faced a choice: either assimilation or resistance to encroaching pagan
culture. Indeed the terms `Hellenism' and `Judaism' (or `Hellenism' and `Hebraism')
have ser ved as metaphors for a tension between reason and religion, between ration
ality and spirituality, throughout the ages.
The matter is not so simple. This was no zero-sum game in which ever y win for
Hellenism was a loss for Judaism ± or vice versa. Nor did adaptation to the Greek
world necessarily require compromise of Jewish principle or practice. To take only the
most striking illustration, when a Greek gymnasium, a central exemplar of Hellenic
society, was introduced into Jerusalem in the early second centur y B C , the Jewish
High Priest himself installed it on his own initiative. And other Jewish priests soon



found themselves in the palaestra, engaging in physical exercise and exploiting the
institution to their advantage (II Macc. 4.9). They evidently did not regard this
activity as undermining their priestly duties for the Temple. The notion of an irre
concilable cultural conflict needs to be abandoned.
Jews had previously lived under a Persian yoke, a light one and a relatively benign
one. The centres of royal power lay at a great distance, in Susa and Persepolis, with
little direct ef fect upon the society of the Jews. A major change occurred with the
coming of the Greeks. Alexander's vast holdings splintered after his death, as his
power ful marshals divided and fought fiercely over the territories he had claimed. In
the new configurations of the Hellenistic kingdoms, Greco-Macedonian dynasts held
sway and Hellenism became the culture of the r uling class in the major cities and
states, both old and new, of the Near East, in places like Sardis and Ephesos, in
Alexandria and Antioch, in Babylon, in Tyre and Sidon and in the coastal commu
nities of Palestine.
1 The Homeland
The political constellation af fected Jews ever ywhere ± most directly and immediately
in the homeland. The Ptolemies ruled Palestine for about a centur y, from the time of
Ptolemy I's occupation of the land at the end of the four th centur y to its acquisition
by the Seleukids at the beginning of the second centur y. How firm or loose that r ule
was is dif ficult to say. Militar y governors exercised authority, and revenues were
earmarked for Alexandria. But the Ptolemies leased out tax collection to contractors,
often, if not regularly, local or regional figures, like the Jewish family of the Tobiads
(Tcherikover 1959: 59±73). In Judaea itself, the High Priest retained a position of
eminence, with extensive religious and political authority. He governed in collabor
ation with respected Jewish leaders in Jer usalem. The Ptolemies would have little
need for or purpose in repressing local governance, so long as the area remained
stable ± and continued to produce revenues (Hengel 1974: 18±47).
Nor did Ptolemaic overlordship require the imposition of Hellenic culture upon
the inhabitants of Palestine. But the infiltration of Hellenism seeped inevitably into
the land. Cities with a hybrid population of Greeks and indigenous peoples emerged
along the Mediterranean coast from Acco-Ptolemais to Raphia, in Transjordan from
Gadara to Philadelphia-Ammon, and around Lake Tiberias. The existence of Greek
speaking communities (even if the ethnic mix was diverse) which adopted names like
Apollonia, Pella, Dion, Ptolemais, Philadelphia and Skythopolis was bound to pene
trate the consciousness of the Jews (Schu È rer 1979: 85±183). Commercial contacts
increased the interconnections and made use of the Greek language a convenience.
Ser vice by Jews as mercenaries or as functionaries in the Ptolemaic administration
accelerated the process. And intermarriages blurred older boundaries. Palestine
became par t of a larger Hellenistic world. The political and religious institutions of
Judaea retained their integrity. Jewish traditions, laws and allegiance to the teachings
of the Torah remained undiminished. But Judaea was no island for tress. Greek
practices, language and learning would gradually show their impact.
International rivalries super vened to shake up the political str ucture. The energetic
young Seleukid r uler Antiochos III revived the for tunes of his house in the late third
centur y. His aggressive campaigns of 219 and 218 wrested much of Phoenicia and
Jews and Greeks 265



Palestine from the grasp of the Ptolemies (Gera 1998: 9±20). The gains proved to be
temporar y as Antiochos suf fered a celebrated defeat at Ptolemaic hands in the battle of
Raphia in 217. But when Ptolemy IV Philopator died c. 204, leaving a young boy on
the throne of Egypt, surrounded by ambitious advisors unpopular among their own
people, Antiochos seized the occasion for a renewed invasion. This time success was
enduring. In the `Fifth Syrian War' Antiochos captured Jerusalem, drove Ptolemaic
garrisons out of Palestine, and took full control of the countr y (Gera 1998: 23±35).
The Jews were beneficiaries rather than victims. They (or at least some of them)
had assisted the Seleukid cause in expelling Ptolemaic forces from the citadel in
Jerusalem in 198. In return, Antiochos promised to rebuild those par ts of the city
ravaged by war, authorized completion of work on the Temple, supplied animals for
the sacrifice, food and other needs, abolished taxes for three years, relieved the people
of one third of their tribute so as to restore losses, granted special exemptions to the
Jewish, priests, and other Temple functionaries and pronounced his guarantee that
Jews could live under their own laws (Jos. AJ 12.138±44). The documents that
carried these declarations were, to be sure, delivered to the Jews by a Seleukid official
acting on the king's orders. Royal authority in the region was unquestioned. But the
arrangements between Antiochos and the Jews were negotiated by a Jewish represen
tative (II Macc. 4.11). And the favours bestowed indicate a willingness on the par t of
the Syrian regime to promote internal autonomy in Judaea, backed by the resources
of the Seleukids. The policy did not stem from altruism. It would add stability to the
situation and earn the Seleukids wider suppor t against any reintroduction of Ptolem
aic influence.
The collaboration bore fruit. Appointment of the High Priest was subject to
ratification by the king. But that of fice remained in the hands of the Oniads, who
had long enjoyed its prerogatives. A smooth relationship held between Antiochos III
and the High Priest Simon the Just. And that cordiality endured into the next
generation between Antiochos' successor, Seleukos IV and Simon's successor Onias
III. Seleukos indeed pursued his predecessor's favours toward Jerusalem, paying
conspicuous honour to the Temple, and subsidizing the sacrifices out of his own
pocket (II Macc. 3.1±3).
Tensions mounted, however, in the last years of Seleukos IV and the beginning of
the reign of his successor, Antiochos IV Epiphanes. Internal quarrels within the
Jewish establishment sparked the troubles, a clash between the High Priest Onias
III and the overseer of the Temple, Simon, each appealing to the Seleukid cour t for
inter vention. Seleukos IV was tempted by the prospect of utilizing money from the
Temple treasur y, but did not press the matter over Jewish objections. Divisions within
the Jewish leadership widened when a new ruler took the Seleukid throne in 175.
Onias' brother Jason seized the oppor tunity to ingratiate himself with Antiochos IV,
offering increased revenues to the Seleukids in return for suppor t for his claims on the
High Priesthood. Backing from Antioch put Jason in control and allowed him to
institute a gymnasium, an ephebate and a community of `Antiochenes' in Jerusalem
(II Macc. 3±4). The events, striking and memorable, have generally been taken as the
forcible imposition of `Hellenism' upon the Jews by a `Hellenizing par ty' implement
ing the wishes of Antiochos IV (e.g. Hengel 1974: 277±309).
Matters were not so simple. The initiative came from Jason, not from Antiochos.
And nothing in the evidence indicates resistance to the Greek institutions that Jason
266 Erich S. Gruen



introduced. The construction of a gymnasium implies that Greek schooling had
already earned a place in Judaea. The priests themselves welcomed the gymnasium
and suppor ted games in the palaestra. The adoption of Greek names like Jason,
Menelaos and Antigonos by some in the Jewish elite suggests that Hellenic culture
had already become par t of the social scene in Jerusalem. Jason had taken advantage
of a new man on the Seleukid throne to press his own agenda. The episode represents
competition for power within Judaea, not a clash between Hellenism and Judaism.
The fact was underscored three years later when Menelaos, another member of the
priestly establishment but not of Oniad lineage, outbid Jason in turn for the favour of
Antiochos and was awarded the High Priesthood (II Macc. 4.23±9). The king, it
appears, took little interest in the fraternal squabbles of the Judaean aristocracy. His
eyes were trained on a prospective invasion of Egypt, the eve of the Sixth Syrian War.
For that purpose additional cash from Jerusalem would come in handy. Co-operation
with Menelaos would ser ve his ends. Antiochos conducted no campaign of coercive
Hellenization. Egypt was the objective.
The king, in fact, led two expeditions into Egypt, in 170/169 and in 168. With
Menelaos' assistance he entered the Temple in Jerusalem and car ted of f some of its
treasures to finance his militar y ventures (I Macc. 1.20±8; II Macc. 5.15±21). The
second invasion ended badly. The Roman legate Popillius Laenas, his arm
strengthened by Rome's victor y in the Third Macedonian War, arrived in Egypt in
168 and brusquely demanded Antiochos' withdrawal from that land. The Seleukid
monarch had no recourse but to comply. The consequences proved to be grave for
the Jews. There had been further internal upheaval in Judaea, as Jason's faction had
re-emerged to oust Menelaos from power, but then engaged in a reign of terror that
backfired and drove Jason once again to Transjordan. Antiochos Epiphanes returned
to Jerusalem and ordered widespread massacre and enslavement in 168. And that was
only the beginning. In the following year, the king sent forces to occupy the citadel,
terrorize the populace, and install a militar y colony. Dissident Jews fled to the deser t
and the mountains. Antiochos then imposed his most extreme measures in late 167.
He forbade sacrifices in the Temple, ordered erection of pagan altars, banned circum
cision, burned copies of the Torah and engaged in wholesale violations of Jewish
practices. The Temple itself was re-dedicated to Zeus Olympios, and pigs were
slaughtered on the altar. Jews who refused to conform were ruthlessly punished
(Tcherikover 1959: 175±203).
The cataclysmic events mark a critical moment in Jewish histor y. Resistance to
Antiochos' persecutions began as a guerrilla movement, then swelled into an army
under Judas Maccabaeus. When the king turned his attention to other adventures in
the east, Judas and his followers inflicted a series of defeats upon the royal forces sent
to quell the rebellion. The Jewish successes culminated in the recover y of Jerusalem,
then the cleansing and re-dedication of the Temple in December of 164, a moment
celebrated through the ages and to this ver y day with the festival of Hanukkah (Bar
Kochva 1989: 151±290).
It is easy and tempting to interpret these dramatic developments as a confrontation
of Jew and Greek, a clash of Judaism and Hellenism, the reasser tion of the nation's
traditions against the coercive application of an alien culture (e.g. Bickermann 1937:
117±36; Tcherikover 1959: 152±74, 193±203). But the dichotomy is deceptive and
misleading. Hellenism had long since entered into the life of Palestinian Jews (Hengel
Jews and Greeks 267



1974: 58±106). The tur moi l of the se years arose from inter n al tensions and competi
tive rivalri es. And Antio chos Epiphanes had shown no inclin atio n before or after to
conduct a cr usade of forcing Helleni c cultu re down the throats of the pe oples in his
empire. His violent reactions in the wake of his c ompelle d withdrawa l from Egypt
may reflec t an ef fo r t to reass er t his powe r and to halt any percei ved decline in his
author ity in the Near East, or to pun ish recalci trant Jews who had ra ised tum ult
during his absence in Egypt. But the re is little to indica te that he soug ht to conve r t
subjec t peoples to Hell enism (Gr uen 1 993a).
Nor, for that matt er, did Judas Macca baeus repr esent himself as a relentl ess foe of
Greeks and the Seleuki d empire, let alone of `Hell enizers' amon g his own count r y
men. He directed his milit ar y campai gns in lar ge par t agains t ene mies who had
dwelled in the lands su r rounding Judae a long befor e the advent of the Greeks. Insofar
as Judas rallie d his forces against the foe, he hoisted a bibli cal standa rd aimed at the
indige nous dwelle rs of the reg ion, not primaril y aga inst the Greeks themse lves.
Clashes bet ween Jewish forc es and Seleuki d ar mie s occup y a prime place in the
historiog raphy of the Macca baean era. But the y sho uld not obscure the intera ction
of Jew and Gre ek at the leade rship lev el. Repeate d negotiat ions took place between
the Seleuki d of ficiald om and the Jews during the lifetim e of Judas Macca baeus. The
pacts and agreemen ts proved to be shor t-lived , mere temporar y cessations of ho stility .
But a more fundam ental un derstanding endured . T he Seleukids backed of f from
requiri ng abandonm ent of Jewish fa ith or confor mity with Hell enic practice s. Anti
ochos IV had bee n an aber ration. And his successors did not revive su ch policies.
Inter mittent hostilit ies continue d. But a patt er n of recipr ocal relations and mutual
depen dency took sh ape in subs equent decade s, no ir remedia ble antagon ism (Gr uen
1998: 3±12).
Hasm onaean (Macc abaean famil y) pre-emine nce in Judaea sur viv ed Judas' deat h in
160. His brother Jonathan took the reins of leadership and maintained a modus
vivendi with the Seleukids. Indeed, rivalries within the Seleukid house played into
Jonathan's hands. Contende rs fo r the Syrian throne soug ht his su ppor t for their
ambiti ons, rew arded his assis tance with appoi ntmen t to the High Priesth ood, and
designated him as `friend of the king ' (I Macc. 10.15±21). The ar rangement basically
restored the situa tion that held prio r to Antio chos IV: the Jewish High Priest
exercised auth ority in Jer usalem under the patronag e of the Seleuki d r uler . Relatio ns
were of ten rocky , an d shifti ng fo r tune s might bring setbacks . But paral lel advant ages
undergirde d the relationshi p. The king s needed Jewish su ppor t to shore up their
positio ns against rivals and pretende rs, and the crown's imprim atur gave vital backing
to Hasmonaea n leade rship within Judaea. Distinct ions confer red upo n the Hig h
Priest also decla red the king 's right to bestow them.
The accessio n of Simon, yet another br other, to powe r after the death of Jonathan
in 143 marked no break in the patter n. Despit e claims in the sources (I Macc.
13.33±42 ; Jos. AJ 13.2 13±4) that his years broug ht a shaking of f of the Seleuki d
yoke and real autonom y for the Jews, the evi dence sugge sts a more nuance d picture .
Deme trios II prov ided a peace treaty , auth ority over the for tresses that Jews had built ,
a rem ission of taxes and enrolm ent of the Jews into Seleukid forces. But Simo n had
initiated the negot iations, and his reque st, in ef fect , conced ed the station of the
overlord. It was Dem etrios who forgav e all the `er rors and of fences ' committ ed by
the Jews (I Macc. 13.36±40). The Seleukid vant age-point takes precedence. And the
268 Erich S. Gruen



Jews' own inscription, af fixed to a monument on Mt. Zion in 140, records that the
Syrian monarch himself secured for Simon the of fice of High Priest, made him one of
the king's Friends, and accorded him great honour (I Macc. 14.25±49).
Enhancement of Hasmonaean authority came not through successes against the
Seleukids, but through weakness and divisions within the Syrian realm. Simon's
re-occup ancy of the citadel in Jer usalem constituted a gain of high symbolic signifi
cance. But the patter n of Seleukid contenders seeking Hasmonaean suppor t and
Hasmonaeans backing first one, then another of the Seleukid rivals persisted into
the High Priesthood of Simon's son John Hyrkanos. Hasmonaeans still controlled
Judaea as sur rogates for Seleukid power. Inter minable civil strife within the house of
Seleukos allowed Jewish ambitions to burst for mer confines. Hyrkanos' expansionism
included Hasmonaean advances into Transjordan, Idumaea and Samaria ± but no
assaults on Seleukid centres (Tcherikover 1959: 238±51). Hyrkanos' successor Aris
toboulos became the first of his line to take the title of king and don the diadem (Jos.
AJ 13.301; BJ 1.70). The move proclaimed a station equal to that of Hellenistic
r ulers. And the long reign of Alexander Jannaeus from 103 to 76 unders cored the rise
in inter national stature. Jannaeus conducted major militar y campaigns in Transjordan
and the Galilee, issuing in the reduction of numerous Hellenistic cities by his forces
(Schu È rer 1973: 219±28). The Hasmonaeans had now broken decisively with Antioch.
There was nothing more to be gained from the disintegrating dynasty whose inter nal
splits forecast impending doom. But Jannaeus' operations brought him within the
shadow of the Ptolemaic realm, stir red the forces of Egypt against him, and com
pelled him to engage in devious negotiations with the r ulers of that nation (Jos. AJ
13.324±355). Even in the reign of Jannaeus, most conspicuous for independence of
Seleukid influence and spread of Jewish nationa list power, the Hasmonaeans still
operated within a Hellenistic world to which they had adapted rather than one
which they had rejected.
No confrontation of Hellenism and Hebraism disturbed the age of the Maccabees.
Jason as High Priest had introduced the gymnasium and the ephebate. And, so far as
our evidence goes, Judas Maccabaeus, his brothers and their successors kept them in
place. Hasmonaeans and their prominent suppor ters adopted Greek names (a practice
hardly confined to a `Hellenizing par ty'). The purple vestments of the High Priest
represented Seleukid cour t practice. Simon, traditionally claimed as champion of
Jewish autonomy, constr ucted a massive family tomb that imitated Hellenic arche
types and received honou rs through a for mal decree inscribed on bronze tablets that
echoed Greek expressions of gratitude to benefactors. John Hyrkanos inaugurated
the practice of minting coinage in Judaea, with Hellenistic symbols. Alexander
Jannaeu s took matters a step fur ther by spor ting Greek inscriptions on the obverse
of his coins ± while adding Hebrew lettering on the reverse and refraining (as did all
Hasmonaeans) from placing any human por traits on them (Gr uen 1998: 35±7).
Hyrkanos was the first of the Jewish r ulers to hire foreign mercenaries, a pract ice
common to Hellenistic princes ever ywhere, but he and his successors maintained a
majority of nationals in their forces (Jos. AJ 13.249, 13.374±8). And Aristoboulos,
who adopted the diadem and royal title to place him on a footing with Hellenistic
monarchs and styled himself `philhellene', also engaged in nationalist expansionism
and even insisted upon the circumcision of gentiles who had come under his authority
(Jos. AJ 13.318). The Hasmonaeans adver tised their regime as one that absorbed the
Jews and Greeks 269



ways of the Greeks and worked within the traditions of the Jews. Their coinage ser ves
as an appropriate emblem: it spoke in both Greek and Hebrew, but to the same
constituency ± the Jews for whom Hellenism expanded and reinforced their identity.
Internal problems, rather than contests with Greeks, plagued the Jews under the
later Hasmonaeans. Alexander Jannaeus' aggressive campaigns against Arabs and
against coastal cities of Palestine put a heavy strain on Jewish resources, stirring
dissension and rebellion among his own people ± and prompting some br utal retali
ation as a consequence. The degree to which this represents religious resistance by
more traditional elements in society exemplified by the Pharisees remains uncer tain.
Jannaeus' harsh reactions, in any case, seriously exacerbated rifts among the Jews
themselves. They spilled over into the reign of his widow Salome Alexandra and burst
into violent dynastic conflict between her sons Hyrkanos II and Aristoboulos II in the
60s BC
(Schu È rer 1973: 219±36). The fierce hostilities led directly to the most
ominous development for the Jews: the coming of Rome.
A treaty of alliance had held between Rome and the Jews ever since the time of
Judas Maccabaeus. It was twice renewed under Jonathan and Simon, and appealed
to more than once in the High Priesthood of John Hyrkanos I (I
Macc
. 8.20±31,
12.1±4, 14.16±18; Jos.
AJ
13.259±64). But it existed largely as a diplomatic formal
ity, perhaps a source of pride for the Hasmonaeans, never a reason for Roman action
or inter vention. All this changed in the 60s when Pompey led Roman forces in the
East, eliminated the rickety monarchy of the Seleukids, and reduced Syria to the
status of a Roman province. Delegates from the factions of both Hyrkanos II and
Aristoboulos reached Pompey in Syria, with mutual recriminations, and they were
joined by a third set of envoys who denounced both and advocated theocracy without
a king ± the fr uit of continuing internal discontent with the Hasmonaeans. Roman
power decided the issue. Pompey, evidently eager to round of f his successes and
declare a stable situation in the East before his return to Rome, turned against
Aristoboulos, overcame fierce resistance in Jer usalem, captured the citadel, and
even entered the Holy of Holies in the Temple (Schu È rer 1973: 236±42). The events
constituted a fateful turning point for Jewish histor y in the homeland.
Splits among the Jews reflected more than just par tisan rivalries between dynastic
contenders. They involved contests between suppor ters and opponents of the Has
monaeans, between a r ural and an urban populace, and between those willing to
accept foreign r ule and those determined to resist. Pompey's settlement could hardly
resolve all disputes. The general refrained from annexing Judaea as a Roman province.
Indeed, he showed respect for the Temple cult, leaving sacred objects untouched,
ordering the Temple to be cleansed, and even of fering sacrifice to Yahweh ± useful
insurance for his own success in the region. Pompey installed Hyrkanos II as High
Priest, while prohibiting the title of King, and sent Aristoboulos as a captive of f to
Rome. Tribute was imposed upon Jer usalem and the countr yside, perhaps to contrib
ute to the costs of maintaining a Roman administration in Syria, and as a reminder of
Roman presence and influence. And Pompey liberated many cities, including those
on the Mediterranean coast, from the Hasmonaeans (Jos.
AJ
14.72±6;
BJ
1.153±7).
But Rome exercised no direct r ule in Judaea itself. The Jewish religious and political
leadership remained intact. So also did the internal friction and discontent.
Hyrkanos had Roman backing, and retained it for the final thir ty years and more of
his life. He benefited from the Roman civil war in the 40s when first Caesar, then
270
Erich S. Gruen



Caesar's assassins elevated his stature in retur n for loyalty during their conflicts. But
none of this discouraged tumult and upheaval within Hyrkanos' own domain. At least
four times in that period risings occur red against the regime by the family and
suppor ters of Aristoboulos, and each of them gathered considerable numbers before
being suppressed (Schu È rer 1973: 267±80). The episodes disclose sharp discontent
with Hasmonaean r ule, perhaps resentment with Roman overseership, and genuine
nationalist sentiments among the Jews.
In the course of these events, a new leader of remarkable energy, shrewdness and
unscr upulous conduct rose to prominence. The notorious Herod emerged from
Idumaean, rather than Judaean, origins to attain power in Jer usalem and hold it
successfu lly for nearly four decades. Herod attained influence, first through his father,
chief deputy to Hyrkanos, then throug h ingratiating himself with Roman leaders in
the last turbulent years of the Roman Republic. He gained the patronage in tur n of
Sex. Caesar, gover nor of Syria, Cassius, the assassin of Caesar, Mark Antony, Octavian
and Agrippa, managing to land on his feet with each shift in for tunes in Rome. He
succeeded even in obtaining the title of king of Judaea, endorsed in 40 BC
by both
Antony and Octavian before their falling out. And he retained it througho ut his life
(Richardson 1996: 95±130 , 153±73, 262±94). Secular power was now severed from
priestly r ule. More than deft diplomacy operated here. Rome evidently prefer red to
have Judaea as an independent client kingdom than as an appendage to the province
of Syria, thus perhaps as greater counter weight to Egypt. Herod, in any case, took full
advantage. Roman backing allowed him to expand his ter ritorial holdings from
Judaea to Galilee and Peraea, to add Idumaea, Samaria and par ts of Transjordan,
and to acquire key cities on the Mediterranean coast. The execution of Hyrkanos II in
31 BC
ended the Hasmonaean line, giving Herod free rein to appoint his own High
Priests ± which he did with frequency, a sharp diminution of that of fice's authority
and prestige, and fur ther indication that Herod held the whip hand. Not that the
years were trouble-free. Discontent expressed itself more than once in Herod's realm,
and murderous quar rels within his own household mar red his r ule almost throug hout
(Richardson 1996: 216±39). But he held control, exercised extraordinar y power, and
made Judaea a major player in the Near East until his death in 4 BC
.
Herod's links to the classical world were intimate, indeed ostentatiously paraded.
His lavish building program in Palestine and elsewhere announced his passion for
Hellenic cultural traditions. And homage paid to the Roman imperial house through
conspicuous str uctures that rose in his own realm declared Herod's promotion of
Augustan interests. Little wonder that Herod has a tawdr y image in Jewish memor y .
Did the king, in fact, compromise the integrity of Judaism by his commitment to the
world of Greeks and Romans?
It might seem so. Herod authorized the building of a theatre, an amphitheatre and
a hippodrome in Jer usalem itself, striking emblems of classical culture in the ver y
hear t of the nation. Elsewhere he subsidized the constr uction of similar emblems,
including pagan temples and gymnasia, with abandon: in Caesarea, Ptolemais, Jeri
cho, Damascus, Tyre, Sidon and Tripolis. Even more notable, he sponsored the
building of temples to Roma and Augustus, in Caesarea, Sebaste (Samaria) and
Panion, direct homage to the imperial cult (Richardson 1996: 174±215; Roller
1998: 85±213). The king spread his bounty well outside the homeland. He bestowed
benefactions upon a whole ar ray of Greek cities in Asia Minor, the Aegean and Greece
Jews and Greeks 271



Proper. Among other things, he endowed the Olympic Games at Elis and dedicated a
structure in the holy isle of Delos (Roller 1998: 214±38). All of this exhibited the
wealth and generosity of Herod, setting himself in the mould of Hellenistic mon
archs, spreading his patronage and his name, and declaring himself an international
figure at home in the Hellenistic world.
But none of this required diminution of piety toward the ancestral faith. Herod's
most dazzling legacy, in fact, was his rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem in
elaborate and splendid style (Richardson 1996: 245±9). And he had priests them
selves trained as masons and carpenters, so that construction could take place in
proper hands, a clear acknowledgement of sensitivity to traditional feelings (Jos.AJ
15.390, 15.421). Herod indeed made a point of exhibiting his adherence to trad
ition, as in his abstention from pork. Augustus once quipped that he would feel safer
as Herod's pig than as his son (Macrob. Sat. 2.4.11). Shrines to Roma and Augustus
arose only outside Jerusalem, a gesture towards Jewish feelings but also towards
pagans who could conduct their rites with Herod's suppor t. Theatres and hippo
dromes now became established institutions, raising no furor or resistance, Hellenis
tic features that Jews found entirely agreeable without sacrifice of principle. Herod
may have been ruthless toward family and foes and obsessed with shameless self
adver tisement, but his embrace of classical culture was per fectly consistent with the
maintenance of a Jewish heritage.
2 Beyond the Homeland
The encounter of Judaism and Hellenism did not confine itself to Palestine. Jews
spread themselves far and wide in the Mediterranean during the Hellenistic period.
On the information of I Maccabees, composed in the late second centur y B C , they
found their way not only to Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau, but to
the cities and principalities of Asia Minor, to the islands of the Aegean, to Greece itself,
to Crete, Cyprus and Cyrene (I Macc. 15.22±23). Reliable figures elude us. But there
can be little doubt that Jews in the diaspora far outnumbered those in the homeland.
What induced so massive a migration? Some of it, to be sure, was forced and
unwelcome, like the prisoners of war who followed Ptolemy I to Egypt after his
victories in Palestine in the late fourth centur y or the political refugees victimized by
civil strife in the land. But compulsor y dislocation cannot have accounted for more
than a fraction of the diaspora. The vast bulk of Jews who dwelled abroad did so
voluntarily. Even where initial depor tation came under duress, the relocated families
remained in their new residences for generations ± long after the issue of forced
dislocation had become obsolete. Multiple motives operated. Large numbers of Jews
found employment as mercenaries, militar y colonists or enlisted men in the regular
forces. Others seized oppor tunities in business, commerce or agriculture. The new
and expanded communities that sprang up in the wake of Alexander's conquests
ser ved as magnets for migration.
Communal life sustained the Jews of the diaspora. The institutions they created and
the activities they conducted supplied the means to preser ve traditions and advance
the interests of the clan. But they did not promote private enclaves or segregated
seclusion. Jews strove to engender circumstances that would enable them to maintain
their ancient heritage while engaging comfor tably and productively in the classical
272 Erich S. Gruen



lands wherein they dwelled. Even in the diaspora they faced no stark choice between
assimilation or adherence to the faith.
The synagogue was ubiquitous in the Hellenistic era. Testimony is fragmentary but
decisive ± from archaeological, epigraphic, papyrological and literar y sources. Jewish
houses of worship stood in Antioch and Damascus, in Alexandria and Leontopolis, as
well as numerous other sites in Lower and Middle Egypt, in Cyrenaica, in Cyprus, in a
wide range of cities in Asia Minor, on the shores of the Black Sea, in the islands of
Delos, Samos, Kos and Rhodes, at various places in mainland Greece, and as far away
as Italy, where Ostia and even Rome itself housed a substantial Jewish community
(Binder 1999: 227±341; Levine 2000: 74±123; Gruen 2002). It is unlikely that many
Jews in such far-flung locations resorted either to isolationist purity or to outright
apostasy. In Alexandria, for instance, Jews could and did live anywhere in the city. But
the majority chose to make residence in two particular districts that became known as
the Jewish quarters (Philo In Flacc. 55). They mingled freely and (in some cases) lived
among the gentiles, but most preferred the company of their co-religionists. Jews
were not ghettoized. But, at the same time, their identity was undisguised and their
peculiar customs conspicuous. Greek and Latin authors frequently comment on
Jewish embrace of monotheism, obser vance of the Sabbath, dietar y restrictions and
the practice of circumcision (M. Stern 1976; 1980). Attachment to distinctive
traditions continued to mark diaspora existence. And Jews did not have to hide
them away in subterranean regions.
The synagogue provided a setting for a range of ser vices. Jews engaged in a number
of civic and sacral activities that marked their distinctiveness and expressed their
communal identity. A common term for the institution,proseuche, indicates its central
character: a house of prayer. Some of those in Egypt at least even obtained the grant
of asylia, the right of asylum, from the Ptolemies, an acknowledgement of their sacral
nature (CIJ 1449). Manumissions could take place in their precincts, with dedications
to the divinity (Gibson 1999: 127±52). But religious activities constituted only a part
of their role. Study and instruction held a prominent place in the functions of the
synagogue. In the view of Philo, the learned Alexandrian Jew, it qualified as a Jewish
replica of a philosophical academy, the didaskaleion (Philo Mos. 2.216). It supplied a
venue for examination and interpretation of holy writ. Synagogues afforded the
setting for communal dining, particularly for the celebration of festivals, the com
memoration of key events in Jewish tradition that helped to define the community.
They could also serve as places to adjudicate internal disputes among Jews, to
conduct the formal process of manumission, or to assemble for the passage of decrees
or for the meetings of a burial society. Synagogues acted as repositories for sacred
monies, a means for display of votive offerings and dedicatory inscriptions, and
archives for public records (Binder 1999: 389±450; Levine 2000: 124±59; Gruen
2002). Not that all these functions were performed in all synagogues. Local circum
stances doubtless dictated numerous divergences. But the range of activities is
impressive and telling. They were not carried out in secret enclaves. Synagogues
stood in public view, sabbath observances were well known to gentiles, inscriptions
announced decisions of the congregation, and the collection of moneys and their
shipment to Jerusalem were conspicuous. The testimony underscores thriving and
vigorous Jewish communities, self-assured in the exhibit of their traditions and the
fostering of their special character.
Jews and Greeks 273



The mechanisms for internal stability seem clear. But to what degree did Jews move
outside their own circles and participate (or were permitted to participate) actively in
the wider affairs of the Greek world in which they dwelled? Evidence here is scantier
but not insignificant.
The best testimony comes from Egypt. It suggests that Jews in the Ptolemaic era
fared surprisingly well. The author of the Letter of Aristeas, an Alexandrian Jew
writing in Greek, reports that Ptolemy I removed up to 100,000 Jews from Palestine
to Egypt, and then installed 30,000 of them in garrisons and fortresses throughout
his realm (12±13, 35±6). The numbers are inflated and incredible. But the fact of
Jewish soldiers serving in the Ptolemaic armies need not be doubted. Ample evidence,
literary, epigraphic and papyrological, attests to it. Jews enrolled in regular units of
the army, could obtain officer rank, and received land grants like any others in the lists
of the royal forces (CPJ 18±32). Inscriptions in Aramaic and Greek from Alexandrian
cemeteries in the early Ptolemaic period disclose Jews, evidently mercenary soldiers,
buried alongside Greeks from all parts of the Hellenic world (CIJ 1424±31). One
need not credit Josephos when he claims that Ptolemy VI appointed two Jewish
officers as generals over the entire army, particularly when he makes the identical
claim for Kleopatra III a generation later (Jos. Ap. 2.49; AJ 13.285±7, 13.349).
Nevertheless, a substantial Jewish element plainly existed in the armed forces of the
Ptolemaic domain. Jews, in fact, can be found at various levels of the Hellenistic
administration in Egypt, as tax-farmers and tax-collectors, as bankers and granary
officials (Kasher 1985: 58±63). No barriers, it appears, existed to prevent their
engagement in the social and economic world of Ptolemaic Egypt. By the time of
the early Roman principate (and doubtless earlier) the Jews in that land were shop
owners, farmers, merchants, shippers, traders and artisans. They even turn up as
policemen (Kasher 1985: 55±8).
The gymnasium marked the capstone of higher education in Greek cities all around
the Mediterranean and beyond. That institution, with its attendant corps of ephebes,
the select youth of upper echelon families, signalled the cultural and intellectual elite
of the Hellenistic world. Blanket statements about Jewish participation are impossible
in view of the slim testimony. But there is enough to show that they did take part at
least in some cities. Lists of ephebes, for instance, from Cyrene and from the Karian
city of Iasos include unmistakable Jewish names (SEG 20.740±1; Robert 1946:
90±108). The effect of gymnasium education upon Jews cannot be gainsaid. Jewish
authors adapted the Greek language and Greek literary genres to rewrite biblical
stories, to produce historical narratives and to create fictional fantasies. They include
the translators of the Pentateuch into Greek, the historian Demetrios, the authors of
historical fiction like The Letter of Aristeas and III Maccabees, the tragedian Ezekiel,
Aristoboulos the philosophic writer and supposed teacher of Ptolemy VI, and the
wildly inventive Artapanos who recast tales from Genesis and Exodus to his own
peculiar mold (Gruen 1998: 110±60; Collins 2000: 29±46, 186±95, 224±30). The
anticipated readership of these authors must have been largely Jewish. Diaspora
communities, scattered in the eastern Mediterranean, were predominantly Greek
speaking, their knowledge of the Bible dependent upon the Septuagint, with most
of their numbers no longer conversant with Hebrew. But the composers of these
works plainly had access to higher education and to Hellenic cultural traditions.
274 Erich S. Gruen



Those who mastered Hellenic literar y genres and wrote in elegant Greek must have
had gymnasium education or its equivalent.
Diaspora Jews were no strangers to the athletic activities associated with Greek
gymnasia. The evidence of the Alexandrian Philo makes this clear. He discourses
knowledgeably about both the subtle tactics and the brutality of boxers, the fierce and
draining battles of the pancratiasts, the tremendous powers of endurance exhibited by
wrestlers, the pitfalls encountered by sprinters and jumpers, and the rabid spectators
at chariot races, some of whom rushed out onto the race-course and were crushed by
the vehicles. In addition, his works frequently made use of the imager y of athletic
contests and physical training for purposes of analogy and simile (H. Harris 1976:
55±70). Philo clearly took for granted that his readers, primarily Jews, had a close
acquaintance with them. Nor did Jewish fascination with and par ticipation in gym
nasia confine itself to the diaspora. Herod built three gymnasia (at least) in Palestine
(Jos. AJ 15.268±271, 15.341, 17.194).
Jews, it appears, could even share in the governing process of gentile cities.
Whether or not they held citizenship in individual communities (or indeed desired
it) remains unclear. But the Jews of Alexandria cer tainly par took of political privileges
and freely termed themselves `Alexandrians' (Philo In Flacc. 53; Jos. AJ 14.188).
They possessed similar status in Antioch, and in several cities of Asia Minor (Jos.AJ
12.119, 14.235; BJ 7.44). And they were able to attain high of fice in Cyrene
(Applebaum 1979: 186±9). If more evidence were available, we might indeed find
them elsewhere as well. Cer tainly the Jewish communities in Rome contained a
substantial number who had even acquired Roman citizenship (Philo Leg. 157±8) ±
and others who held that franchise in Hellenistic cities abroad (like Paul of Tarsos).
No barriers excluded Jews from becoming full-fledged beneficiaries of Roman imper
ial power. Of course, this does not translate into untroubled existence ever ywhere and
all the time. But diaspora existence, insofar as we can make it out, managed to
combine access to the classical world with af firmation of a traditional identity.
It remains to ask what relations held between Jews in the diaspora and those in the
homeland and what role Jerusalem played in the self-perception of Jews abroad. The
Temple still stood, a reminder of the hallowed past, and a Jewish regime existed in
Palestine. Yet those in the diaspora, from Italy to Iran, constituted the vast bulk of
Hellenistic Jewr y. Few of them had ever seen Jerusalem, and few were likely to. Had
Jerusalem then lost its significance for Jews long since settled in the communities of
the Hellenistic world?
Far from it. The sanctity of Jerusalem retained a central place in the consciousness
of Hellenistic Jews, wherever they happened to reside. References to Palestine as `the
holy land' and Jerusalem as the `holy city' occur frequently in diaspora writings (e.g.
II Macc. 1.12; Philo Leg. 225). And even the pagan geographer Strabo takes note of
Jewish devotion to their sacred `acropolis' (16.2.37). Loyalty to one's native land was
a deep commitment in the rhetoric of the Hellenistic world. Jews naturally adopted a
similar stance. Philo more than once endorsed the idea that adherence to one'spatris
has compelling power. For that philosopher, neglect of the patris stands on a level
with failure to worship God (Philo Mos. 2.198). Other Jewish writers produced
comparable formulations. Jerusalem as concept and reality remained a power ful
emblem of Jewish identity, in no way disavowed by those who dwelled afar.
Jews and Greeks 275



Do such pronouncements suggest discontent in the diaspora, a desire to pull up
stakes and return to the fatherland (see van Unnik 1993)? That inference would be
erroneous. Asser tions about love of one's countr y accord with general Hellenistic
attitudes and expressions (e.g. Polyb. 1.14.4). They do not require that residence
abroad be abandoned and native environs reinhabited lest life remain unfulfilled. It is
noteworthy that the texts which speak of reverence for thepatris make no mention of
the `Return' as a goal. Jewish settlements abroad were often characterized asapoikiai,
`colonies' (e.g. III Macc. 6.10; Philo Mos. 1.71, 2.232). That designation presented
them as of fshoots from the metropolis. But the term, in customar y Greek usage,
lacked negative over tones. And, as employed by Jewish writers, its implications were,
in fact, decidedly positive. Philo proudly details the `colonies' that had been sent out
from Judaea over the years to places all over the Mediterranean and the Near East
(Leg. 281±2). Josephos echoes that sentiment in asser ting that Jewish par ticipation in
colonies dispatched by other nations gave them an honoured presence in those
settlements from the star t (Ap. 2.38). Philo indeed af firms that for those sent to a
colony, the apoikia, rather than the metropolis, becomes the patris (Conf.Ling. 78).
Jerusalem, in shor t, remained the mother city. But, as is clear, the expression `colony'
had a ring of pride and accomplishment, signalling the spread of the faith and its
adherents, not a fall from grace. Philo elsewhere of fers a striking depiction of Jewish
attitudes both towards Jerusalem and towards the lands where they now (and for
generations) had made their home. As he puts it, they considered the holy city as their
metropolis, but the states in which they were born and raised and which they acquired
from their fathers, grandfathers and distant forefathers they adjudged their patrides
(In Flacc. 46). That fer vent expression eradicates any `doctrine of the Return'.
Diaspora Jews, in Philo's formulation, held a fierce attachment to the adopted
lands of their ancestors.
Jews around the Mediterranean appear unapologetic and unembarrassed by their
situation. They did not describe themselves as par t of a diaspora. They did not suggest
that they were cut of f from the centre, leading a separate, fragmented and limited
existence. People from communities and nations ever ywhere settled outside their
places of origin in the fluid and mobile Hellenistic world without abandoning their
identities as Athenians, Macedonians, Phoenicians, Antiochenes or Egyptians. The
Jews equally eschewed justification, rationalization, or tor tured explanation for their
choice of residence. They felt no need to construct a theor y of diaspora.
Commitment to the local community and devotion to Jerusalem were entirely
compatible. That devotion had a public and conspicuous demonstration ever y year:
the payment of a tithe to the Temple from Jews all over the Mediterranean. The
ritualistic of fering carried deep significance as a bonding device. The fact impressed
itself notably upon the Romans. When the Roman senate in the 60sB C passed a series
of decrees forbidding the expor t of gold, they had not reckoned with this Jewish
institution. A howl of protest arose. The episode, as disclosed in a speech of Cicero,
no fan of the Jews, demonstrates the earnest obligation of Jews ever ywhere to provide
funds annually to the Temple from Italy and from all provinces of the Roman empire.
Cicero remarks both on the pressure and the size of the Jewish assemblage in Rome
that had gathered to suppor t their compatriots elsewhere (Cic. Flac. 66±8). The
event exhibits the solidarity of sentiments among diaspora Jews from Italy to the Near
East in the matter of expressing their allegiance to Jerusalem. Philo reinforces the
276 Erich S. Gruen



testimony of Cicero. His comment on the large Jewish community in Rome at the
time of Augustus also associates it with zeal for gathering the sacred tithes to be
delivered by envoys to Jerusalem ± a fact well known to the princeps (Leg. 155±6).
The stark symbolism of the tithe had a potent hold upon Jewish sentiment. The
repeated, ritualistic contributions emblematized the unbroken attachment of the
diaspora to the centre.
Did the outpouring of cash for the Temple by Jews from Italy to Iran imply that the
diaspora was reckoned as fleeting and temporar y, an interim exile or refuge, an
af fliction to be endured until restoration to the Holy Land? In fact, the reverse
conclusion holds. The continuing pledge of allegiance proclaimed that the diaspora
could endure indefinitely and quite satisfactorily. The communities abroad were
entrenched and successful, even mainstays of the centre. Their fierce commitment
to the tithe did not signify a desire for the Return. To the contrar y. It signalled that
the Return was unnecessar y.
A comparable phenomenon confirms the conclusion: the pilgrimage of diaspora
Jews to Jerusalem (Safrai and Stern 1974: 191±204). Major festivals could attract
them with some frequency, and in quantity. Huge crowds from abroad at Passover
were evidently common. The women's court at the Temple was large enough to
accommodate those who resided in the land and those who came from abroad ± a
clear sign that female pilgrims in some numbers were expected visitors (Jos. BJ
5.199). The deliver y of the annual tithe itself brought diaspora Jews to Jerusalem
on a regular basis, a ritual per formance analogous to, even identical with a pilgrimage.
The visits to the homeland and gifts to the Temple followed the appropriate mode of
expressing homage. But the demonstration of devotion did not entail a desire for
migration. Pilgrimage, in fact, by its ver y nature, signified a temporar y payment of
respect. The holy city had an irresistible and undiminished claim on the emotions of
diaspora Jews. It was indeed a critical piece of their identity. But home was elsewhere.
The self-perception of Hellenistic Jews projected a tight solidarity between centre
and diaspora. The connection emerges with impressive frequency in both fictitious
representations and historical events. The author of II Maccabees, for example,
provides a letter from the Jews of Jerusalem to their brethren in Egypt, urging
them to celebrate the new festival that honoured the recover y and purification of
the temple after the desecration by Antiochos IV (II Macc. 1.9, 1.18, 2.16±17). The
Letter of Aristeas, celebrating the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, has
King Ptolemy II write to the High Priest in Judaea, asser ting that the purpose of the
translation was to benefit not only the Jews of Egypt but all Jews throughout the
world ± even those not yet born (38).
The community of interests could have direct ef fect on the events of Jewish histor y.
In the late second centur y B C , Kleopatra III, Queen of Egypt, contemplated an
invasion of Judaea, but was dissuaded by the advice of a Jewish general in her army.
He claimed that any attack on the High Priest and his land would make enemies of all
the Jews in Egypt. Kleopatra prudently dropped the idea (Jos.AJ 14.127±37). A half
centur y later, when Julius Caesar was besieged in Alexandria, a troop of three
thousand Jewish soldiers marched to his rescue from Palestine. A hostile group of
Egyptian Jews dwelling in Leontopolis temporarily blocked their path until their
general brandished a letter from the High Priest in Jerusalem. No further persuasion
was necessar y. The Jews of both Lentopolis and of Memphis declared themselves for
Jews and Greeks 277



Caesar and helped to tur n the tide of war (Jos.
AJ
17.300±1). The sense of Jewish
solidarity and the respect for the High Priest's authority had an impressive impact.
Other episodes of fer similar illustrations. Fifty envoys came from Judaea to Rome in 4
BC
after the death of Herod the Great, pressing Augustus for an end to Herodian r ule.
Eight thousand Jews in Rome immediately materialized to suppor t their lobbying
ef for ts. And when a pretender to the throne emerged, claiming to be a reincar nation
of one of Herod's sons, he found widespread backing from Jews in Crete, in Melos
and in Rome itself (Jos.
AJ
17.321±8). These events provide a revealing window
upon the lively interest and occasionally energetic engagement of diaspora Jews in the
af fairs of Palestine.
A moving passag e in Philo's corpus neatly encapsulates the theme. Philo who
thrived in the diaspora, enjoyed its advantages, and broadcast its vir tues, never theless
found even deeper meaning in the land of Israel. In his discussion of Jewish festivals,
he interprets Pentecost as a celebration of the Jews' possession of their own land, a
heritage now of long standing, and a means whereby they could ease their wandering
over continents and islands and their existence as foreigners and vagabonds dwelling
in the countries of others (
Spec.Leg
. 2.168). Philo saw no incons istency or contradic
tion. Diaspora Jews might find fulfilment and reward in their comm unities abroad, as
he himself did. But they honoured Judaea as refuge for the for merly displaced and
unsettled, and the prime legacy of all.
Josephos makes the point in a quite dif ferent context but with equal force. In his
rewriting of the biblical Book of Numbers, he places a sweeping prognostication in
the mouth of the Midianite priest Balaam. To the conster nation of the king of Moab
who had expected a dark oracle for the Israelites, Balaam predicted a glorious future.
They will not only occupy and hold forever the land of Canaan, a chief signal of God's
favour, but their multitudes will fill all the world, islands and continents, outnumber
ing even the stars in the heavens (
AJ
4.115±6). That is a notable declaration.
Palestine, as ever, merits a special place. But the diaspora, far from being a source
of shame to be overcome, represents a resplendent achievement.
The respect and awe paid to the Holy Land stood in full har mony with commit
ment to local community and allegiance to gentile gover nance. Diaspora Jews did not
bewail their fate and pine away for the homeland. Palestine mattered, and it mattered
in a ter ritorial sense. But not as a required residence. Gifts to the Temple and
pilgrimages to Jer usalem announced simultaneously a devotion to the symbolic
hear t of Judaism and a singular pride in the accomplishments of the diaspora. Jewish
Hellenistic writers took the concur rence for granted. They were not driven to apolo
gia. Nor did they feel obliged to reconcile the contradiction. There was none.

The pivotal work on the relationship between Judaism and Hellenistic culture in
this era is that of Hengel 1974 which made a power ful case for the early and extensive
infiltration of Hellenism into Palestine. The subject of Jewish-Hellenistic literature as
emblematic of that cultural interchange has received recent discussion in Gruen 1998
and Collins 2000.
The topic of Jewish life outside Palestine, in the diaspora, is explored in a broad
gauged, extensive and judicious work by Barclay 1996. A dif ferent approach can be
found now in Gruen 2002. More detailed studies pursue this topic in par ticular
regions of the Mediterranean: On Cyrene, Applebaum 1979; on Egypt, Kasher
1985, M Â ele Á ze-Modrzejewski 1995; on Asia Minor, Trebilco 1991. Two major
sur veys of the role of the synagogue in the promotion of Jewish identity in both
Palestine and the diaspora have appeared ver y recently: Binder 1999 and Levine
2000. On the attitudes of Greeks toward the Jews in their midst, the invaluable
collection by M. Stern,

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
The Galatians:
Representation and Reality
Stephen Mitchell
During the later months of 280 B C well organized bands of Celtic warriors gathered
in the southern Balkans, poised to invade first Greece, in 279, and then Asia Minor in
the following year (Mitchell 1993: I.13±15; Strobel 1996; figure 17.1). These incur
sions and the subsequent settlement of Celtic peoples in central Asia Minor, in the
region which was known thereafter as Galatia, were episodes of far reaching impor t
ance in the formation of the Hellenistic world. Greek writers used the name Galatai to
refer both to the Celtic peoples of Gaul and to the Celts of Asia Minor, and the latter
were also known as Gallograeci to Latin authors. In modern terminology the term
Galatians is applied exclusively to denote the Celtic peoples of the eastern Balkans and
especially of Asia Minor.
1 The Attack on Greece in 279
The fullest sur viving account of the Galatian invasion of Greece, and the key text for
our understanding of the impact of the newcomers, was written by Pausanias in the
third quar ter of the second centur y A D . He was in no doubt as to the significance of
these events:
My description of the council chamber at Athens contains some obser vations on the
Galatian expedition into Greece. I wanted to provide a clearer record of them in my
account of Delphi, because these were the greatest of all the deeds which the Greeks
accomplished against the barbarians. (10.12.5; referring back to 1.4.1±6)
The narrative which follows this introduction is derived from an excellent early
Hellenistic source, perhaps the historian Hieronymos of Kardia, and is one of
the longest of Pausanias' invaluable excursuses on Hellenistic histor y (Habicht 1985:
95±117; Ameling 1994). He saw the Galatian war as a prime illustration of how the
Greeks could act collectively in defence of their most prized possession, their free
dom. After the Persian War of 480/79, he set the repulse of the Galatians alongside
Greek resistance to the Macedonian power of Philip at Chaironeia in 338 and of

Antipater during the Lamian war of 322, as true tests of this patriotic panhellenic
spirit (Habicht 1985: 106±7).
The invasion of Greece during the winter of 279/8 focused on the heroic but
unsuccessful defence of Thermopylai, and a decisive battle at Delphi. The Greeks
recalled that Apollo's divine inter vention had combined with the forces of nature, a
violent winter storm, to aid the defenders, and contributed to the total extirpation of
the Galatian forces (Bearzot 1989). In practice, the key militar y contribution to the
defence of Delphi came from the Aitolians, who thereafter took control of the
Amphiktyonic League which ran the sanctuar y (Nachtergael 1977). Pausanias expli
citly highlighted the parallels between the defence of Greece in 279 and Herodotos'
account of the Persian invasion two centuries earlier (Ameling 1994: 145±58). He
matched the catalogues of Greek allies on each occasion with one another (10.20.1±5)
and compared the Galatian battle unit known as the trimarkisia, in which the
unmounted attendants of each cavalr yman replaced their master if he fell, with
the Persian `immor tals' of Xerxes' army (10.19.10±11). In the same spirit he recalled
the deeds of the fallen Athenian warrior Kydias, by quoting his inscribed memorial
dedicated to Zeus Eleutherios (10.21.5). The Athenians, under the command of
Kallippos, who led the Greek forces at Thermopylai in 279, were fully the equal of
their Spar tan counterpar ts in the struggle with the Persians (1.4; cf. 7.15.3), and
indeed the Greek achievement as a whole even exceeded the earlier one, as the
The Galatians: Representation and Reality 281



struggle was not merely for their freedom, but for their ver y existence against the
merciless barbarian foe (10.19.12).
The comparison of the two invasions was no invention of Pausanias but had been a
commonplace of Hellenistic historiography. Polybios' account of Roman campaigns
against the Celts in nor thern Italy compared those events with Greek resistance to the
Persian and Galatian invasions. He claimed that such written accounts of heroic
resistance to the barbarians made no mean contribution to the defence of the
common good of the Greeks and to the struggles which continued against the
Galatians in Asia Minor until Polybios' own times (Polyb. 2.35.7±9). Propaganda
and historical myth-making were as impor tant to the Greek cause as arms, leadership
and manpower.
Most of the contemporar y descriptions of these struggles, like so much Hellenistic
historical writing, are now lost, but inscriptions, sculptures and other monuments
from the third and second centuries indicate that the myth of the defence of Delphi
and Greece, and the comparison with the Persian invasion, were created in the
immediate aftermath of the conflict. In the spring or early summer of 278 the people
of Kos passed a resolution to send a delegation to attend the new festival, which had
been founded to celebrate the saving of Delphi, and to sacrifice in their own city to
Pythian Apollo, to Zeus the saviour, and to Victor y. The preamble runs:
Diokles son of Philinos proposed: since, when the barbarians had made an expedition
against the Greeks and against the sanctuar y at Delphi, it has been repor ted that those
who attacked the sanctuar y had encountered vengeance from the god and from the men
who had come to the aid of the sanctuar y on the occasion of the barbarian invasion, and
the temple had been protected and adorned with the shields of the attackers, and that
most of the remaining fighting men had perished in the battles with the Greeks; ± so that
the people (of Kos) may demonstrate its joy at the victor y and give thanks to the god
both for his appearance at the moment of the sanctuar y's peril and for the safety of the
Greeks: ± it was resolved . . . (SIG 3 398; trans BD 17)
Three themes were emphasized in the Delphic propaganda, which was immediately
adopted across the Greek world: the gods' divine protection, Greek unity in defence
of the sanctuar y and the overriding theme of salvation, identified in the name of the
new festival, the Sote Ãria. The Aitolians, who made immediate political capital from
their decisive contribution, at once set their own deeds on a level with those of the
Athenians during the Persian invasion. Pausanias, who had seen them, tells us that the
shields mentioned in the Koan decree had been placed by the Aitolians in the metopes
of the west and south sides of the temple of Apollo to complement the gilded shields
set up on the east and nor th by the Athenians after the battle of Marathon (Paus.
1019.3; Schalles 1985: 107).
Later writers, as well as contemporar y inscriptions, laid enormous stress on the
cruelty and savager y of these new barbarians. Plunder, rape and wanton murder were
claimed to be their stock in trade, and horrific stories were told about how they
treated their enemies:
They butchered ever y human male of that entire race, the old men and the children at the
breast; and the Gauls drank the blood and ate the flesh of the slaughtered babie s . . . Any
woman and mature virgins with a spark of pride committed suicide as soon as the city fell;
282 Stephen Mitchell



those who lived were subjected with wanton violence to ever y form of outrage by men as
remote from mercy as they were remote from love. . . . Others were to die by famishing
hunger and sleeplessness, outraged in an endless succession by pitiless and barbarous
men: they mated with the dying; they mated with the already dead. (Paus. 10.22.2)
This description of the atrocities inflicted on the Kallieans in Thessaly, with its
hysterical crescendo rising from butcher y, cannibalism and gang rape to necrophilia,
is the most extreme example of the demonization of the Galatians, but the grotesque
exaggeration carries little historical conviction. No doubt conflicts were brutal and
violent, but the evidence of contemporar y Asia Minor inscriptions from Thyateira
(
TAM 5.2.881), Er ythrai (SIG
3 410) and two villages of the L ykos valley (I.Laodikeia
I.1, trans. Burstein 19) indicates that the Galatians, rather than slaughter their
victims, preferred to take captives with the aim of obtaining ransom payments, or
held hostages to secure the compliance of Greek communities that opposed them.
2 The Crossing to Asia in 278
The militar y threat of the Galatians passed from Greece to Asia Minor, as the tribes of
the Tolistobogii (or Tolistoagii), Trocmi and Tectosages crossed the Hellespont and
the Bosporus in the winter months of 278/7 (Just. 25.2.7). The terror which they
instilled in the cities of western Asia Minor is documented in a series of inscriptions
from the 270s, before they were ef fectively confined to their permanent settlements
in central Anatolia (Mitchell 1993: I.15±18). The responsibility and the credit for
crushing the threat now passed from the Aitolians and the cities of Greece to the
Hellenistic kings. Within a decade the dynasties of the Antigonids, the Seleukids and
the Ptolemies each stridently claimed that it had rescued the Greeks from the new
barbarian enemy and made this feat the basis of its own claims to legitimate rulership.
In 277 Antigonos Gonatas defeated an army of 15,000 Celts at L ysimacheia on the
European shore of the Hellespont and assumed the title So Ã te Ã r (saviour) for the first
time. He thus sealed his claim to the kingship of Macedonia. Sometime between 275
and 268 Antiochos I rendered a similar ser vice to the communities of western Asia
Minor by defeating a Galatian army at the so-called `Battle of the Elephants'. The
echoes of this victor y resonated widely. The terracotta workshops of Myrina near
Pergamon produced figurines depicting elephants trampling Galatian warriors. These
were doubtless modelled on the trophy, depicting only an elephant, which Antiochos
had erected after the battle (Bienkowski 1928: 141±50). The literar y traditions
surrounding the event lie behind a brief, but epic description of the battle in Lucian's
shor t essay Zeuxis. Appian tells us that Antiochos was first called So Ã te Ã r after the battle
(
Syr . 65) and the title first appears on inscriptions of the 260s. Even in Egypt Ptolemy
II was able to exploit a triumph over the Gauls to enhance his own monarchic
prestige. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Delos, and other poets compared the crushing
of a mutiny of 4000 Celtic mercenaries on an island in the river Nile with the victor y
of the gods over the giants and with Apollo's recent triumph at Delphi (Strobel 1994:
78±9). Galatian shields were depicted in the decoration of the temple of the Ptolemaic
ruler cult at Limyra in Asia Minor.
A generation later Attalos I of Pergamon constructed his own monarchy on exactly
the same foundations. Polybios tells us that Attalos only received the title of king after
The Galatian s: Representation and Reality 283



his victor y over the Galatians, forty-four years before his death in 197 B C (Polyb.
18.41.7). He will have claimed the title So Ãte Ãr at the same time. This takes us back to
around 240, the context of his victories first over the Galatian tribe of the Tolistobogii
in a battle fought in Mysia at the sources of the river Kaikos and then over the
Galatians fighting in alliance with the Seleukid Antiochos Hierax (Mitchell 1993:
I.21±2; for translations of the inscriptions of the victor y monument, Burstein 85).
The claim that victor y over barbarian, and especially Galatian forces, elevated the
Hellenistic kings to be the saviours of the Greeks continued to be a crucial theme of
royal propaganda in the second centur y, as is clear from an inscription of Telmessos in
L ykia, set up in honour of Eumenes II in 184 to celebrate his victories over the
Bithynian king Prusias and his Galatian allies.
King Eumenes, our saviour and benefactor, took up the war not only on behalf of his
own subjects but also on behalf of the other inhabitants of Asia, and surmounted the
danger; having summoned the gods to his assistance and struggled against Prusias and
Or tiagon and the Galatians and their allies, he triumphed brilliantly and splendidly and
so as to make us give thanks to the gods. (Rober t 1934: 284±6)
3 The Saviours of Civilization
The ideology of salvation was a vital feature in the legitimization of the Hellenistic
monarchies. During the for ty-five years which separated the death of Alexander the
Great in 323 from the Galatian attack on Delphi in 279/8 Alexander's Macedonian
successors had fought with one another to control his empire but had established no
claims to be legitimate rulers of the Greeks. As Pausanias shows better than any other
ancient writer, their authority was bitterly resented by the independent cities of
Greece and Asia Minor. Alexander asser ted that he had fought to free the Greeks of
Asia from the Persians, but his mission had been betrayed by his successors. The
appearance of the Galatians was thus providential for the next generation of rulers.
The Celtic intruders had been identified by the Greeks themselves as an external
threat comparable to the Persians. Without exception the major Hellenistic monarch
ies used their own Galatian victories to argue that they had saved the Greeks from the
new barbarian peril and thus to justify their own right to rule.
Architecture and sculpture were exploited in spectacular fashion to promote the
myth of the kings as saviours of the Greeks. The victories over the Galatians in
par ticular became the cornerstone of the programme of the Attalids to promote
themselves as the dominant power in Asia Minor and the Aegean world through
paintings, sculptures and building programmes. Their impact can be seen in the
major centres of the Greek world: Delphi, Athens, Delos, and naturally at their
own capital Pergamon.
The aspirations of the Attalid kings are visibly embodied in the buildings of the
sanctuar y of Athena on the acropolis of Pergamon (Schalles 1985: 51±104; Radt
1999). The temple itself was a relatively modest Doric building, probably founded by
Barsine, a Persian mistress of Alexander the Great, between 330 and 325 B C . At an
early date the cult was identified as that of Athena Polias, reflecting the close link
between Pergamon and Athens, whose cultural and political leadership would be

of the Gal atians, the figure of the Dying Gaul (figur e 17.2 ) and the group depicting a
Galati an chieft ain in the act of plunging his sword into his own br east whi le suppor t
ing the slum ped body o f his slain wife , both known in fine marble copies of the
Roman impe rial period, were displayed on this base, a s par t of a progr amme dep icting
the king's defea ted foes (for an alter native recons tr ucti on of the bas e, Mars zal 2000:
figur e 10.1 ). It is clear that the choice of sculptura l subjec ts, which includ ed
oriental as well as nor ther n barbarians, was designe d to represen t Attalos not as the
The Galatian s: Representation an d Reality 285



victor over his Seleukid rivals in Asia Minor, but as the conqueror of barbarian forces
that threatened Greek civilization.
The symbolic impor tance of victor y over the Galatians was emphatically reinforced
when the sanctuar y was enlarged and remodelled by Eumenes II (193±159). The area
around the temple was enclosed by two-storey stoas erected to the nor th, east and
south. The balustrades in the upper storey of the nor th and east stoas and those of the
new propylon carried friezes depicting Galatian weapons, most distinctively their
large oval shields with spindle-shaped bosses. Architectural sculpture was cer tainly
also complemented by paintings, which have not sur vived. Pausanias mentions that
he had seen a painting depicting a battle against Galatians on the Pergamene acropolis
(1.4.6). Eumenes himself fought major campaigns against the Galatians in 184/3 and
168±6. His final victor y, at a battle in Phr ygia, was hailed with jubilation by the cities
of western Asia Minor, and celebrated with new festivals founded in his honour
(OGIS 305, 763, trans. Burstein 88). Fragments of a frieze found at Ephesos depict
a battle with Galatians, which is probably to be associated with one of these wars. At
Pergamon itself Eumenes now under took the last great building operation of the
dynasty on the Pergamene acropolis, the construction of the Great Altar, a work
which defined the cultural and political claims of Pergamon as surely as the Par thenon
had done for Athens. The main frieze took a mythological subject, the wars of the
gods and the giants, the cosmic counterpar ts of the Greeks' ear thly enemies, but the
latter were represented iconographically in the guise of nor thern barbarians, with
their thick manes of unkempt hair and full beards, an unmistakable allusion to the
Galatians (Strobel 1991: 110±11). Thus the victories over barbarian foes were
harnessed to the key aims of Pergamene propaganda, to present the Attalid regime
as proponents of civilization and culture against the forces of barbarian disorder and
as saviours and protectors of the Greeks from the Galatian threat.
The message was spread by vigorous cultural imperialism, focusing on the most
impor tant sanctuaries and cities of Greece. The earliest Attalid monuments outside
Pergamon appear to have been built at the sanctuar y of Apollo on the island of Delos.
At either end of the south por tico, which stood on the east side of the processional
way to the temple, stood two large statue bases, ver y similar in dimensions to those
set up in honour of Attalos I at Pergamon, whose subjects were, respectively, Attalos
in battle with the Galatians, and his general Epigenes, depicted on horseback ( IG
11.4.1109±10). They should be dated to the period 228±23 (Schalles 1985: 60±8).
Sculptures depicting Galatians have also been found on Delos, although none can be
demonstrably linked to the south por tico. It is likely, but not proven, that the
victories over the Galatians were commemorated in similar fashion at Delphi. Attalos
I was cer tainly responsible for building a stoa above a new terrace in the nor th-west
par t of the sanctuar y, in front of which stood one or more statue bases carr ying his
dedications. Unfor tunately there is no direct evidence for the choice of subjects for
the sculptures, and the building is better dated around 210/9, when Attalos received
the honorar y post of general in the Aitolian League, than to the immediate aftermath
of his victories in the late 220s (Ameling in Bringmann and von Steuben 1995:
143±50). However, the design of the terrace and its stoa was closely modelled on a
similar structure which the Aitolians had built on the opposite side of the sanctuar y
and adorned with spoils and other reminiscences of their defeat of the Gauls in 279,
and it is unlikely that the Attalid building failed to highlight the same theme. Both
286 Stephen Mitchell



structures with their decorative programmes also deliberately recalled predecessors
built in the fifth centur y to commemorate Greek victories over the Persians (Schalles
1985: 104±23).
Pausanias is once again our only written source for a monument erected by a
Pergamene king on the acropolis of Athens:
Next to the south wall Attalos set up a monument depicting the legendar y war of the
giants, who once lived around Thrace and on the isthmus of Pallene, the battle of the
Athenians against the Amazons, the struggle at Marathon against the Persians and the
defeat of the Galatians in Mysia. Ever y figure was two cubits high. (1.25.2)
Marble sculptures from Rome, known as the small Galatian monuments to distin
guish them from those of Attalos I at Pergamon itself, depicting giants, amazons,
Persians and Galatians, have been identified as copies derived from this dedication,
and their style suggests that the originals probably date to the period of Attalos II
(159±53) rather than Attalos I. The composition vividly illustrates the whole thrust of
Pergamene cultural propaganda, which deliberately assimilated their victories over
the Galatians with the mythological defeat of the giants by the gods, of the Amazons
by the Athenians, and with Athens' historical triumph over the Persians in 490 (see
also Kosmetatou, this volume, section 3; Stewar t, this volume, section 2).
The Galatians thus provided the Hellenistic world with a new barbarian model to
replace that of the Persians of the fifth and four th centuries. Just as the identity of
Classical Greece in impor tant ways had been shaped in self-conscious reaction to the
image of the oriental barbarian, so the hellenized world after Alexander, which
stretched far across former Persian territor y, found its own identity in the contrast
with the new type of the nor thern barbarian, embodied by the Galatian invaders. The
Macedonian dynasties, whose arbitrar y authority was deeply of fensive to most Greek
cities, now justified their claims to rule by of fering protection to their subjects from
the new enemies.
4 Historical Realities
The historical reality of Galatian histor y and culture as it entered into contact with the
hellenized world bore little resemblance to the way they were represented by their
enemies. A perspective that comes much closer to this reality than those of the
propagandist sources reviewed so far is provided by the local historian, Memnon of
Herakleia, who describes how the newcomers were brought across to Asia after they
had been exer ting pressure on the last city of Europe, Byzantion:
(Nikomedes, king of Bithynia) arranged to bring them across on friendly terms. The
terms were: the barbarians would always maintain a friendly attitude toward Nikomedes
and his descendants, and without the approval of Nikomedes they would ally with none
of those who sent embassies to them, but they would be friends with his friends and
enemies to those who were not his friends; and also they would ally with the Byzantines,
if by chance there were need, and with the Tians and the Herakleotes and the Chalk
edonians and the citizens of Kieros and with some other rulers of peoples. On these
terms Nikomedes brought the Galatian hordes into Asia. There were seventeen promin
ent leaders, and of these the most eminent and chief were Leonnorios and Luturios. At
The Galatians: Representation and Reality 287



first the crossing of the Galatians to Asia was believed to have led to harm for the
inhabitants, but the result proved it to have been to their advantage. For, while the
(Seleukid) kings were eager to deprive the cities of democracy, the Galatians especially
secured it by opposing those attacking it. (Memnon FGrH 434 F11; trans. Burstein 16,
modified)
The first implication of this passage is that the Galatians, far from being a tumultuous
horde, were disciplined warrior bands with responsible and ef fective leaders. This
impression, which is also implicit in Pausanias' account of the invasion of Greece, is
fully borne out by detailed analysis of the social organization of the successful and
aggressive La TÁ ene cultures of Europe. As these Celtic populations grew and
expanded in search of new lands, they formed smaller, specialized bands of warriors,
to exer t militar y and diplomatic pressure on target areas, thus forming the advance
guard of an aggressive colonial enterprise. The process has many parallels with the
formation of new and aggressive Gothic and Germanic groupings on the nor th
frontier of the Roman Empire in the third and four th centuries AD
, and their creation
of `barbarian' kingdoms in the former Roman provinces (Strobel 1996). The actual
name Galatai, which seems to derive from a Celtic root which denoted militar y
capacity, was adopted by the Celts themselves to describe these warrior groups
(Schmidt 1994). They also provided a formidable resource of fighting men for
anyone in search of militar y reinforcement. Celtic mercenaries had been employed
in the Classical world since the early four th centur y. Thus in reality their presence was
an oppor tunity, rather than a threat, for the Hellenistic monarchies.
As Memnon reveals, Nikomedes str uck a treaty of alliance with the Galatians. The
advantages for the king were those which the passage expounds: a fighting force
capable of protecting the Greek cities of nor thern Asia Minor and his own kingdom
from the major power in Asia Minor, the Seleukids. The Galatian side of the bargain,
which was doubtless spelled out in the original treaty, becomes clear in the narrative
which follows: they took a major share of the war booty, but above all they obtained
their primar y objective, land for settlement in the central areas of Asia Minor which
lay south-east of Bithynia and also formed a buf fer against Seleukid territories, namely
the new Galatia. The nor thern par ts of central Anatolia in the early third centur y, after
the decline of the Phr ygians, had no natural overlords, and contained land of
excellent agricultural potential, whose inhabitants could easily be subjected to new
masters (Strobel 1996). As its subsequent histor y showed, the region of fered an ideal
environment for the creation of a new Celtic state. The Galatians maintained their
distinctive cultural and political groupings in central Anatolia for 250 years, before
they were incorporated into a Roman province, which even then retained many
distinctive marks of Galatian cultural identity. A form of the Celtic language was
spoken in the region until the sixth centur y AD
(Mitchell 1993: I.42±58).
Despite the attempt by Nikomedes to reser ve Galatian militar y assistance for
himself, in practice they at once played a significant role in the militar y calculations
of all the Hellenistic monarchies. Galatians ser ved as mercenaries in vir tually ever y
major campaign from the 270s until the battle of Actium in 31 (Launey 1949±50).
According to Livy, Nikomedes of Bithynia had initially introduced 10,000 Galatian
warriors to Asia Minor. The r ulers who had made the greatest capital from having
defeated them were the first to enlist Galatian contingents to their forces. Antigonos
288 Stephen Mitchell



Gonatas, after his victor y at L ysimacheia, hired 9000 Galatians to help suppress his
Macedonian rival Antipater Etesias. The Seleukid Antiochos Hierax formed an alli
ance with the Galatians in his rebellious war against his brother Seleukos II, whom he
defeated at a battle near Ankyra. The location of the battle is clear evidence for the
significance of the Galatian role in this war. Ptolemy II hired a contingent of 4000
Gauls to reinforce his control of Alexandria and the Delta, and grave monuments of
Galatian warriors are a feature of the epigraphic record of Egypt. The eastern Anato
lian dynasties of Ariobarzanes I in Cappadocia and Mithradates II in the Pontic region
used the help of Galatian contingents to repel a Ptolemaic naval incursion into the
Black Sea. In 218 B C , five years after the end of the long struggle with the Galatians
and Seleukids for control of L ydia and Mysia, Attalos I settled a new Galatian tribe,
the Aigosages, in the neighbourhood of Abydos on the Hellespont, doubtless to
strengthen his hand in the contest for control of nor th-west Asia Minor with the
Bithynian king Prusias I. Prusias reacted with a pre-emptive strike by destroying the
Galatian force a year later (Polyb. 5.77±8, 5.111).
Thus the militar y activities of the Galatians should only exceptionally be explained
as wars or raids under taken at their own initiative. In the majority of these actions
they were ser ving as major, but subordinate, players in the contests of Hellenistic
kings for control of Anatolia (Strobel 1991). The victories of Antigonos Gonatas,
Antiochos I, Attalos I and Prusias I demonstrated clearly that they could be decisively
defeated by large, well-organized Hellenistic armies, and it would probably have been
within the capacity of any of the kings to drive the Galatians definitively from their
new settlements and bring an end to the Celtic occupation in Asia Minor, had they
chosen to do so. However, they were too useful and impor tant as a source of militar y
manpower for this step to be contemplated, and periodic victories over the Galatians
were too impor tant a source of prestige to be neglected.
The Roman defeat of Antiochos III at the battle of Magnesia in 190, and the
subsequent treaty of Apameia, which excluded the Seleukids from Anatolia nor th of
the Tauros, and reinforced the authority of the Attalids as the main force in the
region, fundamentally redefined power relationships in Asia Minor. Rome was now
potentially or actually the strongest player in regional politics, and its capacity for
action was underlined immediately after Magnesia by the expedition of Manlius Vulso
in 189, who made his way through former Seleukid territor y in Karia, Pisidia and
Phr ygia and ended his campaign with two successful battles against the Galatians in
their own territor y. The historical tradition about this war, principally derived from a
long account in Livy, represents the Galatians as the main target of Manlius' exped
ition. The two battles were described as major Roman victories over a deadly foe,
although the details suggest that Galatian forces were no match for the legions
opposed to them, and the outcome can never have been in any doubt. This tradition
doubtless began with Manlius himself, who sought to gain maximum prestige and
recognition for having destroyed another source of `Gallic terror'. However, this
Roman triumph over the Galatians was in fact exploited for propaganda reasons just
as surely as the earlier victories of Hellenistic kings had been. Moreover, a close look
at the details of the campaign has shown that its real aim was not to extirpate the
Galatians, but to harr y and put pressure on remaining Seleukid forces in Asia Minor,
as Roman negotiators thrashed out the uncompromising terms of the treaty of
Apameia (Grainger 1995b).
The Galatians: Representation and Reality 289



In fact at least until the middle of the second centur y the Galatians remained what
they had been before, a significant but subordinate player in the power struggles of
the region. Although they clearly fell within the Pergamene sphere of influence and
authority, they remained an independent force. They formed alliances with the kings
of Bithynia and of the Pontic region, in their continuing wars with the Attalids. There
are hints that this was not to the dislike of the Romans who preferred not to inter vene
in these regional wars and were happy that the competing forces balanced one
another. Equilibrium was preser ved until the next major alignment of political forces
was initiated by the creation of the Roman province of Asia out of the former
Pergamene kingdom after 133, and the steady growth of the power in the Pontic
region under Mithradates V and Rome's great enemy, Mithradates VI Eupator.
5 Galatian Settlement and Society
The Galatians sur vived these political changes and thrived in their Anatolian home
lands. Our knowledge of Galatian society and political organization in this period
derives from two sources. The first is the account of their constitution, provided by
Strabo in the time of Augustus but evidently relating back to the period before 86B C ,
when Mithradates VI massacred the Galatian leaders in a devastating putsch, which
vir tually annihilated their political leadership:
The three tribes used the same language and dif fered from one another in no other
respect; they were divided each into four sections, and called them tetrarchies, each
having its own tetrarch, one judge, one militar y commander, subordinate to the tetrarch,
and two junior commanders. The council of the twelve tetrarchs consisted of three
hundred men, And they assembled at the so-called Dr ynemetos. The council decided
major cases, the tetrarchs and the judges all the others. (12.5.1)
There is no reason to doubt that this description, derived from an unknown source, is
substantially accurate, and details of Galatian political organization and the functions
of its tribal leaders can be paralleled from Celtic societies in western Europe. In the
east, the Galatians were gradually af fected by the process of hellenization. Some of
their leaders and surely most of those who ser ved for long periods as mercenaries
learned to speak Greek. In the first centur y B C , especially after the massacre of the
leading Galatians by Mithradates, a pattern of hereditar y dynastic rule replaced the
old tribal organization. Galatians were assimilated into local religious structures,
which themselves became recognizably hellenized. Thus the leaders of the Anatolian
sanctuar y of the Great Mother at Pessinous in western Galatia, known by the
Phr ygian cult names as Attis and Battakes, included Galatians, and an imperial
inscription suggests that the hierarchy comprised a college of ten priests, five each
of local and of Galatian origin (Mitchell 1993: I.48). The temple itself, however, had
been rebuilt from white marble in Greek form as an Attalid benefaction around the
mid second centur y B C .
Inscriptions of the Roman imperial period show that the Galatians preser ved their
own ethnic identity, not only through the sur vival of the Celtic language but through
their nomenclature, religious cults and forms of social organization (Mitchell 1982).
Impor tant archaeological discoveries also show that they created a characteristic

a for tified promontor y above the winding course of the Girmir C Ë ay. Sophisticated ashlar
masonr y and the design of the towers and gate indicate Hellenistic influence
pattern of regional settlement on the Anatolian landscape. Strabo and other sources
indicate that the most impor tant type of settlement were for tresses, occupied by local
chieftains. Thanks to recent field work over twenty-five such for ts have now been
located, mostly in the region west of Ankyra occupied by the tribes of the Tolistobogii
and the Tectosages. Typically they are located on strategic hilltops, which control the
system of local communications, but which also dominate extensive stretches of
agricultural territor y. They have well built dr y-stone walls, with carefully protected
gateways, projecting towers and other sophisticated defensive features (Darbyshire et
al. 2000). Only the latest and most elaborate of these for ts, which have been identified
as the strongholds of Deiotaros, the most power ful Galatian king of the first centur y
BC
, show the influence of Hellenistic militar y architecture (figure 17.3; Mitchell 1974).
The others all represent local traditions of building and design. It is also clear that these
for ts did not function simply as strongholds or refuges, but as the kernel of impor tant
agricultural settlements. Sur face obser vations indicate that they were invariably sur
rounded by buildings and field systems. The pattern is unmistakable evidence for the
settlements of a large local population, living in organized village communities and
dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. These settlements give an insight into
the stable base on which Galatian society was built. They are clear testimony to the
success of the Galatian colonization of Asia Minor and explain how these Celtic peoples
retained their identity through the Hellenistic and Roman periods.

291



Their influence was not confined to the core region west and east of modern
Ankara. Burials which can be associated with the Galatians have been found in fer tile
agricultural plains in eastern Bithynia, near Bolu and in the middle Sangarios valley.
Hilltop for tresses with close af finities to those in Galatia have been identified by a
recent sur vey of Paphlagonia. They are evidence for the expansion of Galatian
settlement substantially beyond the original area of settlement. Object finds are
repor ted from an even wider geographical range. Belt-buckles, decorative torques,
fibulae and weapons of distinctive La TÁ ene types have now been recovered from
widely dispersed locations in Asia Minor, including Cappadocia in the south-east,
L ykia and Pisidia in the south-west, Paphlagonia in the nor th as well as findspots
along the western Asia Minor coast. In some cases these may have been associated
with Galatian settlements, but others may reflect the diaspora of Galatian mercenar
ies, whose families often settled in the Greek cities of Asia Minor (Mitchell 1993:
I.57).
The Galatians have hither to occupied a marginal place in modern reappraisals of
the Hellenistic world. This perception rests on a major historical misjudgement.
The presence of these new barbarians in Greece and Asia Minor, and the terror
which their presence inspired, proved less of a threat than an oppor tunity for the
Hellenistic kings to redefine their role in relation to their Greek subjects. Galatian
victories enabled the kings to claim to be the protectors of civilization from chaos and
barbarous annihilation. Their ver y legitimacy as monarchs was reinforced by such
claims and by the ruler cults which the Greeks initiated for their new saviours
(Habicht 1970). The nor therners replaced the Persians as an archetypal symbol of
non-Greek barbarians, and thus contributed to the new definition of what it was to be
Greek in a hellenized world which now encompassed much of Asia.
The Celts meanwhile established themselves as the most successful and long-lasting
external migrants into the Hellenistic world, and took second place only to the Jews
in forming the most successful and enduring non-Greek cultural group within the
western par ts of Alexander's former empire. Literar y and documentar y evidence has
long been available to show how extensive and persistent their settlements in Anatolia
were. It is reasonable to hope that future archaeological discoveries, in addition to
those which have already dramatically changed our understanding of Galatia, will
finally set the record straight and restore the region and its people to proper promin
ence.

Modern scholarship has placed increasing emphasis on the disparity between the
image of the Galatians as barbaric enemies of civilization, which derives from propa
gandistic documentar y and literar y sources, and the dispassionate evidence from
archaeology, which is the source of our information about their way of life in their
new Anatolian homeland. For the image of the Galatians see in par ticular Schalles

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Beyond Greeks and Barbarians:
Italy and Sicily in the
Hellenistic Age
Emma Dench
1 Introduction
In 214 B C Philip V of Macedon wrote to the people and magistrates of Larisa in
Thessaly as follows, urging them to be less exclusive in granting their citizenship to
outsiders, and using Rome as an example to which they might aspire:
For that it is the fairest thing of all for the city to grow strong, with as many as possible
having a par t in the state, and for the land to be worked not badly, as is now the case, I
believe that not one of you would disagree, and it is also possible to look at the others
who make use of similar enrolments of citizens. Among these are the Romans, who
receive into their state even slaves, when they have freed them, giving them a share in the
magistracies, and in such a way not only have they augmented their own fatherland, but
they have also sent out colonies to almost seventy places. (SIG
3 543; trans. as BD 32; also
Austin 60)
This extract from the letter hints at complex issues of heritage and identity in the
Hellenistic world: not least the need for new models in a changing political and social
environment. Impor tantly, Roman behaviour regarding the citizenship, which would
have seemed extraordinar y from the perspective of a Greekpolis, is por trayed in terms
that recall respectably Greek precedents, but these are carefully selected and amal
gamated elements. Rome is the exemplar of inclusiveness, a vir tue that was attributed
by Thucydides to early Athens (1.2.6; cf. 2.39.1), but that has a new urgency in the
changed conditions of the Hellenistic Mediterranean. Philip V is of course silent
about the sometimes more exclusive thought and behaviour of classical Athens
regarding the citizenship (e.g. Parker 1987; Rosivach 1987; Loraux 1993; Ogden
1996: chapter 5). Rome's alleged ability to send out nearly seventy colonies casts her
in the mould of Alexander the Great. The figure of seventy, which bears no relation to
the number of Roman and Latin colonies actually sent out by Rome by 214, is not
plucked out of the air, but recalls traditions on the number of Alexander's own



foundations (cf. Plut. Mor. 328E). It is within such old and new models that Rome's
potentially shocking and distinctively non-Greek habit of enfranchising considerable
numbers of ex-slaves is framed. Philip V's letter is a prime example of the increasing
recognition of Rome on the par t of mainland Greece, as well as Rome's own
increasing interest in the image of Alexander and the Hellenistic kingdoms. But it is
impor tant to contextualize this mutual recognition within the broader environment
of peninsular Italy and Sicily, over which Rome was beginning to gain supremacy in
the decades immediately following the death of Alexander the Great. It is only within
this broader context that we can begin to distinguish the more peculiar aspects of
Roman expansion and rule.
This chapter explores the ideological and cultural dynamics of massive political
changes in Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic age: in shor t, it asks in what sense and in
what form Italy became Roman and Rome became Italian, at a time when Rome was
becoming mistress of the Mediterranean world. There are obvious dangers in writing
an overly teleological account of ancient Italy, one that constantly projects the future
greatness of Rome and devalues the historical significance of other peoples, cultures
and communities in Italy and Sicily. It is impor tant to understand the histor y of the
emergence of Rome within the context of the peculiar dynamics of Italy and Sicily,
par tly precisely in order to avoid believing that Roman hegemony was inevitable, and
par tly in order to avoid exaggerating the uniqueness of Roman behaviour. Never the
less, Roman hegemony in Italy and Sicily, or indeed in the Mediterranean world, did
not entail the loss of individual local identities, of distinctive histories, or of divergent
cultural models, and questions about the nature of ethnic and cultural plurality in the
Roman west correspond to the interesting questions scholars are currently asking
about the Hellenistic East (cf. Car tledge 1997: 4±6; for map of the west, figure 4.1
this volume).
2 Historiography
The political fragmentation of the Hellenistic Mediterranean world, the lack of a
central point, whether this is perceived as a handicap to the study of this period or,
alternatively, one of the aspects that makes it so exciting, has had an obvious ef fect on
the traditional historiography of Hellenistic Italy and Sicily. `Greek' and `Roman'
histor y, as it has been traditionally studied in schools and universities, has been driven
by major extant `great' ancient textual narratives, from Herodotos and Thucydides to
Polybios, Livy and Tacitus. From such a perspective Italy and Sicily are impor tant
arenas for major political and militar y events, such as the Athenians' Sicilian exped
ition in 415 B C , the Roman conquest of Italy in the four th and third centuries, or the
outbreak of the First Punic War. In contrast, the histories of Syracuse, of Tarentum, of
Neapolis (modern Naples), or of the Samnites, Etruscans, Umbrians or Lucanians,
based on a combination of lesser or fragmented texts, and above all on material
evidence, are traditionally perceived as `local' histories of, at best, tangential relevance
to the mainstream histories of Greece and Rome.
This problem of a place in histor y is well illustrated by the arrangement of material
into chapters and volumes in the new edition of the Cambridge Ancient Histor y: any
sense of continuity is disrupted by appor tioning some aspects of the histor y of Italy
and Sicily to essentially Greek or Roman political narratives, and relegating others to
Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic Age 295



area studies (Millar 1995). The concentration on the major political narratives of
Greece and Rome reflects a series of nineteenth- and early twentieth-centur y intellec
tual traditions in the western world. Strands in the tradition that are par ticularly
relevant to the ancient histor y of Italy and Sicily include the impact of the modern
ideology of unification in later nineteenth- and twentieth-centur y Italy, with ancient
Rome perceived as the first bringer of unity to Italy. More broadly, nineteenth- and
early twentieth-centur y theories of the naturalness and inevitability of nations have
had a major impact on modern readings of the making of Roman Italy, while the
appropriation of Rome as a model for a number of European empires, including
the British Empire, has influenced perceptions of the place of Rome and Roman
culture within Italy (e.g. Mouritsen 1998; Ceserani 2000; Hingley 2000). In the
English-language academic tradition within which the Cambridge Ancient Histor y
needs to be contextualized, the problem is compounded by the comparatively late
recognition of the value of archaeology for the understanding, rather than the
illustration, of the ancient world (e.g. M. Clarke 1959: 120; Stray 1998: 207, 310±
11). The subsequent development of an essentially separate discipline of archaeology
that maintains a somewhat strained relationship with ancient histor y has to some
extent hindered the integration of properly analysed text with properly analysed
material evidence (Halsall 1997).
If we look now at the problem from the opposite direction, a traditional emphasis
on grand Hellenocentric or Romanocentric narratives has historically encouraged the
development of proudly or romantically `small' histories of the peoples or poleis of
Italy and Sicily. Such accounts gained momentum in the par ticular ideological condi
tions of Italy of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when there was a
tendency amongst, in par ticular, the bourgeoisie of central and southern Italy to
identify with the pre-Roman peoples of Italy, emphasizing traditions of a proud,
independent past (Torelli 1999: 2). It is, however, wor th noting that this was par t
of a much broader humanistic interest that had in the seventeenth and earlier
eighteenth centuries focused par ticularly on the Etruscans. Some of the impetus
for eighteenth centur y Italian enthusiasm for the Etruscans and other non-Roman
peoples came from an unpublished manuscript, De Etruria Regali, written by
Thomas Dempster, a Scot by bir th, who had died in 1625 a professor at Bologna
(Momigliano 1966: 18±20). For rather dif ferent reasons, there remains today, espe
cially in Italian publications aimed at a broad audience, a strong focus on the origins
and Iron Age, pre-Roman cultures of Italy: fostering a sense of distinctive, individual
and sometimes independent local identities has a strong popular appeal. The impor t
ance of regional identities in modern Italian culture is also sometimes par t of the
impetus for extremely reputable scholarly enterprises, well presented museums and
well-catalogued exhibitions (e.g. Dench 1995: 8 for Molise, ancient Samnium).
These kinds of interests in pre-Roman histor y are based on the assumption (tacit or
other wise) that individual local identities were compromised or destroyed by the
Roman conquest.
There are also other, more regionally specific `ways of seeing' with longer or
shor ter histories that have shaped the modern historiography of Hellenistic Italy.
These include the `problem' of South Italy, that is, modern perceptions of the
permanent and intransigent nature of a range of aspects associated with the south,
par ticularly at the end of the nineteenth and during the first half of the twentieth
296 Emma Dench



centur y, including economic decline, depopulation and organized crime (Gribaudi
1996; J. Dickie 1997). Such perceptions are reflected in the motif of the timelessness
of life in non-urban southern Italy that is to be found in some modern accounts of the
area in ancient times (e.g. Barker 1995). There has, more specifically, sometimes been
a tendency in modern writing to elide the ver y dif ferent historical circumstances of
the late nineteenth and earlier twentieth centur y with the perceived decline of,
especially, the Greek poleis around the time of the Roman conquest (e.g. Toynbee
1965: I.162±3; II.35). Ancient historiographical traditions `explaining' why the poleis
of Magna Graecia succumbed to Roman conquest have sometimes been brought in
to enhance the picture of timeless decline, ignoring the culturally peculiar emphasis
on luxur y and excess (Purcell 1994: 389 with bibliography).
More recently, questions have been raised about the origins and cultural identity of
what today is nor thern Italy. While the bourgeoisie of central and southern Italy were
dreaming of their pre-Roman past, their counterpar ts in the nor th dreamed rather of
their proud status during the Renaissance (Torelli 1999: 2). Most recently, questions
of the cultural roots of the nor th have again become profoundly politicized in some
quar ters: here, an insistence on the essentially `Mediterranean' nature of Hellenistic
culture, unobjectionable from the perspective of an ancient cultural historian, may be
extremely provocative to those who would prefer to insist on distinct, `nor thern'
roots (Denti 1991: 7±10).
I have already begun to hint at ways in which scholarship has been moving beyond
an over-emphasis on Rome in the Hellenistic age, whether this is manifested in
accounts that end with the Roman conquest and the implied death of local identity
and culture, or in accounts that constantly look for ward to the coming of the nation
state with the coming of Rome. These are obviously two sides of the same coin. Since
the mid-1970s, the emphasis of (especially French- and Italian-speaking) sophisti
cated individual and collected studies of, especially, material evidence has been on
modes of interaction rather than on romantically fragmented individual histories (P.
Zanker 1976; Modes de contacts 1983; Italici in Magna Grecia 1990; Mertens and
Lambrechts 1991). These have contributed to a more sensitive understanding of the
processes of what are traditionally described as `Hellenization' and `Romanization'.
These processes include the appropriation and adaptation of dif ferent cultural `lan
guages', including `Greek' motifs, to ar ticulate in unique ways individual cultural
concerns. They also include the understanding of patterns of local settlement and the
expression of local identities before, during, and after the Roman conquest of Italy.
These studies have serious general consequences for our perceptions of the growth
and ar ticulation of Roman power and Roman identity, which is revealed as both more
and less extraordinar y within the context of Hellenistic Italy and Sicily. One of the
remaining problems of modern scholarship is that these sophisticated studies of Sicily
and Italy have had little impact on major narratives and collected works on the
Hellenistic world as a whole: there is still a tendency to privilege the Hellenistic
kingdoms of the East on the one side, and the coming of Rome, somewhat decon
textualized from Italy, on the other side. This may in par t explain a tendency to begin
to be interested in Roman histor y only at the beginning of the First Punic War. It may
also begin to explain scholarly preoccupation with the Roman reception of Greek
culture during and immediately after Roman inter vention in the Greek mainland and
the Hellenistic kingdoms of the east, neglecting, to some extent, Roman reception of
Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic Age 297



other cultures in Italy, and, indeed, earlier reception of Greek culture through contact
with south Italy and Sicily.
3 Characterizing Relationships: Old Ways of Seeing in a New World
We need to understand the relationship between peoples and cultures in Hellenistic
Italy and Sicily within the context of current scholarly debates about relationships
during the archaic and classical periods. For example, the commonly used phrase
`Greek colonization' has recently been problematized in scholarly accounts. Ques
tions have been asked about how far there was anything `Greek' about the `coloniza
tion' of Italy and Sicily in either the sense of collective activity or in the sense of self
conscious or recognized shared culture. While recent scholarly accounts suggest the
possibility of an emerging, aggregative sense of Greek identity in the archaic period,
what seems most impor tant in the `colonies' of Italy and Sicily is the relationship with
individual mother-cities, as well as the establishment of distinctive identities for the
new settlements. The term `colonization' is reminiscent of the activity of modern,
European empires, and might carr y overtones inappropriate to the archaic Mediterra
nean, such as those of a deliberate process, of a cultural, technological and/or
religious polarity between `natives' and `colonists'. We should instead imagine a
whole range of relationships formed between the newly arrived and local peoples:
the emergent poleis, with their restricted territories, of necessity grew up to a greater
or lesser extent dependent on local resources and peoples, while the ever-expanding
world was mapped by mythological genealogies of wandering heroes ± Odysseus,
Herakles or Aeneas ± that tended to write in rather than exclude new peoples (e.g.
Bickermann 1952; Graham 1964; Malkin 1987; 1998; C. Morgan 1991; 1993;
Dougher ty 1993; Dench 1995: 47±50; J. Hall 1997; Erskine 2001).
It is in the fifth centur y, in the aftermath of the Persian Wars, that the notion of
`Greekness' defined in opposition to the barbarian first appears as an impor tant means
of thinking about identity, although this notion always exists in competition with
other ways of figuring identity, such as those based on the individual polis (E. Hall
1989; cf. Walbank 1951). The notion of a common, even `global' barbarian enemy is
illustrated by explicit references to western contexts in contemporar y Greek litera
ture. As early as 470, Pindar celebrated in an ode the victor y in the chariot-race at
Delphi of Hieron I, tyrant of Syracuse. In the course of this, he linked Syracuse's rout
of `Tyrrhenians' (Etruscans) and Car thaginians at Cumae on the Bay of Naples with
the victor y of the Athenians over the Persians at Salamis, and that of the Spartans at
Plataia. This tradition suggested an equation of Car thaginians and `Tyrrhenians' with
Persians, and the western battles with the battles of Salamis and Plataia, which had
rapidly acquired a quasi-mythological status (Pyth. I.72 f f.; cf. Hdt. 7.166; E. Hall
1989).
The most convenient aspect of the rhetorical proclamation of Greek superiority to
`the barbarian' was, of course, the multitude of experience amongst the various Greek
states that could be encompassed within it. The Athenians' claims for hegemony in
and beyond the Aegean through their role in fending of f `the barbarian' were only the
star t of it. In southern Italy, a world in which ethnic relations were more complex, the
Tarentines, who periodically both enjoyed and found comfor table ways of talking
about their close relationship with their Oscan-speaking neighbours, the Samnites,
298 Emma Dench



were especially eager to adver tise in cer tain contexts their own par t in the struggle
against the now generic barbarian. Pausanias describes two ex votos offered by the
Tarentines at the panhellenic sanctuar y at Delphi during the fifth centur y, both
apparently emphasizing Tarentine supremacy over various south Italian barbaroi,
the Messapians in the first and the Peucetii and their Iapygian ally, Opis, in the
second. Pausanias' juxtaposition of the second to the Greek dedication after Plataia
is no accident (10.10.6; 10.13.9±10).
At first, we might want to think of the examples discussed above as, essentially,
par ticipation in a new, pan-Mediterranean discussion of what it was to be Greek. But
we should also emphasize the par ticularity of local circumstances. For the poleis of
Sicily and southern Italy, the period from the late fifth centur y until well into the third
was one of real change. Above all, the political independence of the poleis was
challenged and compromised by competing powers, not least when the Samnites
and Romans competed for supremacy in peninsular Italy from the last decades of the
four th centur y. The most striking individual examples include the political takeover of
the Greek polis Poseidonia by Oscan-speaking people by the end of the fifth centur y,
and the takeover of Messana in the 280s by the Oscan-speaking mercenaries of
Agathokles, after his death (Costabile 1984; Dench 1995: 55±6). The expression of
Greek superiority over the barbarian, essentially in cultural terms, was an impor tant
way of conceptualizing these changes: Greekness is imagined to be threatened by the
arrival of the `barbarian', and needs actively to be preser ved. The perceived threat to
the Greek language is not infrequently repeated (e.g. [Plato] Ep. 8.353e on Sicily;
Athen. 14.632a on Poseidonia/Paestum).
It is essential that we realize the aspirational nature of this cultural dichotomy
between Greek and barbarian: it does not describe at all literally the closely interactive
nature of both cultures and relationships between peoples in central and southern
Italy before, during or after the four th centur y, or the kind of cultural continuities
that we can obser ve here. One might think, for example, of the spatial geography of
Paestum, the most clear-cut example of political change, where the political spaces of
the former Greek polis, Poseidonia, were apparently retained unchanged (Greco and
Theodorescu 1983: 81f f.; Cur ti et al. 1996: 183). Lessons in the subtlety of cultural
identity and cultural change can also be learned from the remarkable corpus of
Poseidonian/Paestan tomb-painting which spans from the fifth centur y to the
third, that is from the period of the `Greek' city through the political takeover by
Oscan-speakers to the aftermath of the Roman conquest. The careful creation of
typologies and of close iconographical readings of individual tombs, the painted walls
of which create a narrative, make this a par ticularly suggestive body of evidence.
Taking the famous example of the Tomb of the Diver from the first half of the fifth
centur y, that is, the `Greek' period, the immediate question to ask is how `Greek' is
painting of this kind, when the closest and most obvious points of comparison are to
be found within the Etrusco-Campanian environment. Nor can the `arrival of the
barbarians' be tracked through any abrupt cultural caesura or through the `deterior
ation' of cultural expression, although such interpretations are suggested in older ar t
historical works (e.g. Trendall 1967: 150±5, 185±8). What one notices above all in
four th-centur y Paestan tomb-painting, and, indeed, grave-goods in Paestum, is a
cer tain kind of cultural continuity. The culturally-specific preoccupations of a non
Greek elite are emphasized by the use of motifs common to various peoples of south
Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic Age 299



Italy: it is, above all, the formula and the emphases that are distinct. For example,
vases suggesting an enduring taste for `Greek' mythological scenes are placed with the
dead, but, in contrast with the burials of the `Greek' phase of the town, with their
sparse grave-goods, there is clearly now a concern to mark and dif ferentiate both the
social status and the gender of the dead. Evidence of this kind acts as a power ful
reminder of the fact that the categories of `Greek' and `barbarian' do not exist as
culturally hermetically sealed entities (Greco Pontrandolfo 1979; Pontrandolfo and
Rouveret 1992).
While the theme of Greek superiority to the Barbarian was clearly a power ful one
for the Greek poleis of south Italy, the paradox was that it was not necessar y for a
community to identify itself, or to be identified, as Greek in order to appropriate this
par ticular way of expressing superiority. It is again in Paestan tomb-painting that we
can begin to glimpse the `transferability' of this idea. For example, a tomb with a
par ticularly suggestive sequence was discovered during the nineteenth centur y, and
then unfortunately destroyed, the paintings known only from drawings made at the
time. Paintings on the walls of the tomb, to which a date between the late four th and
early third centuries B C has been ascribed, show scenes of the life of the dead man,
with emphasis on his status as a horseman and warrior, in a manner familiar to Paestan
and Campanian tomb-painting. On the two long walls, the horseman is shown in full
Paestan panoply, with characteristic plumed helmet and cuirass, fighting an Amazon
in one scene, and a man in a Phr ygian-style helmet in the other. That we are meant to
draw parallels between the two scenes seems clear, and the motif of the Amazon
indicates both a real comprehension of Greek symbolism, which regularly casts
Amazons and Phr ygians in the losing role of the barbarian, pitted against the
victorious Greek. But more striking still are indications of the way in which such
imager y is being re-deployed. The identity of the Phr ygian-helmeted man whose
losing position answers to that of the Amazon in the other scene is not entirely clear,
but the possibility remains open that this is a Greek. If this is the case, asser tions of
Greek superiority over the barbarian would not just be elegantly re-interpreted, but
also turned upside-down (Rouveret and Greco Pontrandolfo 1983; 1985; Cur ti et al.
1996: 183± 4).
Finally, we can obser ve Rome enter this par ticular dimension by studying a late
four th-centur y series of polychrome vases from Arpi, a Daunian community which,
under pressure from its hostile Samnite neighbours, appealed for Roman suppor t and
was received into a treaty of alliance (Livy 9.13.7). This series of vases represents
winners and losers in battle, and follows a clearly identifiable set of iconographical
rules: the winners are made to occupy the role of `Greeks', while the losers are
attributed the representational space and posture of `barbarians'. In the clearest
example, the winner in the role of the `Greek' is to be identified by his unmistakable
Roman armour, the loser in the role of the `barbarian' by his characteristically
Samnite armour (Mazzei 1987; Cur ti et al. 1996: 184).
The impact of Alexander the Great on ideologies of `imperial' expansion, power
and indeed monarchy itself is most familiar to us in late Republican and Augustan
Rome. We might think, for example, of Pompey's acquired epithet, Magnus, or
por traits of Pompey, or well-publicized anecdotes of Octavian paying his respects to
Alexander's corpse, all examples of a complex relationship, emphasizing simultan
eously Rome's closeness to and distance from Hellenistic models (Treves 1953;
300 Emma Dench



Weipper t 1972; P. Zanker 1988: 8±11; Smith 1988: 135±9; Carlsen 1993). Roman
`reception' of Alexander may in fact be traced much fur ther back in time, as we have
already begun to see from the example of Philip V's letter. We need also to under
stand Roman `reception' of imager y and ideas associated with Alexander and the
Macedonian kingdoms within the broader context of the `reception' of such motifs in
Hellenistic Italy and Sicily. Along with motifs that have their origins in the classical
Greek world, such as Greeks and barbarians, the imager y associated with Alexander
and the Macedonian kingdoms is par t of the shared conceptual range of the post
classical world in which Rome gradually emerges as a serious contender.
In a digression from his narrative of the Samnite Wars, Livy poses the question of
what would have happened if Alexander the Great had come to Italy and tried his luck
against Rome. His long rhetorical `proof ' of how Alexander would have been beaten
soundly by these manliest of men is no more and no less than a mar vellous example of
much-maligned counter-factual histor y (9.17±19). We might, however, want to pose
a more serious set of questions about the contemporar y and near-contemporar y
impact of Alexander and, above all, early Hellenistic kingship in Italy and Sicily, and
specifically about the models of power that this came to represent. The most precise
examples are those of the tyrants of Syracuse at the end of the four th centur y
and beginning of the third. In a manner that seems altogether typical of the self
consciously post-classical world that was Hellenistic Italy and Sicily, tales that
self-consciously linked them to an older tradition of tyranny in the Greek world
were an impor tant aspect of their image (Lewis 2000). Such stor y-telling was,
however, combined with flir tation with newer models of monarchy. For example,
Agathokles of Syracuse became closely involved with Ptolemy I of Egypt, approaching
the threat of Car thage from a new angle, and subsequently assumed the royal title of
basileus
in the last years of the four th centur y BC
, in apparent self-conscious emulation
of the Diadochoi (Diod. 20.54.1; Meister 1984). Rome's future ally, Hieron II, was
also proclaimed
basileus
in 270, and, in Hellenistic fashion, conferred upon himself
the regal diadem associated with Dionysian victor y (Smith 1988: 34± 40).
More generally, in the last decades of the four th centur y, south Italian ideological
languages of opposition and conquest were much inspired by Macedonian regal
images of victor y: the adver tised acquisition of `spear-won territor y' was a cr ucial
aspect of Macedonian kingship (Walbank 1984c: 66). The representation of Nike, the
goddess of victor y, driving her chariot towards the heavens, ultimately dedicated in
the late Republic on the Capitol by Lucius Munatius Plancus is attributed by the
Elder Pliny to Nikomachos of Thebes, who worked for the Macedonian cour t, while
the broader identification of the Roman mid-Republican cult of Victoria with Hel
lenistic Nike is a real possibility (
HN
35.108; H È olscher 1967). This interest may
prefigure the Roman fascination with these models of monarchy and regal behaviour
that are clearly an impor tant cultural reference-point from at least the second centur y
BC
(Rawson 1975; Walbank 1984c: 99). Nike was popular in Tarentine iconography
of the late four th centur y, being represented in the form of statues, on the coinage of
the Tarentine leader Archytas, and on coin issues commemorating the feats of the
various generals who arrived from mainland Greece to join forces against the local
`barbarians'. The poses in which Nike is represented recur: she drives her chariot ± in
south Italy, the two-horsed chariot is favoured ± crowns conquering horsemen, or
bears a trophy (Weinstock 1957).
Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic Age
301



Meanwhile, confusing nicely the dichotomies of which Greek thought was fond,
the conquests of Alexander reawakened interest in the orientalized taste of `the
barbarian', an image that has its origins in fifth-centur y Athenian representations of
Persians. Depictions of Persians were in vogue in South Italy, in and beyond the
Greek poleis, as can be seen most famously in the case of the so-called Darius Vase, a
large volute-crater found at Canosa, depicting the protection of Hellas by Athena,
Asia lured to her doom by a Fur y, Darius himself in full costume directly under Zeus,
and an assor tment of grovelling Oriental vassals bringing tribute to the cof fers as the
bottom scene (Metzger 1967; Trendall and Cambitoglou 1982: 495 with plate
176.1; Francis 1990: 36±9; Dench 1997: 130±1).
The Darius Vase of fers clues to a revival of interest in themes of luxur y, success and
failure, and the rise and fall of empires, through Alexander's conquest of the Persian
Empire. Such themes are apparent in Hellenistic historiography on the decadence and
decline of the poleis of Magna Graecia as Rome begins to be dominant in the early
third centur y B C : decadence ever y bit as shocking as that ascribed to Persia can
usefully explain the subordination of the Greeks to a more austere enemy. We can
also trace late four th-centur y Tarentine traditions about the Pythagorean leader
Archytas, who allegedly discoursed in the presence of Plato and the wise Samnite
leader, Pontius Herennius, on vice and vir tue in the form, respectively, of the denial of
pleasures and the promotion of austerity. Thus, one implication is Archytas' Taren
tum might be distanced from other, decadent poleis of Magna Graecia, escaping
defeat and decline (Cic. Sen. 39± 41; cf. Athen. 12.545a). The idea of `barbarian'
involvement in such discussions can be traced elsewhere in the late four th centur y.
Archytas' Tarentum, not coincidentally in need of manpower, was apparently engaged
in a dialogue with the Samnites, creating for them an ancestr y in common with their
own Spar tan roots, as well as a range of suitably austere ethnographical traditions
(Strabo 5.4.12). Early third-centur y Lucanian tomb-paintings, like the grave-goods
of Paestum, suggest an emphasis on austerity and controlled behaviour. It is within
such contexts that traditions about the legendar y austere behaviour of mid-Repub
lican Roman generals, such as M'. Curius Dentatus, who supposedly refused Samnite
bribes of gold while dining on turnips from coarseware, begin to look like more than
just later Republican back-projection. What we can see here is the reinterpretation
within new contexts and with new meaning of essentially classical and pre-classical
modes of thought about success and failure, as various peoples of south Italy com
peted to claim for themselves the success that surely attended austere behaviour
(Dench 1995: 101±2; 1997: 138).
We can see, then, that the ideology of victor y and conquest inspired by Macedon,
Pythagorean traditions on success and failure, and even that most `Greek' of all
themes, the definition of `Greek' in opposition to the `barbarian', were ver y far
from being exclusive to the Greek poleis, emphasizing once again the high degree
of communication between the various peoples of central and southern Italy. The
intensely competitive environment of late four th- and early third-centur y Italy may be
illustrated by the alacrity with which dif ferent peoples seized on these vocabularies,
casting themselves, or their friends, in the `winning' roles. When Rome and the
Samnites fought for hegemony over peninsular Italy, and par ticularly for the friend
ship of the more powerful of the Greek poleis, such as Neapolis in 327 B C , the ultimate
card was philhellenism, the rules of which both societies knew ver y well (D.H.Ant.
302 Emma Dench



Rom. 15.5ff.; Frederiksen 1984: 201 ff.; Dench 1995: 54). As always, it is the
winning side that we, as historians, hear most clearly, and, in this case, we know
most about the continued preoccupation of Rome in the later Republic and well
beyond with the kind of themes that we have explored in this section and the previous
one: the precariousness of imperial success and the constant need to regulate the
behaviour of the elite; Rome as the civilized, `Greek' centre of urbanity, rightly
dominant over a barbarian, rustic Italy; the delineation of increasingly prominent
individuals by reference to Hellenistic monarchs.
In these ways, the peoples of central and southern Italy used common ideological
motifs to create culturally specific `languages' of their own. We are inclined to place a
dispropor tionate amount of emphasis on aspects of these `languages' that we identify
as `Greek'. This is par tly because of the prestige of Greekness, recognized and
asser ted in so much of the Mediterranean in dif ferent ways in the classical, Hellenistic
and imperial periods, and par tly because of the aesthetic judgements and preoccupa
tions peculiar to our own, modern societies with their own complex histories of
`receiving' classical culture. It is for these reasons that we look for, and worr y about,
the `Hellenization' of Rome and Italy, rather than `Italicization' or `Lucanization' (cf.
Cur ti et al. 1996: 188).
That said, however, the discussion of the `Hellenization' of Rome and Italy, or,
slightly less provocatively, `Hellenism' in Italy, has by and large taken place on a
sophisticated level. Pioneering studies looked for models and parallels in the modern
world, and it is perhaps Clara Gallini's ar ticle of 1973, `Che cosa intendere per
ellenizzazione' (`What is the meaning of Hellenization?'), that still of fers greatest
insight into what `Hellenization' is, and, above all, the sor ts of questions that we need
to ask before making any assumptions. Gallini's models for the `Hellenization' of
Rome were modern African states such as Tanzania that had appropriated European
political and cultural motifs in their struggle for independence, and the Japanese
appropriation of American modes of production and culture that were instrumental
in the emergence of Japan as an economic world-leader, challenging the status of the
USA. In both cases, `foreign' cultural motifs were used in the asser tion of forcefully
independent identities in a manner that is suggestive for later Republican Rome.
Besides emphasizing the active processes of creativity on the par t of the `Hellen
ized' Romans, as well as the fact that `Hellenization' had dif ferent significance at
dif ferent historical moments, the real value of Gallini's article was that, for example,
the Japanese appropriation of American culture is not envisaged to require the
assumption of an identity that is not Japanese (Cur ti et al. 1996: 182). In this
context, it is wor th spelling out the fact that, in ancient Italy, the `Hellenization' of
non-Greek peoples that we may catalogue is extremely rarely accompanied by the
acceptance of a change in character to a Greek polis. Rome's suppor ters, ranging from
Herakleides of Pontos to Dionysios of Halikarnassos, might have mused on the
Greekness of her identity, while, amongst the Romans themselves, `foreignness'
might periodically be perceived to compromise `real' Romanness, whatever that was
imagined to be (Cornell 1995: 398; Beard et al. 1998: 87±98). But the case of Rome
was in no ways parallel to that of the once-Bruttian town of Petelia, which, despite the
Oscan nomenclature of her magistrates in the third to second centuries, sent a
theorodokos to Delphi, and proudly recorded the names of gymnasiarchs (Manganaro
1964; Costabile 1984: 67).
Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic Age 303



In the decades since Gallini's ar ticle was published, scholarly awareness of the
dangers suggested by the term `Hellenization' has grown: awareness of the danger
of implying agency, a process that is always the same, the existence of an active and a
passive player in the process, is to be generally noted. Linguistic metaphors for the
expression of individual cultural identities, and the creation of new identities, have
been usefully explored, and get close to the subtlety required of this field of study
(e.g. Gr uzinski and Rouveret 1976; Wallace-Hadrill 1998).
However, one interesting, and potentially dangerous phenomenon to be obser ved
in recent studies ± or rather critiques ± of both `Hellenization' and `Romanization' is
a tendency to play down, almost to the point of eliminating, any sense of power
relations between dif ferent peoples or even amongst one people, of cultural prestige,
or of expressions of anxiety about identities perceived to be compromised by `foreign'
culture, which are to be plainly seen in the ver y dif ferent contexts of Rome and
Judaea. There are hints here of a modern western sensitivity about relationships of
power, a sensitivity fostered by studies of gender, race and class in both the modern
west and the post-colonial world. Some of the ver y dif ferent perspectives on the
processes of cultural change may be seen in a selection of recent scholarly work
written by individuals from a number of dif ferent cultural, intellectual and disciplin
ar y backgrounds (e.g. BÂ enabou 1976; Hengel 1980; Gr uen 1992; 1998; Webster
and Cooper 1996; Mattingly 1997; Woolf 1998; Cur ti 2001).
4 Plural Societies
`Traditional' Roman openness to foreigners and `generosity' with her citizenship was,
Rome's friends liked to claim, nothing new (Gauthier 1974). For a number of
dif ferent reasons, Athens is the model most frequently cited or hinted at by authors
with stances as dif ferent as those of Livy and Dionysios of Halikarnassos in the
Augustan age, and Aelius Aristides of the so-called Second Sophistic (Livy 1.8.6;
D. H.
Ant. Rom
. 2.15.3± 4, cf. Thuc. 1.2.5±6; Aristid.
Rom. Or.
60±1;
Panath.
332).
Such references speak volumes about the periodic impor tance of Athens as a cultural
reference-point for Rome in the early imperial period, but should not lead
us
to
ignore the more immediate context of Hellenistic Italy and Sicily that will show up
more clearly the peculiarity of Rome.
Athens is not, from a modern perspective, the most obvious exemplar of inclusive
ness. While recent studies have, interestingly, emphasized the role of the Piraeus as a
booming multi-ethnic and multi-cultural community on which the success of the
polis
depended, the Periklean citizenship-law of 452/1 represents an attempt to restrict
the citizenship on an unusually tight definition of descent (von Reden 1995; 1998;
Car tledge 1998). In the broad context of Mediterranean histor y, it is Athens that
seems the anomaly, but it is through Athenian eyes that we most immediately judge
the rather dif ferent environment of the west. Most famous of all are Thucydidean
images of late fifth-centur y Sicily, of ethnic and historical fragmentation, of the
disparate hugeness that might recall a Herodotean Persian Empire, of the fault-lines
hoped for by Athenian for tune-hunters doomed to tragic failure (Harrison 2000).
From a western perspective, early attempts to conceptualize in geographical terms
new collectivities ± Italia or Magna Graecia ± suggest on an ideological plane the
physical necessity of looking outwards. Not that this was without dif ficulty: conflict
304
Emma Dench



ing traditions on the limits of Italia, beginning with fragments of the fifth-centur y
western Greek writer, Antiochos of Syracuse, suggest the fraught dynamics of power
between the poleis of the far south, and there is no sense of linear growth. There are
interesting hints, however, of attempts to write in the ethnic diversity of the south. In
spatial terms, this might be seen in conceptualizations of Italia as an isthmus (the
boundaries of which dif fer according to context), combining coast-line and interior,
thus writing in the relevant local peoples of the interior (Prontera 1986; cf. Lepore
1963). In mythographical terms, this can be seen in Dionysios of Halikarnassos'
representation of antiquarian tradition on the successive kings of southern Italy,
including Italus, Morges and Siculus, as if someone somewhere had tried to make
sense of a composite ethnic reality by putting it into a pseudo-historical order ( Ant.
Rom. 1.11). It is Dionysios too who credits Hellanikos of Lesbos, the fifth-centur y
mythographer and geographer, with a version of the naming of Italia that involves
dialogue between Herakles and the local people of south Italy, as he looks for his lost
calf. This version seems clearly to mythologize some of the realities both of the
foundation and the sur vival of the Greek colonies of southern Italy (FGrH 4 F111
Ant. Rom. 1.35; Lepore 1985; Dench 1995: 11).
Investigation of the term Magna Graecia, or, in Greek, Megale Hellas, ascribed
usually to var ying areas of southern Italy, again suggests a sense of competing
versions, leading to intense debates amongst both ancient authors and modern
scholars. One of the more suggestive interpretations of the term is its association
with four th-centur y post-Pythagorean thought of the kind that we have seen above,
centred on the figure of Archytas of Tarentum. Megale Hellas was, according to this
interpretation, an expandable ideal that could (in some versions) bring in non-Greek
leaders, and even whole peoples, accommodating them through ideologies of good
government and moral behaviour (Calderone 1976; Musti 1988; Dench 1995: 60).
While we should never underestimate competition and tensions within traditions, the
idea that we might see here some attempt to talk about what was literally common
ground is highly suggestive.
The challenge of manpower in the relatively small, sometimes beleagueredpoleis of
southern Italy and Sicily gave impetus to more inclusive ideologies and behaviour. The
most obvious solution to the problem of manpower was to recruit forces from neigh
bouring non-Greek peoples, and different poleis understood and formalized this rela
tionship in dif ferent ways at dif ferent times. The Deinomenids, tyrants of Syracuse
provided a fifth-centur y precedent for the ever-more pressurized poleis of the late
four th and early third centuries when they appealed to the `mainstream' ideology of
citizen soldiers by enfranchising the non-Greek forces they employed as manpower,
reversing but retaining the ideological connection between citizenship and fighting for
the polis (Frederiksen 1984: 193; cf. 203, n. 120; Purcell 1994: 385). The extension of
the citizenship both rewarded these forces by allowing access to privileges and formal
ized the obligation to fight for the polis (Tagliamonte 1994: 114±23). For the Tar
entines in the latter par t of the fourth centur yB C , the Samnite forces they had recruited
were conceptualized as the long-lost Pitanate cousins of the originally Spartan Tar
entines: the unfavourable image of using mercenar y forces was avoided by appeal to the
common `language' of shared origins (Strabo 5.4.12; Dench 1995: 53±61).
These are the general contexts within which we need to understand early instances
of Roman concessions of citizenship and other statuses, which is in itself intimately
Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic Age 305



bound up with the development of a specifically Roman sense of Italia. Some
instances seem ver y close to western Greek examples, such as the status of cives sine
suffragio (`citizens without the vote'), possibly a Roman version of honorific, non
par ticipator y citizenship, held in conjunction with one's original citizenship, and
acceptance in fidem (under the `protection' of Rome) (Frederiksen 1984: 193±8).
While being careful to think of early Roman concessions of the citizenship in appro
priately comparative terms, after 338 B C , when the Romans secured the submission
of all the neighbouring Latin peoples and some others, we can begin to see signs
of peculiar developments. Significant leaps of imagination and experiments were
required, and these were to provide the models upon which future developments in
the Roman Empire were based. As we move into the third centur y B C , the Roman
settlement of peninsular Italy after her wars of conquest begins to set Rome apart
from her western Greek neighbours, par tly in terms of scale, although we will
continue to obser ve practice that recalls theirs. The treaties drawn up between
Rome and individual Italian communities were based on manpower, and vast
numbers were mobilized. Roman territor y itself was also extended on a massive
scale: M'. Curius Dentatus car ved a swathe of Roman territor y all the way to the
Adriatic at the beginning of the third centur y, incorporating the inhabitants originally
as cives sine suffragio, perhaps reinterpreted now as a punitive measure. In his boast of
victor y over so many men and their land, we may want to see echoes of the ideology
of Hellenistic kingship, with its emphasis on victor y and `spear-won territor y'
(A. Sher win-White 1973: 38±53; Purcell 1990a).
There were few juridically Roman colonies: in the third and early second centuries,
colonies were largely Latin in status. This reinterpretation of an ethno-geographical
term as a term used to delineate a par ticular juridical status in relation to dealings with
Roman citizens is extremely significant. In par t, we might see here an attempt to
manage the vastness of the new Roman world: the colonists, many of whom would
originally have been Roman, are envisaged to have a privileged relationship with
Rome, but the communities in which they live are imagined as independent. This is
the sor t of conceptual leap upon which changing ideas of the Roman citizenship, and
Roman identity itself, will be based.
While it may be that the idea of sacred space bounded by water is ver y ancient, it
may be no accident that the earliest Roman notices suggesting the application of this
idea to peninsular Italy refer to the third centur y. Huge boundaries are thereby set for
the potential ef ficacy of Roman ritual practice (Diod. 27.2; Livy 28.38.12; cf.
28.44.11; Dio fr. 57.52; Catalano 1978; M. Crawford 1990). This highly proprietor
ial expression of what Italy means is only strengthened by the apparently new practice
of reporting prodigies, signs of disturbance to be expiated by Roman ritual practice,
from Latin areas in the late third centur y and from allied territories by the end of the
second (Bradley 2000: 194). Such indications should really be thought about in
connection with modern discussions about the distinctive nature of Roman rule.
Nicolet has proposed that we should begin only in the Augustan age to think about
empire as `a territorial state', suggesting that emphasis on the control of physical
space on a vast scale is a new phenomenon (1991: 1±2; cf. the slightly earlier
chronology of Richardson 1991). And yet the Roman conquest of Italy in general
was emphatically directed not only towards the subjugation of peoples but towards
the transformation of land on ultimately a ver y large scale. In other words, it fits
306 Emma Dench



Nicolet's definition of the `territorial state' of the Roman Empire, while predating the
Augustan age by several centuries (Purcell 1990a; 1990b).
If early hints of an interest specifically in the refiguration of the land of conquered
peoples can already be obser ved in M.' Curius Dentatus' conquest of the Sabines, two
major examples taken from the next decades begin to suggest the beginnings of an
idea of Italy as a whole, a whole which can be redrawn according to a pattern
determined by the Romans. One is the building of a network of huge, permanent
roads, all leading outwards from the city, in the course of the third and into the second
centur y. The building of roads is apparently closely connected to the foundation of
colonies: a consideration of the dates of Latin colonies suggests a sense of symmetr y
and balance which seems to imply an overall vision of Italy, and a will to refigure the
landscape, both in terms of large-scale geography, and in terms of the redistribution of
land in the territor y of the colony itself, through confiscation, centuriation and
redistribution. The roads themselves alter forever the sense of ways in which individ
ual areas interconnect, while defying what would seem to be topographical con
straints, such as rivers and even mountains (Chevallier 1976; Pasquinucci 1985;
Coarelli 1988; Laurence 1999; Cur ti et al. 1996). There are some limited compari
sons to be drawn here with the `Royal Road' of the Achaimenid Empire, at least in
terms of the impression and impressiveness of drawing a vast line that refigures the
connections between ethnically diverse peoples and symbolizes in a ver y visible way
the power of the rulers (Briant 1996: 67±82; Purcell 1990a; 1990b). A second major
example is that of the resettlement of populations in the third and second centuries:
for example, in 269, Picentes were moved to the territor y just outside Paestum. It is
hard to overestimate both the impact of the rearrangement of huge numbers of
people and the will behind the impulse to do this (Cur ti et al. 1996: 187).
While Italy is not traditionally considered within the context of discussions of the
`provincialization' of space in the Roman empire, in some ways transformations of
Italian land from the third centur y are in fact a paradigm for what will become a
distinctively Roman emphasis on the reorganization of space in the Roman empire. It
is the intimacy of the relationship of Italy to Rome that both determines the intensity
of Roman inter vention at this early date, and which has often deterred us from
discussing these events within the context of the distinctive character of Roman rule.
I have so far emphasized, even at the risk of over-emphasizing, the deliberate nature
of the Roman conquest and the profound consequences it had on the reconfiguration
of peoples and lands in Italy. In doing so, I take a line rather dif ferent from that of
much recent scholarship on `Romanization' and the creation of empire which, as we
saw above, tends to emphasize local initiative in change at all levels, minimizing the
ef fects of power-relations and institutional structures which need to be taken into
account, even if the especially permeable nature of the Roman citizenship meant that,
for some, crossing line was a much greater possibility than it was in any other ancient
Mediterranean society after the archaic period.
To conclude this chapter, I will consider briefly what happens to local identities in
Italy and Sicily as a result first of the processes of conquest and alliance and ultimately
through being of fered and accepting grants of the citizenship. On the more trad
itional view, distinctive local cultural identities, and, by implication, a sense of indi
vidual local identity, begins to `disappear' from the Roman conquest, and this process
escalates rapidly after the enfranchisement of Italy in the 80s B C . In its starkest
Italy and Sicily in the Hellenistic Age 307



versions, this `disappearance' is interpreted as a by-product of `becoming Roman', the
process of beginning to look to Rome and aspire to the citizenship (Br unt 1965;
Toynbee 1965: I.93; cf. Mouritsen 1998 for a systematic critique). We should
perhaps star t by obser ving some distinctions between the third and second centur y
on the one hand and the first centur y on the other, rather than imagining a continu
ous process of cultural `Romanization'. It is in the second centur y that scholars begin
to trace especially in central and south-central Italy the flourishing of what appears to
be common architectural aspirations, especially temple and theatre complexes that
seem to hint at shared urban ideals. Despite a degree of homogeneity, such ideals are
interpreted ver y dif ferently within dif ferent local cultures, and even methods of
building can var y a great deal (La Regina 1976; Morel 1976). While in the course
of the second centur y, we can obser ve some adoption by non-Roman, non-Latin
peoples of distinctively Roman culture, such as Latin loan-words (Campanile 1979),
it is the great Hellenistic cities of the Eastern Mediter ranean that seem to be the most
obvious cultural reference-points. None of this is to deny the profound ef fects of the
Roman conquest on local dynamics and identities. One striking example is to be
found in the foundation of the Latin colony of Luceria founded on the borders of
Samnium and Apulia in the late four th centur y. The celebration there of the `Trojan'
cult of Athena Ilias renewed and reinterpreted an older asser tion in Daunian culture
of descent from the Greek hero Diomedes, associated with the `Palladian' cult of
Athena, and emphasized strong `family' links with the Romans, friends to the Dau
nians against their common Samnite enemies (Torelli 1999: 172). Specifically local
`roots' asser ted in mythological terms, perhaps the most profound way of expressing
identity in the ancient world, are subtly reconfigured by the Roman conquest, but
remain peculiarly local.
The cultural, but more par ticularly the political orientation of first-centur y Italy is
rather dif ferent. The profound ef fects of enfranchisement and political incorporation
on local communities are to be found manifested in numerous areas towards the
middle of the centur y. While Italians must go to Rome to vote for laws and magis
trates, to exercise magistracies, or to benefit from food-doles, incorporation within
the Roman state has a marked ef fect on the physical appearance of individual com
munities, and above all in the configuration of local identities: perhaps the greatest
irony of what is often described as the `unification' of Italy is the ef fect that it has on
distinctive local identities, dynamics and rivalries. One example is the sense of com
petitive pride taken in statuses granted by Rome, most notably those ofmunicipium
and colonia; this seems to be par ticularly marked in the towns of the nor th, the most
newly Roman communities of the late Republic (Rudd 1959; W iseman 1985; Cen
erini 1989; Criniti 1994). Another is the creation of space within urban communities
such as Alba Fucens, Herdonia and Pompeii, in the campus, the Latin equivalent to
the gymnasium, for honours granted to individual Roman patrons (Torelli 1991). In
areas such as the remoter par ts of the Central Apennines, where urban ideals had
hither to had least impact, there are clear signs of real changes simultaneously in elite
behaviour and in the ver y fabric of communities, at the same time as some individuals
begin to aspire to a political life at Rome, in the increasing use of wealth in more
`private' contexts, and in the building of baths and aqueducts (J. Patterson 1991;
Dench 1995: 140±53). It was per fectly possible to look simultaneously to Rome and
to the local environment, as is illustrated by the inscription dedicated by the people of
308 Emma Dench



Superaequum to their patron Q. Varius Geminus, `the first of all the Paelignians to
become a senator' (ILS 932).
It is surely not a coincidence that the end of the Republic and the first centur y of
the Empire is the period when an interest in Italian local origins and histories is most
noticeable. One does not necessarily have to imagine that what we see is the `inven
tion of tradition' from scratch in order to recognize significant contemporar y
impulses, above all that of reasser ting distinctive local identities in a newly Roman
world as well as that of renegotiating Roman identity in a newly Italian world. Earlier
experiments in thinking about Roman identity as a plural entity, via the myth of the
rape of the Sabine women, the formulation of Graecus ritus, or the expandable blood
relationship of Latins (Thomas 1990; Scheid 1996; Arieti 1997), were much fur ther
developed in antiquarian and historical treatments of Rome's Italian roots, from
Varro's de Lingua Latina to Virgil's Aeneid (Zetzel 1997; Horsfall 1997; 2001).
The stylized variegation of the literar y topos of laudes Italiae is a rhetorical counter
part to the Augustan creation of the Italian regiones with sometimes evocative ethnic
names, such as `Sabinum et Samnium' or Etruria (Thomsen 1947; Nicolet 1991). At
a local level, two ver y dif ferent examples of the proud asser tion of local roots include
Livy's twinning of the foundation by Antenor of his native Padua with that by Aeneas
of Rome at the beginning of his histor y, and the so-called Elogia of Etruscan
Tarquinii, relating episodes of a pre-Roman independent past, that seem studiously
not to mention Rome (Torelli 1975; Laurence 1998a: 104±6). Perhaps the most
obvious case of a distinctive local identity that seems to have been deliberately
fostered by Rome is that of Neapolis, proudly Greek, but Greek in ways only
imaginable in the context of being par t of the Roman state, well into the imperial
period (M. Crawford 1978; Lomas 1997). These treatments coexist with flatter
treatments of the making of Roman identity, such as Cicero's formulation of dual
identity in his de Legibus (2.2.5), and Velleius Paterculus' narrative of `Roman Italy' as
a long and continuous process of incorporation, interrupted only by the Social War
(Gabba 1973: 347f f.).
A traditional narrative of ancient Italy would end with Augustus' emphasis on the
suppor t of tota Italia (`the whole of Italy') for his leadership against an increasingly
`orientalized' Antony (RG 25). While the Battle of Actium and the Egyptian war
formally mark the end of the Hellenistic period, the individual local histories of Italy
are, as I have tried to show, by no means over, while the histor y of Roman Italy is
inextricably linked to the histor y of the Roman Empire. As we have seen, the past, an
increasingly complex amalgam of archaic, classical, Hellenistic and more recent
motifs, continued to be understood as a remarkably rich repositor y of exempla, its
cultural and geographical emphases shifting in dif ferent contexts. Almost as soon as
distinctively Roman ideas about Italy began to be formulated in the third, second and
first centuries B C , these in turn were used as precedents for the understanding and
organization of territories and peoples overseas (Giardina 1994, cf. Gabba 1978).
While the Emperor Claudius' insistence that extending the Roman citizenship on the
other side of the Alps was nothing more than the continuation of a process as old as
the city of Rome itself was, to put it kindly, a selective view of histor y, but there is no
doubt that Roman experience in Italy encouraged the development of the distinct
ively plural shape of the Roman Empire, with its ultimately vast, multi-ethnic citizen
ship (CIL 13.1988; cf. Tac. Ann 11.23±5).

FURTHER READING
There is a rapidly expanding English-language bibliography on Hellenistic Italy and
Sicily that for tunately includes some translated work, but few general over views.
Pallottino 1991 exemplifies some of the methodological problems in attempting to
write an `Italic' histor y, while J.-M. David 1996 is rather Romanocentric. Mouritsen
1998 is a useful antidote to the latter work. Despite the organizational problems
mentioned in this chapter, the new edition of the Cambridge Ancient Histor y has
some excellent individual essays (NB Purcell 1994, Cornell 1989, M. Crawford
1996). Torelli 1991, concentrating on the period of the Roman conquest, begins
to show those who do not read Italian something of what they might be missing: the
historical readings of material culture are par ticularly striking.
Monographs in English on individual peoples, var ying in chronological focus,
perspective and the kinds of evidence privileged, include: Salmon 1967; W. Harris
1971, Frederiksen 1984; Spivey and Stoddar t 1990; Ross Holloway 1991; Lomas
1993; Dench 1995; Bradley 2000.
For those who want to go further, Italian and French are indispensable, and
bibliography of the major players can be chased via essays in the Cambridge Ancient
Histor y, the more recent monographs listed above, or Curti et al. 1996. Classic,
paradigm-shifting collections of generally excellent essays include: P. Zanker 1976,
Modes de contact 1983, Mertens and Lambrechts 1991. The Longanesi series of
archaeological monographs on individual Italian peoples gives an idea of the distinct
ive emphases of Italian scholars: excellent volumes include those of Tagliamonte on
the Samnites (1996), Guzzo on the Bruttians (1989), and Greco Pontrandolfo on
the Lucanians (1982). For those who have the oppor tunity to visit sites and museums
in Italy, the Guide Archeologiche Laterza series, divided into volumes by modern
regions, is indispensable, and includes some classics that are of themselves scholarly
works, e.g. Coarelli and La Regina (1984) on Abruzzo and Molise (the area that
includes ancient Samnium).

CHAPTER NINETEEN
Family Structures
Riet van Bremen
The interest of the family group overr uling that of the individual is a historical constant
until recent times. (VÂ erilhac and Vial 1998: 375)
There are dif ferent ways of approaching the concept of family str uctures. The major
role played by kinship in the organization of Hellenistic cities, and the per vasiveness
of what may be called `family-thinking' in civic self-representation and in the collect
ive mentality of those who lived in cities, are str uctural to society in a dif ferent sense
from the `str uctural' that is concer ned with demography, with the size of households
and the shape of kinship groups, or with marriage and inheritance patterns. It is with
the for mer, and with the connection between what is conventionally called the
`private' and the `public' that this chapter will be largely concer ned, although one
of its themes will be that of the impact of changes in the wider, political, world, upon
the nature of the family group and its individual members. It will take as its focus the
world of the cities, because it is here, in the cities of Greece, the Aegean islands, and
western Asia Minor, that a reasonably coherent body of evidence exists and some level
of generalization about developments is possible. It is also here that some of the more
interesting tensions emerged between the Hellenistic world's two main organiza
tional and representational systems: that of dynastically-orientated monarchies and
equality-orientated civic communities.

1 Civic Endogamy: the Case of Latmos and Pidasa
Sometime in the years between 323 and 313 BC
, the two cities of Latmos and Pidasa
in Karia, in western Asia Minor, entered into a sympoliteia: a union of their commu
nities. The treaty, ratified by an oath and inscribed in stone, sur vives vir tually intact
(Blu È mel 1997; C. Jones 1999a, cf. figure 19.1). Of the two cities, Latmos was the
larger, situated at the foot of the mountain of the same name. The centre of Pidasa,

: (line 3) The of ficials should also immediately lay on a sacrifice so that
the city may live in harmony. (4)A new
phyle
should be added to the existing ones and it should
be named Asandris. Men from all the
phylai
and
phratoria
in Latmos and in (8)Pidasa should be
allocated to it by lot. And the remaining Pidaseans should be allocated to the remaining (three)
phylai
as evenly as possible. The Pidaseans who have been so distributed should be allowed to
par take in all cultic activities: as members of the
phratoriai
in the cultic activities of the
phratoriai
, (12)and as members of the
phylai
in the cultic activities of the
phylai
, to whichever
one they have been allocated. And the revenue which accr ues to the Pidaseans and Latmians,
from sacred or other sources, they are to have in common, (16)and there is not to be any
separate income for either of the cities. And the debts which exist in either city until the month
of Dios are to be settled separately by each of the (cities). And the Latmians should provide for
the (20)Pidaseans suf ficient living and stabling accommodation for a period of one year. And so
that they will also intermarr y with one another it will not be permitted to a Latmian to give a
daughter to a Latmian nor to take (from him), and for a Pidasean (to give) to a Pidasean [or
take from him], (24)but a Latmian must give to and take from a Pidasean and a Pidasean to and

whose territor y adjoined that of Latmos to the south, was located in Mt. Grion,
above the road that runs south-east from Miletos, towards Euromos and Mylasa. We
do not know the name of the newly formed community, but it is clear from the treaty
that Latmos was the dominant par tner. Soon after, towards the ver y end of the four th
centur y, Latmos was refounded as Herakleia (by Latmos) on a site half a kilometre
fur ther east, probably by the Macedonian king Antigonos Monophthalmos. At this
time the new city may still have consisted of Latmo-Pidaseans but we know that in the
longer term the arrangement was not successful: the Pidaseans left the union some
time in the early third centur y. Pidasa continued to exist under its own name for more
than a centur y, until it was integrated into neighbouring Miletos in the early second
centur y B C in another ± well-documented ± sympoliteia (Milet I.3, no 149; translation
and bibliography in Milet VI.1, 184±5; Gauthier 2001).
The union of Latmos and Pidasa was imposed by a higher authority, the satrap of
Karia, Asandros whose allegiance at this time was to Antigonos Monophthalmos. His
name is attached to the new phyle, Asandris, which the Latmians added to their
existing three phylai. The treaty contains arrangements for the redistribution of
citizens of both cities into the four phylai. It deals with the entitlements of the
newly constituted citizen body, with the sharing of income, the setting up of joint
boards of magistrates, and with arrangements for the Latmians to provide housing
and stables for Pidaseans for the duration of a year. It is also concerned with the
mixing of the two citizen bodies into one, for the purpose of which two extraordinar y
measures are taken: a rigorous, six-year prohibition of civic endogamy and a concomi
tant obligation to marr y exclusively someone from the other city. (In describing eight
separate permutations of daughter-giving-and-taking the Greek text manages to use
the word thugater, `daughter', only once, thus leaving no doubt about the male focus
of the transaction):
and so that they will also intermarr y with one another (epigamias poieisthai) it will not be
permitted to a Latmian to give a daughter to a Latmian nor to take (from him), and for a
Pidasean (to give) to a Pidasean [or take from him], but a Latmian must give to and take
from a Pidasean and a Pidasean to and from a Latmian for a period of six years. (ll. 22±5)
This rather striking example of ancient social engineering, for which so far no parallels
exist, has been described as `breaking with the old par ticularisms' (Gauthier, BE
1999, no. 462), implying that what we see here, at the ver y beginning of the
Hellenistic period, is a new development, which runs counter to established struc
tures and mentalities. But does it?
from a Latmian for a period of six years. And the magistracies must be filled from both
Latmians and Pidaseans. It will be permitted to the Pidaseans to build houses (28)in the city
on the common land wherever they wish. And one hundred Pidasean men, as designated by the
Latmians, and two hundred Latmians as designated by the Pidaseans, are to swear an oath over
a bull and a boar in the marketplace (32)to abide by this decree and this constitution. And the
decree will be inscribed on stone stelai of which one is to be set up in the sanctuar y of Zeus at
Labraunda, and one in Latmos in the sanctuar y of Athena. (36)The of ficials who are allocated
to Aropus must take care of the arrangements. The oath which the Latmians are to swear: `I
swear by Zeus, Ge, Helios, Poseidon, Athena Areia and (Ar temis) Tauropolos and the other
gods. I will share citizenship with the Pidaseans.. . . '
Family Structures 315



Both civic endogamy and epigamia emerged from the structural, underlying,
connection that existed in Greek cities between private kinship networks and political
organization. If, fundamentally, marriage was an arrangement concerning two house
holds, and a contract concluded between two individual men (a woman's father and
his prospective son-in-law), it was also communal and political in the sense that it
was through marriage that legitimate citizenship was continued and guaranteed and
through af filiation in the male line that membership of a city's constituent bodies was
perpetuated. This structural continuum between the individual/private (idion) and
the communal/civic (politikon) developed in the course of the archaic and Classical
periods and became one of the most fundamental characteristics of the Classical city.
The Pidasa/Latmos treaty shows clearly the various networks that linked individuals
with one another and with their city. Phylai (usually translated as `tribes') and
phratoriai (`brotherhoods') were organizational subdivisions of male citizens
through which political activity was channelled and political status secured. The
legitimacy of citizen status, and all the rights and obligations that adhered to it
were closely linked to membership of a phyle and to further social subdivisions
which formed the link between the private and the public: in this case phratoriai;
elsewhere we hear of syngeneiai, patrai, etc. Units like these, taking their name from
kinship terminology ± though not necessarily based on real kinship groups ± coexisted
with other, numerically constituted ones (e.g. chiliastyes: `thousands') and with
geographical units like demes (N. Jones 1987).
The ancient Greek citizen body was a closed community, with strict rules as to who
was `in' and who was `out'. The connection between marriage and citizenship was
carefully guarded and exclusive: only from a marriage between two citizens could
legitimate children be born. In most cities, citizen descent going back one generation
on both father's and mother's side had been a requirement of full citizenship at least
from the early fourth centur y onwards (in some, a three-generation rule existed for
cer tain magistracies and priesthoods). In practice, therefore, a system of civic endog
amy (`in-marr ying') prevailed, and although marr ying outside one's community was
never prohibited, doing so drastically altered one's status. Under normal circum
stances, the son of a Latmian man and a Pidasean woman would have been without
full citizen rights: in Latmos his status would have been that of nothos (bastard). In
the same city, the son of a Latmian mother and a Pidasean father would have had
the status of foreigner (xenos) or resident foreigner (metoikos, paroikos), for the son's
status was derived primarily from that of the father. The prohibition of civic endo
gamy in the Latmos±Pidasa treaty, therefore, appears, at first sight, to be an inversion
of the normal situation.
Epigamia, too, is a device familiar from across the Greek world; it enabled cities to
arrange the necessar y or desirable incorporation of outsiders into the civic community
but without losing control of the principles that governed its basic structures. Along
with other rights adhering to citizenship it might be granted en bloc to citizens who
had entered into a shared, new, politeuma, as we saw above, or in a mutual gesture of
exchange, to cities that were members of the same larger federation (such as the
Aitolian League) or, as an integral right, to individuals to whom citizenship of a city
other than their own had been awarded as a par ticular favour or as par t of a special
arrangement between two communities. In all these cases, epigamia was granted as a
right; never, as far as we know, was it used as a mechanism of enforcement as in the
316 Riet van Bremen



case of Latmos and Pidasa. It could therefore be claimed that, in this respect too, we
see a depar ture from the normal situation.
We cannot generalize from this unique case, nor even be cer tain that the forced
mixing of these two communities was typical of new-style autocratic inter ference
rather than the brainchild of the two communities themselves. If the former, as is
cer tainly possible, then it is only in this, the autocratic enforcing, that the novelty of
the situation lies, not in the mechanisms used. Both the prohibition on civicendoga
mia and the encouraging of epigamia can be seen as variations on an existing mode of
thinking about the interrelation between family and city, as temporar y `adjustments'
in an extraordinar y situation, but using existing devices rather than depar ting from
established principles. There is ever y reason to think that after the six-year period, the
situation was meant to rever t back to normal and the usual, exclusive, rules of civic
endogamy would once more apply, though now within a newly-mixed and redefined
citizen-body of Latmo-Pidaseans (Herakleians?). Therefore, in the end, no funda
mental principles or par ticularisms were violated and no dif ferent structures invented.
2 Changes?
Even so, given the date of the treaty, it must be asked whether the par ticularist
principles underlying the union of Pidasa and Latmos belonged squarely in the
`old' world of the Classical polis, even perhaps at the tail-end of the latter's evolution,
or whether they continued to be characteristic of cities in the `new' Hellenistic world.
The question is relevant in the context of this chapter: it has often been argued that in
the Hellenistic period the old structures and cer tainties of the Classical polis
weakened, and that this process profoundly affected the status of individuals as
members of families and, by extension, the dynamics of the family itself. Several
recent studies of Hellenistic families star t from this position, and it can be found
also in studies of Hellenistic women. At its core is the idea that Hellenistic society
under went fundamental changes as a result of large-scale migration whose ef fects are
commonly referred to as `deracination': in the wake of Alexander's campaigns and the
wars fought by the Successors, hundreds of thousands of men, ex-soldiers and others,
settled in newly conquered territories and in newly founded cities. `Older' cities were
depleted of men and needed to recruit new citizens. Emigration and settlement in
foreign territor y had the ef fect of `severing people both from their forebears and their
descendants', as one historian has put it. Emigrants were thus `not only separated
from (their) blood relations but could scarcely pretend to be a member of long
established ar tificial kinship groups' (Pomeroy 1997b: 108±9). The result was a
weakening of the `old' family-ties and `old' polis-structures, `major changes in the
relationship between oikos and polis', and the invention of new, more flexible, family
structures (in par ticular, the loosening of the principle of transmitting status and
wealth through the male line, giving more weight to cognatic links and more scope to
women for wielding influence and using their own wealth: Pomeroy 1997b: 109±12;
1997a: 205).
Parallel to this, and par tly for the same reasons, that well-known ancient condition,
`Hellenistic individualism' is said to have developed. `This was a world in which it was
often more impor tant to be an anthropos than a polites' is how one recent study of the
Greek family sums up the idea that the bringing of cities under monarchic rule and
Family Structures 317



the wider perspective of the new monarchies ser ved to loosen the individual's ties
with his polis, changing his citizen-perspective to a more cosmopolitan one while at
the same time focusing his immediate attention on the domestic sphere and on
personal relationships (C. Patterson 1998: 191; cf. also e.g. Shipley 2000: 105±6).
The new societal structures that are said to have developed as a result of these forces
are supposed also to have caused a weakening of authority within families, and
allowed women to be treated as individuals and as capable of owning and disposing
of proper ty in their own right, often dispensing with the control of a male kyrios or
tutor: by almost general consensus, the position and status of women `improved' in
this period, while that of their male tutors declined.
While some of these developments are undeniably characteristic of the Hellenistic
period, it is extremely difficult to use them to underpin broad generalizations, linking
what may in fact be quite separate phenomena into one apparently ± and satisfyingly ±
logical sequence, into which isolated obser vations can then be inser ted and
`explained' as par t of the same causal chain. One of the most obviously characteristic
features of the Hellenistic period is cer tainly the large-scale movement, during the
first half of the third centur y, of Macedonians and Greeks from the `old' cities across
the newly conquered territories, as soldiers or as settlers, or both. So, indeed, is the
foundation of large numbers of new cities on the model of the old, across Asia Minor
and the Near East. But while some scholars have emphasized the estranging ef fects
which this dispersion had on individuals, others have instead seen a increasing
structural and cultural homogeneity and a surge in `connectivity' between Greek
cities old and new, as a main feature of the Hellenistic world (e.g. Billows, this
volume).
How to assess the ef fects on the fundamental connection between individual,
family and city of developments seemingly pulling in dif ferent directions? One
could put it flippantly, though not entirely unseriously: how many deracinated Greeks
did it take to change the basic structures of a polis, or to change the collective
memories and mentalities that determined communal and individual actions, and
how many new poleis did it take to counter the trend? Were all cities af fected equally
or some more than others? Was the sense of being uprooted equally strong if one
settled as a Cretan in Miletos, a Macedonian in Egypt, or a Thessalian in fur thest
Baktria? The answer to the last question has to be no. Acculturation was more
problematic, and adaptation and change more necessar y ± or more likely to be
resisted, or more likely to fail: the possible permutations are many ± the greater
the cultural distance between settlers and natives and the greater the structural
dif ference between the kind of communities in which each group had been used to
organizing itself.
A recently published inscription documenting a new city foundation in a remote
par t of Phr ygia shows that new-polis-packages came with all the familiar ingredients
including the traditional subdivisions of the citizen body, and with laws that con
formed to Greek norms:
Submit (your laws) to us, so that we may inspect them for anything contrar y to your
interests; if (you are not satisfied with them) let us know and we shall send you the laws
capable of setting up both the council and the magistrates, of distributing the people and
assigning them to phylai, and of building a gymnasium and providing oil for the neoi.

and Ric Ë l 1997;
SEG
47.1745; BD 43)
Familiar, or deceptively familiar? Were recognizable Greek institutions, laws and
terminologies merely a veneer, overlying dif ferent indigenous structures and
customs? Did they hide fundamental changes within the families that made up
these new citizen bodies? More often than not, we cannot tell. The insurmountable
problem in the case of most new cities is that we simply do not have the evidence to
investigate ± on either the public or the private level ± the dynamics of the civic
communities that were created or the implications of acculturation of settlers and
natives during the first few centuries of their existence.
Those postulating changes in the dynamics of family relationships in this period are
therefore in practice limited to taking their evidence from two better documented
contexts: Ptolemaic Egypt, and the cities of Greece, western Asia Minor and the
Aegean islands. The implications of this limitation need to be clearly spelled out. In
Egypt, many tens of thousands of Macedonians and Greeks settled in small groups
dispersed over the countr yside (the
chora
), mostly in villages and alongside native
Egyptians. Dif ferences between Egyptians and settlers were considerable in many
aspects of life, and there is evidence both of conflict and of selective adaptation and
adoption of Egyptian customs by Greek settlers and
vice versa
. Intermarriage between
Greeks and Egyptians was more frequent in the second centur y than in the third,
more common in the
chora
than in the
metropoleis
, and among the lower social classes
than among the elites: within the latter, Greek tended to marr y Greek. Not surpris
ingly, when thus thrown together, Greeks from dif ferent backgrounds attempted to
settle through personal contracts what the laws of their respective cities had once
regulated and super vised. Thus, marriage contracts (of which no more than a handful
sur vive in any detail), and other documents on papyr us illustrating the private and
communal arrangements between Greeks, and between Greeks and Egyptians, show
both adherence to common Greek practice and deviations from the old and the
accustomed. Here, obviously, `major changes in the relationship between
oikos
and
polis
' occurred, because the framework of the
polis
itself was largely absent (so already
Wolf f 1939: 82). It is much less easy than is sometimes suggested, however, to detect
subsequent developments, such as, e.g. the postulated weakening of male authority
within families or changes in inheritance patterns. Significant though this evidence is
in showing the circumstances that prevailed in the Egyptian
chora
(and occasionally in
the new
metropoleis
), we cannot easily generalize from it beyond the specific Egyptian
context, (Vatin 1970: chapter 4; Ogden 1996: chapters 13 and 14; V Âe rilhac and Vial
1998: chapters 1 and 5; Rowlandson 1998: chapters 3 and 4).
It is in the cities of the `old' Greek world: those in Greece, the islands, and western
Asia Minor, that questions about changes to the basic structures of civic and familial
organization acquire some meaning. But even here much of the evidence is indirect,
dispersed and fragmentar y, and often hard to fit into a sequence of cause and ef fect. It
is salutar y to realize, for instance, that in the case of Cretans in Miletos, briefly alluded
to above, we have one of the ver y few documented examples of
groups
of emigrants
making their home in another Greek city. At the end of the third centur y BC
(in 234/
3 and 229/8) large groups of Cretan soldiers were persuaded by the Milesians to
come to their city in order to provide militar y assistance. There were possibly about
Family Structures
319



1000 men in total, though only about 400 names sur vive; 78 men are accompanied
by `families' of some description. Upon the Cretans' request, and after the Milesians
had consulted the oracle at Didyma, they were naturalized as Milesian citizens, given
land in Milesian territor y (or rather in the territor y of a small neighbouring
polis
,
Myous, which had been absorbed by Miletos in a
sympoliteia
) and integrated into the
existing str uctures of Miletos, in many cases together with their families. Lists of their
names sur vive, inscribed together with the decrees, on one of the walls of the
sanctuar y of Apollo Delphinios (
Milet
I.3, 33±8; discussion pp. 166±203).
Here one might legitimately ask what, if any, ef fects `deracination' would have had
on a str uctural level. There is nothing to suggest that these men and their families,
once naturalized, would have had any option other than to conform to the laws and
customs of the Milesians (which might not in any case have str uck them as ver y
dif ferent from their own). Would they have felt the need to create more `flexible'
family str uctures or even been able to do so, while fully subject to the laws of the
Milesians? Unusually, we have some information about our Cretans some thir ty years
after their naturalization. When in 201 BC
, the Macedonian king Philip V forced the
Milesians to give up Myous, granting the latter with its territor y to the neighbouring
city of Magnesia, the `Cretans' suddenly found themselves without the land on which
they had been settled, or rather with a citizen-status that no longer fitted that of their
land. The Magnesians attempted to repatriate the naturalized soldiers to Crete.
A decree of one of their home cities, Gor tyn, refusing repatriation, sur vives (
IC
4.176, ll. 34±8 with W. Gu È nther 1988: 393±6). What we can tentatively conclude
from this is that, one generation on, the Cretans still apparently formed a separate
community within the larger Milesian state, and had not intermarried with `real'
Milesians to any significant extent: the Milesian citizen body was still predominantly a
family of citizens into which groups of outsiders, even when naturalized, were
integrated but slowly if at all. If this conclusion has any validity, might a fur ther
hypothesis be that during their first few decades in Miletos the Cretans resor ted to
practising close-kin endogamy within their own community either from choice or
from necessity? Or to marr ying
metoikoi
resident in Miletos, thus producing of fspring
that would not have had full citizen status? These are possible strategies that might, in
the longer term, have af fected the character of the Milesian citizen body. But answers
are not for thcoming. Given such a level of ignorance even here, in one of the better
documented cities of the Hellenistic world, it would be rash to want to put for ward
any fur ther hypotheses about weakening of family ties or other changes in family
behaviour as a result of migrator y movements.
There is much evidence to show that, within the cities themselves, rather than a
weakening of the continuum between `old' family-ties and `old'
polis
-str uctures, there
was a continuation or even a reinforcing of the essential relationship between the two
spheres throughout much of the Hellenistic period. Several recent studies all empha
size the persistence, continuity and vitality of the `old' str uctures rather than their
instant demise (Gauthier 1972a and 1988; Savalli 1985; N. Jones 1987; V Âe rilhac and
Vial 1998: chapter 2). When, more than a hundred years after their failed
sympoliteia
with the Latmians, in the early 180s BC
, the Pidaseans were integrated into the
Milesian citizen body, the decree ratifying the
sympoliteia
stipulated that `the Pida
seans will be citizens of the Milesians, together with their children and their wives,
insofar as the latter are Pidasean by bir th, or citizens of a Greek city' (
Milet
I.3, no.
320
Riet van Bremen



149, ll. 10±12, translated in
Milet
VI.1, 184±5). The concession concerning the
wives' citizen status
appears
to imply Pidasean disregard for the `two-parent' r ule.
One could imagine it fitting per fectly in an argument about the loosening of
polis
str uctures. But that the concession, and the practices underlying it, were exceptional,
is emphasized in a recent study (VÂ erilhac and Vial 1998) in which Pidasa is discussed
as one of only two known Hellenistic cities which `practised exogamy'. The unusual
stipulation is sometimes explained as a blanket exclusion of Karian spouses (Miletos
was on the edge of Karia, Pidasa in origin a Karian community), but this does not ring
tr ue at a time when civic identity had long superseded ethnic identity, and the fact
that the earlier
sympoliteia
does not appear to be similarly concerned with `barbaric'
elements within the Pidasean citizen body fur ther undermines this explanation. Given
its ver y small size, and its evident histor y of negotiations with several larger neigh
bouring cities, it is more likely than not that the Pidaseans had over the years entered
into
epigamia
arrangements with neighbours which had resulted in non-Pidasean
wives being married and domiciled in Pidasa. Even if the children of these unions
were legitimate under the specific arrangements of one
epigamia
arrangement, their
privileges were not valid in Miletos, and a special case had to be made.
What this example shows first of all is the ver y great care the Milesians took to define
precisely the dif ferent kinship relationships that were acceptable and those that were
not. The principle of civic membership through male filiation was not abandoned.
Secondly, small, landlocked Pidasa's status as an `exogamous' city (the other known
case is the equally small and landlocked city of Euaimon in Arkadia) can only be
explained if we realize that the kind of circumstances that led to this `habit' of civic
exogamy were specific and local. In suppor t of this, we need only to look at large
commercial cities like Miletos itself, or Rhodes, or Alexandria, or to the commercial
centre that was the small island of Delos, all of which had substantial populations of
foreigners (`immigrants' of a dif ferent kind), both resident and temporar y, but at the
same time, and ver y likely because of the size of the non-citizen population, took some
care to preser ve the principle of civic endogamy throughout the Hellenistic period.
The overall increase in numbers of resident foreigners in places like these (among
whom resident Romans became an impor tant group from the second centur y
onwards) and the juxtaposition of a closed (even if not impermeable), privileged
citizen body with a large group of non-citizen residents is an interesting phenomenon
in its own right ± to which no justice can be done in a brief chapter ± and one which,
within the large and interconnected economies of the Hellenistic kingdoms cer tainly
became more common than it had been in the Classical period. The elaborate
organizational str uctures (called
koina
) that were developed, for instance, by the
metic population on Rhodes, were
sui generis
, and are the more interesting for
being modelled on the
polis
in many of their aspects (Gabrielsen 1997: chapter 5).
Even more interesting are the connections (economic, social, religious) that de
veloped between these associations and members of the Rhodian elite. But it was
only here, in large commercial centres like Rhodes, that intermarriage between
Greeks from dif ferent cities became a major factor and anything like a non-citizen
population suf ficiently large to star t creating its own social organizations developed,
thus, if not directly undermining, at least contributing to changes in the str ucture of
the Rhodian state. In most other cities, the size of the metic and foreign population
was substantially smaller and it is doubtful whether it was ever substantial enough to

3 The Civic Family
In H ellenistic cities divi sions within the famil y exte nded into the pub lic sphe re. The
ideolog y of equality and solidarity , whi ch d ominated male civic behaviour and which
emerged from a polit ical tradi tion that gave a cent ral decisi on-ma king role to the
assembly of male citi zens, strongly af fect ed the pub lic
personae o f wom en and the
young. In the public sphere hous eholds re- grouped the mselves along lines of gende r
and age , for ming in a cer tain sense a collecti ve family of citi zens. For civi c purpos es,
families dissolv ed into colle ctives of men (
neoi : young men, for med a separ ate and
impor tant grou p), wome n (refer red to as
gynaikes or
politides ), boys of dif ferent ages
(
paides : young boys,
epheboi : boys in their uppe r te ens) and unma r ried gi rls (
par the
noi ). This fu nctional separ ation af fected of fice-holding , includ ing religio us of fice
holdin g, and gave str uctu re to civi c and religio us ritua l a nd to the accultur ation and
education of (future) c itizens. The princip le of it is we ll sh own in the following
passage from an inscript ion of Halika r nassos (
SIG3 1015,
LSAM 73) but it could
be illust rated from many othe r public document s:
He who buys the priesthood of Ar temis Pergaia has to provide a priestess who is a citizen
woman of citizen descent (
aste ex asto Ãn ) over three generations and on both father's and
mother's side. She who buys it is to be priestess for life and is to per for m both public and
private sacrifices. . . . (14) The treasurers are to give to the pr ytaneis 30 drachmas for the
public sacrifice to Ar temis. The sacrifice is to be prepared by the wives of the pr ytaneis,
having taken what has been given from the polis. She (the priestess) is to per for m the
sacrifice in the month of Herakleios on the twelfth. And she is to receive the same
por tion of the sacrificial victims as the wives of the pr ytaneis in the case of the victims
sacrificed publicly . (

the priestess: essential is that they carr y out their role in the ritual as par t of the
collective of women; in no way are they linked in their activities to their husbands,
even if their status and privileges are derived from the latter's position; for public
purposes they are autonomous, just as the collective of citizen wives had a separate
identity from that of their citizen husbands. In understanding public±private relations
within Classical and Hellenistic Greek cities nothing could be more wrong than to
say, as is commonly done, that women belonged to the domestic, or private, sphere,
and men to the public. It was inherent in Greek society from early on that there
existed a public role for women and for the young. It is par ticularly in the period after
Alexander that the development of institutions concerned with these specific sub
groups took of f (and at the same time becomes more visible to us): civic gymnasia for
paides, ephebes and neoi became central to the acculturation and training of the
young, while magistracies like the gymnasiarchia, paidonomia and gynaikonomia
developed more widely.
It is unfortunate ± though an inevitable result of the focus on women's histor y over
the past decades ± that the public regulation of women is often treated separately
from that of other civic groups. The occurrence of gynaikonomoi, (male) super visors
of female public conduct, has thus been variously described as retrogressive, an
expression of nostalgia, and typically aristocratic (Pomeroy 1997a: 214; 1997b:
63). The title of gynaikonomos is often translated, following Cicero's attempt at
explaining the magistracy in Roman terms (Rep. 4.6), as `censor of women', some
times more broadly as a `police des moeurs' (Pouilloux 1954: 407±10; Wehrli 1962)
and his role explained as concerned with the reining in of unruly women, the curbing
of `excessive display of wealth' `lavish par ties' or `overindulgence in disorderly expres
sions of grief ' (Shipley 2000: 105; Pomeroy, as above). These are interpretations that
are too narrowly conceived and too negative and stereotypical in their emphasis on
controlling female excess. The evidence, from a range of cities, and with dates ranging
from the fourth to the first centur y B C , shows the gynaikonomoi's role variously as
that of super vising female par ticipation and dress during religious ceremonies, pro
cessions, civic festivals and funerals, and, at times, super vising young girls. So for
instance in Magnesia on the Maeander, in the early second centur y B C , in a list of
prescriptions concerning the cult of Zeus Sosipolis, by decision of the people the
gynaikonomoi were to delegate nine girls and the paidonomoi nine boys to participate
in the sacrificing of a bull. In another example, from Alexandria, thegynaikonomos can
be seen testifying to a young man's citizen credentials on his mother's side (Wehrli
1962; Vatin 1970: 254±61; Ogden 1996: 364±75).
Aristotle, in the Politics, does indeed describe the gynaikonomos, together with the
paidonomos and `other magistracies exercising similar super visor y functions', as aris
tocratic, not democratic, elements in constitutions (`because the poor have to make
their wives and children work'); he also lists the gynaikonomia with the paidonomia,
nomophylakia and gymnasiarchia under the heading of magistracies that `are con
cerned with eukosmia (good order, decorum) and specific to cities that have a cer tain
amount of leisure and wealth' (Pol. 1300a4; 1322b39; 1323a4). But neither the
paidonomia nor the gymnasiarchia are ever described by modern scholars with such
value-laden terms as `retrogressive' or `nostalgic'; nor is the title of paidonomos
(identically constituted to gynaikonomos) usually translated as `censor of boys' or his
concern with boys' potential unruliness or excesses singled out. The paidonomos
Family Structures 323



super vised paides (sometimes also parthenoi), and was responsible for their public
appearances such as participating in processions or singing hymns. Thegymnasiarchos
super vised paides, ephebes and neoi in the context of the gymnasium, guarding
eukosmia by preventing any contact between the young boys and older age groups
during exercising and generally keeping undesirable individuals from entering the
premises (Austin 118; Hatzopoulos and Gauthier 1993). In our period, these magis
tracies had developed from being specific only to cer tain types of cities to being
vir tually ubiquitous and characteristic of cities' concern with acculturating the young
and with guarding the public decorum and moral integrity of those groups that were
deemed to be in need of super vision precisely because they were essential to the
integrity of the citizen body as a whole. The main point is to tr y to understand the
gynaikonomia not in isolation, but in context, as part of a general mentality and a
general regulator y and organizational system.
More than thir ty years ago, Cl. Vatin pointed out the distinction made by Cicero
between the Roman censor and the Greek gynaikonomos (and, implicitly, between the
two societies): the former's function was to `teach husbands how to rein in their
wives' while the second was truly a praefectus ± a magistrate ± of women, implicitly
criticizing Greek men for abdicating what, in Roman eyes, was the role of the
paterfamilias. But in the Greek city, in our period even more visibly and explicitly
than before, the `community of women' was a collective as was that of men, with
collective roles and duties. Vatin's obser vation that `the Ciceronian ideal was that of a
patriarchal society, composed of family units into which political power (the State)
did not inter vene directly' (1970: 260) is acute, but it needs some slight modifica
tion: seeing the Greek system as one in which the `State' interfered directly does not
do justice to the fact that there was no `State' other than that same collective of
citizen men, who jointly delegated some of their own number to be gymnasiarchs,
gynaikonomoi, paidonomoi etc., thus collectively entrusting these magistrates with
super vising the totality of their sons, daughters and wives.
4 Family Thinking and Collective Ritual
A public ordinance of Kos (dated to shor tly after 198B C ) is concerned with the sale of
the priesthood of Aphrodite Pandamos (of the entire People) and with regulations for
her cult:
So that the honours of the goddess are increased, all those of the female citizens,nothai
and resident foreigners (paroikoi) who are getting married must be seen to honour the
goddess to the best of their ability, all who are to marr y, having sworn an oath (?); and all
are to sacrifice a victim to the goddess within one year after their marriage. . . . Those who
do not sacrifice as is prescribed, are to be fined, and they owe the priestess a fine of ten
drachmas . . . (Iscr.Cos. ED 178, ll. 15±20; 24±6; cf. Dillon 1999)
This text raises issues about civic `family thinking' that are not easily discussed in a few
paragraphs. The stated aim of this section of the ordinance is that `the goddess'
honours be increased'. We might conclude from what follows in the text that this was
par tly achieved by increasing income from sacrificial animals and from fines (`she was
made richer') and in par t by enhancing her civic profile through frequently repeated
324 Riet van Bremen



acts of sacrifice (`she got more attention'). But was that really what the Koans
understood by `increasing her honours'?
We must ask what wider considerations generated these measures. Can we, in
par ticular, conclude from this ordinance that the proper sanctioning of marriages
and propitiating the right deity was a matter of collective, civic concern and thus in
need of prescriptive regulation? It has been pointed out (Parker and Obbink 2000)
that marriage rituals such as these, though commonly found in Greek cities of both
the Classical and Hellenistic periods, were not normally prescribed by law, and were
customar y only, and that we must not tr y to conclude too much from the two known
instances where civic regulation has been specifically attested (the one other case, a
late-four th-centur y sacred law from Cyrene, concerned with purification, contains
prescriptions for brides to sacrifice to Ar temis or risk pollution, exclusion and a fine:
Parker 1983: 345; Dillon 1999: 67).
But if Aphrodite, like Ar temis and Hera, to name but the most obvious female
deities, was customarily associated with marriage in her own right, then why in this
case Pandamos, `of the entire people'? This was not Aphrodite in a guise suited to an
essentially private even if socially expected act. This Aphrodite's primar y role was not,
as one might at first think, that of patron of love, and therefore of marriage. As
Pandamos her role was primarily linked with the collective well-being of the civic
community. Aphrodite's role as protectress of mutual af fection and harmony within
marriage, of good relations between husbands and wives, cer tainly explains, associa
tively, her more general role as protectress of harmony and understanding within
collectives of people, hence her epithet Pandamos: `of the entire people' (at Athens,
with the same epithet, she was associated with the synoikismos of the people of Attika
into one polis). It also explains why, more par ticularly, all over the Greek world, she
was the goddess who guarded good relations within bodies of magistrates. In many
cities, magistrates made dedications to Aphrodite at the end of their term of of fice
and in these cases she frequently took her epithet from the specific body she pro
tected: thus we find Aphrodite Strategis (`of the strategoi' ± not, in this period a
militar y function), Nomophylakis, Timouchos (`of the timouchoi'), or even Synarchis
(`of joint of fice-holding'). Peitho Ã (Persuasion), Homonoia (Concord) and the Char
ites (Graces) all feature in similar contexts and were often associated with Aphrodite in
magistrates' dedications, just as they were associated also, on a private level, with
marriage and concord between spouses (L. Rober t, BE 1959, no 325 and 1961, no
487; Sokolowski 1964; Croissant and Salviat 1966; Dillon 1999).
The underlying connection in the case of Kos, as in many other places (for we
should not unduly emphasize the dif ference between custom and regulation) was,
however, not simply one of associating good relations within marriage with good
relations within the citizen body. It has recently been written that `the Greeks liked to
think associatively about familial concord and civic concord, comparing living en
famille to living as a citizen body, or comparing a good statesman to a good father'
(Th Â eriault 1996: chapter 4). But explaining this kind of thinking in terms of associ
ation only is to see as two-dimensional something that was multi-faceted, and as
detached something that was intricately entangled. The collective mentality and
identity of the citizens of Kos, or any other ancient citizen body, were characterized
not just by associative thinking (which might, anyway, be better described as con
nective thinking with a strong historical dimension) but also, and especially, by
Family Structures 325



connective acting, both collectively and individually. On Kos, as elsewhere, whether
by obligation or `only' by custom, the private ser ved to reinforce the public and the
complex of associations evoked by `Aphrodite' was reflected in a tangle of civic acting,
both public and private. Women who had recently married had to sacrifice to
Aphrodite Pandamos so that, through guaranteeing the well-being of their marriage
they guaranteed the well-being of the city; domestic concord was intrinsically con
nected to public concord in the same way as concord within bodies of magistrates
was. It was thus that they actively `increased the honours' of the goddess, and we
should read it as meaning that Aphrodite Pandamos and ever ything she stood for
needed to be properly anchored in all areas of civic life. Through repeated sacrificing
the community's order and harmony were guaranteed. The continuum between
idion and koinon underlies the rituals and gives them meaning, and it is in no way
unusual that nothai and female paroikoi also had to share in the sacrificing: the
harmony of their marriages was as essential to the entire city's well-being as was
that of the inner circle of politides.
5 Civic and Royal Families
Something similar to the Koan prescriptions is being aimed at in the following set of
regulations recorded in a decree of the city of Iasos (and can we really tell whether the
`older' rituals onto which the new are being grafted, had been `customar y' rather
than prescribed by law?):
Let [the people] elect [each year] a maiden (parthenos) [as priestess] of queen Aphro[dite
La]odike; in the formal processions let her wear a headband of mingled white; let it not
be possible for the same to be priestess twice . . . this honour on the [. . . day of ] Aphrodi
sion, on which day queen Laodike was born, and let all the. . . be present and let the men
who are about to wed and the women who are about to wed [after the completion of
their wedding] sacrifice to Queen [Laodike . . . according to] their means, each one . . . of
the queen; let . . . all the priestesses and the [maidens about to wed] all take part in the
procession . . . first fruit of fering. (Decree of Iasos for queen Laodike, wife of Antiochos
III, c. 196 B C . I.Iasos 4, B 14±28; trans. as Ma 1999: no. 26)
The major innovation, here, of course, is the accommodation of an aspect of the new
reality of monarchic power into the ritual complex of a city. By remodelling existing
ritual practices new meaning was added without losing the meaning of the old. In
Iasos an existing ritual connected with marriage was turned into a joint celebration of
royal power and the power of Aphrodite, and the symbolic impor tance of Laodike's
role as royal wife was expanded into that of protectress of marriage through her
association with Aphrodite. Elsewhere, in Teos, a fountain in theagora was dedicated
to Laodike from which water for the ritual baths of brides was to be drawn. In both
cities, rituals focused on the person of the queen complemented others which
elevated and incorporated Antiochos' power (Ma 1999: chapter 4; Savalli-Lestrade
1994).
Despite the evident ability of civic ritual systems to incorporate new political
realities, the interaction of royal and civic ideology created areas of tension in
Hellenistic cities and in some ways profoundly altered civic structures. In a recent
book John Ma (1999) has shown the fundamental disjunctions that existed between
326 Riet van Bremen



the language and ideology of Hellenistic kingship and that of the civic community. In
their negotiations both kings and cities had to find a common language of represent
ing what was fundamentally unequal interaction, and express, in terms of reciprocity
and dialogue, a relationship which was in real terms one of ruler and subject. This
disjunction of the royal and the civic was felt also on the level of family thinking.
The overlap between the public/political and the private within a monarchy is, of
course, total. Power and authority are vested in the person of the king, indirectly in
his wife and children. Monarchical succession is based on the successful producing of
of fspring, and alliances are forged and reforged through marriages. The Hellenistic
cour t was a community of intimi, around whom circles of philoi, friends (who were at
the same time of ficials) replicated and reinforced royal behaviour and ideology (the
`cour t' of the Ptolemaic strategos on Cyprus is an interesting case in point). And just
as the private thoughts of the king became public ± and became command ± through
the device of the royal letter, so, through the same medium of communication, did
the intimate language of the cour t find its way into the public sphere. Queen Laodike,
in a letter thanking the citizens of Sardis for instituting a cult and festival, refers to her
`brother and husband', the king, and her paidia, her `little ones', using a term of
endearment belonging to the intimacy of a household (Gauthier 1989: chapter 2; Ma
1999: no. 2). A letter of Antiochos III giving instructions to set up a cult for queen
Laodike his `sister and wife' refers to her philostorgia towards himself and mentions
his own philostorgia for her as a motivation. (RC 36±7; Ma 1999: no. 37). Philo
storgia is the word for familial af fection: like paidia, it is used in private between
parents and children, or spouses. With precisely those private connotations it occurs
on hundreds of tombstones; but although it was par t of a common Greek language, it
was not par t of the public and political discourse of Greek cities.
Cities needed to respond to this emphasis on the dynastic, the familial and the
private, and incorporate it into their own ver y dif ferent language of equality and civic
solidarity. In doing so, they could not help giving at least some of it a civic twist.
When, for instance, the royal Seleukid couple Antiochos III and Laodike were
incorporated into the ritual and representational world of Teos, they were separated,
just as the Halikarnassian pr ytaneis and their wives had been, into a male and a female
half, each with its own domain. At Teos the focus of Antiochos' ritual and cultic
presence in the city was in the bouleuterion, while Laodike's fountain in the market
place was at the centre of entirely separate rituals (though cult images of both as
common saviours were also erected in the temple of Dionysos alongside that of the
god). And when, at Iasos, Laodike complemented her husband's benefactions to the
city by promising an annual gift of wheat from the sale of which dowries were to be
funded for poor citizen girls, the Iasians instituted, in return, a priestess for her from
among the city's girls. Ever ywhere, queens were ser ved by their own priestesses, often
by unmarried girls. Hellenistic royal couples were not, at any time, ser ved by couples
of priests. The contrast with the provincial and civic Roman imperial cult is striking:
imperial priests were husband and wife teams, and even if the priestess was separately
responsible for the female members of the imperial household the joint `front'
presented was that of a married couple (van Bremen 1996: 12±13).
Some of the aspects that characterized the public personae of queens were remark
ably absent from the way citizen women acted and were represented in public. Their
capacity to intercede with their royal husbands was frequently appealed to and is well
Family Structures 327



documented (see below for an example). Characteristically, queens would supplement
the benefactions of their husbands, often specializing in more humanistic or philan
thropic gifts (Laodike's concer n with poor girls' dowries has a precedent in that of
Phila, daughter of Antipater and wife of Demetrios Poliorketes, who married of f, at
her own expense, daughters and sisters of poor soldiers; Diod. 19.59.4). The lan
guage in which their own benefactions were phrased never failed to refer explicitly to
those of their royal husbands, as in Laodike's letter to the Iasians quoted below. It is
interesting to note, incidentally, that Laodike's gift was specifically aimed at assisting
Antiochos' ef for t to `increase the citizen body', underlining the advantage to the
entire people of poor citizen girls being able to marr y so that the citizen body might
replenish itself `from within':
He gave back to you your liber ty and your laws, and in other matters he strives to
increase the citizen body (politeuma) and to bring it in a better condition, and making it
my own intention to act in accordance with his zeal and eagerness, and, because of this,
to confer some benefaction on the poor among the citizens, and a general advantage
among the whole people . . . . If you remain as is right in your behaviour towards my
brother and generally towards our house, and if you gratefully remember the benefac
tions which you have met with, I shall tr y to procure for you other favours that I can
think up, since I make it my intention in all matters to concur with the will of my
brother . . . (Letter of Laodike to the Iasians ll. 8±14; 25±30; trans. as Ma 1999: no. 26)
Royal couples presented themselves consistently as a couple or en famille and civic
well-wishing formulas therefore often included wives and children. Even those who
were royal only by association, or had dynastic pretensions, like Olympichos, Seleukos
II's strategos in Karia, received this treatment: in a letter to the citizens of Mylasa,
Olympichos refers to the city's envoys who had promised `to honour me, my wife
Nikaia, and my children with due honours' (Crampa 1969: no. 6). In nearby Pana
mara, the local koinon honoured the Macedonian king Philip V, decreeing that the
priest of Panamaran Zeus was to `pray on behalf of the safety of the king and the
queen and their children' (I.Stratonikeia 3).
On the civic level, the inclusion of a man's wife and children in any honours or
public commemoration was unheard of. The ideology of civic politics was determined
by notions of `good citizenship'. In both its male and female versions the `ideal'
citizen was, as M. WÈ orrle has memorably described him, a `Polisfanatiker' whose
ever y ef for t, including his wealth, was at the ser vice of his fellow citizens (W È o rrle
1995; cf. van Bremen 1996: chapter 6). Even though this period sees the emergence
of the civic benefactor, or euergetes, within civic politics, and the concomitant emer
gence of female euergetism, the wives of major Hellenistic euergetai were never
associated with their husbands in public nor were they even referred to by name,
and vice versa. Since women, in their own name, and as members of the body of
politides, regularly took on priesthoods or ± religious ± liturgies in a female pendant to
the male system of civic duties, it was predominantly in this context that female
euergetism developed. It is therefore too simplistic (and actually wrong) to say that
it was royal example (i.e. the inclusion of royal wives and the emphasis on a dif ferent
familial model in which there was a place for women) that was responsible for the
emergence of women as civic benefactresses in their own right. The reality was
dif ferent and a great deal more complex.
328 Riet van Bremen



The increasing visibility of women in the public sphere (more visible also to us, in
honorific or in dedicator y inscriptions) and the evident wealth some women were able
to employ for the good of their fellow citizens, should be understood as an intrinsic
par t of the more general development of euergetism as a political factor within
Hellenistic cities and the gradual oligarchization of civic politics. The roots and causes
of this development are themselves complicated and cannot be discussed in detail
here, but are well analysed in Veyne 1976 and Gauthier 1985. Too often this feature
of Hellenistic civic life is explained as a direct result of the loosening of family
restrictions on women and their consequent ability to control their `own' wealth. It
is placed within an evolutionar y scheme and held up as a sign of women's advance
ment relative to `their' position in the Classical period. The explanator y value of such
schemes in a more general sense is doubtful (on this see now C. Patterson 1998:
chapter 1) and more often than not, they distort and misunderstand actual historical
contexts.
In a seminal discussion of the development of euergetism as a political factor in the
Hellenistic period, Ph. Gauthier rightly argued that the ± inevitable ± disjunction
between institutional developments and conventional period boundaries meant
that in terms of developments within Greek civic institutions, a meaningful `break'
occurred (or becomes visible) only in the course of the second centur yB C , not at the
beginning of the Hellenistic period. The four th, third and early second centuriesB C
were ver y much par t of a continuum (Gauthier 1985: introduction). This obser vation
is equally valid for the aspects of civic, and private, life that this chapter has been
concerned with. The centuries after Alexander constitute the period during which
civic `family thinking' reached its culmination, as did the par ticular civic model whose
features were already in place in the four th centur y (and even before, in the fifth). In
the course of the second centur y B C changes began to appear which, though not
entirely undermining the model, never theless shifted its internal emphasis away from
the egalitarian `family of citizens' towards an ideology that placed the families of those
who governed at the centre of civic ideology, language and imager y. For a consider
able time, the gradual ver ticalization of the relationship between the wealthy and
politically active `few' and their less active (or less wealthy) fellow citizens was
contained by the traditions and assumptions of the Classical Greek city; by notions
of equality and solidarity and the political±communal aspects of civic life. The royal
family model took some time to filter down to the level of civic politics but it is easy to
see how its language and ideology fitted that of an emerging civic elite. It is here, in
the abandoning of the `old' continuum between the private and the public and the
`old' solidarity between those that made up the collective family of citizens, that the
greatest shifts in terms of family dynamics took place.
But whether it was this, rather than the increased mobility of individuals and the
new patterns of settlement that emerged, which affected the fundamental principles
that shaped Greek collective existence, is not easy to say, nor is it possible to gauge the
precise extent of the changes. To look for linear patterns of cause and ef fect in a world
as complex as the Hellenistic is simplistic and, ultimately, unsatisfactor y. The two
broad aspects of the relationship between political community and private family
group that I have discussed in this chapter never moved at the same pace and it is
not easy to show that, or how, changes in one generated changes in the other, or vice
versa. The functional connection between the private and the public (civic endogamy
Family Structures 329



and ever ything that follows from it) and the transcendent, representational connec
tion which af fected mentality, behaviour, language and individual psychologies, stood
in a complex relationship to one another, never exactly expressing the same reality.
Collective memories and mentalities feed on a multitude of realities past and present,
internal and external, and are capable, in their turn, of shaping reality. For the
historian it is the ever-shifting disjunction between these two areas of ancient life
which it is as challenging to tr y to understand as that between the rapid movements of
high politics and the slower pace of institutional changes.

Some of the best books and ar ticles on this subject are written in languages other than
English. By far the best recent discussion of Greek mar riage practice in the widest
sense of the word is VÂ erilhac and Vial 1998. Vatin 1970 is ambitious in scope and
stimulating, but should be read with the review of Gauthier 1972b. Davies 1977±78,
though discussing Classical Athens, is excellent for underlying concepts and therefore
relevant for our period; Ogden 1996 discussed bastardy in the Classical and Hellen
istic periods. On civic organization see N. Jones 1987; on

Br ul Â e 1990 and Pomeroy 1997(a and b) both tr y to draw wide-ranging demo

documenting naturalization of a large group of individuals, but their conclusions are
unreliable. Pomeroy's interpretation of the Ilion document is shown to be unsound
in L.-M. Gu È nther 1992.

CHAPTER TWENTY
The Economy
Gary Reger
1 Introduction
A long inscription from Kos lays obligations on sailors: `When they shall complete
their journey by sea let those who ser ve in the big ships sacrifice to Aphrodite Pontia
on her aforementioned altar an adult victim wor th 30 drachmas for each tent, or let
them pay the priestess instead of her traditional gifts 10 drachmas for each tent and
one drachma in the of fering-box' (Parker and Obbink 2000: 416±17, lines 5±9). The
fundamental purpose here is religious ± to give thanksgiving for coming back safely
from the sea. But the obligations drew the sailors into the local economy: someone
raised the sheep to be sacrificed; someone brought that sheep to market (the
agora
),
where he haggled with the sailors' representatives over the price; the priestess received
either par t of the animal (which she could sell or keep) or cash. And the sailors had to
have 30 or more drachmas in cash to pay for their purchase ± money obtained as pay
from the state or from their own resources. Economic transactions saturated the act
of piety, and so it was in vir tually ever y aspect of Hellenistic life. The economy was
ever ywhere.
Analysis over the last centur y of the Hellenistic economy has operated along two
main dimensions. One is the `primitivist±modernist' dichotomy. The `modernizing'
view (associated, not always fairly, with Michael Rostovtzef f, but going back to
Eduard Meyer) saw the Hellenistic economy as dominated by price-setting markets
that embraced the whole Hellenistic world. `Capitalist' enterprises, operating on a
considerable scale, produced, transpor ted and sold goods over long distances in
completely monetarized markets. The competing `primitivist' view (associated with
M. I. Finley, but going back to Karl Bu È cher) argued instead for an ancient economy
composed of an enormous number of tiny, `autarchic' (self-suf ficient) units ± some
times, but not always, equivalent to a
polis
± that operated almost without interaction.
The other dimension was the `formalist±substantivist'. Formalists saw the economy as
a separate sphere, like the economy today, if less sophisticated. Substantivists (Finley
again, following especially Karl Polanyi) saw the economy instead as `socially embed
ded and politically overdetermined and so . . . conspicuously conventional, irrational,



and stat us-ridden ' (Car tledge 2002: 15; cf. Loom is 1998: 251± 4; Mor ris in Finl ey
1999: ix±xxxv i).
More recen t work has te nded to reject such stark dichoto mies. It is becom ing
clearer that the Hell enistic econo my was not a mon olith that can b e describe d within
a single, compl ete analytic al framework . On the one hand, the majority of people
living in the three centurie s of the Helleni stic pe riod we re cer tainly small-scale , larg ely
subsisten ce far mers who nev er trav elled much beyond where the y were bo r n. At the
same time , these peop le we re conne cted to a wider world through their local polity
and through the marke ts which they patronize d, wheth er to buy goods they could
not produce on the ir own (potter y , worke d metal goods) or to sell their own
surplus es to get cash. C ash for med par t of their reser ve agains t bad time s, whi ch
they might use to buy impor ted staples like grai n, olive oil, or whe at whe n their own
crops failed; or to buy up neighbo ur's land (as Hesio d advised many years befor e); or
to pay the taxes imposed by the polis or the sovereign. At a wider level, there were
regional unit s of ex change (Hor den and Purcell 2000) within which goods and
people flowed, some times centred aroun d a famou s sa nctuar y like Del phi or Delos,
someti mes created by the realitie s of geograp hy , so metimes the result of exercise of
political and militar y powe r, wheth er pre sent or a res idue of the past. Final ly , the new
big kingdom s ± the Antigon ids in Macedon and Gre ece, the Ptole mies in Egypt, and
the Seleukids almost ever ywhere else ± created loci of economic activity , of produc
tion, exchang e and co nsumption. In the cont ext of the se more compl ex lev els there
were peop le and goods that travell ed far a nd wide; these are of ten the most visib le to
us. T here we re also extrao rd inar y dif ferenc es in wealth ± noth ing as ex treme perhap s
as came later with the Romans, but still the distance was extraord inar y between
Dioge nes, who only wanted Alexande r the Great to stop blocki ng the sun and
recommended begging for one's meals at temples (D.L. 6. 38; Plut. Alex. 14), and
the owner of the `Maison d es comediens ', on e of the most magni ficent houses on
Delos ± to say nothing of the resource s command ed by a Ptolemy II Philade lphos or a
Seleuko s Nikat or. T he scene is then one of enor mou s c omplexit y and diver sity ,
operat ing on many dif fer ent lev els and many dif ferent scales at the sa me time , in
changing relations to each othe r a cross time and space. Some work has now begun to
appear attemp ting to model su ch econo mic inter relationshi ps. As these mod els are
ar ticu lated, criti qued and revised, new ways of lookin g at the Helleni stic econo my
and new questions to ask about it wil l undoubt edly emerg e (see especially Davies
1998).
The fundam ental feat ure of the econo my ± as in all pre-mo der n econo mies ± was
the prod uction of food (Isager and Skyds gaard 1992 ). Such prod uction took place
largely in the countr yside (though many poleis had considerable empty space within
the town that might be tur ned ove r to gard ens or even larger agricu ltural prod uc
tion). In Greece and much of wester n Asia Minor the countr yside was subject to poleis
and the owners o f the land were citizens. The agri cultur al comm odities produced on
this land ± grain, oliv es and the ir o il, wine, vegetab les and fr uits like figs, chees e from
sheep and goats, me at ± we re consum ed larg ely b y the producers themse lves or were
sold in the local market, the agora, to fellow -citizens. This economic activity remains
largely invi sible to us, though its charac ter and in some cases so mething of its quant ity
occasiona lly peeps through the veil. Th e operat ion of this agricult ural ent erprise
332 Gary Reger



depended fundamentally on the conditions of production that prevailed in the
ancient eastern Mediterranean.
2 Physical Preconditions
Greece and the eastern Aegean basin lie within a Mediterranean climate zone. The
region experiences basically two seasons, summer and winter. Summers typically are
hot and dr y, winters cool to cold and rainy. Most of the rain that falls comes between
October or November and April or May. This general climatic regime imposes a
par ticular approach to the growing of food. Generally speaking, farmers planted (and
still plant) cereal crops (largely wheat and barley) in the fall with the onset of the rains.
Har vest came in spring or early summer, after the rains ended. The amount of rainfall
can var y drastically from year to year (`high interannual variability'). In a dr y farming
regime ± that is, with reliance on rainfall alone and no or little irrigation ± wheat
demands at least 300 mm of precipitation during the growing season, barley rather
less (200±250 mm). Generally speaking, Greece and the Aegean basin generally get
fewer than 300 mm ever y other year, fewer than 200 mm ever y four th or fifth year.
Crop failures were therefore a built-in element of the agricultural regime of the
Hellenistic world. Fur ther, highly variable transient local conditions could make life
miserable for a farmer while sparing a neighbour (some examples in Reger 1994b:
102±4). Alkiphron, an ar tful writer of the second centur y A D , has left us a collection
of fictional letters by ordinar y people. In one a farmer writes to his neighbour:
A severe hailstorm has cut down our crops, and there's no remedy for hunger. We can't
buy impor ted wheat because we have no money. I hear you still have stores left from last
year's good yield. Lend me twenty medimnoi, so I can sur vive, me and my wife and kids.
When har vest comes, we'll pay you back `measure for measure, and better', if there's any
abundance. Don't ignore good neighbours being destroyed in a tight season. (2.3)
At typical levels of consumption, twenty medimnoi would keep a family of four for
about a year (Reger 1994b: 86±9). It was in par t to temper the ef fects of such variations
that Greek farmers typically practised highly scattered farming, with small plots in
dif ferent micro-environments (Halstead and Jones 1989; Gallant 1991: 41±5).
But the Hellenistic world embraced much more than the old Aegean basin, and
conditions in the new kingdoms of Egypt and Asia could be ver y dif ferent. The high
Anatolian plateau, for example, presents in par ts deser t-like conditions; summers are
fiercely hot and winters bitterly cold, with snow; the agricultural regime there
demands cereal cultivation in the summer. Mesopotamia, a hear tland of the Seleukid
empire, was home to one of the world's oldest irrigation regimes. Because the bed of
the Euphrates lies higher than the Tigris `many canals have been cut from it, some of
which are always running and supply water to the inhabitants on either bank, while
others are constructed as occasion requires, whenever they are shor t of water to
irrigate the land; for in general this countr y gets no rain'. Alexander the Great found
the weirs built on the Tigris an obstruction to navigation and removed them; but
rather than intended, as Arrian has him say, to foil attack by naval forces, they were
likely par t of the irrigation system (Arr. Anab. 7.7.3±7, trans. Brunt).
The Economy 333



3 Human Resources
Two basic questions are the total size and the distribution of the population of the
Hellenistic world. A recent rough estimate puts the population of Alexander's empire
± thus essentially the whole Hellenistic world ± at 30±35 million (Aperghis 2001: 72±
7, but the matter requires thorough re-examination; for a penetrating analysis of
Roman Egypt, Scheidel 2001; brief general over view in Cor visier and Suder 2000:
44±9). This figure can be used to estimate total taxation, demand for food and other
economic variables en gros. The total resources available to the Seleukid kings, for
instance, have been estimated at about one talent per thousand population per year
(based largely on data from Mesopotamia; Aperghis 2001). Such a population would
demand roughly 120±175 million medimnoi of grain per year (one medimnos Attic
held roughly 52 kg). Such estimates help us grasp the total size of economic activity in
the Hellenistic world, but elide impor tant details. Distribution of the population is an
equally impor tant variable. The majority of the population cer tainly lived on the land
± whether in nucleated villages or isolated farmsteads, for both patterns can be found
(Sapr ykin 1994; 1997: 179±208; Spencer 1995; Kolesnikov and Jacenko 1999).
These people farmed for a living and supplied most of their own needs for food. In
some cases people preferred to live aggregated in a single settlement within the
territor y of a polity, but as long as the territor y was small, like the island of Melos,
people could still commute to their farms and live of f the production (Renfrew and
Wagstaf f 1982: 251±6). It was in bigger places like Attica where a considerable
por tion of the population did not farm that questions of food supply became a matter
of continual concern (Garnsey 1988).
But the Hellenistic world saw the creation of truly large cities, such as Alexandria in
Egypt, Seleukeia on the Tigris, Antiocheia on the Orontes and many others of lesser
size (Billows, this volume). Such foundations in the newly conquered territories had
the ef fect of creating new centres of high urban density and of drawing at least their
ruling and militar y elite from the population of Greece. That is to say, there was
undoubtedly also a marked transfer of population eastward and southward (to
Egypt). Whether the population as a whole grew, declined, or remained stable over
time is dif ficult to say. Recent archaeological research (sur veys) has suggested that, in
some par ts at least of old Greece, the number of rural habitations declined over the
Hellenistic period (Alcock 1993: 33±92, but see Cor visier and Suder 2000: 112±17
for a dif ferent view and see the impor tant critique of conclusions about rural habita
tion for the Athenian deme of Atene based on sur vey work: Osborne 1996: 55±6).
This discover y can be conjoined with a famous complaint of Polybios: `In our time
the whole of Greece has been subject to a low bir th rate and a general decrease of the
population, owing to which cities have become deser ted and the land has ceased to
yield fruit, although there have neither been continuous wars or epidemics.' Polybios
attributes this decline to greed: people refused to marr y, or refused to have children,
or were unwilling to raise more than one or two children, so as to leave them the
whole of their patrimony; when one or more died prematurely, `houses must have
been left unoccupied, and as in the case of swarms of bees, so by small degrees cities
became resourceless and feeble' (Polyb. 36.17.5±6, trans. Paton). Two letters of
Philip V of Macedon to the city of Larisa in Thessaly show his concern to repopulate
the city and restore its agricultural base. Larisan ambassadors came to him and
334 Gary Reger



`revealed to me that your city needs more inhabitants on account of the wars'; he
instructed Larisa to enrol resident Greeks as citizens. These actions were intended to
ensure that `the land will be cultivated to a greater extent' (SIG
3 543; Austin 60;
Dench, this volume, section 1). But the issue here, as in Spar ta too (E. David 1981:
142±70), was not depopulation in general, but a decline in the number of citizens.
Philip was quite confident that enough people lived at Larisa to keep the land farmed;
the problem was their exclusion from the land because they lacked citizen rights. And
Polybios' complaint is framed in moral, not economic, terms.
What all this suggests is that patterns of settlement changed in the Hellenistic
period. In the shor t term cities might by devastated by war or other disasters (like the
famous Rhodian ear thquake); in these cases inter vention by higher authorities might
ameliorate or even solve the problem. In other cases the actions of kings themselves
rearranged settlement patterns, as when they moved populations to form new cities
(G. Cohen 1995; Reger 2004). But there were longer-term and larger-scale trans
formations as well, like the transfer of population to Egypt and the Middle East, that
followed from structural changes in the Hellenistic world. These changes could not
help but reorganize aspects of the economy, though we must be cautious in suppos
ing that such changes were always fundamental and complete. For example, despite
the planting of many new Greek cities in the Middle East, the basic structure of
economic life there seems to have been relatively little af fected. These changes ± if
changes they were ± were neither exclusively Hellenistic phenomena nor uniformly
distributed over the Hellenistic world. Even if the regions of Asia and Africa that
came under the suzerainty of Hellenistic kings saw a net impor t of people (Davies
1984: 266±7), people moved in the reverse direction as well. A garrison of at least
120 men established by the Ptolemies on the Aegean island of Thera consisted largely
of soldiers from Pisidia and Pamphylia in Asia Minor, under the command of an
Aspendian (IG 12.3.325 with p. 230 and 3 Suppl. p. 283; L. Rober t 1963: 388, 411±
18); 39 of 42 soldiers stationed at Delphi by King Attalos in 208 hailed from
Pergamon (ISE 2.81). Traders from the Levant settled on Delos, like a family from
Tyre (Le Dinahet-Couilloud 1997). And some par ts of the old Greek world must
have continued to be able to expor t population, at least for par t of the Hellenistic
period. Macedon, for one, continued to supply soldiers and settlers in the third
centur y, and Crete remained a ver y fer tile source for mercenaries throughout the
Hellenistic centuries (Cor visier and Suder 2000: 44±8).
For the most par t, productive labour was exercised by individuals and their families
on their own farms, as the Grouch in Menander's play, who eschewed even the help of
his neighbours (lines 328±31). But even in the sphere of self-suf ficient agriculture,
the rhythms of labour demand were such that farmers must have depended at har vest
time on the assistance of others, whether mutual help of neighbours or the ser vices of
paid seasonal labourers (Gallant 1991: 60±112, 143±69). These forms of labour
exchange have left almost no traces in our sources. For wealthier farmers ± whether
owner-operators or absentee landlords ± another labour option existed: slaver y
(Gabrielsen, this volume). Typically our sources for agricultural slaver y (as opposed
to other forms) are poor, but they suffice, especially given how scattered and
casual they are, to guarantee that slave labour was a standard feature of the rural
landscape. For example, in the early second centur y a citizen of Mylasa in Karia `came
to the boule and the assembly and declared that a slave (soma) of his had run away and
The Economy 335



come to Myndos'; the Mylaseans appointed an ambassador to go to Myndos and seek
relief (I.Mylasa 102.23±6; see generally Burford 1993: 208±22).
Manumission, the freeing of slaves, was a relatively common feature of Hellenistic
slaver y, but manumission was often tempered by conditions that secured continued
use of par t of the slaves' economic value for the former owner. When sometime in the
third centur y one female slave and three males bought their freedom and that of their
wives and children from their owner Attinas (for a total of 325 gold staters), they were
obligated to `remain with Attinas while Attinas lives and do whatever Attinas orders'
(ISE 109; trans. Burstein 54) ± a highly conditional freedom indeed. A great many
such conditional manumissions are known from Macedon, Thessaly, Delphi, Kalymna
and other places, suf ficient to prove that the practice was widespread and typical.
Many poleis could avail themselves of another type of labour, provided by the
ser vices of subordinated populations. The helots of Spar ta are the most famous
example (Alcock 2001; Ducat 2002), but there are plenty of other examples from
the Hellenistic world. At Priene in Asia Minor a subordinated group called the Pedieis
(`plain-dwellers') rebelled against their Greek masters in the 280s with the help of a
neighbouring polis. The terror the insurrection provoked and the heavy punishments
meted out to the rebels appear in inscriptions that refer to the events (I.Priene 14.5±
7, 14, 3.14±15; Bur ford 1993: 206±7).
4 Forms of Movement
Sokrates famously remarked that the sights outside Athens had no attraction for him,
and although he was perhaps extreme in his love of the town, cer tainly most people in
the Hellenistic world never travelled far from where they were born. Shor t-distance
movement, of course, was never theless a mainstay of the ver y local economy. Agri
cultural commodities and rural products ± grain, olive oil, wines, vegetables, meat,
wood for fire and construction, stone ± all had to be transpor ted from their points of
origin to points of sale and consumption. Mules loaded with faggots of wood or sacks
of grain, like those evoked in a four th-centur y speech of Demosthenes (42.5±7),
must have been common sights. A landowner of Mylasa in Karia had to move the
grapes grown on his estates to the press in his house in town (en tei polei; I.Mylasa
205±6 and unpublished material). Heavier commodities, like building stone, were
moved in wagons pulled by yokes of oxen. An inscription from Athens dated to 330/
29 honours Eudemos of Plataia, who `has now given 1000 pairs of oxen for the
making of the Panathenaic stadium and theatre' (IG22 351.15±18; cf. Loomis 1998:
110±11), no doubt for the transpor t of building stone (though whether over longer
distance, say from the quarries, or on-site, is unclear).
For long distances, recent work in Roman Italy has suggested that the network of
roads built there had a trade component, or at least ser ved incidentally to enhance
trade. Handbooks like Cato the Elder's De agricultura seem to presuppose the
existence of a land transpor tation network and its usability for transpor t of farm
products (Laurence 1998b). For western Asia Minor Strabo describes a Common
Road running from Ephesos to Magnesia on the Maeander and then along the river
into Phr ygia (14.2.29). This road may have existed already in the Achaimenid period
(French 1998). As a conduit for militar y and civilian traf fic, it helped to assure the
prosperity of a brace of small communities strung out along it (Marchese 1986: 139±
336 Gary Reger



41). Strabo describes Karoura, a town along the road, as `a village having inns
(pandocheia) and springs of hot water' (Strabo 12.8.17, trans. French 1998: 32).
The economics of land transpor t will have varied from place to place and time to time.
Clearly, the emergence in Italy of Rome in the third and second centuries as a massive
urban conglomeration, heavy with demand for food and the ability to pay for it, will
have seeded the development of a regional, or supra-regional, network of trade to
satisfy those demands. The role of roads like that between Athens and Thebes, of
which a picturesque description sur vives (Austin 83), will have been more modest.
But in any case, we can be confident that land transpor t played an impor tant role in
the movement of goods and people; the quandar y remains, as so often, our inability
to quantify (see still Bur ford 1960).
Transportation by sea was always more impor tant because of the vastly reduced
expense, especially for the movement of bulk goods. The bustling intersection
between sea and land is evoked nicely in a stor y from a fourth-centur y handbook
on sur viving sieges. The agora of the besieged town was filled with boxes packed with
clothes or other goods, crates, mats, par tially woven sails, jars of chaff and wool,
baskets of raisins and figs, amphorae full of wheat and dried figs, gourds and a load of
firewood (Aen. Tact. 29.1±10). Some of these items may have come from close by
and others brought in from long distances ± it is impossible to be sure, though one
may guess (see Reger 2003). Even if har vested locally, as is not unlikely, firewood was
probably transported (like other bulky goods) by water if possible; this situation is
reflected both in the Delian regulations on the sale of wood and wood products (ID
504; Descat 2001) and a four th-centur y inscription from Torone, in which a mer
chant begs a colleague to `send to me straight away if you have a ship, buying seven
talents (of wood) if it is possible' (Henr y 1991; cf. Davies 2001).
Our knowledge of the typical size and fittings of Hellenistic ships derives mostly
from wrecks. Literar y accounts like Moschion's of a great ship built by Hieron of
Syracuse (301±215) tend to focus on the exceptional (Athen. 5.206d±9b with Casson
1986: 191±9). Ships mentioned in documents seem to have ranged typically from 95
to 165 tons. These figures may not represent the full capacity since they come from
repor ts of cargoes, usually grain; the ships may have carried other goods as well, as
both Moschion's repor t and wrecks suggest. According to a recent comprehensive
study, many Hellenistic wrecks were small ships, of 50 tons burden or less, with mixed
cargoes suggesting that `[t]he predominant activity represented by these wrecks may
have been tramping ± the speculative and small-scale contractual transport of goods
along coastal routes, often within an established economic region' (Gibbins 2001:
294). This picture however does not preclude some highly-organized, `destination
conscious' shipping, par ticularly of either luxur y goods or staples like grain intended
for large and predictable markets like Athens. But shipwrecks, horrible as they no
doubt were for those who experienced them, tell a good deal about the nature of
trade.
The trade about which we are best informed is that in staples like grains, wine and
olive oil. The reasons are simple, but make analysis dif ficult. Grain appears again and
again as a consequence of the ef for ts of poleis to secure satisfactor y supplies at
satisfactor y prices (Migeotte 1984; 1991; 1998). In many cases this means grain
grown locally, as for example in the Samian law regulating the sale of grain grown in
the Samian Peraia (IG 12.6.172; Bresson 2000: 253±7).
The Economy 337



In other cases, grain was impor ted from long distances. As in the Classical period
before, Athens remained the chief example of a city dependent on long-distance
imported grain. According to the Constitution of the Athenians attributed to Aristotle
and cer tainly composed in the 320s (48.4; Rhodes 1981), the Athenian assembly was
required to deliberate about the grain supply at its chief monthly meeting; in his
Rhetoric Aristotle himself recommends that the aspiring politician familiarize himself
with the supply of grain as one of five crucial areas of knowledge (1359b±60a). The
role of grain merchants becomes especially clear in times of stress.
Another body of evidence that contributes to our understanding of trade is
amphorae. Large potter y containers with tapered bottoms to make for easy packing
in ships, amphorae were produced in massive quantity in many par ts of the Hellenistic
world. They were used for the shipment of a wide variety of goods ± chiefly wine and
olive oil ± but in fact almost any commodity that could be put in a jar. Sometimes the
origin of amphorae can be determined from an analysis of the fabric of the pots
themselves (Whitbread 1995), but for many centres of production the preliminar y
work has only begun. In other cases the jars were marked with of ficial stamps,
typically on one or both of the handles, indicating the magistrate under whom the
jar was thrown and, sometimes, the origin. The stamps were probably used for local
fiscal purposes (and surely not as trade names, guarantors of quality, or for other
purposes aimed at end-consumers: see Garlan 1999: 75±83), though this has not
been absolutely established. At first blush a veritable quarr y of economic information,
these stamps are in fact devilishly dif ficult to analyse (Lawall 1998; Garlan 1999;
Finkielsztejn 2001b).
A good case study is four th-centur y Thasos. There is little doubt that the chief
product shipped in Thasian amphorae was wine. Thasian amphorae have been found
in greatest abundance in the Black Sea region, and there is evidence for return
shipment of goods from that region to Thasos, notably grain ([Dem.] 50.14±21;
for Black Sea products in the third centur y, Polyb. 4.38). The apogee of finds of
Thasian amphorae dates roughly to the 350s±340s, with a marked drop-of f there
after. But what this pattern means for the economy of Thasos or trade patterns is less
clear. A later four th-centur y Athenian speech ([Dem.] 35.35) reveals a cargo of wine
headed for the Black Sea composed of products from Attica, Peparethos, Kos,
Thasos, Mende and other cities ± here clearly the trade in Thasian wine was not in
Thasian hands, although there is also evidence for Thasian ships carr ying their own
product. Complicating our understanding of the structure of this trade is the rarity of
Thasian coins in the Black Sea (Garlan 1999: 83±92).
Finally, we may consider briefly the classic example, the amphorae of Rhodes. The
Rhodian material provides in many ways the greatest interpretative temptations, be
cause the Rhodians came to stamp their amphorae most consistently of all the Hellen
istic ateliers. But the practice entails problems. Because the Rhodians stamped both
handles of each amphora (albeit with dif ferent information), the numbers of stamped
Rhodian handles found at any site always over whelm those of other centres of produc
tion. Apparent Rhodian predominance must therefore always be tested (for an example
of the result of this exercise, Gibbins 2001: 290±3). Moreover, we cannot know with
cer tainty the numbers for other centres found at the same site, since many of competi
tors' amphorae may have remained unstamped (Lawall for thcoming). Finally, the
Rhodians' own practices were not consistent over time. They stamped relatively few
338 Gar y Reger



handles early in the Hellenistic period; by the later third and second centuries, in
contrast, the majority of amphorae produced were probably stamped (Finkielsztejn
2001a: 181±5). With these cautions in mind, we may note a trend. There is some
evidence to suggest that a predominance enjoyed by Rhodian amphorae in the third
and first half of the second centuries fell of f after 170 or so. Knidian amphorae seem to
replace Rhodian in the second half of the second centur y, although never achieving the
same level of predominance. This change has been attributed to a new preference for
Knidian wine especially among the Romans. Attractive as this explanation may seem at
first, it has holes; not least, that there is essentially no archaeological confirmation for
Knidian wine impor ts into Italy (Gibbins 2001: 291; generally now on the chronology
of Rhodian amphorae, Finkielsztejn 2001b).
5 Institutions of the Economy
The study of institutions is a fruitful way to think about economies which lack data to
permit more quantitative analysis (Nor th 1990). For the Hellenistic economy, it may
be useful to examine six out of many possibilities: mechanisms for setting prices;
banking, finance and credit; the
polis
; forms of inter-state economic co-operation; the
role of the Hellenistic kingdoms; and money.
Price setting
In the retail trade there can be little doubt that prices were typically set in the
agora
,
the market, as a result of face-to-face negotiations between sellers and buyers.
Anthropological studies of recent `bazaar economies' have emphasized the sophisti
cation of such interactions today (Geer tz et al. 1979: 123±313: a classic study). Much
depends on the information each side controls, the time of day, expectations ± or
guesses ± about the future. A series of barley prices from Delos shows intense
competition between sellers to supply the sanctuar y with feed for the sacred geese
under circumstances of apparently declining price (Reger 1994b: 10±11). A poet at
Iasos found himself abandoned when the bell pealed announcing the opening of the
fish market; in fish, freshness is all (Strabo 14.2.21). An inscription from Magnesia on
the Maeander gives a sense of the hustle and bustle of the agora, with people selling
linen, wool, dried fish, onions, and cheeses (
I.Magn
. 121); likewise an Athenian
inscription mentioning Persian dried fruit, nuts from Herakleia, pine-cones, chest
nuts, Egyptian beans, dates, dried fruits, lupines, olives, almonds and other goods
sold by weight (
IG
22 1013 with Meritt 1938: 127± 46, no. 27). But the state had
interests in overseeing prices. An inscription from Kyparissa in Messenia of the late
four th or early third centur y sets out regulations related to the collection of the
pentekoste
, the two per cent tax imposed by many
poleis
on impor ts and expor ts.
People who impor ted goods (
emporia
) into the
chora
of the
polis
had to register with
the
pentekostologoi
(the of ficials charged with collecting the tax) before they could
display or sell their goods. Expor ters were also required to pay the tax. And anyone
who underpriced his goods ± for the purpose, obviously, of evading par t of the tax ±
was to be compelled by the
pentekostologoi
to `do business according to the contract'
(
SIG
3 952; VÂ elissaropoulos 1980: 208±9). Market disequilibrium might also provoke
state inter vention. An
agoranomos
from Paros was honoured for tamping down bread
The Economy
339



prices and assuring availability (IG 12. 5.129). On a larger scale, the polis might seek
to soften grain prices by buying stocks for sale at a price below market, whether as a
one-time action or from a fund specifically created for these purposes (Migeotte
1991; 1998; Reger 1993). Festivals offered opportunities for profiteering, particu
larly when many strangers gathered together; states sought to regulate such affairs.
For example, for a festival at Andania in the Peloponnese the regulations for theagora
say:
Let the priests designate a place in which all items are to be sold. Let theagoranomos for
the city be in charge, so that the sellers sell genuine and ritually acceptable goods and use
the same weights and measures as the public ones, and let him not determine the price
for which something must be sold nor the time nor let him exact a fee from the sellers for
the place. As for those who do not sell as prescribed, let him whip the slaves but fine free
men twenty drachmae, and let the fine be sacred. (SIG 3 736)
Here the agoranomos is forbidden from fixing prices, but clearly he could have been
granted that authority (Bresson 2000: 173± 4). Fish were especially a subject of price
regulation, as a recently published Athenian inscription has re-emphasized (Bresson
2000: 151±82). The retail trade was carried out in part through shops; a Samian
regulation of 245/4 relating to four shops owned by Hera and rented out gives some
sense of the conditions of such arrangements (IG 12.6.169). Archaeological finds of
shops, or potential shops, include a considerable number of buildings off the agora in
Athens (Young 1951) and houses at Olynthos of late fourth century date that
included equipment for processing olives or grapes (Robinson and Graham 1938:
337± 43, and now Cahill 2002). On Delos another facility with presses, beds, storage
jars and other equipment associated with olive oil processing has been identified as a
perfumer y (Brun 1999). Evidence then for retail trade of various types and for local
manufacturing establishments is abundant.
It has recently been argued that Athenian officials in the fourth and third century
were able to set desirable (but not obligatory) wholesale prices for grain and to
encourage large-scale importers to abide by them through the award of public
honours (Bresson 2000: 183±210). Whether such price-setting was possible, or
attempted, for other goods (except fish and some meats) is unclear. Athens may in
any case have been exceptional because of the scale of its imports ± by the fourth
centur y, if not long before, the Athenians were certainly far from feeding themselves
from the harvest of their own territory ± and the regulations imposed to guarantee
imported grain. Smaller poleis may well have been more at the mercy of merchants and
highly variable supply and demand.
Finally, we may consider briefly whether there was a price-setting market that
embraced the whole, or much of, the Hellenistic world. This view was certainly
held by some earlier scholars, and has recently been revived in a modified form for
grain prices in the context of the Aegean (Bresson 2000: 263±307). It is however
certainly not the case that grain prices (those for which we are best informed) were
linked throughout the Hellenistic world, as a glance at prices from Babylon as
compared to Delos and Egypt will show (Drexhage 1991; Slotsky 1997; van der
Spek 2000; Aperghis 2001: 83±5). The degree to which prices may have moved in
tandem on a regional basis is less clear. Certainly, people in nearby cities may
340 Gary Reger



sometimes have enter tained similar notions about the appropriate level of price for
basic goods like grain, and may even, when their city had the economic might, striven
to obtain such prices from impor ters. It is also true that travelling merchants must
have had plenty of oppor tunity to compare prices in dif ferent towns on their routes.
But we are still ver y far from being able to say with assurance enough about the
structure of individual markets ± amount of local production, level of local demand
and so for th (with some, but still too few exceptions; see Reger 1994b) ± to mark
with any confidence the degree to which prices were linked at dif ferent times and
places. My own view is that such linkage, when it existed, was likely to be exceptional
and transient rather than permanent and structural.
Banks, financing, credit
Sources for credit and financing in the Hellenistic world included kings and their
cour tiers, whose wealth sometimes financed building projects or helped cities in
natural or man-made disasters; sanctuaries, which often controlled massive reser ves
of wealth built up over centuries; public banks run by the poleis; private banks; and
private groups and individuals who might lend money without interest. Interest
bearing loans were typically secured by `hypothecation' of real proper ty ± land,
buildings, ships and/or their cargo, slaves. Hypothecation dif fered from modern
mor tgages in that default led to the for feiture of the entire value of the hypothecated
good(s) to the creditor, even if their value exceeded the amount owed. But that did
not necessarily mean that proper ty-owners could not borrow repeatedly and simul
taneously on the security of a single piece of proper ty, as an Athenian inscription of
367/6 makes per fectly clear (Agora 19.P5.1±39).
Public banks appear in many documents. At Miletos, a gift of money by three
brothers in 206/5 was administered through a public bank to generate interest (Milet
I.3.145; SIG 3 577). When fifty years later King Eumenes II gave a large financial gift
to Miletos, this too was administered through the public bank, which made `com
mercial loans' (emporika daneia) with the capital (I.Didyma 488; Bogaert 1968:
259±61). A Rhodian public bank is also well attested (Gabrielsen 1997: 82). Another
source of capital was loans made by the state. Many poleis had funds from which
money was lent to private persons; the income from these loans might then be used to
finance a festival or dedications to the god(s). The stoa given to Miletos by Antiochos
falls into this categor y; so too, on a much smaller scale, do the loans on Delos which
financed the dedication of vases to Apollo (Reger 1992).
Private banks also existed (for the lively debate about banking and the economy in
four th-centur y Athens, Millett 1991 and E. Cohen 1992). On Delos much of the
business of keeping money was entrusted to a series of private bankers in the early
second centur y (ID 442A1±55). A loan made by a banker on Lemnos is attested by a
`horos of the land and house and the things belonging to the land and the house
hypothecated to the banker Agathokles son of Philippos and to Polyphilos son of
Archedemos (of the Athenian deme of) Halai, for 200 drachmas, silver, for the tomb
of Hedea, to have and control according to the contract kept by Drakontides son of
Archagathos of Phearrio' (Beschi 1992±3: 263). The purpose of the loan may have
been to finance the tomb or funeral rites, though this is not made explicit. Loans by
private individuals and private groups are also attested. Many of the loans recorded on
The Economy 341



the Athenian security horoi (brief texts inscribed on stones and placed by hypothe
cated proper ty to show that the proper ty secured a loan; Lalonde inAgora 19: 18±21;
Finley 1985) were granted by private individuals. Interest-free loans could be pro
vided by eranoi: ad hoc groups who lent to an individual for a specific need. A number
of such loans are attested in Athens in the 330s for the manumission of slaves (e.g.,
IG 2
2
.1553.20±3, etc.) and in horoi (e.g., IG 2
2
.2721).
Maritime loans formed a special categor y. Two documents preser ve terms in whole
or in par t of such loans. The most complete is embedded in a speech delivered in
Athens in the 340s ([Dem.] 35.10±13). In it an Athenian and a citizen of Kar ystos, a
town on Euboia, lent 3000 drachmas to two men from Phaselis on the south coast of
Asia Minor for a trip from Athens into the Black Sea and back. The loan, secured on
the cargo of the ship, which was to be wine bought at Mende, carried an interest rate
of 25 per cent, or 30 per cent if they left after Arktouros rose in mid-September
(Mor ton 2001: 259). The loan was to be repaid within twenty days of return to
Athens, except on cargo jettisoned by common decision of the crew or goods taken
by enemies. The lenders had full power to extract from the borrowers' proper ty to
recover any monies owed under the contract but not paid. Another, similar loan,
though couched in somewhat enigmatic language (Bogaer t 1965: 146±54), dates to
the second centur y and was str uck at Alexandria (Wilcken 1925; V Âe lissaropoulos
1980: 308±10). These texts dif fer from more ordinar y, land-based loans in many
par ticulars, but most notably because the lenders could not control the proper ty that
secured the loans and because the loans did not need to be repaid unless the trip was
successful; in this respect they shaded into a kind of insurance, their function also as a
source of capital cannot be forgotten (Bresson 2003: 158±61).
It has long been argued whether private non-maritime loans were made for
`productive' or `consumptive' ends. Finley believed that most were destined for
consumption, many as dowries for the proper ty owners' daughters. In an inscription
from Mykonos we can see explicitly how proper ty was used for this purpose: `Kallix
enos has given his daughter Timekrate to Rhodokles and as dowr y 700 drachmas, of
this 300 as clothing; Rhodokles agrees that he has the clothing and 100 drachmas,
but for 300 drachmas Kallixenos has hypothecated the house in the city to which the
house of Ktesidemos son of Chairelas is neighbour' ( SIG
3
1215.15±20). But there
can be no doubt that loans were also put to `productive' ends. Several Athenianhoroi
attest to the hypothecation of productive assets, as for example an Athenian horos
taken on a workshop (ergasterion) and the slaves who worked in it (SEG 32.236,
c
. 350). The emporika daneia granted by the Milesian public bank have already been
mentioned; whether these were maritime loans, as some have thought, or land-based,
their name makes their purpose clear.
The polis
The polis remained a vibrant and fundamental institution in Greece and western Asia
Minor throughout the Hellenistic period (Billows, this volume). The polis was
marked by cer tain fundamental features: in par ticular, from an economic point of
view, tight linkage between the urban centre (the asty) and its associated agricultural
hinterland (the chora), and a clear distinction between citizens (politai), who enjoyed
full access (if male and adult) to the protection of the state, and non-citizen residents
(metoikoi, `metics', paroikoi, and other terms: Papazoglou 1997) and visitors (some
342 Gary Reger



times called xenoi). These characteristics helped to mark out each polis as a distinct
economic unit, which never theless interacted with outsiders in the form of trade and
exchange. But these features of the polis were not uniform over time and space, and
some changes can be seen in the course of the Hellenistic period. Here I would like to
focus on three issues: the relationship between the polis and its rural hinterland;
taxation and other forms of income and spending; and the growing role of non
citizens in economic life in at least some poleis.
The economic life and health of all poleis was closely linked to agricultural produc
tion in the territor y. Not only did most citizens of the polis farm, but the city itself,
whether directly or through public sanctuaries, owned agricultural estates that were
leased out (e.g., Delos: Reger 1994b: 189±238; Charre and Le Dinahet-Couilloud
1999; Thespiai: Sosin 2000; Athens: Behrend 1970; Mylasa: I.Mylasa 201±32, 801±
54; Dignas 2000; 2002: 95±106). A polis might express its control over such proper
ties, which could be impor tant sources of income, through the terms of leases; a late
four th-centur y lease from Arkesine on Amorgos stipulated that the renter of a sacred
estate `shall apply each year 150 measures of manure, in a wicker basket holding one
medimnos 4 hemiekta. If he does not apply, he shall pay 3 obols per basket. He shall
make a pledge before the neopoiai, that he has indeed applied the manure according
to the lease' (IG 12.7.62.20±5).
Control of the hinterland meant defining as precisely as possible its boundaries,
especially with regard to neighbouring states. The Thessalian towns Ambrakia and
Charadros appointed three (?) commissioners each to set the boundaries between the
cities:
Let them proceed to the land star ting at the corner of the wall, just as prescribed in the
written agreement, and let them set boundar y-markers just as the agreement orders
wherever seems good to both sides, and let them measure the distances from the walls of
the polis of the Ambrakians so as to proceed toward the marker at the hilltop, measuring
anything else they need to measure by distance from this marker . . . . (Charneux and
Tr Â eheux 1988)
The economic interests that coloured boundar y disputes appear for example in the
long-standing dispute between Priene and Samos over the control of territor y from
which the Samians derived par t of their public grain supply ( I.Priene 37; IG
12.6.172.23±7). Boundaries might be studded with for tifications and patrolled by
troops (Ober 1985; Habicht 1997: 137; Rousset 1999; Ma 2000b; Baker 2000),
even along borders that technically ceased to exist after the political unification of two
neighbouring towns (Schmitt 1994; Rousset 1999).
The basic tax, known already from the Classical period, was the `contribution', the
eisphora, an impost on personal for tunes, typically imposed at times of special need
(Migeotte 2000: 164±5; 2002: 41±2). Indirect taxes of various kinds were perhaps
more common and formed the chief basis of polis income. The pentekoste has already
been mentioned. An inscription from Teos in Ionia gives a sense of the range of such
taxes, from which cer tain new citizens were exempted for four years: thechoregia, the
boegia, the lampadarchia, all taxes connected with civic festivals; the taxes on plough
oxen and on pack animals and slaves involved in the wood trade; taxes on sheep or
pigs; the tax that suppor ted the public doctor; the taxes on the production of clothing
The Economy 343



made from Milesian wool and on purple-dyeing; and the taxes on gardens and
beehives (J. and L. Rober t 1976; Austin 99). Taxes were often collected not directly
but through tax-farming: private individuals bought the right to collect a cer tain tax,
earning a profit from the dif ference between the purchase price and the amount
actually collected. An inscription from Kos (which is not complete) lists sale of taxes
on grain, wine, bread, gardens, wood, prostitutes, rental houses, women slaves
(probably again used for prostitution), vineyards and many other goods and ser vices
(SIG
3 1000; Pleket 1964: no. 23).
Fines for violation of all kinds of laws were imposed by all cities. Towards the end of
the second centur y the Amphyktiony that controlled the sanctuar y of Apollo at
Delphi legislated a fine of 200 drachmas for persons violating a currency law, half
going to the individual who denounced the of fender, the balance to the polis (SIG
3
729). Poleis also obtained income through rental proper ty, whether on real estate
owned directly by the polis or by a sanctuar y. Poleis had recourse also to loans from
various sources. In the early third centur y the sanctuar y of Zeus Olympios at Lokroi
Epizephyrioi lent money to the city on several occasions and issued regulations to
guarantee that it would recover money owed by defaulting debtors if third par ties
bought proper ty belonging to them (Bogaert 1976: no. 33±4). The Argives,
in desperate need, borrowed 100 talents from the Rhodians to repair their fortifica
tion walls and fill the ranks of their cavalr y (ISE 1.40; Migeotte 1984: no. 19).
Loans from private persons are attested at Olbia in the Black Sea, Halikarnassos and
Arkesine on Amorgos (Migeotte 1984: nos. 43, 103, 49; IG 12.7.67B). Subunits of
the polis lent money too. The Koan deme of Antimacheia honoured two sacred
treasurers (hierotamiai) who `provided the deme with many great benefits, and,
when the money which the polis owed was repaid during their term of of fice,
had care that it be lent out with suitable hypothecations and added monies of
their own so that the deme's incomes should grow . . .' (Paton and Hicks 1891: no.
383).
Finally, poleis received gifts, whether from their own citizens and residents in the
form of voluntar y contributions or from kings or other high of ficials (Migeotte 1992;
Bringmann and von Steuben 1995). In the aftermath of the ear thquake that devas
tated southwestern Asia Minor in 199/8, King Antiochos III and his wife Laodike
contributed money and grain to the town of Iasos. In addition and on her own
Laodike ordered the conveyance to Iasos for ten years of 1000medimnoi of grain, the
sale of which would provide dowries for girls of poor families (I.Iasos 4; Ma 1999:
180±2, 329±35 no. 26). Perhaps the most famous of such gifts came from a host of
kings to Rhodes after the ear thquake of 227/6 that toppled the famous Colossus
(Polyb. 5.88.90± 4). But some gifts created civic income. Around 299
Antiochos, the eldest son of King Seleukos . . . seeing his own father exer ting ever y ef fort
on behalf of the sanctuar y at Didyma (near Miletos) . . . promises to construct a stoa one
stadion (approximately 200 m) in length for the god (Apollo) in the city from which
there shall be derived ever y year income, which he thinks ought to be spent for works
under taken in the sanctuar y at Didyma, and the structures built with these revenues shall
be his own dedications. (OGIS 213; Bringmann and von Steuben 1995: 338± 41 no.
281; trans. Burstein 2)
344 Gar y Reger



Even more impre ssive , perhap s, was the gi ft to Miletos in the second c entur y of
160,000 medimnoi of grain and the necessar y wood to build a gymnasium (Her r
mann 1965b: 71±90 no. 1; Bringmann and von St euben 1995: 346±8 no. 284 trans.
Burstein 40). At a rough estimate of 5±10 drachmas per medimnos for wheat (Reger
1993: 305 Table 1, 312±14), this gift rep resented 800, 000±1, 600,000 drachm as, or
133±266 talent s.
Civic incom e becam e civi c budg et. C ities had many exp enses ± salarie s for public
of ficials, pay for attendance of public functions like the assembly ( I.Iasos 20.5±7;
Gauthie r 1990), pub lic buildi ng proj ects, esp ecially in sa nctuaries (see Bur ford 1969
for Epidau ros), purc hase and upkeep of public slave s, financin g of mil itar y operat ions,
to name only a few . How annual ± or longer ter m ± budgets were drawn up is a
dif ficult topic. An inscript ion from Ilio n of 7 7 BC
shows the city planning to make
adjust ments in expendi tures auth orized cur rent ly aga inst future incom e when the
actual amou nt of that income becomes known ( SEG 4.664; Pleket 1964: no. 36). In
late four th o r early third cent ur y Oropos diver ted `all fund s' of the city `for the
repaymen t o f mon ey bor ro wed for the (fo r tific ation) walls, except mon ey for sacred
matters, for salaries of the financ ial of ficers ( hyperetai), and for any other civic
expenditure set by law or decree' (Petrakos 1997: 210±1 , no. 302 [ SEG 16.295]).
Greek poleis had always had inhabitants who were not citizens and whose ability to
par ticipa te in the econo mic life of the city was c or respondingl y lim ited. In the four th
centur y the Athenian Xenophon in his Por oi of fered suggestions for expanding the
access of such foreigners to Athenian economic life, and the establishment of dikai
emporikai to which foreign merchants had access was a concrete step in that direction
(VÂ elissarop oulos 1980: 235±67; T odd 1993: 334±7). The Helleni stic period shows
many exam ples of n on-citizens' increased ac cess to the political, social and econo mic
life of the poleis. Groups for med at Lindos on Rhodes for economic and social
purposes included non-citiz ens (e.g. Lindos 300a4±6, 384b15±16; Gabrielsen
2001a: 223). Delians owne d land within the ter ritor y of the neighbo uring polis of

Forms of inter-state co-operation
The Helleni stic period saw the dev elopment o r elabor ation of a number of mechan
isms to tight en links betwe en poleis and to facilitate inter actions betwe en them. Most
of the se institution s exist ed in earlier time s, but became increa sing ly common in this
period. Their sole purpo se was not econo mic ± typi cally polit ical and social goals
predom inated ± b ut in many ca ses the y had impor tant econo mic consequ ence s.
Proxenia was the granting of honours by one state to a citizen or citizens of
anot her . Such award s were ofte n bestowed as a consequ ence of political acti ons
(ser ving as a foreig n judg e or a mbassad or; obta ining favours from a sovereig n) but
the ho nours gran ted of ten includ ed econo mic bene fits, su ch as the right to impor t or
expor t goods without paying taxes ( ateleia). Individuals who enjoyed these benefits
may only occasiona lly have availed the mselves, but the y created at least oppor tunities
for econo mic acti vities (Mare k 1 984; Gauthie r 1985).
The Economy 345



Other institutions created ties between states. Grants of asylia, for example, se
cured freedom for sanctuaries from seizures and reprisals; this was a genuinely
Hellenistic institution, as study of the documentar y evidence has shown, though it
had roots in earlier practice. A declaration of asylia kept the sanctuar y safe and
contributed to its role as a locus for economic activity, especially during festivals
(Rigsby 1996). Grants of isopoliteia, which allowed citizens of one polis to become
citizens of another, and declarations of sympoliteia, which created new political units
where there had before been separate polities, facilitated economic interchange
between poleis (Gawantka 1975; Reger 2004). A good recent example of the benefits
and the care with which cities entered into such agreements appears in an isopoliteia
agreement between Xanthos and Myra in L ykia (Bousquet and Gauthier 1994:
319± 47).
Hellenistic kingdoms
The economic activities of the great territorial kingdoms of the Hellenistic period
related for the most par t to their chief preoccupation: war (Austin 1986). Recent
study of the taxation and coinage practices of the Seleukid kingdom, the largest by far
of the successor states, has shown that almost all of taxes collected and money coined
can be accounted for by reference to militar y costs (Aperghis 2001; cf. Papagopoulou
2000, 2001 on Antigonos Gonatas with analogous conclusions). The coinages of
Mithradates VI can be ver y tightly correlated to the rhythms of his militar y activity
against the Romans (de Callatay È 2000: 355±9). The costs of war were considerable.
Hellenistic armies were largely mercenar y. Pay rates attested in inscriptions suggest
that mercenaries might be paid roughly 6±8 obols/day (Attic standard; see still the
useful discussion in Grif fith 1935: 294±307). The costs associated with a major
conflict, like the battle of Raphia in 217 when 75,000 Ptolemaic troops faced
68,000 Seleukid (according to Polyb. 5.79), were an exceptional strain, but the
troops in garrisons on Thera or in Delphi needed their pay too; troops surrendering
at Theangela in Karia insisted on their four months' back pay (L. Rober t 1936: 69±86
no. 52). Aside from soldiers' salaries, Hellenistic kings built and maintained fleets;
secured corps of elephants and their handlers; suppor ted weapons workshops; built,
repaired and staf fed for tifications; and founded cities peopled with ex-soldiers
intended to provide local security and forces that could be called upon in case of
need (Migeotte 2000; Baker 2000; Aperghis 2001).
It is no wonder, with the fiscal demands on their treasuries, that kings imposed
broad tax burdens on their subjects. In an inscription from Herakleia in Karia, the
king exempts citizens from taxes on bringing things in and out, on produce of the
land, on pasturage dues for bees and herds (time and number of animals to be
determined), taxes on grain impor ted into the city and taxes on goods brought
into the city from royal land, whether for personal use or resale (W È o r rle 1988; Ma
1999: 340±5 no. 31). This considerable range of taxes over which royal authority
extended finds its echo in a phrase that recurs in many honorar y decrees from poleis
under royal authority. When recipients were awarded tax exemption,ateleia, the polis
was often careful to add, `from taxes over which the polis has authority' (I.Iasos 37.8±
9 and many other texts; Gauthier 1991).

Money
The reasons for the or igin of coine d money (invented in Asia Minor in the Archaic
period) and its functi ons througho ut antiqu ity have long been debated (the cur rent
discussion star ts from How gego 1990; see now de C allatay È 2000: 341± 4; for the
technolo gy , Rihll 2001). A recen t view argu es that states star te d to coin because the y
saw ways to profi t from coinin g; soon ther eafter came the exp loitation of coins ± with
their disti nctive emble ms denot ing the issuing auth ority , the `type ' ± fo r purpose s of
self-asser tion and propag anda (Le Ride r 2001;
contra
T . Mar tin 1985). From an
econo mic point of vie w , tw o great inter ests o f the state (wheth er Hell enistic king dom
or
polis
) in coins lay in their use fo r payment , par ticular ly of expense s associat ed with
war and bureauc racy , and incom e, in taxes and other recei pts (boot y , indem nities,
etc.). The second great question for the histo rian is the degr ee to which coins
mon etarized the econo my , that is to say , the degree to which exchange s came to be
conduct ed exclus ively , or alm ost exclusiv ely , in coined mon ey . Rel ated to this ques
tion is wheth er coinin g ent ities ± the
poleis
o r the Helleni stic king doms ± recognize d
this role for the coins they str u ck and coine d explicitly to facilitat e exchang e.
In the Classical period, Athenian coins with the owl as the obve rse ty pe set the
standa rd for coins througho ut the Aegean worl d; the y wer e, in Plato's phra se, the
`common Greek coinage ' (
Laws
742a). Str uck from highly pure silver , the y ad hered
to a we ight standa rd of 4.2± 4.3 g. for a drachm a, or 16.8 ±17. 3 for a tetradrac hma.
Other weight standard s and othe r coinag es of cours e exist ed, b ut when Alexande r the
Great decid ed to issue coinage , he chose the Attic standa rd. These coins ± Alexande r
str uck issues in gold as we ll ± and similar ones iss ued by his su ccessors (the L ysima
choi, for exam ple), becam e ex traordinar ily popul ar . Many entit ies issued copies and
they we re ofte n exp licitly demande d for payment (M. Price 1989; Knoe pfler 19 97).
These coinage s circulated widely alongs ide the issues of smaller stat es, whi ch were
often more confine d in the ir circulat ion, and seem to have ser ved the bulk o f the need
of the econo my for money for about a centur y (see d e C allatay È in de Callat a È y ,
Depe yrot and V illaron ga 1993: 13± 46). In the second cent ur y ± the date remains
uncle ar ± the A thenians beg an to strike a new coinage , the so-calle d New Style
Coinage (M. Thompson 1961). By 145 the A thenians were striki ng this coinage
annuall y , and it was accepted wid ely , like Athe ns' coinag es o f earlier times. At the
same time , many
poleis
cont inued to strike their own coins, in silver or bronz e or
both , and some larger entit ies, notably the Ptolema ic and the Perg amene kingdom s,
rejecte d the standa rd Att ic co inage and created their own `closed' econo mic zones
based on a coinage at a reduce d we ight standa rd (Kleiner and Noe 1 977; Mùrkho lm
1982; but see on `closed economy ' the caveat of Davi es 1984: 279).
6 How Monetarized Was the Economy?
For cer tain larg e-scale paym ents, there is no doubt that the econo my was entirely
mon etarized in, or by , the Hell enistic period. Payment s to troops we re made exclu
sively or ess entially in coine d money . As early as 347 at Del phi a general of Phokis
str uck coins from precious me tal dedic ations at the sa nctuar y of Apollo to pay his
troops, who clearly wanted coine d mon ey , not even bullion (Diod . 16.56 .5±8). Th e
The Economy
347



treaty between Rhodes and Hierapytna on Crete regulating the supplying of soldiers
stipulates payment of salar y in money (IC 3.3.3A26±9). War indemnities were often
paid in coin as well. It has recently been suggested that the New Style Athenian
coinage may have been introduced as currency for the payment of the Aitolian
indemnity to Rome after the end of their war in 189; at least, the terms of the treaty
preser ved in Polybios state explicitly that the Aitolians are to pay in `coinage not
worse than Attic' (21.32.8, cf. 21.43.19±22 for the indemnity imposed on Antiochos
III in 188; Dreyer 2000). Be that as it may, a series of countermarks ± stamps added
to existing coins by some third par ty ± on coins issued in various cities of Pamphylia
and eastern L ykia in the 180s have been argued to represent the payment of a war
indemnity by Antiochos III to Eumenes II, king of Pergamon, imposed by the treaty
of 188 that ended the war between Antiochos and Rome and its allies, including
Eumenes (Bauslaugh 1990). Sulla ordered Lucullus to collect the 20,000 talent
indemnity imposed on the cities of Asia Minor ± and to coin it (Plut. Luc. 4.1).
Private transactions frequently called for coined money as well. We have seen many
examples in the course of this chapter. A series of inscriptions from Amorgos
recording loans by private persons to the Amorgian poleis reveals something of the
expectations of the nature of the coins that private persons might want: a clause in
one contract stipulates repayment in `Attic or Alexandreian coinage which the city
uses besides the Attic, of full weight, legal, not subject to seizure, unencumbered, free
of all taxes' (Migeotte 1984: 168±77 no. 49.20±1; Picard 1996). The reference to
`Attic' and `Alexandreian' money (the latter coinage on the Attic standard issued by
Alexander himself or, more commonly, by his successors or other authorities in his
name and sometimes bearing his image) reflects the emergence of Attic-standard
coinage as the `common currency' of the Hellenistic world often preferred for
payments to foreigners. But poleis continued to strike their own coins for local use,
often of different or lighter weight standards. Such coins may have dominated local
exchange for locally produced and sold goods and ser vices (Marcellesi 2000 with
Picard 1996).
The role of money in small-scale exchanges is illustrated by coinage in `bronze'
(actually copper alloys). First struck in the late fifth and early four th centur y, bronze
coinage became widespread in the Hellenistic period (Picard 1998: 9); at Athens, for
example, an entire mint building was devoted to the production of bronze coins
(Camp and Kroll 2001). There is plenty of evidence for cash payments in small sums.
On Delos the sanctuar y sold eggs laid by the sacred geese for as little as 3 obols (we
are not told how many eggs this sum bought) or two geese for 4.5 obols (IG
11.2.287A17). A phiale apparently used for small cash offerings brought in amounts
as small as a quar ter of an obol (IG 11.2.287A17±25). Some of these payments may
have been made in small silver, which was no doubt more common than finds suggest
(Behrend 1984). But at Thasos, we know of payments made in small change in
bronze (Picard 1994). In the four th centur y, we are told, Timotheos struck bronze
to replace silver so that he could pay troops, but he guaranteed this coinage for the
suspicious merchants (emporoi and agoraioi) with silver ([Arist.] Oec. 1351a1). The
Sestos decree of a little before 120 B C makes plain this city's motivations for coining
in bronze: `so that the city's coin type should be used as a current type and the people
(demos) should receive the profit resulting from this source of revenue' (I.Sestos 1;
OGIS 339.44±5, trans. Austin 215; Le Rider 2001: 242±7).
348 Gary Reger



But it would be a mistake to suppose that all exchange was conducted exclusively in
coins. Bar ter and other non-monetarized exchanges persisted (Le Rider 1993±94:
815±19), and many people must have exchanged with their neighbours on such
bases, like the farmer in Alkiphron who pleads for a loan of grain. We cannot quantify
these sectors of economic activity. We can only say that the activity most visible to us ±
large-scale public and private exchanges, trade over long distances, and the like ±
seems pretty thoroughly monetarized, and that the spread of bronze coinage from the
four th centur y clearly enabled the monetarization of all kinds of small-scale exchanges
which would have been harder to conduct before. The popularity of bronze issues
and the measures poleis took to protect confidence in them makes it clear that
ordinar y people enjoyed the convenience of carr ying out even the smallest market
exchanges with money (on the Archaic and Classical periods, cf. Kim 2001).
7 Did States Have `Economic Policies'?
A famous inscription from Teos in Ionia records the terms under which King
Antigonos Monophthalmos sought to unite Teos and its neighbour Lebedos into
a single entity. In the negotiating back and forth between the king and his subjects,
the Lebedeans asked for the right to impor t grain. Antigonos expressed his
reluctance:
Previously we were unwilling that any city should undertake the impor tation of corn or
maintain a (subsidised) grain supply, for we were not willing to have the cities spend for
this purpose large sums of money unnecessarily; we did not wish even now to give this
permission, for the crown land is near and if a need of grain arose, we think there could
easily be brought from there whatever one wishes. (RC 3±4, trans. Welles; Austin 40)
Antigonos claims that his sole interest here is to avoid unnecessar y expense and to
enable the cities to `become free of debt', for, he says, `there is no private profit for us
in the business'. That Greek cities under the Seleukid kings had to obtain permission
to impor t grain, however, is well attested in many documents. The practice has
recently been explained as a continuity from the policies of the Achaimenid kings
who ruled Asia Minor before Alexander. The matter in fact is treated in theOecono
mica attributed to Aristotle (2.1.3 with Briant 1994b). There, the kings clearly are
eager to be able to sell off excess goods such as grain which have been produced on
their behalf but which are surplus to the needs of army and cour t. This clarifies the
source of the grain and other goods, par ticularly agricultural goods but also wood
products originating from the kings' great forest holdings (Gauthier 1989: 22±33),
that the kings had at their disposal to give to places like Iasos and Rhodes. Other wise,
conversion into money provided all the more cash needed to hire mercenaries and
keep up a cour t. In this respect the Seleukids clearly did have a kind of economic
policy, and Antigonos' avowal of complete disinterest may be taken with a cer tain
irony. But we must remember at the same time that the fundamental policy interest of
the great Hellenistic kings was to stoke their armies. The need to provide booty for
redistribution to maintain loyalty led to a self-reinforcing cycle of war fare that helps
to explain many of the large-scale features of the period (Billows 1995; but see
Billows 1990: 286±91 for a dif ferent reading of Antigonos' economic policy).
The Economy 349



Antigonos' reluctance to let go of a mechanism for generating cash takes on a new
meaning in this context.
The Ptolemies of Egypt provide a rather dif ferent example. As is well known,
elephants became an impor tant feature of war fare in the Hellenistic period. To
compete with their Seleukid rivals, the Ptolemies developed an infrastr ucture to
capture elephants in Africa for shipment back to the Nile valley. Early on this activity
was routed through the nor th end of the Red Sea and a canal of Achaimenid date
re-opened by the kings. But the nor thern Red Sea was dif ficult to navigate, and by the
middle of the third centur y Ptolemy II had established a network of settlements on
the mid- and southern Red Sea shore. These connected to the Nile via deser t caravan
routes leading from Berenike and Myos Hormos (Alcock et al., this volume). As early
as 255 a papyr us mentions an of ficial charged with `the conveyance of elephants into
the Thebaid' (Mitteis and Wilcken 1912 1(2).513±15 col. II.78±80). In the later
Ptolemaic period and especially under Roman r ule, trade in luxur y goods ± spices,
frankincense, ivor y, tor toise shells, pearls, etc. ± flourished in this region, funnelled
into Alexandria for redistribution to the Mediterranean world. Some of the trade
goods are mentioned in a famous inscription of `Soterichos . . . who has been dis
patched by Paos, relative [of the king: a title] and general of the Thebaid, for the
collection of precious stones and in charge of the ships and to provide security for
those who convey from the harbour at Koptos cargoes of frankincense and other
foreign goods' (Bernand 1977: 253±61 no. 86). The linkage between the elephant
trade of the third centur y and this text (along with other evidence) has led to the view
that the Ptolemies pursued an ar ticulated mercantile policy on the Red Sea and Indian
Ocean. The por ts on the Red Sea and the caravan routes to the Nile of fered an entr Âe e
to a wider region. The result, according to some, followed from a plan of the
Ptolemies to create a mercantile policy based on the trade in luxuries and a royal
monopoly on their sale. But, as has recently been stressed, this picture leaves out the
fundamental royal interest in the third centur y (elephant hunting), the discontinuities
in the political life of the kingdom (especially the great Thebaid revolt; Thompson,
this volume, section 5), and, perhaps most impor tant, the role of indigenous Red Sea
and Indian Ocean merchants in running the trade (de Romanis 1996: 121±46).
Here, rather than a royal mercantile policy, it is better to see the trade in luxur y
items as an adventitious growth on an infrastr ucture put in place for the elephant
trade.
So much for the `big kingdoms'. What about ordinar y
poleis
? A congeries of
evidence can be cited to suggest a kind of mercantile policy for the island
polis
of
Thasos. Thasos was famous in antiquity for the production of wine. A series of laws,
whose interpretation is not always easy, regulated the wine trade (Salviat 1986). Wine
was expor ted in transpor t amphorae which have been recovered in enormous quan
tities all over the eastern Mediterranean, but with par ticular concentration in the
Black Sea region (Garlan 1999). Exploration of the Thasian countr yside has revealed
many farms, often with distinctive towers attached to the farm complex (Osborne
1986) and
ateliers
where the amphorae were made (Garlan 1999: 2±4). Put together,
this evidence suggests that the Thasians concentrated on the production of wine for
expor t to the non-Greek kingdoms of the Black Sea, and that the Thasian state
sought to regulate and promote this trade (Picard 1994). This is no surprise as the
people who owned the wine orchards were cer tainly also the wealthy elite who
350
Gary Reger



controlled political life on Thasos. For example, there is good evidence to suppose
that the family that used the names Pylades and Demes, who produced amphorae,
included members who ser ved as priest of Demeter Eleusinia and as theoros, a high
Thasian official (Garlan 1999: 46±7). But in all this there is one curious feature. After
about 310 and until the 180s the Thasians stopped coining in silver. All their issues in
those decades were bronzes intended for local, internal use. How did they manage
foreign trade and accumulation of wealth without silver coinage? Like many others in
the Hellenistic world, they relied on the abundant `common Greek coinage' (Plato
Laws 742a) issued as Alexanders, L ysimachoi and a few other types on the Attic
weight standard (M. Price 1989; Mùrkholm 1991; Marcellesi 2000).
I leave aside other, well-known examples of possible policies, such as that of
Kleomenes of Naukratis in Egypt (Le Rider 1997).
8 The Impact of Rome
From about 200, the Romans were a constant presence in the Hellenistic world.
Roman armies and navies contested control of small poleis and great territorial
kingdoms; they defeated the Aitolians, the Antigonids and the Seleukids; they
inherited the kingdom of the Ptolemies; they created new structures for imperial
control, and ultimately brought the entire Hellenistic world more or less up to the
Euphrates under their authority (chapters 4±6 above). With the militar y came traders,
tax collectors, loan sharks, settlers (militar y colonists at Corinth), students (Cicero's
son at Athens), and a host of others, whether Romans or Italians. Eventually, after a
horrible period of civil wars that devastated much of the Greek world, came peace ±
marked symbolically and in fact by, among other things, the emperor Augustus'
leisurely tour of the East and the commissions of his trusted subordinate Agrippa
to tr y to clean things up.
This subject is far too big to cover here in any kind of systematic or complete way;
that would take a book. Rather, we shall look at a few topics with the question in
mind, to what degree did the coming of Rome af fect the structures and character of
the Hellenistic economy?
Keith Hopkins has of fered a model for describing one way in which Roman
inter vention may have af fected the Hellenistic east. Hopkins argued that the wealth
brought into the Italian peninsula by successful militar y operations in the Greek east
was reinvested largely in land in Italy. Since the investors were large landowners, not
proprietar y farmers, they worked the land with slave labour. A major source of slaves
was war captives. Positive feedback loops generated increased pressure for warfare as
the source of new wealth and new slaves, and the reinvestment of this wealth
transformed the economic and social landscape of Italy, forming an impor tant com
ponent of the Social War and the collapse of the Roman Republic in the first centur y
(Hopkins 1978: 1±98). Whatever subsequent research has made of this view, it
deser ves consideration if only as an attempt to model and explain economic change.
Hopkins' interests focused largely on the impact in Italy, but it is not hard to see how
constant Roman militar y exercises in the Greek east might have transformed the
economy.
Indeed, texts of the first centur y especially are full of evidence of the dislocations,
disruptions and impoverishment that warfare, particularly the civil wars, but also wars
The Economy 351



of `resistance' to Roman rule, had on the Greek world. An inscription from Mylasa in
Karia recounts the suf fering of that city attacked in 40 B C by Labienus, a Roman
rebel: the city was captured, many citizens were taken prisoner and others had been
killed, fires burnt in the city, and `the enemies' brutality did not keep away from the
holiest temples or sanctuaries' (I.Mylasa 602; Canali De Rossi 2000: 172±8).
Examples could easily be multiplied, and lead to the inference that the Greek east
suf fered terribly in the last centur y, not least from having typically picked, or been
forced to pick, the wrong side in conflicts from the First Mithradatic War to the war
between Octavian and Mark Antony and Kleopatra.
Another realm in which the impact of Roman rule may appear is civic finances. The
Romans imposed war indemnities and other payments on the Greeks. These were
collected by Roman tax farmers, who often profited from their contracts by lending
money at high interest rates to impecunious cities. Public inscriptions attest to the
kindness of some of these figures. In the first centur y L. Aufidius Bassus wrote of f
par t of a large civic debt owed by the island of Tenos to his father and then to him and
reduced interest on others debts (IG 12.5.860); the brothers Cloatii were honored in
71 for lending large sums to the city of Gytheion (SIG
3 748). Literar y texts are
blunter. Most famous is the incident in which Cicero became involved with Roman
financiers tr ying to collect a huge debt from Salamis on Cyprus (Cic.Att. 5.21.10±13
Migeotte 1984: no. 75). But examples are widespread. Paintings were removed
from Sikyon to Rome to pay of f a public debt (Pliny HN 35.127 Migeotte 1984:
no. 18). Apollonia tried to avoid paying civic debts with a bribe (Cic. Pis. 86
Migeotte 1984: no. 35). A series of towns in Karia owed Clodius money and failed in
their obligations (Cic. Fam. 13.56.1±3 Migeotte 1984: no. 106). The list could
easily be expanded.
Clearly Roman entr y into the Greek east had impor tant economic ef fects, includ
ing many not treated here; perhaps most notably the massive infusion of Italian and
Roman traders, tax farmers and others whose presence helped spark the First Mithra
datic War. Surely, however, one large and impor tant consequence of Roman hegem
ony was an increased linkage of the eastern Mediterranean with the west. The flow of
goods and people in both directions, but especially toward Italy, played out in the first
few centuries of the common era, when a truly Mediterranean-wide economic sphere
can be said to have emerged. But that is another stor y.

This is an exciting time to study the Hellenistic economy. A decade or two ago the
student interested in learning more would first have been directed to M. I. Finley's
The Ancient Economy, the prevailing theoretical study of the economy of the Greco
Roman world, where she would have found disappointingly little about the Hellenis
tic period (a few words at p. 183; see Davies 2001: 11±14). Then would have come

place to begin to see how sur vey archaeology can be interpreted than Alcock 1993,
although her interests range far beyond the economy
per se
. The discoveries of the
archaeologists have yet to be fully integrated into our picture of the economy, but a
sense of what such work might look like can be found, in par t, in Rousset 1999. And
as comprehensive studies of amphora like Garlan's magnificent corpus-in-progress for
Thasos (1999) appear, we may finally be able to begin to integrate this impor tant but
dif ficult categor y of evidence into our understanding of the economic (and indeed
political and social) life of the Hellenistic world (for an example of what might be
done, Finkielsztejn 2001a). The economic life of Babylonia and the east has been

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
Reading the Landscape:
Survey Archaeology and the
Hellenistic Oikoumene
Susan E. Alcock, Jennifer E. Gates and Jane
E. Rempel
A fascinating, if somewhat humbling, exercise is the honest assessment of how far the
nature of our sources dictate the questions we ask, and the framework we use, to
analyse a historical period. For the Hellenistic age, a heavy reliance on textual
evidence, and principally Greek textual evidence at that, long tilted scholarly perspec
tives on the Hellenistic oikoumene, or `inhabited world'. We once perceived that world
as fundamentally transformed by the arrival of Hellenic culture, as deeply divided
from whatever had come before, as a newly created and somehow homogeneous
entity (Droysen 1887±88; Rostovtzef f 1941: 1040; Tarn and Grif fith 1952: 3).
It is not news to announce that such perspectives are, to a great extent, misguided,
that (to present-day eyes) they appear the somewhat absurd product of a par ticular
and limited reading of a par ticular and limited body of evidence (see the criticisms of,
among others, PrÂ eaux 1978: 5±9; Briant 1982: 7±12; Kuhr t and Sher win White
1987). Such attitudes have been assailed from many directions: in par ticular, through
a theoretical sea-change in our conception of the relationships possible between
Greek and non-Greek peoples, through the addition of native voices in languages
other than Greek, and through the more wide-ranging use and sensitive analysis of
archaeological data. This chapter speaks to one distinctive and increasingly attractive
approach to the Hellenistic world ± the contribution of sur vey (or landscape) archae
ology ± through the presentation of three diverse regional case studies.
1 Landscape, Survey and the Hellenistic World
Landscape is a dif ficult concept to define but an extremely useful one to employ. In
current archaeological analysis, `landscape' revolves around human experience, per
ception and modification of the world. All aspects of human activity ± settlement
patterns, boundaries, ritual sites, roads, monuments, burial places ± together with



their intersection with the natural world, are bound up in the concept, which also
highlights emotional ties to par ticular places and the memories invested within them
(Bender 1993; Hirsch and O'Hanlon 1995; Basso and Feld 1996; Shipley and
Salmon 1996; Ashmore and Knapp 1999). Landscape offers a means by which to
assess changing local conditions over time; through it we can obser ve, for example,
the impact of newly constituted political or economic regimes, such as the formation
of the Hellenistic kingdoms.
One principal means to assemble archaeological data at the broader scale required by
the study of landscape (as opposed to individual site-based analysis) is through the
practice of regional sur vey. Archaeological sur vey has taken many forms since its
introduction to the Mediterranean and Near East in the 1950s and 1960s, but increas
ingly it involves the intensive examination of the ear th's sur face, by field teams engaged
in counting, collecting and analysing all traces of cultural debris. Today many other
disciplines contribute to this type of regional study, such as geologists (to warn about
significant geomorphological or riverine changes), botanists (to advise about climatic
alterations), anthropologists (to obser ve how present-day populations interact with
their world), or remote sensing exper ts (for example, to detect ancient patterns of
irrigation or road networks in satellite imager y) (for a wide ranging recent review of
sur vey and ancillar y techniques, see Barker and Mattingly 1999±2000).
While specific sur vey methodologies can var y dramatically, regionally-based pro
jects share cer tain common goals: they aim to gather, in systematic fashion, evidence
for human activity in a defined geographical area over long spans of time (Cherr y
1995; Francovich and Patterson 2000). Categories of evidence (and the inferences
those data make possible) have expanded to include not only the distribution of
human settlement, but land use and land tenure patterns, ritual, ceremonial and
mor tuar y landscapes, and networks of communication and exchange. That expansion
is visible in this chapter's three case studies. One investigates what a consideration of
road networks can reveal; another obser ves the changing interactions of rural com
munities and burials; the third notes the respect paid to prehistoric monuments.
Sur vey is also deliberately diachronic in its coverage; for many of the sur veys con
ducted in the modern countries which once comprised the Hellenistic world, the time
span of interest stretches from Palaeolithic to Early Modern times. From such a
perspective, the Hellenistic period thus appears as only par t of a richly detailed,
long-term histor y in a par ticular region.
We would argue that this landscape approach of fers considerable advantages to the
study of the Hellenistic world, especially as a corrective to the past biases noted at the
outset of this chapter. One benefit, for example, is that it forces us to consider just
how far the Hellenistic age was indeed `newly transformed': just how dif ferent was life
in that period compared to what came before and what would follow? In what senses
was it dif ferent, and to what extent could this be attributed to the workings of
Hellenic culture ± as opposed, for example, to the introduction of new political and
exploitative regimes? Moreover, adopting this perspective willy-nilly embraces all
dwellers in a par ticular landscape: rich and poor, urban and rural, Greek and indigen
ous. Obviously, it is often easier to `see' some of these people than others through
their remaining material traces. Nonetheless, for anyone armed with evidence for
settlement or ritual patterning across an entire region, a single-minded search for `the
Greeks' or `Greek influence' will no longer seem desirable, or even possible.

Finally, numerous locally-based regional studies can test the notion of Hellenistic
uniformity, the impression that this entire (ver y far-flung and diverse) oikoumene
followed similar developmental trajectories. One previous analysis has already con
tested that model; through the comparison of fifty dif ferent regional sur vey projects
(admittedly of var ying quality and intensity), divergent patterns were seen to emerge
across the expanse of the Hellenistic world and beyond (Alcock 1994). The remain
der of this chapter will develop this theme of local distinctiveness. As the existence of
a single, unitar y Hellenistic landscape comes to appear increasingly improbable, we
can instead acknowledge ± and analyse more closely ± the possibility of regional
dif ferentiation. Shared characteristics across the Hellenistic world may yet emerge:
but only as they manifest themselves from the `ground up', and not be assumed from
the `top down'.
What follows are three shor t case studies, drawn from dif ferent par ts of the
Hellenistic world: a peninsular kingdom, an economically strategic deser t, a politically
divided island. These regions dif fer in environmental and ecological terms; they
interacted in various fashions with the major Hellenistic kingdoms; they have been
explored to dif ferent degrees, with dif ferent methodologies. Disparate as they will
appear, what has to be remembered is that they represent only a small fraction of the
diversity covered by what we bravely summarize as `the Hellenistic world'.
2 Social Change and Rural Settlement in the Bosporan Kingdom
1
` . . . here, at the far edge of the ancient world, for the most par t in peculiar conditions,
Greek traditions existed in ver y dif ferent realms of rural life and practice, demonstrat
ing amazing viability, over a long period of time'. With these words A. A. Maslenni
kov (1998: 271) concludes his recent volume on the rural territor y of the Bosporan
kingdom. The author's choice to end on this note is telling: one of the most
fundamental, and problematic, aspects of this Black Sea state was its heterogeneous
population, including the descendants of Greek colonists, Scythians and various
Maeotian groups, as well as the interactions between them. This quasi-Greek king
dom, composed primarily of urban Hellenes and largely rural local populations,
experienced none of the political or territorial upsets we associate with the beginning
of the Hellenistic period, but at first glance it easily agrees with our ideas about
Hellenistic kingdoms. In fact, this `Hellenistic aspect' was the result of a long process
of change that began well before 323 B C ; indeed Minns, in his 1913 opus on
Scythians and Greeks, considered it to be a forerunner of the other Hellenistic
kingdoms (1913: 563).
Located on the nor th coast of the Black Sea at the mouth of the Sea of Azov (figure
21.1), the Bosporan kingdom, which originated as a loose confederation of Greek
colonial poleis in the early fifth centur y B C , was ruled by the Thracian-tinged dynasty
of the Spar tokids from 438/7 until 108/7 B C (when Mithradates VI took over the
kingdom). A key supplier of grain to Greece, and to Athens in par ticular, the
kingdom also prospered from trade with the neighbouring Scythians and Maeotians.
The four th centur y B C , in par ticular, was a period of great wealth, and it is during
this period that the Bosporan kingdom begins to look par ticularly `Hellenistic'. At

this time, the kingdom expanded to include not only the territor y of the Greek
colonies, but also that of the neighbouring populations, and the Spar tokid rulers
began to call themselves `kings' in addition to the title of `archon' they had previously
employed. By the third centur y B C , the rulers used king as their sole title, and even
began to mint coinage that bore their own por traits, much like other Hellenistic
leaders (Hind 1994b: 490, 496±501). Although the settlements of the Bosporan
kingdom had probably always had mixed populations (Tsetskhladze 1998: 45), it is in
the four th centur y that evidence for the incorporation of non-Greek representations
of status and power by the Bosporan elite begins to become especially striking. For
example, large and lavish burial mounds were erected close to the main cities of the
kingdom, clearly recalling the Scythian mounds that already dotted the landscape, but
also allying themselves, through their location, with the Bosporan cultural sphere
(Rempel for thcoming; throughout this section, the term `Bosporan' is used not as a
geographical descriptor, but in reference to all aspects of the kingdom itself). At the
non-elite level, other wise Greek-seeming burials contained Scythian-style weapons,
and local burials incorporated markers of Greek inspiration (Hind 1994b: 506±8).
Greek, Scythian, Maeotian: all elements interacted in this environment, in which
expressions of identity and representations of power could, and did, transcend strict
cultural boundaries. Signals from Greek culture, and from those of the steppe, were
read together, and informed each other, in a decidedly Hellenistic, but uniquely
`Bosporan', frame of reference.
Reading the Landscape 357



This complex cultural mix was echoed in the complex and disjointed landscape of
the kingdom. From Theodosia in the west to Gorgippia in the east, the territor y was
bounded, defined and dissected by water: relatively flat plains were punctuated by a
myriad of bays, lakes and inlets, or alternately swept down to dramatic clif fs at the
shore, or petered out to marshy land. The disunity of this geography lies in stark
contrast to the large vistas it afforded, creating a sense of visual connection and an
awareness of the physical evidence of its occupation histor y. By the four th centur yB C ,
ancient for tification ditches, Scythian burial mounds and long-established trade
routes were juxtaposed with Greek-style agricultural settlements and land-divisions,
charging the landscape with implications of power and control, and structuring
individual experiences within it.
How the territor y of the Bosporan kingdom functioned has always been a question
of impor tance for archaeologists working in this region. Beginning with the 1953
publication of Blavatskii's Agriculture in the Ancient States of the Northern Black Sea Littoral, the rural territories of the kingdom have received considerable attention,
and additional comprehensive studies of settlement patterns, and how they change
through time, have been published more recently (Kruglikova 1975; Paromov 1986,
1989, 1990; Abramov and Paromov 1993; Maslennikov 1998; Scholl and Zin'ko
1999). The sur vey methodology traditionally employed in the investigation of Greek
colonies on the nor th coast of the Black Sea (including the Bosporan kingdom) is
ver y intensive; although systematic fieldwalking is not always employed, the region
has been explored for years through the use of a variety of techniques (including
general topographic reconnaissance, systematic and non-systematic fieldwalking,
aerial photography, and geophysical sur vey, as well as on-site collection of sur face
finds) (e.g. Shcheglov 1983: 18±24; Paromov 1986: 71; 1989: 73; 1990: 161±2;
Maslennikov 1998: 32). These investigations have been primarily concerned with the
ancient Greek and Roman occupation of the territor y, and as a result they have
focused on specific questions: the physical organization of the Greek poleis and the
location of their choras, and ± for the Bosporan kingdom ± its economic and adminis
trative organization, and the distribution of settlements throughout the territor y
under its control.
Although this research has produced a wealth of information and opened up
numerous avenues of research, it remains more of a two-dimensional map of the
archaeological residue of human activity than a consideration of human interaction in
and with the landscape. As Tilley (1994: 9) has warned, when space is viewed as an
abstract stage for human activity, it is `divorced from any consideration of structures
of power and domination . . . divorced from humanity and society'; accordingly, a
conception of landscape as a socially dynamic force must be added to more traditional
economic and political explanations of change. The rural landscape of the Bosporan
kingdom, contested and controlled in various ways, is an ideal forum for investigating
the complex social and cultural dynamics of interaction that informed Bosporan
society. It is ideal, precisely because this same landscape was an active participant in
structuring those interactions, a force in informing social behaviour and in contesting
and negotiating relations of power and dominance.
During the four th and continuing into the third centur y B C , there was a dramatic
increase in the number of settlements constructed in the rural territor y of the
Bosporan kingdom (figure 21.2). Although this territor y had been settled to a cer tain

extent in the sixth centur y B C , when the area was first colonized by the Greeks, this
new `flowering' of settlement marks an impor tant change in the landscape of the
Bosporan kingdom (Kruglikova 1975: 53±101). Farmsteads, similar to those found
in Attica, and small local villages sprang up beside each other; all were caught up in
networks of fortifications and roads. Historically, this development coincides with the
Bosporan annexation of the neighbouring Sindoi and other Maeotian populations,
which first occurred during the reign of Leukon (393/2±354/3 B C ); cer tainly this
reconfiguration of power dynamics in the region had a fundamental impact on
patterns of settlement and land use. It has also been demonstrated that these settle
ments were intimately linked with the administrative and economic system of the
Bosporan kingdom (Maslennikov 1989). This four th centur y `flowering', however, is
also indicative of, and was a par ticipant in, the ever-changing social dynamics of the
kingdom, and ser ves to illuminate the nature of cultural interactions in the region
from a new perspective.
Both sides of the strait witnessed an increase in rural settlement, but an increase
manifested in dif ferent ways (figure 21.2). The eastern Taman peninsula was, during
the classical period, a series of islands, separated by bays and branches of the Kuban
River delta, and the dif ficulty of identifying the ancient coastlines with precision has,
of course, af fected the study of its territor y (Paromov 1986: 71). Nonetheless, much
investigation has been under taken since the end of the eighteenth centur y, and the
settlement organization is well understood (despite the unpublished state of much of
Paromov's work; see Paromov 1986; 1989; 1990; Abramov and Paromov 1993; cf.
Scholl and Zin'ko 1999: 8). From the earliest periods of colonization, rural settle
ments were constructed throughout the Taman peninsula; in the four th to third
centuries, however, the number of such settlements nearly doubled, and they were
united by a more sophisticated network of roads and land plots. It has been postu
lated that almost all of the available land was under cultivation during this period, and
that therefore the local Sindic and Maeotian populations must have been actively
involved in this process, even living in the cities and towns along with the Bosporan
Greeks (Paromov 1989: 78; 1990: 163).
The coastlines of the western Kerch peninsula have also changed (Maslennikov
1998: 16; Scholl and Zin'ko 1999: 11), but not as drastically as those of the Taman
peninsula. For various reasons, exploration of the rural territor y of this par t of the
Bosporan kingdom only began in earnest about 50 years ago, but since then it has
been studied in detail. In contrast to the Taman peninsula, here there was relatively
little rural settlement in the sixth and fifth centuries B C , and it was only in the second
quar ter of the four th centur y that the occupation of the hinterland steeply increased
(figure 21.2). This occupation included Greek-style farmsteads and villas, the intro
duction of land plots in the choras of the poleis, as well as the formation of the
`Bosporan chora' (settlements outside the colonial choras, on `crown land' as it
were). In addition, many small villages were constructed in this period that, judging
by their architecture, finds and frequent grouping near burial mounds, were inhabited
by a local segment of the population (Kruglikova 1975: 54±8, 75; Maslennikov 1998:
42, 46, 72±89, 292±3).
Of course, the Bosporan landscape is not well represented by the black and white of
settlement distribution maps. For tification systems, trade routes, road networks,
burial mounds and land divisions all complicate the archaeological map produced
360 Susan E. Alcock, Jennifer E. Gates and Jane E. Rempel



by recent investigations. In addition, subtleties of settlement type and construction,
and of topographic location, are constituent par ts of any landscape. But for the
purposes of this brief case study, the changing settlement patterns of the four th and
third centur y B C ser ve as a metonym through which to illustrate the intimate links
between the landscape, the people that inhabited it, and the society in which they
functioned.
Presumably, an influx of population into the countr yside accompanied the founda
tion of the settlements themselves. This rural territor y thus became a more active and
crowded stage for interaction, contact and exchange, and the level of interaction
increased at the same time as it was being actively structured by the physical manifest
ations of Bosporan control. In this sense, these new rural settlements ser ved to
formalize interactions in the landscape within a frame of reference that was explicitly
linked with the hegemony of the cosmopolitan Bosporan state, and helped actively to
define that state as a distinct and separate entity. Pre-existing settlements, boundaries,
roads and burial mounds were also absorbed into this new Bosporan framework, and
their original meanings and resonances would have been altered, even subverted, by
this new context. For example, the earlier burial mounds, often set on hilltops and
along trade routes (Maslennikov 1998: 28; Paromov 1986: 72), and quite possibly
speaking of non-Greek control of the landscape, would, in the four th and third
centuries, have been `read' in conjunction with the proliferation of newly constructed
burial mounds commemorating the Bosporan elite. In other words, these former
statements of `steppe' presence and authority were overlaid with `Bosporan' implica
tions. In a similar way, the isolated hilltop farmsteads constructed in thepolis choras in
the sixth and fifth centuries ± potent statements of a Greek colonial presence in the
landscape ± would have now par ticipated in the larger statement of Bosporan control
in the context of other four th and third centur y settlements. The rural landscape of
the Bosporan kingdom in this period made a palpable statement about Bosporan
exclusion from the rest of the steppe.
This exclusion, however, should not be interpreted as that of Bosporan Greeks
versus the Barbarians of the steppe. Rather it was the consolidation of the Bosporan
kingdom, as both a physical and conceptual entity, that defined the exclusion. The
relatively fluid engagement with var ying cultural traditions that was visible in elite
self-presentation during this period meant that not only were cultural identifiers
polyvalent, but that this polyvalency was legitimated within Bosporan power struc
tures. The Bosporan kingdom had a culturally heterogeneous population, and while
people may have possessed Greek, Sindic, Maeotian or Scythian identities, separately
or in combination, they constructed those identities in a dialogue that acknowledged,
even incorporated, a mixed bag of cultural traditions. The vocabular y of this uniquely
Bosporan dialogue was at least conceptually accessible to ever yone who engaged in it,
and this accessibility made distinct statements about inclusion. These over tones of
inclusion must be read into the rural landscape as well. However much the network of
settlements, roads and for tifications represented, in a physical way, the Bosporan
state's control of the region, these constructions were also active par ticipants in the
dialogue, constantly being interpreted and af fecting interpretations in the process.
Settlements, roads, burials and boundaries all structured interactions with the land
scape, but were also constantly claimed through that interaction. In this way, the
obvious cultural specificities of a Greek-style farmstead or a Scythian burial mound
Reading the Landscape 361



were transcended by an overarching awareness of their individual roles and fluid
meanings in Bosporan society. Through this awareness, the rural landscape of the
Bosporan kingdom also spoke of inclusion for the people who inhabited it during this
period.
In the Bosporan kingdom, as in most par ts of the Hellenistic world, moving
beyond the Hellenocentric nature of our sources, discipline, training and proclivities,
in order to understand the complexities of multicultural interactions and transform
ations, is dif ficult ± to say the least. And yet such interactions flesh out our historical
and economic narratives by providing a social framework for human action. The
relative anonymity of landscape, and its ability to speak of change through time and
space, provide both a fresh perspective and a power ful investigative tool.
3 Landscape and Commerce in the Egyptian Eastern Desert
2
In their recent edited volume, Ashmore and Knapp asser t that no landscape study can
be objective, with the exception of `measurable economic impacts on a landscape'
(1999: 8). To be sure, Ashmore and Knapp are thinking here of questions such as
`how much agricultural land was irrigated by state-controlled canals?' or `what is the
average size of the production plot for a household practising subsistence farming?'
These `economic' questions are concerned with quantifying and understanding the
way in which a landscape was utilized, divided or perhaps marked in the process of
eking out a living in a physically brutal world. Yet in what way is this an `objective'
economic landscape? What do numbers and patterns mean without some sor t of
interpretive framework?
The ancient economy and, by default, the economic aspects of landscape, have
been under-studied because of the ver y nature of historical economic studies. The
contrast between the messy cultural aspects of society and the logical, rational features
of economy is a powerful paradigm. Although anthropologists have long pointed out
that economic actions are culturally determined, economy is still too often kept
largely separate from religious, social and political spheres of inquir y (Plattner
1989: 4). The assumption is that although the cultural aspects of ancient economies
may have in fact been dif ferent from our own, rational choice behaviours are still
quantifiable and analysis need not move beyond them. As a result, many researchers
interested in historical economic behaviours spend their time looking for scientific
ways to discuss the ancient economy. The raw data of economic discussions are
produced this way, but the next step is equally impor tant: the economy, like so
many other facets of ancient culture, is embedded in society and must be studied as
an aspect of social life, rather than as a separate and distinct entity (Gudeman 1986).
We must ask ourselves why cer tain economic choices `worked' for the persons making
them.
How do these questions intersect with the study of ancient landscapes? Other
aspects of society ± religious, political and social behaviours ± are routinely `read' in
the landscape. The manifestation of symbolic and cognitive systems, and their phys
ical correlates, are accepted as par t of the constructed and natural landscape. Eco
nomic action can also be seen in the landscape as par t of, and just as impor tant as,

other co-existing modes of behaviour which make up the warp and weft of social
fabric in antiquity. The study of a wholly `economic' landscape, therefore, is as
unrealistic as the study of a purely `sacred' landscape. These aspects exist simultan
eously.
The challenge becomes how to obser ve, in the landscape, the subtle interplay
between social and economic aspects of society. One possibility is to turn to new
research in material culture and economic studies. Consumption studies, for example,
of fer a fresh look at the relationship between economic behaviours and abstract
cultural discourses (Glennie 1996). The substance of such research is that economic
behaviours, specifically the complex act of consuming a commodity, are not subordin
ate to other social factors, but worked with and through them.
Like the consumption of a single object, the creation of landscape presents features
of all these social dynamics; it is shaped by actions and decisions which take into
account multiple reasons and complicated priorities. Thus the `economic' landscape is
a landscape shaped by demonstrably `economic' activities, but with implications for
much much more. In the Hellenistic period, this is a par ticularly impor tant point.
The Hellenistic economy is frequently described as if it were a single, unified system
with uniform practices and goals spread out across the whole of a Hellenized eastern
Mediterranean. Yet, as we have already noted, the sheer diversity of the physical world
covered under the umbrella of `the Hellenistic' demands that we look more critically
at regional economic practices.
As an example, we can turn to the Ptolemaic period trade system that connected
Berenike and the Nile cities of Edfu and Koptos (figure 21.3). This system was but a
single vein in the larger organism of the Ptolemaic economy, yet it provides us with an
oppor tunity to examine one par ticular `space' where economy and culture met. As is
well known, the geography of Egypt is extremely diverse. From the brilliant green of
the Nile Valley to the vast expanse of the Western Deser t and the rugged mountains
of the Eastern Deser t, its topographical features are as varied as the experiences they
suggest. It is not surprising that the sacred world of Egypt was closely identified with
the landscape and cer tain physical aspects of the land's form embodied ideas that were
at the centre of Egyptian religious thought (Richards 1999: 83±100).
The `sacred', however, is but a single layer of a more complex landscape (Alcock
1993: 6±7). Many concepts of place ± civic, political and economic ± are at work in
the geography of Egypt. At no time is this more true than in the later periods of
Egyptian histor y when foreign regimes dominated the countr y and the landscape was
af fected by large, regional powers: first the Hellenizing culture of the Ptolemies, and
later, the Mediterranean empire of Rome. Landscape, as an analytical tool, highlights
the ways in which these elements interact and how the experience of the physical
world, and of geography itself, were par t of Egypt's larger cultural environment.
The Eastern Deser t is a par ticularly fascinating example of just such a lived and
dynamic archaeological landscape. East of the Nile, between that river valley and the
Red Sea, it is bordered to the Nor th by the Delta and Sinai, and to the south by the
deser ts of Nubia in modern Sudan. This is an arid, deser t region, ver y mountainous
and dr y (figure 21.4). The mountain ranges are traversed by sandy wadis (dr y stream
beds), which direct the occasional seasonal flash flood. The wadis provided (and still
provide) a natural means of navigating through the mountains; ancient roads often, if
not always, used them as tracks. These ancient roads are an impor tant source of

information for the kinds of activity taking place in the region, and for relationships
between its population and the rugged world in which they lived.
The unique topography of the Eastern Desert makes field walking or other stand
ard methods of archaeological sur vey quite dif ficult! Rather than imposing any ver y
regular system of exploration upon the landscape, reconnaissance strategies must be
modified to accommodate the rocky and mountainous terrain. The wadis themselves
are navigable, but moving through the region is more complicated than it might first
appear. The sand is loose and vehicles often become stuck, so light transport, driven
by guides who are experienced `sand drivers', is a necessity (figure 21.4). Sur vey
usually takes place in the wadis, where ancient remains and ceramic scatters stand out
obviously on the sur face of the sand. The remarkable preser vation of the archaeo
logical remains in this dr y region also means that standing architecture is often visible,
allowing sites to be located on that basis as well.
Once a site is located, a GPS (ground positioning system) reading is normally
taken, any standing architectural features are recorded and a potter y sample drawn
and analysed. This information is used to create maps of artefact and site distribu
tions, which in turn help to identify the course of the ancient roadways. In some
cases, built-up areas and markers, as well as the occasional inscription, can be
obser ved along the line of the ancient route.

In short, the Eastern Desert roads were part of a system that moved goods from
sub-Saharan Africa and the Red Sea to the Nile, on which they were transported to
Alexandria, to be consumed there or in more distant parts of the Mediterranean
(figure 21.3). Gold, exotic animals, spices, beads, slaves and other commodities
were exchanged along these routes by merchants and traders. One of the primary
Ptolemaic port cities in the Eastern Desert region was Berenike on the Red Sea.
Around 275 B C , Ptolemy II Philadelphos founded this city, together with others
along that coastline, to facilitate trade with groups in the south and with Red Sea
merchants. The major routes through the desert connected Berenike to trans-ship
ment centres on the Nile. These river cities in turn acted as distribution centres that
oversaw the shipping of goods up the Nile towards the Mediterranean and the major
cities in the Delta. The two important Nile cities were Apollinopolis Magna (modern
Edfu) to the south and Koptos (modern Qift) to the north (figure 21.3; on this
network, see Maxfield 2001; Zitterkopf and Sidebotham 1989: 155±89; 1991: 571±

What can these roads tell us about the cultural and economic situation of Hellenis
tic Egypt? They hint at a complex and significant set of issues. For example, cultural
identity was very much a debated topic in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt. The language
you spoke, your name, your occupation, the objects with which you surrounded
yourself: all were immensely important in articulating a kind of fluid personal identity

which came into play as par t of daily life (Bowman 1986). Trade, of course, intro
duced new elements into this mix. New objects, representative of foreign places and
exotic experiences, broadened the immediate material surroundings of the mer
chants, traders, townsfolk and transporters who moved these goods through the
por t cities and along the Eastern Deser t roads.
Archaeological reconnaissance has made clear that these exotic commodities
(which are sometimes found at the por t city of Berenike) simply do not appear
at the deser t sites along the roads. Yet it is cer tain that such goods passed slowly
along the deser t routes before their arrival in Alexandria and in other Mediterranean
cities where they were destined for the homes of the wealthy or the storehouses of the
Ptolemaic monarchs (Bagnall et al. 2000). How would this task of transit, and the
objects at its centre, have been `understood' by the individuals who moved them
through the deser t? And how was it par t of a conception of their own social, cultural
and economic place ± as the movers and not the takers ± in the emergent new, multi
ethnic order of Ptolemaic Egypt?
The relationship between the landscape and the archaeological remains of the road
networks may suggest one way in which this problem was negotiated. Since we lack
any evidence that these desirable elite impor ts were ever diverted to the deser t way
stations along the roads (figure 21.5), the par ticipation of Egyptian traders cannot be
explained by simply assuming that they had hoped to acquire these goods and yet
366 Susan E. Alcock, Jennifer E. Gates and Jane E. Rempel



were unable to do so. If they had such hopes, some hint of emulation of what they
saw passing by, or some trace of their use of such goods, would surely appear in the
archaeological record. Their attitudes to these objects were likely much more com
plex, as was their conception of their own social and cultural situation. The non-elite
Egyptian groups involved in this trade were not just moving materials for a `foreign'
elite; they were interacting with the deser t in a way that was essential to their
understanding of their own role and identity in Ptolemaic society.
The degree of autonomy exercised by the traders and deser t dwellers ± the choice
of station and fort placement, the routes chosen through the deser t ± all these aspects
of the network were, in a sense, statements of their relationship with the landscape
and their asser tion of the literal `way' that this trade should take place. The harsh
deser t that they knew and navigated was a zone that demanded familiarity. Water and
resources, even in seasons of more abundance, would not have been common. The
ability to move through, and sur vive in, the convoluted wadis would itself have been a
precious commodity.
Thus, their familiarity with, and understanding of, the landscape was par t of the
cultural capital which these individuals brought to the Eastern Desert trade. Control
of the landscape may have been an asser tion of their own authority in the face of, and
± ironically ± in the ser vice of, a Hellenizing upper class that desired the commodities
they carried. In a sense, the landscape of the Eastern deser t and its par ticular
characteristics became a source of power; the archaeological remains stand as testi
mony to the close relationship between the Ptolemaic traders and the landscape they
travelled. Although the activities they pursued on these roads were in one sense
primarily `economic', an intrinsic par t of those actions was also eminently `cultural'.
Issues of power, identity and knowledge of a distinctly Egyptian landscape may have
been `cultural commodities' that were just as impor tant to the Eastern Deser t trade as
any measurable `economic impact' on the Hellenistic landscape.
4 The Divided Landscape of Crete
3
`A ver y uncomfor table place': such was the dr y verdict passed on Hellenistic Crete by
a twentieth-centur y student of the island (Bosanquet 1939±40: 72), and the reasons
for discomfort are not far to seek. During the Hellenistic period, the island remained
divided among numerous independent cities; although Hellenistic monarchs period
ically sought alliances with one or more of these poleis, royal policy encouraged
internal insular dissent (Davies 1984: 309). And dissent there was, for probably the
most salient feature of Hellenistic Crete (especially in the third and second centuries
B C ) was ongoing, often violent inter-city conflict and competition. Frequently this
took the form of one city expanding at the expense of other, usually smaller polities.
Successful communities included Gor tyn, Hierapytna, Kydonia, L yttos and Knossos;
the vanquished included Tylissos (by Knossos), Phaistos (by Gor tyn), Rhaukos (by
Gor tyn and Knossos), and Praisos and Istron (by Hierapytna) (figure 21.6). The
political organization of the island was thus radically altered, with a significant
reduction in the number of independent civic units. Some of these communities

may have sur vived their loss of independence, but others were clearly terminated
(Sanders 1982: 11±12).
Explaining this endemic strife has engaged commentators since Polybios in the
second centur y B C ± although to Polybios, such Cretan viciousness was no more than
he expected (see, for example, Polyb. 24.2.3). Scholars today instead point to the
trouble-making of external powers, and also propose more internal factors, such as a
likely rise in population and increasing inequality in land holding patterns (Chaniotis
1995). Whatever the causes behind the internecine friction, Crete emerges as a
restless, `uncomfortable' par t of the Hellenistic world.
How far can this restlessness be perceived in the island's landscape? And, more
impor tant perhaps, what can that landscape add to our understanding of the island
at this dif ficult time? The ability even to ask, let alone answer, such questions for
historic Crete is quite new. From the early work of Ar thur Evans around the turn
of the twentieth centur y, archaeological work on Crete focused almost exclusively on
the prehistoric period, the epoch of the Minoan palaces (S. Morris 1992: 173;
MacGillivray 2000). Today, however, a growing interest is manifest in `post-Minoan'
Crete, and that includes the work of numerous regional sur veys. In one recent count,
some twenty projects, from all par ts of Crete, could be named, although some remain
at an early stage of publication (Moody et al. 1998: 88). Two par ts of the island ± east
Crete and the Mesara plain ± are, however, suf ficiently well-explored to build up a
picture of Hellenistic developments in the countr yside. These are also areas especially
affected by the expansionist activities of, respectively, Hierapytna and Gor tyn.
In the east, we can concentrate on ancient Praisos, the ancestral home of the
Eteocretans (or `true' Cretans, reputedly the autochthonous inhabitants of the
island) until its destruction by Hierapytna around 145B C . Archaeological prospection
at this site extended over both the urban centre and its immediate rural hinterland.
Results of this work both reveal a thriving city in Classical and earlier Hellenistic times
and testify to its violent mid-second centur y B C end. Sur face sur vey here traces a sharp
disruption in local patterns of life, disruptions paralleled in other par ts of east Crete
thanks to the inter ventions of Hierapytna (for Praisos, Whitley et al. 1995; Whitley
1998; other projects: Hayden et al. 1992; Haggis 1996). Another regional sur vey,
368 Susan E. Alcock, Jennifer E. Gates and Jane E. Rempel



conducted in the high tablelands south-west of Praisos, may possibly suggest what
happened to at least some of that community's inhabitants. The Ziros Project noted
its first signs of permanent settlement in the Hellenistic period, a development
possibly reflecting the displacement and resettlement of the Praisos population
(Branigan 1998: 90).
The ver y real, and deep-running, impact of civic dissension can also be traced in the
fer tile Mesara plain, in the south-central par t of the island, and to the rise of Gor tyn
(later the Roman capital of the province of Crete and Cyrenaica). In the later
Hellenistic period, Gor tyn annexed the territories of several cities, of which Phaistos,
situated on the site of a Minoan palace, is most famous. Sur vey work, both extensive
and intensive, has emphasized marked rural change in the Mesara and beyond in
response to that development (Sanders 1976: 136±7; Watrous et al. 1993: 232±3;
Alcock 1994: 180). For example, settlement expanded dramatically in the vicinity of
one of Gor tyn's por ts (Matala), while in a remote valley to the south of the Mesara,
habitation seemed to `drift' nor th, towards Gor tyn and its surrounding plain
(Blackman and Branigan 1977: 75; Hope Simpson et al. 1995: 397±9). All in all,
regional sur vey ef fectively demonstrates that Hellenistic war fare, and the rewriting of
the island's political geography, resulted in significant ± if variable ± transformations
in the pattern of people's lives.
The study of landscape, as the preceding two case studies have made clear, can
reach beyond questions of settlement or economics; it can say much about human
response to changed conditions of life. Looking at other elements in the Cretan
landscape of fers one oppor tunity to gauge how people reacted to these disruptions,
or coped with anxiety about their uncer tain situation. One ver y clear reaction, for
example, is an investment in the past, in monuments and places perceived to be
ancient.
This phenomenon takes many forms. One manifestation is the appearance of
numerous small rural cults in Hellenistic times, many of which were located in
recognizably `old' settings (Sanders 1982: 39). The Mesara plain of fers several
good examples, par ticularly the area around Phaistos. Close to that community lay
the famous Minoan villa site of Ayia Triada. Excavation here recovered not only
impor tant prehistoric occupation, but signs of later cultic use (votives, fine potter y),
dating to the Iron Age and also to the Hellenistic period (D'Agata 1998). Nestled
close to a prehistoric tholos tomb in the Mesara ± Kamilari Tomb I ± lay a small shrine
to Demeter, of late Classical and Hellenistic date. Excavation and sur vey alike reveal
this juxtaposition of activity; the later finds included terracotta plaques, female
figurines and miniature horns of consecration (Alcock 1991: 459, n. 53; Cucuzza
1997: 72±4). An intensive sur vey of the western Mesara plain adds additional cases;
for example the discover y of Hellenistic potter y in close proximity to Late Minoan
tombs. Summing up the situation, that project's directors came to the conclusion:
`Minoan sites in the Mesara became the focus of cult during the Hellenistic period'
(Watrous et al. 1993: 231±2, quote at 231).
The well-explored Mesara plain may of fer the most instances of this `return to old
places', but they are to be found scattered elsewhere across the island. A Hellenistic
shrine was placed atop a Minoan countr y house at Pyrgos, on the south coast of the
island not far from Hierapytna (figure 21.7; Cadogan 1981: 169±71); Hellenistic
ceramics adorned the relieving triangle of a Late Minoan tholos tomb at Stylos
Reading the Landscape 369



Figure 21.7 View across the Minoan countr y house at Pyrgos, in which was later inserted a
Hellenistic shrine. Cour tesy of J. F. Cherr y
Sternaki to the west (Alcock 1991: 563, no. 12). Nor was this merely a matter of cult
activity at ancient monuments. Hellenistic settlements too overlay visible prehistoric
remains, for example at the palace site of Phaistos (Levi 1964: 11±12). Historic
episodes of ritual practices in Cretan caves ± often the site of prehistoric activity ±
were not new in Hellenistic times, but they definitely increased in number, leading
one student of the phenomenon to comment on an apparent `desire to visit ``old''
cult places . . . ' (Tyree 1974: 150; see also Rutkowski and Nowicki 1996; Watrous
1996). Finally, one could note cases where Hellenistic graves are placed within older
cemeteries or in association with older tombs: most remarkably at the well-excavated
Nor th Cemeter y at Knossos, where Hellenistic graves were inser ted ± carefully and
deliberately ± within the Iron Age cemeter y (Coldstream and Catling 1996).
What can be gained from this evidence for the ritual and commemorative land
scapes of Hellenistic Crete? Strong interest and investment in ancient places suggests
a deep concern with preser ving memories of the local past. In some cases, this seems
to have been over tly political and territorial in intent. It could be argued, for example,
that cult at Ayia Triada of fered one means for the community at Phaistos to maintain
control of that area (as has been said for its Iron Age practices: D'Agata 1998: 24).
Such an interpretation is suppor ted by the fact that the Ayia Triada cult ends around
the same time that Phaistos was swallowed up by Gor tyn, and thus lost any right to
claim its own territor y. Similar explanations may well account for other examples
reviewed here; in the uncer tain conditions of the Hellenistic age, the desire to make
such claims, and buttress them in many ways, would seem an understandable devel
370 Susan E. Alcock, Jennifer E. Gates and Jane E. Rempel



opment. As at Ayia Triada, some of these manifestations of interest in the local past
appear to end with the loss of civic autonomy; cer tainly almost all are abandoned with
the Roman conquest, when arguments over boundaries and independence became ±
to a great extent ± moot.
What we see in the Hellenistic landscape of Crete should not, however, be reduced
merely to matters of territor y and political authority. Claims to land were also claims
to identity and to a sense of belonging; the veneration of an old monument or
hallowed landmark was one way to combat the vulnerability felt by many Cretan
communities. If Cretans of the Hellenistic age faced the ver y real danger of displace
ment and dispossession (as the regional sur vey evidence suggests), they did not accept
this passively. We knew they waged war vigorously. What the evidence of landscape
reveals is that they resisted change and loss in other ways as well, by turning to the
past as a source of power, or of comfort.
5 Conclusion
This triad of brief case studies demonstrates the degree of regional variation at work
across the Hellenistic oikoumene. Yet each of the three treatments, in their dif ferent
ways, touches on common themes ± not least considering the impact of that world's
changing configuration, with its larger political units and greater velocity of contact;
they all share a sense of how conditions in one locale could well be influenced, even
dictated, by circumstances and events far away. Adopting a landscape perspective is
one positive way to explore this ongoing dialectic between the local and the global.
Another common element, of course, is a concern for evolving notions of identity and
ethnicity at this time, and how these concepts could be materially negotiated and
expressed. Such topics form, of course, the subject of much current scholarship on
the Hellenistic world.
What landscape archaeology can uniquely of fer is a new dimension to the study of
Hellenistic society. If cer tain elements ± the illiterate, the rural, the poor, the inhabit
ants of regions beyond the scope of our textual accounts ± had before been almost
automatically neglected, studies such as those offered here can now retrieve some
thing of their lives, their decisions, their attitudes. We return to where we began: our
understanding of the Hellenistic oikoumene is ver y much the product of the sources
we employ. The infusion of evidence from innumerable regional landscapes ± which is
only now beginning to be assimilated ± will leave that understanding both radically
altered, and much improved.

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Warfare
Patrick Baker
In the middle of the four th centur y, with the establishment of the Macedonian state
under Philip II and the reforms he made to the army, the Macedonian militar y
become the principal force to be reckoned with on the battlefields of the Greek
world. And when Alexander succeeded his father in 336, he lost no time in readying
his troops for war and launching his Asian conquests. Thus began a new era whose
political foundations were largely shaped by militar y phenomena. When I was asked
to write a chapter on war fare during the Hellenistic period, the editor of this volume
was especially interested in whether fundamental changes occurred with the advent of
the kings as dominant powers. Framed in this manner, this question points to a more
fundamental one, dealing with the Hellenistic period as a whole: Did it constitute a
break with ± or a continuation of ± the classical Greek world? The militar y histor y of
the Hellenistic period is primarily that of kingdoms and their armies. Over the
centuries, countless pages have been written on how these armies were commanded
and on the troops which filled their ranks. Much attention has also been paid to the
movement of armies; to how they were introduced to and supplied in dif ferent par ts
of the Greek world; to the tactics and strategies used in great battles, as described by
ancient historians; to the ethnic makeup of the troops; and so for th. As a result,
cer tain subjects have become tired and clichÂ ed.
Regardless of the specific theme which interests them, historians of the Hellenistic
period must always acknowledge the Greek heritage which stubbornly persists on the
Hellenistic landscape. Yet they must also recognize all of the new elements which,
taken together, ser ve to distinguish the period from previous ones, elements which
sometimes suggest a clean break with the archaic and classical worlds. The Hellenistic
period ± break with or continuation of the Greek world? Any attempt to provide a
definitive answer to this question would be mistaken. Things cer tainly changed,
sometimes substantially, but rarely is it possible to speak in terms of a clean break
with the classical period. Never theless, the changes were substantial enough to make
it dif ficult to simply speak in terms of continuity. Thus, the question remains: Did
war fare change during the Hellenistic period? The discussion which follows focuses
on one aspect of this question. Studying war fare naturally involves an interest in those



who actually par ticipated in war, and this is probably the area where changes were
most striking. But studying war fare during the Hellenistic period also requires that a
distinction be made between the war and those who took par t in it. This distinction
has a direct influence on the overall por trait of Hellenistic war fare painted below.
Hellenistic war fare can be approached from several dif ferent perspectives. The most
popular of these is innovation (or dif ference). Thus, Hellenistic militar y histor y
involves great armies suppor ted by equally impressive supply networks and increas
ingly sophisticated militar y machiner y. The troops of the period were more diverse
than the traditional hoplite phalanx, which had constituted the bulk of those militar y
forces drawn from the city-states of the old Greek world. From this perspective, war
was hencefor th a matter of militar y resources. The battlefield no longer seemed home
to citizen-soldiers, both because they were now far outnumbered by other troops and
because what was at stake in the conflicts went far beyond the local or regional
interests of city-states or federations of city-states. Likewise, ancient authors' accounts
of battles usually stress the multitude of soldiers present on the battlefield; the size of
the battlefield itself, which sometimes covered entire mountains and valleys; and the
thunderous clamour of troops fired up by their generals. (e.g. IMacc. 6.39±41; Plut.
Sull. 16).
For par t of my discussion, I will adopt a perspective which is less well represented in
the historiography. It focuses on city-states at war during the Hellenistic period. I will
show how, at this level, war fare had changed ver y little and how it is possible to speak
in terms of continuity with the archaic and classical worlds. In the process, I will of fer
some general reflections related to my recent research. These take the form of
questions regarding what needs to be understood about the place and the role of
Hellenistic city-states in a world where it seemed (and this idea is unfor tunately still
frequently promoted in modern historiography) that city-states no longer had a place,
drowned as they were in a sea of vast kingdoms which took responsibility for the most
impor tant aspects of international politics and whose vicissitudes, by themselves,
provided suf ficient inspiration to the historians and authors of antiquity. Thus,
these kingdoms have remained at the centre of the historical narrative. Of course,
not all works discussing the political histor y of the Hellenistic world neglect to
mention individual city-states when these played a role in an impor tant event.
However, with the exception of great cities like Rhodes, such passages tend to be
rare and anecdotal, while the larger narrative remains focused on the Hellenistic
kings, on their militar y campaigns and on their dynastic struggles with their kin.
This begs another set of questions which better orient the discussion which takes
shape below. What is the place (or the role) of Greek city-states in this world which
could, a priori, be described as new in comparison to the archaic and classical periods?
Is it even possible to speak in terms of city-states at war during the Hellenistic period?
1 War and Hellenistic Political History
A quick glance at Hellenistic society reveals a world of permanent war fare, with
conflicts occurring at various levels, and with the dif ferent levels often proving to
be linked together in practice. First of all, there were the wars between the Greco
Macedonian kingdoms created from the division of Alexander's empire. Large-scale
rivalries, these conflicts even took place between kingdoms which did not share
374 Patrick Baker



borders. Sometimes, individual kingdoms were torn apar t when, in ensuring their
succession to the throne, brothers and sisters were quick to take up arms. These
conflicts overshadow local rivalries between city-states, which had by no means been
pacified. Indeed, conflicts involving city-states continued as they had in previous
periods. Many of them would have been drawn into royal wars, and it is impossible
to know in detail the experiences of ever y individual city-state in the Aegean Basin.
Never theless, epigraphic documents ± which, thankfully, are abundant for this period
± leave no doubt as to the fact that previous antagonisms were still ver y strongly felt
and that recourse was being made to familiar tactics, be they war or diplomacy, to
resolve tensions.
Not only was war fare a permanent fixture on the Hellenistic landscape, but it can
also be seen as the founder of Hellenistic states, both through foreign conquests and
within the borders of existing kingdoms. The process began with Alexander's con
quest, a militar y expedition in which ever y inch of conquered territor y was won at the
point of a spear. It continued when the wars between Alexander's successors brought
about the fragmentation of his universal empire. Thus, the Hellenistic kingdoms
were, from the ver y beginning, militar y rivals. War was the primar y means of resolv
ing dif ferences, and the monarchs all followed a more or less imperialist strategy
(especially in third-centur y Egypt) by fighting amongst themselves for territories like
Koile-Syria or the islands in the Aegean Sea, by making alliances against one another
and even by taking their penchant for conquest abroad. For example, in Italy, Pyrrhos
organized an alliance of Greek city-states against Rome and Carthage between 280
and 275 (Bengtson 1975: 98±100). Similarly, in India, the Seleukid kingdom never
fully succeeded in securing the allegiance of the Baktrian satraps. As for the creation
of new states within existing kingdoms, the Seleukid kingdom in Asia constitutes a
par ticularly striking example. Fed by the mutual animosities of the numerous tribes
united under royal authority, war raged uninterrupted. By the third centur y, the
territor y originally ceded to Seleukos I had fragmented into numerous smaller states,
and Antiochos III, the dynasty's fifth monarch, had to re-conquer the territor y of his
forefathers. The example of the Seleukids clearly shows how the Hellenistic kings, as
sovereigns of lands conquered by force of arms, were never at peace, not even at
home. The Ptolemies paid dearly for giving the Egyptians the oppor tunity to liberate
themselves when the latter were integrated into Ptolemaic contingents for the battle
of Raphia in 217 (Will 1982: 40±4). Thus, Hellenistic war fare both established and
erased frontiers (Austin 1986: 454±7).
During the Hellenistic period, war also laid the foundations of royal power and
authority. Such power was not completely new; Greek city-states had been con
fronted with this type of government since the Macedonian expansion of the four th
centur y. Now, however, it represented the primar y form of state authority in all
territories touched by Hellenistic civilization, and this was the case for the entire
length of the Hellenistic period. Alexander and his successors became kings by vir tue
of the `law of the sword'. Kings were above all generals, generalissimos. Their dress
was that of the Macedonian soldier, including the sandals, the chlamys, and the hat.
They led their troops to combat (ten of the fourteen Seleukid monarchs died in
battle) and their victories were celebrated in hymn, in honorific epithets (Great,
Poliorketes, Saviour, Kallinikos), and in the numerous sources recording their mili
tar y accomplishments (including stone inscriptions, papyri, Nike-type coins specially
Warfare 375



issued following a victor y, statues and trophies). Battlefield victories were a key
element of royal cults. A kind of royal mystique, coupled with a theology of victor y,
was developed during the Hellenistic period, when the king came to be associated
with the goddess Nike, Victor y personified. For example, the reaction of the inhabit
ants of Koile-Syria to Ptolemy's victor y at Raphia (Polyb. 5.86) can be summed up by
quoting an inscription describing Ptolemy in the days following the battle: King
Ptolemy Great God Saviour, Philopator and Nikephoros (
OGIS
89). The monarchs
themselves were conscious of the impor tance accorded to militar y victor y in legitim
izing their power over the people, and the ar t of war rapidly became a science studied
by numerous kings and militar y leaders. It was believed that a good king, like a good
general, had to combine within his person audacity, clear-sightedness, and self
control (Plut.
Pyrrh
. 8;
Phil
. 4; L Â eve Ã que 1968: 276±9; Austin 1986: 457±9).
Finally, is it really necessar y to point out that war was a source of profit? Even if the
objectives in expanding a kingdom's borders were primarily political or strategic, the
spoils of victor y ser ved both to satisfy the troops in the field and to fill the royal
treasur y, insofar as newly-conquered peoples were added to the tax rolls and, in
cer tain cases, to the lists of those required to pay tribute. More specifically, the
conquest of por ts in the Aegean Islands or along the coasts of Greece and Asia
Minor meant that a Hellenistic king could open up his kingdom to the resources of
Arabia, Upper Egypt and the Red Sea, not to mention the forests of Koile-Syria (a
ver y precious commodity when it came to naval constr uction). Thus, war of fered the
means for achieving greatness while it stimulated the economy by increasing the
demand for and the circulation of goods and currency (Austin 1986: 459±61). For
example, the widespread use of mercenaries, which was also an impor tant source of
cultural exchange during the Hellenistic period, constituted one of the impor tant
vectors of economic and commercial vitality whose ef fects can be seen today in
archaeological digs which document the widespread circulation of goods and cur
rency.
During the Hellenistic period, the four th-centur y hegemonic ideal of cer tain great
classical cities like Athens, Thebes and Spar ta was inherited by the Greco-Macedonian
kingdoms whose reach was infinitely more vast. In this new context, city-states would
have naturally held a smaller, more limited place. And it is tempting to assume that
since city-states no longer carried the same weight, they did not have a significant role
to play in the histor y of the period, one which began with all of the city-states being
subjugated to larger kingdoms, a form of power they had been aware of but which
had supposedly been absent from the Greek political landscape up to that point. Yet it
can easily be shown that this state of subjugation was by no means new. Any disrup
tion caused by the conquest of Greece by Philip II, and later by Alexander's cam
paign, had relatively little ef fect on the Greek city-states beyond the multiplication of
their numbers (Gauthier 1984; Ma 2000a: 107). Thus, the traditional model of
democratic government ± which gave the people control over political life, over
justice and over community administration ± persisted in a new, though not neces
sarily inferior, form. This phenomenon was most striking in the Greek city-states of
Western Asia Minor which had endured centuries of Persian domination. Their
political framework, by contrast with that of the city-states of Greece itself, did not
result from a long evolution, nor did it rely on a well-established tradition. After
being declared free by Alexander the Great, many of them entered a significant phase

of political, economic and cultural development. As for the city-states within Greece
itself, on the Aegean islands and in the Peloponnese, both the Athenian imperialism
and the political context of the four th centur y had, long before the Hellenistic
period, made them familiar with a state of international politics where ideological,
political and militar y stakes regularly went far beyond their local interests.
For city-states of all kinds, written documents from the period attest to an impor t
ant increase in the number of diplomatic contacts, to the founding of impor tant
religious festivals, and to the diversity and prosperity of commercial activity, notwith
standing occasional periods of uncer tainty related to the vicissitudes of international
politics. Meanwhile, archaeological finds show how their prosperity was reflected in
the construction of great panhellenic sanctuaries, or of monumental for tified walls
still visible to this day. Thus, contrar y to a once widespread opinion whose adherents
are becoming progressively fewer in number, the Hellenistic period was not one of
decline for Greek city-states. Rather, it represented the height of their development.
Granted, despite successive declarations by Alexander and the Diadochoi making
them independent, some of them lost no time in falling back into a state of subjuga
tion. Ephesos provides a good example. With the exception of a few brief periods of
independence, it remained a royal capital ruled by a governor with a permanent
garrison at his disposal from 334 B C until the Roman Conquest. Samos did not
obtain independence from the Ptolemaic kingdom until about 192 B C . The begin
ning of the second centur y is also the period when epigraphic documents related to
that city's af fairs first appeared and proliferated. But Ephesos and Samos are two
exceptions which should not distract from the experience of hundreds of other cities
which, in many cases, have left an extensive written record.
2 Means of War
Diversified troops
The militar y resources of the great kingdoms have proved a subject of utmost interest
to both the authors of antiquity and modern scholars. Like Alexander's army, the
troops of the Greco-Macedonian armies were both numerous and cosmopolitan.
When he began his conquest, Alexander had an army of between 40,000 and
50,000 men, the core of which was made up of Macedonians, both infantr ymen
and horsemen, who fought alongside a number of specialist contingents, manned by
Greek allies or mercenaries: Greek infantr y and cavalr y, Cretan archers and slingers,
Thracian or Balkan light infantr y and cavalr y, etc. Over time, Alexander's army
became increasingly diversified, although it maintained a hierarchy largely based on
ethnic criteria: Macedonian and Greek heavy infantr y; Persian or Cretan archers and
spearmen; horsemen of diverse origins; Greek engineers charged with building or
maintaining siege machines and ar tiller y and with digging mines; and so on. The
famous divisions of Asian elephants were soon added to the mix, and later became
par ticularly common in the Seleukid armies. Finally, to round out the forces, a
number of interpreters and tradesmen were required (D. Engels 1978: 11±26;
Rochette 1997). When the army reached India, it included some 120,000 men,
although this number was reduced to 80,000 by the time of Alexander's death.
And while the army's ranks were continually replenished by the ver y tribes it
Warfare 377



subjugated along its route, Greeks were established in the militar y colonies to ser ve as
occupying armies. It was the members of this latter group which quickly began
organizing themselves into genuine Greek city-states.
Like Alexander's `founding' army, those of his successors were composed of
troops which were both cosmopolitan and great in numbers. After all, Ptolemy II
Philadelphos could rely on a force of 240,000 men (App. Preface 10), though the
figure was greatly reduced under the reign of Philopator, whose forces numbered
only 75,000 men (Polyb. 5.65). While statistical data gleaned from the authors of
antiquity must always be viewed with a critical eye, they never theless provide rough
estimates which can be used for the purposes of parallel and comparison. Thus, in
217, Antiochos III mobilized almost 62,000 infantr ymen and 6000 horsemen
against his Ptolemaic enemies. These numbers are similar to those he is repor ted to
have commanded at the battle of Magnesia in 189: 60,000 infantr ymen and 12,000
horsemen (Polyb. 5.79; Livy 37.18).
Most soldiers were mercenaries, and demand for their ser vices was great. During
the third centur y, Macedonians and Greeks answered the call in great numbers by
visiting recruitment centres established across the eastern Mediterranean. Material
conditions (pay, etc.) were relatively good, since the new kingdoms created following
the division of Alexander's empire were at the height of their power. Texts never the
less describe problems with recruitment and pay which constantly faced monarchs
and militar y leaders. Take, for example, the contract made between Eumenes of
Pergamon and his soldiers on the subject of pay (OGIS 266, trans. Austin 196;
Launey 1950: 742±3; Virgilio 1982), the one entered into by the Karian dynast
Eupolemos with the defenders of Theangela, whom he had just conquered (Robert
1936: 78±9), or the dif ficulties the Ionian city-state of Er ythrai had in providing for
the pay of its mercenaries (I.Er ythrai 24). In the second and first centuries, material
conditions deteriorated and recruiters increasingly sought out barbarians: Semites,
Jews, Asians. Indigenous contingents were also recruited in Egypt and Asia, while the
Macedonian army conser ved a more national character (Grif fith 1935: 308±16).
Over the course of three centuries, Ptolemies, Seleukids and Attalids succeeded in
standardizing the recruitment of troops. They did so in such a way as to ensure both a
regular supply and an equal presence across the entire territor y occupied by their
respective kingdoms. In Egypt, a system of kleruchia (kle Ãrouchia) was established: in
exchange for a parcel of land to be developed (whose size varied according to the
recipient's rank), the kleruch (kle Ãrouchos) could be mobilized (with payment) and
taxed. Though originally based on a form of individual tenure where the occupant's
rights were limited to usufruct, the kleruchia was gradually transformed into heredi
tar y and alienable property. Thus, the kleruch could cede his property to his sons by
gift or inheritance, or sell it to a third par ty, just as well as he could lose it for having
badly managed it (e.g. Sijpesteijn 1979: 151±8). This was an individual and essentially
rural system, where the sons of kleruchs became kleruchs in turn, giving the Ptolem
aic forces the appearance of a permanently garrisoned army across the territor y. The
Seleukids and the Attalids preferred to establish permanent rural or urban settlements
responsible for their own defence and, eventually, for regular militar y ser vice in the
royal army. These settlements sometimes took the form of city-states, more often of
militar y colonies (G. Cohen 1991: 41±50). By contrast to the Ptolemaic kleruchic
system, this collective system attracted immigrants to settlements which were in
378 Patrick Baker



keeping with their traditions, sometimes forcing the neighboring Greek city-states to
trade with their new neighbours (e.g. OGIS 229, Austin 182).
Given their large numbers, mercenaries were conspicuous figures in Hellenistic
society. Leading no real civic life, they could never theless vote decrees and exercise
political influence on their employers. Their influence was mainly a cultural one, with
the spread of their gymnasia, cults and Greek lifestyles continuing at least until the
third centur y. Subsequently, their influence was felt to a lesser extent. Although
writers seldom por trayed them in a favourable light, and they were often an object
of derision in the literature of the period (Polyb. 6.52; 15.25; or the mercenaries in
the comedies of Menander: Thrasonides in Misoumenos, Polemon in Perikeiromene
and Stratophanes in Sykionios), their superiority to the citizen-soldier was nevertheless
widely recognized (Diod. 29.6).
Diversified tactics
The distinctiveness of the great kingdoms' militar y resources is usually most striking
from a technical perspective. First of all, the diversity of troops constituted a clean
break with what had been known in the classical Greek city-states, despite the fact that
mercenaries had been increasingly used since the four th centur y. The phalanx
remained the hear t of the army, the Macedonian version proving even heavier and
more monolithic than its Greek counterpar t, making it a wonder of the Hellenistic
world. The technical specifications of the phalangite's equipment changed ver y little.
He wore a coat of mail (which protected him better than the simple breastplates worn
by Greek heavy hoplite infantr y) and a helmet, while he carried a shield and a straight
sword. Nevertheless, the Macedonian sarissa replaced the Greek pike which had been
shor ter (2.5 m) and, as a result, less ef fective. Measuring between 5 and 6 metres, the
sarissa had to be held with two hands, thereby hindering the movement of the
phalanx. Not that increased mobility was necessar y, as the phalanx could simply lie
in wait for an enemy charge. In fact, the sarissa had a sharp point at both ends,
allowing it to be stuck in the ground, thereby creating an almost impenetrable wall of
spikes (Markle 1977; 1978; 1982).
From a tactical perspective, land combat appears to have evolved ver y little, in spite
of the introduction of many new categories of troops and specialized contingents.
Although Alexander and Pyrrhos proved themselves to be brilliant tacticians, most
battles were still decided by the clash of two phalanxes, accompanied by smaller
skirmishes, with the elite troops being concentrated in the right wing. Yet Alexander's
conquest included only four engagements ± the battles of Granikos (334), Issos
(333), Gaugamela (331), and the River Hydaspes (326) ± fought in the same manner
as those which had occurred in previous centuries. Across the entire period, while
battles were fought with the idea of two compact masses in mind, they also took
forms which reflected the armies' increasingly diverse troops. In the middle of the
period, the clash of the Macedonian phalanx and the Roman legion was the source
of great surprise and bitter defeat. The ultimate tool of war in the Greek world
for almost six centuries had found a superior enemy. By far the best account of
the struggle (notwithstanding the author's obvious bias) comes from Polybios, who
tells the tragic stor y of the crushing of Philip V by Flamininus at Kynoskephalai
(18.29±32; also Livy 31.34).
Warfare 379



Hellenistic armies' light troops were numerous and diverse, thanks to the recruit
ment of barbarians and semi-barbarians (the latter categor y refers to barbarians from
the border regions of the Greek world who used a combination of armament and
tactics). As technicians of war fare, capable of managing both technical and cultural
diversity, the Greeks were often sought after to prepare and even command troops. As
I mentioned before, so-called `light' troops varied significantly from one army to the
next ± both internally in terms of ethnicity and across time ± making it impossible to
provide a detailed description here. I will merely underscore the fact that although the
cavalr y was frequently used by Alexander ± he made it his primar y assault force, going
so far as to charge enemy infantr y on the flanks and from the back ± it proved to be a
less popular weapon in subsequent periods, when it was used mainly as a light
contingent for skirmishes, harassing enemy troops during their movements (Brunt
1963; Hammond 1978). But although the connection between phalanx and cavalr y
became much less impor tant after Alexander, it should be noted that this coincided
with the emergence of squadrons with well established reputations, such as the
Tarentine mounted spearmen (Grif fith 1935: 246±50; Launey 1949: 601±4).
Despite their lack of ef ficiency, one of the most commonly evoked elements of
Hellenistic armies was their dreadful scythed chariots, copied from the Persians (war
chariots had not been used by the Greeks since the so-called Dark Ages). They were
first described by Xenophon, who wrote of their invention by Cyrus (Cyr. 6.1). They
subsequently appeared in the armies of Antiochos III, in 189; of Mithradates, in 86;
and of Pharnakes II, son of Mithradates, in 47 (Glover 1950). Another interesting
(and substantial) component of Hellenistic royal armies were Indian elephants, soon
followed by their African counterpar ts; the latter variety proved less docile and
consequently less useful. Occasionally, these animals were a decisive element for the
success of an army in the field. Seleukos I apparently gathered almost 480 of them at
the battle of Ipsos in 301. They were a gift of Seleukos' new ally, the Maur yan king of
India, Chandragupta (Sher win-White and Kuhr t 1993: 12). Antiochos III fielded
102 at Raphia, where his opponent, Ptolemy IV, had 73 (Polyb. 5.79). However,
despite the novel and spectacular nature of these living weapons, they were far from
ideal, since they could easily turn against those who used them and consequently
required special precautions (Polyaen. 4.6.3). Elephants vir tually disappeared from
Greek battlefields after the defeat of Antiochos III at Magnesia in 189 (Scullard 1974:
180±5).
In the distinctively Greek tradition of naval war fare, exemplified by Athens and the
Delian League, maritime forces came to play a critical role in the wars between
Hellenistic kingdoms. After all, if the Eastern World had traditionally seen the
Mediterranean as little more than another in a long list of natural boundaries, it
remained the centre of the world for the Hellenistic dynasties. Consequently, it was
the site of innumerable naval battles and focus of a veritable `arms race', both in terms
of the number of vessels built (150 to 200 units for Ptolemy I; 500 for Demetrios
Poliorketes; 200 for Pyrrhos in Sicily) and in terms of their size (twenty, thir ty and
even for ty-bank ships!). Triremes never theless remained the vessel of choice, with
pentereis and even heptereis also proving particularly common. Although the Macedo
nians were never great mariners, Ptolemies and Seleukids fought over the forests of
Koile-Syria, which were essential for naval construction. And throughout the third
centur y, the Ptolemies controlled the Aegean Basin and Straits, a power ful maritime
380 Patrick Baker



position which subsequently passed for a time to the great city of Rhodes, which
acted as a veritable maritime policeman (Ormerod 1924: 128±50; Ber thold 1984:
98±101; Gabrielsen 1997: 42±4). In any case, the size and the weight of the fleets
meant that there could be nothing subtle about maritime battles, which most often
took the form of clashes between two lines of ships. That much is known from the
descriptions of battles given in the sources. Naturally, there might also have been
smaller skirmishes at sea, notably with pirates, which would have more closely
resembled the naval battles of the classical era (e.g. SIG 3 567; Baker 1991: 24±30).
The poliorketika ± literally the science of siege war fare ± reached its height by the
end of the four th and into the third centur y, by which time vir tually all cities had been
for tified. The remnants of these fortifications bear witness to elaborate plans and to
the application of a continually improved know-how. These coveted assets integrated
such elements as trenches, for ward-walls, towers, cre Âmaille Áres and sawtooth layouts,
and postern-gates (McNicoll 1997). Throughout the period, siege machines, to
gether with the mobility of light troops, were comparable to those developed during
the four th centur y, especially by one of the Diadochoi, famous for his ability to win
over besieged cities, Demetrios son of Antigonos justly named Poliorketes, the
Besieger: these included rolling towers, battering rams, ar tiller y, etc. (Garlan 1974;
1984).
3 Warfare and City-States
Civic armies and means of war
There are several sources available to the modern historian for appreciating the
militar y resources of Hellenistic city-states. The most obvious of these are the still
visible for tifications that surrounded vir tually ever y city, which naturally have great
archaeological significance and provide impor tant technical and tactical insights.
However, these for tifications also bear witness to the complex work of militar y
organization and planning overseen by civic bodies, the details of which can be
found in various texts. For example, the construction and maintenance of walls are
documented in agreements reached between city-states and their contractors, as well
as in administrative documents honouring the citizens responsible for this work: for
example the epistates of the rampar ts, epistates teichon were usually organized into a
college, as they were at Er ythrai (I.Er ythrai 23). Meanwhile, shor t texts from Smyrna
and Stratonikeia clearly show how the layout of that par t of the city lying within the
walls was also the object of planning by civic bodies, with an eye to essentially militar y
concerns (I.Smyrna II.1.613a±c; I.Stratonikeia II.1.1003±4; Varinlioglu 1994: 189±
91). Fur thermore, information on the financing of fortification projects can be
found in subscriptions raised for that purpose, notably those voted by the people of
Kolophon at the ver y end of the four th centur y (Migeotte 1992: 214±23). Finally,
for tifications were also built to protect a city's outlying territor y, and the more
modest ruins of various small for ts and for tresses are still visible to those who choose
to stray from the beaten path (on the costs of fortifications and their manning, Baker
2000).
But while the mere existence of these for tifications is notewor thy, the individuals
who manned them are even more significant. Texts describe the quar tering of
War fare 381



citizen-soldiers in the small forts around the city's territor y or in the citadel. Clearly,
these men did not hesitate to take up arms in defence of the interests of their
community. Fur thermore, numerous militar y of fices were filled by citizens, following
democratic elections. And in the vast majority of Hellenistic city-states, ef forts were
made to educate future citizens in the ar ts of war. I use the plural deliberately, for to a
great extent the city-states kept up with the technical advances of their time. Thus,
while youth still studied the traditional tactics of hoplite war fare, they also received
instruction in archer y, firing catapults and combat in light arms. These examples are
taken from the numerous inscriptions found in gymnasia, principally lists of cham
pions (Gauthier 1997).
Clearly, evidence of Hellenistic city-states' militar y resources is not lacking. And yet
this evidence has long remained largely ignored, perhaps because of the diverse nature
of the sources. No single text provides a clear understanding of the actual situation in
a given city. But by assembling all of the available evidence, it is never theless possible
to sketch an overall view by drawing on the experiences of cer tain cities as recorded in
inscriptions (for example, see the study of militar y expenses in the cities by Migeotte
2000). Thus, the impossibility of knowing the details surrounding each individual
city-state's civic militia is no longer an excuse for raising doubts regarding the ver y
existence of those institutions.
City-states at war
Determining the militar y means at the disposal of Hellenistic city-states only par tially
addresses the question of their defence. From a more pragmatic perspective, it
remains to be seen exactly whom they had to defend themselves against and what
concrete dangers they actually faced. The first element which set the Hellenistic
period apar t was a new form of political power, essentially founded on the might of
astonishingly large armies. As a result, city-states also had to come to terms with a
new form of war, or rather new reasons for making war. Integrated into great
kingdoms which were being made and remade all around them ± sometimes to
their advantage, sometimes at their expense ± city-states were required to operate a
two-fold foreign policy. On the one hand, they actively fought to maintain their
political autonomy, although autonomy and liberty were occasionally marred by
compromises which brought alternating periods of democracy and oligarchy or, in
earlier periods (i.e. under Alexander's successors), occasional subjugation to the
authority of a tyrant. On the other hand, city-states pursued a `traditional', smaller
scale, foreign policy based on shifting alliances and conflicts with neighbouring city
states. These territorial squabbles, settled by arms or by negotiation, may have been
essentially local in nature, but they were no less impor tant for the city-states involved.
The attitude of Hellenistic city-states to this complex political landscape bears witness
to their desire to maintain their independence from any and all foreign powers.
This political landscape represented various kinds of threats to city-states, and
naturally elicited various kinds of militar y and political reactions. In the case of hostile
royal armies, responses could range from simply accepting the subjection of the city
state to obstinacy and a desire to make a stand. The latter option brought about
armed conflicts whose outcomes were rarely favourable to the city-states (there are
numerous examples, e.g. Phokaia and Teos in 190 B C : Polyb. 21.6.1±6; Livy
382 Patrick Baker



37.11.15; 27.9; 28.1±2; 32.1±8). In these conflicts with Hellenistic kingdoms, city
states were primarily concerned with preser ving their liber ty and autonomy. Mean
while, the royal attacker was normally interested in a city for the strategic impor tance
of such features as its urban centre or its por t, which could ser ve as strategic posts
within a much larger territor y. This helps explain why such conflicts usually took the
form of a siege of a city rather than an open war on its territor y. From another
perspective, several factors might have led a royal army to linger on a city's territor y.
Perhaps it had been unable to subjugate the city's besieged population and was
seeking vengeance on the hinterland. Or perhaps the attacker was tr ying to draw
the defending troops out of the city. A final explanation would apply to cases where
the king had no real interest in the city itself. Rather, he was simply taking advantage
of its territor y's resources to supply his troops. From yet another perspective, city
states did not hesitate to attack their counterpar ts. And when the enemy was another
city-state, conflicts rarely centred on the siege of a city. Instead, they focused on
extracting the hinterland's economic and material resources. However, it is dif ficult
to know whether these conflicts mirrored the agonistic battles of earlier times or
whether they reflected the evolution begun in the fourth centur y by becoming more
drawn out af fairs involving wars of attrition and raids.
In any case, the defence of city and hinterland alike was tirelessly maintained.
Diplomatic contacts with neighbouring cities were increased and militar y alliances
or assistance agreements were increasingly common in the course of relations between
city-states. Kings or their representatives were also the object of diplomatic over tures
on the par t of plenipotentiar y representatives sent by city-states concerned with the
security of their national territories and of their inhabitants. For most city-states, the
armies they maintained were primarily charged with defending the civic space (sig
nificant examples can be found in epigraphic documents: Miletos and Herakleia
under Latmos made an alliance, SIG
3 633; Priene organized against the Gauls,
OGIS 765; other measures taken against the Gauls at Er ythrai, I.Er ythrai 28; etc.).
This fact brings to mind the famous document describing the emergency measures
taken by the Ephesians during one of the Mithradatic wars, in December 87 and
Januar y 86 B C : `as great dangers threaten the sanctuar y of Ar temis, the city and all of
its citizens, along with all of the inhabitants of the city and its territor y, it is necessar y
that all show solidarity in facing this period; may it please the people, the af fair
per taining to the defence, security and safety of the sanctuar y of Ar temis, of the
city and its territor y . . .' (OGIS 742.23±8).
This naturally leads to new questions regarding the nature of these localized
conflicts. What were these minor clashes which were par t of the ordinar y course of
life for Greek city-states and which are frequently mentioned in the epigraphic
sources? Are we to see here war fare as a means of settling border disputes, as the
prelude to peace treaties, as the result of shifting militar y alliances? Though relatively
less intense and requiring fewer resources, these conflicts remained ver y serious from
the perspective of the city-states themselves, since they dealt directly with the integrity
of the civic space.
A series of documents traces the relations between the city-states in the lower
Maeander valley for a period of about 75 years, covering the latter par t of the third
centur y and first half of the second centur y. Although it often deals with isolated and
seemingly unrelated incidents, this rich epigraphic dossier describes numerous border

During the years 184±180
BC
a pea ce trea ty was nego tiated bet ween the citi es of
Miletos and Magnes ia-on-th e-Maeande r and the respect ive allies, Herakl eia under
Latmos a nd Priene . The trea ty brought an end to a war about whi ch lit tle is know n,

relate to the ownership of a ter ritor y disputed by the two city-states ( SIG 3
5 88, trans.
Burstein 37; Age r 1996: 292±6). The ter ritor y , known as Per aia, prob ably consti

for several decade s. Inde ed, a common thre ad is woven throug h both the docum ents
related to those co nflicts and the trea ty sign ed b etween Milet os and Mag nesia. The
war betwe en these two city -states was caused by conflicting claims to ar able lands
situate d in the valley at the edg es o f their respect ive ter ritori es. Fight ing had previ
ously er upted over the ownership of these lands between Priene and Magnesia (SIG3
679; Ager 1996: 321±7), Priene and Miletos ( I.Priene 26, 27, 28; Ager 1996: 271±
3), and later Miletos and Herakleia under Latmos ( SIG 3
633; Ager 1996: 290±2). As
early as the last third of the third centur y , the intro duction o f Cret an soldie r-colonist s

settlers when the ter ritor y passe d into the ha nds of the Magne sians, following the

384 Patrick Baker



1950: 815±35). On this subject, I will limit myself to a single example. Several
epigraphic documents allow for a relatively detailed analysis of how the islands of
Kos and Kalymna organized the defence of their territor y between 205 and 200.
Their ef for ts consisted of public subscriptions calling for a general ef for t on the par t
of the population, as well as decrees in honour of par ticularly devoted citizens (
SIG
3
567, 569; Habicht and Hallof 1998: 116±21). Yet the two successive conflicts which
these islands par ticipated in had implications which went beyond merely local con
cerns. The first, called the `Cretan War' because of the par ticipation of several Cretan
city-states, was instigated by the Macedonian king, Philip V. The second involved the
Macedonian fleet itself. The course of events is well known, thanks especially to
Polybios, and the sources leave no doubt as to the fact that Kos and Kalymna, then
allies of the mighty city of Rhodes, were cast as actors, extras and victims in a drama
whose plot extended far beyond their own borders. Never theless, the civic spirit, still
ver y much alive, allowed them to ef ficiently organize the defence of the national
territor y of the two islands (Baker 1991).
4 Peace
In a world of incessant wars, the idea of peace retained the positive connotations it
had begun to take on during the four th centur y. In principle, the treaties negotiated
during the period were permanent, although their clauses sometimes included provi
sions for changes or renewals. These treaties presented peace `as a state which must be
restored, conser ved, renewed, confirmed' (PrÂ eaux 1961: 234). That being said, the
kings played a paradoxical role in the concer t of international relations. Not simply
warriors, they were also responsible for restoring and conser ving order, especially
from the perspective of their subjects and that of the city-states under their authority,
by whom they were often heralded as saviours, protectors and benefactors. Even
Alexander presented himself as the world's conciliator and peacemaker, despite the
fact that his mission was essentially one of militar y conquest. Thus, the king em
bodied the `peace of the magnanimous victor y' (PrÂ e aux 1961: 233). And while the
exploits of princes were the subject of of ficial praise, many decrees also praised the
work of peacemakers, diplomats and ambassadors. As the kings rarely under took the
work of negotiation themselves, these individuals were normally extremely impor t
ant, recognized for their great abilities and eloquence.
This situation inexorably points to a more br utal reality: clearly, when they sought
peace, kings usually had militar y considerations in mind. Often finding themselves in
a state of temporar y weakness following a less-than-successful militar y campaign, they
saw peace as an oppor tunity to buy time or to seek out a weaker adversar y. In other
words, war was ever-present in the kings' minds while peace was merely a means of
freeing up resources and `regrouping'. Thus, the political balance was always precar
ious and continually put into question. The kings' preferred way of making peace was
by following traditional procedures, thereby limiting the degree of innovation and
retaining the idea of peace as a contract. However, negotiations often proved dif ficult
and the terms imposed were not always fully accepted by one par ty or the other,
resulting in ongoing tensions and leading to new conflicts (e.g. Koile-Syria, that
eternal bone of contention between the Ptolemies and the Seleukids). Fur thermore,
there was no organization standing above the kingdoms, in a position to act as referee

385



or as guarantor of the treaties. With few exceptions, from the middle of the second
centur y until the end of the period, even the Roman Senate only inter vened as a par ty
to the conflicts, and not as a superior power. Thus, while Roman militar y power
gradually overcame that of the Hellenistic kingdoms, Rome's dominance was felt as a
militar y adversar y, and not as a referee.
Meanwhile, relations between city-states proved both constant and intense, even if
they were often carried on under the shadow of the great powers. The latter were
sometimes called on for help, which explains why local quarrels of limited scope are
sometimes mentioned in general treaties which put an end to vast wars between great
powers. On top of all this there was piracy as well as the social conflicts taking place
within individual city-states. Thus, relations between Greeks had changed ver y little.
In many cases, evidence of conflicts comes from attempts to resolve dif ferences.
Arbitration, an ancient form of conflict resolution, continued to be practised during
the Hellenistic period, as numerous epigraphic documents attest. However, this
abundance of documentation does not necessarily mean that it had become an
increasingly popular or ef fective tool for securing peace. The initiative for negoti
ations often came from outside: a king (at least at the beginning of the period), a
confederation, a neutral city-state, or the Senate after 200 B C . But warring city-states
could also take the initiative and request that an external neutral power inter vene as
arbitrator, be it a city-state (or city-states), a king, a confederation, or the Senate. The
procedures remained the same as in earlier times, although the agreements reached
were fragile and often put into question, for want of institutions capable of imposing
punishment for breaches. Only Alexander, the Diadochoi, and the Senate (after 146
B C ) seem to have had enough authority to impose settlements. The city of Rhodes
might also have played such a role for a cer tain time, especially during the third and at
the beginning of the second centuries.
City-states were reconciled by way of alliance treaties, which settled their past
dif ferences and determined their future relations (e.g. symmachia), as well as by
various judicial procedures which multiplied and intensified with time: mutual agree
ments of inter-marriage law (epigamia), of proper ty law (egktesis) and even reciprocity
of civic rights (isopoliteia: Gawantka 1975); purely judicial agreements (symbola)
opened the cour ts of other cities to the citizens of par ticipating city-states; proxeny
decrees multiplied (Marek 1984), as did decrees of asylia (Rigsby 1996), notably on
the par t of the Aitolians who, by exempting cer tain cities from the risk of pillage,
created a web of relationships in the Aegean Sea. `The details naturally varied greatly
from one case to the next, but there was a strong continuity in the spirit and
operation of negotiations from the classical period to its Hellenistic successor. The
world of the city-states persisted from one era to the next' (PrÂe aux 1961: 259).
5 Conclusion
According to LÂ eve Ã que (1968: 279), there were really only four shor t periods of peace
in the Hellenistic world between 323 and 150: 299±297, 249±248, 205±204 and
159±149. Subsequently, war essentially raged without interruption. And although
wars did not erupt ever ywhere at the same time, their impact on the international
political landscape was never theless widespread. Sometimes harsh and cruel, they also
bore witness to acts of chivalr y (Poliorketes, Gonatas, Pyrrhos) and clemency (treat

ment of prisoners, recognition of the territorial immunity of cer tain city-states or
sanctuaries) (Shipley 2000: 80±3). Fighting no longer took place as it did in archaic
and early classical times, and instead saw the fur ther development of practices intro
duced during the four th centur y, at least insofar as the great kingdoms were con
cerned. Fur thermore, on a smaller scale, the study of the armies in Hellenistic Greek
city-states clearly shows an unconditional and enduring attachment of civic bodies to
their territor y and their city. On this subject, it is safe to say that for the city-states,
especially those in the Aegean Basin, there never was a break with the past as
fundamental as that which scholars still too often describe when discussing such key
historical events as the creation of the Hellenic League by Philip II, Alexander's
conquest, or the subsequent division of the Empire by Alexander's successors.
The defence of the city-state and its territor y remained a national, and purely civic,
preoccupation. It lay at the hear t of all the relations maintained with the outside
world by Hellenistic city-states, regardless of whom they dealt with. Thus, whether it
was a matter of negotiating with a king or his representative for the withdrawal of a
royal garrison (e.g. at Er ythrai, SIG
3 285), or with regards to a treaty creating a
militar y alliance between two cities (e.g. Miletos with Herakleia under LatmosSIG
3
633), the desire to preser ve territorial integrity and civic independence was always a
central motivation for city-states. Likewise, the multiplication of agreements leading
to the amalgamation of the territor y of a small city or township into that of its larger
neighbour also underscores this attachment to the land and the desire to enlarge its
area, or at least to maintain its limits. Just as the citizen-soldier is closely linked to the
origins of democracy and to the histor y of democracy during the classical period, he
remains relevant to the histor y of the city-state and to the persistence of democracy
during the Hellenistic period.
As I bring this chapter to a close, it seems appropriate that I return to the question
posed at the outset and which has ser ved as an organizing thread: Did war fare during
the Hellenistic period change with the advent of the kings as dominant powers in
Greek political histor y, which henceforth encompassed the whole of the known
world? However impor tant this question might be, it remains dif ficult to of fer a
definitive or straight answer. Although the kingdoms left a profound mark on the
destiny of the Greek world and the face of international politics, the more traditional
world of the city-state, the same one which had begun to slowly take shape during the
eighth centur y B C , had not changed ver y much. In good times and bad, the defensive
needs of the city-state remained the same, even with the addition of other, less
immediate, considerations which went far beyond the local context. While the city
states could not ignore this additional level of political consideration, they did not
necessarily have a firm grasp on its significance. War fare during the Hellenistic period
took various forms and benefited, in terms of its technical and tactical development,
from financial means which, up to that point in Greek histor y, were unparalleled.
From this perspective, it can be said that the appearance of the kings on the political
landscape constituted a factor of change in the practice of war. Likewise, the necessity
of preser ving the integrity of states originally conquered by force, and the inevitable
temptation to subsequently expand their borders, made the resor t to armed conflict a
common feature of international politics. But was this really a new state of af fairs for
the Greeks? It is true that, except for the unique case of the conquest of Messenia
by the Spar tans, the Greek city-states were not tempted by wars of conquest;
Warfare 387



nonetheless, their attachment to the lands they defended sunk roots so deep in
histor y that only mythology could explain it. But to resolve territorial conflicts ±
that is to say those which touched the states at the ver y deepest level ± the militar y
solution had long presented itself as the only one imaginable. `In the politics of
ancient city-states . . . , if there was a conflict, usually a territorial conflict, between two
city-states, normally bordering each other, and if it was impossible to settle the
dif ferences peaceably, violence and war were the solution, and Greek histor y is
covered by such battles fought over a piece of territor y taken, lost, retaken,
depending on the circumstances' (Rober t
OMS
5.141). For the Greeks, violence
was an ordinar y political tool (Garlan 1972: 197±203).

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Piracy and the Slave-Trade
Vincent Gabrielsen
1 Introduction
We cannot fully appreciate the special quality which the concept of `freedom' had for
the inhabitants of the ancient world without taking into account a grim fact of life:
that a person was also viewed as a commodity, to be appropriated, sold, or resold to a
new owner. The per vasiveness of chattel slaver y as an institution ensured that ever y
free individual, high or low, had to live with the fear of losing his or her personal
liber ty and thus become another person's property. When it occurred, such a horren
dous change in a person's legal status was almost unexceptionally accompanied by the
no less ruinous act of physical dislocation to a far-of f place. As a result, individuals
were deprived of one of their most cherished privileges, families were deprived of
their members, and cities of their ver y life-blood, that is, their citizens. No wonder,
therefore, that freedom was regarded as both a precious and a highly precarious
possession. Hence its intimate, even though intricate, relationship to another
highly-valued notion: `protection'.
The sources of peril were actually few, but immensely grave. To fall into captivity in
connection with war fare was one of them. To be suddenly seized by someone
exercising the customar y right of reprisal (syle, rhysia) was another. A third one was
to be snatched by a band of brigands or pirates. All three of these involved the use of
violence, made no fine distinctions between humans and other valuables, put the
captives wholly at the mercy of their captors and, as we shall see, shared between them
some fundamental structural features. Still, whatever its specific mode, the act of
appropriation itself was but the prelude to a fur ther operation, whereby the `catch'
entered for good the domain of profit-generating transactions. For like any other
commodity that of human captives was par t and parcel (and a ver y large one at that)
of the wider economic life, with an established supply/demand system, points of
distribution and sale, a host of pur veyors, shippers, dealers and buyers and price
setting routines ± all in all, a market in humans; and, of course, the same system also
expedited the movement, or rather the recycling, of captives already possessing the
status of slaves. All three `sources of peril', jointly exercising absolute control over at



least the supply side of the market, carried prime responsibility for the intermar riage
between organized violence and economic activity.
The whole gamut, from the capture of the `commodity' to the final transaction
deciding its fate, was operating in the classical period and continued doing so in the
Hellenistic world, without anyone (state or individual) ever feeling any compunction
about it. Already in the four th centur y, Aristotle had thrown a good measure of his
intellectual weight into demonstrating the primacy of this business as a per fectly
rational and justified component of economic life: man-hunters, he explained, are
those who live from `booty-seizure' (leisteia), a profession as natural as animal
hunting and fishing; man-hunting, moreover, is a sub-categor y of war fare, which
itself is by nature an ar t of acquisition (ktetike techne) practised against `such people
who, even though naturally created for subjection, do not submit to it voluntarily'
(Pol. 1256a36±b27). Should anyone have had moral scr uples about engaging in
`freedom stealing' and slave traf ficking, that might indeed have been the proper
antidote. But in fact no one did. In the period after Alexander, all went on happily
obser ving the old convention ± indeed `a universal law' (Xen. Cyr. 7.5.73) ± that
persons and their proper ty appropriated in war belong to those who had seized them.
Serious trouble began whenever this ver y convention was obser ved (and it was so
frequently) by people who, allegedly or factually, disregarded all other conventions
about the use of organized violence. Enter the infamous pair: the pirate and the
brigand.
2 Hellenistic Piracy
`The pirate', Tarn remarked, `had a most useful place in the economy of the old
world; he was the general slave merchant' (1913: 88). Concurring with this, Ros
tovtzef f adds: `Scores of inscriptions refer to piratical raids and to the tragic experi
ences of men, women and children kidnapped by the pirates and sold into
slaver y. . . . This ancient practice had now [in the Hellenistic period] become ver y
common and was carried on with cynical r uthlessness' (1941: I.202). Subsequent
scholarship agrees that the dif ference from previous periods was above all a quantita
tive one: its intensity having increased (at times dramatically) in Hellenistic times,
predator y activity came to play a markedly greater role in the slave-trade than it had
before (P È ohl 1993: 33±6, but see de Souza 1999: 59±64). Any attempt to quantify
that role more precisely is, of course, defeated by our lack of the necessar y data; for
instance, our current knowledge about such a basic requisite for any fur ther analysis
as the size of `slave populations' remains deplorable (cf. W. Harris 1980). But even if
we had the figures themselves, the task of estimating, diachronically, the relative
volume and value of the pirate's share in the slave-trade would hardly become any
the more easier. To appreciate this we shall have to look more closely at predator y
activity, especially the economic processes of which it was par t (sections 2±4) and the
historical str uctures defining its character (section 5).
As historical phenomena, piracy and brigandage are by far the most complex of the
`sources of peril' mentioned above. What needs to be noted at the outset is that in the
Hellenistic period, as earlier, one and the same label ( leistes, or the less common
peirates) was used indiscriminately for the practitioners of both activities. Thus we are
really faced with a single phenomenon, not two. To concentrate on the seaward
390 Vincent Gabrielsen



operateur only (as is done in this chapter), is simply to acknowledge that in volume his
activity surpassed that of the brigand: His chosen element enabled him to prey over
an area that was both much larger and far richer in catch, that is, the high seas as well
as the Mediterranean and Black Sea littorals; in addition, his unequally greater ease of
movement, besides minimizing the risk of capture, af forded him the advantage of
hitting, within a given time, many more targets than his landward counterpar t could
hope for; moreover, even though he plied the seas by ship, his operations were often
amphibious. It seems therefore defensible to regard the maritimeleistes as historically
and economically the more significant of the two, a fact also accentuated by the
substantial investment of precisely that agent in the technological improvement of his
`hunting equipment', the light, fast-sailing galley; an investment that put him in `the
vanguard of militar y progress' (Davies 1984: 286).
Modern scholarship, too, recognizes this to be the archetypal predator, who, the
violent par t of his work being done, brought his human merchandise to the points of
distribution and sale. Indeed, a slave market was to be found in practically ever y por t.
Some of them, notably Side, Phaselis, Alexandria, Rhodes and Delos, as well as the
por ts of Crete and the Black Sea, at various periods, dwar fed the rest in scale. Fine
grained evidence detailing the economic per formance of these seaward markets and
their inland counterpar ts, such as, for instance, Karian Mylasa (Men. Sik. 3±7), is
sparse in the extreme; that applies especially to the numbers of piracy-related captives
which these markets expedited monthly or annually. Delos, of course, is a well-known
exception. And yet, it is only by chance that we are informed of the island's function
as a market in the late third centur y (SEG 3.666) ± and as a pirate base in the early
second centur y (SIG 3 582). More impor tantly, Strabo of fers a vivid description of the
momentous boost experienced by Delos after 145 (Maroti 1969±70; Rauh 1993:
41±68), an expansion of the island's in- and outgoing traf fic in slaves that might have
prompted the construction of facilities related to that trade (Coarelli 1982: the
Delian `Agora of the Italians' was essentially a slave market). Yet even that description
is not an independent comment on economic trends but simply par t of an explanation
of political events, i.e. violent upheaval in the Southeastern Mediterranean and
Roman disinterest in it. Strabo says:
The export of slaves was an especially strong inducement to this wrongdoing, as it
was extremely profitable. They were easily caught and not too far away there was the
market of Delos; large and wealthy, it could have a turnover of ten thousand slaves a day.
From where comes the proverb, `Merchant, sail in, unload, ever ything has been sold'.
The cause of all this was that the Romans became wealthy after the destruction of
Car thage and Corinth and used many slaves. The pirates, seeing what easy profit there
was, bloomed for th in large numbers, operating as both pirates and slave-traders.
(14.5.2)
That all these slave markets, small and great, were also fed by the pirates themselves,
often directly ± note Strabo's switch from `pirate' to `merchant', when the captor
enters the harbour ± is thus incontestable. What seems less so is the notion that the
`open market' constituted the pirate's sole, or even main, field of economic activity.
There is much to indicate that, when it came to selling his human merchandise, the
pirate's first choice was another and equally impor tant branch of the market.
Piracy and the Slave-Trade 391



3 Ransom: the `Domestic' Branch of the Market
In about 470 the citizens of Teos, no doubt as an act of despair, pronounced a
collective curse against those of their citizens and others who practised piracy ( ML
23). But as time passed their imprecation apparently lost much of its force; around
200 Teos suf fered a devastating assault by pirates, who, holding a large number of its
inhabitants as hostages, demanded a seemingly astronomical sum of money in
ransom. A grand-scale fund-raising operation was immediately launched for buying
back the captives (SEG 44.949). A similar mishap hit the city of Aigiale on Amorgos
in the third centur y. Arriving by sea suddenly one night, a gang led by one Sokleidas
raided and plundered the countr yside, a reminder of the amphibious nature of
piratical operations; then, after having prudently scuttled the ships in the harbour
to prevent a chase, they made a quick escape with, among other valuables, thir ty girls,
women and other persons, free and slave. Shor tly after wards two among the citizen
captives persuaded the gang-leader, in return for ransom, to release the free persons
and some of the freedmen and slaves, while they themselves volunteered to stay as
hostages until the agreed sum of money had been paid. Thus, even though some loss
was suf fered (i.e. a number of freedmen and slaves were excluded from the bargain),
the worst was avoided, thanks to the courageous initiative of the two citizens, who
were recompensed accordingly by the city with rewards of honour (SIG3 521).
These instances are not unique. Timesa, a woman citizen of the Amorgan city of
Arkesine, ransomed from her own means all the citizens who had been taken by
pirates (SEG 29.762). During the Chremonidean war Epichares, the militar y com
mander of the Attic deme Rhamnous, made a deal with the pirates who had captured
a number of the deme's inhabitants; the sum of 120 drachmas was paid for each
captive (SEG 24.154). In roughly the same period, a foreign resident of Ephesos
ransomed both free and slaves from pirates (Rober t 1960: 132±5). Later in the
centur y Eumaridas, a citizen of Cretan Kydonia living in Athens, contributed from
his own pocket towards the 120 talent ransom agreed for the release of `a large
number of citizens and others', who had been captured by the Aitolian Boukris and
carried off to Crete; Eumaridas even lent the captives money for their travel expenses
(SIG 3 535, trans. Austin 88). Around the same time ambassadors from Aulon on
Naxos successfully negotiated the ransoming of 280 of their citizens from Aitolian
raiders (SIG 3 520). While sailing to the Crimea to announce the Pythian Festival of
194, Delphian theoroi, an especially exposed group of travellers, fell into the hands
of pirates and were then ransomed by the citizens of Chersonesos (SIG 3 604). And
so for th.
What all these instances attest is the `domestic' branch of the market, a branch also
used by rulers and city-states for conver ting their war captives into cash; this is one of
the elements making piracy and war fare par ts of a single historical structure. If the
captive was a free person, relatives were those immediately expected to put up the
money required in ransom (e.g. Livy 34.50.5; App. Hann. 28). The same goes for
entire cities. In 210 the inhabitants of Aigina asked their captor, the Roman procon
sul P. Sulpicius, to allow them to appeal to kindred states for payment of ransom
money. Being ultimately assured that this was the custom (ethos) of the Greeks, the
proconsul reversed his initial denial to a positive answer, but the Aiginetans were
largely failed by their `kindred states' with the result that they were all sold into
392 Vincent Gabrielsen



slaver y (Polyb. 9.42.5±8). If, on the other hand, the captive was a slave, the obliga
tion to pay ransom fell on the owner, provided he found it wor thwhile. Mass capture,
demographically vexing for any city, could instance the canvassing of community
wide financial suppor t, either in the form of loans to be repaid with interest (cf. the
case of Teos above), or as free gifts (cf. the case of Eumaridas above). Thus an old
means of gaining distinction via private benefaction gained new impetus, at least in
texts published on stone: the public-spirited man who had helped ransom captives, a
topos in four th-centur y Attic orator y (Pritchett 1991b: 269±71), sur faces all the
more frequently in Hellenistic inscriptions.
Underneath all this, however, lay three hard facts: Firstly, that sometimes the
captive was failed by his own relatives, a situation which, if the city did not step in
to recover its `life-blood', forced him to put his fate in the hands of profiteering
money lenders. Secondly, that, mostly as a consequence of the latter, often the bill for
his release had to be footed by the captive himself, failing which he became the
property of his ransomer; the legal complexities of these matters, it should be noted,
exercised thinkers from Aristotle to Cicero (Eth. Nic. 1165a; Of f. 2.16.56). Thirdly,
and more to the point, that what the man-hunter exploited here was not the old
vocation of slave-traf ficking but the perhaps older habit of extor tion. In economic
terms, `freedom-selling' was far more lucrative for the simple reason that humans
could fetch a much higher price if sold back to their own ± or to themselves ± than as
slaves in the open market.
The ransom of 120 talents paid for the victims shipped by Boukris to Crete is
definitely a ver y large sum. By comparison in 415 the Athenian general Nikias sold
the entire population of Hykkara in South Italy as slaves, about 7500 people, for
exactly the same amount (Thuc. 6.62). Even if the price per head in the Boukris
incident is reckoned as low as 500 drachmas, the resulting total number of captives
taken to Crete would still be too high to render that (presumed) price credible. Half a
talent (3,000 dr.) seems more like it. Equally high sums were demanded by states,
which often ransomed their war captives out of the same economic rationale as the
pirates (Ducrey 1968: 246±54; Volkmann 1990: 110±18, 165±7; Pritchett 1991b:
247±55). In 189, for instance, the Epeirotes initially demanded five talents for each of
the four Aitolian envoys they had captured; after fur ther negotiations the sum came
down to three talents per head (Polyb. 21.26). Roman captives in Achaia went for
500 drachmas and in Delphi for 300 to 600 drachmas each (Livy 34.50; Hatzfeld
1913). Earlier, in 254, the Romans themselves released the 14,000 inhabitants of
Sicilian Panormos who could af ford the 2000 drachma ransom; the remaining
13,000 were sold as slaves (Diod. 23.18). Noticeably lower than these sums is the
120 drachmas per head demanded by the kidnappers of the people from Rhamnous in
Athens (see above). But price variation is what would be expected, anyway, since the
pirate most likely set the price tag on his catch individually, according to status and
wealth; Hannibal is repor ted to have done just that with his captives from the battle of
Cannae in 216 (Livy 22.58). The same logic underlies the stor y about Julius Caesar's
capture by pirates, perhaps on his way to Rhodes, in around 74 B C . Realizing what a
`big fish' that they had caught, the pirates demanded 20 talents in ransom. Piqued by
this, Caesar raised the amount to 50 talents; after 38 days of captivity, the sum arrived
from Miletos (Plut. Caes. 2). Even when due allowance is made, as indeed it must be,
for an upward bias in some of these amounts, they are well in excess of ordinar y `slave
Piracy and the Slave-Trade 393



prices' in the open market (Ducr ey 1968: 248±9). So the pira te Sokle idas whose raid
on Aig iale was obser ved above did not really have to be `per suaded' to rele ase those of
his cap tives who could pay ran som; if he, just as any other in that profe ssion,
abstained from exp loiting the `domesti c' branch of the marke t, a middlem an stood
ready to profi t from freshly -caugh t persons.
This latter agent is a shadow y figu re, whose ro le can only be disclose d by lifti ng the
shroud of phi lanthrop y us ually envelopin g h is ac tion. Our cleare st evid ence for the
way he operat ed stems from shor tly after 368. T he A thenian Nikostr atos was cap
tured by a trireme and sold to a man in Aig ina. Hear t-brea king letter s were imme di
ately dispatch ed to Nikost ratos' family at hom e describi ng the cap tive's `dreadful
condition' and inf or ming them that he woul d be rele ased for a ransom of 2600
drachm as. Eventuall y , Nikostrat os, receivin g no help from his family , had to bor row
this amount as well as 300 d rachmas for trav el expense s from others who demande d
payment of b oth princip al and interest within thir ty da ys or else the y woul d claim him
as their prope r ty ([Dem .] 53.6 ±10). It was not the original captor/ ven dor who
profite d most from this transact ion but rather the retaile r in Aig ina. Th e sa me
situatio n is indica ted by Helleni stic evidenc e. In the early second cent ur y , Epikl es, a
Cretan based on Cypr us, was seized by pirates and then `sold [as sl ave] in Amphissa' ;
but soon afte r wards Epikles gained his freedom by some how raising the mon ey with
which to pay `the ransom', ta lytra, to the man who had bought him (SIG
3
622).
When the Karian city of T heangela commend s a Del ian for ha ving `purch ased' a
number of Theange lan women who wer e `a mong the boot y that res ulted from the
raid of the pirates', the suspicion arises that his action was not pure altr uism but that
he let them retur n home on receipt of ransom (SEG 3.666). The elusive middleman ,
using the o pen marke t as an inter mediat e point, was some times the pirate' s close
collab orator, so metimes his compe titor.
Judged by the number of documents that refer to it, the ransoming of captives,
especi ally by pira tes, seems indee d to have occup ied a margina l place in this market in
humans ( so Pritchett 1991b: 283). Not necessar ily so, ho wever, if the emph asis is
shifted to the character of these documents. For what we do have a record of are
precisel y those cases which, by the ir ver y natu re, we re habit ually dee med merito rious
to be publicize d on inscript ions: that is, the inter ventio n of benefacto rs, collecti ve or
individual . What we totally lack (and shall prob ably never get) is epig raphic evi dence
for the presum ably far superior num ber of cases of c aptives being bought back by their
own families, so mething usually not publicize d through ins criptions . T he more
probable view is therefore that the `d omesti c' b ranch of the marke t was b oth substan
tial and the pirates ' fa vourite. One class of cap tives, of course, more often remaine d
outside than inside that branch: per sons alread y possess ing the stat us of slave s. The
redistribut ion of these to new owners c onstituted a relatively lar ger par t in the overall
contribut ion of pi racy to the slave-trade (Finley 1962: 57±8; de Souza 1999: 64±5).
If, for some reason, the pira te proved unable to rans om his hos tages, he tur ned them
over to the professional deale rs who a lso helped ar mies move the ir captives.
Never the less, au ctioning captives in the slave market and obta ining ran som for
their release were transac tions situate d ver y closely within one and the same spectr um
of econo mic acti vity , often so closely that they became tangled. No one woul d
therefore have bee n able to quantify even approx imately the pirate 's share in the
slave-trade . Strabo's `10,00 0 slave s a d ay' for post -145 Del os is no more than a

shor thand for `exceptionally many'; nor does it of fer a clue about how many of these
were bought back by their own and how many went on to join the existing hordes of
forced labour.
4 The Naval Protector
Alongside piracy, another time-honoured tradition was inherited by the Hellenistic
world: the obligation (purpor tedly a moral one) of the hegemonic power currently
enjoying maritime supremacy (thalassocracy) to fight, and preferably to suppress, that
perennial evil. Whoever wielded power was expected to of fer protection. A long
succession of these eminent `policemen of the seas' is paraded in our record. King
Minos, archaic Corinth and classical Athens number among the early representatives;
the task was taken over by Alexander, then by successors such as Antigonos and
Demetrios and the Ptolemies; in the mid third centur y it was the turn of the
Rhodians, and from 102 it was taken up in earnest by the Romans, who ef fectively
finished the job off when Pompey in 67 annihilated the claimed plague of those times,
the so-called Cilician pirates, right at their ver y base in Korakesion.
The relevance of this vast topic to our own derives from the propensity of modern
scholarship to use this `succession list' as an index of the fluctuations in the volume of
piratical activity. Briefly, the assumption is that periods distinguished by the absence
or presence of a strong maritime hegemon are also periods of flourishing or declining
piracy: for instance, Plutarch records the plundering of thir teen sanctuaries and the
capture of 400 cities by pirates in the early first centur y owing to the absence of a
power to check their activities (Pomp. 24). By the same token, it becomes possible to
isolate periods during which the volume of piracy-related slave-trade increased or
decreased (Ormerod 1924: chapters. 4, 6; Rostovtzef f 1941: I.195±204, II.607±10
with notes). However, for four main reasons, which can only be touched upon here,
all this is too simplistic.
Firstly, piratical contingents were ver y often incorporated into the fleets of major
states, including that of the naval hegemon. The archpirate who put his flotilla and
brilliant tactical skills at the ser vice of the kings is a common figure in Hellenistic naval
operations (Launey 1949: 34±35, 180±95; Ducrey 1968: 178). Ample historiographic
coverage is received by a few celebrities: the Phokian Ameinias (hired by Antigonos
Gonatas), the Illyrians Agron and Demetrios of Pharos (employed by Demetrios II and
Antigonos Doson respectively), their compatriot Skerdilaidas (in the ser vice of Philip
V), and the Aitolian Dikaiarchos, who having ser ved Philip V shifted his allegiance to
Egypt, where Ptolemaic favour materialized in the grant of a lucrative concession
placing him in a key-post within the Egyptian slave market (Westermann 1929: 1±3,
22±5; cf. Launey 1949: 192). But these should not get all of our attention at the
expense of their far more numerous, though less well-known, colleagues: for instance,
the archpirate Nikandros, who in 190 operated in Antiochos III's fleet, or one
Timokles, who ser ved under Demetrios Poliorketes during the siege of Rhodes (Livy
37.11.16; App. Syr. 24; Diod. 20.97). The latter's flotilla of three ships was deemed to
be the best one among the host of pirates who had joined Demetrios ± the sor t of
profiteers who customarily `rush together where there are wars and plundering' (Diod.
20.110); interestingly, in addition to these there were some 1000 ships belonging to
`merchants and marketeers', who during the siege operated in exactly the same way as
Piracy and the Slave-Trade 395



the pirates (Diod. 20.82.4±5, 84.5±6, 97.5). What was in it for both the pirates and the
`merchants', besides the rich loot to be had if Rhodes fell, is indicated by the deal made
by Demetrios and the Rhodians: that those of their captives who could pay ransom
should be exchanged, a free man going for a thousand, a slave for five hundred
drachmas (Diod. 20.84.6); implicit in this agreement is the circumstance that all
those who proved unable to pay these amounts were to be sold as slaves. So, frequently,
the pirate and the `policeman of the seas' stood not in opposition to each other but co
operated. That was recognized long ago (Rostovtzef f 1941: I.196, 607±8; Garlan
1978). What has not been suf ficiently stressed is that as a consequence the proceeds
from piracy, humans and other valuables, went piggyback on, and therefore were
indistinguishable from, those of war fare (Heinen 1976±77).
Secondly, the suppression of piracy was generally used by the maritimehegemon as a
mere pretext for pursuing his own political objectives, that is, first and foremost to
legitimize his right to rule and to increase his own power (de Souza 1999: 241±2). To
this should be added that when politically or economically oppor tune he might
choose to look the other way. Strabo, for instance, charges the Ptolemies with
assisting the Cilician pirates out of hostility to the Seleukids and then, judging
carefully what he considers politically correct (or safe), he comes close to saying
that the Romans did nothing ef fective to curb the Cilicians mainly out of economic
oppor tunism: the westward movement, via Delos, of eastern captives coincided with
Roman interest in satisfying the increased demand for forced labour, a demand which
according to modern scholarship was created by the expanding Italian agriculture
(Strabo 15.5.2; Hopkins 1978: chapter 2). A corresponding demand, this time
arising east of the Adriatic and satisfied by regular war fare, is evidenced by the
counter-flow of huge numbers of Italian captives who had been sold by Hannibal
all over Greece after 216; the fate of these captives became a strong Roman concern in
194 and again in 189 (Diod. 28.13; Livy 34.50, 37.60; cf. Hatzfeld 1913). The
economic and demographic consequences of war fare are also reflected in numerous
other massive movements of human resource both within the territor y of Old Greece
and Macedonia and between the new Hellenistic monarchies: for example, after his
victor y over Demetrios at Gaza in 312 Ptolemy brought 8000 captives to Egypt,
while his successors maintained a fairly steady supply mainly from Syria and Phoenicia
(Diod. 19.85.3; Ducrey 1968: 83±7; Volkmann 1990; Pritchett 1991b: 226±34).
Economic oppor tunism is in evidence also with minor rulers, not least those of the
Black Sea areas. Indeed, their stand is often described in positive terms. Around 240
the Bithynian king Ziaelas reassured the people of Kos that he would guarantee the
safety of their seafarers (RC 25); Eumelos, king of the Kimmerian Bosporos, is said to
have `cleared the sea of pirates', waging war against the Heniochoi, Tauroi and
Achaei, barbarian tribes which regularly plundered those sailing in the region
(Diod. 20.25). Yet, the rich flow of high-quality slaves from the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean repor ted by Polybios (4.38) only makes sense in the light of Strabo's
later remarks about the piratical activities of the Heniochoi, Zygoi and Achaei: that
`they are sometimes assisted by those who hold power in the Bosporos, the latter
supplying them with landings and a market and the means of disposing their loot'
(11.2.12). In shor t, naval powers were prepared to exploit piracy in order to cultivate
their own interests. The `policeman of the seas' was not really interested in the
elimination of piracy.

Thirdly, that lack of interest became fur ther assisted by a strong economic incentive
inherent in the per formance of the naval hegemon as a genuine protector, prostates.
Protection was a marketable commodity in ver y high demand, which could be
purchased by consumers through payments in cash or in kind; tribute is one form
of such payments. Politically and psychologically, the termsphylake or asphaleia which
designated that product had come to rank almost as high in value as the word
`freedom'. In the four th centur y Athenian naval commanders would sell protection
to traders and their cities, sometimes for huge sums of money which were euphemis
tically known as `benevolences' and routed through the treasur y (Gabrielsen 2001b:
235±6). This practice was later adopted by Athens' Hellenistic successors, in par ticu
lar by the Rhodians. In 298 Delos paid, probably to Rhodes, at least 5000 drachmas
for its `protection against Tyrrhenian pirates' (IG 11.2.148.73). In 220 the impos
ition by Byzantion of tolls on shipping to and from the Black Sea compelled all the
traders to complain to the Rhodians, `as they regarded them to be the protectors of
those using the sea' (Polyb. 4.47). Political issues aside, the traders were surely
discontented with having a new item of expenditure (i.e. the tolls) added to an
existing one (i.e. protection charges), while the Rhodians, taking prompt action,
were keen to show their ability to deliver what they were highly esteemed for. In
this line of business a good reputation was essential: by calling a special class of
choice-craft in their fleet `protection ships' the Rhodians adver tised both their
resolution to per form the role of protector seriously and the high quality of their
own product (Gabrielsen 1997: 108±9).
Where the `policeman of the seas' failed (or demanded exorbitantly high protection
prices), the raider himself moved in to grab a par t of this market. In the mid third
centur y, for example, the Aitolians made a bid for the Aegean market (e.g. SIG 3
442.5: protection to Chios; cf. Benecke 1934; Scholten 2000). In these and other
instances, though, the profit took the form of political advantages rather than of hard
currency: renowned raider-states, such as the Aitolians or Cretans, frequently granted
potential victim-cities immunity (asylia) from violent seizure (Ducrey 1968:
289±311; documents in Rigsby 1996). Others, however, insisted on receiving cash.
Early in the third centur y the Istrians had been paying the Thracian ruler Zoltes and
his `pirates' for abstaining from raiding their city and its territor y, first five talents,
then 7500 drachmas (SEG 24.1095, trans. Austin 98). Towards the end of our
period, the Lipari islands were buying exemption from raids by paying the pirates a
fixed amount of money ever y year (Cic. IIVerr. 3.85). Thus the perennial fear of a
violent assault fuelled a thriving field of economic activity, which for most of the time
was under the control of the naval protector. Eliminating those producing that fear
would inevitably result in his having to shut down his operations in the business of
protection, something not only economically undesirable but politically catastrophic.
Four thly, and finally, the naval protector's systematic and organized pirate chasing,
for which the word `war' (polemos) was most often used, was itself a more direct
source of profit. In their treaty with the Cretan city of Hierapytna, the Rhodians spell
out the obligation of their allies: to par ticipate with all their strength and at their own
expense `when the Rhodians wage war at sea against the pirates or those who provide
them with shelter or assistance'. The text goes on to specify that in the division of any
profits that might accrue from such campaigns the Rhodians are to receive the largest
share (SIG 3 581, trans. Austin 95). Indeed, just as in all other operations of this kind,
Piracy and the Slave-Trade 397



a `war' it was and so the terminology of war was appropriately used for the entire haul
of the naval `protector', whether captives (aichmalotoi) or generally booty (laphyron).
Accordingly, the only law applying to the catch, persons as well as valuables, was the
old `universal law', that persons and their proper ty appropriated in war belong to the
captor (cf. section 1 above), which in most instances meant that the fate of the pirates
themselves and of their own captives was decided neither by a cour t of law nor by
humanitarian principles, but simply by the price they could fetch in ransom (e.g.
Polyb. 27.14) or in the slave market (Diod. 20.93; Gabrielsen 2001b: 236; contra:
Ducrey 1968: 191±3). Like the proceeds of any war, these ones too went to the
cof fers of the `protector', after of course he had offered par t of them as a tithe to a
principal deity (e.g. I.Lindos 88).
Another interesting case concerns the resolute and solicitous action of the
Astypalaians, known from an inscription of the late second or early first centur y.
After they had successfully chased the raiders who had been harassing Ephesos, they
brought the captured pirates and their Ephesian victims back to Astypalaia. The
pirates they `punished immediately in a manner wor thy of their wickedness'. The
rescued Ephesians themselves (citizens only) they treated `like their own children',
providing for their daily needs, while, most commendably, they took care of the
upbringing (agoge) and education (paideia) of all the free children who had been
seized. To interpret `punishment' as capital punishment is to load the word with more
legalistic content than it can possibly bear here; and being sold as slaves is a punish
ment equally wor thy of the pirates' `wickedness'. Again, we should not let the
rhetoric of philanthropy ± plentiful in this fragmentar y document ± blur our vision:
after one appearance the slaves among the pirates' captives vanish completely; more
impor tantly, one wants to know why the Astypalaians had kept the distressed Ephe
sians and their children away from their home city for so long. The reality behind all
this apparent care may well be that all the slaves were sold, while the Ephesians were
allowed to return home only after ransom had been for warded from Ephesos; that
they meanwhile had a pleasant stay in Astypalaia is not refuted by this view (IG 12.3.
Suppl. 1286).
War against the pirates meant raids on the raiders themselves, which if successful
resulted in the seizure of `booty from booty'. Between the pirate and the slave market
stood the biggest fish of all, one representing the pirate's greatest occupational
hazard: that is, the fleet of the naval protector. Hence an additional reason for the
pirate to prefer a quick ransom deal. From an economic point of view, both the pirate
and the `policeman of the seas' were enmeshed in the same business. Taking a count
of the captives shipped to Delos or to any other slave market was not really a dif ficult
task; telling who among these captives had fallen into that plight because of piracy was
a different matter.
The upshot of this all is that the yardstick conventionally used to gauge the
intensity of piratical activity and, by extension, the fluctuations in the volume of
piracy-related slave-trade is deceptive.
5 Who Were the Pirates?
In the preceding sections, `pirate' and `piracy' have been used as if they were
uncomplicated terms. They are not. Two major advances made in this area by recent
398 Vincent Gabrielsen



scholarship should be noted. One is an increasing acknowledgement of the fact that
`pirate' and `piracy', or rather their principal Greek equivalents, leistes and leisteia,
were subjective terms, consistently applied, especially from the four th centur y on
wards, as pejorative labels on enemies and their acts. Endowed with an admirable
stereotyping ef fect, one that quintessentially flagged out `inhuman' as well as `illegit
imate' behaviour, they of fered themselves as convenient tools by means of which a
dominant power, often assisted by histor y writers, sought to constr uct a specific
image of its political opponents ± whether rival states, recalcitrant allies, or head
strong insurrectionists. In that sense, `the dif ference between war fare and piracy is in
the eye of the beholder' (Pritchett 1991b: 317). Inevitably, the same holds tr ue also
about the dif ference between war captives and the pirates' captives.
The other advance is a radical shift in the basic explanator y tenet, that is the answer
to the question: what made people resor t to acts which our sources describe as
piratical? Earlier scholarship's inclination to point at `personal, destr uctive dispos
ition' has been abandoned in favour of explanations that stress `social and political
pressures'. Thus, whereas Ormerod spoke of the `r uf fians', Garlan, Br ul Âeand others
prefer now to speak of the `underprivileged classes' and `politically oppressed people',
who were forced by circumstances to resor t to unlawful acts with devastating ef fects.
In combination, these new insights por tray piracy as an historical phenomenon
oscillating between two extremes: the realm of political constr ucts and that of reality.
They therefore render it most urgent to meet two challenges: (a) to establish, at least
approximately, the boundar y between constr uct and factual; and, perhaps more
impor tantly, (b) to tr y to determine what, in the eye of any beholder, was the most
essential factor which gave the `booty-seizer' (leistes) his unfor tunate baggage of
`inhumanity' and `illegitimacy'.
First, the limits of the constr uct. Cases of egregious and deliberate terminological
abuse can be dealt with ver y briefly here, even though the record of smear campaigns
launched against prominent adversaries is a long one. For Cicero, for example, Mark
Antony was a mere bandit (Fam. 10.5; 10.6; 12.12). The L ykian r uler Kleon, an
associate of Antony and later of Octavian, was branded by Strabo as a pirate leader
(12.8.8±9). Caesar, too, sweepingly called all his adversaries during the Civil Wars
pirates (BC. 3.110). These and numerous other attacks on an enemy's reputation can
be comfor tably traced back to the four th centur y, when the main protagonists in a
mutual mud-casting contest were the Athenians and the Macedonian king Philip II
(Dem. 10.34; [Dem.] 12.2, 5; 7.14±15). Their malicious character notwithstanding,
such charges were par t of the time-honoured ritual of political denigration, and
indeed the specific terms in which they were made really instanced no ambiguity
either for their authors themselves nor for anybody else.
Some measure of ambiguity, however, enters the picture with a dif ferent set of
instances. Obvious candidates for membership into this class include, firstly, the
Spar tan king Nabis, whose power-political project is cast by our tradition in terms
of his excessive acquisitive drive: he not only filled the Peloponnese with temple
robbers, highwaymen and assassins, the profits of whose misdeeds he shared, but
he also co-operated with the Cretans `in acts of piracy' (Polyb. 13.6±8; Livy
34.32.17±20; contrast Car tledge and Spawfor th 1989: chapter 5). Secondly, there
were army leaders such as the Aitolians Dorimachos and Skopas, whose land- and
seaward operations in the Peloponnese during the latter par t of the third centur y are
Piracy and the Slave-Trade 399



said to have been motivated by their insatiable appetite for booty; Polybios held
Dorimachos to be the embodiment of the `violent and greedy disposition of the
Aitolians' (4.3.5). A third candidate would be the coalition of Cretan cities which
fought against Rhodes and its allies in the so-called First Cretan War, a conflict
purpor tedly caused by acts of Cretan piracy (Diod. 27.3; for inscriptions referring
to seaborne raids during the war: Br ulÂ e 1978: 29±56; Baker 1991).
This ambiguity is at its most pronounced in the long and predator y career of the
Cilicians. Even in the rather sensationalist repor ts of Appian, Dio and Plutarch, it is
inextricably linked to specific power-political conflicts. The emergence of Cilician
piracy is traditionally associated with the unsuccessful revolt of the Seleukid militar y
of ficer Diodotos Tr yphon from his power-base in western Rough Cilicia in the mid
second centur y (Strabo 14.5.2). Then, after Tr yphon's death various local pretend
ers, variably called tyrants, generals, archpirates or kings, attempted to car ve out for
themselves small principalities in Syria and Cilicia (App. Mith. 92, 117; cf. Strabo
14.5.7; Memnon FGrH 434 F1.53; Cic. IIVerr. 5.77); it is especially during these
upheavals that the Cilician slave-trade at Side and Delos is said to have flourished.
A dif ferent kind of conflict, one commonly seen as signalling the peak of Cilician
piracy as a menace in the eastern Mediterranean, broke out in 88. That year marked
the beginning of the Pontic king Mithradates VI's fierce and protracted wars against
Roman r ule, during which the king allegedly received massive assistance from entire
pirate navies (App. Mith. 62±3, 92, 119; but cf. de Souza 1999: 125±8). Another
major conflict was the ver y last and most ef fective of a series of Roman attempts to
suppress political unrest in Southern Anatolia ± Pompey's campaign of 67 ± which
resulted in the elimination of Cilician piracy.
Where constr uct ends and reality begins is problematic. Ambiguity is not least
manifest in the prevailing modern opinion that, although all these and several other
`pirates' were the creation of their political enemies, they did indeed deser ve their
reputation (cf. de Souza 1999: 75 on the Aitolians). Or in the recent, and still
unor thodox, view that the `Cilician pirates' were actually not pirates at all (Avidov
1997; contra Rauh 1998). What creates that ambiguity, however, is simply the
circumstance that these examples concern states or their leading representatives,
who pursued political objectives which strongly challenged the existing hegemonial
order, through large-scale use of unconventional (i.e. predator y) tactics, and/or with
war-chests so poorly fed by conventional fiscal devices as to make `booty-seizure'
(leisteia) a principal mode of financing their operations. It is par ticularly the latter
that blurred even more the thin line separating the application of violence as a means
of enrichment (`booty-seizure') from its application as a means of securing or pro
moting `national'-political interests (war fare proper). Thus the pinning of `piracy' and
related labels onto this kind of per formance was not entirely subjective, though claims
that such a per formance exclusively distinguished some belligerents cer tainly were
subjective. From this point on, however, all else is unequivocally outside the realm of
constr uct. Essential in an appraisal of the prime factors that produced the `genuine'
predator is recognition of two diametrically opposed views held by states on what
constituted legitimate organized violence.
One of these views sur faces in the evidence for the activities of Eumaridas, a Cretan
resident in Athens. Besides having mediated the ransoming of captives taken to Crete
by Boukris (section 3 above), Eumaridas also proved useful to his host countr y in
400 Vincent Gabrielsen



another way. As a member of an Athenian embassy to Crete, he used his persuasive
skills and personal connections there to obtain a positive response to an Athenian
request. The Cretans' cities customarily granted to those sailing into their harbours
and to their own citizens `the right of violent seizure'. Eumaridas, therefore, asked
these cities to revoke that grant (SIG
3
535; on the meaning of hoi katapleousi, Bravo
1980: 824±7, against Br ulÂ e 1978: 16±23). A positive answer to a similar petition by
Athens, one dating from the early second centur y, is preser ved in a fragmentar y
inscription, which announces the decision of an unknown Cretan city to exempt
the Attic territor y from its grant of `the right of violent seizure' ( IG 2
2
1130).
Likewise, Cretan Lattos favoured Teos with a similar exemption ( I.Cret. 1: 111,
no. 2.24±31). So Eumaridas and his co-ambassadors did not ask the Cretan cities
to remove entirely that custom but only to ban its use against Athenian targets.
Another people wholehear tedly subscribing to that custom were the Aitolians.
Indeed, they are said to have held so firmly onto it that in 198/7 a general petition
to remove it was sternly met with the reply that they `would rather remove Aitolia
from Aitolia than that custom'. Polybios presents the Aitolians' custom in the garb of
a quasi-technical expression, `to take booty from booty' ( agein laphyron apo
laphyrou). Then he has one of their most fierce enemies, the Macedonian king Philip
V, explain its precise meaning to the Roman commander Flamininus by giving what
to all intents and purposes is an unabashedly distor ted interpretation of a practice
well-known to all: namely, the issuing by cer tain states of a general permission to their
citizens and others to plunder practically ever yone, including the plunderer himself
(18.4±5; Gabrielsen 2001b: 227 n. 37). Here it is crucial to dif ferentiate between
three types of publicly issued permits for violent seizure: (a) those not limited to a
par ticular occasion or target, of which the `custom' of the Cretans and the Aitolians
mentioned above are examples; (b) those issued by warring states against their enemy
during a par ticular armed conflict (Polyb. 4.36.6: `The Spar tans declared the right of
seizure against the Achaians'); and (c) the proclamations of reprisals ( syle, rhysia),
carried out, at any time, by a community or individuals against another community or
some of its citizens with a view to exacting retribution for wrongs allegedly perpet
rated by the target (Polyb. 4.53.2: `The Knossians proclaimed reprisals against the
Rhodians'; pace Ducrey 1968: 181±2, `unspecified seizure' and `reprisals' are clearly
distinguished in e.g. IG 9 1
2
1, 179.20±1).
What put the first of these into a class of its own were its unlimited field of
application in both space and time and, most significantly, its being regarded as
strictly illegitimate by a number of states. Matters were greatly complicated, however,
by the fact that almost all states recognized the legitimacy of the other two types, even
though they abhorred the ef fects. As in practice all three types were largely indistin
guishable, it was therefore fairly easy for the practitioners of type (a) to claim that they
were actually ef fectuating type (c). Booty-seizure of the `non-licit' kind could thus
become embellished with a legitimate cause. Symptomatic of this was the tendency of
states authorizing `unlimited' illegitimate seizure to make grants of `immunity from
reprisals' to potential victims and so imply that they were abstaining from something
that was per fectly licit. On the issue of what constituted legitimate violence political
communities had entrenched themselves into either one of two opposing camps; and
this, in turn, created plenty of scope for a Manichean world-view (Br ul Âe 1978: 46;
Davies 1984: 286).
Piracy and the Slave-Trade 401



It is true that definite steps towards a tolerable mode of coexistence were taken.
The Aitolians issued ad hoc exemptions from their custom by declaring `the right of
violent seizure' to be inapplicable to the citizens of a cer tain city, for instance to
Athenians or Mytilenians (SV III.470.10; IG IX 12 1, 189.1±6), or to a par ticular
group of professionals, such as the ar tists of Dionysos (SIG 3 399, 507), or, finally, on
a specific occasion such as the Pythian Festival (SIG 3 483.15±16). Such exemptions
were also made by other states and all did so for exactly the same reason: to win
political advantages. Akin to these are two other kinds of ad hoc convention, both of
which add to the evidence showing that the danger of losing one's freedom was real
and immense. One consisted of bilateral agreements by which the signatories bound
themselves to abstain from seizing each other's citizens, as was agreed, for instance,
between Delphi and Achaian Pellana and between Miletos and Phaistos (Haussoullier
1917; Milet I.3, no. 140c.55±9). The other consisted of pledges exchanged by cities
to the effect that they would not knowingly purchase each other's citizens (and
sometimes slaves too), when these were of fered for sale (e.g.SV III.482, trans. Austin
89). All such steps did help to establish inter-communal relations through their
propensity to create, or at least demonstrate, political goodwill. Nonetheless, the
richer they grew in number and variety the more they underscored the insistence of
some states on regarding as an exceptional concession precisely what others held to be
a universally valid convention. In the Hellenistic period the gap separating these two
kinds of states had become unbridgeable.
Just how unbridgeable is illustrated by an incident involving still another people
who recognized the legitimacy of private plunder: the Illyrians. In 230 the Illyrian
Queen Teuta received a formal Roman complaint about the persistent seaborne raids
of her subjects against Italian shipping. Her reply is repor ted by Polybios as follows:
`so far as concerned private activities it was not customar y for Illyrian rulers to
preclude their subjects from augmenting their fortunes at sea', a response so outra
geously unacceptable (and insulting) to the Romans that they reacted immediately
with a declaration of war, the First Illyrian War (2.8.8; Derow, this volume, section 1).
Obviously, the vast cultural distance between the two communities on this point
made mutual forbearance impossible. But Teuta's response brings also to the fore
another impor tant feature distinguishing the of ficial authorizations of privately
conducted plunder: their predominantly economic rationale. Hence they signalled
the continuing adherence, by both grantor and grantee, to the ver y old notion that
organized violence was a per fectly acceptable mode of acquisition (Hom. Od.
14.222±34, 17.424±33, section 1 above); and, as a corollar y of this, that private
enrichment constituted just as legitimate a cause for the use of violence as did the
fur therance of community-wide interests. Maurice Holleaux characterized Illyrian
piracy as `a public institution, a state industr y' (in Ducrey 1968: 180). Actually, the
reverse was the case. For what clashed with Roman ± and for that matter also with
dominant Greek ± perceptions was Queen Teuta's total lack of interest in claiming the
`industr y of plunder' as the exclusive prerogative of the state, one restricted to the
public arena and rigorously guarded through governmental controls. Plunder as such
was not objected to by anyone. Therefore it cannot have been the existence of
disparate moral notions about its practice that situated states into diametrically
opposed camps ± and fuelled the Manichean world-view. Vehement condemnations
of the `inhumanity' of the predator are indeed abundant in our record. Yet besides
402 Vincent Gabrielsen



often turning out to be blatantly hypocritical, these too availed themselves of distinc
tions ± moral or other wise ± whose validity depended on `the eye of the beholder'.
So too did the three major components of a long-term trend obser vable from
Thucydides (1.5) to Plutarch (Ant. 29). The trend itself is quite simply that predator y
activity increasingly attains ethnic specificity, and to such a degree as to create a
widely-used classificator y system that proved as resilient to change as it was overly
simplistic. The first and most conspicuous of its components is reflected in the fact
that the `succession list' of maritime protectors mentioned in section 4 above is
matched by a similar list of `rogue states' or `rogue peoples', all of which had won
renown for their addiction to predator y activity: most notably (and in crude chrono
logical order), the Karians, Ozolian Lokrians, Akarnanians, Tyrrhenians, Illyrians,
Aitolians, Cretans, Pamphylians and Cilicians. The second component consists of the
vir tual correspondence which our sources claim existed between these `rogue states'
and the inhabitants of areas commonly branded with the stigma of cultural and
political backwardness. The third one is that the ver y primitiveness of these peoples
is said to have a direct cause±ef fect relationship with their `addiction' (cf. Thuc. 1.5,
on Asia Minor and western Greece; for Polybios on the Aitolians and Cretans, Davies
1984: 290).
The classification is, therefore, expressed in terms of ethnicity or civilization, but
underlying this there is a much more fundamental dif ference which, in the eye of any
beholder, situated political communities in two diametrically opposed camps. That
dif ference lay in their respective socio-political structures and comes to the sur face in
the way each of them chose to answer the crucial question: who has a legitimate right
to exercise violence? In cer tain states, organized violence had become the absolute
monopoly of the central political authority, which accordingly had taken all such
activity under its pur view, legally restricted its usage to the pursuit of `national'
objectives and claimed for itself the exclusive right to any material proceeds (laphyron,
leia) that might accrue therefrom: for these there was only one legitimate `booty
seizurer' ± the state ± and one field furnishing a justifiable cause for per forming that
role ± that of the political. Within such a system no room was allowed for either the
private entrepreneur or his main motive, economic gain. Both were therefore expelled
from the area of the legitimate chiefly because their ver y existence was irreconcilable
with the monopolistic claim to power by the central political authority. Heading the
list of states adhering to this organization are of course the entire group of naval
protectors and par ticularly the major Hellenistic monarchies: total personal command
over vast and highly ef fective militar y machines ceaselessly kept busy in war fare was
the life-line of the Hellenistic kings, constitutionally as well as economically (Austin
1986).
By contrast, the central political authority of the Illyrians, the Aitolians, the Cretan
city-states and other communities was willing to share the right to exercise violence
with the private entrepreneur, whether a native citizen or a foreigner in need of an
operational base in which his trade remained legally undisputed. Ultimately, there
fore, it was neither political oppression nor pover ty that created the predator. Indeed,
historically he had been there all along and continued to enjoy a thriving existence.
What did mark a significant turning point, however, was the emergence of the non
legitimate variant (`pirate', `brigand') right after the adoption of monopolistic vio
lence systems by states which eventually proved successful (because power ful enough)
Piracy and the Slave-Trade 403



at usurping the concept of `legitimacy'. Moral castigation and political marginaliza
tion of their competitor was only a natural sequel. Still, from the perspective of all
those unfor tunate enough to have for feited their freedom, such distinctions might
have seemed largely immaterial: it would have brought little comfor t to captives
waiting to be ransomed or sold as slaves to know that the `man-hunter' in to whose
hands they had fallen was of the licit rather than of the illicit variety.
FURTHER READING
An updated, chronologically organized and lucid account of ancient piracy that
challenges previous views on several points is de Souza 1999. Its predecessor,
Ormerod 1924, often employs comparative material to present some interesting
views and can still be consulted with profit. A good many of the sources for Hellenis
tic piracy are cited in the notes of Rostovtzef f 1941 III (cf. index s.v.), which assesses
the general impact of piracy on the Hellenistic world. Much fuller is the catalogue of
sources on piracy and raids, including raids in reprisal, in Pritchett 1991b: 312±63.
Several works cover par ticular areas: Dell 1967 (Illyria), Benecke 1934 (Aitolia),
Avidov 1997 and Rauh 1998 (diverging views on the Cilicians); Br ul Âe 1978
(Crete) stands out as a well-documented study demonstrating attentiveness to the
need to see piracy within a broader historical perspective. Fr uitful and insightful
analyses of the social and economic ramifications of the phenomenon at large are
of fered by Garlan 1978, 1989, esp. chapter 8, and Davies 1984. Bravo 1980, even
though less easily accessible, contains interesting interpretations, of which those
relating to the Greek vocabular y for the violent seizure of persons and goods have
been contested, cf. Pritchett 1991b: 68±152. On the Black Sea slave trade: Finley

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
Hellenistic Religion
David Potter
1 Religion
In thinking about the subject of `Hellenistic' religion two problems are immediately
obvious, the first being the parameters allowed to the concept of religion, the second
being whether or not the adjective makes any sense in conjunction with the noun. In
the first case, I will argue that the subject must be permitted to encompass a ver y
broad range of human behaviours conditioned by the belief that power ful divinities
controlled ever y feature of human existence from the moment of conception to the
moment of death and beyond. These behaviours include, but are not restricted to, the
actions associated with the formal worship of the gods. In recent years impor tant
work on other religious systems has called into question the distinction that has often
been employed since the Reformation to distinguish between `true' and `false'
worship, or between `religion' and `magic'. The thrust of this work has been to
show that forms of behaviour that have been relegated to the categor y of `magic' are
better seen as alternative forms of religious behaviour. I think that this view is the
correct one, and I have argued elsewhere that a distinction may usefully be drawn
between `active' and `passive' forms of religious behaviour (Potter 1994). By `active' I
mean behaviours that seek new knowledge of the divine world, or to control divine
action. By `passive' I mean behaviours sanctioned by tradition that seek to describe
the relationship between the mor tals and divinities. These actions are `passive'
because they imply an acceptance of existing guidelines. The two modes of religious
behaviour are complementar y as discoveries made through `active' investigation ser ve
to reform, reshape and update traditional behaviours, enabling a religious system to
progress as the culture that suppor ts it progresses. So crucial is the interaction
between `active' and `passive' behaviours that ways of seeking new information
were an integral par t of sacrifice, the central act of Greek cult. The gods were thought
to have decreed the form of sacrifice, were invited to par ticipate in the sacrificial meal,
and to indicate their approval or disapproval of the person offering the sacrifice.
The question whether or not the adjective `Hellenistic' can properly be
transferred from the context of political histor y to that of religion has recently



become problematic. Impor tant work on the cult system of Athens in par ticular has
drawn attention to large areas of continuity, making it hard to isolate elements of
religious behaviour that are genuinely new in this period (Mikalson 1998: 315±23;
Parker 1996: 256). This is quite correct, but, as I will suggest, concentration on civic
cult in the traditional Greek homeland tells only one par t of the stor y. The central
questions facing the study of Hellenistic religion must then be linked with the
broader evolution of societies between the death of Alexander and the rise of both
the Roman and Par thian states. One of these must be whether or not the changed
horizons of the Greek world altered the way that people saw their relationship with
the divine, or whether what appears perhaps most strikingly new (the use of cultic
formulae to honour living people) can be linked primarily or solely to behaviours that
were already current within the pre-existing polis structure. A second question is
whether the emergence of supra-regional Greek states ef fected the practice of cult
in the individual cities of the Aegean homeland in other ways, and, if so, to what
degree? Finally, there is the question of the relationship between thepolis religion of
the Greek Aegean and the religious systems of the Near East. Should the redefinition
of the relationship between the Mesopotamian world and Mediterranean world that
is characteristic of the political histor y of this period be reasonably allowed some role
in conditioning attitudes towards the divine? Perhaps the most significant feature of
this period is the interaction between points of continuity and areas where new forms
of conduct evolved, or, to return to my earlier point, the interaction between `active'
and `passive' aspects of religion that resulted from the transformation of the power
structure of the vastly expanded Greek world.
2 Continuity
The main form of political organization among the Greeks at the end of the period
under consideration was, as it had been for the previous four hundred years, thepolis.
Within the polis the basic structures of religious organization and theor y remained
largely unchanged: prices at which priesthoods were sold might var y, but priesthoods
were still sold to the highest bidder in the majority of Greek cities. Priests still ser ved
male divinities, and priestesses were usually charged with the oversight of female
divinities. Where this division by gender was not obser ved it was usually a sign that
the cult in question was of non-Greek origin. With regard to the cults celebrated in
each polis, the issue of ritual purity was of the foremost impor tance. Only a person
who was hagnos (pure) could approach the gods.
The requirement that a person be ritually pure in order to address the divinities is
significant in a number of ways (Parker 1983: 144±50). On a ver y basic level, it helps
explain the emphasis on physical action in laws governing cult activity, including the
terms under which a person who was not hagnos could become so. Thus in a law
concerning who might make a sacrifice from the city of Metropolis in Ionia it is stated
that: `He will be hagnos twelve days after the death of a kinsman, two days after having
had sex with his wife, three days after having had sex with a prostitute' (LSAM 29). In
a law from Maionia, datable to 147±6 B C , it is stated that: `he will be hagnos on the
fifth day after the death of a kinsman of his own blood, of another on the third day,
after sex with his wife he may enter on the same day having been cleansed in the
designated place in the Metroon; after sex with a prostitute he may be cleansed in
408 David Potter



the same way on the third day' (LSAM 18, cf. 12 from Pergamon). The terms of these
laws, which are ubiquitous from the end of the sixth centur y B C well into the years of
Roman domination, reflect a fundamental division between the human and divine
spheres. The ease with which ever yday acts of purification can be per formed reflects a
sense that fundamental aspects of the human life cycle result in pollution (miasma).
This in turn reflects a view that the world is an essential source of corruption, while
the realm of the gods is seen as being pure. If one wished to contact the gods in their
hieron, the ear thly sanctuar y that was devoted to their use and thus infused with the
awe that one should feel when approaching the divine, one had to attempt to remove
impurity from oneself. To do other wise would be to injure the gods. If the gods were
injured, they would take vengeance upon the mor tal who offended them (Parker
1983: 145±6). That person would become `accursed' ± enages. The negative defin
ition of persons who were not hagnos reflects a sense of the human propensity to fall
away from the condition in which they might rightfully contact the gods. It may also
be connected with the Greek sense of the gods as anthropomorphic being ± as the
bodies of the gods were pure, the bodies of humans were not, a reflection of the
`necessar y tension between the darkness in which the visible human body is steeped
and the radiant light with which the god's body shines' (Vernant 1991: 49).
While the Greeks often used myth to explain why a god was worshipped, the
governing body of each cult made the rules for their own cult. Myths might be
invented, remembered or adapted to explain why a cult worked in a cer tain way but
there was no direct link between the universalizing texts of the archaic period such as
Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days, or the Homeric cycle, and individual Greek
cults. Indeed, the practice may be seen as being akin to the terms of the laws quoted
above: while they all agree that sex or contact with death brings pollution they all
dif fer somewhat in describing the way that the pollution needed to be removed.
These differences did not occur on a simple polis-to-polis basis, but within a polis on a
cult-by-cult basis. Thus a law from Pergamon (albeit of the third centur y A D , but
using language that is fundamentally the same as the texts just quoted) states that
a man who wished to sleep in the temple of the god Asklepios had to abstain from
sex with his wife for ten days (LSAM 14.1±2). It may be that as sleeping in the
temple involved closer contact with the god, so the level of purification had to be
greater.
Pollution was not ordinarily, in and of itself, seen as a moral fault. The closest that
Greek thought came to a sense that moral turpitude should keep a person from
approaching the god appears in some texts that state that a person must approach
with a pure mind as well as a pure body, but this too leaves it up to the individual to
ensure that he or she is doing the right thing (Chaniotis 1997b). It is only a crime if
one does not, and the categor y of crime is separate from that of simple pollution. The
same law from Pergamon includes a second categor y of persons `who wish to be freed
from a crime (ponos)' (LSAM 14.3±4; cf. SEG 9.347). Miasma that arose from
physical acts of violence was entirely a dif ferent matter, though again it is linked
with the notion of touching something that was impure. In the case of murder, the
blood of the victim was thought to cling to the hand of the murderer, who had to be
excluded from all contact with society. The presence of such a person in a city
threatened all who lived there as it was thought that the spirit of the victim or of
avenging deities could affect all who came into contact with the killer (Parker 1983:
Hellenistic Religion 409



104±6; 126±30). In the end, of course, the gods would exact their revenge, but it was
best if humans could speed the process up. The notion that divine revenge could
af fect a large number of people was deeply imbued in the Greek consciousness, for no
person could be innocent if that person did not take a proactive role in stamping out
pollution. So too did the notion that the gods were ultimately involved in avenging
crimes. A human could evade civic justice systems if he or she sought protection from
a god, the situation envisioned in clauses of sacred laws such as that from Pergamon.
A criminal could approach the God as a suppliant, hiketes, and obtain purification for
his or her crime. The temples of the gods were places where the agents of human
justice could not penetrate, all of them having some area surrounding the altar that
had asylia, or sanctuar y. The hiketes remained within the temple until he or she
received the desired purification.
The connection between city and divinity was demonstrated by civic ef forts to
eliminate sources of pollution, and, in a more positive way, by annual festivals to the
gods, and the dedication of things that were precious to a divinity, making the temple
a reser ve treasur y for the city, as befitted the house of a wealthy resident. Most
crucially, the link between the god and the civic order was represented by the fact
that a priest or priestess of a divinity was a civic of ficial. Priesthoods ser ved to link
secular society to the shrines of the gods within the city. As we have seen, the land that
was attached to a shrine belonged to the god. The priest or priestess did not; they
were holders of positions that, in the case of civic cults, belonged to the city. As a
city's representative to a shrine, a priest or priestess was obviously an impor tant
person, but they were not `religious leaders' in anything like the modern sense of
the word: they did not propound doctrines about the gods as a result of their holding
of fice, they did not `preach the gospel' of their god, and they did not set the rules of
engagement between the community and the divinity. They were there to make sure
that the rules were enforced and to manage the bureaucratic aspects of the cult:
somebody had to organize annual festivals, make sure the shrine was in good order
and so forth. The rewards for this ser vice could include civic benefits such as front
seats at the theatre, the right to wear special clothes, free lunch, and a fee for each
sacrifice that could be paid in money, meat or other animal par ts (LSAM 12.14; 24).
A text from around the end of the four th centur y from Miletos of fers a good idea of
just what was involved:
He will take the skins and the other prerequisites; if one animal is sacrificed he will take
the tongue, the loin with meat on it and the o Ãre Ã; if more than one animal is sacrificed, he
will take a loin with meat on it from each animal, the tongue and one thigh bone with
flesh on it from the lot, and the priest who ser ves all of the other gods in thetemenos will
take the same prerequisites and the thigh with meat on it in place of theo Ãre Ã if the basileus
should not take it; if the polis should sacrifice a victim whose skin is singed, he will take
the tongue, the loin with meat on it, and the o Ãre Ã. If some foreigner should wish to make a
sacrifice to Apollo, whichever citizen the foreigner should choose will give all of the
prerequisites which the city would give except for the skin; if any foreigner should wish
to make a sacrifice at the Apollonia . . . (LSAM 46)
Aside from the fact that no one is quite sure now what is meant by the o Ãre Ã, the
organization here is reasonably straightfor ward. First and foremost it is clear that the
animals sacrificed in this cult are large, and that the god shared space in his precinct
410 David Potter



(the temenos) with other gods who had a single priest to look after their af fairs. This
priest had a claim to meat if multiple of ferings were made to the principal divinity,
perhaps a recognition that he could expect less business and thus needed to share in
that of the chief god to make his priesthood wor thwhile. It appears that another
priest, the basileus, also had some claim to the animals (the reason why is obscure).
Direct approach to the god here seems to have been limited to citizens, a feature that
is not without parallel in the case of impor tant cults elsewhere (SIG 3 548.10). The
multiple claims to par ts of a sacrificial animal suggest that this was indeed seen as a
significant benefit of office. In other texts it appears that the priest was not expected
to be present ever y time that a sacrifice was made and that the sacrificer was supposed
to leave the appropriate por tion of the animal on a table where the priest could collect
it. Another text from Miletos suggests that people were not always as scrupulous in
the obser vance of this rule as they might be: a person who had failed to leave the
por tion of the offering due to the priestess of Ar temis would be enrolled amongst the
civic debtors and banned from par ticipation in public life until appropriate recom
pense was made (LSAM 45).
Perhaps the most significant feature of the Miletos text is the fact that the penalties
are civil. The city debt collector is the person who will collect from the defaulter; it is
the civic authority that bans the defaulting sacrificer from public af fairs. The sacrificer
incurred no stain of miasma for the failure to pay the priest. This is the clearest
possible indication that an of fence against the person or income of a priest was not a
de facto religious of fence. The god had nothing to do with the choice of the priest/
priestess. Increasingly, priesthoods were sold to the highest bidder, and the sums
realized by the polis for the sale of multiple priesthoods could be substantial, leading,
in some cases, to a secondar y market in priesthoods as a person who had purchased a
priesthood for life might transfer it to another (for a fee). A fascinating text from
Er ythrai, dating to the first par t of the third centur y B C , gives a list of priests (always
listed with an eggue Ãte Ãs or guarantor), annual prices for priesthoods, and sales on the
secondar y market, which included a transfer tax to the city (LSAM 25). If a human
could not be found to hold a priesthood, it was possible through a legal fiction to
transfer the priesthood to the god or goddess herself. Under these circumstances it
appears that the money spent by the god to hold the priesthood was treated as a loan
from the god's treasur y to the city, which would have to be repaid.
A vast conceptual space separated the practices connected with ritual impurity,
which assumed an extraordinarily activist posture by the divinity, and the priesthood
that ser ved to manage the civic af fairs of a divinity. The mundane af fairs of priests
should not obscure the fact that the temple was still sacred, hieros, and the belief that
the divinity could be physically present in the shrine. A shrine was both a civic
monument, celebrating the polis' association with the divinity, and a direct link with
the divine plane. The negotiation of the space between the human and divine was not
something that could be left to priests. This space was filled instead by a wide range of
professionals whose speciality was either sacred law or direct communication with the
divinity.
As agents of passive religion, Greek priests were not empowered to decide either
what gods were to be worshipped in a polis context, or how they were to be
worshipped. Their positions depended on decisions taken elsewhere. It was a god
or goddess who decided to reside in a hieron, and it was a divinity who told humans
Hellenistic Religion 411



how the cult should work. The perceived role of the gods in this way is so central to
Greek religion that, while it is possible to rationalize all of this into a series of human
decisions, it would be wrong to do so. As we have seen, the fundamental world-view
that informed the structure of polis cult assumed that the gods were dif ferent from
mor tals. While humans might question the validity of individual cult practices within
a polis, there were ver y few, if any, genuine agnostics in the Greek world. People knew
that the gods were in contact with them because the gods spoke to them, and told
them how they were to be worshipped. A text that has recently come to light from
Kallatis contains a list of gods who are worshipped in the city and a collection of
Delphic oracles listing gods who ought to be celebrated (SEG 45.911±13). It was also
typical for an oracle establishing a new cult to decree who should par ticipate, what
should be sacrificed and how. In the light of the content of these oracles, it is likely,
though this cannot be proved on the basis of the texts themselves, that the por tions of
sacred laws that are connected with ritual purity and par ticipation go back to an oracle
that had approved their content. If an oracle was not involved in the establishment of
a cult, it was typical for there to be some other form of direct divine action. Thus the
Sotereia that was instituted at Delphi after the repulse of the Gauls in 278 is explicitly
connected with the epiphany of the god during the battle, and the new festival of
Ar temis Leukophr yene at Magnesia on the Maeander is said to have been the result of
an epiphany of the goddess (I.Magn. 16; Nachtergael 1977: 25, 163±4). So too the
cult of Sarapis was reshaped into a `national' cult under the Ptolemies as the result of a
vision of Ptolemy I, and the shrine of Sarapis at Delphi includes a text describing
the vision of Sarapis to the founder of that shrine (Nock 1930: 50±4; Fraser 1972:
I.267±8; Dunand 1973: 45±66). At Epidauros and other shrines, the miraculous
cures of Asklepios proved to all who went to the temple and read the record of the
god's mercy what he could do (Edelstein 1945). The sudden upsurge in the inscrip
tion of these stories in the third centur y is perhaps a response to the public stress on
the manifestation of divine action in other quar ters.
In the course of celebrating the gods, the moment of sacrifice was a critical point
where the active and passive intersected. The mode of sacrifice, the date upon which it
was of fered, if of fered by the city, and, indeed, the decision by an individual to of fer
the sacrifice are all elements of passive religion in that they depend upon the existing
expectation that contact with the god will be made in a cer tain way at a cer tain time.
Par ticipation in the sacrifice also varied depending upon who of fered it ± a civic
sacrifice could ver y well involve the par ticipation of the whole community, which
might then share in a banquet. A private sacrifice would plainly involve only those
persons whom the sacrificer deemed necessar y. The presence of priests was always
necessar y at a public sacrifice, but not at a private one ± a further sign of the priest's
role as a representative of the community to the god rather than of the god to the
community.
The moment of sacrifice, however, injected an element of the active; for the god
was, in theor y, invited to par ticipate in the sacrifice, and the sacrificer attached great
impor tance to signs that the god had accepted the sacrifice. The course of the
sacrificial ceremony was centred on the decisive moment when the god's presence
would be manifest. Thus it began with a procession in which the sacrificial animal was
led to the altar, and when it arrived, the par ticipants stood in a circle, washing their
hands with lustral water and taking a handful of grain (Burkert 1985: 55±7; Vernant
412 David Potter



1991: 290±302). Once the humans were prepared, water was sprinkled on the head
of the animal so that it would nod in agreement to its fate. In the case of an animal
with hair (we do not know what happened in the case of birds or fish) a lock was then
cut from its forehead to be thrown onto the fire that was burning on the altar. The
chief sacrificer then uttered a prayer to the god, and those who were also par ticipants
threw their handfuls of barley onto the fire. The sacrificer then cut the animal's throat
(larger animals were stunned first) and women who accompanied the procession let
out a cr y (the ololyge Ã). The animal was then butchered, with the god's por tion being
placed on the altar, and the priest's prerequisites left on a table nearby (or placed on
the image of the god). Ever y stage of the operation was watched closely for signs of
divine approval: if there was trouble with the sacrificial animal, it was a bad sign; if the
fire did not flare up when the god's por tion consisting of fat and bones was placed
upon it, that was also a bad sign. If some fault appeared within the animal after it was
sacrificed, that too was a bad sign. On the other hand, if all went well, the sacrificer
could then turn to the fur ther butcher y of the animal and the preparation of the feast
for those who had par ticipated. The symbolic ordering of events makes the meaning
of the ceremony ver y clear: the god comes first, if the human has succeeded in making
positive contact with the god, then the human may par ticipate in a meal that the
divinity has agreed to join. If not, it was up to the human to figure out what went
wrong, and, quite possibly to do so by asking a god what the problem was with the
aid of a professional consultant.
Professional consultants came, broadly speaking, in two varieties: those who spe
cialized in deductive prognostication on the basis of signs, and those who were
divinely inspired. In general terms, words for inspired prophets involved compounds
of words for speech ± prophetes, thespiodos, chresmologos ± while those for other
specialists involved compounds derived from their method of divination: anoinopolos
sought meaning from the flight of birds, an astrologos from the movement of the stars
and so for th. The significant exception to this general tendency is the word mantis,
connected with mainomai, to rant or rage. Even in the classical period, the word was
used loosely to designate any exper t, despite what would appear to be an original
derivation from the practice of inspired prophecy: the mantis raged because he could
not control the god who spoke through him (Burkert 1985: 112±13). In some cases
their function appears to have been to suggest sacrifices that would yield accurate
results, giving the mantis a reasonable claim to have of fered material assistance in
winning a battle. Others seem to have been less skilled and functioned simply to
interpret omens for which they could take no par ticular credit. Cer tainly when a city
needed advice, standard practice appears to have been to approach an oracle rather
than a local specialist. The prophets at oracles were evidently felt to be in closer touch
with the divine than others.
The range of professionals was vast, ranging from people who had their own
predictive methods, such as interpreting cheeses, to those who were specialists in
the wisdom that appeared in books of prophecy that were the professed work of
prophets who had lived in the distant past (Potter 1994: 10±11). The practice
of these people, ordinarily referred to as chresmologoi, was widespread as early as the
sixth centur y, and their impact will be felt later in this chapter when we turn to
the question of discourse between Greek and non-Greek modes of religious thought
(section 5).

3 Polis Cult and Polis Dignity
The connection between cult and civic life made it inevitable that a city should
attempt to promote its own cults as a form of civic aggrandizement. This was
anything but new in the centuries after Alexander, as the histor y of Delphi or
Olympia, Dodona or Delos in the classical period (or before) make abundantly
clear. The Athenian use of the cult of Athena in the period of its fifth centur y empire
was more aggressive than anything attempted by the supra-regional kingdoms after
Alexander, and for obvious reasons. While the Seleukids could make much of their
devotion to Apollo, or the Ptolemies of their links to Herakles and Zeus, they were
per force referring to the generalized Olympian divinity rather than any individual city
cult. The one exception to this rule (which may prove the point) is the close
association between the Attalids and the cult of Zeus at Pergamon, for, unlike the
other Hellenistic monarchies they star ted from a polis base rather than a base provided
by the Macedonian people in arms, and they never asser ted a desire for control of `the
whole'. The fact that monarchs might patronize polis cults as a way of demonstrating
their good qualities might have had the collateral ef fect of encouraging new forms of
expression through which cities could asser t their own impor tance through the
promotion of their own cults.
The development of the right of asylum is one of these significant changes in civic
practice during the Hellenistic period, and while it was by no means universal, it was
widespread enough to be seen as a characteristic of the period (Rigsby 1996: 4±6).
This change did not involve the abandonment of earlier practices, but rather the
addition of a new practice.
It appears that the request for such rights did not emerge directly from temples
(whose gods could look after their own interests). Rather it stemmed from a complex
of factors, not the least of them being the repulse of the Gauls from Delphi, and the
recollection of a tradition of panhellenic success against barbarian foes (Rigsby 1996:
26±7). Prior to the middle of the third centur y, the only place in the Greek world that
had been recognized in historical time as permanently `sacred and inviolable' was
Plataia. The repulse of the Gauls was presented to the world as an event of similar
magnitude to the defeat of the Persians, the language with which it was described
evoked the events of 480/79 and a suitable miracle was repor ted (Nachtergael 1977:
1, 21±5; Mitchell, this volume). What is more, and this point while not made directly
by anyone would perhaps have been clear to ever yone, it was a victor y won by Greek
poleis without the aid of a king.
The temple of Athena Itonia at Koroneia in Boiotia, the federal shrine of
the Boiotian league, is the first temple that we know to have been the object of a
decree of inviolability. Like Delphi, the shrine had historic significance, but in this
case the decree may have been motivated by an actual desire to protect a place that
might be threatened in the course of the Chremonidean war that was raging between
the Antigonids of Macedon and an alliance of Greek states led by Athens and Spar ta
(Rigsby 1996: no. 1; Scholten 2000: 70, 75±7). Although this move may be associ
ated with an ef for t by states in mainland Greece to asser t their independence, the
sudden reasser tion of royal power after the Antigonid victor y may have suggested
that ef for ts at civic asser tion move into a dif ferent context. Asser tion of a glorious
414 David Potter



past, or of miracles on another plain could of fer avenues without challenging the
power of the kings, now shown to be a fruitless activity. At the same time there seems
to have been an increase in the number of cities that were seeking panhellenic status
for themselves through the foundation of new games. Requests for the status of
`sacred and inviolable' are often found in the context of these new games ± as are
requests for other forms of civic embellishment. Thus on an inscription from Leba
deia we find that:
Kalliklidas the Lokrian from Opous, having gone down to the oracle of Trophonios
announced that Lebadeia is to be dedicated to Zeus Basileus and Trophonios, and
Akraiphia to Apollo Ptoios, and no one is to wrong these (peoples). They are both to
collect sacred funds, for the common good, in ever y land, and proclaim the holy contest.
Whoever repairs the temple of Zeus Basileus will wear the crown. (Rigsby 1996: no. 2,
trans. slightly altered)
It would, perhaps, be easy to read this text as a sign that divine cult had become a
ritualized farce in the struggle for civic improvement. So too might it be possible to
read the decree of the people of Magnesia on the Maeander proclaiming their festival
of Ar temis Leukophr yene as a blatant attempt to gain status on the basis of claims
about a divine apparition (Rigsby 1996: no. 66). Likewise, in reading replies such as
those of Ptolemy to the people of Kos as a publicity stunt motivated by the desire to
be seen to be as reasonable as others; for he states that the fact that others have
recognized their festival in honour of Asklepios is a factor in motivating his accept
ance (Rigsby 1996: no. 8). But in all these cases there is a consistent pattern. What is
needed, first and foremost, is a sign of divine will either in the form of a specific
inter vention, or, in other cases, because success can be attributed to the long
standing favour of the divinity who is to be celebrated. The crucial point is that a
convincing case needed to be presented that the divinity had taken the initiative.
Instead of seeing these actions as a sign that local cults had lost their meaning,
it is perhaps better to see them as reinforcing the impor tance of local cults in civic
life.
A phenomenon that runs parallel to the search for asylum is the use of `histor y'
(usually mythological) to negotiate with other states. In this case, of course, there was
a long tradition of mythological diplomacy and the creation of fictive kinship in
Greek histor y (Cur ty 1995; C. Jones 1999b; Erskine 2001; 2002b). But that does
not make the phenomenon, which increased dramatically in the centuries after
Alexander, any less significant. The stories of gods and heroes provided the ideo
logical glue that held the Greek world together. While not, strictly speaking, reli
gious, neither is this form of discourse, strictly speaking, secular. It represents the
close linkage of local cult and local identity. The use of stories about gods and heroes
as `ice-breakers' between two states is ver y similar to the use of miracle stories to
justify claims for `sacred and inviolable' status. Although in the modern world these
accounts may be viewed as `constructed histor y', there is no proof that they were
conceived of this way in the ancient (C. Jones 1999b: 132±3). In a sense the
discourse of miracle and myth contextualized current concerns within a greater
world histor y.

4 Cult for Humans
One aspect of the discourse of myth and miracle was the fact that mor tals had become
gods in the Greek tradition long before the time of Alexander. So too temples were
repositories of items that were of impor tance to a city. The two traditions are of equal
impor tance in explaining how it was that there was a rapid increase in the number of
people who received divine honours after the death of Alexander. This is a phenom
enon that, strictly speaking should not be referred to as ruler cult (hence the title for
this section). As we shall see, people who were never in a position to claim the title of
basileus received such honours, and the practice of granting such honours to kings
emerges from a context in which individuals of all sorts were acquiring honours in a
divine context. The dividing line between the placement of an image of a human
being in a temple and celebrating a festival in honour of a person whose image has
been erected in a temple is not nearly as vast as the gulf between human and divine.
What it reflects is a melding of civic interest and divine location in a new way rather
than an altogether new phenomenon.
The crucial point for understanding the development of divine cult for humans is
that by the second half of the four th centur y it was not unusual for honours that a city
had voted to an individual to be inscribed on a stele that was placed within a temple
precinct. Thus at some point between 334 and 332 the people of Delphi ordered that
a decree for the historian Kallisthenes and the philosopher Aristotle be placed in the
temple of Apollo at Delphi (SIG
3 275). In 333 the people of Priene ordered that a
statue of Mexyboxos the Ephesian be placed in their temple of Athena (SIG
3 282). In
334 the people of Er ythrai ordered that stele commemorating the actions of their
citizen Phanes, who had played a role in expelling the Persians from the city, be placed
in the temples of Athena and Herakles, and in 332/1 the Athenians ordered that a
stone stele honouring the historian Phanodemos for his ser vice to Amphiareus
be placed in the temple itself (SIG
3 285, 287). In 328/7 they ordered similar
honours for Androkles, the priest of Asklepios, in the temple of the god he had
ser ved (IG 22 352). At Samos the citizens of the restored polis honoured a cer tain
Gorgo, who had played some role in negotiating the removal of the Athenian colony
with Alexander, and inscribed the decree on a stele that was erected in the temple of
Hera (SIG
3 312). The Athenians had not left peacefully after Alexander's decree, and
had arrested a group of Samians that had attempted to return, transpor ting them to
Athens where they were sentenced to death. A man named Antileon, from Chalkis on
Euboia, inter vened to save them from their fate. In his case the Samians voted that
Antileon should receive `a statue] of bronze in the temple [of Hera' as well as a variety
of other honours (Habicht, MDAI(A) (1957) no. 1).
The practice of dedicating statues or other images in temples for individuals who
had merely spent a great deal of money or time on some temple or other civic matter
raised the question of what to do for someone whose ability to act went far beyond
that of the ordinar y civic benefactor (Nock 1930: 61; Habicht 1970: 163±4)? The
fusion of honours in the civic context brings out `the ease with which an ancient could
put what we call human honours and what we should call divine honours on a level
without any inevitable mental confusion between the objects of each or the categories
to which those objects belonged' (Nock 1930: 51). As we have seen, it was the city
416 David Potter



that deter mined what god s sh ould be worshippe d and how ± the honours wer e the
city's to best ow .
It was on Samos, in the wake of L ysandros ' defea t o f Athens , that cult honours
were firs t of fered to a living man ± L ysandros ' resto ration of Samos we nt far beyond
what any ordinar y bene factor could of fer, so it may have made sens e to honour him in
a way that no othe r man was honoure d. So too at Syrac use in 357, the re is evi dence
that an altar was erecte d in honour of Dion after he had ende d the tyranny . There is
no need to thin k that this decisio n was taken because of what the Sam ians had don e
earlier ± L ysandros had, after all, come to a bad end ± ra ther it is like ly that the
Syrac usans were indepe ndently motivated by the same log ic. He had done someth ing
extrao rdinar y , and so deser ved an extrao rdinar y honour . In Macedonia a cult appe ars
to have been esta blished for Amynta s, possibly in his own lifetime, at Pydna, and the
same was alm ost cer tainly done for Phi lip at A mphipol is. Som ewhat late r, as his
ar mies march ed through weste r n A sia Mino r, taking advant age of under-pre pared
Persian defen ces, Philip recei ved divi ne hono urs at Ere sos and Ephe sos. Philip himself
appear s to have taken all this one step fur ther when he appe ared as the thir teent h god
in a process ion at Pella on the last day of his life. He was, after all, a bene factor to the
Greek world (at least in his eyes, an d those o f his suppor ters) unlike a ny other man,
and so he inte grated himself into a local for m of celeb ration in his capital. Given the
honours for Philip, it is scarcely surprisi ng that Alexande r first receive d cult from the
cities of A sia Minor, and then, it appe ars, promoted sugge stions of his own divinity
after his visit to Siwa (Habich t 1970 : 3±36; Chaniot is, this volum e).
Despit e the spec ial claims that they may both have had and sought to promot e,
Philip and Alexand er did not remove divine honours from a civi c context. Two
decre es are of great sign ificance for underst anding the spread o f divi ne honours for
mor tals af ter the death of Alexande r . The firs t of these decre es con cer ns a man named
Thersipp os in the smal l island
polis of Nesos, who obta ined sign ificant influe nce with
variou s Mace donian general s after Alexande r's deat h. Here the stat ement with regard
to divi ne honours is explicit, for the peop le `will crown him on thre e successiv e days
and of fer a
euaggelia and a
so Ãte Ãria and a
panagyris at pub lic exp ense' (
OGIS 4.41 ±3).
The second, know n only through a much late r honorific decree from Kolop hon,
refers to a temple called the Pre pelaio n. The Prep elaion hono ured a general of
L ysimachos who had ar ranged for the city to be preser ved when the king had desired
to transfe r its popul ation in its entiret y to Ephe sos (J. and L. Robe r t 1989: 77±85).
Cult to benefacto rs, either as individual s or as a grou p cont inued for the next
several centurie s (Robe r t 19 26: 499±500 ; S. Pric e 1984: 47±9). Thus in 117 a decre e
of the Mace donian city of Letai in honou r of a Roman quaest or named Marcus
Annius stat es that the citizens will establish `a cont est invol ving horse races in his
honour each yea r in the month of Daisio s when they celebr ate the co ntests in honour
of the othe r benefa ctors' (
SIG 3 700. 38±40). At Athe ns the epheb es were charg ed in
the late second centur y with of fering `the esta blishe d sacr ifices to the gods and the
benef actors' and the gymn asiarch at Pergamo n was ordere d to `make the prope r
sacrifice s to the gods in the gymn asium and to the benefac tors' (
IG 2
2
1006. 15±16;
MDAI (A) (19 10) no. 410. 10). The language used in these and other cases reveals
that the cult of the bene factors was closely linked with othe r celebrat ions of the past.
Thus in addit ion to par ticipa ting in festi vals such as the Diony sia and the Eleusini an
Hellenistic Religion 417



mysteries, the Athenian ephebes would appear at sacrifices at the Aianteia on Salamis,
make an of fering to Zeus Tropaios, of fer sacrifice at the public tomb at Marathon,
and appear in the procession of Artemis Agrotera, all festivals connected with the
Persian wars of the fifth centur y. Likewise they would go and `enquire about the
proprietar y rights of Athens at the Amphiaraion', acquired in 287, as a way of
asser ting Athenian ownership (Mikalson 1998: 248±9). Benefactors and old battles
were par t and parcel of the civic tradition.
Similar to the cult of benefactors who were alive was the establishment of hero cults
to those who had died. The categor y of hero or `demi-god', a categor y that occupied
an area between the mor tal and divine realms, was a peculiarly Greek institution. In
outward form it involved the creation of a special grave, a heroon, that was separated
from other graves, the offering of regular sacrifice and votive gifts and, sometimes, a
spectacular monument. The rites with which heroes were celebrated were, to some
degree, a `chthonic counterpar t' to the rites with which the gods were celebrated ±
involving blood sacrifice, offerings of food and libations (Burkert 1985: 203±6). Some
sites appear to have made provision for bathing and lamentation for the dead hero
appears to have been routine. The sacrifice was always accompanied by a banquet at
which the hero was thought to be present, and, in some cases, by a festival that was
equal to that offered to a god. In other cases the celebration was less spectacular, and
the accomplishment that qualified a person for heroic status was allegedly no more than
having died ± `why don't you hang yourself and become a hero in Thebes' appears in an
Attic comedy and might be best rendered in English as `drop dead' (Fraser 1977: 78).
One of the crucial aspects of the hero or heroine was that he/she only lived once
and thus could only have one true resting place. This led to a significant connection
between hero cult and community identity. If all places might have a Zeus, only one
place could be the resting-place of Achilles' son, Pyrrhos, whose tomb was at Delphi.
The connection between community histor y and hero cult would appear to go back
to the formative period of the practice (probably the eighth centur y) and it may be no
accident that it was connected with the epic cycle as a feature of the archaic reification
of tradition. In some cases actual sites were connected with the Mycenean past ± the
graves of the Hyperborean maidens on Delos are the remains of Mycenean tombs ±
and it may be that the epic tradition itself helped shape this form of commemoration.
As the epic cycle gave shape to Greek notions of their past, hero cult enabled Greeks
of later generations to lay claim to a piece of that tradition. Hero cult plainly had a
strong political aspect from the sixth centur y onwards when Athenians laid claim to
Salamis on the basis of Homer, and Spar ta to a dominant position within the
Peloponnese on the basis of the Achaian tradition invented around the bones of
Orestes. The strength of these traditions as par t of a national myth during the
Hellenistic period may be seen, for instance, in the actions of the Athenian ephebes
described above, and their visit to a pair of hero shrines ± those of Ajax and
Amphiareus ± in the course of their annual peregrinations and their par ticipation in
the Theseia, the festival celebrating the role of Theseus in the foundation of the Attic
state. As historical figures, heroes were no more figures of the distant past than were
other benefactors, and the tradition of celebrating benefactors as heroes is impor tant
as a later development in the cult of benefactors. It was a basic premise of benefactor
cult that the benefactor who received the honours was still alive, while it was a basic
premise of hero cult that the honorand was deceased.
418 David Potter



Benefactor cult, and the extension of benefactor cult to hero cult, may be seen as
logical developments of existing polis institutions, and extensions that might have
taken place even if Philip or Alexander had never lived ± cult had, after all, been
of fered to L ysandros in the wake of his destruction of Athenian power in 404. In a
sense it is impor tant to keep benefactor cult within the civic context separate from
ruler cult, an extension of benefactor cult that moved in a wholly new direction, and
the subject of next chapter of this book. For present purposes, however, it will be
suf ficient to note that one of the truly interesting features of this phenomenon was
the way that it facilitated the redefinition of Greek traditions within native contexts in
the realm of the Ptolemies, where it developed. What evolved in Egypt was a
combination of elements derived from benefactor cult with indigenous traditions to
create a new form of discourse that proved remarkably power ful as a political insti
tution, providing the structures upon which the later Roman imperial cult would
evolve. It also of fers a paradigm for the dif ferential integration of new religious
elements in the Greek world. Contact between Greek and non-Greek resulted in
forms of discourse that had multiple meanings depending upon the perspective of the
participant in the discourse, and it is to this broader context that we must now turn.
5 Interactions
The interchange between Greek and non-Greek traditions of religious thought is by
far the most important feature of the Hellenistic period from the perspective of the
broader histor y of religious thought. As we shall see, there was no one model that fits
all forms of contact, and one word will be avoided in the description of any of them.
This word is `syncretism', a word in that, in religious studies, describes the influence
of one religion upon another (Colpe 1987: 218±27; L. Mar tin 1987: 10±11). But the
forms of this interaction are so varied as to make the term virtually meaningless ±
instead of saying that some behaviour is the result of `syncretistic synthesis' (which
should be a tautology) or `syncretistic evolution' it is perhaps better to be content
with terms like synthesis, symbiosis, acculturation, transformation, distor tion, ab
sorption. It is perhaps more useful to examine parallelism, interaction and identifica
tion, all of which have been identified as dif ferent forms of `syncretism', in their own
right rather than as features of something else. In speaking of the evolution of ideas
about the gods, it might be better to think of confrontation or theocrasy (a rather
useful term to describe the way that cults of ver y different sorts came to resemble each
other). All of these phenomena are amply attested in the record of religious inter
action between Greek and non-Greek in the centuries after Alexander.
It is from the ver y limit of Greek rule in central Asia that some of the most
intriguing evidence for synthesis comes. The excavations at Ai Khanoum on the
Oxus in modern Afghanistan did not reveal the foundations of a Greek temple before
the political crises of recent years forced their termination. But they did reveal the
foundations of a Mesopotamian-style temple, `the temple of the niches' on the main
street of the town, containing what appears to be a colossal statue of a seated Zeus
along with a variety of other dedications (Liger and de Valence 1984: 125). An
inscription that dates to the middle of the second centur y B C reveals that the gods
of the gymnasium were still being worshipped at that point. Inscriptions from the
treasur y show officials with both Greek and Persian names working side by side in the
Hellenistic Religion 419



administ ration . T he coins of the Baktrian kings we re replete with ima ges of the god s
of the Aegean , and it appe ars that they claim ed a par ticu lar af finity to Zeus (H olt
1999: 120±1).
Plutarch claimed that the peop le of Baktria lear ned to honour the Gre ek gods af ter
Alexande r, and the evi dence cited above may be taken as prov ing his point, bu t on ly
on a most super ficial level (Mor. 328d). Thus the A r temi s who was also worshi ppe d at
Ai Khanou m, gi ving her name to the cur rent si te, seems to have been `Lady Moon ' in
the local diale ct. Her cult was as similated to that of the Mesopo tamian God dess
Anahita, and, as the mod er n tradi tion sugge sts, both divinit ies may have resonated
with the worshi p of a god dess prior to the ar rival of the Ach aimenid s. So too, while
`the temple of the niches' contains the aforem entioned stat ue of Zeus it also cont ains
an ima ge of Kybele, and num erous objects that look back beyon d the Achaim enid era
to older kingdoms such as Urar tu and A ssyria. T he best exp lanation of the misc ellany
that has emerged from the study of objec ts found in niche s ( which ha ve no parallel in
Mesopo tamian architectur e) is that they are conne cted with the worshi p of a d ivinity
or divi nities b y the indig enous peop le (Liger and de V alenc e 1984: 122±5). The
colloc ation of objec ts in the temple of the niche s, assemble d between 280 and 150, is
of par ticular inte rest as the temple appe ars to have cease d to function as a temple in
the `late period' of the habitati on of the site , the per iod af ter the end of direct Greek
contro l. T he temple 's fa te woul d seem to sugge st that it was seen a s a building
conne cted in some si gnificant way to the previous reg ime, which was evidently
loathed b y the n omadic Yue-t che who sa cked the city in 145 (Liger and le C uyot
1992: 2±3, 289±94). If that is the case, then the temple may well represen t not so
much the co existence betwe en Greek and indige nous cult s as it did the gradual ascent
of an indige nous cult so that it became a cult of the r uling power . T his in tur n may
help confir m what woul d other wise seem the obvious conclusi on to draw from an
altar dedic ated, in Gre ek, at T akht-i Sangin by a man named Atrosoke s to Oxus. In
this ca se, of cour se, we h ave a man with a Pers ian name making a dedic ation to a
central A sian god in the lang uage that he had assimilat ed from the r uling class
(Litvin sky and Pi chikyan 1981±2: 195±206 ). The te mple in which he made his
dedicati on was, like the temple of the niche s at Ai Khanou m, in the Meso potamian
style (Hanne stad and Pott s 1990: 95). The system was thus neithe r Gre ek nor tr uly
that of the original system of the indige nous peop les, but rather a blend ing of three
dif ferent syste ms: Greek, Pers ian and centra l Asian.
If, in the later period of the Baktrian king dom, local cults were becom ing sign ifi
cant fo r the r uling class, it sho uld also be noted that in the earlier period of the
kingdom , the flow of inf luence was set in the opposi te direction . The fron t of the
heroon of Kineas (probably the city founder) at Ai Khanou m was originally marked by
three columns cont aining the one hundr ed and fifty or so `Sayi ngs of the Seven
Sages', carefully cop ied b y the peripatet ic philosop her Klearc hos from Delph i and
inscribe d at what was the far thest point in the Greek worl d (Robe r t 1968a : 416±5 7;
Yailenko 199 0: 239±5 6). A bout tw enty years later, on the bor ders of the Maur yan
kingdom of Asoka, a number of pillars were erected, in a variety of lang uages, to
infor m the k ing's subjects o f his personal moral cod e (Thapar 1997: 271±82). One of
these, erecte d in the tenth yea r of h is reign, was placed in the city of Kandah ar, kno wn
to the Gre ek world as Alexandr ia in Arachos ia, inscr ibed in both Greek and Aramai c.
The Gre ek versi on reads as follows:
420 David Potter



Ten years having passed, king Piodasses ( Asoka) revealed piety to men. Thencefor th he
made men more pious and made all things prosper throughout the entire land. The king
abstained from [eating] living creatures, and [following his example] other men did
likewise, and all who were hunters or fishermen have ceased their work. Those lacking
self-control, have, as far as possible, overcome their weakness, and, unlike before, have
become obedient to their father, mother, and elders. By doing these things they will live
more profitably in the future. (trans. Thapar 1997: 260±1)
The Greek phrasing of this text reveals many close points of contact with the Delphic
maxims, and there is direct evidence for Greek philosophers who had visited the cour t
of the Maur yan kings. The Deimachos who negotiated the treaty between Seleukos I
and Asoka's father, Bindousara, appears to have been the author of a workOn Piety,
Peri Eusebeias, in Greek, but in the text presented here, the word eusebeia translates
precisely the word Dhamma (Strabo 1.10; 2.10; Yailenko 1990: 253). Whether or
not Deimachos' work was composed before, during or after his stay in the cour t
of Bindousara does not really matter, for it is clear from other evidence (the request
that Bindousara made of Antiochos I for another philosopher) that the ideas that he
espoused were, in general terms, of interest (Athen. 14.652±3). Ptolemy II was
suf ficiently aware of this to make sure that he included a philosopher in the embassy
that he sent to the same cour t. Asoka himself sought to continue the dialogue, on his
own account, by sending Brahmins to discuss matters with the Greeks. This may
reasonably be taken as an example of constructive discourse between two dif ferent
modes of thought. But does it mean that Asoka's thought was conditioned or altered
in some significant way by the encounter with Greek philosophy? The evidence can be
read in two ver y dif ferent ways. According to one reading, the verbal parallels
between Asoka's Greek text and the language of the Delphi maxims suggest that
there was a ver y real influence (Yailenko 1990). Another reading, when Asoka's
Greek text is read in the context of his other edicts, might suggest something ver y
dif ferent ± that Asoka had a scribe who was familiar with the seven sages and used the
language of that text as a guide to translating Asoka's thought into Greek (Thapar
1997: 279).
If the second view is accepted (and I think it the more likely) then there is a ver y
interesting parallelism between the Indian and Greek behaviours towards each other.
Asoka's interest in Greek philosophy may be seen as a vehicle for communication with
his subjects rather than as a profound intellectual engagement. He is using Greek to
express Indian thought. At the same time, Greeks may be seen transforming Indian
culture into something that was comprehensible to themselves. To the ver y Klearchos
who brought Delphic Maxims to Ai Khanoum are attributed two remarks of stagger
ingly blinkered religious ethnography. According to Diogenes Laer tius he declared
that the `Naked sophists' were the descendants of the magi. He also appears to have
maintained that all opinions concerning nature could be found to originate `among
philosophers outside of Greece, some amongst the Brahmins of India, others in
Syria amongst those who are called the Jews' (D.L. 1.9; Jos. Ap. 1.179; Rober t
1968a: 447). Indeed, he appears to have argued that the Jews were actually descend
ants of the Brahmins. Whatever he was actually told, Klearchos plainly only heard it
according to his own preconceived notions of the way that knowledge was transmit
ted from one culture to another. The case of Klearchos' encounter with the wise men
Hellenistic Religion 421



of the east may reasona bly be compare d with the fate of one man who did tr y to
explain an easter n religion, in its own ter ms, and in Greek.
The man in quest ion is Berossos, who was con nected in some way with the cult of
Marduk at Babylon, and who composed a histor y , probably entitled theBabyloniaka,
to demonst rate the impor tance of Babylon in the h istor y of the Near East. In this
histor y he plainly drew upon texts in his native lang uage, and he seems to have tried
to pre sent this material in a way that confor med to the tast es of his r ulers (Kuhr t
1987: 32±56). He failed, quite possibly because his version of Babyloni an histor y and
religion (including a talking Fish Man), was so completely at odds with the version of
Near Easter n histor y and religion that the people he was tr ying to educat e alr eady
knew . There was no room in the Greek version of the Near East for a Babylon that
was disti nct from Assyria and Per sia. Nor, it seems, was there room for a religious
system that did not involve the magi. Beros sos' his tor y seems to have attr acted
relatively little notice until the first centur y BC
when the historian Alexande r Polyhis
tor produced a condensed version o f it. After that it seem s to have been igno red save
by the authors of other spe cialized tracts on Babyloni an histor y and comm entators in
Greek on Hebre w scripture (Sterling 1992: 116±17).
As if to complete the act of cultur al appropriat ion, Berosso s himself was trans
for med within the Greek tradition from a real human being to an object o f fiction.
V itr uvius wrote that Berossos was the first of the Chalde ans who we re verse d in
astrology to come west, and that he settled on Kos ( FGrH 680 T5). A number of
other wester n authors cite his alleged doctrines with approv al and the Elder Pliny
even records that there was a statue of him in the gymnas ium at Athens with a golden
tongue, erected `because of his divine predictions ' ( FGrH 680 T6). The astrological
doctrines associated with his name, howeve r, are all Greek (Kuhr t 1987: 36±48). In
another tradition he becomes the fathe r o f a sibyl who was said to have lived in the
ver y earlies t period of human histor y .
Appropr iation may also result in parallel ism, or, at best, a one directional flow of
intellectual influe nce. The Seleukid s (like all Greeks) regarded indigenous temples as
sacred places. But, with the except ion of Seleukos I's patr onage of the temple of
Marduk at Babylon, the y also paid them little heed, prefer ring to found temple s to
Greek gods in the ir new cities and allowing traditional cults to continue without
inter r uption. Two site s in par ticular reveal possible models of interact ion, quite
dif ferent from each othe r, albeit contempo raneous. These are Masjid -i Solaiman
and Bard- Á e N Â echande h, both in the southeas ter n par t of Iran that had on ce com
prised the ancient king dom of Elam and the homeland of the Achaim enids, and
would, before the end of the Hellenistic per iod, house the king dom o f Elymais.
Bard- Á e N Â echande h was constr ucted in the second centur y BC
by the Elamite king
Kamniskire s I in the for m of a traditional Zoroast rian shrine with three bas ic elem
ents; a terrace that suppor ted a podium upon which sat an atestgah, the high tower
that housed, in a chamber at the top, a sacred fire. As the excavator notes, the shrine
was constr ucte d as if the Greeks had never been (Ghi rshman 1976: 2 82). Masjid-i
Solaiman, by way of contrast, shows some signs of contact with the Greek world. The
original shrine, with its terrace±podium± atestgah str ucture dates to the early Achai
menid period, and in this con text two votive objects of extreme antiqu ity have been
discovered, one being an Assyrian cylinder containing a treaty betwe en Esarhaddon
and the Medes, the othe r being a casket of Tutmoses III (Ghirshman 197 6: 67). In
422 David Potter



the course of the late third or early second centur y B C (probably) the terrace was
expanded to the nor th and west to hold two new temples, which have been identified
as being to Athena Hippia, the other to Herakles, probably dating to the reign of
Antiochos III (Ghirshman 1976: 187±91 but see caveats on the date in Hannestad
and Potts 1990: 115; Potts 1999: 371). In neither case did the temple resemble a
temple of the Aegean world, in both cases the style of construction resembles that of
the Seleukid temple at Uruk, modelled on Mesopotamian structures (Heinrich 1982;
Hannestad and Potts 1990: 107). In other words, if these are Greek cults, they are
Greek cults in thoroughly non-Greek buildings. The three temples appear to have
coexisted throughout the Seleukid period as independent entities ± a true parallelism.
The lack of local respect for the Greek tradition amongst the indigenous population
may be reflected by the fact that the temple of Athena was sacked in the course of the
Par thian conquest, and both temples were re-dedicated to Par thian divinities: Ana
hita and Verethragna (Ghirshman 1976: 282±3).
Aside from the shape of the building in which they were worshipped there is no
evidence to suggest that Persian attitudes af fected the way that the Greek colonists
viewed their gods. On the other hand, when the shrine of Herakles became unques
tionably one of Verethragna, his worshippers recognized him in an anthropomorphic
form. This was a ver y real depar ture from earlier traditions, a sign that temple
architecture can only take us so far in determining what people thought about the
gods who were worshipped within their walls. It is quite reasonable to think that
architecture was more conser vative than theology. In the realm of theology, the
anthropomorphization of Persian gods may be paralleled by at least one significant
development in Zoroastrian thought. This development is the view that histor y can
be described as a succession of kingdoms (initially four) followed by an eschatological
catastrophe. This scheme is attested in a thir teenth-centur y A D Persian manuscript,
but in such a way as to make it clear that it had entered Zoroastrian thinking in the
early Hellenistic period (Eddy 1961: 10; Boyce 1984: 68). From there it appears to
have entered Jewish thought where it is adumbrated most famously in the Book of
Daniel. In Greek thought the scheme, which has its origins in the Hesiodic myth of
ages, became so well established that uses of the pattern were not always eschato
logical. Dionysios of Halikarnassos exploited the notion as a way of praising Rome in
the preface to his Roman Antiquities, pointing out that Rome was superior to the
four previous kingdoms, and another Augustan historian, Pompeius Trogus, adopted
it to give structure to his universal histor y (J. W. Swain 1940: 16±17; Gabba 1991:
193). In the second centur y Appian used it in the preface to his collected histories of
Rome and of Rome's wars and civil wars in a way that was ver y similar to Dionysios.
The contact between Greek and Iranian, Indian and central Asian systems of
thought thus allowed for a wide range of dif ferent results, though, in the main,
Greek ideas were adapted to indigenous systems of thought in ways that were largely
consistent with their own traditions. And, as far as the Greeks went, it would appear
that their habits may have assimilated more in the direction of eastern thought than
eastern traditions assimilated themselves to the Greek. Perhaps the most striking
example of this was the ultimate conversion of the Greek kings who established
themselves in the Indus valley at the end of the second centur y to Buddhism
(Woodcock 1966: 112±4; Sharma 1980). A rather dif ferent set of results obtained
father west, where polis traditions were much stronger, in the case of various divinities
Hellenistic Religion 423



that were native to Anatolia, though, even here, earlier ideas about the relationship
between mor tal and immor tal are detectable.
Perhaps as a result of the vast distances involved, and the relatively small number of
Greeks, the interactions between peoples in Central Asia and Iran had no significant
impact upon the Mediterranean World ± it is Asoka who tells us of the missionaries he
sent to the kingdoms of the west, no Greek source repor ts them (Thapar 1997: 255±
6; Holt 1999: 53). Indeed, after Seleukos I's vigorous inter ventions in Central Asia, it
would appear that the Seleukid kings lost interest in the area, which may account for
the relatively rapid rise of independent states there in the course of the third centur y
B C which may help explain the increasing openness of Greeks to indigenous ideas
(Bernard 1994: 509±11). The same cannot be said of developments further to the
west.
There were two basic models of interaction between Greek thought and those of
Anatolia and Syria: one resulted in the alteration of a local god into a form of a Greek
divinity, usually retaining the original identity in the form of a specific cult title, for
example Zeus Ampelites; the other was the adaptation of the divinity under its own
name into a Greek context (Rober t 1983: 523±48). Three cults, those of Kybele,
Atar tagis and the Jewish god Yahweh, may of fer useful insight into the later process.
They are, in cer tain institutional ways, quite similar (if one will allow that there was no
parallel to the extensive literature generated by the followers of Yahweh, and that
auto-castration was never a par t of his cult). All three had a single primar y cult centre:
Pessinous in Galatia for Kybele, Hierapolis in Syria for Atar tagis and Jerusalem for
Yahweh. In the cases of Yahweh and Atar tagis we know that the temple cults were
governed by elaborate rules of procedure before the time of Alexander. Likewise,
again in the cases of Yahweh and Atar tagis, there was also a pronounced henotheistic
element, meaning that the divinity in question was thought to be the `greatest' by his
or her followers. We know somewhat less about the cult of Kybele, but it is clear that,
like Atar tagis, she was originally a divinity connected with fer tility, while Yahweh had
af finities with the widespread Aramaic cult of Hadad. What is, however, most signifi
cant about all three (although Atar tagis was often assimilated to Kybele) is that they
resisted ready assimilation to any Olympian divinity. Their followers created commu
nities in Greek cities, made of ferings in Greek (in the case of Yahweh's followers they
translated their sacred literature into Greek and created a further Greek literature) but
they appear to have retained the essential integrity of their practice. As we saw with
Asoka, the use of Greek as a vehicle for expression does not mean that the cult was
`hellenized' in the sense that it was transformed by Greek ideas, rather the use of
Greek made it possible to communicate with people beyond the homeland more
freely.
The cult centres of Atar tagis at Hierapolis, of Kybele at Pessinous and of Yahweh at
Jerusalem were essentially `temple-states' in that primar y temporal and religious
authority resided with a high priest (Debord 1982; Bof fo 1985: 18±23). The essen
tial elements of such states are spelled out in a quite detailed fashion by Strabo in his
description of another temple-state, that of the goddess Ma:
In this Anti-Tauros are deep and narrow valleys, in which are situated Komana and the
temple of Enyo, whom people there call Ma. It is a considerable city; its inhabitants,
however, consist mostly of `divinely inspired' people and the sacred slaves who live in it.
424 David Potter



Its inhabitants are Kataonians, who, though in a general way classified as subjects of the
king, are in most respects subject to the priest. The priest is master of the temple, and
also of the sacred slaves, who, on my sojourn there, were more than six thousand in
number, both men and women together. Also, considerable territor y belongs to the
temple, and the revenue is enjoyed by the priest. He is second in rank in Cappadocia after
the king. (12.2.3)
While the study of temple states may belong more properly to an account of Hellen
istic land tenure rather than one of religion, the ver y existence of such states raises
significant issues for the histor y of religion. Chief among these is the relationship
between the priest in the governing temple and votaries outside the immediate
territor y of the temple state. There appear to have been no hard and fast r ules here.
We know, for instance, that when a cult image of Kybele was brought to Rome from
its original home at Pessinous in 203, an of ficial cult was established that bore no
resemblance to practices in Asia Minor. Indeed, the Roman State accommodated two
quite dif ferent styles of worship for the goddess ± the second form being modelled on
procedures in Asia Minor. What we do not know is what impact the removal of the
goddess had on the celebration of her cult at home. So too it is clear that the many
Jewish communities around the Mediterranean and throughout the Near East
retained a formal connection with the temple of Yahweh at Jer usalem, as signified,
above all else by the annual tax that was paid each year to the High Priest (Schu È rer
1979: 272±4; Gr uen, this volume). Similarly, the priests who proclaimed the glories
of Atargatis around the Mediterranean World were, in theor y at least, to bring the
money they collected for the goddess back to her shrine at Hierapolis.
The tale of eastern divinities could be vastly expanded, and, to be sure, the cults of
Isis and Sarapis of fer significant parallels to those of Yahweh and Atar tagis, especially
the cult of Isis where a basic text, the so-called Aretology of Isis, was transmitted from
the central temple in Egypt (Dunand 1973: 1±4). Like the later translations of Jewish
scripture into Greek, the Aretology of Isis appears to have retained the sense of the
original text, although it appears to have been more open to the influence of Greek
thought than were Jewish texts. Indeed, the cult of Isis remained as recognizably an
Egyptian cult as the cult of Yahweh remained a recognizably Palestinian one, just as
the cult of Hadad, even if celebrated at Delos, remained recognizably Syrian (Mikal
son 1998: 233). The fact that each cult adapted dif ferently in the Greek environment
is a sign that the degree of adaptation was conditioned by the indigenous worship
pers.
The lack of significant evidence for these cults in the Aegean world prior to
Alexander's conquests, especially given the significant increase in evidence for these
cults in the next centur y, should not be seen as representing some profound shift in
religiosity. Rather it is evidence for a profound shift in political culture resulting from
the demise of the Persian Empire. The devotees of Phoenician, Egyptian and Syrian
cults were coming into the Aegean if not in greater numbers (this we cannot tell) then
at least with greater confidence in the adver tisement of their faith. Perhaps too, with
the removal of Persian domination, the Greek cities of the Aegean world were not
only more interesting, but also more welcoming to outsiders who might no longer be
seen as representatives of a power that threatened the life-style of the polis. Fur ther
more, the great stress that Ptolemaic or Seleukid kings laid upon their relationship
Hellenistic Religion 425



with Greek cities may have drawn the attention of other peoples, who might previ
ously have been less interested, to those places.
Greek poleis had always, of course, had the capacity to welcome new gods. In the
years after Alexander they welcomed more than they had before, but it would be
wrong to assume that this represented any significant new spirituality. Cults from
Syria and Egypt did attract worshippers from traditional poleis, but this should be
taken as a sign of the vitality of traditional polis religion: Athens or Delos could
provide space for an Isis, Sarapis or Hadad.
6 Oracles
This chapter has so far stressed institutional aspects of religion as being most readily
traceable across the vast spectrum of the Hellenistic world. There is, however, an
equally significant area of religious activity that has only been touched upon in
passing, but where the exchange of ideas between systems of religious thought may
have been even more power ful than on the institutional level. This area is the realm of
the individual professional, of the magician, the astrologer, the prophet and the
chresmologos. These practitioners are fundamentally the agents of active religious
activity in that they sought direct divine information for those who consulted them,
or provided information about the gods that was simply not available through the
mechanisms of public cult (Potter 1994: 12±13). Their qualifications were deter
mined by the results that they obtained rather than through any hard and fast rules as
to what constitute licit and illicit activity.
Magicians per formed valuable ser vices for the individual in need, be it in finding a
missing slave, a lover, or a change in the weather. They were threatening figures in
that they might be able to channel the power of a god to do some actual harm to one
person while helping another. A person who wished to ensure that he (or a friend)
would win an athletic contest might seek a spell that would weaken an opponent, a
man who had been rejected by a lover (our evidence for this sor t of activity is
over whelmingly from the male perspective) might seek a spell to compel the object
of his af fections to accept him. If one person hated another, he might seek a spell that
would incapacitate his enemy, or ruin his crops. So too a person who was uncer tain
about the future might consult a prophet or an astrologer about some business
activity, the advisability of a journey, or a question of personal health in the same
way that a city would seek the advice of the gods about these same matters. On the
other hand, this same person might be seeking information that would work to the
disadvantage of another ± if you knew that your neighbour was going to die, why not
break your agreement with him. From a ver y early period states legislated against
ef for ts to channel divine energy to the hur t of another, while allowing practitioners to
function freely if they did not do such things.
The search for ways to compel divine power to work for private individuals led to
an interest in what was perceived as `eastern wisdom'. It appears to have been
generally agreed in the classical period that various eastern peoples, especially
the Persians and the Egyptians had special knowledge of the divine (Potter 1994:
183±212). After the ruin of the Persian Empire the search for eastern wisdom picked
up pace, sometimes actually involving the integration of genuine eastern traditions
426 David Potter



into existing practice. There is some evidence for Babylonian calculations being used
by Greek astrologers, and other evidence for people seeking to meet the religious
professionals of eastern cultures (Neugebauer 1975: 1±4; 1988: 301±4). In time this
would impact on local traditions, especially in Egypt where temple of ficials would
know what Greeks were looking for and provide `improved' versions of local wisdom
that conformed with Greek expectations (Frankfur ter 1998: 217±48). It might also
lead to the translation of actual books of native lore into Greek. Perhaps the best
example of this, in the Egyptian context, is of fered by a book known asThe Oracle of
the Potter.
It appears that The Oracle of the Potter was originally composed in the first part of
the third centur y B C in Demotic, as a piece of local propaganda directed against the
Ptolemies (Koenen 1968; 1984). Two of our extant versions (on papyri of the Roman
period) seem to have been rewritten at the end of the second centur y after the failure
of a rebellion led by a man named Harsiesis. In this version, the redactor tried to
associate the text with an oracle of Ammon that made reference to a king of two years
in an ef fort to reconcile the situation predicted by the Potter with events occurring in
his own time. Another redactor seems to have quoted the passage in The Lamb of
Boccharis (a text of the late Persian period) that reads `the one of two, who is not our
(king), the one of fifty-five is our king', in order to correct the first interpretation
(Zauzich 1983: 165±74). Since Harsiesis' rebellion had lasted only two years, the
second author may be commenting on Harsiesis' failure by pointing out that he
cannot have been the saviour of Egypt predicted in the oracles, and commenting also
on the possibility that king Ptolemy Euergetes II, who may have been looked upon as
that saviour by some when he reached the fifty-fourth year of his reign in 116B C , was
not the right one either.
The Oracle of the Potter thus shows how wisdom could pass from an Egyptian
context to a Greek context outside the avenues of cult. It also shows how people
would use these texts as guides to the world around them, and how religious
language substituted for `plain speaking'. As we saw in the case of mythological
diplomacy, one value of appealing through the ancestors, heroes, gods and other
myths was that it provided an authority to a case that present circumstances might not
other wise justify. Oracular language was by definition the language of the gods
themselves ± it carried with it an authority derived from its divine origin that ordinar y
readings of events lacked. By removing contemporar y events from their temporal
context and placing them in a deeper, world-historical scheme, oracles validated the
desires of their readers, and enabled their authors to achieve some distance from the
par tisan realities of present circumstance. It is thus often to oracular literature that we
must turn to gain a perspective removed from the rhetoric of current circumstance.
The Book of Daniel, for instance, elevated the struggle of the Maccabaean rebels
against the Seleukids from a struggle over control of the temple and an internal
dispute over the way that Yahweh ought to be venerated, by placing it within a
universal scheme of world histor y (albeit one borrowed in places from Greek
thought). The struggle of the Jewish people for their distinctive ethnic identity lay
in the construction of histor y that allowed Daniel to overcome persecution and win
due regard from the great powers of the ear th through Yahweh's revelations. As we
now know, thanks to the discoveries at Qumran, there were earlier versions of par ts of
Hellenistic Religion 427



the book of Daniel that were reused and updated in the composition of the new text
(Kratz 1991). As the Qumran texts also show, prophetic texts and their interpretation
could help validate the claims of groups within Judaism to the propriety of their
version of histor y (Vanderkam 1994).
One power that recognized the authority of the Maccabaean dynasty at an early
date was Rome. Rome's place in the Hellenistic world was likewise the subject of
oracular prediction, in both suppor tive and hostile ways. The oracle that welcomed
Scipio's armies to the Hellespont in the campaign against Antiochos III was most
likely composed somewhere in the Troad as a way of contextualizing the rise of the
new power, just as the Trojan myth had been used to establish links between the cities
of the Aegean world and the great power to the west. So too would oracles be used to
establish the credentials of Rome's foes. Poseidonios notes the oracles that were
recited throughout the east in suppor t of Mithradates' first invasion of the province
of Asia, and it is no doubt to this context that an extraordinar y account of anti
Roman oracles preser ved in the second centur y AD
as an antiquarian curiosity by
Phlegon of Tralles, a freedman of the emperor Hadrian, also belongs. The stor y opens
after Antiochos' defeat at Ther mopylai when Buplagos, an of ficer of Antiochos who
had been killed, rose from the dead on the day following the battle and walked into
the Roman camp where he delivered a prophecy `in a soft voice' to the ef fect that
Zeus would send a mighty race against Italy and put an end to the r ule of the
Romans; he then dropped dead again. The Romans, who were understandably
upset by this turn of events, sent ambassadors to Delphi, where the Pythia told
them to cease their invasion on the spot and return home, for Athena was preparing
a power ful army that would destroy their kind. After receiving the Delphic oracle, the
Romans were withdrawing towards Naupaktos when an of ficer named Publius fell
into a prophetic fit and predicted that the Romans would suf fer disaster on their way
home from the conquest of Asia. When asked to explain what this meant, Publius
described, in reasonable detail, what would occur during the rest of the war with
Antiochos. He also obser ved that the returning army would be attacked by Thracians
and lose some of its booty. He then fell into another prophetic fit, foreseeing, among
other things, the destr uction of Rome at the hands of an invading army and his own
consumption by a wolf to prove that he had spoken the tr uth. The wolf duly arrived
and ate Publius, leaving only the head, which, once again, burst into prophetic song,
telling the Romans that Athena hated them, and that she would send a power ful army
from Asia which would destroy Italy and drag its people of f into slaver y. The account
ends with the statement that, `hearing these words, they (the Romans) were deeply
upset and established a temple and altar of Apollo L ykios where the head had lain and
got onto their ships and each one went to his own land. All the things that Publius
predicted have come tr ue' (FGrH 257 F36 III; Gauger 1980; W. Hansen 1996 for a
translation).
Not only does this stor y allow for multiple interpretations ± it could be read as a
tale of Sulla as easily as of Mithradates ± it also validates the impor tance of Delphi as a
source of tr ue wisdom in the new world of Rome. It is precisely this sor t of flexibility
that enabled oracular literature to mediate between traditions in a way that was not
possible for traditional polis cult. Polis cult might represent tradition, and as such it
was invaluable, but in an ever-changing world, it was to oracles that people might
turn in order to understand how their past would sur vive.

7 Conclusions
There are, of necessity, multiple avenues of approach to Hellenistic religion. Religion
in antiquity was in many ways a metaphor for power, both that of nature, which could
not be controlled, and that of mor tals for which it of fered a vehicle of expression. The
study of religious institutions will often tell a quite dif ferent stor y than the study of
individual behaviours, and this is as it should be. As the foundation for the passive
aspect of religion, that aspect that ser ved as a stabilizing force within society insti
tutions remained static. If seven Athenians had gone to sleep in a cave on Hymettos in
336 to awaken in 100 B C they would not have been greatly confused by the religious
structures that they confronted. Athena Polias was still in charge, the Eleusinian
Mysteries were still revered, great festivals of the past still would run their course
through the city. They might well wonder where some strange new gods had come
from, but they would know that the polis had a way of incorporating new cults that
was long sanctioned by tradition. They might be a bit taken aback by festivals for
kings who had received divine honours, but they might also recall that the city had
come close enough to creating such honours before they had gone to their long nap.
What would astonish them, however, would be a trip through the lands of the
collapsing Seleukid or Ptolemaic kingdoms. It is outside the structure of traditional
polis cult that religious life was changing, and had changed.
The interaction between Greek and non-Greek cults was, of course, not new. What
was different was the vitality of the discourse, and this is what should be meant by
terms such as hellenization and syncretism. Neither is much use in describing an end
result (a moving target in any case). But as terms that may describe discourse between
dif ferent groups they have genuine value, for they presume a process through which
ideas were exchanged, new habits formed, and old cer tainties questioned. It is the
tension between the stability of institutions like polis cult and the creation of new
institutions, the dialogue between groups, that reflects the intimate connection
between temporal and divine power in the ancient world.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Many years ago, my friend George Forrest asked me to write something on the
Hellenistic world rather than the Roman. When the editor invited me to write this
essay, I took it as an oppor tunity to acknowledge George's request, and if it has some
merit, that will be owed to George's insistence that Greek religion can best be
understood through the record of behaviours in the documentar y record.
FURTHER READING
For nearly a centur y work on the documents of the Hellenistic world has of fered a
dynamic picture of developments in the realm of religion. The bibliography here does
not come close to representing the contribution of Louis Rober t to the subject, and
Hellenistic Religion 429



any person interested in the serious study of Hellenistic religion must begin with a
perusal of the seven volumes of his Opera Minora Selecta. The insights offered in
Nock 1930 are of critical impor tance for understanding the relationship between
Greek and non-Greek systems of religious thought. Likewise the individual studies
collected in Nock 1972 are in many cases still fundamental.
For the structures of polis cult, Burker t 1985 and Vernant 1991, as well as Parker
1983, which is crucial on ideas relating to ritual purity. The most impor tant recent
development in the subject has stemmed from the study of the cult system at Athens.
Parker 1996 and Mikalson 1998 offer excellent treatments, calling attention to
continuity with the classical past and raising questions about what is genuinely
significant about religious developments in the period. Parker 2000 offers a valuable
insight into the par t played by religon in personal names. Rigsby 1996, Cur ty 1995,
C. Jones 1999b and Erskine 2001 are of critical impor tance for looking at the role of
religion in shaping diplomatic language. This in turn suppor ts the views of Habicht
1970, Nock 1972: 202±51 and Ma 1999: 219±26 about the place of cult for mor tals
in a civic context. Ma of fers a par ticularly detailed reading of cult for Antiochos III in
the formation of civic histor y.
For the study of the relationship between Greek and non-Greek, the work of
Koenen 1993 and Dunand 1973 on Ptolemaic ruler cult and the cult of Isis is of
great impor tance for viewing the interaction between Greek and Egyptian traditions.
Their conclusions are expanded upon in an exciting way by Frankfurter 1998, and
taken in new directions in Diller y 1999, a careful study of narrative types in Manetho.
They show that the view of Momigliano 1975 that Greeks tended to read all eastern
traditions through Greek lenses is in some need of emendation (though it remains
true in many cases). Perhaps the most significant challenge to Momigliano's view has
emerged in recent years as a result of the superb French excavations at Ai Khanoum,
and the collaborative work now being done by French and Russian scholars in the
territor y of the former Soviet Union. In some cases early conclusions such as those in
Ghirshman 1976 are open to challenge, as shown in Potts 1999, but the evidence is
now coming to light that enables a new understanding of the eastern reaches of the
Seleukid empire, see especially Bernard 1994 and the evidence collected in Holt
1999. For the Asoka texts Thapar 1997 remains critical. Study of indigenous cults
in Asia Minor has been under taken with genuine perception by Debord 1982 and
Bof fo 1985.
For the study of oracles and questions about the paradigm with which to view
classical religion, see Potter 1994. The problem of the relationship between religion
and magic (for which Graf 1997 is an excellent traditional introduction) has been
moved in new directions by the work of anthropologists who have concentrated on
the per formative nature of ritual, see esp. Gardner 1983.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers
Angelos Chaniotis
1 Introduction: the Paradox of Mortal Divinity
When King Demetrios Poliorketes returned to Athens from Kerkyra in 291, the
Athenians welcomed him with a processional song, the text of which has long been
recognized as one of the most interesting sources for Hellenistic ruler cult:
How the greatest and dearest of the gods have come to the city! For the hour has
brought together Demeter and Demetrios; she comes to celebrate the solemn mysteries
of the Kore, while he is here full of joy, as befits the god, fair and laughing. His
appearance is majestic, his friends all around him and he in their midst, as though they
were stars and he the sun. Hail son of the most powerful god Poseidon and Aphrodite.
(Douris FGrH 76 F13, cf. Demochares FGrH 75 F2, both at Athen. 6.253b-f; trans. as
Austin 35)
Had only the first lines of this ritual song sur vived, the modern reader would notice
the assimilation of the adventus of a mor tal king with that of a divinity, the etymo
logical association of his name with that of Demeter, the parentage of mighty gods,
and the external features of a divine ruler (joy, beauty, majesty). Ver y often scholars
reach their conclusions about aspects of ancient mentality on the basis of a fragment;
and ver y often ± unavoidably ± they conceive only a fragment of reality. For tunately,
in this case the rest of the hymn is preser ved:
For the other gods are either far away, or they do not have ears, or they do not exist, or
do not take any notice of us, but you we can see present here; you are not made of wood
or stone, you are real.
It is not surprising that this section of the hymn underlines the close and visible
presence of Demetrios the God. The visibility of divine power (epiphaneia) is an
essential feature of Greek religious beliefs. Surprising is rather the obvious inconsist
ency of these lines, in which doubt is cast upon the existence of other gods, and the
hymn's first lines, which welcome Demeter, praise Poseidon as a most powerful god,



and regard him and Aphrodite as Demetrios' divine parents. Inconsistencies in Greek
texts with a religious content should not surprise us ± not after the series of studies
which Henk Versnel has devoted to this phenomenon (1990; 1994). An inscription
from Perinthos presents a nice example (I.Perinthos 146). It quotes a funerar y
epigram that denies life after death: `What is the point of saying ``hail, passers-by''?
Life is what you see here; a singing cicada stops soon; a rose blossoms, but it soon
withers; a skin had been bound, now unfastened it has given up its air; when alive the
mor tal speaks, when he dies he is cold; the soul is carried away, and I have been
dissolved'. And yet this poem is par t of the funerar y inscription of a member of a cult
association of worshippers of Dionysos (the speire of the Sparganiotai) who must have
been initiated in this cult exactly because of its eschatological content. Instead of
looking for arguments to clear up the inconsistency in Demetrios' hymn, it is more
fruitful to ask what the composer of this text aimed at by diminishing the impor tance
of other gods and underlining the presence, visibility and reality of Demetrios. This
becomes clear in the last lines:
And so we pray to you: first bring us peace, dearest; for you have the power. And then,
the Sphinx that rules not only over Thebes but over the whole of Greece, the Aitolian
sphinx sitting on a rock like the ancient one, who seizes and carries away all our people,
and I have no defence against her (for it is an Aitolian habit to seize the proper ty
of neighbours and now even what is far afield). Most of all punish her yourself; if not
find an Oedipus who will either hurl down that sphinx from the rocks or reduce her to
ashes.
What makes Demetrios divine is his power to offer protection to the Athenians and
vengeance against those who had attacked them. In this sense the poem fully corres
ponds to the Greek idea of divinity, an essential feature of which is not immor tality,
but the willingness to hear the prayers of men and offer them help in need. Greek
religion knows of several gods ± notably Asklepios, Dionysos and Herakles ± who had
ascended Olympos after their death as mor tals, and a legion of privileged (and
restless) dead who had the ability to provide assistance, especially in war, and received
the worship of grateful (or terrified) humans. Extraordinar y achievements, such as
athletic victor y or the successful foundation of a colony, placed some mor tals above
the common dead and gave them the capacity to be at work even after death. In this
sense they overcame their mor tality. In the early Hellenistic period, Euhemeros of
Messene, a philosopher at the cour t of Kassandros, gave this idea a theoretical
foundation. In his Hiera anagraphe, or `Sacred Narrative', he describes a journey
to an island in the Indian Ocean which was the Olympians' land of origin; the
Olympians were mor tal kings who were worshipped after their death as gods because
of their vir tues (Euhemeros FGrH 63). Of course, there is a dif ference between the
heroized or deified dead and living, divine kings. The protective power of the former
manifests itself after their death, whereas the latter were expected to care for their
subordinates during their lifetime. Although the cult of kings continued ± and
sometimes was established for the first time ± after their death, there is no reference
to the miraculous appearance of a deceased ruler, analogous to the reports of the
epiphany of heroes; with the exception of Arsinoe II Philadelphos, protector of
432 Angelos Chaniotis



seamen, people do not seem to have appealed to the protection of a deceased r uler. If
kings had a claim to divine honours it was because of their achievements and
benefactions. This is what the epithets attributed to monarchs indicate: `the Saviour'
(
Soter
, attested, e.g., for Antigonos Monophthalmos and Demetrios Poliorketes,
Ptolemy I, Antiochos I, Antigonos Gonatas, Attalos I, Achaios, Philip V, Eumenes
I, Seleukos III, Ptolemy IX and Kleopatra), `the one with the manifest power'
(
Epiphanes
, attested for Antiochos IV); or `the winner of fair victories' (
Kallinikos
,
attested for Seleukos II and Mithradates I). Of these epithets,
Soter
and
Epiphanes
(or
Epiphanestatos
) are attested for a large number of deities, while
Kallinikos
is a
common epithet of Herakles. What places the kings on the same level with the
gods is the protection they of fer. This idea is expressed in an epigram from Pergamon
(
c
. 250±220; [
SEG
37.1020]; H. Mu È ller 1989) written on the base of the statue of
the satyr Skir tos. The statue was dedicated by an admiral of the Attalid fleet, Diony
sodoros, to both Dionysos
and
King Attalos I; such joint dedications to a god and a
king are not uncommon (e.g.
OGIS
17;
SEG
37.612; 39.1232). In the last line the
dedicator expresses his expectations: `may both of you take care of the dedicator'. The
expectation that a mor tal take care of another person does not necessarily make him
divine; but in this case the king and the god are associated not only in their function
as protectors of Dionysodoros but also as joint recipients of his dedication. With both
`gods' Dionysodoros had a close personal relationship; he was in the ser vice of
Attalos, but he was also the `gift' of Dionysos (Dionyso-doros), the patron god of
the Attalids.
The power to of fer protection is an essential feature of the king's mor tal divinity;
this explains why in the earliest phases of Hellenistic royal cult it was not the r uler
himself who declared his divinity, but usually the real or potential recipient of his
benefactions (cf. section 4 below). Since Hellenistic kings, or at least most of them,
resembled the immor tal gods in the care they took for humans, they deser ved to
receive similar expressions of gratitude as the gods. The Greek phrase which is often
used to describe the establishment of divine honours expresses no more and no less
than this: the king is to receive
isotheoi timai
(e.g.
IG
12.7, 506;
SEG
41.75), i.e.
honours equal to those bestowed upon the gods. Rather than equating the king to
the gods, with this phrase the grateful community asser ts in a subtle way that the king
is not
a god, even though he receives the same honours from the thankful community.
The attribute
theos
(`god') was usually given to a king or a queen only posthumously
(e.g.
OGIS
246). The sharp distinction between the immor tal gods and the mor tal
recipients of divine honours is clear in a letter of Zeuxis, Antiochos III's gover nor in
Asia Minor, in which he quotes a decree of Herakleia upon the Latmos (
SEG
37.859,
c
. 196). Zeuxis refers to the establishment of a monthly sacrifice for `the gods (
theoi
),
the king and queen, and their children'. The word
theoi
does not comprise the royal
family, albeit the latter shares in the same monthly sacrifice. The godlike royals receive
godlike honours, but are not gods; their mor tality makes all the dif ference. Even the
most divine of r ulers, Alexander, is said to have made a bitter joke exactly on his own
mor tality; when wounded, he assured his companions that what they saw was blood,
not `
ichor
, that which r uns in the veins of the blessed divinities' (Plut.
Alex
. 28). As
the `royal journals' repor t, until the ver y end of his life Alexander behaved as a mor tal,
never neglecting to sacrifice to the gods (
FGrH
117 F3).

2 Historical Development and Local Variants
Long before the beginning of the Hellenistic period the Greeks had been bestowing
divine honours upon extraordinar y individuals (city-founders, athletes, etc.) after
their death, but the first mor tal known to have received godlike honours during his
own lifetime was the Spar tan general L ysandros (Douris FGrH 76 F71 and 26): the
Samians erected an altar, offered him sacrifices, sang cultic songs and renamed the
festival of Hera the L ysandreia (c. 404). These honours foreshadow later develop
ments: in response to the extraordinar y achievements of an individual (victor y over
the Athenians) and as an expression of gratitude for a ser vice (the return of the Samian
oligarchs) a mor tal received honours that were commonly reser ved for the gods. But
still substantial dif ferences between the worship of the gods and the honours for the
mor tal can be obser ved: there is, for instance, no reference to a cult statue or to a
shrine, and there can be little doubt that these rituals were ephemeral. The immediate
predecessor of Hellenistic ruler cult is the cult of two Macedonian kings, Amyntas III,
to whom a shrine (Amynteion) is said to have been dedicated at Pydna, and his son
Philip II. Leaving aside several controversial testimonies concerning a divine cult
introduced by Greek cities (Amphipolis, Ephesos and Eresos) and a report that Philip
himself insinuated his divinity shor tly before he was murdered, by having his (cult?)
image carried in a procession together with the images of the twelve Olympians
(Diod. 16.92.5), we now have unequivocal evidence for his cult at Philippi, possibly
already in existence in his lifetime. An inscription from there concerning the sale of
sacred land (temene) lists among the possessors not only gods (Ares and Poseidon)
and the Heroes but also Philip (SEG 38.658; c. 350±300). Of course, Philippi is a
par ticular case, as it was a city founded by Philip II, who was worshipped there as the
ktistes (`founder') according to a widespread custom which was followed also by the
Hellenistic kings in the cities that they founded.
The worship of Alexander is a complex phenomenon, heavily obscured by unreli
able anecdotes. Although it was based on an existing tradition, it still dif fers from
both its immediate predecessors and later developments. The ver y fact that his
militar y achievements had surpassed anything the Greeks had hither to known made
a big dif ference; in his attack against Aornos the Macedonian conqueror competed
with Herakles, who had allegedly failed to take this citadel, and his conquest of India
was comparable in the eyes of contemporaries with its mythological precedent,
India's conquest by the god Dionysos (Edmunds 1971; Hahn 2000: 16±19, 68±9,
82±6). New too was the influence of non-Greek practices, such as the display of
obeisance in the Persian cour t or the divine worship of the pharaoh. But other facets
of the divine worship of Alexander during his lifetime can be paralleled with earlier
phenomena and with later Hellenistic developments. That he counted among his
ancestors heroes, the sons of gods themselves (Achilles and Herakles), was not
uncommon in his world; in Athens the Kynnidai claimed descent from Apollo and
the Asklepiadai of Kos were regarded as the descendants of Asklepios; this tradition of
consanguinity with heroes and gods was continued by most Hellenistic dynasties, for
example with the Ptolemies claiming descent from both Herakles and Dionysos and
the Seleukids from Apollo. The divine ancestr y of the ruling king also had a long
tradition in Egypt, where Alexander as the ruling pharaoh was the son of Ammon-Re;
naturally, this belief was adopted by the Ptolemies in their ver y careful amalgamation
434 Angelos Chaniotis



of indigenous Egyptian religious elements and their own distinctive royal ideology.
Alexander introduced, however, an additional element in his divinity with the claim
that he was the son of Zeus. The date and the circumstances in which this claim was
made (after his visit to the oracle at Siwa?) are a matter of controversy, but it should be
noted that such a claim was not unknown in Greek histor y. As late as the fifth centur y
the famous Thasian athlete Theagenes was believed to be the son of Herakles and his
colleague Euthymos of Lokroi was regarded as the son of the river-god Kaikinos
(Paus. 6.9.2, 6.6.4). Alexander's claim to a direct descent from a god found at least
one follower among his successors; a hymn discovered in Er ythrai regards Seleukos I
as the son of Apollo (I.Er ythrai 205 LSAM 24B). In most respects the cult of
Alexander continued and strengthened the existing traditions. It was established in
many cities in Asia Minor, probably already during his campaign, in response to his
achievements and his benefactions (Habicht 1970: 17±25) and in content and form it
did not dif fer from earlier cases (erection of an altar and sometimes a shrine, of fering
of sacrifices, contests (agones), dedication of a statue in the temple of another god,
establishment of a priesthood, naming civic tribes after him). These separate honours
have an entirely dif ferent quality from the joint celebration of Alexander's divinity
that occurred shor tly before his death, when, as a result of a proclamation he had
issued demanding divine honours for himself, the cities of the Greek mainland sent
sacred envoys to Babylon to honour the king as a god (Arr. Anab. 7.23.2).
An impor tant dif ference from the cult of both earlier mor tals and that of later kings
is the wide dif fusion, popularity and persistence of Alexander's worship (Habicht
1970: 25, 185). In Egypt, the cult of Alexander was suppor ted by Ptolemy I as par t of
his ef for ts to legitimize his rule, and this worship was continued under the later
Ptolemies. But the cult remained popular also in areas in which it was not par t of the
monarchical ideology. An interesting piece of evidence came to light recently: the
ancient visitors to a Macedonian grave of the four th centur y in Pella incised on its
walls dedicator y texts addressed to Herakles, Heros Alexandros and Kassandros; the
mention of Herakles in this context rules out the possibility that Alexandros and
Kassandros were some ordinar y dead; we are dealing with a private worship of
Alexander the Great and King Kassandros (SEG 47.933). In Priene in the second
centur y private persons repaired his shrine, the Alexandreion (I.Priene 108, 75);
Er ythrai's budget in the early second centur y included funds for sacrifices to his
honour (LSAM 26, 90); in the second centur y A D Bargylia replaced (or repaired) a
statue of `Alexander the God' (OGIS 3), and priests of King Alexander are still
attested in Ephesos in the second centur y A D (I.Ephesos 719) and in Er ythrai as late
as the third centur y A D (IGRR 1543 I.Er ythrai 64). A statue of Alexander
dedicated by Thessalonike in the Severan period designates him as `the great
king Alexander, the son of Zeus' (SEG 47.960, c. A D 200±250). We can associate
with Alexander's worship also a series of contests by the name of `Alexandreia' or
`Alexandreios agon' that existed centuries after Alexander's death (e.g. in Alexandria,
Beroia, Rhodes and Smyrna).
The honouring of achievement, benefaction, militar y success and protection with
divine honours had already a long tradition when Alexander's successors received the
title of `king'. Even `ordinar y' companions were honoured with festivals, as, for
instance, Aristonikos for whom the agon Aristonikeia was established in Kar ystos
(Athen. 1.19a, IG 12.9.207, 41); Philetairos, the Pergamene dynast who never
The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers 435



received the title of `king', was honoured with festivals in Kyme and Kyzikos (Man
ganaro 2000). All the Successors were honoured with cults in cities suppor ted or
subordinated by their troops, and of course they received the traditional worship as
founders in the cities they (re-)founded (e.g. Kassandros in Kassandreia, Demetrios
Poliorketes in Demetrias, L ysimachos in Ephesos, the first Seleukids in Antioch on
the Maeander and in Mygdonia, Apollonia in Karia and Pisidia, Laodikeia on the
L ykos, Nysa, etc.). In the study of royal cult one should make a distinction between
the (more widely attested) introduction of the worship of a living king or queen by a
polis and the establishment of a royal cult by the royal administration. This latter
procedure entails two dif ferent aspects, the establishment by a king of the worship of
a deceased family member (father, parents, wife), a phenomenon attested from the
beginning of the Hellenistic period, and, at a much later date, the introduction by the
ruler of a cult of himself.
The first procedure, the creation of a cult of the ruler by a polis, is best demon
strated by the cult of Antigonos the One-Eyed and Demetrios Poliorketes in Athens,
set up after the expulsion of Kassandros' garrison (Plut. Demetr. 8±13; Diod.
20.45.2; Polyaen. 4.7.6; Habicht 1970: 44±8). Antigonos and Demetrios were
regarded as saviours (Soteres) and liberators of the city. A decree introduced the office
of the `priest of the Saviours' (cf. Dreyer 1998), an altar was erected, the names of the
benefactors were given to two new tribes (Antigonis and Demetrias), and an annual
festival, with procession, sacrifice and agon, was founded. A similar procedure was
repeated countless times in many cities and for almost ever y known monarch; the
many new inscriptions that come to light usually confirm the same stereotypical
practice. One of the most recent finds is a letter of queen Laodike (213 B C ), with
which she accepts the honours bestowed to her by Sardis. The Sardians decreed the
foundation of a sacred enclosure or temenos (Laodikeion), an altar, a yearly festival or
panegyris (Laodikeia) on her birthday, the 15
th of Hyperberetaios, a procession, and a
sacrifice to Zeus Genethlios, protector of the royal family; for three days during the
Laodikeia Antiochos III granted an exemption from taxes (SEG 39.1284±5; Gauthier
1989, nos. 2±3; Ma 1999: 285±8). An instructive example is also provided by the
decree of Pergamon concerning the establishment of the cult of Attalos III in the
Asklepieion after a victorious campaign: the demos was to dedicate a statue repre
senting the victorious king standing on war booty in the temple of Asklepios Soter,
`so that he may be sharing the temple with the god' (synnaos toi theoi); another statue
representing the king on a horse was to be erected next to the altar of Zeus Soter; on
this altar the eponymous magistrate, the king's priest, and the of ficial responsible for
competitions were to burn ever y day incense `for the king'; an annual procession and
sacrifice celebrated the anniversar y of the king's return to Pergamon (I.Perg. 246;
Virgilio 1993: 23±7). Sometimes the establishment of the cult was sanctioned with
the help of an oracle, as in the case of the cult of Arsinoe Philadelphos in Kos ( Iscr.
Cos. ED 61).
The second procedure, the deification of a deceased king or queen by the royal
administration, is best attested in the Ptolemaic kingdom. When Ptolemy I died in
283, his son and successor Ptolemy II declared him a god; the same honour was
bestowed upon Ptolemy's widow Berenike in 279. The deceased royal couple was
worshipped under the name theoi soteres (the saviour gods). When Arsinoe, Ptolemy
II's wife and sister died (July 270), her cult was introduced in the temples of all the
436 Angelos Chaniotis



native gods; her death may have also prompted Ptolemy II to attach his cult and that
of Arsinoe to the cult of Alexander, adding the name of the `Brother-Sister Gods'
(theoi Philadelphoi) to the title of Alexander's priest; his successor did the same, and
the other kings followed this example. Thus this cult in Alexandria was transformed
into an eponymous state cult; the reference to its eponymous priest in the dating
formula of documents fulfilled an impor tant symbolic function, underlining both
dynastic continuity and the monarchy's divine nature. Thus the text of the Rosetta
stone under Ptolemy V reads: `during the priesthood of Aetos, son of Aetos, priest of
Alexander and Saviour Gods and the Brother-Sister Gods and the Benefactor Gods
and the Father-loving Gods and the Manifest and Beneficent God' ( OGIS 90). In
addition to this cult, the Ptolemies were also worshipped as `temple-sharing deities'
(synnaoi theoi) in the Egyptian temples and received daily libations and incense
of ferings (Lanciers 1993: 214±15; cf. Huss 1994). Their Greek cult-names (Soter,
Euergetes, Philadelphos, Philopator, Philometor, Epiphanes, Eucharistos) sounded
Greek to the Greeks, but at the same time captured many of the tenets of Egyptian
titular y and allowed the native population to recognize in them their pharaoh
(Koenen 1993); in general, the native population accepted the r uler cult.
The third procedure, the establishment of cult of the living monarch in the entire
kingdom by the r uler himself, is best documented in the kingdom of Seleukids. In the
early Hellenistic period the cult of the Seleukids did not dif fer substantially from that
of other monarchs: cults of the living kings and queens were established at the
initiative of individual cities, and the deification of the deceased monarch was a
standard procedure from the time of Antiochos I. The first Seleukid king who
established his own cult during his lifetime was Antiochos III the Great. A series of
letters to the provincial governors that request the nomination of a high priest in the
provinces for his wife Laodike mention an already existing high priest for the cult of
Antiochos himself and for that of his ancestors ( RC 36; SEG 37.1010); this of fice
(archiereus) was introduced in 209 (Lanciers 1993: 218±19; Ma 1999: 288±92; H.
Mu È ller 2000). When the Attalids took over the largest par t of Asia Minor (188/187)
they retained the institution of the high priest for their own dynastic cult ( SEG
47.1519). In the Seleukid kingdom the r uler cult seems to have been limited only
to the Greek population (Lanciers 1993).
Things were dif ferent in the realm of the Antigonids, where the Greek traditions
were strong. The cult of the monarch was widespread, but only as a polis institution;
even Antigonos Gonatas, who for a long time was believed to have rejected the
establishment of his cult in cities under his control, is now known to have received
godlike honours in Athens (Habicht 1996).
At the peripher y of the Hellenistic world, where the non-Greek element was
predominant, r uler cult was sometimes based on an elaborate theological back
ground, as is the case with Kommagene, where Antiochos I introduced cult refor ms
that combined Iranian cultic elements with his royal ideology. But these forms of
divine worship of the king are dif ferent in nature from the cult as it was established by
and practised within the Greek cities. The organization and content (section 3 below)
as well as the role of r uler cult in the Hellenistic world (section 4 below) are essentially
Greek phenomena, both in the sense that they continue Greek traditions and in the
sense that they are related to the interaction between Hellenistic r ulers and Greek
cities.
The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers 437



3 Organization and Content
The organization of ruler cult was from its ver y beginning modelled after the worship
of the gods. It was centred around the ritual of the sacrifice (thysia) which is one of
the indispensable elements of a Greek festival (panegyris, rarely heorte); additional
elements were the procession (pompe) and an athletic or musical competition (agon).
The festivals in honour of kings and queens were named after the person they
intended to honour (Attaleia, Eumeneia, Alexandria, Ptolemaia, etc.). When the
cult was established during the lifetime of a ruler or a member of the royal family,
the rituals usually took place on his or her bir thday ± similarly, the bir thday of a deity
is the day of its major festival. Exactly as in the worship of the gods, a sacrifice was
of fered not only annually, but ever y month on the same day. When the cult was
introduced after a person's death, it was celebrated either on the anniversar y of the
death (Habicht 1970: 17 n. 5) or on the bir thday (Habicht 1998 onI.Didyma 488).
Other impor tant occasions were the anniversar y of the accession to the throne, the
anniversar y of a victor y, or the day the new magistrates assumed of fice; for example,
during the reign of Ptolemy III the 25
th day of ever y month was `the day of the king',
a festival which commemorated the king's accession to the throne on 25
th Dios 246
(I.Louvre 5); in c. 246/244 Ilion established a `good-tidings-sacrifice' (euangelia) for
Seleukos II (I.Ilion 35). Occasionally the celebration of the ruler was appended to an
already existing festival. In addition to the monthly and annual sacrifices, a par ticular
achievement or benefaction could be the occasion for the of fering of an extraordinar y
sacrifice.
The festival began with a procession to which all the citizens were invited, wearing
wreaths and their best clothes (e.g. OGIS 11; SIG
3
372). The city processions could
not compete in glamour with those organized by the royal administration but they
were influenced by them. The most impressive procession was the one organized by
Ptolemy II in honour of his deceased father; its description by Kallixeinos of Rhodes
is the fullest description of an ancient celebration (in Athen. 5.194a±203b, Rice
1983). Highlighting the royal family's af finity to the gods, this Ptolemaic procession
demonstrated the king's political and militar y supremacy as it progressed through the
streets of Alexandria; the population was here the audience for a lavishly-staged
spectacle, in contrast to the city processions which enlisted the inhabitants as active
per formers. Religious songs too would be sung at festivals; an inscription from
Er ythrai, for instance, preser ves par t of a hymn which calls Seleukos a son of Apollo
(I.Er ythrai 205 LSAM 24B). The city festivals for kings offered an additional
oppor tunity for the organization of athletic and musical contests which ver y often
sur vived long after a king's death. At Laodikeia on the L ykos the annual athleticagon
Antiocheia, named after the founder of the city, Antiochos II, continued to be
celebrated into the second centur y (I.Laodikeia 5); and in Pergamon the cult of the
deceased ruler was still practised long after his death, even after the end of the dynasty
(Virgilio 1993). Our most detailed evidence for the organization of a festival comes
from the decree of the Euboian cities about the Demetria in honour of Demetrios
Poliorketes (IG 12.9.207).
The of fering of the sacrifice required an altar, which was usually erected in a sacred
precinct (temenos) which bore the king's name (e.g. Philetaireion in Iasos). An
impor tant dif ference between ruler cult and the cult of the gods is that temples
438 Angelos Chaniotis



(naoi) were rarely dedicated to rulers, either living or dead; only literar y sources refer
to temples of kings (of Alexander in Athens, of Seleukos I in Lemnos, of Ptolemy II in
Byzantion) and only in the context of the polis cult. Little is known about the
architectural form and decoration of the temene and temples, and only a few excav
ated buildings have been tentatively identified as places of ruler worship (Radt 1989:
Pergamon; Borchhardt 1991: Limyra). The erection of a statue was an intrinsic par t
of the honours, but it is often dif ficult to distinguish between honorific and cult
statues. When the documents designate the king's image as an agalma (not an eikon
or an andrias) they usually refer to a cult statue. One of the earliest epigraphic
testimonies for ruler cult, a decree of Skepsis in honour of Antigonos Monophthal
mos (OGIS 6, trans. in Austin 32), expresses the establishment of divine honours with
the phrase `let the city mark off a sacred precinct for him, erect an altar and set up a
(cult) statue as beautiful as possible'. The Hellenistic kings were often worshipped as
`temple-sharing gods' (synnaoi) through the erection of their statue in the temple of
other deities (e.g. Attalos I in Aigina and Sikyon, Antiochos III and Apollonis in Teos,
Attalos III in Pergamon, Ariarathes V in Athens and Mithradates VI on Delos:
Schmidt-Dounas 1993±4). In Hellenistic Egypt not the living kings, but only the
deceased ones seem to have received a cult as synnaoi in the temples of other deities
(Fishwick 1989). In general, Hellenistic cities preferred to honour a king by estab
lishing a separate shrine for him, naturally in the city's most prominent place.
Sometimes the sanctuaries of rulers were the places where public documents are
inscribed; it seems quite natural that in Arsinoe in Cilicia public documents were
inscribed in the sanctuar y of the queen to whom the city owed its name, Arsinoe II
(SEG 39.1426). Sacrifices and shrines in most cases required the existence of a special
priest; the priesthood of Eumenes II, for example, was one of the many priesthoods
of fered by Kos for sale (Iscr.Cos. ED 182). In the long list of the city's priesthoods at
Seleukeia in Pieria two priests of the rulers feature (OGIS 245, c. 187±175): one for
the deceased kings (Seleukos Zeus Nikator, Antiochos Apollon Soter, Seleukos
Kallinikos, Seleukos Soter, Antiochos, Antiochos Megas) and another for the living
monarch (Seleukos IV). Sometimes the priest was the eponymous of ficial of the city
(e.g. the priest of L ysimachos in Kassandreia, the priest of Seleukos I in Dura
Europos, the priest of Antiochos III and his homonymous son in Xanthos).
4 Historical Significance
In order to understand the historical significance of Hellenistic royal cult one should
rather exclude the cult of Alexander from the discussion; his exceptional achieve
ments and his personal idiosyncrasies probably confuse the general picture. It would
be tempting to claim that the royal cult was introduced in the beginning of the
Hellenistic period in order to provide Alexander's successors with the legitimacy they
lacked. Indeed, there can be little doubt that the Hellenistic kings exploited their cult
in order to underscore the charismatic nature of their rule. But do the results of the
royal cult necessarily explain the intentions behind its introduction? How can we
explain the fact that to best of our knowledge in the early Hellenistic period the cult
of living monarchs was always established at the initiative of poleis and not at the
initiative of monarchs? Unlike the cult of Alexander which was imposed on thepoleis
towards the end of his life ± Hypereides uses the verb anankazo (`force, compel')
The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers 439



twice with regard to Alexander's cult in Athens (6.21) ± there is no such reference
with regard to the successors; on the contrar y, Demochares (FGrH 75 F1) reports
that Demetrios Poliorketes was deeply annoyed at the flatter y of the Athenians. Do
we solve this problem by simply suspecting that the poleis introduced ruler cult as a
response to the monarch's expectations or to the discreet requests of his friends? Were
the Hellenistic cities and their political leaders the passive recipients of royal com
mands or suggestions? It is mainly the epigraphic evidence that compels us to look for
an explanation for civic ruler cult not in the intentions of the monarchs but in the
interests of the poleis. The relevant inscriptions suggest that royal cult was an instru
ment used by the poleis in order to establish a close relationship with a monarch and
directly express both their gratitude for past and their expectation of future benefac
tions. The narratio of the relevant decrees explains the cult not as recognition of
superhuman, godlike achievements, but as recognition of past ser vices. This idea is
clearly expressed in a decree of the League of Islanders: `the Islanders were the first to
have honoured Ptolemy Soter with godlike honours because of his ser vices to
individuals' (IG 12.7.506, trans. in Austin 218; cf. IG 12.5.1008; I.Cret. 3.4.4).
Similarly, the kings and queens responded to these honours by promising to consider
the interests of the cities. Eumenes II, for example, writes to the Ionian League: `the
honours I accept kindly and having never failed, as far as it lay in my power, to confer
always something of glor y and honour jointly upon you all and individually upon
your cities, I shall now tr y not to diverge from such a precedent' (RC 52; cf. RC 22;
SEG 39.1284B).
A common feature of Hellenistic decrees is the so-called hor tator y formula, which
usually states that a city honours a benefactor in public in order to demonstrate its
gratitude and thus encourage others to behave in a beneficial way (e.g. SEG 1.366,
trans. Austin 113: `so that we may be seen to be honouring good men and encour
aging many citizens to follow the same course of action'). The same strategy of
delicate negotiations between polis and benefactor explains to a great extent why it
is the polis which takes the initiative in introducing the cult of the living king. In order
to encourage royal liberality, the cities accepted for themselves the image of the
inferior, weak and needy, constructing in exchange for the monarch an image of
supremacy and unlimited power. This theatrical behaviour underlies many aspects
of the fragile balance of power between the monarchic aspirations and the pretensions
of urban populations (Chaniotis 1997a: 252±3; cf. Ma 1999: 179±242). By compel
ling the king to live up to his godlike image, the poleis secured for themselves his
protection. This is, of course, not to say that the monarchs did not recognize the
potential inherent in these honours and did not actively promote their cult. Eumenes
II again provides a characteristic example when accepting honours from the Ionian
League in 167/166: `In order that for the future, by celebrating a day in my honour
in the Panionian Festival, you may make the whole occasion more illustrious, I shall
present you with an adequate income from which you will be able to remember us
suitably' (OGIS 763, RC 52, trans. Welles). As a religious phenomenon the ruler cult
corresponds to the mentality of do ut des that characterizes the relations of the Greeks
to their gods, in general (cf. Grotanelli 1991).
Within their kingdoms the royal cult gave the monarchs, especially the Ptolemies
and the Attalids, an additional ideological suppor t for their power. It also allowed the
native population to par ticipate in a worship in which it would have been able to
440 Angelos Chaniotis



recognize familiar elements both in the cult practice and in the religious vocabular y.
The interdependence of Greek and native elements has been obser ved in Ptolemaic
ruler cult: in 263 the quota of produce (apomoira) from vineyards and orchards not
attached to the temples, which had previously been paid to the native Egyptian
temples, was diverted to the cult of Arsinoe II (Clar ysse and Vandorpe 1998) and
the dates of dynastic festivals often followed Egyptian traditions (Koenen 1993).
In cities under the direct or indirect control of a monarch, the existence of a priest
of the living king or his ancestors underlined this position of dependence. In Xanthos,
for instance, the priest of Ptolemy IV Philopator, Berenike and Ptolemy V was one of
the eponymous priests of the city (SEG 38.1476, 206/205), and in both Nagidos
and Arsinoe the cults of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II were of central impor tance
(SEG 39.1426, c. 238). In such dependent cities an impor tant instrument of monar
chical power was the garrison; the commander and his soldiers became bearers of the
dynastic ideology, primarily through their dedications addressed to, for the welfare of,
or in honour of the king and members of the royal house. In Thera all dedications
addressed to the deified Ptolemaic kings, in which the names of the dedicators are
known to us, were initiated by members of the garrison. The role of garrisons in the
promulgation of the royal cult can be seen best in Itanos on Crete, precisely because
the dynastic cult is a peripheral phenomenon on this island. A Ptolemaic garrison was
established there during the reign of Ptolemy III at the latest. During his reign the
Itanians dedicated a temenos to the king and to Queen Berenike and established
annual sacrifices; in the relevant document Ptolemy is praised for protecting the city
and its laws (I.Cret. 3.4.4, c. 246?). Once established, the dynastic cult could be
continued, obviously under the care of the garrison commanders, thephrourarchoi. It
is the commander of the garrison, a Roman, who made a dedication to Ptolemy IV
Philopator and Queen Arsinoe (I.Cret. 3.4.17, c. 217±209). It is less cer tain that the
dynastic cult of the Ptolemies in Cyprus was established by the garrisons (Bagnall
1976: 68±73), but it was cer tainly promoted by them. In Ephesos, a commander
of troops and the soldiers made a dedication to Ptolemaios II, Arsinoe II and the
Theoi Soteres (i.e. Ptolemy I and Berenike) after having of fered a sacrifice to them
(SEG 39.1234). With such actions ± whether guided by the royal administration or
not ± the garrisons reminded the local population that there was a divine element
inherent in kingship and made the presence of the king felt in the city (Chaniotis
2002).
Although royal cult was primarily promoted by cities and kings, it did not possess
only an of ficial character. The private worship of the dead or living monarch was
explicitly requested in some decrees. In Teos, for example, the inhabitants of non
citizen status were asked to celebrate the festival for Antiochos III and Laodike and
of fer sacrifices in their houses (SEG 41.1003 II 25±6) and to bring first-fruit of ferings
to the king's cult statue (II 53±5); the water of a fountain dedicated to Laodike was to
be used in sacrifices, purifications and wedding rituals (II 70±83). At Iasos, the
newlyweds were obliged to offer a sacrifice to Laodike (I.Iasos 4.85±8; Ma 1999:
329±35). In a few cases we know of dedications made to Hellenistic kings and queens
by individuals (e.g. OGIS 17). Usually these individuals were soldiers or officials in
the royal administration who expressed in this way loyalty, solidarity with the mon
arch, gratitude or hopes for patronage (e.g. SEG 37.1020; I.Cret. 3.4.17). The
expression of loyalty and gratitude also explains the worship of sovereigns by the
The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers 441



Dionysiac associations, for instance in Pergamon (Radt 1989) and in Athens ( IG 2
2
1330). Things are dif ferent in the case of Arsinoe II who was posthumously assimi
lated with Isis and Aphrodite and became one of the most popular goddesses in Egypt
and on Cyprus. Two of the earliest attestations of Arsinoe's cult are private dedica
tions: the Ptolemaic admiral Kallikrates dedicated a temple of Arsinoe/Aphrodite at
Cape Zephyrion, near Kanopos, and in Halikarnassos Chairemon established a sanc
tuar y of Sarapis, Isis and Arsinoe Philadelphos; Kallikrates' dedication underscores
the worship of Arsinoe as a patron of sailors, an aspect which may be explained either
in the light of her assimilation with Aphrodite Euploia or in the light of Arsinoe's
maritime policy (Malaise 1994). From Cyprus we know of more than twenty altars for
the household cult of Arsinoe in various cities; her cult was continued for a centur y
after her death (Nicolaou 1993; Anastassiades 1998). Altars for the cult of Arsinoe
Philadelphos have been found in private houses as far away as Eretria and Miletos
(SEG 40.763; Milet I.7, nos. 288±9); their owners may have had trade contacts with
Egypt. Occasionally, we get insights into the practice of ruler cult; for instance, in a
village in the Delta an association of farmers honoured the benefactor Paris by
crowning his statues on the festive days (eponymoi hemerai) on which sacrifices to
the kings were of fered (Bernand 1992: no. 40; 67 and 64B C ). At the border between
public and private cult we find the cult of the ruler in the gymnasium, often in
gymnasia that had received royal benefactions. Here where the young men, especially
those of the elite, were educated and imbued with the values of their community,
ruler cult played a crucial par t.
Ruler cult established a close relationship between the subject and the object of a
benefaction; it was quite natural that it influenced a similar relationship betweenpoleis
and benefactors who did not possess royal status. Already at the beginning of the
Hellenistic period friends of Demetrios Poliorketes received heroic honours in Athens
(Habicht 1970: 55±8). A new interesting document from Laodikeia on the L ykos
(I.Laodikeia 1, c. 267) attests divine honours for Achaios, a member of the Seleukid
family, and his of ficials Banabelos and Lachares; they were honoured by the inhabit
ants of Neon Teichos and Kiddiou Kome with the establishment of their cult for their
ser vices during a war against the Gauls. A yearly sacrifice of an ox was to be of fered to
Achaios Soter in the sanctuar y of Zeus in Baba Kome, a sacrifice of three rams to
Lachares and Banabelos Euergetai in the sanctuar y of Apollo in Kiddiou Kome. Long
after the abolishment of the Attalid monarchy, the Pergamenes modelled the divine
honours bestowed upon their benefactor Diodoros Pasparos after the honours they
had decreed for king Attalos III (OGIS 332, c. 139±133). The honours included the
erection of cult statues, the establishment of a temenos and a temple, the celebration
of a festival, the appointment of a priest, the creation of an eponymous tribe and his
praise as a founder or ktistes (Radt 1986; Virgilio 1995).
The success of ruler cult both as a medium for the communication between ruler
and subordinate civic community and for the legitimation of monarchical power can
be best seen in the fact that it continued long after the end of the Hellenistic period as
par t of the ideology of the Principate. The Greek cities used this familiar instrument
from the ver y beginning of their relations with Roman generals: T. Quinctius Flami
ninus was the first Roman to have received godlike honours (in Chalkis), and others
followed. Provincial governors, in par ticular, were honoured in the same way Greek
cities used to honour monarchs (Halfmann 1987). Late Ptolemaic Egypt played a
442 Angelos Chaniotis



ver y impor tant par t in the transmission of the ruler cult to Rome. It is probable that
Caesar received divine honours in Alexandria (Fishwick 1987), and it is cer tain that
Mark Antony was assimilated with Dionysos and Herakles (Heinen 1995). The
Kaisareion in Alexandria, whether first dedicated to Divus Julius, Mark Antony or
Octavian, presents an early example of a shrine for a Roman general. It is not
surprising that in the Greek East, the cult of Octavian/Augustus was modelled after
Hellenistic traditions. Exactly as Hellenistic sovereigns were assimilated to Greek
divinities (e.g. Seleukos I-Zeus, Antiochos I-Apollo, Arsinoe II-Isis, Demeter and
Aphrodite, etc.) so too was Augustus, especially to Zeus (SEG 46.754; 47.218;
Reynolds 1996) and Apollo (Mavrojannis 1995); the stor y that Octavian's father
was Apollo himself was probably created sometime after the sea battle at Actium
(Kienast 1982: 376) and recalls similar traditions about Alexander and Seleukos. His
reluctance to accept the erection of temples to his honour can be explained by the fear
of opposition in Rome, but is also paralleled by a similar reluctance on the par t of
Hellenistic monarchs. Octavian accepted instead the construction of a temple of Dea
Roma in Pergamon (29 B C ), where he was worshipped as a synnaos theos by the
representatives of the province of Asia; the provincial emperor cult was established
later in other provinces as well and became one of the most impor tant social and
cultural institutions of the Imperial period in the Roman East. The model of a joint
cult of Roma and Augustus was also followed in Athens (19 B C ?). In other cities cult
statues of Augustus were set up in the temples of other divinities, for instance in the
temple of Zeus in Kalindoia (SEG 35.744) and of Apollo in Delos (Mavrojannis
1995). Other honours (e.g. tribes and months named after him, agons, the epithet
Soter in Athens) followed Hellenistic models. His iconography can also be seen
against the background of the iconography of Hellenistic sovereigns (La Rocca
1994), and the ceremonial context of the agons which were organized in honour of
Augustus and the later emperors can be traced back to the cult of mor tals in the
Hellenistic period (Herz 1997).
At some time between 27 B C and A D 14, still during Augustus' lifetime, the citizens
of Ioulis on Keos dedicated a building, probably a Sebasteion located near the
sanctuar y of Apollo. The dedicator y inscription states that the building was dedicated
for the well-being of Theos Kaisar Sebastos (Divus Caesar Augustus); as if it were not
strange enough that a dedication was made for the well-being of a `god' (Theos), the
dedication is addressed not only to the Olympian Gods but also to the Theoi
Sebastoi, i.e. to Divus Augustus himself and to Livia (who bears here the unof ficial
title of an Augusta). Augustus' cult is Hellenistic in this respect too: it was no less
paradoxical than the mor tal divinity of Hellenistic kings.
FURTHER READING
Sources: The evidence for ruler cult is being continually increased through new
epigraphic finds that supplement and modify our understanding of the worship of
Hellenistic kings or cer tain of its aspects. It had long been believed, e.g., that
Antigonos Gonatas did not accept divine worship, but a new find from Rhamnous
(SEG 41.75) not only demonstrated that this was the case in Athens, but also urges us
The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers 443



to reconsider other evidence as well, e.g. from Ios ( IG 12 Suppl. 168; Habicht 1996).
The new epigraphic evidence published from 1987 onwards is presented in the
Epigraphic Bulletin for Greek Religion in Kernos (6, 1991 and subsequent years).
Historical background: This has received much attention in recent years, especially
hero cult and heroization (Kearns 1989, 1992, Antonaccio 1994, Larson 1995,
L yons 1997, Johnston 1999), the predecessors of r uler cult, e.g. for L ysandros,
Amyntas III and Philip II (Habicht 1970: 3±16), the ideological/philosophical
background (PiÂ erar t 2001). The cult of Philip II now seems cer tain (Habicht 1970,
Fredricksmeyer 1981), despite the sceptical remarks of Badian 1981. In the case of
several dedications to a king Philip it is disputed whether they refer to Philip II or
Philip V (SEG 47.917, Hatzopoulos 1996: no. 78). The divinity and cult of Alexan
der the Great, the exact date of its introduction ( c. 332, 327 or later), the role of the
oracle of Ammon in Siwa, the initiative of cities, Alexander's own understanding of
his divinity and the consanguinity with Zeus, are still matters of dispute, and the
controversial statements of the sources add to the confusion (e.g. Strabo 14.1.22,
Ephippos FGrH 126 F5). To give but one example, the reciting of a Homeric verse
(Iliad 340: `ichor, that which runs in the veins of the blessed divinities') in connection
with the blood r unning from Alexander's wounds, is sometimes attributed to the
king himself, sometimes to a companion, sometimes as an (self-)ironical remark,
sometimes as flatter y (F. Jacoby, FGrH IID Kommentar: 519). New finds rarely
add something new. The cult of Hephaistion as a hero, not as a god, seems now to
be confirmed by a relief stele from Pella; it is dedicated to Hephaistion soon after his
death (late four th centur y), and the text designates him an heros (Voutiras 1990,
Despinis et al. 1997: no. 23). It is also possible that the divine honours decreed by the
Greek cities originated in Alexander's wish to introduce the posthumous cult of
Hephaistion, a wish to which the Greek cities may have responded with the joint
introduction of both Hephaistion's cult as a hero and that of Alexander as a god
(Habicht 1970: 28±36). On Alexander's divinity: Balsdon 1950, Habicht 1970,
Edmunds 1971, Fredricksmeyer 1979, Badian 1981, 1996, Cawkwell 1994. The
cult of the sovereign has, naturally, received more attention in Egypt (e.g. Lanciers
1988, Koenen 1993, Huss 1994, Bingen 1997, Melaer ts 1998, Quaegebeur 1998)
and in the Seleukid kingdom (e.g. H. Mu È ller 2000). For the cult of Antiochos I of
Kommagene, at the peripher y of the Hellenistic World: S

Schwarzer 1999.
Organization and content: The best presentation of the development and content
of the Hellenistic r uler cult is still that of fered by Habicht 1970, cf. Price 1984: 23±
53, Walbank 1987. Specific aspects, such as the festivals established by or for kings
(Hintzen-Bohlen 1992), sacrificial practices (Lanciers 1993), cult of ficials (Minas
1998 on the Kanephoros of Arsinoe II) or the archaeological evidence (Bergmann
1998, Kotsidou 2000), have been discussed in a plethora of studies. A ver y instr uctive
example of a decree establishing the royal cult is that of Teos for Antiochos III and
Laodike (SEG 41.1003; Herrmann 1965a; c. 204/3). One of the most impor tant
pieces of evidence is Kallixeinos on Ptolemy II's procession (in Athen. 5.194a-203b):
Dunand 1981, Rice 1983, KÈ ohler 1996, Walbank 1996, D. J. Thompson 2000. Its
444 Angelos Chaniotis



date is still a matter of controversy: Foertmeyer 1988, Habicht 1992, Hazzard 2000:
59±79.
Historical significance: The important part played by the poleis in the establishment
of the ruler cult has been underlined by Habicht 1970: 160±71. The integration of
the ruler cult in a system of exchange (cf. Ma 1999: 178±242, esp. 219±26)
is paralleled by the similar role of the imperial cult in the Roman East (Price 1984:
65±77). Stevenson 1996 has argued more recently that the figure of the ideal
benefactor underlies the cult of mortals in the Greco-Roman world. The early stages
of the emperor cult in Roman Egypt, especially its forerunners ± the Ptolemaic ruler
cult, the cult of Caesar, the establishment of a Kaisareion in Alexandria for Julius
Caesar ± are discussed by Grenier 1995, Fishwick 1987, Heinen 1995, Huzar 1995,
and Ruggendorfer 1996. Useful overviews of the cult of Augustus are presented by
Kienast 1982: 202±14 and Clauss 1999; cf. Fishwick 1987±92, Bosworth 1999. For
a detailed bibliography on this subject, Krause et al. 1998: 399±412. Clauss 1996
argues that Julius Caesar and Augustus were regarded as gods during their lifetime
not only in the eastern provinces, but also in the western part of the Empire, even in
Rome. The origins of the emperor cult in Asia Minor have been recently illuminated
by a series of studies by Campanile (1993, 1994a, 1994b); cf. S. Price 1984, Friesen
1993, Herrmann 1994. Among other areas, the cult of Augustus in Athens has
received much attention, because of the abundance of sources: Clinton 1997, Mav
rojannis 1995, Hoff 1996, Spawforth 1997. A very interesting aspect of Hellenistic
and Imperial ruler cult is the adventus of the monarch: Lehnen 1997; it is possible
that the ceremonial adventus has influenced early Christian liturgy (K. Berger 1991).

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Empires of Knowledge:
Medicine and Health in the
Hellenistic World
Rebecca Flemming
It has become commonplace in a range of disciplines ± in (at least par ts of) histor y and
literar y studies, for instance, as well as anthropology and sociology ± to approach
empire as a type of knowledge project. `Colonial knowledge both enabled conquest
and was produced by it', states historical anthropologist Nicholas Dirks, `in cer tain
ways knowledge was what colonialism was all about' (1996: ix). The point is, in a
sense, an obvious one. Successful conquerors need not just militar y strength and
organization, together with some political skills, but also intelligence. Conquest itself
is a learning process, both for the victors and the vanquished, and this feeds into the
system of domination which is then established and consolidated. The management
of knowledge ± its continued but controlled generation, its rightful ordering, dif fer
ential possession, and ongoing productivity ± counts amongst the most vital tech
nologies of colonial rule. It may also become a site of resistance.
The principle is generally illustrated with examples from the `Grand Era' of Euro
pean imperialism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Here, as Canadian
historian Ruth Roach Pierson points out:
Hand-in-hand with European conquerors, explorers, slave traders, merchants, mission
aries, and imperial and colonial administrators, European car tographers, botanists,
biologists, and budding anthropologists fanned out over the globe, returning home
with the booty that fueled the mania for classification and categorization. These were at
the hear t of the great urge to control, the will to power, through the creation of a `new
global order of cultural knowledge' . . . (Pierson 1998: 3; citing McClintock 1995: 3)
Thus the histories of these scientific, or more broadly scholarly, disciplines (and
others such as geology and geography) in this period, their institutions and heroes,
are increasingly written as a par t of European imperial histor y (e.g. Brockway 1979;
Staf ford 1989; Gascoigne 1998). It is, moreover, precisely in these centuries that
these subjects really took of f: expanding with the empires that needed and sustained



them, and establishing themselves in something like their modern forms. Western
medicine also has a deeply imperialist past. It too par ticipated in the extension and
consolidation of systems of European international domination, and a host of studies
have tracked, described and analysed the multifarious forms of this par ticipation (e.g.
Arnold 1988; MacLeod and Lewis 1988).
There are also obvious resonances with the Hellenistic world, though scholars have
been reluctant to use words like `colonial', and even `imperial', in this context.
Alexander the Great was accompanied on his campaigns by sur veyors, physicians,
historians and philosophers; indeed it might be argued that the desire to know,
inter twined as it was with the will to power, formed a key par t of his pothos. Even
discarding the Roman encyclopaedist Pliny the Elder's much later stor y of his
systematic collection of animal specimens for Aristotle's study (HN 8.17), it is clear
that Alexander's conquests greatly increased the range and reper tor y of Greek natural
histor y. Many descriptions of exotic lands and peoples are also traced back to the
companions of Alexander, such as Nearchos (Arr. Anab. 7; Pliny HN 6.21). More
over, this is just the beginning of the explosion in, and systematization of, knowledge
that marks the Hellenistic period. This is, after all, the age of mathematicians such as
Euklid and Archimedes of Syracuse (whose mechanical interests also overlapped with
those of men such as Ktesibos of Alexandria), and of Aristarchos of Samos with his
heliocentric model of the cosmos. It is the era of the formation of significant new
philosophical schools, and of the creation of various literar y corpora and canons; not
to mention the medical developments that are the focus of this paper.
The explanations of fered for this ef florescence of learning cer tainly make reference
to the geo-political situation created by Alexander's acquisition of empire, followed
by its break-up into the Successor Kingdoms, but in a somewhat muted, even
euphemistic, manner. The eminent student of Greek scientific enterprise, G. E. R.
Lloyd, for example, speaks of `a cer tain widening of the mental horizons', as `closer
intellectual and cultural contacts between Greeks and Barbarians became possible'
(Lloyd 1973: 2). He also emphasizes the impor tance of kingly patronage to Hellen
istic science (Lloyd 1973: 3±5), a theme which others have also picked up on and
elaborated. It is, however, not just monarchy that is at issue here, but empire.
Horizons have been widened by conquest ± by territorial expansion and the subjuga
tion of other peoples ± and the contact between `Greeks and Barbarians' was, at a
basic level, contact between victor and vanquished, ruler and ruled; not a neutral,
even-handed af fair. The par ticular shape the Hellenistic world settled into after the
death of Alexander, and the subsequent division of spoils, diverges in a number of
impor tant respects from the world of eighteenth- and nineteenth centur y imperial
ism; but it also shares cer tain features of no less significance.
The point is not just a moral one, but also one of understanding. If we place the
considerable developments in medical knowledge during the Hellenistic era in a more
explicitly imperialist framework than hither to, and make use of the various insights
about the intimate relations between knowledge and empire gained from other
periods in histor y, might it not help us to understand the phenomena rather better?
That is what I propose to find out in this account of Hellenistic medicine. Caution
will, of course, be needed in implementing such a comparative approach. The
intention is cer tainly not simply to adopt models from the extensive scholarship on
`colonial' or `imperial' medicine, focused as it is on the par ticularities of the modern

era; but rather to benefit from the ways in which these discussions have recently been
both broadened out to deal with issues of power and culture, domination and
discourse, in more inclusive ways, and have become more sensitive to various specifi
cities and complexities of context.
1 Bodies of Medical Knowledge/Imperial Knowledge
The medical development which dominates most discussions of scientific endeavours
in the Hellenistic period is, of course, the introduction (and conclusion) of the practice
of systematic human dissection (and vivisection) in early third-centur y Alexandria. This
anatomical moment ± which is coterminous with the careers of just two men, Her
ophilos of Chalkedon and Erasistratos of Ioulis on Keos ± has perhaps gained more
impor tance in the histor y of medicine from the defining role that the dissection of
human cadavers has played (and rather surprisingly still plays) in the self-identity of
modern medicine and its practitioners, than from any consideration of its more
immediate ef fects. None the less, it cer tainly counts as a moment in which classical
medical knowledge (if not practice) was transformed. The rather loosely conceived,
and imaginative, approach to the human interior which characterizes the writings of
the Hippocratic Corpus, had up till now been supplemented and steadied only by
the comparative anatomy of Aristotle, and others who dissected animals. In early
Ptolemaic Alexandria, this figuration was decisively overlaid with a detailed description
of each human par t, `its position, colour, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness,
smoothness, interrelationships, processes and depressions, and whether any par t is
inser ted into or receives another par t' (Celsus Med. pr.24). Names were given to each
feature discovered, and, though the actual works of the Alexandrian anatomists have
been lost, their terminology ± par ticularly that of Herophilos ± proved much more
resilient. Even today, various bodily items still bear their Herophilean monikers, albeit
in a Latinized form, such as the terms `cornea' (`horn-like', from keratoeides, Rufus
Onom. 12±13) and `retina' (`net-like', from amphiblestroeides: Rufus Onom. 153), for
two of the four tunics of the eye which Herophilos was the first to identify.
The amount of knowledge about the human body was thus vastly increased, as
befits the imperial setting; but the ef fects this had on the understanding of how the
body worked, fell ill and was cured were rather less dramatic, and ser ve (along with
various other complications) to give this imperialist theme a par ticular shape and
stress. Some aspects of somatic formation and functioning did come more clearly into
focus. One of Herophilos' major achievements, for example, was identifying the
ner ves as distinct entities, separate from the ar teries and veins, if not always from
various sinews and tendons. Both he and Erasistratos further distinguished between
sensor y and motor ner ves, though they diverged on which par ts of the brain and
spine constitute the origin, or centre, of these systems. This allowed a clear dif feren
tiation to be made between involuntar y motions based on the ar teries ± primarily the
pulse, a subject on which Herophilos was also ver y influential ± and voluntar y motion
involving the ner ves and muscles; a dif ferentiation which could then take a patho
logical form. As Galen, the great physician of the Roman imperial era whose copious
(but far from disinterested) writings provide much of the evidence for earlier medical
theories and practices, explains it, Herophilos held that the disease cluster of tremor,
palpitation and spasm were all diseases of the operation of voluntar y movement, and
Medicine and Health 451



so affections of the ner ves, not the ar teries, as his teacher, Praxagoras of Kos, had
argued (Gal. Trem. Palp. 5: 7.605±6 K). However, the practical ramifications of this
pathological reassignment are hard to detect. There seems, for example, to be little
therapeutic response to the new conceptualization.
Moreover there is still the underlying question of what causes these problems: what
so badly af fects the ner ves so as to result in this dysfunction of voluntar y motion,
these tremors, palpitations and spasms? Here teacher and pupil seem to have been in
agreement, not only with each other but with established Hippocratic doctrine too.
As a later medical handbook ascribed to Galen explains:
Some people attributed both the constitution of things that are in accordance with
nature and the causes of things which are contrar y to nature to the humours alone, as
did Praxagoras and Herophilos. ([Gal.] Intro. 9: 14.698±9 K)
And Galen himself describes this as `emulating' Hippokrates (Gal.PHP 8.5.24: CMG
5.4.1.2 510.1±5). Despite all his anatomical discoveries, the accuracy and detail of his
innovative topographical descriptions of the human interior, therefore, Herophilos
remained committed to a ver y traditional understanding of health (which is always in
accordance with nature) and disease (which is the contrar y condition); one that was
based on age-old notions of balance and imbalance, manifested in the humoural
mixture of the body. This is, fur thermore, a conception which operates at a ver y
general level of somatic organization, not a more anatomically specific one. It is about
the fluids ± the humours ± that per vade the whole body rather than being tied to any
specific location or organ.
Erasistratos, on the other hand, did break with Hippocratic tradition, and in a
manner that was clearly related to the new anatomy. He took the separation of the
three somatic networks ± arteries, veins and ner ves ± a step fur ther than Herophilos
by separating out also the substances they transpor ted around the body. Most
controversially, Erasistratos confined blood (considered in ancient medical thought
to per form a nourishing role) to the veins, asser ting that the arteries contained only
vital pneuma, that is pneuma (warm air that became integral to bodily functioning)
which simply sustains life, whereas the pneuma in the ner ves was implicated in
perception and action. For him then, all disease was caused by the `transference of
blood into the arteries' ([Gal.] Intro. 13: 14.728±9 K); that is by the break down of
this systemic and substantial division. There was also a ver y clear therapeutic conse
quence of all this. Erasistratos was opposed to blood-letting, that most fundamental
feature of the ancient curative armour y from the Hellenistic era onwards.
Even Erasistratos, however, left many of the key assumptions and basic understand
ings of the medical tradition he inherited entirely intact. He, and indeed Herophilos,
may have provided some new answers to old questions, but they rarely thought to
change the questions, or challenge the set of presumptions from which they arose.
Indeed, to some extent the newness of their answers was a matter of detail and
precision, of the kind of extended account which could now be given with their
recently acquired anatomical knowledge; rather than any more dramatic innovation.
This, and the general failure of these developments to deliver any obvious therapeutic
results, has all been a considerable disappointment to many modern commentators,
par ticularly those most committed to the inherently, and intensely, revelator y powers
452 Rebecca Flemming



of human dissection. But, as well as of fering a salutar y lesson in the general limita
tions of empirical knowledge of this type, there is a more specific surprise in this
conceptual conser vatism. For the undertaking of systematic human dissection for the
first time was a radical one, and did entail breaking with traditions of a rather
stronger, more socially and religiously entrenched, variety than those which shaped
the medical community as such. The inhibitions against opening up the human body
were bound up with a number of deep cultural commitments and long-standing
practices relating to life and death, the proper treatment of the corpse and its
polluting proper ties, and the integrity and aesthetic qualities of the body. They
were, moreover, only briefly overcome. Why then did the boldness that took these
men through these barriers not carr y right through their research? What, indeed,
made them want to anatomize at all, if it had so few tangible results, and seems so
incidental to the wider medical enterprise?
This apparent paradox would be resolved if it were the ideological rather than the
practical results of the new human anatomy that were of primar y concern here; if it
were the simple desire to bring knowledge of the human body decisively within the
estate of the medical ar t ± a move hinted at by Hippocratic speculations and Aristo
telian animal dissections ± which was crucial in this case, without any particular
consideration of the precise therapeutic rewards that might be reaped from this
conquest, or even of the exact way the newly won territor y would relate to the
existing hear tlands. The somatic interior invited capture: to be able to claim master y
over it was a goal in itself, the achievement of which would both bring glor y to those
responsible and give strength to the medical ar t more generally.
This is, obviously, to implicate Herophilos and Erasistratos more directly in the
imperialism of their age than most scholars have been inclined to do hitherto; and it is
all highly speculative, as any discussion of their motivations, and indeed many of their
activities, must be in the absence of their own works, or any contemporar y repor ts.
However, it is an interpretation which fits in well with the other factors that are
invoked to explain this ancient anatomical moment. For the most important of these
all relate to the political realities of the world shaped by Alexander's conquests. First
there is the moral and practical suppor t offered by the early Ptolemies ± in the shape
of `condemned men, provided alive by the kings from prison' (CelsusMed. pr.23±4)
to cut open and inspect while still breathing ± as part of their attempt to establish
Alexandria as a centre of cultural achievement. The culture in question was, of course,
Greek, the culture of the conquerors, and its promotion was about legitimizing the
new ruling dynasty, providing the Ptolemies with more than just a militar y basis for
their regime. Second there is their success in attracting an intelligentsia, drawn from
all over the Greek world, and committed to innovation and enterprise in both
sciences and letters. The first two Ptolemies invested substantial amounts of the
wealth they acquired with their empire in cultural projects, establishing the Librar y
and the Museum to this end; and though there is nothing to link Herophilos or
Erasistratos directly with either, the fact that the boundaries of knowledge and
literature were being extended all around them surely had some indirect effects.
Third there are the ways in which the newness of the city itself, its `frontier' qualities,
added to the adventurous brew (von Staden 1992: 232). Alexandria was the first
of Alexander's city foundations, and, in many ways, the foremost herald of his new
order.
Medicine and Health 453



The explanator y emphasis in all this is clearly, if not explicitly, on the colonial
situation in Hellenistic Egypt (par ticularly in its early phases) as intellectually and
imaginatively enabling for the colonizers. Cultural life, including scientific enquir y,
was par t of the consolidation of empire. It was the continuation of territorial expan
sion by other means, the expression of the superiority of the rulers over both their
subject peoples and rival Macedonian regimes. This expression was, moreover, invig
orated as well as necessitated, by the colonial encounter with dif ference and novelty,
by the challenge and freedom of living `on the frontier', among non-Greeks. And,
even if the suggestion that human dissection might have taken either techniques or
permission from native Egyptian practices or beliefs, par ticularly from mummifica
tion, is currently out of favour, there is another direct contribution the Egyptian
population could have made to these researches. Rather surprisingly, no one has yet
speculated about the ethnic identity of those criminals who were provided by
the Ptolemies from their prisons to be vivisected. Instead the debate has focused on
the impossibility of `civilized' Greeks behaving in such a barbaric manner, despite the
unequivocal repor ts to the contrar y of a number of reasonably reliable, though
cer tainly not contemporar y, witnesses, such as the early imperial Latin writer Celsus.
This `argument from inconceivability' has now fallen into disrepute, as the cruelties
practised by the Greeks in a range of areas, including their judicial and penal systems,
have come more to prominence in the scholarship (a relevant example here is
Boswor th 1996). But would it not have made the Ptolemies' task easier if the
condemned men they were handing over to this terrible fate were Egyptians not
Greeks or Macedonians?
It should be added immediately that, whether or not this was the case, the anatomy
of Herophilos and Erasistratos was not an anatomy of dif ference. There is no indica
tion that they dissected, as some of their nineteenth-centur y successors did (e.g.
Stepan 1982), in order to distinguish between varieties of human being, to provide
interior confirmation and meanings for a racial hierarchy. Indeed, their approach to
the one dif ference they were clearly concerned with ± that between women and men ±
appears to be one which brings the two closer together rather than pushing them
fur ther apar t. One of the more substantial sur viving quotes from Herophilos'Anat
omy, contained in a work of Galen, opens: `On the uterus, growing out sideways, one
from each par t, are the didymoi (literally ``twins'' but here ``testicles''), and they dif fer
only a little from those of males' (Gal. Sem. 2.1.15: CMG 5.3.1 146.22±4). Nor does
the similarity between male and female end with them both possessing testicles
(though not, it should be said, contributing equally to the formation of of fspring);
both Herophilos and Erasistratos held, in their own distinct ways, that female bodies
were composed from the same stuf f as male ones, worked and failed in the same way,
and so that there were no diseases peculiar to women, nor cures (Sor. Gyn. 3.1;
Flemming 2000).
The final area that benefits from this more imperialist reading of Hellenistic
anatomy is, appropriately, its end. For, despite various suggestions to the contrar y
(e.g. Edelstein 1967), there is no evidence that either human vivisection or dissection
continued after the lifetimes of Herophilos and Erasistratos (most cogently argued in
von Staden 1989 and 1992). This is, in large par t, seen as a reversion to normality, as
traditional values and behaviours dominate once more after the initial dynamism, the
early pioneering period, of Ptolemaic rule fades away. These traditional values being,
454 Rebecca Flemming



it is fur ther stressed, now not just Greek or Macedonian, but Egyptian too, as native
culture has reasser ted itself, becoming, along with various sections of the Egyptian
elite, of more concern to successive Ptolemies as the new order beds down. There is
much to recommend this basic understanding, but thinking about anatomizing as
conquest helps the process of reversion. For conquest is not something that needs to
be repeated. It is, by definition, a one-of f occurrence, though often the platform for
fur ther developments. Once the knowledge of the body has been won ± the territor y
mapped and named ± then that is the end of it, though it may be the beginning of
something else. In these terms, human vivisection and dissection thus came to its
natural conclusion as Herophilos and Erasistratos completed their project. The terms
had changed, however, by the time that men like Galen and Rufus of Ephesos
(explicitly or implicitly) regret their inability to open up the human body (Gal. AA
1.2: 2.218±27 K; Rufus Onom. 10), several centuries, and many shifts in the medical
(not to mention political and cultural) situation, later.
One such medical shift is also to be located in Hellenistic Alexandria, and both
emerges out of and helps terminate its anatomical moment. It is, fur thermore, a
development that has received considerable scholarly attention in its own right (e.g.
von Staden 1982, and Hankinson 1995, for two dif ferent kinds of scholarly treat
ment). That is the inauguration of medical sects, based on epistemological divisions
of the medical ar t. The link with anatomy is twofold. First, and most personally, it is
when a pupil of Herophilos ± Philinos of Kos ± left his teacher's circle to initiate the
foundation of a rival school or sect (hairesis) which developed a different conception
of the medical ar t, that the Hellenistic phase of the debate about what constituted
medical knowledge ± about where the boundaries of relevance, utility and necessity
lie, and about what qualifies as knowledge ± took a sharper, definitional and organiza
tional turn. The new grouping launched by Philinos became known as theempirikoi
or `empiricists', and those they had broken with, such as those around Herophilos
and Erasistratos, were characterized, almost by default, as the logikoi or `rationalists'.
The epistemological dichotomy which thus cr ystallized has been summarized by
philosopher Michael Frede:
Ver y roughly speaking, the empiricists were called `empiricists' since they took the view
that knowledge is just a matter of a cer tain kind of complex experience (in Greek
empeira), whereas the rationalists were so called since they assumed that mere experience,
however complex, does not amount to knowledge, that knowledge crucially involves the
use of reason (logos in Greek, ratio in Latin), for example to provide the appropriate kind
of justification for our belief. (Frede 1990: 225)
Second, while complex experience encompassed incidental examination of the bodily
interior, when confronted, for example, by someone who needed treatment for
having been cut open by a sword, systematic dissection and vivisection fell outside
this categor y. According to Celsus, the empiricists held that these activities were not
only useless and unnecessar y, but also, at least in the case of vivisection, cruel ( Med.
pr. 40±4). For nothing is more foolish than assuming that the human body remains
the same during this kind of inter vention, through dying and death, when it is, after
all, living bodies and their repair which are of real interest to doctors. What they need
to know, therefore, is what treatment has been beneficial for which pathological
Medicine and Health 455



condition in the past, based primarily on their own obser vation, and on the critical
assimilation of the repor ts of others.
It is possible, therefore, to see empiricism as a complex response to the new
anatomy, based in par t on ethical considerations, but also on the extrinsic qualities
of the knowledge which had been produced. All that was resting on this detailed
topographical understanding of the somatic interior was a broad claim to medical
authority, nothing more specific than that; and that was a claim which could be
anchored elsewhere, in experience and histor y. Both factors, as well as the continuing
drive to innovate, to dif ferentiate oneself from other physicians and their ideas in the
continuing competition for patients and pupils that characterized classical medicine,
suggested that this kind of anatomy be rejected, and contributed to the demise of
human dissection (see esp. von Staden 1992 for this latter point). It is harder to see
any more directly imperialist motivation in this move, in this epistemological division
of the medical landscape, prefigured as it was by dif ferences in the Hippocratic
Corpus. Though it might perhaps be speculated that the totalizing aspect of the
empiricist vision, the sense in which their definition of the knowledge requisite to the
medical endeavour coincided with their definition of knowledge per se owed some
thing to the totalizing vision of empire, to the scale and ambition of the Greek world
of Alexander. Division and competition were also, of course, facts of political life
thereafter.
At least one empiricist was also associated with the later Ptolemaic cour t. The
commentar y on the Hippocratic treatise On Joints by Apollonios of Kition is the only
Hellenistic medical treatise to sur vive intact, and each of its three books opens with an
address to King Ptolemy, on whose orders the work was under taken. The Ptolemy in
question is generally held to be Auletes, who reigned from 80 to 51 B C , thus
demonstrating the long-term success of Philinos' sectarian foundation. More impor t
ant to the theoretical development of empiricism, however, are figures like Serapion
of Alexandria, Philinos' successor and the man generally credited with establishing
the sect's main tenets, and Herakleides of Tarentum, who repeated Philinos' original
apostasy, leaving the school of Herophilos for the ranks of the empirikoi in the early
first centur y B C . This shows, in addition, the continuing vitality of the Herophilean
lineage itself, though, unable to continue opening up human bodies, they largely
`turned their backs on anatomy' (von Staden 1989: 446), and diversified into other
areas, several of which ± such as pharmacology, surger y and Hippocratic philology
and exegesis ± were also of much interest to the empiricists, and tied in with some
broader cultural movements too. The followers of Erasistratos were an identifiable
group throughout the Hellenistic age also, though they too seem to have neglected
anatomy while remaining committed to the basic tenets of Erasistratos' physiology,
pathology and therapeutics, as Galen's polemics against the Erasistrateans active in
the Rome of his day emphasize (Gal. Ven. Sect. Er. Rom. 11: 187±244 K; and see
Brain 1986).
When exactly the first Erasistrateans reached Rome is unknown ± it may have
been not till after Actium. If so, they were beaten to the capital of this new Mediterra
nean power, this new empire, by a physician who appears to have taken some of
Erasistratos' ideas a good deal fur ther than any of his followers. Asklepiades of Prusias
in Bithynia, arrived in Rome in the later par t of the second centur y B C , and seems to
have been remarkably successful there in his promulgation both of innovative theories
456 Rebecca Flemming



about the human being in sickness and health, and an original (though less dramatic
ally so) therapeutic package to accompany them. He argued that the human body
(like the rest of the cosmos) was constructed out of fundamental (but frangible)
particles which percolated through the body in various passages or pores. Their
balanced, free-flowing movement constituted health, and their impaction in the
passages, with resultant blockage, was the sole cause of disease. His curative prescrip
tions were notoriously gentle, based on `passive exercise' (such as being rocked in a
hammock), baths, massage, drinking wine and water, or occasionally abstaining from
the same, or even food. All of these are elements of traditional dietetics, albeit
sometimes rather minor ones, but re-formulated, and given different emphases and
explanations in a more selective package.
The pleasant qualities of Asklepiades' cures have been suggested as the key to his
spectacular success (see e.g. Pliny HN 7.124, and also 26.12±17). There may well be
something to the allegation, but Asklepiades also won many adherents to his theor
etical positions. Dioscorides, writing his highly influential work on medical materials
in the late first centur y A D , includes a list of recent pharmacological authors in his
preface, and they are Asclepiadeans to a man (Materia medica pr. 2). Like Herophilos
before him, however, Asklepiades suf fered an early, and significant, defection from the
ranks of his followers. His pupil Themison of Laodikeia gradually separated himself
from his teacher, and formulated an alternative `method' of medicine, centred on the
obser vation of cer tain common characteristics of disease (`stricture', `flux', and
`mixture'), which a physician needs to be able to recognize in any sick individual
and take as, in themselves, indicative of their treatment (so that, for example,
`stricture' requires relaxing, and so for th). These notions formed the core commit
ments of the `methodist sect', which flourished in the Roman imperial era.
2 Medicines for an Empire
The Asclepiadean interest in medical materials followed on from a general increase in
the attention devoted to this area of healing practice, not only by the medical
community as a whole, but the wider literate population too. Pharmacology entered
the Hellenistic era consisting mainly of simples ± that is of drugs derived from a single
active ingredient, whether animal, vegetable or mineral ± and left it dominated by
compound drugs, often involving lengthy lists of ingredients. Herophilos himself
called medicaments the `hands of the gods' (Scribon. Comp. Ep. 1), and many of his
followers zealously pursued his lead. One ± Mantias ± is indeed credited with
founding the compound drug tradition, and it is his errant pupil, Herakleides of
Tarentum, who heads the roll-call of respected Empiricist writers on pharmacology.
Other notable contributors to Hellenistic drug-lore, such as Iollas of Bithynia and
Krateuas the Root-cutter (or Rhizotomist, that is a medical practitioner located in a
strongly plant-based tradition of healing), operated outside any particular medical
lineage or sectarian grouping. But it was not just the number of items that might go
into a remedy which increased at this time, the number of items that might be
therapeutically called on in any way dramatically expanded, and in some particular
directions, bringing the imperialist theme to the fore again. Prior to Alexander's
conquests, cultural and economic contacts around the Eastern Mediterranean had
already infiltrated a number of `Egyptian', `Indian', and other exotic ingredients into
Medicine and Health 457



Greek drug-lore; and this process of assimilation massively increased in the Hellenistic
period.
This assimilation was about more than simply expanding the pharmaceutical reper
toire of Greek medicine; it also helped to bring order to the contents of the newly
conquered territories, to generate and manage knowledge about their flora, fauna
and minerals, in acceptable and familiar ways. The plants, animals and stones of the
Hellenistic world could be pharmacologically mapped and organized, and so brought
into a beneficial relationship with humanity, and its Greek por tion in par ticular, as this
organization occurred around an established Greek centre, taking Greek literar y
forms. The dietetic aspects of these things could also be treated in the same way,
thus incorporating new foodstuf fs within existing, and distinctively Greek, patterns of
understanding and evaluation; a task which seems to have begun in the age of the
Diadochoi themselves, as Diphilos of Siphnos' workOn Foodstuf fs dates, according to
Athenaeus who cites it extensively, `to the age of L ysimachos' (2.51a). Another
contribution to the same enterprise, one that found par ticular favour outside the
strictly medical arena, was writing on poisonous (or at least dangerous) animals,
plants and some minerals, together with remedial responses to them. New threats
were thus placed alongside the old, and, as far as possible, matched with antidotes.
The only sur viving examples of this rich Hellenistic genre are the twin didactic poems
on the subject ± the Theriaka and Alexipharmaka ± composed by Nikander of
Kolophon, probably in second-centur y B C Pergamon. His main inspiration is thought
to have come from one Apollodoros, who wrote similar works in early third-centur y
B C Alexandria; but the Herophilean Andreas also wrote a treatise On Poisonous
Animals later in the same centur y, and a series of more medical as well as poetic
successors are known.
Poisons and their antidotes were, of course, a par ticular preoccupation within
ruling circles, and royal patronage undoubtedly played a role in the rise, and shape,
of Hellenistic pharmacology. Andreas is, for example, one of the few Herophileans
who can be directly linked to the Ptolemaic cour t, indeed he even managed to get
himself killed in place of his king ± Ptolemy IV Philopator ± on the eve of the battle of
Raphia in 217 B C (Polyb. 5.81.6). Krateuas the Root-cutter is generally associated
with the king of antidotes, Mithradates VI of Pontos himself. Not, it should be said,
with the monarch's testing of possibly poison nullifying substances on criminals
condemned to death (presumably by poison), a practice which had apparently been
pioneered by Attalos III of Pergamon before him (Justin also has Attalos experi
menting likewise on his `friends': 36.4.3), but perhaps with Mithradates' wider
medical investigations. Pliny the Elder explicitly aligns these with the king's position
as conqueror and colonial ruler, and has him collecting medical information from `all
his subjects, who comprised a great par t of the world' (HN 25.5±7). Pliny also
mentions an antidote favoured by Antiochos the Great against all poisonous creatures
except the asp (HN 20.264), and one of that monarch's physicians ± Apollophanes of
Seleukeia ± may have been famous for his plasters (a kind of externally applied
medicament) as well as his political activity (see e.g. Gal. Comp. Med. Loc. 8.9 and
Comp. Med. Gen. 7.7: 13.220 and 979 K; as well as Polyb. 5.56 and 5.58±61, though
the name alone is not enough to prove identity). Doctors from the Antigonid cour t
seem to have had the least impact on the historical and medical record, but Celsus
(7.21.3) describes one such (whose name is unfortunately lost to us) as `a not
458 Rebecca Flemming



undistinguished physician, a pupil of Chr ysippos' (perhaps Chr ysippos of Knidos,
the teacher of Erasistratos, or, if chronology requires it, the Chr ysippos whom
Erasistratos himself taught: D.L. 7.186). Following Alexander's precedent, not to
mention various more practical impulses, therefore, ever y Hellenistic dynasty in
cluded physicians within their cour tly circles, and drew them from all over the
Greek world.
Returning, however, to the par ticular environs of the Pontic cour t, the figure of
Krateuas illuminates other features of the Hellenistic medical landscape. Though the
reputation of his work is better attested than its contents, the indications are that he
distanced himself from some of the murkier aspects of classical Greekrhizotomia, from
the kind of root-cutting associated, for example, with the sorceress Medea (Macrob.
Sat. 5.19.10). Rather than paying attention to rituals of cutting ± per forming the task
by the new or full moon, for instance, with (or without) special implements, having
purified or other wise prepared oneself ± Krateuas seems to have concentrated on the
plants themselves; on how to identify them (for which purpose illustrations were
provided), and their properties. Some of these properties might be classified as
`wonder ful', such as the ability of the plant onothuris to calm all fierce animals
when sprinkled with wine (Pliny HN 22.167), but most are more mundane, such
as Krateuas' prescription of lettuce juice for dropsy (HN 20.63). Similarly mar vellous
powers of things can also be found in Nikander, in the Hellenistic paradoxographers,
and in a related literar y genre which took this kind of folklore in a dif ferent direction.
This is the development of a literature of learned magic, a literature full of this kind of
information ± about plants such as the ophiusa from Elephantine and the thalassaegle
of the Indus which both cause visions and derangement, or the Persian planthestia
teris that produces conviviality and promotion at cour t (HN 24.163±5) ± but which
frames it in a ver y par ticular fashion. The data is presented as wisdom derived, not
from local root-cutters, but from more exotic and prestigious sources, most especially
the magi of Persia, but also, for example, Egyptian priests and kings. Its transmission
from these foreign quar ters into Greek forms is then ascribed either to a hellenized
sage of some kind, or to a Greek philosopher ± usually Demokritos or Pythagoras ±
who traf ficked with the pur veyors of Eastern learning. It was these specific names that
two of the chief architects of this new magical literature ± Bolos of Mendes (probably
active in the early second centur y B C ) and Kleemporos the physician (of uncer tain
date) ± chose, respectively, to write under.
The overlap of content, and also form, between these organized catalogues of the
magical proper ties of various natural substances ± plants, animals and minerals ± and
medical writings is obvious, even without Kleemporos' professional designation.
None the less, the bir th and growth of this literar y genre, this expansion in occult
knowledge about nature, is often seen as standing in contrast with, if not opposition
to, the more rationalistic medical developments outlined so far. It is, however, put
down to the same causes: the broadening of horizons and monarchic structures of the
Hellenistic world. There was, it is argued, a critical loss of confidence, of the `special
sor t of confidence that only self-determination can produce' (Green 1990: 53), as a
result of the rise of Macedonian monarchy, allied with a general dislocation and
disorientation as old institutions and patterns of organization gave way to the new.
To allay these anxieties Greeks either turned inwards, following the teachings of new
Hellenistic philosophies to a fulfilment based on individual conduct rather than
Medicine and Health 459



community par ticipation, or turned fur ther outwards, beyond the boundaries of civic
religion or established reason, to myster y cults, magic and astrology.
Now it may be that Hellenistic monarchy is big enough to hold both elaborate
discourses of rationality and irrationality in its embrace, to contain both supreme
confidence and a loss of ner ve. Indeed it is possible that an over whelming rationalism
will inevitably produce its opposite, or that the sectarian disputes of the third centur y
B C fuelled a search for alternative approaches. Overall, however, these contrasts seem
too sharply drawn, the picture constructed seems too simple given the many factors
involved, and the considerable continuities evident between the Classical and Hellen
istic eras. Cer tainly the development of bodies of occult knowledge about nature can
be seen as the extension of methods of organization, of systematization, established in
more `rational' areas of natural knowledge, rather than their contradiction. Both
Bolos and Krateuas, for example, par ticipate in the discourse of dynameis, of deter
mining and describing the powers or properties naturally inherent in things, a
concept that has Aristotelian connections amongst others. They simply place the
emphasis dif ferently, both from each other and from others who use the same
explanator y mechanism. Bolos is most interested in the more mar vellous powers of
things, Krateuas in their healing properties; others, like Herophilos, in thedynameis
of various bodily organs, or indeed of the human body itself. Just as widely shared was
the notion of sympathy and antipathy which provides the other explicator y thread in
the world of natural magic. Indeed, one of Bolos' pseudo-Demokritean creations was
called alternatively, Natural Properties or On Sympathies and Antipathies (Suda
B482); and the two concepts are clearly inter twined as it is, for example, in the nature
of menstruating women to be lethally antipathetic to caterpillars (Columella
11.3.64). Again, however, there is a shift of emphasis from the sympathy evoked in
Stoicism and medical writings (where there are sympathetic connections between
par ts of the body which may find pathological expressions of various kinds), to the
antipathy that appears to dominate the more magical works. Still, it is a commitment
to the interconnectedness, the ordering, of all things which underlies both.
By invoking these explanator y mechanisms, men such as Bolos and Kleemporos
are, as the classical scholar Richard Gordon has suggested (1997), attempting to
rationalize pre-existing Greek practices, embedded in a set of almost entirely tacit
assumptions and understandings. They are, ef fectively, taking established folk trad
itions, expanding them, placing them in an explicator y framework formed out of
strands of current thinking about how things work, interrelate and interact, and
dressing them up in exotic clothes ± the clothes of ancient Eastern and Egyptian
learning. For, though Greek borrowing from Babylonian and Egyptian astronomy
and astrology is reasonably clear, even if the precise path to, and date of, this merging
of traditions remains a matter of debate, the suggestions of a comparable process
in the more ear thly realms of knowledge are much weaker and less convincing
(M. Dickie 1999: 183±9 has to work much too hard to make the connections he
wants in this respect; see also M. Dickie 2001: 120±4 for astrological comparisons).
So it is the clothes alone that are borrowed here, and even these are more like
theatrical costumes than authentic attire.
The benefits of such an authorial strategy are obvious. In laying claim not only to
the names of Demokritos and Pythagoras, but also to the wisdom of Zoroaster and
the magi, of Egyptian priests, kings and gods, these texts laid claim to both an
460 Rebecca Flemming



authority and a novelty they other wise lacked. That authority was at once philosoph
ical and religious, rational and mystical, rooted inside and outside established trad
ition. Nor did the benefits accrue solely to the authors themselves: the works thus
framed gave the recently conquered but venerable cultures of the Achaimenid Empire
a place in the new world order, just as they gave the recently arrived Greeks a place in
the old. The subordinate position of this ancient wisdom was clear ± it lay under
neath, behind, an invigorated extension of Greek learning ± and, by translating
dif ference into an exotic colouring for the familiar, it also provided justificator y
`roots' for Greek settlement in the new territories, a legitimating lineage for the
consolidation of conquest. To conclude from this growth of orientalist pseudepigra
phica, as ancient historian Arnaldo Momigliano did in his fundamental study of `alien
wisdom', that Hellenistic civilization `had all the marks of a conquering and ruling
upper class ± except faith in its own wisdom' (1975: 149) is, therefore, seriously to
misconstrue the meaning of this discourse (as well as seriously overrating its impor t
ance). It was ver y much a par t of, not at odds with, a discourse of domination, as self
ser ving as any other imperialist interpretation of the cultural traditions of colonized
(or other wise dominated) peoples, regardless of their enviable antiquity or spiritual
strengths.
Bolos, Krateuas, Nikander, Andreas and Herakleides can all be seen, along with
Herophilos, Erasistratos, and many others, as contributing to the `new global order
of cultural knowledge' that was an integral par t of the formation and maintenance of
the Hellenistic world. That is not all they did, and their contributions were not
identical; but each had something to of fer, and each took from, and was suppor ted
by, his political, social, economic and ideological context in his work. One final, but
undoubtedly significant, medical development of the Hellenistic period is of a rather
dif ferent character, however. This is the rise of the cult of Asklepios, the most
specialized healing deity in the Greek pantheon, and the associated increase in the
emphasis on, and attention paid to, the Asklepios-like curative and more generally
protective powers of various other divinities, both old and new. This phenomenon is
not primarily an expansion of knowledge, distinguishing it from the other develop
ments discussed so far; but there are epistemic elements to the improvement in the
for tunes of divine healing, along with the obvious elements of expansion, which
connect with events in other areas of Hellenistic medicine none the less.
3 Medicine and Divinity
Temples, altars, sanctuaries, priestly personnel, festivals and other rituals associated
with Asklepios (and, increasingly, his whole family) spread and accumulated across the
Greek world in the Hellenistic period. In the wake of the foundation of the newpolis
of Kos in the mid four th centur y B C , for example, architectural developments began
at a nearby cult site which was to become home of one of the most notable Asklepieia
of antiquity. Major building work commenced around 300 B C , and the first temple
complex was completed by 242 B C , with a new and larger temple, together with
various other structures, being added in the second centur y. At Lebena in Crete too it
is the early third centur y B C that sees the creation of the Asklepieon proper, and there
are similar developments in Pergamon, also made grander and more monumental
in the following centur y, under Attalid patronage. The god is represented on
Medicine and Health 461



Pergamene coinage in the reign of Eumenes II, as he is on the obverse of Koan coins
from the mid second centur y B C , fur ther attesting to the of ficial commitment to, and
identification with, the cult. Older sanctuaries, like those at Athens and, most
famously, Epidauros, also experienced expansion at around the same time. The
former gained a new temple around 300 B C , and the latter, having benefited from a
lavish building programme in the early four th centur y, went on to acquire more
structures, such as a hostel, baths and stoa in the third. Many other examples of such
growth and investment could be of fered, and there is additional evidence for the
greater use and popularity of these sites in the Hellenistic era that seems to have gone
hand in hand with their aggrandizement. The number of anatomical votives, gener
ally thought to be of fered either in connection with a request, or in thanks, for cure of
the par ticular par t of the anatomy in question, found in sanctuaries of Asklepios
increases ver y substantially, `from the four th centur y onwards' (van Straten 1981:
149).
These more numerous votives are, moreover, not the exclusive proper ty of Askle
pios. In Hellenistic Athens, for example, anatomical ex votos were deposited in the
sanctuaries of Amynos and the Hero Doctor, as well as in that of Asklepios himself.
Both heroes were traditionally associated with healing, but votives to the more
recently arrived Ptolemaic deities, Isis and Sarapis, have also been found in the
Asklepieon on the Acropolis. Sarapis' healing powers were cer tainly acquired early
on in his divine career. Demetrios of Phaleron, the Peripatetic philosopher and
statesman, not only wrote hymns in honour of Sarapis after being miraculously
cured of blindness by him in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (D.L. 5.76),
but also focused on cures carried out by him in his sanctuaries in his five books On
Dreams (Artem. 2.44). Isis too acquires medical associations, though perhaps some
what later in her development. Diodoros, writing his histories in the first centur yB C ,
even gives her a foundational role for medicine in Egypt ± as the discoverer of drugs
and guardian of medical knowledge ± a role similar to that played by Asklepios
elsewhere (1.25.2).
This final point needs stressing, for Asklepios was the divine patron of, the divine
legitimation for, the medical ar t and its mor tal practitioners; not just an alternative
route to health. Physicians were, therefore, intimately connected with, not antagon
istic to, the cult of Asklepios, and did not draw sharp distinctions between seeking
medical help from amongst their own number and from their patron deity. In a world
in which the ability to make well was assumed to be among the powers of the gods,
was indeed an intrinsic element of their identity, turning to a deity when ill was an
obvious, and rational, response. Turning to Asklepios in par ticular only ser ved to
bring that response closer to going to a mor tal doctor. That Greeks and Macedonians
seem to have visited the sanctuaries of healing gods with greater frequency in the
Hellenistic age than before cannot, therefore, be taken as a rejection of other avenues
to cure, or as a manifestation of irrationalism. Nor can it be interpreted as an
indication of a widening social malaise, of greater anxiety and illness, since it could
just as easily be explained as resulting from increased wealth, mobility, expectations
and access, combined with the added allure of these now truly magnificent sites.
However, there are aspects of the cult of Asklepios and his healing colleagues which
do chime in with other aspects of the age and which might indicate some of the more
conceptual reasons why healing gods and their sites were both promoted and
462 Rebecca Flemming



aggrandized by kings and cities and increasingly frequented by their populations. For
divinity was, as ancient historian Simon Price has argued (1984: esp. 23±52), a key
resource for the negotiation of power in the ancient world, a resource that was more
explicitly drawn on by Macedonians and Greeks, as both r ulers and subjects, in the
Hellenistic period than before. Asklepios of fered a model of power that was par ticu
larly protective and curative, that engendered a more acceptable form of dependence,
and which, therefore, was peculiarly apt and productive for many of those involved in
the ongoing representations of, and responses to, Hellenistic patterns of power.
Thus we return to the imperialist dimension, to the imperialist theme of this paper,
adding another layer to its complexity, but also its suitability as an analytical tool for
understanding the range of medical developments in the Hellenistic world ± from
dissection to incubation. Not that this is the only useful approach to adopt towards
these phenomena, and each requires a much fuller examination than has been possible
here; but thinking about the intimate intrinsic connections between knowledge and
empires is cer tainly as beneficial in this context as it has been in many others.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
The Institutions of Hellenistic
Philosophy
Phillip Mitsis
1 Philosophical Institutions: Ancient and Modern
One feature of philosophy in the Hellenistic period often remarked upon is the way
that philosophical argument and study become increasingly the domain of trained
professionals. Whereas Sokrates, who ironically was to ser ve as the intellectual inspir
ation for so much of Hellenistic philosophy, approached his interlocutors with
philosophical arguments that were both immediate and non-technical, Hellenistic
philosophers often produced enormous amounts of specialized technical work clearly
accessible only to fellow professionals. However much they may claim to be interested
in alleviating the psychic distress of humanity at large, it is equally the case that they
often write to score points with fellow professionals against other professionals and
with a style and vocabular y that could only befuddle the uninitiated. The establish
ment and standardization of philosophical topics, the routine rehearsal of common
objections and responses, the intensity of focus on argumentative niceties, the cre
ation of a specialized vocabular y to be wielded and understood only by trained
technicians ± all indicate a discipline progressively leaving any amateur behind.
Of course, the notion of philosophers as professionals writing for other profession
als is something to which we have grown accustomed and a layperson picking up a
piece of professional philosophy today often might just as well be approaching an
advanced medical textbook or the latest issue of a physics journal. We may lament this
feature of contemporar y philosophical argument or we may think it just as essential to
developments in philosophy as special technical equipment is to the progress of other
specialized disciplines. Regardless of our views here, however, one thing seems
undeniable. What under writes the contemporar y practice of professional philosophy
is an extended system of institutional suppor t and reward. Without stable university
positions, salaries, fellowships, professional journals and presses, endowments and all
the other kinds of familiar institutional suppor t that under write the practice of
contemporar y philosophy, professional philosophy, as we know it, would cease to
exist.



It is tempting to assume initially, perhaps, that as it took on an increasing professional
aspect, philosophy in the Hellenistic period similarly was suppor ted by institutions of
increasing complexity, scope and power. How else to account for the unparalleled
persistence of the four storied schools of Hellenistic philosophy ± the Epicurean, Stoic,
Academic and Peripatetic ± and the enduring intellectual influence of their great
centres in Athens ± the Garden, Stoa, Academy and L yceum respectively? Such an
assumption becomes even more tempting, no doubt, when we dip into standard
accounts of Hellenistic philosophy. Although few now would subscribe to the easy
analogies drawn by nineteenth centur y European philologists between the ancient
philosophical schools and modern universities, it is not uncommon to find contem
porar y scholars making use of language and metaphors that suggest fairly straightfor
ward correspondences between ancient and modern institutions of philosophy.
A moment's reflection ser ves to make clear some fundamental differences, how
ever. First, and most obvious, perhaps, is the fact that philosophical schools do not
exist today as independent, freestanding institutions dedicated to the study and
teaching of philosophy. The contemporar y study of philosophy is suppor ted within
a larger institutional framework provided by colleges and universities and is thus
subject to a wide variety of constraints from without, as are its teachers and students.
Although scholars have sometimes described the ancient philosophical schools as `the
universities of antiquity' or have tried to trace the origins of the idea of the university
to practices in the ancient philosophical schools, nothing could be more misleading at
the level of institutional description. Whatever continuities or parallels might exist
between the methods and aims of teaching in these respective ancient and modern
pedagogical contexts, any attempt to draw parallels between actual ancient and
modern institutions quickly runs into a series of obstacles. This is because no ancient
philosophical school had anything remotely resembling philosophy's place or suppor t
in the wider institutional structures of the modern (or even medieval) university.
Indeed, in many ways the flourishing of philosophy in the Hellenistic period presents
a rather stark challenge to the notion that there is any strict correlation between the
power and resources of established institutions and the complexity, influence and
professional quality of the philosophical thinking and writing that they under write.
The Stoics, for instance, adherents of arguably both the most technically dextrous and
most enduringly influential of the Hellenistic schools, probably never managed to
acquire a single piece of property or the slightest bit of any other form of common
endowment. So too, although one sometimes hears talk of a long, uninterrupted line
of Stoic scholarchs throughout the Hellenistic period holding for th to generations of
students in the Stoa, we have good evidence that Chr ysippos, surely one of the most
accomplished and professionally visible of Stoic scholarchs, gave up teaching in the
Stoa to teach in the L yceum, Academy and the entrance of the Odeon ± the ver y
haunts of those old adversaries of Sokrates, the sophists. And he may have done so
quite consciously, since he claimed that the philosopher should make money by
charging for his teaching and `being a sophist' (Plut. Mor. [Stoic Contradictions]
1034b). Any talk of a Stoic `school', therefore, is likely to be misleading if it implies a
particular ongoing institution with a recognizable identity, structure, or even location
over and above the individuals or groups who happened to gather together and
identify themselves as Stoics at particular times and places.
The Institutions of Hellenistic Philosophy 465



By way of contrast, modern institutions of higher learning suppor t and lend
continuity to the study and teaching of philosophy independently, in a real sense, of
any par ticular individuals. In the Hellenistic period, only the Garden of the Epicur
eans provided anything remotely like this kind of institutional continuity. But it was a
striking exception. The for tunes of the other schools often ver y much depended on
the abilities, intellectual influence, and in some cases, the means of par ticular individ
uals. Nor should we forget that, for the most par t, what we actually have any real
evidence for are ver y short flurries of creative philosophical activity followed by
periods of silence that periodically are interrupted by what might best be described
as attempts to reformulate doctrines either in the face of new scientific developments
or of new philosophical challenges. It might be the case, as many have assumed, that
this evidence can best be accounted for by postulating coherent underlying insti
tutions that provided for the continuity, sur vival and development of the chief
philosophies of the Hellenistic period. But institutional continuity is cer tainly not
the only possible explanation, especially since any hard evidence, even for briefly
sur viving institutions, is remarkably scarce. Moreover, in several impor tant cases we
have much better reasons for concluding that, to the contrar y, philosophical activity
was occurring either without any institutional suppor t or under the banner of an
institution that in reality was long since defunct.
2 Institutions: Doctrines and Practice
In turning to the evidence, we face several methodological questions. Chief among
them initially, perhaps, is how to understand the relations between the stated doc
trines of a school and its institutional practices. Given the extreme paucity of evidence
for institutions of any kind or for any of the practices carried on within them, it has
often been tempting to tr y to reconstruct features of the schools from the varieties of
evidence that we do have ± philosophical doctrines in the main, sometimes aug
mented by anecdotal evidence about philosophers' personalities or about incidents
occurring at lectures, reactions to their teaching, etc. After all, one might suppose, it
hardly seems implausible to assume a cer tain continuity between a school's overt
doctrines and its educational practices and one cer tainly might expect a school's
arrangements to reflect or at least attempt to reflect in some measure the ver y
doctrines that gave rise to it in the first place. On closer inspection, however, one
soon discovers how dif ficult it is to make even the most simple inferences of this kind
and how spectacularly such inferences can go awr y.
We might find gaps between doctrines and actual school practices less surprising,
perhaps, if we pause to reflect for a moment on institutions for which we are much
better informed. Armed only with the New Testament, for instance, one might go on
to make some badly mistaken inferences about the likely forms of association that
have occurred among various groups of Christians in par ticular historical periods.
This is not only because the Gospels are open to a bewildering range of interpret
ations, but also because a host of other considerations can condition the dynamics
within groups. Conversely, if one were in possession of evidence only for the behav
iour and institutional practices of cer tain groups of avowed Christians, one might be
extremely hard pressed to recover the revealed doctrines they are meant to reflect.
Moreover, even in those cases where we both are well informed about the practices of
466 Phillip Mitsis



a par ticular group and have direct access to its guiding texts, we still may be at a loss
to understand the exact nature of the connections its members saw between their
doctrines and their institutions. How much more precarious, then, to make infer
ences from doctrines to institutional practices in the case of the philosophical schools.
Typically we have next to nothing in the way of evidence for internal practices, and
often, to complicate matters fur ther, fairly strong evidence of doctrinal disagree
ments.
Although few scholars today would move with any confidence between, say, the
educational ideals expressed in Plato's Republic and the little we know about what
may have gone on in the Academy, it is not uncommon for scholars to claim, based on
perceived contrasts in philosophical doctrines, that, at the ver y least, a dif ferent ethos
per vaded and gave shape to the respective institutional arrangements of the various
schools. Mar tha Nussbaum (1994), for instance, who argues that sharply contrasting
forms of association, pedagogical methods and intellectual goals were to be found in
the Peripatos and the Garden of Epicurus, has of fered a par ticularly strong statement
of this kind of view and one that well illustrates our methodological problem. The
Garden of the Epicureans, she claims, was a place where members were proselytized
by a series of careful techniques that speak to our deepest psychological anxieties.
Once these anxieties were laid bare, would-be Epicureans were subjected to a whole
batter y of coercive techniques whose object was inculcating Epicurean doctrine and
integrating individuals into a homogeneous community of true believers. Among
other things, new members would under take to memorize authoritative doctrines
and to put themselves under the spiritual control of superiors who had mastered
Epicurean techniques and who would keep them on the right path by administering
strong verbal admonitions. Community life in the Epicurean school was structured by
a shared concern for constant vigilance and strict adherence to Epicurean doctrines.
Thus members were urged to repor t the backsliding of others and to confess their
own lapses in belief or in behaviour.
The key contrast with the Peripatos and its centre, the L yceum, revolves around
questions of rationality and respect for individual autonomy. For Nussbaum, the
Garden was a place where the practical goals of therapy were placed above concerns
for the autonomy of individuals and for their rational understanding of the doctrines
they were absorbing. The Peripatos, on the other hand, embodied in a cer tain sense the
liberal ideals of the modern research university. It fostered free and unencumbered
inquir y with no constraints other than making one's views or results stand up to the
rigorous rational scrutiny of one's fellows. Students came to the L yceum in search of
knowledge and to engage in dialectical examination with fellow researchers; they did
not come because they were driven to address some deep inner psychological turmoil
or because they were seeking personal salvation. Presumably, in keeping with Aristo
tle's own views about the impor tance of early habituation for future moral and
intellectual inquir y, the L yceum attracted students with ver y dif ferent backgrounds
from those of the Garden and with dif ferent psychological experiences, intellectual
attainments, and an upbringing more conducive to free dialectical inquir y. As for the
nature of communal interaction in the Peripatos, one should imagine (an idealized)
Har vard or Oxford versus the alternative Moonie communities run by the Epicureans.
Although many might disagree either with details of Nussbaum's characterization
or with the sharpness of her contrast, it is safe to say that her views capture a general
The Institutions of Hellenistic Philosophy 467



consensus that something ver y dif ferent was going on in the Garden and in the
Peripatos with respect to teaching, research goals and methods, social interactions
and experiences, etc. And cer tainly at a general level it would be hard to deny that
this may ver y well have been the case. But the question we face is whether we are in
any position to recover actual dif ferences in school practice and whether we are
warranted in making inferences from the doctrines we find in philosophical texts
toward this end.
Did, as Nussbaum's account suggests, generations of peripatetic teachers engage in
the dialectical examination of philosophical topics with their students, show concern
to foster their independent research skills, display a healthy respect for their intellec
tual autonomy and avoid unappealing displays of paternalism when disagreeing with
them? And were they encouraged to do this on the basis of abiding institutional
structures that reflected Aristotelian commitments to such pedagogical methods and
goals? From the perspective of what we actually know about pedagogical practices in
the L yceum, such questions, frankly, are likely to look a little absurd. We are only ver y
rudimentarily informed about the for tunes of the Peripatos, and then not even for its
first hundred years. At that point the Peripatos itself, perhaps, but cer tainly any
sur viving evidence of its activities as an institution, disappears precipitously. What
remains, in addition to Aristotle's own works, is a substantial body of work by his
immediate successor as head of the school, Theophrastos, but thereafter only some
fragments and repor ts for Straton and L ykon, the next two heads of the school. What
are we in a position to conclude, therefore, about the ongoing pedagogical practices
in the Peripatos? Were Straton's lectures on microvoids and his classroom manner less
authoritarian and more openly dialectical, say, than the mathematical lectures of the
Epicurean Philonides? Straton apparently defended a unitar y view of the soul. Should
we conclude that he af firmed or denied Aristotle's views of habituation, with their
corresponding implications for student admission? Was Straton's repor ted talent for
refutation aimed at students in ways that fostered or hindered the development of
their rational autonomy? When we turn from Straton to his successor, is there any way
of deciding whether the apparently well-dressed and af fable L ykon dealt with stu
dents in a more or less authoritarian manner than his highly-strung and anorexic
predecessor? L ykon was said to be a vastly popular lecturer. But given his repor ted
predilections for pleasures and erotic pursuits, can we be sure that he avoided
demeaning entanglements with his students based, not on respect for their autonomy
and a concern for their intellectual growth, but purely as an expression of his own
desire and superior power?
We obviously are in no position to form judgements about any of these matters
responsibly, and indeed the only glimmers of evidence we have about actual peda
gogical practice suggest that as time went on the L yceum engaged more in instruc
tion than in discussion and dialectic (L ynch 1972: 84f f.). Whether this was a decision
made at a broader institutional level or whether some prominent individuals preferred
to teach this way in the face of earlier practices is anybody's guess. If we remember as
well Wilamowitz's complaint that Aristotle's choice of Theophrastos as the next head
of the Peripatos over Eudemos (Aulus Gellius 13.5) was autocratic and smacked of
paternalism (when compared to the elections of scholarchs in the Academy), conclu
sions about a general liberal ethos per vading the actual institutional arrangements of
the Peripatos seem, at best, merely fanciful. We therefore should be strongly suspi
468 Phillip Mitsis



cious, I think, about any attributions of a par ticular ethos to the L yceum as an
institution generally. It may be that the dialectical nature of the works that sur vive
under Aristotle's name gives theoretical witness to a respect for individual autonomy
and reflects Aristotelian views of the impor tance of our own rationality in assessing
and understanding beliefs about ourselves and the world. But such textual features,
on their own, provide an insufficient warrant for inferring that the ongoing peda
gogical methods of peripatetics displayed any special concern for autonomy or
rationality, especially given that the few bits of evidence that we do have about
institutional life in the Peripatos actually tend to tell against such a view.
Nussbaum's reconstruction of institutional life in the Garden raises a connected
methodological worr y, that of the relation between doctrines and par ticular practices
in those few cases where we actually have some evidence for the latter. In making her
argument that life in the Garden was rigidly hierarchical, coercive and ever vigilant
against heterodoxy, she relies heavily on Philodemos' On Frankness along with texts
of Epicurus that treat philosophy as analogous to therapy. Philodemos offers our
most complex and richly detailed discussion of pedagogical and social practices
associated with any ancient school. At the same time, however, On Frankness is a
text two hundred years removed from the days of Epicurus and one whose discussion
clearly may be influenced by later developments in groups far removed from the
original Garden in time, place, cultural and political milieu, etc. Thus, although
Philodemos alludes, for instance, to what looks like a developed hierarchical system
of Epicurean trainers and trainees, we have no independent evidence for such a
hierarchy within the institutions of early Epicureanism. Nor, indeed, do we have
any evidence for the type of close-knit community seemingly envisaged by Philode
mos' text. Indeed, one persistent misconception about the Garden is that a kind of
alternative community lived within its grounds committed to Epicurus' injunction to
`Live hidden'. Epicurus' will leaves to his followers a garden and a small house
separate from it, the latter for the use of his innermost circle and their children
(D.L. 10.19). But there is no serious evidence to suggest that Epicurus himself ever
envisaged groups coming together to live in the Garden in obedience to his prin
ciples; nor do we have any evidence of any permanent residences in the Garden at any
period. At one time, it was fashionable to postulate camps of humble little huts,a Á la
Lucretius book 5 no doubt, thronging the Garden. But in retrospect, this vision of a
kind of perpetual tent city in Athens abutting the walls of the Academy hardly can fail
to strain our credulity. It is much more likely that Epicureans went back and for th
from their residences to the Garden just as members of other schools went from their
homes to their meeting places. How they got there, of course, is a dif ferent
matter. Our most influential recent collection of Hellenistic philosophical texts, by
A. A. Long and David Sedley, includes an illustration of the ancient philosophical
schools in which the Academy is chock-a-block with serious-looking men and youths
reading and striking thoughtful poses. Next door, at the Epicurean Garden are two
huts, what appears to be a series of vegetable plots, and one solitar y fellow walking away
from what is either a ver y long-eared horse or a donkey. Old stereotypes die hard, it
seems. It is dif ficult to know what to say about the vegetable plots, except that they
seem more English than Greek. The donkey, as the saying goes, is hard to dispute with,
especially if we are meant to view him, not as the companion of a permanent resident,
but as having just dropped of f a visitor (Long and Sedley 1987: 4 for illustration).

Epicurean s cor resp onds, the refore, to any histo rically-o ccur ring group asso ciated
with the original Garden in Athe ns. Other Epicur ean groups in such places as Rhode s
or Kos may have pract ised dif ferently , but that rem ains a matt er of speculat ion. On
the other hand , we do have good evidenc e that memo rizing auth orita tive doct rines of
the mast er was a practice encou raged from the ver y beginni ngs of the school. Does
this count as evidenc e that pre vailing in the Garden was a ge neral ethos of disr egard
for rationa lity and indiv idual auto nom y? C er tainly not on its o wn, I think, since this
practice can be open to a varie ty of inte rpretations. When taken out of Nussbaum 's
more claust rophobic account of Epicure an grou p dynamics, me morizing doctrine
begins to look far less sinist er and thre atening to indiv idual autonom y . Nussbaum
aligns memo riza tion with Epicure an sayings that stress the therapeut ic aspect of
philosoph y , e.g. `Empty are the words of that phi losopher who of fers the rapy for
no hum an suf fer ing . . . there is no use in phi losophy if it does not ex pel the suf fering
of the soul' (Long and Sedley 1987: no. 25C Porphyr y , To Marcella 31). But we
also have Epicure an statemen ts (an d ones more likely to have bee n me morized by
adherent s) that suggest a strong commitm ent to tr uth and indiv idual und erstanding :
`One should not pretend to philosop hise, but actua lly philosophise . For what we
need is not the sem blance o f health, but real health' (Long and Sed ley 1987: no. 25D
Vatican Sayings 54). In this dif ferent light, it is possible to see how memorizing
might fu nction as an initial aid to o ne's fur ther ra tional underst anding of doct rine,
not merely as a replace ment fo r it. Thus , Eliza beth Asmis (2001), for exampl e, takes
the Epicure an practice of memo rizing auth orita tive sa yings as par t of the initial stages
of Epicure an educat ion, a basic first step by which one comes to eve ntually un der
stand the thou ght of the Master ra tionally . She also finds noth ing objec tionably
coerci ve in the sor t of h ierarchies describe d by Philode mos, but ra ther views them
as an insti tution grou nded in friendl y guidance ± gui dance of the sor t that is resp ect
ful of student s' auto nom y and slow ly leads them to rationally underst and the tr uths
of Epicureanis m for the mselves .
How then are we to choose bet ween the se two diamet rically opposed visio ns of life
in the Garde n? Both tr y to link the Epicurean practice of me morizi ng auth oritative
sayings to te xtual doc trines. Ho wever, texts c an b e found that put this behaviour in a
dif ferent light. Moreove r, it is clear that dif fer ent groups can engage in the sa me
practice for dif ferent purpos es, reg ardless of any te xtual war rant. Our problem is that
we have insuf ficient histo rical evidenc e to decide how the practice of memo riza tion
was actua lly car ried on within the Garde n and what inter nal insti tutional functi ons it
was me ant to ser ve. We do not know , that is, the kinds of conne ctions groups of
Epicurean s themselv es might have seen between their auth oritativ e texts and this
practice, or betwe en their doct rines and their insti tutions more general ly . Pre sumably
some of the ir memb ers nev er achie ved the requisi te ratio nal underst anding of
Epicur us ' though t, regardle ss of the time they spent in me morizi ng, whi le othe rs
perhaps did. But our evidenc e does not allow us to d iscriminat e fi nely enough to
deter mine the ex act natu re of this practice and its functi on in the Garde n. Any conclu
sions about a general ethos in the Garden seem, ther efore, to be on much the same
footing as those made about the Perip atos, even thou gh we initiall y may seem bet ter
infor med about some feat ures o f the Epicure ans' insti tutional life. This is b ecause, gi ven
the limit ations of our evi dence, we are not in a posi tion to decid e how par ticu lar practice s
470 Phillip Mitsis



were actually car ried o n nor can we be su re of their point. Maki ng this claim, I hope,
is not to give in to so me lam entable fo r m of his torical scepticism ; rather, it is meant as
a gent le reminde r of the kinds of evi dence we would need to defen d claim s about the
general et hos of institut ions. The Epicure ans were doct rinally philosop hical dogma
tists in the way that memb ers of the Per ipatos pre sumab ly were not. But how this
dif ference in philoso phical attit ude transla ted into the institution s and actual peda
gogi cal practice s of the ir two res pective schools is not someth ing that we can hope to
recov er on the basis of inferences from pe rceived contra sts in philosophica l doct rine,
even at a general lev el.
3 Institutions and Their Scope
It is unf or tuna te that although we have so me intri guing and suggestive title s in
booklists (e.g. Peri Askeseos, Peri Agoges, Didaskalos, etc.), there are no sur viving
treatise s from any of the fo unders of the fo ur schools that take up in a the oretical way
such qu estions as a philosop hical school's proper ar rangem ents, its institution s, the
best and most producti ve fo r ms of insti tutional life, et c. More over, althou gh it seems
plausible to assume that the founders the mselves took at least some pains over the
ongoing inter nal ar rang ements of their schools, our evi dence is larg ely silen t on this
point. Indeed, it is surprisi ng how lit tle provision they seem to have made for the
sur vival of their schools at all, if they had an y hopes that it woul d be through such
institution s that their though t woul d endure and continue to be propag ated. Pl ato
taught both at the Academy and later in an adjoining gard en a t Kolon os whe n h e
retur ned from Sici ly for the first time (D. L. 3.5, 3.20 ). His will, however, makes no
menti on of the gard en and makes no provision fo r the continuat ion o f his school
(D.L. 3 .41±3). W e therefore have no evidenc e to suggest that Pl ato believe d that his
school would cont inue its acti vities af ter his death, nor do we know if he cared. W e do
know , howeve r, that he took no special steps to ensure its future insti tutional life,
even by maki ng the minim al gesture of namin g a su ccessor . A ristotle , too, made no
provision s fo r any par ticular insti tution to su r vive him, thou gh he seems to have
picked a successor . Being a resident foreigne r, he could not legally own proper ty in
Athens . More over, given h is flig ht from Athens for pol itical reasons, it is unlike ly that
he could have ever ima gined such an institution comi ng into being in a city that had
become so hostile. The Stoic Zeno, like wise, was a res ident fo reigner at Athens, as was
his success or Kleanth es. Althoug h feted by the A thenians for his ser vice s to vir tue
with a gold crown and a tomb upo n his death (D.L. 7.10 ±12), in his lifetime Zeno
could have ha rboured no hopes for the kind of private grou nds and facilitie s enjoyed
by the Epicure ans. Amon g the four so-calle d founders , the n, it is really only Epicur u s,
who made any materi al provision s for an institution to outlas t him . Wheth er o r not
we accept Diskin Clay's thesis that Epicur us fur ther trie d to ensure the su r viv al of his
thou ght by depositing cent ral works in the archives of Athens (Clay 1998: 40±54), he
is the only on e of the fou r who cons ciously prov ided physical resource s for the
sur vival of his school. In this he was pre ceded by A ristotle' s successor, Theoph rastos,
who acquire d and bequeat hed a gard en for the Per ipatos that prov ided a privat e space
for the next few generat ions of that school. W e know that Pl ato's gard en as well,
presum ably inheri ted b y his nephe w Speusi ppos, came to ser ve as a meet ing pl ace for
his imme diate su ccessors, though afte r the death o f its third head, Polem on, n o more
The Institutions of Hellenistic Philosophy 471



mention of it is made in our sources. It is wor th noting these simple points, perhaps,
since when we speak of the Academy, L yceum, Garden and Stoa it is often easy to
think of something much more grand and to forget on just how fragile a foundation,
in the sense of private material suppor t, the ancient schools sur vived. Of course, some
prominent members of schools, such as Theophrastos, were exceedingly well of f. But
ongoing resources for the suppor t of philosophy at any kind of institutional level were
decidedly minimalist. Apar t from some small bits of proper ty which usually were
alienated among philosophically interested family members for their own use, but
then often lost for the future use of the school, some pieces of furniture, and small
collections of books, which also tended quickly to go out of groups' possession, the
material resources available for most practising philosophers as members of schools
were practically nil. Schools in the material sense typically consisted of little more than
a private place where members could meet and make use of the librar y belonging to
the school's head. Moreover, except for the Epicureans, it is not clear that any of the
schools enjoyed even such modest amenities for more than their first few generations.
The Stoics managed on less. Illustrative of their institutional resources is the stor y
that Kleanthes, after becoming the second head of the Stoa, augmented the money
gained from his teaching by engaging in the lowly profession of water-carrier (D.L.
5.168).
When we speak of the ancient schools, then, we are speaking of institutions that
primarily relied on traditions of teaching and on the ongoing relations of individuals
for their continuity and sur vival. This is one reason why analogies to our contempor
ar y institutions can be so misleading. In fact, one of the greatest impediments to our
understanding of the ancient schools as institutions is perhaps simply our habit of
calling them `schools', since so many of the associations that this word holds for us do
not apply in the ancient context. Take, for instance, a representative claim by the great
French historian of education, Henri-Irenee Marrou. In the course of what is often
taken to be the standard account of education in the philosophical schools, he claims
that a small number of elite students went on to study philosophy after completing
the regular Hellenistic enkyklios paideia (roughly `general education') and that they
would begin their studies with lectures in the histor y of philosophy (Marrou 1956:
309). This should all sound rather familiar, since it corresponds to our own experi
ence of a few elite students going directly on to study philosophy in schools after
finishing their preliminar y studies. Nor is this familiarity unplanned. This is because,
for Marrou, the Hellenistic schools are in many ways not only paradigmatic of Greek
educational principles generally, but also the source for our own educational insti
tutions. Moreover, he subscribes to a longue dure Â e conception of institutions (cf. Too
2001: 2±10) in which one explains historical phenomena by means of resemblance,
analogies and parallels to subsequent contexts. There is an obvious danger of an
achronism in such a procedure, one might think, but the claim is that this vision of
the historical connections among institutions holds out the promise of discovering
deep underlying correspondences between practices that we might other wise miss.
Such an account, however, whatever its use in helping to isolate paradigmatic and
static trans-historical structures ± and ones that ser ve as models for later historical
periods ± blurs what, if anything, is to my mind most characteristic of the teaching of
philosophy in the Hellenistic period. And that is the ever-shifting plurality of forms of
association, many of them evanescent, which arose among par ticular philosophical
472 Phillip Mitsis



groups, groups whose composition and intellectual focus rarely remained stable. Did
some elite students go on to study philosophy after finishing their preliminar y
studies? There can be little doubt. But it is hard to believe that the Epicureans and
Stoics, regardless of their increasing concern with philosophical polemics, star ted
their students of f with lectures in the histor y of philosophy. Indeed, we have evidence
that they did not, since in their view there would be little value in getting things out
of focus immediately by exposing students to a regrettable histor y of philosophical
error. More impor tant, however, Marrou's account treats philosophical education as
being the next potential step in a larger, more systematic process of Greekpaideia and
one that depends on one's prior education. But this claim, apar t from admitting of
many exceptions, more worr yingly assimilates philosophical study into a wider insti
tutional str ucture that it never enjoyed. Philosophical education was typically viewed
as something separate and unconnected, and cer tainly never a par t of enkyklios
paideia. The stor y of Epicur us turning to philosophy because his schoolmaster
could not explain to him the meaning of `chaos' in Hesiod (D.L. 10.2) is just one
of many illustrations of the fact that philosophical questions were viewed as some
thing apar t from standard education. Indeed, Epicur us exhor ted those interested in
philosophical questions and the good life to shun the standard education entirely:
`Hoist all sail, my dear boy, and steer clear of all education' he urges his follower
Pythokles (D.L. 10.6). Philosophical study was viewed by the Epicureans as a
replacement for standard education, not as a next step following upon it. Similarly
for Stoicism, it is hardly likely that a student like Kleanthes, for instance, had much
prior education, since he was a boxer from an impoverished background. The jibes of
his fellow students, moreover, by no means suggest that he could be characterized as
the elite product of a system of general education. But my point is not to line up
exceptions to Marrou's claim, since there are many. It is to dispute his general picture
of philosophical study as duly taking up its assigned place, much as in our own day, in
the wider institutional str uctures of cultural and political life. Such an account implies
the kind of stable ongoing system of institutional suppor t that the study of philoso
phy in the `schools' of the Hellenistic period just did not have.
4 Schools and Their Adherents
In antiquity, a variety of terms were used to refer to the activities of philosophers (see
Glucker 1978: 159ff.). Some, such as exedra (a form of hall), peripatos (a walkway)
and kepos (garden), referred to the places where they met and strolled. Schole and
diatribe came to be used to describe courses of study and lectures.Hairesis and agoge,
in the sense of choices of a par ticular type of philosophical life and view of one'stelos
(end or philosophical goal), become more prominent later in the period. Indeed, it
became a matter of controversy whether some philosophers, e.g. cynics, could be said
to belong to a hairesis. Hippobotos, in his On the Sects, denied a place to cynics
among the `schools' precisely because they produced no body of coherent doctrine
and they seemed to be unable to specify a telos for their style of life (Bracht Branham
and Goulet-CazÂ e 1996: 21±3). Whether we agree with Hippobotos' definitional
strictures here, it is perhaps salutar y to reflect on the way he formulates the problem.
He believes that a philosophical school is primarily a group of adherents who share
the same view of the telos. Obviously, such a criterion raises problems of its own. It is
The Institutions of Hellenistic Philosophy 473



too general to capture readily such phenomena as the strong shifts in doctrines that
occurred among Academics; nor can it pretend to account suf ficiently for any of the
fine-grained relationships that doubtlessly structured membership in the schools.
Clearly, life in philosophical groups was shaped by a myriad of personal relationships,
rivalries and personal research agendas, for which we have only the most inadequate,
scattershot testimony. But it is perhaps wor th following out some of the implications
of this claim, however general, if only as a corrective to the kinds of misconceptions
we are likely to fall prey to if we follow Marrou's lead in thinking of philosophical
activity as taking place in schools in the familiar sense.
Obviously such generalizations can be crude, but in looking at the overall histor y of
philosophy in the period, we can see in each hairesis, as it were, some roughly similar
patterns consisting of brief flurries of philosophical activity followed by inter vals of
silence and, in some cases, shor t-lived revivals. Obviously, we need to be on our guard
not to substitute one form of anachronism for another, but in some ways it may be
helpful to think of ancient philosophical `schools', in the first instance, as emerging
and initially functioning in a way that corresponds to how we might today view the
`school' of Wittgenstein and his followers, or the `schools' of Leo Strauss or Ayn
Rand. The analogy is by no means per fect, of course, since followers of these modern
scholarchs typically are suppor ted individually within universities and thus lead intel
lectual lives that, while more secure, are both more dispersed and isolated than their
ancient counterparts. But the point of the analogy is to tr y to pick out some common
features shared by groups of adherents to schools of thought ± schools of thought
that wax and wane in popularity and prestige, perhaps, but that manage to continue
attracting individuals who subscribe to their par ticular doctrines. To be sure, one
could not describe these contemporar y groups as comprising schools in the familiar
sense of a group of individuals gathered together under the aegis of a common, stable
institution with fixed curricula, degrees, legal status, formal admission requirements,
dedicated positions, etc. But we can recognize them as adherents to par ticular schools
of thought, nonetheless, by the rough, if changing, similarity of their views and their
shared intellectual commitments.
Although there are several significant dif ferences that must be taken into account,
it may be wor th pursuing this analogy fur ther since it captures some additional
features of schools of thought and the behaviour of their adherents that may be
relevant to our discussion. Like the followers of Wittgenstein, Strauss or Rand, the
first followers of Plato, Aristotle, Zeno and Epicurus were attracted by their masters'
compelling combination of philosophical talent and personal charisma. There is no
need to retail the ancient lore in suppor t of this point, especially since too much
ancient evidence for modern tastes typically is directed precisely at demonstrating this
often problematic feature of the psychology of philosophical groups. No doubt
connected to this characteristic of philosophical groups is the way that, at least
among the generation of students who have had direct contact with the master,
there arises a deep concern to understand and propagate the master's thought. At
the same time, although personal study and conversation with the great master can
ser ve as a special mark of distinction, it is also something that can colour doctrinal
disputes with charges of loyalty and betrayal and it cer tainly can foster personal
jockeying based on claims to the master's favour, etc. Not surprisingly, therefore,
internal disputes often arise among the first generation of adherents about the exact
474 Phillip Mitsis



impor t of par ticular doctrines or actions of the master, occasionally leading to bitter
disputes, charges of apostasy, excommunications, etc. One further impor tant consid
eration here is that within ancient philosophical groups, family relationships were
similarly involved and added their own special dynamic to the mix.
But a clear dif ference that one typically sees between this first generation of
students and those generations with no personal experience of the master is that
the personal force and character of such worries begins to wane in later generations.
In the same way, say, that Wittgenstein's immediate students took on some of his
personal mannerisms along with his doctrinal ones, so some of Plato's immediate
students began to mimic his stoop (Plut. Mor. 26b, 53c) as well as his manner of
argument. But the stooping Platonist and the impossibly arrogant, abrupt and laconic
Wittgensteinian rarely makes an appearance in the generation which has had no direct
personal experience of the master. Such af fectations are not likely to carr y weight with
members of these later generations, in any case. So too, among those adherents of
subsequent generations, it is harder to find those with the same kind of commitment
to the master's par ticular projects or to find those who wish to take on the mantle of
his thought with the same doctrinal reverence as those who experienced that thought
firsthand. To style oneself a Wittgensteinian today, for example, is a ver y dif ferent
proposition from what it meant, say, for ty years ago in the days of Norman Malcolm,
and it involves an altogether dif ferent level of commitment to a cult of personality.
Even the most cursor y look at the early histor y of Peripatetic, Academic, or Stoic
thought shows how quickly corresponding shifts of focus and doctrine appear with
each new generation. The histor y of Academic philosophy in the Hellenistic period,
for example, presents such profound shifts in doctrine that scholars are at a loss to find
even the thinnest of common threads uniting its first few generations. For the most
par t, its `institutional' histor y and continuity consists of little more than a list of
scholarchs. The early and short-lived Peripatos undergoes deep shifts in focus, if not
doctrine, and the later renewal of Aristotelianism under Kritolaos seems to be much
more an exploration of Aristotelian possibilities and positions in the face of new
philosophical challenges than attempts to examine and revive actual doctrines of the
master. Stoicism, too, along with some strong early doses of infighting, undergoes
measurable shifts in focus, although these shifts are typically presented as capturing
the true spirit of the founder's thought. But they are shifts, nonetheless, and again it
is only the Epicureans who maintain an easily recognizable doctrinal continuity along
with their institutional continuity and thus provide an exception to this pattern. But
even here the overall rigidity in Epicureanism can be overdone. Later Epicureans such
as Zeno of Sidon and Diogenes of Tarsos seemed per fectly willing to recast works of
the master in dif ferent forms. And although it has been claimed that Epicureans were
deeply concerned to establish canonical texts, we do not find among them, as we
might expect if this were the case, a parallel tradition of commenting on texts such as
we find in later Aristotelianism (Snyder 2000: 54).
One fur ther feature of philosophy in the Hellenistic period that bears on this
analogy is the manner in which talented philosophers took up the mantle of one of
the great masters' thought and attempted to breathe life into neglected doctrines e.g.
Kritolaos' `revival' of Peripatetic thought or Arkesilaos' reinvigoration of Academic
philosophy. Correspondingly, in a few generations, perhaps, some power ful thinker
might again take up the mantle of Wittgenstein and revive aspects of his thinking that
The Institutions of Hellenistic Philosophy 475



have fallen out of fa shion. When Krit olaos did this fo r Aristotel ianism , and identifie d
himself as a Perip atetic, the L yceum had bee n defunct as an institution for ove r one
hundred years. His adhere nce to the `Peripato s' was thus not a pl edge to any ong oing
institution , bu t to a school of though t.
Of course, it woul d be misleadi ng to su ppose that this notion of a scho ol of
though t can capture all the varie ties of philosophica l associat ion that occur red in
our per iod. But it can per haps help us to see someth ing whose impor tance fo r the
sur viv al and su ccess of Helleni stic philosophy cann ot be un derestimat ed, alth ough it
is sometime s overlooke d in accounts of insti tutions. C ontempo rar y adhere nts to
schools of thou ght are ty pically suppor ted by esta blishe d ins titutions, but nonethe less
the long-te r m powe r and influe nce of the ir philosophie s depen d less on institution al
mandate s, in many ways, than on their o wn talent and teaching. In this they provide a
clear and impor tant parallel to Hell enistic phi losophers. T his is because it is primar ily
to these more inti mate perso nal rhythm s of phi losophical life ± and not to any
institution al backing prov ided by someth ing called `the Stoa' or `the L yceum' ±
that we owe the sur vival, powe r and professional compl exit y of Helleni stic phi loso

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
Literature and its Contexts
Richard Hunter
1 Survival and Loss
Our view o f Helleni stic literat ure is fragm ented and sk ewed by the chance s of
sur vival. T he h igh poet r y of the third cent ur y , par ticularly that asso ciated with the
cour t of the Ptolemi es at Alexandri a, holds cent re-stage, but (for exam ple) Helleni stic
orator y and traged y are all but compl etely lost, and we must recons tr uct most of the
literar y sc holarship of the period from sc attered fragm ents and the scholia to the texts
of earlie r ages , whi ch wer e n ow prope rly `edited' for the fir st time. The natu ral
concen tration upon Alexandri a can obscure the flowering of a brilli ant Doric literar y
cultur e in the W est: Theocri tus allows us a glimpse of this, but o ne would give much
to have one of Rhinthon' s tragic paro dies from the same period and ar ea (cf . Taplin
1993: 48±52). The literat ure of the second and first centur ies has, in par ticular, fared
badly : epigram s (includ ing those of Meleage r of Gada ra, whose `Garla nd', an anthol
ogy of poem s by himself and othe rs, may still be glimpse d within the sur viv ing
Palatine Anthology), the Europa of Moschos, some bucolic poems which probably
sur vived because of their association with Theocritus, Bion's Epitaph for Adonis
(Reed 1997), and the anonymous Epitaph for Bion are practically all the poetr y
which sur viv es intact from this cr ucial transition al per iod. Nev er theless, it is also
impor tant to remem ber that a ver y impor tant par t o f `literar y exp erience' in this
period was constr uc ted through the great texts of the past, most notably per haps
Hom er and Euripi des, and it is through the cons tant re-int erpretati on and appropri
ation of the se te xts, an appropr iation that took place in thousa nds of element ar y
schoolroom s as well as in the atres and in the books of lear n ed men, that they may be
conside red as much `H ellenistic' as `arc haic' or `c lassical'. The Helleni stic age is
indeed one of the more remarkable and impor tant pe riods of Hom eric recept ion,
and in the world after Alexander, the alter Achilles himself, a world of power ful
`kings' (basileis) of many dif ferent shades of legitimacy , the Iliad became again a
strongly didactic text about ( inter alia) power and conflict, as the Odyssey became an
obvio us pre-echo of the apparentl y eve r-expa nding geog raphical horizo ns of Greek
cultur e.



If readings of Homer represent large-scale reactions to a shifting social geography,
the new possibilities of movement, dislocation and loss are perhaps reflected at a
micro-level in the hundreds of `literar y' funeral epigrams of the Hellenistic period.
The epigram of fers the ever-moving `passer-by' a brief moment of stillness, while the
deceased's often bitterly brief moment of kleos asserts the value of life in the face of the
hopelessness of human mor tality. Thus the following poem of Callimachus unites his
own community of Cyrene in grief,
At dawn we buried Melanippos, and while the sun
Was setting the maiden Basilo died
By her own hand, unable to live once she had placed
Her brother on the pyre. The house of their father
Aristippos looked upon evil doubled, and all Cyrene plunged
In grief, seeing that home of noble children orphaned.
(Epigram 20 Pf., trans. Nisetich)
whereas in another poem the separation and loss of death is cruelly actualized in
geographical distance:
If you come to Kyzikos, it's small trouble (ponos) to find Hippakos
and Didyme, for in no way obscure (aphanes) is the family.
And you must say to them a painful word (epos), but say it
All the same: I hold their son, Kritias, here.
(Epigram 12 Pf., trans. Nisetich)
The poem quite literally `fills out' the narrative of grief which lies behind the factual
details ± ` ``Who lies here?'' ``X from Y'' ' ± of the standard epitaphic epigram, which
here frame the poem (Kyzikos . . . Kritias). There is an obvious contrast, pointed by
the semantic range of ponos, `trouble, ef for t' as well as `grief ', between the `small
trouble' which the passer-by needs to endure to pass on the message, once he reaches
Kyzikos, and the grief which that message will cause (Walsh 1991). No one wishes to
be the bearer of bad tidings, and the epigram exploits the unease which the passer
by/reader will feel; there is no pressure, no `command' to tell the news to the parents,
but rather a conditional, `If you travel to Kyzikos . . . '. Only by adopting such a low
key can the grief be controlled. The ver y distance, however, between Kyzikos on the
Propontis and wherever the `epitaph' now stands (is it being read in Nor th Africa?)
both complicates the asser tion of `little trouble' and pathetically underscores the
irretrievable distance between Kritias and his parents; though his family may be `in
no way obscure' (aphanes), Kritias has disappeared (i.e. is aphanes) for ever, and the
confident asser tion of v.2 has more than a touch of desperate whistling in the dark.
If, however, these poems reflect some of the mobility of the Hellenistic world, we
never theless know far too little about Greek literature reflecting the cultural inter
change of the high Hellenistic period, though various texts, such as the `Letter of
Aristeas', which describes the translation of the Septuagint by Jewish sages at Alexandria,
and the Exagoge of Ezekiel, a tragic dramatization of the Septuagint stor y of the
flight of Moses and the Jews from Egypt, allow us a glimpse of Jewish culture in
second-centur y Alexandria. Papyri and inscriptions reveal that Greek literature was
read and per formed all over the world opened up by Alexander, but of the new
478 Richard Hunter



compositions which that new world brought forth, only traces remain. We know, for
example, almost nothing of the influential works of the Cynic Menippos of Gadara, in
whom Semitic and Arabic traditions of `prosimetrum' (i.e. compositions which use
both prose and verse) have reasonably been thought to have left their mark.
2 Display and Self-Representation
If `Greek' and `other' is one opposition which both structures and is constantly
interrogated in Hellenistic literature, another is that of `high/elite' vs. `low/popular'
culture. It is frequently argued that in the post-classical world the gulf between elite
and non-elite culture became a yawning chasm, one propped ever wider by the
circulation of written texts to be enjoyed by a relatively tiny, though socially power ful,
minority; on the other side of the gap, so the argument goes, will have been a
kaleidoscopic per formance culture, most of which has perished for ever, but for
occasional notices in compilers such as Athenaeus and a fitful epigraphic record
which preser ves the names of poets and per formers of all kinds and all levels of
formality. Like many sharply drawn distinctions, there is some truth in this. There
cer tainly are clear dif ferences in, par ticularly, metrical and verbal style between `high
literature' and what we can reconstruct of this almost wholly lost world of per form
ance and popular enter tainment (Hunter 1996a: 7±13). On the other hand, the
opposition itself is, in par t at least, the creation of the elite texts themselves: thus,
Theocritus' hexameter mimes and Herodas' Mimiamboi, in an old-fashioned metre
and a literar y reconstruction of an archaic dialect, call attention to (and hence
reify)`the mime' as a separate area of cultural experience, precisely by `translating' it
to a dif ferent mode. A famous epigram of Callimachus (cf. below) is precisely built
upon the fragility of such elite constructions, though the elite prose literature of
subsequent centuries, which never tires of unfavourable comparisons between the
`morally beneficial' reading and recitation practices of the educated classes and the
`vulgar' enter tainments of the common people, does not seem to have listened. Such
distinctions trace their intellectual heritage to Plato's remarks (Laws 3.700c±d) on the
increasing ef facement of distinctions between generic types, which results from a
pandering to vulgar taste, and Aristotle's discussion of the dif ferent modes of humour
practised by the educated and the vulgar (Eth. Nic. 4.1128a). Ultimately, of course,
this self-consciousness about language use goes back, as also does the intellectual
framework of many of the scholarly practices of the Alexandrian Museum, to the
central concerns of the sophistic era. The literature of `display', which has at its hear t
the asser tion or confirmation of group or individual identity, is always concerned to
mark dif ference between itself and `other'.
`Display', epideixis, is indeed a crucial element in some Hellenistic poetr y: L yko
phron's Alexandra, with its extraordinar y riddling catalogue of Greek myth, the dark
curses of Euphorion's Thrax and the didactic poems of Nikander on poisons and
snake-bites are among the prominent examples usually cited. Metrical experimen
tation now comes to the fore. Sotades of Maroneia transposed the Iliad into `sexy'
sotadeans (an ionic metre), and Philikos, a member of the group of writers of tragedy
known (at least later) as the `Pleiad' and an impor tant priest of Dionysos at Alexan
dria, composed a poem on the rape of Persephone and the grief of Demeter in
choriambic hexameters and offered this novelty as a gift to the grammatikoi (Supp.
Literature and its Contexts 479



Hell. 676±80). Scholarship and learning are indeed not spared from the per vasive
irony which colours the best poetr y of the period. Thus, for example, the poetr y of
Simichidas, the pompous young poet of Theocritus' Seventh Idyll, is characterized by
a `display' of his knowledge of obscure Arcadian cult, and the pedantic poetic voice of
Callimachus' Aitia (cf. below) is constantly the subject of gentle humour; at fr. 75.8
(`Acontius and Cydippe') the poet's `much knowledge' nearly lands him in a serious
blasphemy. One of Callimachus' most famous epigrams deals explicitly with the folly
of elitist self-delusion:
I hate recycled poetr y (poiema kuklikon), and get no pleasure
From a road crowded with travellers this way and that.
I can't stand a boy who sleeps around, don't drink
at public fountains, and loathe ever ything vulgar (demosion).
Now you, L ysanies, sure are handsome . . . But before I've repeated
`handsome', `and some . . . one else's' cuts me off.
(Epigram 28 Pf., trans. Nisetich)
The poet proclaims his disdain for all things common or banal which must be widely
shared: `cyclic' poetr y, the broad highway, a promiscuous lover, a fountain available to
all. The variety of the verbs in the first four verses marks the poet's fastidiousness and
care, whereas the ver y prosaic expression for the things which are rejected enacts at
the verbal level the banality which is being imputed to them. What is rejected also
involves or implies movement: the poem `which circles around', the path with its
bustling crowd, the boy who roams from one admirer to the next, the fountain to
which one must travel; against this chaos is set the stillness of the poet, fixed in his
opinions and the privacy of his superiority. The final couplet modifies this picture.
The play with echo suggests the emergence of a truth which previously was (con
sciously or unconsciously) suppressed (Walsh 1990: 11±12); the poet's brave words
turn out to be a protective barrier which conceal as much as they reveal, and only the
operation of echo, which is beyond human control, can unmask the truth. The
`vulgar', embodied in a popular, `non-elitist' pronunciation which makes the echo
possible, triumphs. The poem thus explores the fissure inherent in the whole business
of seeking to write `elitist' epigrams about eros, an emotion to which we are all
vulnerable (it is always demosion) and one which is no respecter of aesthetic principles;
it is not merely that the store of epigrammatic literar y topoi is finite, but so is that of
experience ± hierarchies of literature are, in the end, as vain as hierarchies of kinds of
lover.
If it is literar y taste to which Callimachus gives pride of place in his (as it will turn
out, crumbling) sense of himself, then this too is representative of an impor tant
feature of Hellenistic literar y culture. When scholars and poets dispute over the
quality of Antimachos' poetr y (Krevans 1993; Cameron 1995: 303±38) or over
the relative merits of Homer and Hesiod, it is of course the present which is as
much at issue as the past; in one sense this is merely an intensification of the attitudes
parodically described already in, for example, Aristophanes' Clouds: `modernity' (or,
as it now is and was already with the sophists of the late fifth centur y, dif ferent
manifestations of `modernity') is expressed through adhesion to par ticular intellectual
and poetic modes. This intensification, however, depends upon an equally intensified
480 Richard Hunter



sense of the monumentality of the past, a phenomenon most easily recognizable
perhaps in the rise of scholarship. Although the clear sense of a `break' in literar y
culture after Alexander is explicit only in the critics of the Augustan age, various
indications point in the same direction for the earlier period of the Hellenistic age:
Eratosthenes did not carr y his chronographical work on the Olympian victors beyond
the death of Alexander, and Aristarchos and Aristophanes of Byzantion did not
receive anyone `of their own time' into the lists of approved authors (Quintilian
Inst. Or. 10.1.54).
The past was quite literally monumentalized and made available in physical form in
the unparalleled collection of texts in the Librar y of Alexandria, which could, if need
be, themselves assume human form. Thus Callimachus (Iambus 1) brings the archaic
Ionian poet Hipponax, himself an object of serious scholarly endeavour, back from
the dead to introduce a `modern' version of Hipponactean poetr y and to contrast the
wisdom of the legendar y Seven Sages with the petty squabbles of their Alexandrian
descendants; the modernity matters, for in a matching poem (Iambus 13) Callima
chus also makes the point that mindless copying of archaic and classical poetic modes
is not what `poetr y' should be about. The past is something to be engaged with,
creatively exploited, sometimes indeed surpassed, not merely reproduced. The same
message is delivered by Apollo himself to Callimachus in perhaps the most famous
and influential passage of Hellenistic poetr y:
The ver y first time I sat down and put
A writing tablet on my lap, my own
L ykian Apollo said to me: `Make your sacrifice
as fat as you can, but keep
your Muse on slender rations. And see that you go
where no hackneys plod: avoid the ruts
car ved in the boulevard, even if it means
driving along a narrower path.
(Aitia fr.1.21±8, trans. Nisetich)
Avoiding the `broad highway' is a matter of using the past intelligently, not of a
fruitless search for `originality'. So it is that Hellenistic elite poetr y is intensely
inter textual in its constant allusive reference to archaic and classical texts, par ticularly
of course Homer. This is not a matter of setting puzzles for the reader, but of using
creatively the most impor tant shared aspect of experience between poet and reader,
namely the experience of previous literature. This past heritage can no more be
wished away than can the future; the young Cyclops of Theocritus' Eleventh Idyll,
trapped in a language and a future which Homer has created for him, offers a
par ticularly amusing vision of this paradoxical modernity.
3 Hellenistic Comedy
The most impor tant Hellenistic literar y form, in terms of the breadth and longevity of
its cultural impact, was New Comedy. We have enough Menander to feel reasonably
confident about the nature of this dramatic form, though his rivals and successors
sur vive only in fragments and through the Latin adaptations of Plautus and Terence.
Literature and its Contexts 481



New Comedy was performed all over the Greek world and its role, enacted both
through per formance in the theatre and through private reading and recitation, in
spreading a par ticular set of `civilizing' values and even indeed forms of social
behaviour, ought not to be underestimated. Set in a contemporar y world and
reflecting the concerns and assumptions of well-to-do oikoi, no texts offer as rich an
oppor tunity for the exploration of cer tain Hellenistic moral and social patterns. It has
often been thought that the repeated narrative motif of family separation and ultim
ate, wish-fulfilling recognition and reunion, together with the prominent role of
Tyche, `For tune', reflects the great upheavals and dislocations and the almost con
tinuous war fare of the age; what is clear, however, is that, although the political and
social life of Athens can be readily mapped as background into many of the plays, the
plots no longer depend upon a detailed knowledge of any one city and the focus is on
the lives of individuals and individual families, whose fate is not symbolic of the life of
the polis in the complex manner which is familiar from Aristophanes. Even the best
preser ved play of Menander, the Dyskolos, whose setting at a shrine of Pan and the
Nymphs in the mountainous Attic deme of Phyle might have been expected to exploit
and demand local knowledge of its audience, proves almost entirely devoid of
regional specificity. Rather, under the sign of Pan who grants fer tility to the flocks,
the play opposes a universal ideal of communality and social cohesion, expressed
through the idea of marriage and cultic practice, to the misanthrope Knemon's
rejection of society and impossible dream of autarky, based on his experience of
dog-eat-dog reality:
One mistake, perhaps, I did make ± I believed that I was the
One man in the world who could be self-contained (autarkes), and wouldn't require
Help from any man. However, I've seen now that death can strike
Suddenly and with no warning, and I've realised that my
Past belief was wrong. You always need someone who'll lend a hand,
Someone on the doorstep. By Hephaestus, I thought nobody
On this earth could show real friendship to another ± that's how far
Of f the rails I'd gone through studying all the dif ferent ways of life,
How men in their calculations angle for gain.
(Dyskolos 713±21, trans. Arnott)
So too, Daos' account in Aspis of the battle in which he believes his young master to
have been killed is geographically specific (`There is a river in L ykia called the
Xanthos . . . '), but nothing hangs on that specificity.
The foregrounded values of New Comedy are generosity in the broadest sense
(philanthropia), gentleness and self-knowledge. The opening of the Misoumenos
(`The Hated Man'), one of the most famous scenes of Menander in antiquity,
foreshadows the emergence of those vir tues in the play to come through the opening
presentation of the soldier Thrasonides, whose sexual restraint in the matter of his
captive Krateia marks him as wor thy eventually to become a full member of the citizen
body:
O Night ± for you've the largest share in sex
Of all the gods, and in your shades are spoken
Most words of love and thoughts charged with desire ±
482 Richard Hunter



Have you seen any other man more racked
With miser y? A lover more ill-starred?
Now either at my own front door I stand,
Here in the alley, or I saunter up
And down, when I could lie asleep
Till now, when you, O night, have nearly run
Half course, and clasp my love. She's in there ± in
My house, I've got the chance, I want it just
As much as the most ardent lover ± yet
I don't . . . I'd rather stand here shivering
Beneath a wintr y sky ± chatting to you!
(Misoumenos 1±14, trans. Arnott)
Old Comedy's concern with `real' persons was, however, taken over in the Hellenistic
age by the literature of anecdote. Some 470 verses sur vive (preser ved in Athenaeus'
Deipnosophistai) of the Chreiai (`Anecdotes') of the comic poet Machon of Corinth
or Sikyon. These verse anecdotes tell of the doings and witty sayings of cour tesans,
parasites and poets; great men are not absent (one or more Ptolemies, Demetrios
Poliorketes), but they are only rarely ver y impor tant to the anecdotes and are there
rather to make the anecdotes interesting by lending a flavour of `naughtiness in high
places'. Machon was probably active at Alexandria in the middle of the third centur y,
but the anecdotes of the Chreiai cover the period from the late fifth to the early third
centuries, and it is likely that Machon drew on the genre of proseChreiai, Apophtheg
mata and Apomnemoneumata which flourished from the later four th centur y on
(perhaps in par ticular the work of L ynkeus of Samos, the brother of the historian
Douris).
4 Alexandria and the Ptolemies
Much of what sur vives of elite third-centur y poetr y was written at Alexandria during
the reigns of the first three Ptolemies. The twin institutions of the `Museum' (lit.
`shrine of the Muses') and the Librar y (Pfeif fer 1968: 96±104; Fraser 1972: 312±35;
Erskine 1995), together with the fabulous wealth of the Ptolemies, ser ved as a magnet
to intellectuals, poets and scientists from all over the Greek world and simultaneously
marked the Ptolemies as the true heirs and preser vers of Greek cultural traditions.
There are, of course, many inter woven strands of tradition. The Ptolemies were, on
one hand, celebrated by poets as the true successors of Alexander and through him of
Herakles, the great civilizer (cf. Theocr. Id. 17.13±33); in another way, Alexandria
was the new Athens, i.e. the cultural and mercantile capital of the world. In the first
`mimiamb' of Herodas the bawd Gyllis seeks to persuade a younger friend that her
man has forgotten all about her in the midst of the delights of Alexandria:
The home of the goddess is there. For ever ything in the world that exists and is produced
is in Egypt: wealth, wrestling schools, power, tranquillity, fame, spectacles, philosophers,
gold, youths, the sanctuar y of the sibling gods, the King is an excellent chap, the
Museum, wine, ever y good thing he could desire, women, as many as by Hades' Maid
as the stars that heaven boasts of bearing . . . (Herodas 1.26±33, trans. Cunningham,
adapted)
Literature and its Contexts 483



So too, in Theocritus' Fifteenth Idyll the description of a Ptolemaic `spectacle'
(Arsinoe's festival in honour of Adonis) is combined with the representation of
Alexandria as a cosmopolis to which all the people and goods of the world flow
(Rowlandson, this volume, section 2).
The Ptolemaic dimension of some `Ptolemaic' poetr y is completely explicit. The
royal house figures in many contemporar y epigrams, and both Theocritus and
Callimachus draw an analogy between Apollo's bir th on Delos, as narrated in the
Homeric Hymn to Delos, and Philadelphos' birth on Kos (Theocr. Id. 17.58±76, Call
imachus Hymn to Delos 160±95); in Callimachus, in fact, Philadelphos' birth is
foretold by Apollo while still unborn in Leto's womb. In other texts, a more oblique
link with the royal house and with Ptolemaic ideology is a plausible hypothesis. Thus,
for example, the stor y of Heracles' strangling of the snakes and his early education in
Theocritus 24 has been attractively read as a way of imaging a Ptolemaic prince,
perhaps the young Philadelphos (Koenen 1977: 79±86; Grif fiths 1979: 91±8). The
only sur viving Hellenistic epic, the Argonautica of Apollonios of Rhodes, who ser ved
as Librarian of the Royal Librar y in the middle years of the centur y, takes the
Argonauts on an increasingly fantastic journey to the eastern edges of the Black Sea
and then back to Greece via central Europe, Italy and Nor th Africa; there are obvious
resonances of Alexander's eastern travels, but, more specifically, the Argonauts come
into contact with areas of considerable political interest to the Ptolemies ± the Aegean
islands, the Black Sea, Cyrenaica ± and the epic as a whole suggests the impor tant
themes of inter-cultural contact, Hellenization, and the widening intellectual and
physical horizons of the Hellenistic world (Hunter 1991; 1993: 152±69; 1995). The
present and recent past is ever ywhere in the religious and social practices of the poem,
and the foreshadowing of the present in the past is a technique which Apollonios
perhaps inherited from Pindar and Attic tragedy and which he bequeathed to Virgil.
More problematic has proved the attempt to find within Ptolemaic poetr y ideas
and narrative motifs which exploit Egyptian and pharaonic themes; the apparent lack
of interest of third-centur y Alexandrian scholarship in things Egyptian may seem to
discourage even searching for such material. Never theless, powerful arguments have
been advanced for seeing Egyptian patterns within par ticular poems which directly
concern the royal house, such as Callimachus' `Lock of Berenice' in which Berenice's
dedication of a lock of hair for the safe return of her `brother'-husband Euergetes
seems to exploit the mourning of Isis for Osiris (Koenen 1993; Selden 1998); in such
poems both Greek and Egyptian themes may resonate, thus inscribing the duality of
Ptolemaic kingship within the poem.
5 Writing the Past
The Eighteenth Idyll of Theocritus records an epithalamian which a choir of Spartan
maidens sang outside the wedding-chamber of Menelaos and Helen:
Now, in Sparta once, in the palace of golden-haired Menelaus,
There were girls who wound fresh hyacinths into their hair, and
Stepped into the dance outside his freshly painted bridal room ±
Twelve girls, from the city's foremost families, the great glor y of
Sparta's youthful womanhood, at the time when Atreus' younger son,
484 Richard Hunter



Successful in his wooing, had locked the doors on them with his
Adored Helen, daughter of Tyndareus. So the girls sang in unison,
And moved their feet to the dance's complex measures,
While all the palace echoed to the sound of their wedding hymn.
(Theocr. Id. 18.1±8, trans. Verity)
The sense of a distant pastness (`once upon a time') which per vades the poem extends
to both subject-matter and form. As early as Homer, Menelaos and his comrades
belong to an earlier, stronger, and more `heroic' generation than `men of the present
day', and Hesiod (Works and Days 156±73) had assigned the heroes of the Trojan war
to the `divine race of hero men, who are called ``demigods'' ' and had expressed regret
that he lived in a degenerate present; for the poets of the third centur yB C , however,
Homer and Hesiod were themselves paradigmatic icons of a now distant past. In
another poem, Idyll 16 in honour of Hieron of Syracuse, the poet pictures potential
patrons who conceal their miserliness behind the existence of Homer: `Who
would listen to another poet? Homer is enough for all.' The irony of the presentation
should not conceal the urgency of the question: the undying fame which Homer
conferred upon the characters of his poems (Theocr. Id. 16.48±57, 17.116±20) both
of fered the prime example of the power of poetr y, but was also an ever-present
reminder of the seeming impossibility of measuring up to the past.
The Eighteenth Idyll also recreates an apparently past world of Spar tan maiden
songs, that world most familiar to us from the lyric poetr y of Alkman. The sacred
geography of Spartan legend shapes the rite which the choir foretells that it will
per form in Helen's honour:
As for us, early tomorrow we'll go to the flowering
Meadows where we race, to pick scented garlands, full of
Memories of you, as suckling lambs long for their mothers' teats.
We shall be the first to plait for you a wreath of ground-loving
Clover to hang on a shady plane-tree, and we shall be the first
To make an offering of gleaming oil, dripped from our silver flasks,
Under that plane tree's shade. In its bark we shall cut these words, that
Passers-by may read its Dorian message: `Respect me; I am Helen's tree'.
(Theocr. Id. 18.39±48, trans. Verity)
This appeal to a reader's power to imagine the (real or believed) cult of remote places
or times, combined with an interest in the origins, the `aetiology', of that cult is one
of the most power ful currents which run through Hellenistic literature. The urge to
catalogue and record does not, of course, of itself imply recognition of impending
loss ± not all archaeology and anthropology is of the `rescue' variety ± but, like the
collection of rare and dialect words (`glosses') which flourished in third-centur y
scholarship, such practices can themselves define an area of `otherness', which
reinforces a sense of dif ference from the world of the reader.
This sense of `otherness', of the conjuring of a world which is no longer ours,
ought in fact to be connected to the ver y nature of literature in the Hellenistic world.
The spread of higher-level literacy, a flourishing book trade and the growth of
libraries and scholarly activity meant that works were now composed with an `inter
national' audience in mind, an audience bound together by a sense of a common
Literature and its Contexts 485



cultural and intellectual heritage which expressed itself, in par t, through a displayed
interest ± which today might be termed, somewhat misleadingly, `antiquarian' ± in
the local traditions and stories of the whole Greek world. Callimachus' most influen
tial and famous poem, the Aitia, a treatment in four books and perhaps some 6000
elegiac verses of the origins of customs and cults from all over the Greek world, is the
most power ful and impor tant witness to these developments. The great centres of
cultural and (sometimes) political power ± Alexandria, Pergamon, Athens, Pella,
Antioch ± became the market-places in which such knowledge was exchanged and
membership of this intellectual elite confirmed.
Although such exchange now regularly took place through the medium of ex
changed writing, there was a real continuity, which is not to be underestimated,
however much it was also exaggerated and to some extent constructed by the elite
themselves, between these practices and the sympotic world of intellectual and
cultural exchange depicted by archaic poets and the narratives of Herodotos. Perhaps
the best illustration of this is the episode (fr. 178 Pf.) in the Aitia in which the poet
meets Theogenes, a visitor to Alexandria from the Aegean island of Ikos (modern
Alonnisos); he meets him at a symposium at the house of Pollis, an Athenian who
keeps all the celebrations of the Athenian sacred calendar, though living in Alexandria.
Theogenes and the poet are `two of a kind', interested in intellectual conversation
which wears the elite badge of allusion to famous texts of Homer and Hesiod (Hunter
1996b; Fantuzzi and Hunter 2002: 97±104). Unlike Theogenes, however, Callimachus
stays in Alexandria and gathers the tales of those who pass through or (what amounts
to the same thing) whose books reach the Librar y ± an Odysseus who `saw the cities
of many men and came to know their minds' (or, with Zenodotos, `customs'),
but whose journeys are those of the mind. So too, the festivals which Pollis
nostalgically re-creates in a `foreign' city doubtless remained for him and some of
his guests markers of Athenian identity, as they were in their true home, but
par ticipation in them now marks as well a broader, more `international' form of
identity.
6 The Real and the Written
As early as the latter par t of the fifth centur y there is evidence for the gradual
dissolution of the Greek `song culture' and its replacement in par t by a `book culture'
and in par t by a new kind of specialist music culture in the hands of exper ts and
vir tuosi whose performances were no longer necessarily tied to specific performance
occasions, whether public festivals or private celebrations. Cer tainly, by the end of the
fifth centur y the great age of choral poetr y was over, and most poetr y of the high
Alexandrian period is in unaccompanied dactylic hexameters or elegiac couplets. The
two crucial per formative contexts for high poetr y were now recitation, whether to
one's fellow poets or at the cour t of a patron or at a public poetr y festival, and
reading. The `internationalization' of literature, together with this dual loss of the
original nexus between words, music and metre and of the specific, often local
per formance context of (particularly lyric) poetr y led not only to the standardization
of poetic form, but also to a radical liberation of poets from the, par tly self-imposed,
tyranny of convention determined by geography and occasion. No set of texts
illustrates these phenomena as brilliantly as Callimachus' Hymns.
486 Richard Hunter



Callimachus inherited a broad and permeable distinction between hexameter
poems of the kind which have sur vived for us as the `Homeric hymns', which were
probably per formed in much the same context as epic narrative, and the lyric, choral
hymns which formed par t of cultic performance. In the changed circumstances of the
third centur y, in which grand lyric poetr y of the old style was no longer possible,
Callimachus recuperated the experience of the cultic per formance of poetr y by
writing three of his hymns (to Apollo, Athena and Demeter) as `scripts' being
per formed during a religious ceremony; in Apollo and Athena the celebrants, respect
ively at an unspecified rite (though perhaps the Karneia at Callimachus' native city of
Cyrene) and at an Argive ceremony in which the image of Athena was bathed in the
river, are waiting for the epiphany of the god (or his or her image), and in theDemeter
the female celebrants are taking par t in a sacred procession on a day of fasting, such as
is familiar from the Athenian `Thesmophoria'. These `scripts' elaborate the self
reference of the early hymns to the choir and the festival in a way that was unnecessar y
when the hymns actually were par t of a per formance (Depew 2000; Fuhrer and
Hunter 2002). Here are the openings of the hymns to Apollo and Athena:
How Apollo's laurel sapling shook, how the whole
Temple shook with it! Back, back, all who have sinned!
The doors are rattling: it must be
Apollo striking them with his gleaming foot.
Can't you see? All of a sudden
The Delian palm nodded with joy, and now
The swan is singing, high in the air, his lovely song.
Up now, bars, swing free of the gates!
Let them go, bolts: the god is no longer distant.
And you, young men, begin the singing and dancing.
(Hymn to Apollo 1±8, trans. Nisetich)
All who pour water for the bath of Pallas,
Come out, come out! Just now I heard
The mares of the goddess whinny: she too
Is anxious to go! Hurr y, then,
Blond daughters of Pelasgia, hurr y.
(Hymn to Athena 1±4, trans. Nisetich)
The scripted excitement is, on one hand, a recognition that listening to a recitation or
reading a text are modes of engagement which are clearly dif ferent from actually
taking par t in a ceremony, but it also celebrates the extraordinar y power of `the
mind's eye' to envision the absent.
A similar celebration is an impor tant par t of the prominent place in Hellenistic
poetr y held by descriptions of (real or imaginar y) works of ar t: a mar vellously
sculpted wooden bowl in Theocritus' First Idyll, the richly decorated cloak which
Jason wears to meet Hypsipyle in the first book of Apollonios' Argonautica, the

representational ar t itself (Pollitt 1986: 141±7) have contributed to these passages,
which are, however, also to be connected with the new impor tance of reading and the
demands upon the imagination that this brings with it. This `ecphrastic' style may also
occur in narrative which does not explicitly purpor t to describe a work of ar t. In
Theocritus 22 the Dioskouroi come upon Amykos, king of the Bebr ykians, as they are
wandering away from the other Argonauts to admire the beauties of nature:
There,
At the foot of a smooth clif f, they found an ever-flowing spring,
Brimming with pure water; in its depths pebbles gleamed, as if
Made of cr ystal or silver. Around it grew tall pines, poplars,
And plane trees, and leaf-crowned cypresses, and fragrant flowers,
Such as carpet meadows at the end of spring and summon hair y bees
To cheerful husbandr y. There sat a giant of a man, taking his ease
In the sun. He was an awesome spectacle: his ears were thickened
By blows from leather mitts, and his huge chest and broad back swelled
Like the iron flesh of a hammered statue. Where his shoulders and hard arms
Met, the muscles jutted out like rounded boulders, polished smooth
By the whirling onrush of a winter torrent. A lion's skin, tied by its paws,
Hung from his neck and over his back.
(Theocr. Id. 22.37±52, trans. Verity)
We see both the pool and Amykos with the eyes of the Dioskouroi, here depicted as
`outsiders', tourists with refined and modern aesthetic sensibilities (v.36). What they
(and thus we) `see' is a pool which conforms to the most verdant beauties of thelocus
amoenus (Hunter 1999: 12±17), i.e. a description shaped by prior texts and one
which foregrounds the mediating role of the poet, and a man who resembles the
figures of `realistic' Hellenistic statuar y, such as the famous `Terme boxer' (Pollitt
1986: 145±7; Hunter 1996a: 62±3; figure 28.1). More broadly, the juxtaposition of
the narratives of Polydeukes and Kastor in Idyll 22 displays two apparently opposed
modes of representation, one which emphasizes techne and kosmos, `art' and `artificial
ity' ± the passage just considered, the unparalleled stichomythia in hexameters which
follows ± and one (the Kastor narrative) which seems to be an experiment in almost
`unmediated' narrative. In this juxtaposition lies a further exploration of the new
possibilities of book literature.
The fluctuation in Hellenistic texts between the description of `real', often famous,
works of ar t and the creation of imaginar y ar tefacts within the text is one manifest
ation of a persistent concern with the closeness or distance of `literar y' experience
from `lived' experience; this concern is in par t a result of the new contexts of
reception and of the growth of the idea of literature as a discrete area of activity
and one whose enjoyment is a mark of inclusion in a par ticular cultural group.
Inclusion, however, also involves the exclusion of `others', and the frequency with
which elite Hellenistic literature depicts the lives of `ordinar y people', i.e. the ex
cluded, may be taken as a further manifestation of the changed functioning of written
texts. There was, of course, ample archaic and classical precedent in, for example,
Homer's Eumaios and the low life of Ionian iambus, but the new prominence of such
characters seems clear, even after ever y allowance for the chanciness of sur vival
(G. Zanker 1987). The lives of `ordinar y' people are described in ver y `unordinar y'

Literature and its Contexts 489



this poem, and the description of her rustic life and the traditional peasant fare she set
before Theseus was for later antiquity the most famous par t of Callimachus' poem (cf.
Ovid's tale of Baucis and Philemon, Met. 8.626 f f.). Ver y similar is the depiction of
the peasant Molorkos in the so-called `Victoria Berenices' (Supp. Hell. 254±269),
which opened the third book of Callimachus' Aitia; this poem is an epinician-style
(though elegiac) celebration of victor y at the Nemean Games by a chariot team
entered by Queen Berenice, the Cyrenean wife of Ptolemy Euergetes. At the centre
of the poem stood the stor y of how Heracles, on his way to fight the Nemean lion,
was humbly enter tained at Kleonai by Molorkos; on returning to Molorkos after
killing the lion, Heracles related a prophecy of Athena regarding the crowning of
future victors in the Nemean and Isthmian Games. In this poem, too, Heracles'
heroic feat is displaced from the centre of interest by the description of Molorkos'
rustic life. Even the battle with the Nemean lion took second place to Molorkos'
constant and `epic' struggle with mice (Supp. Hell. 259.5±33 fr. 177 Pf.).
In the Hekale and the `Victoria Berenices' the ef fect of such material depends upon
the fact that it appears within a conventionally `high' poetic context. Other texts,
however, claim a representational purchase upon `real life', such as the mime texts of
Theocritus (Id. 2, 14, 15) and Herodas, in which a clash between subject-matter
(`ordinar y', often rather `sordid' lives) and form (Theocritus' hexameters and the
choliambs and archaizing literar y Ionic of Herodas) problematizes the kind of realism
on show, as also does the ironic distance created by the fact that the characters are
female, but the audience of the poetr y almost cer tainly largely male. Moreover, it is
not simply through a common debt to the mime tradition that both Theocritus 15
and Herodas 4 confront their characters with the `realism' of representational ar t
(Goldhill 1994: 216±23). In Idyll 15 Gorgo and Praxinoa admire the tapestries in the
royal palace at Alexandria:
Lady Athena, to think of the weaving that went into them!
Such ar tists, to make their designs appear so true to life.
How naturally the figures stand, how naturally they move!
They seem alive, not woven. Ah, what a clever creature man is!
And how wonder fully he reclines on his silver couch,
With the first downy growth spreading from his temples:
Thrice-adored Adonis, adored even beside Acheron.
(Theocr. Id. 15.80±86, trans. Verity)
In Herodas 4 two women admire famous works of ar t in a temple of Asklepios:
Don't you see, dear Kynno, what works are here! You would say that Athene car ved these
lovely things ± greetings, Lady. This naked boy, if I scratch him, won't he have a wound,
Kynno? For the flesh is laid on him in the painting, pulsing like warm springs. And the
silver fire-tongs, if Myellos or Pataikiskos son of Lamprion sees them, won't they lose
their eyes thinking they are really made of silver? And the ox, and the man leading it, and
the woman following, and this hook-nosed man and the one with his hair sticking up,
don't they all have the look of life and day? If I didn't think I was acting too boldly for a
woman, I should have cried out, in case the ox might do me some harm: he glances
sideways so, Kynno, with the one eye. (Herodas 4. 56±71, trans. Cunningham)
490 Richard Hunter



The temptation to see in these passages a kind of self-reflexive parody of the simple
platitudes of both literar y and ar t criticism is strengthened by a fur ther ecphrasis in
the sixth mimiamb. In this poem two women discuss a maker of mar vellous leather
dildoes; in vv. 65±73 his products are described:
His work, what work it is! You would think you were seeing the handiwork of Athene,
not Kerdon; when I saw them ± for he came with two, Metro ± my eyes swelled out at
first sight; men do not make stands ± we are alone ± so straight; and not only that, but
their smoothness is sleep, and the little straps are wool, not straps; if you look for another
cobbler better disposed to a woman, you will not find one. (Herodas 6.65±73, trans.
Cunningham)
The possibility that the virgin goddess Athena might have been interested in dildoes is
cer tainly not recorded elsewhere, but the claim that these artificial aids are `better
than the real thing' exploits the rhetoric of ecphrasis in brilliant new directions. Can
ar t do `nature's work' better than nature herself?
The Hellenistic appeal to `realism' is thus a function of the place of `literature' in
elite society. It is also, of course, always subject to the constraints of genre, and the
third centur y saw the creation of at least one new genre in which the construction of
nature by ar t was central. Theocritus' hexameter Bucolics present themselves as
elaborate literar y versions of a song-culture alive in the traditions of illiterate shep
herds and goatherds in the countr yside of the Greek west and the islands. Implicit,
then, in this new genre is a literar y-historical construction analogous to Aristotle's
tracing of the origin of tragedy and comedy to less formalized song traditions ( Poetics
1449a9±14), and it is ver y dif ficult to accept any simplistic explanation for the
emergence of bucolic in a desire to find relief from the pressures of life in the large
conurbations of the Hellenistic world. On the other hand, these poems can, with
hindsight, be seen as ver y significant texts in the histor y of the imagination of the
countr yside as a separate space of emotional, par ticularly erotic, experience. One of
the most haunting of all Greek poems, Theocritus' `Thalysia' (Id. 7), describes a walk
`away from the town' into a song-filled landscape where the narrator meets an
extraordinar y goatherd who has many of the attributes of the divine. The pattern is
familiar enough ± we may think of Philippides' meeting with Pan in the wilds of the
Peloponnese (Hdt. 6.105) ± but the emphasis upon the beauty of the countr yside
and the search for respite from the ache of longing were to have permanent influence
upon the western pastoral tradition (Hunter 1999: 12±17).
7 All for Love
The apparent prominence of eros, including the emotional torments of women, in
Hellenistic poetr y has often been remarked. Here again, of course, we are at the
mercy of the chances of sur vival. The erotic epigrams of Asklepiades, Callimachus,
Disocorides and others are the knowing heirs of the sympotic lyric (Anakreon etc.)
and elegy (Theognis etc.) of the archaic period, and eros is never far from the
symposium. The emotions are, like ever ything, the object of second-order reflection
in this self-conscious poetr y: thus a poem (AP 12.17 HE 988±91), which may be
Literature and its Contexts 491



by Asklepiades or Poseidippos, contrasts the pleasures and pains of homo- and
heterosexual desire and love-making, a theme familiar from Plato and Xenophon.
There is some evidence that, in par ticular contexts, poets could treat paederastic
desire as a phenomenon of the inherited past (cf. Theocr. Id. 12, 13, 28, 29, Hunter
1996a: 167±95), though this does not (of course) necessarily make heterosexual
desire itself a marker of `modernity'. What is perhaps new is the elaboration with
which male poets are prepared to lay bare their helplessness, dramatized in the
recurrent motif of the komos to the beloved's door (S. TarÂ an 1979), before the
onslaught of desire (of all kinds); whether conclusions can be drawn from this poetic
motif about changes in notions of masculinity is at least doubtful, but it is cer tain that
it is within Hellenistic poetr y that the origins of an impor tant element of the
ambiguous personae of the Roman elegists is to be sought.
Female characters (whether in love or not) play central roles in what sur vives of
Hellenistic poetr y: Apollonios' depiction of Medea's infatuation with Jason and her
terrifying anxiety on the journey back, Moschos' wittily naive Europa, the chattering
`housewives' of Herodas and Theocritus, Simaitha's confused emotions and magical
practices, set of f by her knowing self-presentation as the wronged innocent, in
Theocritus' Second Idyll, and Callimachus' exploration of maternal grief and discom
for t in the Hymns to Athena and Demeter are memorable creations. This female
prominence has often been associated with an increasing legal and social freedom of,
at least, elite women in the Hellenistic period and the political influence wielded (so it
is claimed) by the leading women of the royal houses. Over-interpretation is a
constant danger here. Thus, for example, it would be dif ficult to draw sociological
conclusions from Apollonios' brilliantly funny depiction of the all-female assembly at
Lemnos, where physical desire and `rational' argument happily flow together (as they
often do in politics), and it is far from clear that Simaitha's `for wardness' in `making
the first move' towards Delphis is a manifestation of a new-found female freedom
rather than a marker of her dependent social position; the literar y strategy by which
the gender roles in a standard erotic narrative are par tly reversed (itself perhaps to be
associated with the poem's af filiations to the mime) ought not, by itself, to be taken as
evidence of large-scale social change. A principal conceit of Theocritus' poem, the fact
that the male `seduction speech' (cf., e.g., Archilochos' `Cologne Epode') is given in
direct speech but as recollected and repor ted by the female (Andrews 1996), perhaps
tells us more about the interest of Hellenistic poetr y in experimentation with voice
than it does about female consciousness. Never theless, the profusion of female voices
in Hellenistic poetr y and the exploration of female emotion and desire in a depth
which is foreshadowed only sporadically in earlier poetr y (Sappho, Euripides'
Hippolytus etc.) perhaps reflects and cer tainly implies a heightened sense of female
identity (in a broad sense). We never really know what Nausikaa feels, but Apollonios
leaves us in no doubt about the long night of Medea's soul:
But on Medea sweet sleep could get no hold, kept
Wakeful as she was by worr ying over Jason
In her longing for him, and dreading the great might of the bulls
That would bring him an ill fate there on Ares' ploughland.
Close and quick now beat the hear t in her bosom,
As a shaft of sunlight will dance along the house wall

CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
Hellenistic Art, A D 1500±2000
Andrew Stewart
1 Whose Laokoon?
When I think of Hellenistic ar t (which is often) I think of the Laokoon (figures 29.1
and 29.3). The study of Hellenistic ar t in the second millennium begins and ends
with it. No single work of ancient ar t has been more fer tile or more controversial (cf.
Bieber 1942/1967; Brilliant 2000). So I want to use it as a springboard for a
millennial Ringkomposition. After sketching its histor y, I want to outline the develop
ment and present state of the field as a whole, ending with three examples of the ways
in which it is currently moving ± the Laokoon being number 3.
Writing in A D 77, Pliny the Elder locates the Laokoon `in the house of the
imperator Titus' and judges it `superior to all other works of painting and sculpture'
(HN 36.37). He attributes it to the vir tuoso Rhodian sculptors Hagesandros, Atha
nodoros and Polydoros, who had allegedly car ved it all from a single mighty block of
stone. Yet frustratingly, he omits to date it.
Discovered in Rome on 14 Januar y 1506, at once identified as Pliny's and Titus'
ver y statue, and swiftly installed in the Cor tile del Belvedere of the Vatican, the
Laokoon immediately captivated the Renaissance imagination. For the first time an
ancient masterpiece had appeared that was apparently well documented and even
complemented a `classic' poetic text: Virgil's description of the Sack of Troy inAeneid
Book 2. Recognized as the supreme exemplum doloris and soon enthroned at the
centre of the paragone debate (the contest over the relative merits of painting and
sculpture), in 1533 the group was restored in proto-`baroque' fashion by Giovanni
Montorsoli with Laokoon's right arm extended towards the sky (figure 29.1). When
in 1550 Vasari selected it and the Belvedere Torso as the two seminal works of his
terza maniera (Vasari 1550: Vol. 4.1: 7, ed. Barocchi) ± the High Renaissance style of
which Michelangelo was the supreme exponent ± its canonization was complete.
Two centuries later, the pioneering ar t historian J. J. Winckelmann (1717±68)
followed Pliny in making the group the culmination of ancient art in hisGeschichte der
Kunst des Alterthums (Winckelmann 1764). Arguing that Laokoon sighs rather than
screams, Winckelmann categorized him (oddly to our eyes) as the epitome of `noble

neg. IX.27.27
simplicity and quiet grandeur' and dated him to the `beautiful' or late classic period of
the four th centur y B C . Almost immediately, however, the critic G. E. Lessing (1729±
81) published a brilliant essay entitled Laokoon: Oder, U
È
ber die Grenzen der Mahlerey
und Poesie (1766) that challenged this chronology. Arguing that the group was based
on Virgil and Roman in date, he used their two narratives to revisit the ancient rivalr y
between text and image. To him, Laokoon's restraint was not merely classical but a
matter of ar tistic decorum. Ar t histor y and art criticism had begun to par t company.

Figure 29.2

From Alter tu Èmer von Pergamon
In the nineteenth centur y this debate over chronology sharpened, as archaeologists
excavated the Great Altar of Pergamon and its baroque-style Gigantomachy frieze
(figure 29.2), discovered inscriptions recording other works by the Hagesandros
family, began to sort out the sequence of Hellenistic sculptural styles, and quietly
jettisoned Winckelmann's chronology.
In the great project of classification that now engrossed the field, the Laokoon's
correct placement was of critical impor tance. Should it belong with the Great Altar
around 170 B C , as its `baroque' style implied? (The Altar's excavator, Alexander
Conze, had even exclaimed when it was found, `Now we've got our own Laokoon!')
Or should one trust its flat, `one-sided' composition and its sculptors' reconstructed
family tree and date it much later? Is it truly a baroque original or a sheep in wolf 's
clothing ± a reproduction announcing an extended baroque revival? Is it a product of
the Hellenistic world's zenith, of its long twilight, or even of Imperial Rome?
In 1960 fresh evidence re-energized the debate. A new restoration by Filippo Magi
(Magi 1960; figure 29.3) confirmed that pace Pliny the three sculptors had used no
fewer than seven blocks of marble. One, at the back of the altar upon which Laokoon
sits, came from an Italian quarr y at Carrara which was not opened until Augustan
times ± but could be a repair. Magi also replaced Montorsoli's upraised arm with a

flexed one discovered in a Roman stonemason's shop in 1906, and moved the right
hand son further away from his father. So is this boy escaping? If so, the Rhodians'
source cannot have been the Aeneid, where all three die.
Almost simultaneously, a seaside cave at a villa at Sperlonga (midway between
Rome and Naples) yielded a huge cache of sculptures in the same style as the
Laokoon. One of the groups was even signed by the same three Rhodians, but with
dif ferent patronymics than previously conjectured (Conticello and Andreae 1974;
figure 29.4). At first identified as fragments of another Laokoon, these new-found
marbles were soon attributed to no fewer than four groups featuring Odysseus
(rescuing Achilles' body at Troy, tr ying to steal the Trojan Palladion from Diomedes,
escaping from Skylla, and blinding Polyphemos).

by Hom er and the C yclic ep ics; or by so me othe r so urce? Were they and the Laokoo n
merely super b rep licas of lost, Hig h Hell enistic bronzes? When did their sculptors
live? And so on.
At the end of the mil lennium the patter n has repeated itself. A su mptuous conf er
ence volume has treated the Laokoo n in its V atic an cont ext (W inner 1998). Two
scholars have independe ntly proposed a new interp retatio n of it, one text-b ased and
the other from autopsy (Lahus en 1999; Queyre l 1997 [publi shed 2001] ). A third has
produced a string of mon ographs on it, Sperlo nga and Rome (A ndreae 1987; 1988 ;
1991b; 1994; 199 9). A four th, following W inckelm ann and Lessin g, exam ines its
contribut ion to `the aest hetics of pain' (Richte r 1992). A fif th of fers a post moder n
treatmen t of the disc ourses that have shaped it across the cent uries (Bril liant 2000).
A reviewer of his (Mar y Beard, TLS, 2 Febr uar y 2001: 3±4 ) doubts whether the `new'
ar m belon gs; and two other sceptics a rgue that it is not Pliny's Laokoo n anyway
(Alber tson 1993; Koor tbojian 2000).

498 Andrew Stewart



is Winckelmann's and Lessing's; Laokoon III is Magi's; and Laokoon IV is Brilliant's
own.
Scholars have long questioned the group's findspot as well. For the Renaissance
accounts only place it `near' the holding tanks of Trajan's Baths (the so-called Sette
Sale) on the Esquiline, in a richly embellished room six bracchia (3.5 m) below
ground. This area was par t of the gardens of Augustus' favorite savant and Virgil's
patron, Maecenas. Over the centuries, scholars have placed its findspot almost ever y
where on the hill, even (quite wrongly) in Nero's Golden House. Indeed, since the
Flavian emperors lived on the Quirinal, more than a kilometre away, some have
argued that our Laokoon is not Pliny's and Titus' at all (Alber tson 1993; Koor tbojian
2000; cf. S.H.A. Tyr. Trig. 33; cf. Suet. Dom. 1). Finally, Pliny's Laokoon was `made
from one stone', but ours is made from several, and by 1600 at least four more
alleged Laokoons (all now lost) had appeared in Rome.
Yet in A D 77, when Pliny published his Natural Histor y, dedicated it to the
imperator Titus and placed the Laokoon in his house (HN 36.37), Titus was indeed
merely imperator (`crown prince') and not yet emperor, so he could have been living
anywhere (Haeuber 1991; Haeuber, for thcoming). Suggestively, when Tiberius had
returned from exile in A D 2 as Augustus' designated successor, he lived in the Gardens
of Maecenas (Suet. Tib. 15.1). Yet even so, we still do not know exactly where our
Laokoon was found, whether it belonged to a larger sculptural program, when to date
it, and whether Maecenas himself or someone else commissioned it.
Yet as so often in archaeology a stalemate on one front has been countered by a
major advance on another. Examination of Laokoon's eyes in raking light has shown
that they still retain traces of paint but that their irises apparently have no pupils
(Queyrel 1997; 2002). Laokoon is neither `seeking help from a higher power' as
Winckelmann thought nor callously turning away from his stricken sons as others
later argued. He is probably blind. As one scholar has argued independently of
this star tling discover y (Lahusen 1999), his pose and agonized demeanour best fit
the only extant text that describes him thus: Quintus of Smyrna's third centur y A D
epic the Posthomerica. In a long passage (12.389±497) that must be based on some
earlier but still unidentified source, Quintus attributes the injur y to a vengeful
Athena:
Then even as from destruction shrank the lads,
Those deadly fangs had seized and ravined up
Them both, outstretching to their father dear
Their pleading hands: no power to help had he.
(12. 474±77; trans. Loeb Classical Librar y)
Yet Quintus cannot be describing the Vatican statue itself, for while his Laokoon
escapes with his life, the marble one just as clearly will not.
This new twist in the plot suggests that our Laokoon is pre-Virgilian, since after his
Aeneid was published in 19 B C his version of the tale immediately became canonical at
Rome. It places its manufacture within the lifetime of Maecenas (c. 70±8 B C ), Virgil's
patron, it catapults Laokoon's status as the supreme exemplum doloris to an entirely
dif ferent level, and it opens up exciting new avenues of interpretation. A seer who
cannot see; a prophet of doom whose prophecy dooms him; a truth-teller whose tale

is a classic misstep (hamartia/error) that brings on his own destruction ± this is
the stuf f of Greek tragedy at its most classic. I will return to it at the end of this
chapter.
The Laokoon's stor y in the second millennium A D , then, is the stor y of Hellenistic
art in microcosm. For both are:
. Protean (the Laokoon is simultaneously both `baroque' and `classic', Hellenistic
and Roman);
. Geographically fuzzy (this acknowledged masterpiece of Hellenistic ar t was found
in Rome and was perhaps made for Romans);
. Chronologically precarious;
. Open-ended;
. Inter textual;
. Slipper y; and
. Unpredictable.
Now for attempts to bring this ar t to order.
2 `Bricks in the Edifice of Knowledge'
In 1865 the German ar t historian Heinrich Brunn (1822±94) gave a lecture to the
German Archaeological Institute in Rome. In one brief hour he rescued a key
monument of Hellenistic sculpture ± the so-called Lesser Attalid Dedication on the
Athenian Acropolis ± from 1500 years of oblivion. Using plaster casts, Brunn put
together nine small marble statues of defeated, wounded and dead barbarians: a Gaul
in Paris; a Giant, Amazon, Persian, and Gaul in Naples; a Persian in the Vatican;
and three Gauls in Venice (figure 29.5, cf. Stewart for thcoming a; Otto Benndor f
added a tenth statue, a Persian in Aix, in 1876). Brunn saw that in scale and subject

Athenians' battle against the Amazons; the Persian af fair at Marathon; and the Gauls'
destr uction in Mysia. Each figure is about two cubits high.
Assign ing the monume nt to the fir st King Attalos of Perg amon (regn. , 241±197
BC
),
Br unn dated it to the year 200, when the Macedonia ns were ravaging Attica like
barbarians and threatening the city's ver y exist ence. In his ensuin g pub lication
(Br unn 1870) he added so me new ancient testimo nia, discus sed alter native recon
str uctions of the mon ument an d eva luated othe r possi ble attribut ions to it. Final ly , he
sketched a histor y of the `Pe rgame ne Schoo l' of sculpture . He ex amined what Pl iny
and othe rs had said about its practitione rs, especi ally the bronz ecasters Isig onus (a
textual cor r uption for the Epigonus of HN 34.88?), P[h]y romachus , Stratonicus and
Antigonus who `did the battle s of Attalus and Eum enes against the Gaul s' ( HN
34.8 4), and brought key works such as the Suicidal (Ludov isi) and C apitoline
Gauls , Barber ini Faun and Marsy as/U f fizi Scyth into its orbit.
All this represen ted a real breakt hrough, especia lly because it concer ned no t
Classical ar t, which Br unn had already done much to map, but the terra incognita
of Hell enistic ar t. Pliny had stigmatized most of the per iod as ar tistically bar ren ( HN
34.5 2), alle ging that bronz e sc ulpture `stopped' in 292
BC
and resumed only in 156
in the h ands of `in ferior' ar tists. The word `Hell enistic' had b een coine d only thir ty
years before ; works attributed to the period wer e few and vir tually unrese arched; and
Perg amon's trea sure-tro ve of ar chitectur e and sc ulpture was still undiscov ered. Yet at
one stroke Br unn had fo und a major Perg amene mon ument , attribut ed it, pi npointed
it to the yea r and co ntextual ized it: a milestone in a chaot ic and jum bled landscap e.
Br unn was a posi tivist. Since positiv ism in some for m has dom inated the study of
Helleni stic ar t ever since, but n ow is often us ed as a ter m of abuse, it is good to be
clear about what it mea nt in mid ninete enth- centur y Ger many . As Richard Popki n
(1999: 668) has rem arked:
The ter m `positivism' is semantically slipper y since its original referent, the philosophy of
Auguste Comte and his disciples which promulgated a systematic religion of humanity ,
was quickly replaced, especially in Ger many , by any view that restricted knowledge to
what could be attained using the methods of obser vation, induction, and mathematical
analysis found, paradigmatically , in the empirical science of nature.
Br unn' s lecture of 18 65 was a classic expositi on of the se prin ciples. As Donal d
Prez iosi (1989: 82) ex plains:
The moder n discipline of ar t histor y might be viewed in one sense as a reaction, within the
frameworks of the nineteenth-centur y dreams of scientificity , to the Romanticist entangle
ments with the double binds of the intentional-af fective fallacies, resulting in a displace
ment of the problematics of production and reception beyond the pur view of the new
for malist, historicist science . . . [It] endeavored to demonstrate that its practice was as
disciplined and rigorous as any other academically instituted science . . . by mounting a
discourse that was tough-minded, logical, detached, objective, and grounded in exper tise.
Hellenistic Art, A D 1500±2000 501



So in Foucauldian te r ms this new dis course was a technolo gy of powe r . It program
matical ly replaced opinion with fact, fa ncy with evidenc e, speculation with induct ion,
dilettant ism with exper tise and ro mantici sm with scienc e.
Any reader of Br unn' s essay (Br unn 1870) is ins tantly impre ssed by his careful
autopsy of the o riginals and by his painstak ing accum ulation of plaste r casts, ancient
texts and Rena issance docum ents to build his thes is. But his for midable research skills
should not oversh adow his unriva lled comm and of posi tivist me thodolog y . W itne ss
his for thright and sober stat ements of prin ciple; his discrim inating, rigor ous and
objective applicat ion of materi al, fo r mal an d histo rical analy sis; and his end result ±
a tightly reasone d and historically plaus ible cons tr uct compl ete with its own criteria
for inclusi on and exclusio n. T o use a favourit e positivist metapho r, he had indeed
contribut ed a brick ± indeed, a whole course of br icks ± to the edific e of know ledge .
Y et the metho d had defini te limit ations.
Under the influe nce of ninete enth-cen tur y scientism and the great traditio n of
mimetic a r t cr iticism from Xenokrat es ( c. 300
BC
), Pliny the Eld er (
AD
2 3±79), and
V asari (1511±74 ) through W incke lmann, it attr ibuted an equal ly empiricist and
evolut ionist charact er to the ar tworks it studi ed. It as sumed that Gre ek ar t sought
natura lism or realism (rarely disti nguishing them) above all else and grad ually evo lved
towards this goal. But although ever ybody agre ed that this proc ess climaxed in the
Helleni stic period, their ideal ist bias led them to priv ilege Pheidi an c lassicism a bove
all else. T he summit of per fect ion in the visual ar ts, the Pheidi an style was enthrone d
as the A ristotelian mean between the two extre mes of the `primitiv e' Arc haic and the
`degener ate' Helleni stic.
Strict positivism also entaile d other distress ing consequ ences , ofte n collecti vely
ter med the `positivist fa llacy'. It s `sci entific' fo cus upon the objec ts ± upon what
sur viv es ± immediat ely tur ned the histo rian into a Doubt ing T homas: tr uly the Ur
positivist ! For strict posi tivists must either assume that ar tefacts are both archaeo
logicall y and historically significant in propor tion to their rate of sur vival or stop
extrapol ating from them a ltogether . Y et most ancient material cultur e is ir retrievab ly
lost, includ ing whole class es of ar tefa cts like H ellenistic pan el-painting s, clothing and
traged ies. Sur vival ra tes for the rest are utterly lopsided and of ten inve rsely related to
their value in antiquit y . (For exam ple, we have vast quantiti es of potter y and b arely a
scrap of any gold and ivor y stat ue.) Though some impor tant sur vivals were pre
selected by the ancie nts themse lves, this was not because they were ty pical but
because they wer e consider ed special or collecti ble ± like seven traged ies each of
Aeschy lus, Sopho cles and Euripides, and the dozen Helleni stic erotic grou ps rep ro
duced in Roman copy . The thou sands of Hell enistic privat e por traits in bro nze
known from inscribe d bases and decre es, on the other hand, generated n o copies
and are utt erly lost, all having bee n melt ed down; like wise the victors from Br u nn's
Attalid d edicatio n (f igure 29 .5).
So strictly posi tivist interp retations (whi ch Br u nn's was not) are nece ssarily minim
alist an d timid. By refusing to `go b eyond the evidenc e' they pre judge their own
conclusi ons, are self-lim iting and impov erish the world they study . And no amou nt of
such evidence ± of bricks new or old ± tells us anything about the meaning of the
edifice itse lf. Despite posi tivism's powe r as a heurist ic device ± as a me thod of
recovering facts about the past ± it of fers no guide to interp retatio n. A nd in carele ss
hands it can easily create monstrosit ies.
502 Andrew Stewart



For Br unn's ver y success immediately tempted lesser folk to add bricks of their own
± to multiply attributions, and thus inevitably to tur n his tightly-constr ucted edifice
into a ramshackle slum. Indeed, he even essays some of the more dubious tricks
practised by his followers: arguing from silence or in circles; special pleading; resur
recting famous names; making serial attributions (A B C D, but by now D has
little to do with A); using dated material to date unrelated `floating' work; and basing
historical judgements on personal views of ar tistic quality ± all are products of
positivism's hunger to create facts at any price, of its thirst for `positive' results, and
Br unn was by no means innocent of them.
Br unn's work was soon enriched in ways he could never have imagined. Rome and
its environs had been continuously excavated since the fifteenth centur y, and Pompeii
and Herculaneum since the eighteenth. Yet systematic digging in the Hellenistic east
began only in the mid nineteenth, inaugurating a process that still continues. Some of
the earliest excavations ± at Alexandria (1863), Delos (1873) and Pergamon (1878),
for example ± are still in progress. Others soon followed: in the Aegean area, at Pella,
Priene, Miletos, Magnesia, Rhodes, Lindos and Kos; to the west, at Taranto, Syracuse
and Morgantina; and to the east, at Antioch, Nemr ud Dag, Seleukeia-on-the-Tigris
and Taxila. Most have yielded much Hellenistic architecture and potter y, and some
(especially Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum, Pella, Pergamon, Delos and Alexandria)
have produced much Hellenistic sculpture, painting and/or mosaic. Supplementing
these finds, shipwrecks at Antikythera (1900), Mahdia (1907) and Cape Ar temision
(1926) produced precious `time-capsules' of Hellenistic bronzes and marbles. And
from the 1970s, new finds at Vergina in Macedonia (Andronikos 1984), at Ai
Khanoum in Afghanistan (Ber nard 1973±) and in the sea of f Alexandria (Empereur
1998) have transfor med our knowledge of the Hellenistic world.
Yet how was all this material ± already abund ant by 1900 ± to be organized? As
W inckelmann had discovered, classical Greek ar t of the fifth and four th centuries was
intractable enoug h. For Hellenistic ar t the problem is far worse, chiefly because of
Pliny's notorious `black hole' between 292 BC
and 156 (HN 34.52). He does include
the above-mentioned four bronzecasters who `did the battles of Attalus and Eumenes
against the Gauls' (HN 34.84) and seven more `inferior' ones assigned to the year
156 (HN 34.52) but notes only a handful of others. Two diligent Ger man scholars
(Overbeck 1868; LÈ owy 1885) had gathered all the available literar y and epigraphical
testimonia for Hellenistic ar t, but against the wealth of evidence for the classical
period it was modest indeed.
Moreover, the compilation of corpora of objects or types ± a favourite nineteenth
centur y activity ± was a par tial solution only. For among the dozens of `Neo-Attic'
reliefs, the hundreds of grotesques from all over the East and the several thousand
gravestones from Asia Minor, only a handful could be dated exter nally and many of
these looked disturbingly late ± i.e., Roman.
Like nature, scholarship abhors a vacuum . For tunately, two power ful new analytical
and documentar y tools ± for malism and photography ± together seemed to of fer a
remedy.
The for malists' agenda was simple. They wanted to bring order to the chaos of
Hellenistic ar t by discovering evolutionar y stylistic changes that had escaped earlier,
less sophisticated critics, and by creating chronologies out of them. Their databases
were the photographic arsenals now available in the published corpora and at the
Hellenistic Art, A D 1500±2000 503



German Archaeological Institute at Rome, and their mentors were master formalists
like Adolf Hildebrand (1847±1921), Alois Riegl (1858±1905) and Heinrich W È o lf flin
(1864±1945). Late in life WÈ olf flin even promoted an `ar t histor y without ar tists',
arguing that all significant stylistic change was supra-personal. For scholars of Hel
lenistic ar t, badly of f for personalities, dates and contexts, these ideas had immediate
appeal.
By 1910 one German scholar had already convinced many that on stylistic grounds
Br unn's Attalid monument should belong after the Great Altar rather than before it,
in the reign of Attalos II (159±138), and more
ad hoc
adjustments to the canon soon
followed. Others began with concepts impor ted from the more recent past, gathering
works that looked `Baroque', `Rococo' or `Neoclassic' in style and writing mono
graphs about them (e.g. Klein 1921). Some of these styles seemed at home in a single
centre, like the baroque in Pergamon and the `rococo' in Rhodes, others not.
Conversely, a city like Alexandria with a rich literar y and cultural tradition but a
spotty archaeological record attracted all sor ts of speculative attributions. These
ranged from new styles like pictorial and sculptural `Impressionism' to new genres
like landscape reliefs and grotesques (Schreiber 1885; 1889±94; etc.).
In Hellenistic sculpture, formalism's high priest was Gerhard Krahmer (1890±
1931), a brilliant connoisseur. His disser tation, grandly entitled `Stilphasen der
hellenistischen Plastik' (`Style-Phases of Hellenistic Sculpture') was published in
1924. It traced the ar t's supposed advance from the `closed' form of the first two
Hellenistic phases (the `simple' of
c
. 330±230 BC
and the `pompous' or `pathetic' of
c
. 230±150) to the `open' form of the late Hellenistic period (
c
. 150±100). Three
years later, his magisterial study of what he called `one-sided' groups argued that the
Laokoon and its ilk were designed to be seen solely from the front, like a relief. In a
classicizing retreat from the late, `open' phase (Krahmer 1927), they sought a
Hildebrandian ideal of well-bounded clarity and purity of form where despite an
often `baroque' content, contour again reigned supreme and all internal relations
were completely intelligible from the frontal plane.
Yet awkwardly this development apparently had begun as early as
c
. 150. For several
of Br unn's Attalid figures (figure 29.5) were suspiciously flat, but since Pausanias had
specified their dedicator as `Attalos' they could not post-date the reign of the last
Pergamene king, Attalos III, who died in 133 (Krahmer 1927: 71). So there they had
to stay.
Krahmer's disciples extended his ideas to other genres and even to architecture.
Mosaic and painting, rarer and more heterogeneous, remained on the sidelines, and
many areas of the field could take no real account of them at all. Architectural
historians continued to publish buildings and to research the development of build
ing types and their key elements. Numismatists continued to classify the extensive
coinages of the kings and cities. Ceramicists continued to sor t out the various relief
wares like `Megarian' bowls and plain fabrics like Athenian black ware and eastern
terra sigillata
; and so on.
Even in the field of sculpture non-Germans were quite resistant to Krahmer's
theories, with one notable exception. This was the American scholar Rhys Carpenter
(1889±1980), a brilliant teacher and power ful writer who in 1960 produced a late
and highly influential reworking of them in his book
Greek Sculpture: A Critical
Review
.

Like WÈ olf flin, Carpenter also wanted an `ar t without ar tists' but went fur ther,
characterizing Greek sculpture as the `anonymous product of an impersonal craft . . .
strictly conditioned by evolutionar y laws which are in turn dependent upon the
unchangeable dictates of the mechanism of human vision' (1960: v±viii). Accord
ingly, he put his Laokoon in the mid second centur y by rejecting Magi's flat, `one
sided' restoration (figure 29.2) for a more three-dimensional one that turned the
elder son at right angles to his father. Next he posited a `renascence of classic form'
after 150 that became a haven for many masterpieces expelled from the four th
centur y; and finally a wholesale `intr usion of plastic form' after 100, as stonecar vers
began to imitate the fluid, shifting epidermis of bronzes made from freely modelled
wax. Carpenter's follower Christine Havelock soon canonized these ideas in a well
illustrated college textbook on Hellenistic ar t (1970) which is still often read as
gospel by the unwar y.
Yet as Richard Wollheim (1980: 145) has explained in another context:
[The formalists] had far too narrow a conception of the range of devices operative in
ar t . . . Secondly, they had no theoretical means of fitting together stylistic changes on the
general or social level with changes of style on an individual or expressive level: W È o lf flin's
famous program of `ar t histor y without names' is in ef fect the denial that there is any
need to make the fit since all change occurs primarily or operatively on the more general
level. Thirdly, all these writers were confused about the status of their investigation.
From the fact that it is in the nature of ar t that it changes or has a histor y, they tried to
move to the conclusion that the par ticular histor y it has, the par ticular changes that it
undergoes, are grounded in the nature of ar t.
Krahmer and Carpenter themselves slide from a quasi-positivist reliance on induction
from close obser vation to an idealist imposition of an a priori system of organic
formal development (ultimately derived from Winckelmann) upon their material. So
although they use dated monuments wherever possible their reasoning is basically
circular and often relies on concepts alien to antiquity and problematic even on their
home tur f of the Renaissance and Baroque. The pattern is familiar. An originally
flexible heuristic device becomes a rigidly predictive one ± a way of creating ironclad
typologies ± and an all-too-recognizable spectre lurks behind the scenes. For the
entire scheme implicitly assumes some kind of universalZeitgeist at work. But why did
these alleged trends begin, develop and end as they did? Having ditched the ar tist as
both independent ar tificer and social being, they failed to produce a plausible group
psychology to take his place.
Worse, they overlooked a mass of evidence that Hellenistic styles are cumulative not
successive, often genre-specific and sometimes remarkably stable. They homogenized
works from dif ferent genres and even dif ferent continents into a single, monolithic
development. They relied excessively upon a few precariously dated sculptures (like
the Magnesia frieze, then dated c. 140 but now often to c. 200; or even the Laokoon).
They argued away or simply ignored anomalies like the Lesser Attalid Dedication
(figure 29.5). And they failed to see that their systems could never determine the
par ticular case. Why, for example, should an obser vation about a par ticular character
istic of some Hellenistic groups be generalized into a teleological account of the
development of all Hellenistic groups, let alone into a prediction about the dates of
other, as yet undiscovered Hellenistic groups?
Hellenistic Art, A D 1500±2000 505



So what Krahmer, Carpenter and their followers produced was a series of elegantly
argued theories of internal stylistic evolution. Yet unlike Pliny, Vasari and Winck
elmann they of fered no account of causes, motivations or goals, and were arbitrarily
restrictive in their selection of `significant' devices or traits for analysis. For example,
since sculptural groups necessarily involve interpersonal relations, why not select
increases (or decreases) in melodrama, pathos, violence, humour or eroticism, or at
least crosscheck these with one's supposed changes in style? If this suggestion seems
absurdly subjective, it is no more so than privileging a selection of traits based on
Hildebrand's transcultural theories about relief and plane, or W È o lf flin's pendulum of
`closed' to `open' form and back again.
After the Second World War the field turned to less grandiose concerns but only
rarely explicitly questioned either Krahmer's results or the formalist agenda per se.
(French str ucturalism and post-str ucturalism, so influential in the study of Attic vase
painting, for example, have barely touched it.) Yet some had already sidestepped the
formalist preoccupation with evolutionar y development. In 1940, for example,
Giovanni Becatti produced a lengthy study of Athenian Hellenistic sculpture, arguing
that the vast prestige of Pheidias and Praxiteles, reinforced by Athens' nostalgia for its
classical golden age, essentially conditioned the city's Hellenistic sculptors to produce
endless variations upon the classical style (Becatti 1940; cf. Stewar t 1979). Their
speciality was naturally the prestigious cult statue, until second to first centur y
Pergamenes and Romans began to demand reproductions of all sor ts. At Athens, in
other words, conser vative patronage and group psychology apparently coincided to
widespread profit and stylistic stagnation.
Today, most commentators would agree that Hellenistic styles in all media are
cumulative, not successive, and conditioned by a complex mixture of region, site,
patron, period, genre and function ± not necessarily in that order. Predictably, then,
site- and genre-based studies (and with them the atomization of the field) are
multiplying fast. At the turn of the millennium, in addition to ongoing publication
of excavations and individual objects in museums, one detects the following trends ±
many of which of course overlap:
.
Regional and site studies. Buildings or ar tefacts from a specific kingdom, region
or site (e.g., Mesopotamian or Egyptian temples; the rock tombs of Petra;
Macedonian paintings, mosaics and reliefware; Athenian fine and coarse potter y;
Delian sculpture and mosaics; Seleukid coins; etc.) are published for the first time
or studied afresh with a view to determining local preferences, developments and
responsiveness to external trends.
.
Genre and typological studies. Also essentially nineteenth-centur y corpora in up
dated form (e.g., of texts; architectural sculpture; r uler-and philosopher-por traits;
fishermen and peasants; erotic groups; decorative busts; engraved gems; metal
vessels; etc.), these seek to define styles and iconographies specific to the genre or
type in question, and often to investigate its social roots and sociopolitical signifi
cance. In extreme cases, they become essays in the social histor y of ar t.
.
Thematic studies. These include investigations of monuments that address a
specific agenda, whether ar tistic (e.g., realism; the grotesque; erotica; the nude),
political (royal patronage; theomorphic r uler por traits; por traits of careworn local
politicians; political allegories), cultic (cult statues; medical votives), social (`bour

geois' gravestones; luxur y and tr yphe), or literar y/rhetorical (theatricality; narra
tion; etc.).
. Studies of individual buildings, ar tefacts, ar tists, etc. Reconsidering key and often
problematic monuments and personalities (e.g., the Temple of Apollo at Didyma;
the Great Altar of Pergamon; the Alexander and Nile Mosaics; the Getty Bronze;
the Drunken Old Woman; the Farnese Bull; the Laokoon; Damophon of Mes
sene; the Tazza Farnese; Ptolemy II's Great Procession; etc.), these often propose
a radical re-dating or reinterpretation of their subjects.
. Exhibition catalogues. Exhibitions arranged around a historical personality, a
monument, a deposit, or a collection (e.g., Alexander or Kleopatra; the Telephos
frieze; the Mahdia wreck; the Walters collection of Hellenistic ar t) are increasingly
popular and promote republication and in-depth reconsideration of specific
objects and of the field in general.
. Symposia and anthologies. Assembling scholars of dif ferent backgrounds, discip
lines and/or nationalities, these usually attempt to shed light on a specific theme
(e.g., images, ideologies and self-definition; state and citizen; etc.), specific monu
ments (Pergamon/Sperlonga; palaces; sculptural groups; small bronzes; potter y),
regions and localities (western versus eastern Hellenism; Alexandria and Alexan
drianism; sculptural schools), or more rarely personalities (the architect Hermo
genes; the sculptor Phyromachos).
. Syntheses. These range from college-type textbooks covering all the major
ar ts (architecture, sculpture, painting, mosaic), through concept-based studies
(e.g., on ekphrasis and enargeia; the Hellenistic culture of viewing; the Hellenistic
body; etc.) and more traditional, parallel accounts of ar t and literature or art and
thought, to sur veys of individual media. Of the media, sculpture is easily the most
popular. Approaches range from far-reaching correlations with political events and
social trends to an almost total scepticism about dates, attributions and stylistic
continuity.
3 Directions
To express a preference for one approach or body of work over another is a good way
to make enemies and in the present climate of research doomed to rapid obsoles
cence. So the remainder of this chapter is intended to be illustrative, not prescriptive.
It summarizes three directions in my own work that in some ways typify current
scholarly trends: redating, reattribution and reinterpretation.
Hellenistic finds at Tel Dor, Israel: losses and gains
Dor is a crossroads (E. Stern 2000). Situated beside the coast road from Egypt to
Syria, blessed with splendid harbours to nor th and south, and of fering easy access to
the interior, the city was first settled in the Middle Bronze Age. In Hellenistic times it
withstood sieges by Antiochos III of Syria in 218±17 and by Antiochos VII Sidetes
and Simon Maccabee in 139±38. Around 100 it fell to the brutal Hasmonaean
(Maccabaean) King Alexander Jannaeus. In 63 Pompey the Great restored its auton
omy, and soon it became the southernmost por t of Provincia Syria. It continued
to flourish despite the foundation of Caesarea Maritima by Herod the Great (regn.,
Hellenistic Art, A D 1500±2000 507



37±4 B C ), shunned the Jewish revolt of A D 66±70, and prospered thereafter until for
some unknown reason it was abandoned around A D 235.
In the late nineteenth centur y the Turks stripped Dor of much of its stone, so that
when the British archaeologist John Garstang began excavations there in 1923 little
remained above ground (Garstang 1924). Yet the impressive ruins of a huge Ionic
building were still visible along the western, seaward side of the mound, and another
big foundation to the south of it. Both were built of massive blocks of the local
sandstone (figure 29.6). Garstang identified the nor thern building as an early Hel
lenistic temple, `poised on a high platform in the Syrian style, surrounded by a great
stone temenos wall which fronted to the sea' (1924: 97). Connecting it with
Poseidon or his supposed son Doros (the city's eponymous hero), he linked it with
a hexastyle temple with central arch and robed, sceptred figure inside, pictured on the
Roman coins of Dor. He said nothing about the southern foundation.
Malaria drove him of f in 1924, leaving Dor undisturbed for two generations. The
Hebrew University of Jerusalem reopened it in 1980; drawn by the prospect of an
incompletely excavated Hellenistic temple and by several anomalies in Garstang's
brief repor t, I was persuaded to join them with a U.C. Berkeley team in 1986.
Twelve excavation seasons later, we know that the huge nor thern building looked
nothing like Garstang's `temple . . . in the Syrian style'. Measuring around 70 35 m,
it was probably a huge pi-shaped stoa facing east, built over an underground corridor
or cr yptoporticus ± a Roman invention. The southern building is even more suspi
cious. 31 m (105 Roman feet) square, it looks like an Italic peripterus sine postico: a
cella surrounded by a colonnade on three sides, with a massive cross-wall substituting
for a Greek-style rear (western) porch or posticum (Vitr. De arch. 3. 2. 5 and 4. 7. 2,
reading alae instead of aliae). Concomitantly, these buildings' stratigraphy, the
ar tefacts from their foundation trenches, floors and approaches, and the occasional
remains of concrete show that they cannot predate A D 150. They may even be Severan
(suggestively, Garstang's coins date to A D 205/6 and 210/11). So was this huge
project the town's last gasp before its final demise in the 230s?
Yet once more losses on the swings are countered by significant gains on the
roundabouts. On the eastern and western sides of the mound the town plan looks
both characteristically Phoenician/Hellenistic and is essentially stable fromc. 500 B C
through to early Roman times. The rooms have yielded masses of stratified potter y
and other ar tefacts, including the best collection of Hellenistic relief ware (`Megarian
Bowls') in the Levant. Fur thermore, fragments of a limestone and sandstone Doric
building from its south side are stratigraphically pre-Roman and were found with late
second-centur y B C potter y and lamps. The columns' 1 : 7 lower diameter : height
ratio is distinctively Hellenistic, and a Nike akroterion was found with them (Stewar t
2001; Stewar t and Mar tin, forthcoming).
These finds, made in 2000, open up exciting new horizons. Was this perhaps a
temple built to celebrate Antiochos' defeat in 217 but destroyed by Alexander
Jannaeus around 100 ± his way of punishing pagan cities for resisting the resurgent
Jewish state? Yet the vandals apparently spared a superb mosaic inopus vermiculatum
vermiculatum later thrown into a nearby Roman pit (figure 29.7). Showing a theatre
mask of a young dandy wearing a fantastic basketlike hat, placed amidst exuberant
bouquets of fruits and flowers, it finds its closest parallels in second-centur y Pompeii,

A Greek tyrant, Zoilos, ruled Dor in 100. Perhaps the mosaic embellished his

All these discoveries are presently unique in Israel. The Doric `temple' andakroter
ion are the only cer tainly pre-Herodian examples of their kind, and the mosaic has no
equal there until the third centur y A D .
The Farnese Bull: Eumenes II of Pergamon or Mark Antony?
Among the monuments of antiquity, few remind us more forcibly than the Farnese
Bull (figure 29.8) that the past truly is a foreign countr y. Yet as its critical stock has
fallen ± from a `mar vellous mountain of marble' (Federico Zuccaro 1607) to a `drear y
mountain' of the same (Mar tin Rober tson 1975) ± scholarly investment in it has risen
propor tionately. For discoveries of other versions of it have prompted no fewer than
one exhibition catalogue, two monographs, a long encyclopaedia entr y and half a
dozen articles in the last ten years alone.
Found at Rome in the Baths of Caracalla in 1545, restored in 1579 and taken to
Naples in 1789, the group was soon connected with Pliny's repor t of a great
Hellenistic marble group in the collection (Monumenta) of Asinius Pollio (76 B C ±
A D 4): `Zethus and Amphion along with Dirce, the Bull, and the rope ± all car ved
from the same piece of stone ± a work by Apollonius and Tauriscus brought from
Rhodes. These men caused a controversy about their parents, professing that, al
though Menecrates appeared to be their father, their actual father was Ar temidorus'
(HN 36.33±4). The Naples version is now usually seen as a Severan copy, and its lost

original is ofte n placed at the beginning of the late Hell enistic period, around 160
BC
.
Cur rent opinion is that King Eum enes II of Pergamo n (regn. , 197±158 ) per haps
dedic ated this original at Rhodes ; Cas sius plundere d it in 42; Pollio acquir ed it by 39;
and its many rep licas begin with an is olated set of Etr uscan a sh-ur ns around 150 and
resum e when it reache d Rome (Kunze 1998). Since I disagr ee with most of this, here
is my own readin g of the evidenc e:
1 Pliny do es not say that the group was plundere d, merely that it was `brought'
from Rhode s. More over, other accounts of Cassius' extor tion s in 42 sugge st that h e
chiefl y wante d cash and valua bles. Pliny himself attest s that thousa nds of statues
Hellenistic Art, A D 1500±2000 511



remained on the island a centur y later, and Dio Chr ysostom (Or. 31. 147±9) denies
that any were plundered. But none of this matters if the group post-dates 42 . . .
2 Pliny's adoption tale, the signature of an [. . .]ates son of Menekrates (ethnic
unknown) on the Great Altar of Pergamon, and a late Roman schoolbook's garbled
mention of a `Menecrates' as one of the world's seven great architects cannot be safely
or even plausibly combined to yield a High Hellenistic date for the two sculptors.
Instead, a statue-base at Magnesia on the Maeander signed by an Apollonios son of
Tauriskos of Tralleis in a late Hellenistic or early imperial script suggests a triumviral
or Augustan date.
3 The simplest inference from Pliny's note is that Pollio himself brought the
group from Rhodes. Although he apparently built his museum in 39, he could have
acquired the Bull at any time. So the only safe terminus is his death in A D 4. Indeed, if
a late Hellenistic statue of a Roman general from Naxos carr ying a maenad in its
outstretched hand and bearing (inter alia) the Dirke scene on its breastplate is
correctly identified as Mark Antony, and if this relief indeed echoes Apollonios' and
Tauriskos' group (perhaps more accurately than the Farnese version), then this group
presumably was still on display at Rhodes in the 30s.
4 The Bull fits no Pergamene mytho-propagandistic scenario with precision, but
does fit both Mark Antony's devotion to Dionysos and his liberation of Rhodes from
Cassius and his allies in 42. In this case the avenging brothers would stand for Antony
himself and Octavian; Dirke would represent their defeated opponents, the `enslavers'
of Rhodes and the rest of Greece.
So did the Rhodians themselves commission both Bull and Naxian statue as
dedications to Dionysos, to thank the triumvir for their freedom and for restoring
Naxos and their other territories confiscated by Cassius? And after Actium, did
Antony's erstwhile suppor ter, Pollio (who had reconciled him and Octavian in 40)
then tactfully `depoliticize' the Bull by rescuing it for his own collection?
This scenario is supported by the following circumstantial evidence:
A The Farnese group's style is irrelevant. The original could have been made at any
time after c. 230; the Severan copyist clearly modernized the draper y, and ever y
head except the bull's is restored.
B The Hellenistic Etruscan urns that supposedly reproduce the group dif fer from it
both compositionally and iconographically. And after these urns and the Naxian
statue, the next echoes are from Augustan Rome.
C Rhodian Hellenistic marbles are generally small-scale votives or decorative pieces.
The closest Rhodian counterparts to Apollonios and Tauriskos are the car vers of
the Laokoon ± Hagesandros and family ± who on present evidence freelanced for
the late republican/early imperial elite. Perhaps they were Apollonios' and Taur
iskos' rivals. For they too car ved massive, complex marble groups, favoured
dramatic, `baroque' subjects, and produced an eclectic mixture of `original'
works and amplified versions of earlier ones.
D According to Pliny, Pollio's collection was heavily biased towards contemporar y
sculptors. Apollonios and Tauriskos fit comfor tably into this ambience, which
512 Andrew Stewart



complements Pollio's enthusiasm for and occasional patronage of contemporar y
Latin novi poetae such as Catullus, Gallus, the young Virgil and Horace.
There is a saying in American jurispr udence that circumstantial evidence is as good as
fact if there is enough of it. This speculative combination of the two, along with all its
ar tistic and political implications, may ser ve to indicate what is still possible in the field.
Laokoon: some final musings
If the discover y that Laokoon is blind holds water, it would prove that the group
cannot be based on Virgil. Yet the three Rhodians worked in Italy for Romans and
Virgil's account dominated the Roman imagination from the moment of its publica
tion in 19 BC
. So the group should either pre-date Virgil or (less likely) post-date him
and `improve' upon his account.
Whatever the tr uth, this discover y reinforces Laokoon's status as the ultimate
exemplum doloris. But it also prompts another question. Many of the great `baroque'
groups (the Pasquino ± now persuasively identified as Ajax heroically rescuing Achil
les' body after his ambush by Paris and Deiphobos; Achilles and Penthesileia;
Marsyas; Dirke; etc.) are based on epic/tragic themes. So what is there about the
baroque that lends itself to this par ticular heroic mode?
Of course, Hellenistic ar t's theatricality is a clichÂ e of the handbooks, and the
baroque is cer tainly the most theatrical of its styles. But the connection goes deeper.
Hellenistic culture was above all a rhetorical one where `the categories of eloquence
were imposed on ever y form of mental activity' (Marrou 1956: 195). So when a
grandiloquent, theatrical rhetoric devoted to psychagogia or the swaying of the soul
emerged in third-centur y BC
Asia Minor, it soon dominated not only public speaking
but also the production of literature, especially of epic, tragedy and historiography,
throughout the region and even elsewhere.
Wilamowitz first connected this flamboyant `Asian' rhetoric with the Pergamene
baroque in the year 1900. These `baroque' groups display many of the same charac
teristic traits as the example he chose, the Gigantomachy of the Great Altar (Stewar t
1993b: 133±7; figure 29.2). They share its love of auxesis (amplification), megalo
prepeia (grandeur), deinosis (intensity), ekplexis (shock), enargeia (vividness), antith
esis and pathos. But they do more. Whereas the Gigantomachy creates melodrama by
overliteralizing, they both move us to pity and fear, and explore the disastrous
outcome of a tragic error (hamar tia). All of this strongly recalls Aristotle's definition
of tragedy (Stewar t, for thcoming). So, paradoxically, could the Hellenistic baroque
represent the `classic' realization in stone of Greek culture's central literar y achieve
ment: Greek tragedy itself?
Envoi
On the Dor excavation we have a saying, facetiously called the Third Law of Archae
ology: `Only the future is immutable; the past is always changing'. Hellenistic ar t
remains our strongest witness.
