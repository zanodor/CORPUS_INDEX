Preface
Harmony and Symmetry: Celestial regularities shaping human culture
Culture is impossible without structure, and structure means regularity, the repetition of similar units of social behaviour. Astronomy as the oldest of natural sciences was always strongly connected with these regularities in human societies. Astronomical observations were important for temporal and spatial structuring daily life, providing orientation in a purely practical, but also in its spiritual meaning, thus connecting natural phenomena with astrological and religious interpretations of the world. The celestial sphere, regarded as the sky of astronomy and meteorology, as well as the heaven of divine numina, from the early times of Anaximander and Pythagoras till Copernicus and Kepler was equated with symmetry, harmony, and beauty. Till today this has been reflected in the structure of cultural creations, from architectural objects to musical forms. This broad conception of Astronomy in Culture will form the basis of the conference.
Graz, the capital of Styria and the second-largest city in Austria, is situated on the river Mur about 200 km southwest of Vienna, with a population of about 320.000 residents (in 2017). With 6 universities and 44.000 students Graz is a place of international encounter as well as intercultural and inter-religious dialogue. Karl-Franzens University is the oldest university in Graz, founded in 1585 by Archduke Karl II. Famous scientists were living and working in Graz, for example Johannes Kepler, Ludwig Boltzmann or Erwin Schrödinger.
The UNESCO honoured the city by including in the World Heritage List the historic centre (1.12.1999) and Eggenberg Palace (1.8.2010), because of its “diversified and highly comprehensive ensemble of architectural, decorative and landscape examples of the interchanges of influence from many neighbouring regions of Central and Mediterranean
Europe from the Middle Ages until the 18th century” (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/931/).

Eggenberg Palace is a beautiful example of harmonious architectural skill: The building, commissioned in 1625 by Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, was erected on a rectangular plain in a large garden. It represents a precisely calculated cosmos: 365 exterior windows, 24 state rooms with 52 doors, a Planet Hall with paintings created by Hans Adam Weissenkircher showing the seven celestial bodies or the twelve signs of the zodiac.
This remarkable city is going to host the 26th Annual Conference of SEAC The venue for this conference is the Meerscheinschlössl, a charming little baroque manor belonging to the University of Graz. A first building of 1580 was rebuilt in the 17th century and received its present form in1708. The festive hall displays a noteworthy fresco in
the ceiling. It is entitled “Victory of the Christian religion over the pagan deities” and this cultural object, featuring all the ancient planetary divinities gazing down on the conference, provides an impressive connection to astronomy.
The interdisciplinary character of this meeting will fit perfectly with the surroundings, embracing both science and culture. The more than 80 scientific presentations cover topics ranging from the Neolithic to modern times proved a fascinating cross section of the relationship of astronomy and culture. The texts collected in this volume were fully peer-reviewed to guarantee the scientific quality.
We wish the attendees a pleasant, fruitful, and interesting conference and a happy stay in Graz.

Where did astronomy ‘sit’ in ancient Greek and
Roman culture?
Liba Taub
University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK
Astronomy has sometimes been called the oldest science. Within ancient Greek culture, the earliest philosophers were credited with astronomical knowledge. Plato (Theaetetus 174 A) relates a story that Thales (flourished 586 BCE, and generally regarded as the first of the ancient Greek philosophers) was once walking at night and gazing upward, looking at the stars. Because he was not watching where he was going, he fell into a hole. However, Thales was also credited with a very useful astronomical skill, predicting a solar eclipse. In antiquity, he was credited by a number of later writers with having successfully predicted an eclipse of the sun which occurred on 28 May 585 BCE. The earliest extant account of the eclipse is from Herodotus: “On one occasion [the Medes and the Lydians] had an unexpected battle in the dark, an event which occurred after five years of indecisive warfare: the two armies had already engaged, and the fight was in progress, when day was suddenly turned into night. This change from daylight to darkness had been foretold to the Ionians by Thales of Miletus, who fixed the date for it within the limits of the year in which it did, in fact, take place” (Herodotus 1.74). The combatants saw the eclipse as disapproval of their warfare, and as a warning. They ceased fighting and a peace agreement was reached between the two kings. Historians and astronomers are not certain whether or how Thales accomplished this; often he is credited with having had access to some sort of Near-Eastern data and information about eclipses. Another story about Thales was shared by Aristotle, who reported (in the Politics 1.1) that he had cornered the market on olive presses and made a financial killing, through renting them out to others during a particularly good olive harvest, which he had predicted using his astronomical knowledge.



12
It makes sense to start an account of astronomy and culture with Thales because much of our understanding of the role of astronomy has come from—or been attributed to—philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle. Thales’ astronomical knowledge was seen as having practical benefits, whilst some of the earliest surviving explanations of astronomical phenomena as well as descriptions of the structure of the cosmos were offered by later Pre-Socratic philosophers. When considering astronomy in ancient Greece and Rome, there are some basic questions to be addressed: What is astronomy? What is it for? How does it relate to other types of knowledge? How does it relate to other parts of culture?
Whilst the earliest philosophers are credited with astronomical work and discoveries, astronomy was often regarded in antiquity (and later) as a branch of mathematics, along with arithmetic, geometry and harmonics. This immediately raises questions about the relationship between philosophy and astronomy. Accordingly, the connections between astronomy (accounting for the motions of the heavenly bodies using geometrical models) and cosmology (natural philosophical explanation of the motion of such bodies) will be addressed. In addition to theoretical astronomy, the practical uses of the study of the heavens for time-finding, calendar production, weather prognostication (useful for navigation, agriculture, medicine and commerce) and astrological prediction (particularly important in ancient Rome) will be considered, with reference to archaeological as well as textual evidence. Finally, one of the ‘uses’ of astronomy was as an aid or path to personal improvement, advocated, for example, by Plato as well as the Alexandrian astronomer Claudius Ptolemy. The ethical value of pursuing astronomy can be understood as a practical benefit.

Planetary Astrology in Early China and the
Sāsānian Connection
David W Pankenier
Lehigh University (emeritus), Bethlehem, PA, USA
In the “Treatise on the Celestial Offices” Tianguanshu (ca. 100 BCE) in Sima Qian’s, Grand Scribe’s Records, Shiji, Sima Qian attempts a theoretical reformulation of the conceptual basis of astral omenology. Sima Qian advances the earliest account of astrological history; that is, the idea that from a comprehensive study of past “intersections” between astral and terrestrial realms it is possible to derive a theory of celestial interventionism. Here I focus on a motif of that theory, the role of periodic planetary clusters in astral omenology between Sima Qian’s own time and the Tang Dynasty (618-907), illustrating how such omens played a seminal role in dynastic politics. Finally, the

Schloss Eggenberg - A Symbolic World
Barbara Kaiser
Universalmuseum Joanneum, Graz, Austria
Right up to today, Schloss Eggenberg has been the visible symbol for the unprecedented rise of a family. For a brief period, this was where regional and world history were joined as one. The palace owes its name to its famous owner: Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg (1568-1634), who rose from being the son of a provincial patrician to becoming one of the most powerful statesmen of his times at the beginning of the 17th century. As the closest confidant of Emperor Ferdinand II., he steered the political fortunes of the Empire at the start of the Thirty Years War until, in 1625, he was appointed Governor of Inner Austria, which he ruled as the representative of the Emperor.
In return, and starting from 1625, he had a palace built on the western edge of Graz as a complex synthesis of the arts. It was intended to offer legitimacy – of the kind that would be visible far and wide – for this unprecedented rise. Hans Ulrich chose to base the design of his house on the most important European residences of the time. In this regard, he also wanted to set new standards in the Habsburg Hereditary Lands. Here, architecture and the interiors combined to offer a symbolic representation of the universe in a “world edifice” worthy of a scholarly statesman. The structure is constructed as a gigantic simile, a symbolic effigy of the universe in which the learned owner formulates his idea of an orderly world in an epoch of chaos and disintegration.
Right down to the smallest detail, the architecture follows a sophisticated programme: built as an image of the universe, it is characterised by ideas of cosmic harmony which had been advanced by natural philosophy. In it, the course of time and celestial mechanics, earthly hierarchy, world



16
history as well as the sphere of beliefs and values all have their place, as do their equivalents such as alchemical and astrological notions of the structure of the universe.
As a stunning entrance hall to the princely apartments the magnificent Planetary Room (1678-1685) constitutes the centrepiece of this artistic programme. Paintings of the planets and the zodiac, some constellations and the elements were forged into a complex visual programme by the court painter Hans Adam Weissenkircher with the aim of glorifying the House of Eggenberg. Portrayed here as gods, members of the dynasty rule over heaven and earth in a self-created universe. With its sophisticated artistic programme, the Planetary Room is one of the most impressive examples of early Baroque spatial art in Central Europe.

Astronomy and Indigenous Technologies in Africa
Paul Baki
Department of Physics and Space Science & Technical University of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya
The use of astronomy in shaping the indigenous technological advances amongst select African ethnic groups is discussed with a view to unravelling the hidden science behind it. We give a survey of various material forms of material culture and how they were used together with sky knowledge for a variety of indigenous knowledge systems.

Celestial regularity as a basis of time-reckoning
Hermann Hunger
Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien, Austria
In Mesopotamia time was measured with the help of celestial regularities. The course of the sun separated day from night. The appearance of the moon combined a number of days to a month. The return of the seasons led to the concept of the year. Starting from these units, a calendar was developed which had to overcome the incommensurability of its building blocks. The paper will describe both the practical side of the calendar and the theoretical schemes intended to explain its foundation.

Planetary Harmonies & Celestial Symmetries
George Latura
Independent researcher, Trumbull, USA
Comparative analysis of relevant ancient texts yields the long-held correspondence between celestial Wanderers and musical tones. Another result is a cosmic construct that consists of two intersecting circles whose diametrically opposite intersections would be seen as heavenly portals. Can a coherent cosmological view be postulated that encompasses the music of the Planets and the symmetry of the heavenly intersections?
In the Vision of Er, Plato describes Sirens that sit atop Planetary orbits and produce a harmony (Republic, 617b). Aristotle, a scholar at Plato’s Academy, notes that the harmony of the moving celestial bodies is a Pythagorean concept (On the Heavens, II, IX). Cicero, who emulated Plato’s writings, connected music to the heavens in his Dream of Scipio, a notion that Macrobius would explicate in his Commentary on the Dream of Scipio, a text that was still studied in the 15th century (Figure 1, Somnium Scipionis). Even in the 1600’s, Kepler’s Harmonices Mundi sought to explain the Planetary orbits in musical terms.
In his cosmological tour-de-force, Plato again writes about the Planets when the Demiurge constructs the cosmos from two intersecting celestial circles (Timaeus, 36c). One of the intersecting circles is – according to Plato – the path of the planets, the ecliptic. This makes the course of the harmonic Wanderers one of the circles that intersect at opposite locations in the sky. What might be the other celestial circle?
In De Re Publica’s Dream of Scipio, which emulates the Vision of Er in Plato’s Republic, Cicero describes two celestial paths: the course of the Planets and the Milky Way. Cicero’s protagonist, Scipio, meets his virtuous ancestors in the Milky Way, the abode of exalted souls. In his Commentary on Scipio’s Dream, Macrobius places the heavenly



22
portals at the intersections of the Milky Way and the zodiac, the constellations along the path of the celestial Wanderers.
Writing shortly after Cicero, Manilius gives the correct and precise locations of the intersections of the Milky Way and the Planetary paths, and he declares that the course of the Wanderers is a visible celestial phenomenon (Astronomica I, 681). Manilius must be writing about the zodiacal light, which at times envelops planets along the ecliptic. This ethereal sight is best seen, in temperate climes, at symmetrically opposite seasons of the year, at the equinoxes (Kelley, Milone, Exploring Ancient Skies: An Encyclopedic Survey of Archaeoastronomy. Springer, 2005, p. 138).
The visible intersections of the Milky Way and the zodiacal light, which are best seen at the symmetrically opposite equinoxes, suggest the use of this phenomenon in cultic practice. Aligning with this hypothesis, the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of Eleusis were celebrated near Athens at opposite times of the year, in spring and fall (Latura, ‘Plato’s X & Hekate’s Crossroads: Astronomical Links to the Mysteries of Eleusis,’ Proceedings of SEAC XXI Conference, in Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry, 2014, Vol. 14, Issue 3, p. 37-44).
To conclude, celestial harmonies were linked in antiquity to the Planets, while heavenly symmetries are seen in Plato’s two cosmic circles that intersect at opposite locations in the sky. One circle is the path of the Planets, while the other circle was considered the Milky Way for a thousand years in Latin Europe. In temperate latitudes, the course of the Wanderers is illuminated by the zodiacal light at the equinoxes, which provides ancient cosmology with another instance of heavenly symmetry.

Constructed Knowledge? – New insights on visual characteristics of Middle Neolithic Roundels
Gordon Fischer, Gerd Graßhoff, Christina Michel, Wolfram Schier
Excellence Cluster TOPOI, Berlin, Germany
Circular enclosures, so-called ‘Kreisgrabenanlagen’ or ‘roundels’ are a much-discussed archaeological phenomenon of the early 5th millennium BC, occurring between western Hungary and central Germany. Their consistent appearance is characterized by circularity, concentric v-shaped ditches up to 4 m depth with one or more narrow entrances or causeways and accompanying palisades around a noticeably empty interior. Although these monuments seem to comply with a common set of architectural rules, they can be characterized by a great variability of their formal variants and construction details which do not seem to follow regional patterns, contradicting current models of spatial differentiation of material culture and hindering their overall interpretation. As many of the entrances of the enclosures –often differing in design – seem to be oriented towards astronomical phenomena, most frequently to the cardinal points of the sun during solstices and / or equinoxes (BECKER 1996, ZOTTI 2008, SCHLOSSER 2007 etc.), they have been interpreted as solar observatories, calendar buildings, cult or meeting places. However, more recent studies incorporating the real topographical location as well as the effective visible horizon challenge this perception (ZOTTI und NEUBAUER 2011, MICHEL in prep.). Since some enclosures are, in fact, orientated not only towards astronomical phenomena, but also towards topographic landmarks, it appears that the location of the roundels was not chosen randomly, but intentionally (SCHIER und SCHMIDT-KALER 2008, MICHEL et al. 2015). Currently, they are interpreted as multifunctional constructions that were predominately used for cultic-religious purposes but also served socio-political tasks (STÄUBLE 2012).



25
Given the short life span of the transcultural “Kreisgraben-phenomenon”, which emerged within a mere 200 years between western Hungary and central Germany, the dynamics of dissemination of the required geometrical-geodetic and astronomical knowledge are yet unknown. Furthermore, their occurrence raises even more questions as they are not distributed evenly at regular intervals but appear to be clustered in certain areas, opposing possible interpretations as central places.
Within a newly implemented project, funded by the Excellence Cluster TOPOI, we intend to expand our previous research that dealt with the spatial and visual characteristics of 29 (MICHEL et al. 2015, MICHEL in prep.) roundels in Germany. Based on high-resolution digital elevation models, areas possibly orientated towards topographical and astronomical features were systematically investigated using GIS-based viewsheds and computed skyscapes and a self-developed Python based routine that incorporates the visible horizon as seen from the enclosure.
On the basis of random samples from the entire distribution area of the roundels, we want to examine whether similar topographical and astronomical orientation of the gates can also be verified in other regions. Then, a limited number of criteria (e.g. design and orientation of the gates, size, number of ditches etc.) will be selected to assess the structural variability of the enclosures. By means of suitable multivariate methods like cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and network analysis, these criteria will be used to calculate the degree of generalized similarity between all samples comparing them with their respective geographical distances. The evaluation of these two variables, spatial distance and formal similarity, as well as their cartographic implementation by means of GIS, might be helpful to weigh between different conceivable models for the transfer of knowledge and the spread of this architectural concept.



26
Therefore, by comparing physical structures, GIS-based viewsheds and computed skyscapes of several roundels throughout central Europe, we attempt to understand the route of knowledge transfer as well as depict possible cultural interactions and communication networks.

In a large area of Central Europe comprising a region going as far as the border of Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria and Hungary a class of archaeological structures called Kreisgrabenanlage (KGA, Neolithic circular ditch system) has been discovered and investigated1. Some are situated in the Transdanubia region part of the western Pannonian plain and exhibit as some researchers have suggested astronomical features.2
In our study we focus on two archaeological sites situated in the southeast of the Pannonia region (250 km southeast from Transdanubia), near the Vršac insular group of mountains in Serbia.
The Vršac Circles (Vatin - Bela Bara, Sector 6, Location VIII3, 45°12'37" N, 21°17'14" E, 73m altitude), is located about 1 km inside the northeast part of a marsh (Veliki Rit, about 250 km2 large). Due to poor soil quality and the presence of near surface water even in hot summer periods the area seems unsuited for permanent settlement or to act as a defensive function. The archaeological site consists of four concentric earthworks with a maximum diameter of 150 m occupying
1 The current archaeological interpretation is that they were used as a multi-purpose cult place... They are the oldest known monumental buildings in Europe (4850/4800–4550/4500 B.C.). Zotti, Neubauer, 2011, p. 349. 2 Pásztor, Barna, 2015, p. 2.

about 1.8 ha.4 The oddity of the placement and the fact that the Vršac Mountains (Gudurica Peak, 641 m altitude) are the only significant landscape feature in the region made us consider a possible archaeoastronomical relation between the two. By using Skychart5 and Stellarium6 we identified an alignment between Vršac Circles and Gudurica Peak (12 km to the southeast) at the WSSR in Neolithic. We have performed a photographic and video survey on December 25, 2017 (5' azimuth difference from actual solstice) at the sunrise moment from the Vršac Circles. The azimuth difference between the two periods is about 1° (about 2 solar diameters) to the south (winter) and to the north (summer) for the Neolithic period.
In the second case we have done a reverse engineering starting from the two highest peaks of Vršac Mountains and attempted to find if there are any Neolithic sites aligned with the SSSR. By using satellite images, we have found a circular shape and from an in situ superficial surface field research we discovered a Neolithic site that we call Vlajkovac Predial (45° 3'32" N, 21°11'44" E, 2.3 ha). From SkyChart and Stellarium we found an alignment between Vršac Circles - Vršac Peak (590 m altitude about 16 km to northeast) at the SSSR in Neolithic. We performed a photographic and video survey on June 21, 2017 at the sunrise moment from the Vlajkovac Predial.
4 Prospecting at this location was unsystematically done by sampling. In the eastern part of the central circular formation, with diameter of about 45 m, four pieces of house paneling were found, which indicates to the possible existence of above-ground facilities. Jovanović et alii, 2012, p. 53.

Even if the two sites are not from the Neolithic Lengyel cultural area and are far from the core of the Kreisgrabenanlage world and not yet archaeologically investigated, in our opinion, the vicinity (60 km north) of the Parța Vinča sanctuary7 in Romania which also exhibits equinoctial alignments, could be one of the arguments to support the hypothesis that Vršac Circles and Vlajkovac Predial could have played a role in the rituals celebrating the Sun in Neolithic. Of course, future archaeological research will confirm or infirm this hypothesis.

Common features of megalithic stone rows in western Switzerland
Rita Gautschy
University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland
Three megalithic long stone rows are well known in western Switzerland: one in Yverdon le Bains (Clendy), one in Lutry (La Possession), and another in Sion (Chemin de Collines). While the site in Yverdon was discovered already in the 1870s during water regulation works, the other two came to light rather recently and excavation as well as reposition of the stones was done properly. Each monument is special in another sense: in Yverdon we can be relatively sure that all stones of the final stage of the monument are still there since it was covered by water for millennia. In Lutry we possess excellent data concerning stratigraphy and dating of the monument (Burri-Wyser et al. 2016). Finally, the stone row in Sion can be investigated in connection with its neighbouring chambered tombs and settlement (Moinat et al. 2007).
I investigated the topographical situation of the above stone rows in detail and measured their orientation. The corresponding data from the settlements and tombs were taken from the literature (BurryWyser et al. 2016; Moinat et al. 2007). The most obvious similarity between the stone rows is their connection with water – two of them were very close to the boarder of a lake, the one in Sion lies close to the river Rhône. One of the two alignments in Yverdon follows the ancient boarder of lake Neuchâtel and points toward one of the mountain peaks, the Dent du Vaulion. With high probability the orientation of this alignment was motivated by topographical reasons, not astronomical ones. In Lutry the exact course of the ancient boarder line of Lake Geneva is less well known than in Yverdon, but the overall appearance of the monument suggests that the water should be blocked and kept outside.



32
Analysis of the orientation shows that the stone rows in western Switzerland were preferentially erected close to lakes and rivers in places where non-restrictive solar irradiation was guaranteed, a feature they share with palafitte settlements in the vicinity. The general orientation of nearby settlements corresponds to the orientation of the stone rows. The stone row in Sion dates to the 5th millennium BCE. The monument in Yverdon can be allocated only roughly between 4500 and 2500 BCE and several building phases are assumed. The stone row in Lutry was erected between 2570 and 2350 BCE and it was in use until at least the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 1500 BCE). The site was abandoned ca. 1200 BCE when forest vegetation increased considerably. Thus, the monuments were built by different cultural groups and under different environmental circumstances. The combination of all available data (tombs, settlements, stone rows, orientations, climate data, lake level data) allows for a tentative scenario of the evolution of society from the Middle Neolithic down to the Bell Beaker Culture in western Switzerland.

Megalithic Total Solar Eclipses
Göran Henriksson
Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden
The first calculations of total solar eclipses during the Megalithic period were published in 1989. The computer program was based on the lunar theory by Carl Schoch (1931). The zone of totality of the solar eclipse in 3337 BC followed the Atlantic coast from the west coast of Portugal via Carnac in France, across central Denmark and southern Sweden and covered the main distribution area of megalithic passage graves. There was another total solar eclipse, in 3328 BC, that included the main area of other passage graves. The total zone of the solar eclipse in 3299 BC covered an area including central Denmark, three southern provinces of Sweden and the Swedish islands Öland and Gotland in the Baltic. Almost all Swedish passage graves had been within the total zones of solar eclipse 3337-3299 BC, in good agreement with the archaeological dating.
In 2011 I decided to eliminate the artificial third order term in Schoch’s theory and to determine a new second order term that represented the true secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude. The new second order term, -30.128 ±0.0035 arcseconds/(century)2, was determined from calculations of 33 total or almost total solar eclipses back to 3653 BC (Henriksson 2017). After subtraction of the relativistic effect precession of the geodesic, -3.604 "/cy2 (Nordtvedt 1995), and the acceleration in the Earth-Moon inertial system, -25.856 ±0.003 "/cy2, measured by LLR (Chapront 2002), from my new determination of the second order term in longitude, it was even possible to determine the mass of the graviton according to a theory of massive gravity (Dvali et al. 2003). The oldest total solar eclipse used in the calibration was depicted on a protoliterate Sumerian cylinder seal. With the new calibration three other Sumerian cylinder seals have been identified (Henriksson 2017). It has also been possible to



34
identify seven megalithic depictions of total solar eclipses in Ireland, France, Spain and Sweden, not included in this calibration.
A very critical solar eclipse took place in 3146 BC and has been depicted on kerbstone K16 at Knowth as the upper half of a series of concentric circles, the symbol for total solar eclipses on Ireland. This eclipse took place during the setting of the sun and the lower limb was never eclipsed above the horizon, but it became as dark as during a totality and the observers could correctly depict Venus to the left of the sun. This rare event makes it possible to independently verify the values for the secular lunar and solar accelerations (ΔT). The total solar eclipse in 3328 BC has been depicted in the gigantic dolmen in Dombate in Galicia, Spain and in the passage grave Mane Lud at Carnac, France. The very important total solar eclipse in 3389 BC has been depicted on “The Great fallen Menhir” also at Carnac. Finally, in southern Sweden there exist depictions of the thin crescent of the upper limb of the eclipsed solar disk at three places close to the northern limit for the zone of totality in 3299 BC.

The Lunar meaning of Avebury and Stonehenge
Nicholas Kollerstrom
Astro Industries, London, UK
Britain’s largest megalithic construction, Avebury, has I wish to argue certain lunar features, notably the two wheels inside it close to each other and of similar size, of a hundred metres across. There is agreement that the southern of these wheels had 29 stones, from as far back as John Aubrey’s account, but less agreement that the northern wheel had 27 stones, which is I suggest the most likely estimate. I argue that these represent the two fundamental lunar months, sidereal 27 days and synodic 29 days.
There is a link between Stonehenge and Avebury, 18 miles apart and which are exactly due North-South of each other (within one or two degrees) because the arithmetic sum of these two wheels gives the number of Aubrey holes around the perimeter of Stonehenge, 56, there being agreement that this was the first step in the construction of Stonehenge, around five thousand years ago. Avebury was, I argue, the first to be constructed.
The ring of 29 1⁄2 sarsen stones (one being only half-size) expressed the synodic lunar month of 29.5 days, this being the first recorded expression of a fraction in human history: numbers which express a beginning of human arithmetic.
In the last phase of Stonehenge at the end of the megalithic era (c. 1400 BC) the so-called ‘X’ and ‘Y’ holes appeared around the Sarsens, these being two rings of 29 and 20 holes, elliptical in design. These were an early expression I will argue of a lunar-month calendar alternating 29 and 30 days.
I will call for chalk in-fillings of the 56 Aubrey holes, to make them visible to tourists; plus, some other marking of stones, of the Y and Y holes, so that tourists can see for themselves the lunar meaning of this



36
monument –which academics always disdain to mention. Also, one or two of the giant stones of the northern wheel inside Avebury could and should be resurrected, which would help to make that ancient wheel more visible.
Stonehenge is sublime because it integrates solar and lunar meanings – however this talk will not discuss its great solar focus upon the midwinter sunset and midsummer sunrise, which is in any case wellknown: except to mention that, according to English Heritage dating, those great trilithons thus solar-oriented are later than the big ring of 29 1⁄2 stones which are lunar. I will comment upon the station-stone rectangle which is one of the earliest features of Stonehenge and well described in John North’s book (1997) 'Stonehenge' (image included); this rectangle being aligned to the most northerly Sun and Moon rise and set directions. Only at this specific latitude do these directions form a rectangle, any other would have given a parallelogram.
I will argue for some degree of continuity of purpose whereby solar and lunar meanings have intertwined in these two megalithic monuments over about one and a half millennia. The primary reason for concern with the lunar month in that early period, would have been the synchrony that women of childbearing age had in their periods, the mean female period of that age range being 29-30 days. This was well argued in Chris Knight’s well-respected anthropological treatise 'Blood Relations' of 1991 (NB, I am there acknowledged in the preface for astronomical advice): there may not be time to discuss this, but it might arise in Q&A. About the author: I was on the RAS (Royal Astronomical Society)

The historical significance of the orientations of the chamber-tombs of Bronze Age Crete near Mavro Spelio (Black Cave)
Mary Blomberg and Göran Henriksson
Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden
One of the most important problems of the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean is the nature of the relationship between the Minoans and the Mycenaeans. According to the study of Driessen and Macdonald (1997) there was a severe economic dislocation during the Late Minoan IB ceramic period in Crete (= Late Bronze Age I in the Aegean), apparently caused first by a tectonic earthquake and shortly afterward by the eruption in Santorini in Late Minoan IA. The result of these two disasters caused the fragmentation of Minoan Crete and brought an end to the most highly developed economic system in the Aegean. It was somewhat resurrected in the following “Mycenaean” period (LMII). There is some consensus that the Mycenaeans in LMII were part of the cause ending the Minoan control of Crete. But there is still fierce debate on this question. Only Dickinson (1994, 304) and Marinatos (1993, 221) have suggested that there were Mycenaeans or Mycenaeanised Minoans (second-generation Cretan Mainlanders) living in Crete as a contributing cause.
Our study of orientations of the chamber-tombs of the two cultures may shed some light on this problem (Blomberg & Henriksson 2001). In 1926/1927, E. J. Forsdyke published the remarkable chamber- and shaft-tombs found in Crete on the upper slopes north of the dry gorge that cuts down from the Black Cave to the Kairatos River. He dated them 1700 -1100 BCE (Middle Bronze Age II-Late Bronze Age III in the Aegean) and, from the series of typical potsherds found in them, could show that they were in continuous use during those 600 years. Fifteen of the total of 22 graves have dia-dromoi (entrance passages), the orientations of which we could measinure on the published



39
drawing in the article with a margin of error estimated to be less than ± 5°. These all had orientations to the west. The orientations that we have measured of 299 of the 323 other chamber-tombs with diadromoi on Crete, which date from about 2500 to 1100 BCE, were all aligned to the east, closely within the limits of moonrise. The graves at Mavro Spelio have never been considered other than as Minoan.
As part of our archaeoastronomical project to investigate Minoan astronomy, (http://minoanastronomy.mikrob.com) we measured a large number of the cult rooms on the island. These in almost every case were oriented to sunrise at the equinoxes, the standstills, or the heliacal rise of a prominent star. There were a few exceptions that had orientations to the west (Blomberg & Henriksson 2001). These few are probably to be dated to LMII or later and contained Mycenaean objects. We consider that these western-oriented cult rooms were built by or for the Mycenaeans. This has caused us to entertain the possibility that the graves from Mavro Spelio could have belonged to a large and prosperous Mycenaean colony, well entrenched since the Middle Bronze Age in Crete. This is a new possibility to explain the later takeover of the island by the Mycenaeans and could explain it as a palace revolution of competing elites, one with roots in the Mycenaean colony, but with intermarriages with the Minoans (Minoanised Mycenaeans).
We have now investigated the finds from the graves at Mavro Spelio and found conformation that they came from Mycenaean graves.

Games for Cosmos: How the Minoan elite ruled their people by mastering ritual performance and the cycles of time
Marianna P. Ridderstad
University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland
Games and gaming in ancient cultures often had also ritual, as well as profane, purposes and connotations (Rappenglück 2018). Examination of Minoan games, game boars and artistic representations of games show that this was likely the case also in the Minoan culture. While many small game boards were probably used in a profane context, especially the largest and most elaborate palatial game boards may have been used in rituals as well.
The Minoan palaces, villas and sanctuaries were oriented towards important annual astronomical events (Henriksson & Blomberg 2011, and references therein). Moreover, depictions of the sun, the moon, and stars were frequent in Minoan art (Ridderstad 2009). Even seemingly profane objects like the Minoan kernoi or game boards include celestial symbolism (Hillbom 2005; Ridderstad 2010). Especially the largest game boards and those that have been found in a palatial context can be connected to astronomical symbolism.
In the palaces, the astronomically-themed game boards became to be used in a sacred landscape including the palaces and their surrounding astronomical setting, which formed a concrete visual expression of Minoan cosmovision and acted as the background for individual religious experiences, probably including divination via gaming. On the other hand, this connection of the games to the rituals and prestige of the palaces also explains why the celestial and calendrical themes were preferred in the Minoan game boards in general.
The relation of Minoan game boards to astronomy, religion and ritual thus provides a setting where the celestial symbolism of the game



42
boards becomes understandable as a concrete manifestation of the Minoan cosmovision. Examination of this connection provides insight into the Minoan ritual life, led by the religious elite, who were able to use their calendrical knowledge and the cosmological connections of the games in their quest for power.

A Journey to the Late Bronze Age Minoan Underworld: The Reflection of Sunlight on the Sea as an Axis Mundi
Ilaria Cristofaro
Sophia Centre for the Study of Cosmology in Culture, Lampeter, UK
Around the times of sunrise and sunset, the sun’s reflection on a large body of water, such as a sea, appears as an elongated gold band, also called a ‘glitter path’. For the first time, this research explores this intangible manifestation of light from an archaeological perspective, focusing on the Late Bronze Age culture present on the Greek island of Crete. The analysis of secondary literature highlighted the potentiality that exploring this topic may have to enhance the comprehension of Minoan cosmology. Indeed, a significant role of the sun in Minoan religion was argued by Arthur Evans, whereas the importance of the sea as a chthonic realm is attested by the presence of marine elements in funerary context, with the octopus the most frequent motif. In particular, Lucy Goodison and Nanno Marinatos suggested that the deceased was believed to follow the sun during the journey across the sea-underworld. The observations gathered during the phenomenological fieldwork, carried in Crete for three months, revealed that the elongated sunlight reflection on sea has the qualities of a natural manifestation of the cosmological concept of the axis mundi, echoing the liminal convergence of opposing realities. By comparing Late Minoan III funerary iconography with the fieldwork results, this study developed an interpretation of the Minoan eschatological beliefs creating analogies between the cultural and the natural world. In particular, the hybrid form of the octopus-plant motif was analysed: the discussion focused on the octopus role as tree of life, on the axial syntaxes of the decoration, on the transformation of the octopus in a rosette with tentacles, and on the liminal character of the motif. The multivocality of the psychopomp octopus symbol may reveal, in its



44
transformation into a flower and a water pillar, an affinity of shapes and qualities with the glitter path. A polarity of forces appeared manifested in the metamorphosis of the octopus, which seems to embody a complementarity of opposite meanings, at the same moment representing death and renewal. A solar eschatology can be deduced in a Minoan world where life and death seem to procreate each other: the vision of the glitter path across the chthonic sea might have been regarded as the luminous roadway toward afterlife regeneration. The vision of a solar axis mundi on sea might have acquired a cult role related to the sun worship, which explain the interchangeability of the sun with trees and pillars in Minoan-Egyptian religious syncretism, as discussed by Evans. Franz Cumont’ ‘solar attraction theory’, based upon the beliefs that sunlight could transport the souls to the afterlife, is argued to be applicable to Minoan eschatology, and vice versa, the finding of the glitter path as an axis mundi may give hints to unveil the origins of Cumont’s theory. Indeed, there are reasons to believe that the idea of the glitter path as an axis mundi may be applied in future research in other cultural contexts where mythologies tell about a tree of life made of gold to access other states of existence. Similarly, cults employing an iconography of sacred pillars surmounted by a winged disk, obelisks, and solar columns, might have been fostered by the vision of the glitter path. The sea-, land- and skyscapes are reflected in the material culture: a narrative of the Late Bronze Age Cretans’ cosmology was inspired by participating within the local natural world.

Exceptional evidence of a prehistoric meteorite impact at the archaeological site of Stöttham (Chiemgau, SE-Germany)
Barbara Rappenglück & Kord Ernstson
INFIS, Gilching, Germany & Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Germany
Archaeological excavations at the village of Stöttham (SE-Germany, close to the eastern shore of the lake Chiemsee) in 2007/2008 had revealed settlement indications from the Neolithic up to the Roman period. The origin of a thick stony layer being part of the archaeological stratigraphy was highly disputed: one group of researchers described it at a normal colluvium (1), while other scientists argued that the layer testifies to a prehistoric meteorite impact (2) which has otherwise been documented in the region and is named the Chiemgau Impact (3). Meanwhile the site has been overbuilt, but the archaeological findings are well-preserved.
Within the last 10 years the knowledge of materials which can be encountered in the region and which can be attributed to the mentioned meteorite impact has remarkably been broadened (4-6). This new information triggered first-time more detailed examinations of some findings from the Stöttham site, which before had been put aside as objects of minor interest: pieces of slag coexisting with rock. The microscopic analysis of thin sections of the samples revealed typical shock metamorphism in quartz (e.g. planar deformations structures), which is classified as proof of a meteorite impact (7), and a complex caking of the rock with the metallic residues (copper, iron).
The presentation will discuss the archaeological and geological context of these findings and the significance of the results for (a) confirming that the Stöttham site had been affected by a meteorite impact event; (b) for the dating of the Chiemgau Impact.

A Statistical and Information-Theoretical Analysis of the Motifs on Bronze Age Golden Hats
Marc Thuillard

Several artefacts from the Bronze Age have been interpreted as ceremonial hats. The most famous of these artefacts are the so-called Golden Hats exhibited in Berlin and the Avanton Golden Hat at the ‘Musée d’ Archéologie Nationale’ in St-Germain-en-Laye, both dated from the late Bronze Age (Menghin 2010). Two other hats are known: the Schifferstadt and the Ezelsdorf-Buch Golden Hats. The surface of the hats is decorated with motifs arranged in horizontal bands. In several articles and a monograph, Menghin developed the idea that the motifs are coding for a calendar related to the Metonic cycle. In order to synchronize a lunar calendar of 12 synodic months to the solar year, one extra month has to be added every 2 to 3 years. Menghin suggested a scheme on how to use the Golden Hats to correct for the difference between the average length of a lunar (synodic) month and a solar month using the Metonic cycle. This scheme was rebuked (Fuls, 2007) due to a lack of statistical support. In other words, Menghin’s interpretation is one among many equally probable explanations of the motifs. Menghin’s second suggestion, namely that the motifs on the Golden Hats code for numbers related to the Metonic cycle has neither been challenged nor statistically tested yet. This article deals therefore with the following question. Is the interpretation of the markings as coding for numbers related to lunar and solar cycles a statistically acceptable hypothesis? Our approach combines a statistical to an information theoretical approach. Simply expressed, all processing rules up to a given complexity are tested and included in the statistics. After attributing a value to each motif, one may consider applying simple processing rules to the different motifs. The simplest non-trivial processing rule consists of summing the motifs‘



49
values on each zone (processing rule R0). More complex rules may be thought of. In order to avoid the significance chasing pitfall, the processing rules are classified according to their complexity. The first difficulty with that approach is that our modern ideas about complexity were unknown in Bronze Age. Complexity theory may nevertheless be used to find out what might be perceived as simple today and possibly also during Bronze Age. Another difficulty is that there is no single definition of complexity. Kolmogorov’s complexity or time complexity do not apply well to inter-disciplinary studies. A different measure of the complexity is used in this study. The complexity of a processing rule is defined as the sum of the number of independent parameters (Kline, 1991; Wells, 2012) and of the number of different operators.
The addition is the simplest operation among the 4 basic operations on integers. Using a single addition operator, one has the processing rule R1: ∑ xi
in=1 with xithe value of the ith zone and ‘n’ the number of zones (The output corresponds to the sum of all values).
A slightly more complex processing rule consists of using the addition operator together with one independent parameter ‘k’.
R2a: ∑ x(i);
ik=1 R2b: ∑ x(i)
in=(k+1) (The two outputs correspond to the
sum on two subsets of adjacent zones). For symmetry reasons, the two rules are equivalent and cannot be considered separately.
Two parameters are used at the next complexity level.
R3:. ∑ x(i)
ik=2k1 (The output corresponds to the sum of the values be
tween the k1th and the k2th zone)
Using these processing rules, one obtains numbers that can be compared to the list L of integer multiples of synodic months and solar months (up to 35 years) of equal duration with an error below ±1.6 days.



50
Using a randomization procedure on the number, value and order of the motifs, a probability P of obtaining at least as many matches in the randomized version as in the Golden Hats was estimated with a Monte-Carlo approach. The statistical analysis of the motifs on the Golden Hats shows a clear over-representation of number in the list L. The small probability P for the 3 largest hats (P= 0.105 % ± 0.003 %) supports the hypothesis that the motifs on all but the Schifferstadt Golden Hat code for numbers related to the synchronization of lunar and solar cycles.

Was the knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth in roman imperial period reserved to the elite or was it common knowledge?
Sara Wanek
University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria
Ancient astronomers were aware of the spherical shape of the Earth. Amongst others this can be seen in the written records by Claudius Ptolemy dating back in the 2nd century, broadly known as the Almagest. This contribution will examine, if it was an exclusive knowledge, reserved only to the scientific elite, or if it was known by the many.
There are no written sources about the general knowledge of the roman civilization. Furthermore, an educational ideal cannot be assumed for the broad public in the Roman Empire. That is why the material culture has to be consulted for approaching this problem. For the evaluation of the ancient finds iconographical interpretations and proper analogies are used.
To carry out the examination suitable and representative archaeological objects have to be selected. Because of their large dissemination within the whole empire, sundials provide significant evidence for the transfer of knowledge. This is particularly the case for the cognition of the lines of latitude, which are fundamental for designing a correct transportable or fixed sundial. It is a fact that suggests, that the Earth was not thought to be flat, but round. Besides the representations of celestial spheres seem to allow the presumption of the knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth. Speaking of celestial spheres, there are two distinctive examples that have to be mentioned. A detailed marble one is carried by the Atlas Farnese, the other one is the celestial sphere of Mainz (Germany). Nevertheless, these two objects have to be related to the upper class



53
and are not representative for the general public. A similar situation can be found in Boscoreale, where a sphere with lines – probably a globe – was used as a wall painting. Additionally, the iconography of the sphere expands into the imperial representation. A silver cup, again found in Boscoreale, shows Augustus accompanied by Vicotria with a sphere in his hand. This is the symbol and iconography for universal control over space and time. These images start to appear on coinage as well. Often Victoria is shown on a globe, which is mostly a simple sphere or a sphere with crossed lines. Images on coins were intended for the whole empire and designed for all people. They worked as propaganda for the emperor and for this reason the iconography hand to be understood by everyone. Only images that could have been easily and universally recognized have been used for coins.
The appearances of globes and celestial spheres, mostly shown as simple spheres or with crossed lines, in imperial representation and propaganda for the emperor, seem to significantly support the assumption, that the spherical shape of the Earth was know by the vast public at least in roman imperial time. The widespread usage of the iconography on different finds meant for a large public requires that the image of the round Earth was easily understood by everyone.

Which rule for the order of days in the week in artefacts from Roman times to 1600
Nicoletta Lanciano
Dipartimento di matematica "G.Castelnuovo", Università "La Sapienza", Roma, Italia
I show some artefacts in a critical way, from the Roman period up to 1600, where there are 7 planetary Gods of Mediterranean culture (the Moon and the Sun, with Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) related to the days of the week, and the enigmatic question of their order. What Mesopotamian peoples and Jewish knew of the 7 planets when the time unit of the week was established?
What rule does the planets order so that the day of the Sun is followed by the day of the Moon and then by that of Mars and then of Mercury, of Jupiter, of Venus and then of Saturn? This order is not directly related with the duration of their period of revolution among the fixed stars, it is not an order of brightness or supposed distance. To find out, we must instead suppose a 24-hour day that is repeated cyclically in a day after another, in which each hour is dedicated to one of the seven planetary bodies and in which every day takes its name from the planetary body of his first hour. In this way, thanks to the relation 24: 7 = 3 with the remainder of 3, we obtain, from 24 hours marked on a circle, and the order of the planets from the slowest to the fastest, a 7-pointed star with a harmonious and cyclic spatial arrangement.
The artefacts studied are calendars painted or engraved on marble tables from Roman times (Rome, Anzio, Pompeii - It), mosaics on the ground (Italica- Seville-E), bas-reliefs and then Planetary tables published in medieval texts and two artifacts of 1600, as complementary astronomical apparatus in monumental catoptric sundials in Rome.



55
The type of hours is analysed from time to time, if they are equal or temporary, if they are Italian, Babylonian or French, used in the various artefacts and in the various tables presented.
Moreover, in the different languages the names of the 7 planets assume different names that hide or reveal their mythical origin and the relationship with the names of the planets. In the Italian language, for example, the days from Lunedi to Venerdi (Monday to Friday) refer to the gods of Greek-Latin mythology, Sabato (Saturday) is linked to Jewish culture and Domenica (Sunday) to Christian religious culture.
The scan of the time unit between the day and the month is also presented, similar but not equal for duration to the week of 7 days, which preceded it in the Roman world: nundinae.
The iconic artifacts and representations studied have been the starting point for didactic laboratory actions, both for the construction of original dynamic models and for bodily and rhythmic actions.

The Horologion of Andronikos Kyrrhestes (Athens, Greece): Investigation of its eight plane sundials
Panou, E.1, Liritzis, I.1 and Preka-Papadema, P.2

The Horologion of Andronikos Kyrrhestes (official name of the monument), is a structure about 14 m tall and 8 m in diameter. It is an octagonal building, which incorporates a cylindrical structure on the south side. At the top of the eight vertical walls is a vaulted ceiling depicting the sky. Engraved lines on the exterior of the eight sides of the edifice show that there once existed this number of sundials.
The Horologion is an astronomical and cultural monument of great importance. According to recent research, it was built around 100 B.C. (Kienast, 2013; Panou, 2016). The plan view of the octagonal base of the building demonstrates the astronomical use of the monument.
On the floor there are curved grooves, straight channels and circular holes indicating the former existence of a hydraulic mechanism. In the upper part of its exterior surface is a frieze with eight personified wind deities, one on each of the sides (Noble & Price, 1968).
The Andronikos’ sundial in the centre of Athens, at the footstep of Acropolis, also called the Tower of the Winds, is a unique cultural monument of astronomical significance standing as such for over 2000 years.
In our presentation in situ measurements and proper mathematical relationships are used to confirm a) the position of the eight (8) gnomons (rods or styles) of presumed shape, and, b) the casted shadow onto the flat plate of these sundials.



57
Indeed, as the sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different hour-lines and curves, which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day and the season throughout the year. The style is the timetelling edge of the eight gnomons of the monument. The gnomons cast a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, wire, or elaborately decorated metal casting. The style is parallel to the axis of the earth’s rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude of its position in Athens (Latitude 37° 58′ 27′′ N, longitude 23° 43′ 37′′ E).
Recently, the Tower of the Winds or Horologion of Andronikos has been included in the Category of Astronomical Heritage: tangible immovable web portal for UNESCO’s Astronomy and World Heritage Initiative, supported by the International Working Group on Astronomy and World Heritage and by the International Astronomical Union through its Commission C4 on World Heritage and Astronomy (Liritzis & Panou, 2017-18)

Introducing skyscapeR, an open-source R package for data reduction, visualization and analysis in cultural astronomy
Fabio Silva, A. César González-García, Victor Reijs, Fernando Pimenta and Andrew Smith
University of Wales Trinity Saint David, UK
This talk will introduce skyscapeR, an open source R package for data reduction, visualization and analysis in skyscape archaeology, archaeoastronomy and cultural astronomy, which is being developed by the authors. The package aims to be a transparent and peer-reviewed set of robust quantitative methods, while retaining simplicity of use and free access.
In its present, nascent, state it includes functions to transform from horizontal to equatorial coordinates, automatically reduce compass and theodolite (sun-sight) field measurements, create or download horizon profiles and plot them, overlay visible paths of common celestial objects over horizon profiles, create azimuth polar plots, create declination curvigrams, run significance tests on curvigrams and calculate stellar phases and seasonality. However, the goal is for it to be further extended as a community-effort.
The package has been developed in the R language for statistical computing (R Core Team 2017), which is a freely available programming language of wide currency in the fields of statistics and data science, as well as in the digital humanities and social sciences, including archaeology. The current version of the package is available freely (Silva, 2017) at https://github.com/f-silva-archaeo/skyscapeR and via the official Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/skyscapeR
The purpose of this package is not to be just another tool in our field, but to spearhead the development of a community-built standard for



59
quantitative analysis of fieldwork data. It is therefore intended to be fully open, implementing methods that have been fully peer-reviewed, and include both simple-to-use functions with standardized parameter values – ready to be used in undergraduate courses, for example – as well as more advanced features that allow top-quality research to be produced. This talk will present and introduce the package to attendees, as well as open up to debate future directions and possible collaborations with other SEAC members.

A Virtual Park of Astronomical Instruments
Georg Zotti
Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, Vienna, Austria
Historical written sources and illustrations have preserved valuable information about astronomical instrumentation going back to Antiquity. Ptolemy has described a few instruments like the armillary sphere or the parallactic rule, and from the early Islam science several treatises on instrumentation which extend Ptolemy’s, but also introduced new instruments are known. Most of these instruments are no longer in use, and practically all original instruments have been lost. Others, like mural quadrants, still can be seen in historical observatories. Many of the existing texts are flawed with copying errors or lack details in describing their construction and use. How can we best replay and see how they were operated, short of building a physical instrument?
A game engine like Unity3D [Unity 2018] is usable for creating computer games and other interactive virtual worlds. We can create virtual 3D models of past astronomical instruments and interact with them using common PC interfaces like keyboard and mouse. However, the sky in game engines usually lacks astronomical data [Zotti 2014].
In the last years the open-source desktop planetarium Stellarium [Stellarium 2018] has gained capabilities for rendering 3D models of buildings in their landscapes complete with shadows to study the orientation of human-made constructions with alleged astronomical connections [Zotti 2016a, 2016b]. However, the models are not interactive.
Recent extensions to Stellarium [Zotti et al., 2017] opened the way towards interfacing both programs (at least on Windows), so that the



61
sky background for Unity can be delivered by Stellarium. This allows replaying measurements with old instruments recorded in historical sources in a high-quality game engine with all its possibilities for interaction or enhancing the scenes with animation, informative text or sound, visualized with the high quality sky simulation of Stellarium.
There are two ways of interfacing Unity3D with a running instance of Stellarium: in both, Stellarium is controlled by its remote control interface to set date, time, geographic location, or activate various visualisations (grids, constellation figures ...). One mode allows to create “skybox textures”, 6 screenshots which cover the entire sky and are used as static background. This mode is perfect for creating concrete “snapshots” of the sky. However, its Spout output [Spout 2018] even allows rendering the sky background into the live scene with only minimal delay, which means the natural appearance of the moving sky can be combined with the moving virtual instruments, and any relevant astronomical data can be delivered by Stellarium. Both modes require a reasonably modern PC. On the other hand, it should be possible to modify the skybox variant to load one of several precreated skybox sets for presenting this interactive scene online in a web browser with Unity’s WebGL capabilities.
As a proof of concept, I have assembled several models published previously into a Unity application which resembles a park landscape with several visitor stations:



62
• The “Vienna Sterngarten”, a modern public sky observing place in Vienna. The model is available in Stellarium’s Scenery3D plugin. It does not contain moving parts, but Unity can be used to describe and highlight parts as the virtual user is walking around. • Several instruments from a treatise by al-Wābkanawī on the instruments of the second phase at Marāgha (around 1300AD) [Mozaffari and Zotti 2012]. Some of these show a striking similarity to instruments later used by Georg von Peuerbach or Tycho Brahe. • (More instruments may follow by the time of presentation). The visitor can walk around in this landscape like in any modern firstperson adventure game. When close to an instrument, a short text gives relevant information about it and also gives instructions for interaction. The user can click on the movable parts of the instruments to move them. A special switch allows attaching the observer’s eye to the alhidade in each instrument to “look through” and into the sky which is delivered by Stellarium. To switch features in Stellarium (e.g. time speed, grids, constellations), some of its usual hotkeys have also been implemented in the Unity scene, which calls Stellarium via its remote



63
control interface. Depending on the instrument’s capabilities, the measurement results (usually altitude and if available, also azimuth angles) are also displayed on screen. From this the visitor can learn what these instruments could achieve, and how to do that.
Of course, interaction with mouse and keyboard is somewhat short of a true hands-on experience, but can still give an approximate insight and good illustration of how early astronomers gained their observational data. As a valuable side effect for historians of science, the construction of virtual instruments also can help to identify problematic texts which may have been garbled by copying errors [Mozaffari and Zotti 2012].

“Th’inconstant Moon”: lunar celestial mechanics
as a template for ritual transformations.
Lionel Sims
University of East London, London, UK
Recently three different researchers in cultural astronomy have independently suggested that Neolithic/EBA monument building cultures in the British Isles were wedded to a dualistic lunar-solar cosmology (Fisher 2018 in press, Higginbottom 2013, Sims & Fisher 2018 in press). All three models posit ritual alternation between reversed horizons and reversed lunar standstill/solstice alignments. It has been earlier suggested that such systems emerged as a socio-political reversal of synodic lunar phased rituals in early hunting bride-service societies to sidereal and solstice phased rituals in pastoral bride-price societies (Model 1; see Sims 2006). This model posits that whereas early upper Palaeolithic rituals were optimally timed to coincide with monthly lunar phases, by the Neolithic these have been displaced, reversed and confiscated to the 9/10 yearly alternation of the lunar standstills at the solstices. This model contrasts with the standard model which suggests a slow accumulation of astronomical discoveries with the changing technological capabilities from foraging to agriculture (Model 2; see Parker Pearson 2012). If Model 1 is valid, then we would expect supporting and overlapping evidence to be found in other case studies and in other knowledge sets relevant to the period and cultures. If Model 2 is valid, then we would expect an early engagement with solar time reckoning.
From the point of view of cultural astronomy, we would expect a pool of scholarship consistent with the suggested Model 1 for a long run undermining of early Palaeolithic/Mesolithic synodic lunar phased ritual systems. Such evidence exists for lunar phased rituals in the Palaeolithic (Marshack 1972, Rappenglück 2015) and for intermediate solarised/synodic lunar systems in the Magdalenian (Sims &



65
Otero 2016) to the emergence of the sidereal reversed Moons of solarised lunar standstills by at least the Neolithic (widely attested in the archaeoastronomy literature). This is consistent with the findings of the recent three independently claimed dual cosmologies in the British Isles Neolithic and supportive of Model 1 but not Model 2.
From the point of view of inter-disciplinary method, we would expect other cognate disciplines to converge and triangulate around a similar set of assumptions and findings for Model 1. Witzel (2012), using the historical comparative method in mythology, has reconstructed an initial sub-Saharan African transformational mythological template originating about 100 thousand years ago from which he suggests all the world’s myths emanate. While this claim is consistent with the assumptions of Model 1 he also suggests that the earliest ‘astronomical’ components of these foundational myths were rooted in solstice rituals – a claim closer to Model 2 than Model 1. While Model 2 assumes beginning with simplicity in ‘astronomical’ lore and moving to a later complexity of scientific knowledge, Model 1 assumes beginning with complexity and moving to a confiscating simplification and substitution of lunar properties. Model 1 therefore expects cryptic and coded lunar motifs inserted within apparently solar myths as part of the confiscating agenda for a solarising dynamic in ritual transformations. Alternatively, Model 2 expects the gradual accumulation of a store of astronomical knowledge.
As part of a wider project to evaluate these alternative models, this paper investigates whether the myth of Core/Persephone shares any isomorphic properties with the celestial mechanics of the Sun and the Moon.

Lunar Standstills or Lunastices: a lunatic myth or a moonly reality?
A. César González-García1, Juan Antonio Belmonte2
1. Instituto de Ciencias del Patrimonio, Incipit-CSIC, Santiago de Compostela 2. Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias & Universidad de Laguna, Tenerife, Spain
There has been a lot of fuss in recent times regarding the importance of lunar standstills (see e.g. the entry on Lunar Alignments at the Handb. Archaeoastr. Ethnoastr., González-García 2015, or the recent JSA Forum on Lunar Standstills on this matter; Sims 2016), or even on their existence and importance in prehistory or Antiquity (Schaeffer 2017).
Any lunar alignment is difficult to prove even if in several cases the moon seems the best explanation to the data (da Silva 2004, González-García et al. 2007, Pimenta et al. 2009, Silva & Pimenta 2012). In particular, it is true that the lunastice or the lunar standstill is an elusive and difficult to understand concept, and it is possible that different researchers are using these concepts to mean various things, which makes difficult a common agreement on the significance or not of these terms.In particular, in the SEAC XXV Conference in Santiago, Bradley Schaeffer (2017) advocated for the disappearance of this terminology as he vindicated that there are no significant alignments that may prove the intentionality of such phenomena, also that they had ‘zero utility’ (sic) as they do not serve to pinpoint any particular moment in a calendar and finally that there is no indication in the ancient literature of the awareness of people in Antiquity regarding the extreme positions of the moon.
In the present talk, we want to address these caveats. First, we propose a new definition of standstill or lunastice to try avoiding confusion with the terminology. Second, we would like to highlight some individual cases of sites where orientations towards standstills are indubitably important given the lunar nature of the deities worshiped



68
there, like the ziggurat of Ur (related to the lunar god Nanna; Iraq) and the temple at Sheikh Ibada (devoted to the moon god Thoth; Egypt) Third, in those cases where other data is not available (like the ethno-historic sources indicating the lunar character of the divinities mentioned above) the statistical argument seems relevant, in particular in the case of the Recumbent Stone Circles in Scotland (Ruggles 1999) or certain Mayan cities in the Yucatan (Šprajc 2016), but we would like to add a new study case in the Supe Valley (Peru). Finally, we would like to present an updated review on relevant ancient scripts where there might be indications on the awareness of the extreme positions of the moon, contrary to what Schaeffer has recently claimed.

A Catchy World Model: The Concept(s) of Cosmic Mountain(s) Used by Ancient Cultures
Michael A. Rappenglück
Adult Education Center and Observatory Gilching, Germany
Since prehistory symbols, myths, rituals, tangible structures like certain natural mountains and mountainous ridges or artificial earthen mounds, (stepped) pyramids, cultic buildings, city plans, and symbolic objects had been dedicated to the idea of the world mountain. Some people had developed very detailed concepts, including a complex of interrelated cosmological, cosmogonic, psychological, sociological, and religious motives.
Often genesis started with the primordial mound emerging or being brought up by creator animals from the chaotic waters and shaping an island. Being a point of origin, the primordial mound occasionally was associated to the world’s navel, to the mons pubis, or to the phallus. Very important was the World Mountain’s 3D- shape and internal structure, which allowed the visualization of an elaborated cosmology. The model of the cosmic mountain denotes centricity, verticality (axiality), the maximum height and depth, cardinality, and different strata of the world’s framework. The sides (or corners) and levels of the mountain are assigned to directions, the four source and streams, winds, mythical continents and seas, colors, sounds, certain objects, animals, plants, social classes, tutelary spirits, and divinities. Sun, Moon, planets, stars, and the Milky Way are encircling the mountain. The pole star and / or circumpolar asterisms are positioned above. The sun is thought to nest as a solar bird on the summit or moving there as a sun wheel. The openings (gates) in the mountain, through which Sun, Moon, and stars rise, set or pass, are considered by some cultures. The areas spotlighted by Sun and Moon were important, too. Special groups of minor mountains, aligned to a central major one, were important in myths and for time-reckoning as well as



70
orientation: twin mountains, two mountains of sunrise and sunset, four mountains, a mountain range, and a ring of mountains. Mountains were used as a kind of a gigantic sun dial. The summit is considered to be the place of immortality and transcendence. There and at the mountainsides the immortality herb grows. The World Mountain is the source of heavenly life-giving essence, flowing through it and vivifying the numerous beings existing at the mountainsides and in the interior cavities. Some people located the World Cave within or beneath the world-mountain. Both embody a place beyond normal space-time, the origin of life and renewal. The cave as the mountain’s ‘heart’ was considered to contain prototypal entities, treasures (minerals, medical herbs, etc.), the heavenly bodies of the otherworld, and timeless knowledge. The World Mountain model connects cosmological with transcendental ideas, illustrated by the topics of the glass (ice, crystal) mountain as well as in burial mounds and temples. The mountaintop and the cave within the mountain are associated to a human’s body and a final spiritual state. On the summit the ruler’s palace and throne are placed. Sacred mountains, often a symbol of the cosmic mountain, had been and still are today centers of pilgrimage,



71
circumambulations, rituals, oracles, and power visions. The study discusses varieties and similarities of the topic with respect to geographical locations, periods, cultural properties, and astronomical aspects. The methodology is interdisciplinary, using comparative mythology, ritual studies, archaeological records, geological and geographical facts, and socio-anthropological considerations.

Empowering Sky Imagery
Daniel Brown,
Nottingham Trent University, School of Science and Technology, UK
Images of the sky at night have been a source of inspiration. To understand this inspiration the concept of skyscapes has become more important (Silva 2015). A Skyscape is a general manifestation of astronomy that can in one interpretation be explored as sky framed by land that is full of meaning and includes a deep personal attachment. As such, exploration (as carried out by D Brown with A Souto, D Brown 2016a, Mukundu 2016) of the sublime as well as art theoretical analysis of the dialectic of Site versus Non-Site (as carried out by D Brown and D Harty, Brown 2016b) offers a strong incentive to not only develop powerful public engagement images but also inform researchers in the field of skyscape archaeology. Therefore, these images convey a powerful message of awe and wonder and anchor the celestial within an accessible, terrestrial context. They are a rich source of inspiration for artists and scientists alike, and can also convey educational messages in the context of light pollution. Ultimately, they establish a contemporary case study of western culture communicating with skyscape thereby offering a vital route to interpreting skyscapes in any epoch and by any culture or people.
This presentation will be analysing the already existing, rich image database of the Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year (IAPY) award, which is run annually by Royal Museums Greenwich, focussing on the 2015 and 2016 rounds. This competition is open to all and allows photographers from around the world to submit their astronomy pictures under certain category. In recent years the category ‘sky and people’ has seen an additional category added: ‘skyscapes’. Not only has the competition gained enormous popularity it has also demonstrated how (in this case mostly) western culture has rediscovered humans in their sky imagery. Especially the use of skyscape



73
as a category is hinting on a rich source to explore skyscape experiences captured in imagery. We present research carried out using these images as primary sources to investigate the question: "How can imagery of skyscapes inspire to create awe and wonder?" In a first instance imagery was analysed to establish initial definitions of skyscapes and develop a semi structured questionnaire. Visitors to the IAPY exhibition in Greenwich were then interviewed and our team also documented their own impressions and experiences of the exhibition space. We also gathered comments from the awarding panel on their criteria for selection and establishing new categories. The results include word clouds and associations that indicate that not the actual content of the image is defining of a skyscape but rather its ability to offer awe, wonder, inspiration and exploration. Our results also indicate that humans are a defining component in what makes a skyscape. Especially one response by a participant summarises our initial finding and is presented in Figure 1) offering possible further avenues of work to come.
The project outcome will not only allow to use skyscape imagery to communicate the powerful night sky heritage, it will also offer an exploration on how our contemporary western culture engages with skyscape. Even though it is clear that what generates awe and wonder when watching the sky will depend upon the time, place and people, however the way in which it is created will remain similar given that humans present with identical phenomenological interfaces to their environment now and in the past. Here we hope to point out key parameters under which we can reliably discuss versions of prehistoric skyscape experiences.

Weaving as cosmic instrument: a sublimation of the vertical and the horizontal
Feeney-Beaton Morag Helen
University of Wales Trinity Saint David, and the Royal Opera House London, UK
The action of weaving, and the tools necessary for the process to take place, have in the worldview of many cultures been assigned a cosmological significance often associated with the natural order of the cosmos. Its prominent position within world mythologies is testament to its symbolic weight, whereby weaving acts as an agent of creation, crucial to the maintenance and preservation of the universe, undertaken by a pantheon of weaving goddesses from diverse societies. With these cosmological credentials, weaving can be defined by the mythologies that it has given rise to.
Yet the key to unlocking the cosmological status of weaving can be sought not so much through its mythological underpinning but within the making process itself. At the core of weaving’s functional technology is the criss-crossing of the warp and weft threads, dependent as they are on tension and counter-tension; this readily gives rise to an essential binary symbolism, a fundamental oppositional polarity naturally epitomizing contrasting dynamics and forces. The weaving process is built around a quintessential duality, one originating from the intersection of the warp, (representing verticality, the unchanging, the present, the now), and the weft, (indicative of horizontality, the passing of time, the ongoing),8 a duality which resonates with the Platonic notion of being and becoming set out in the Timaeus.9 Through the process of interlacing and intertwining, weaving has the

76
capacity to reconcile such polarities and to bind strongly opposing factors together, forming an integrated textile out of conflicting entities; in a similar way, in musical notation, the strands of horizontal counterpoint are transformed and qualified by harmonic verticality. Perhaps the act of synthesis that weaving undertakes accounts for its fundamental symbolic significance within many cultures, permitting weaving itself to be justifiably considered, as argued by John Scheid and Jesper Svenbro, ‘the union of opposites’.10
Accordingly, the intrinsic symmetry and internal cohesive balance that weaving and the woven textile possess allow for the cosmological aspects surrounding the craft to be more easily perceived. This paper will hope to discuss areas where weaving has a symbolic affinity with both the wider cosmos and with human life, the macro and the micro. As an act of creation, the activity of weaving could be said to symbolically emulate the original act of creation. Indeed, Mircea Eliade’s theory of a repeated ritual cosmogony11 is pertinent here to a craft that is founded upon repetition and upon rhythmic cycles, thereby prompting parallels with not only an ordered and regular universe, but also an understanding of the cyclical nature of life. Each repeated woven operation can be regarded as a form of re-enactment, a narrative that resonates with David Abram’s notion of cyclical time and his observation wherein ‘what happened once happens again and again’.12 As a counterpart to this close association of textiles with

cosmology, it is possible to construe a symbolic relationship of weaving with humanity, the so-called thread of life, there being, according to Christopher Tilley, a direct analogy between the logic of creation and the logic of procreation.13 This paper will investigate how, through this metaphorical symbiosis of life and cosmos, of the personal and the universal, the craft of weaving is able to facilitate the process of re-order and resolution by achieving a reconciliation of the vertical with the horizontal.

The “ Intihuatana” of Saywite ( Perù): an
archaeoastronomical investigation on the role of time marker of the gnomon

In this paper we show the new results of the archaeoastronomical analysis of the center of religious worship Inca Saywite, an archaeological site located in the Abancay Province, in the Apurímac Region of Peru; it is some 100 km west of Cusco. Saywite is regarded as a center of “sacred space” focusing on the cult of water . There are several architectural remains: terraces, warehouses, fountains ,channels, carved stones, a double-jamb doorway, and a platform “ ushnu” from where it is possible to see the gnomon.. The complex is divided into some sectors, but it seems to be organized into two main districts: the upper ,where a large platform contains the Saywite monolith, and the lower that includes carved stones, among which there is the so called “Intihuatana”, that is suggested to have astronomical purposes.
The best evidence for Inca astronomical practice involves a system of pillars, mountains, caves, springs which were worshipped and most of them were connected with the annual cycle of celebration that tracked the turnings of the sun. Solstices, equinoxes and Zenith were astronomically significant times and linked to seasons. The timing of this type of celebration were determined to account for terrestrial conditions and were linked with very important planting and harvest festivals.



79
In a previous work we have analyzed this Inca site, taking in account the ritual, central Inca calendar used for the administration of the Inca Empire.
The focus of this new work is the study of how the “Intihuatana” of Saywite worked as time and season marker.
The new data have been collected in situ, in summer 2017, by the authors. The magnetic measurements have been corrected by the magnetic declination. Moreover an aerial survey was carried out using a drone . The 3D model has been created with the photogrammetry of the drone Phantom Pro4 and the data have been processed with the software Pix4D. We have analyzed all the records , obtaining notable results. Subsequently an appropriate statistical study was carried out in order to check their astronomical consistency.
The statistical analysis was performed using the most recent techniques belonging to the theory of the Circular Data that is one of the most suitable way in the archaeoastronomical data processing. Statistical test have been applied to verify the confidence level of the results obtained. The archaeoastronomical analysis of the “Intihuatana” was carried out with special care trying to find the real symbolic meaning and using of the carved stone, taking in account the Inca Sacred symbolism.
Here we summarize the results of our recently accomplished systematic study and we would suggest that there could be a



80
correlation between the position of the Sun in the Sky and the shadow projected by the corners of the steps of “Intihuatana” on the ground.

Llactapata and the Puzzle of the Two Coricanchas
J. McKim Malville and Gary Ziegler
University of Colorado, Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences, Boulder, USA
First located in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, Llactapata, lying some 2 miles southwest of Machu Picchu, eluded rediscovery until 2003. Bingham had rapidly sketched the major structure of the site which showed several rooms with a double jamb doorway, characteristic of the entry into a royal or sacred structure. Beginning with our rediscovery in May 2003, the complexity and size of the Llactapa Archaeological Zone has grown to include more than 130 structures on some 3 km along the Llactapata ridge. The central part of the zone contains a water temple, an ushnu, and structures surrounding the doublejamb doorway that are remarkably similar to the Coricancha of Cusco in size and orientation. The corridors behind the double-jamb doorways of the Coricancha and Llactapata include sightlines to the June solstice sunrise and the rising of the Pleiades.
“The most important and most stumptuous temple of this kingdom was
the one located in the city of Cuzco; this temple was held to be the chief
center or capital of their false relgion and the most venerated sanctuary
that these Indian had. This temple was called Coricancha which means
“house of gold,” because of the incomparable wealth of this metal which was embedded in the temples’s chapels and wall, its ceiling and altars.”
(Father Bernabe Cobo 1653)



82
Considering the immense importance of the Coricancha in Cusco, it would be fascinating if a twin structure had been intentionally built in Llactapata, the two of them serving as opposite ends of the string of royal estates built by the Inca emperor Pachacuti. Questions that arise are why would it not have been built in Machu Picchu using better building material; would royal personages have visited Llactapata regularly for ceremonies considering the difficulty of following the trail across MP peak? What would have happened to gold plating at Llactapata, if it was as elaborate as the Coricancha? An assistant in Llactapata with a mirror a day before June solstice produced a reflection of sunrise visible in the Sacred Plaza 36 minutes before sunrise at Machu Picchu. If the walls of Llactapata were covered with gold plate, that event would have been a stupendous sight viewed from the Intiwatana Pyramid, the Sacred Plaza, or the the elegant Sacistry.

83
A stone-lined water channel leads out of the double jamb doorway of Llactapata toward the sacred plaza of Machu Picchu and beyond to June solstice sunrise. No such channel is evident in the Corichanca, but the north-eastern wall on Avenida Ahuacpinta contains three drainage holes. A basin in the courtyard could have provided water or chicha for offerings to the sun and/or the Pleiades.
We shall compare these two structures in detail, report on new measurements, and describe the results of a recent expedition to the upper reaches of the Aobamba canyon to map the trail between Machu Picchu and Llactapata.

A Condor Shaped Stone Pillar that Marked the Equinox 4,000 Years Ago at the Adean Site of Buena Vista
Robert A. Benfer
University of Missouri, Columbia, USA
At 2000 BC, the sun would have risen on the equinox over a stone pillar in the form of a condor viewed from a temple, the Temple of the Fox at the site of Buena Vista, Perú (Adkins and Benfer 2008; Benfer 2012. The condor in Andean mythology represents the sky and the fox, the earth, and thus they are a dual of one another (Benfer et al. 2011). Here I report an equinoctial sunrise over the stone pillar across two intervening reference points: the pillar, one of a pair, has been retouched into the head of a condor (Figure). It looks up the valley but is oriented to the rise of the Milky Way on the zenith. A second reference point from the Temple of the Fox may also represent a condor. The third is a black cubical rock. Such rocks are also found also in the first steps in two pyramids. The viewing point is from a temple, which has an incised fox at the entry.
In 2009, one of our team, Lucio Laura, discovered the stone pair, one of a pair, that one of two stone pillars we were investigating. It has been retouched into the form of a condor (Figure), which we named Apuchin Laura, after it’s discoverer, in Quechua Apuchin is master of the Apus, the animated mountain peaks. It has parallel flake scars on the perimeter. Subsequent investigation found that although the very top of the condor pillar was barely visible from the entryway to the Temple of the Fox, a very evident black quadrilateral stone attracted the eye in front of it. Subsequent survey showed that the alignment from the Temple entryway to the stone, if continued, struck the condor pillar. Black stones are significant in Late Preceramic Buena Vista. There is a black quadrilateral stone in the center of the first



85
steps up each of two principle pyramids as well as one in the step down behind a sculpture in a special chamber (Benfer 2012).
Later reconnaissance found a projecting stone in the valley down from the condor. We noted it as a probable condor, because such projecting stones are called condors by indigenous peoples in the Andes (e.g., Sanchéz Garrafa 2008). We did not measure its azimuth until later, and were astonished to find that it fell within 0.5o of the azimuth to the Apuchin.
In summary, from the Temple of the Fox, there are three points that lie within 0.5o of one another: the stone projection in the valley, the quadrilateral black rock, and the condor pillar. The azimuth to the quadrilateral black rock 754m distant with an elevation of 25o10' azimuth measured is 84o35'. The equinox of 2200 BC, the age of the Temple of the Fox, would have occurred at 83o50' at that elevation, a difference of 45'.
The September equinoctial sunset would have been marked by sunrise over the condor rock to the east and sunset over a mountain peak to the west. Equinoctial alignments have been suggested for

Meaning and coincidences. A study into the archeoastronomy of Inka structures and their ritual significance
José Nicolás Balbi
Colchester Archaeological Group, United Kingdom and Ministry of Education, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
The present work aims to deepen the study of one of the structures that make up the archaeological site of Shincal, located in the Province of Catamarca, Argentina and relate it to a similar structure in its kind that we have found in the Inka archaeological site of Sondor, Peru. The idea that Inka society would replicate its constructions in several territories and at great distances had already been observed previously (Hylop, 1990; Farrington, 1999).
The initial question of the Shincal Astronomical orientations in general and its ritual meaning was the subject of our presentation in 2017 at the 25th SEAC conference (Corrado, Pino Matos, Benitez, and Balbi) and the purpose of this is to extend the studies to new sectors and structures.
In recent years we have dedicated to the study of one of the structures, called the "Complex 19". For the study of the same we have done 6 campaigns of study some with Marco Giovanetti team, and make Archaeology an Astronomy studies. We have invited Jose Luis Pino Matos from Peru to compare our opinions and our information and we made two study trips with him, Gustavo Corrado and Sixto Gimenez Benitez up the Shincal and to the area of Cuzco, to obtain comparative results and to carry out new studies.
The expeditions were based on carrying out several post-excavation studies that I begin in Complex 19 from 2016. So far we have shown



88
that the structure is cardinally aligned, in agreement with the Shincal, with several constructions aligned both cardinally and equinoctially; that many Shincal structures are copies of the buildings of the Inka capital and its surroundings; the existence of buildings of previous cultures. Complex 19 has an eastern-oriented ceremonial staircase, and between its mountains you can see the aligned structures of the Shincal center, including the Eastern and Western temples. It is important to bear in mind that all of the Astronomical and landscape characteristics, such as the relationship with the surrounding mountains and water sources, which constitute the sacred elements in the genesis of the Inka belief, correspond to "Complex 19". In terms of its orientation, the Shincal ushnu is oriented towards sunrise at the medium temporal equinox and towards the west at Mount Pissis (Corrado et al., 2014, 2015).
The north-south orientation of the temple and the ceremonial staircase to the east, by themselves would be sufficient elements for your Astronomical relationships currently accepted as rituals regarding the Inka question. Also, we discard that it was a military garrison. The beliefs originated in the first archaeological works played down the



89
importance of the ceremonial possibility of the site and for that reason it was known as "The Watchtower", but this is an already overcome theory
Also we try to demonstrate that C19 is related to a similar structure in the Sondor complex, in present-day Peru. The centers of power, the "New Cuzcos" contain Inkan cultural manifestations, but these are not copies or repetitions of their imperial capital, but they sought to adapt to particular situations of the conquered territories (P Matos 2004). This last hypothesis has interesting elements. The construction of the structure in Sondor has similar architectonical characteristics and its cardinal alignment and the undoubted relationship with the landscape and Astronomy, which in Sondor is constituted with the orographic chain and a lake, forming again the Inka genesis in the same way as in the C-19.

Astronomical and Geographical Features of Zhoubi Deduced from Mythology and Gnomonic
Raul Perez-Enriquez
Universidad de Sonora, Hermosillo, Mexico
A document compiled around 100 BCE, the Zhou bi Suanjing (Zhoubi now on) has been recognized, in the past, as a mathematical and astronomical document; and, in this framework, its special features have been analysed [1]. However, its relation with the actual world has been omitted. Using the gnomonic data of the Zhoubi (gnomon’s height and its solstices’ shadows), we have found the Latitude (35.33° N) of the site where observations took place, and the possible Epoch (2900 BC) when they were made, calculated from them. The former helped us to locate an actual city (Jining, Shandong, China) for its identification with the Zhou city; and, the latter allowed us to stablish a correspondence between cultural and mythological information (I Ching book and FuXi's trigrams) with the geographical features of Jining and its surroundings: Both aspects are in harmony through the Cultural background. In our way, a critical approach to Zhoubi book has been adopted: the correspondence between a change of one cun of shadow to a 100 li in distance of the Sun [2]; and, an interesting hypothesis for the origin of trigrams has been followed [3] and confirmed that they may arise from the observation of the shadow of a gnomon over an array of fringes drawn in the earth. Our founding’s have enhanced the special role of gnomonic observations in the history of the millenary Chinese knowledge and the vision of the Zhoubi’s data as a geographical description of the world, based in an Astronomical model with Flat Earth and a Flat Sky where the Sun, Moon and stars move around a point called the Pole.

Calendar meaning of Timber-grave community pottery ornament in accordance with the Vedic tradition of the sacrifice
Andrej Kirillov
Institute for Physics of Mining Processes of the National Аcademy of Science of Ukraine, Dnipro, Ukraine
The description of the periodic ornament along the corolla of a pot belonging to the era of Timber-grave community is presented. Unlike traditional twelve months calendar interpretation of such artifacts, the ornament and the signs are offered to be interpreted as an example of a ten-month calendar divided into five seasons. Such a calendar existed in the early stages of the Vedic society and in ancient Greece and Rome as it well known from the history. The signs capture key points of seasons, so they can be interpreted in accordance with description of the constellations in Hesiod's poem "Works and Days". Variation of month duration is represented as the length of the sides of ornament’s triangles. The creation of the pot and the ornament can

be attributed to about XII BC and the calendar contains information about the duration of daylight at latitude 36oN, as shown with the aid of astronomical planetarium Redshift-4.
In the Vedic tradition, the year was linked to the ritual sacrifice of a horse "asvamedha" and to the altar built for the sacred fire. The altar was composed by a quantity of the bricks and layers that symbolized the structure and the duration of the year. The grouping of sacrificial animals to combination 20 18 = 360 defines the duration of the year and corresponds to the numbers contained in the periodic structure of the pot ornament.

The information of archaeoastronomy in Japan has been limited to the international audience (cf. Sago et al 1986). But this does not mean that archaeoastronomy has never been attempted in Japan. On the contrary, this paper shows that a variety of archaeoastronomical researches have been done in Japan.
After the modernization of Japan, 1868, modern academic disciplines have been introduced to Japan from Europe and U.S.A.. In archaeology as well, Western scholars occupied a leading position at this period, and there were archaeoastronomical studies at this period.
William Gowland, an English man who served as a metallurgical engineer, was also an archaeologist and visited archaeological sites throughout Japan in this holidays. He was a pioneer of scientific research of archaeological sites, using surveying equipment and photography. He was particularly interested in Kofun (burial mounds or tumuli), and pointed out that the orientation of burial chamber was often astronomically decided (1877, 1899). Interestingly enough, his study on Stonehenge using Japanese custom as an ethnological analogy (Gowland 1902) was promptly cited by Norman Locker as an example of the remnant of ancient sun-worship (Locker 1906) .
After Gowland, another English medical doctor, N. Munro did archaeological research and pointed out the possible astronomical significance of stone circle of the Jomon Period in Hokkaido (1911). After these studies, some Japanese archaeologists pursued archaeo-aastronomical studies: the discussions had been largely focused on the burial orientation in Jomon shellmounds, the alignment of stone circle of the Jomon Period, and the orientation of Kofun.



95
In the process of professionalization of archaeology after W.W.II., however, the archaeoastronomical interests tend to be diminished except for a few researchers (e.g. Hideo Fujimoto in Hokkaido studies, Hiroshi Tsude in Kofun studies, etc) in the last 50 years. Only recently, the interest in archaeoastronomy has been revived by Yoshitaka Hojo (2017) and by myself (Goto 2017).
In additon to the burial orientation, stone circles of the Jomon Period, and the orientation of Kofun, the discussion has been recently enlarged to other problems, such as, the landscape (and/or skyscape) of the settlements of Jomon and Yayoi Periods.
In this paper, I will discuss a unique history of archaeoastronomy in Japan with some reference to that in Europe.

Solar Returns: From observing the sky to observing birthdays
Astrid B. Leimlehner
Independent Scholar Linz, Austria
This paper explores the social role and the individual meaning of birthdays which are, astronomically speaking, solar returns and thus a cosmic regularity.
Theoretical background
Catherine Bell, writing about rituals, states that ‘[s]ome occasions
are reckoned according to the Solar calendar and therefore occur on
the same date every year’ which applies to birthdays.14 Birthdays thus can be seen as ‘calendrical rites’ giving socially meaningful definitions to the passage of time, creating an ‘ever renewing cycle’.15
In 1952, the anthropologists Ralph and Adelin Linton highlighted that birthday celebrations happened only after humans had learned to record time and had developed a calendar.16 Mesopotamian and Egyptian kings and nobles gave birthday feasts while lower classes did not know their birthdays. Birth records were kept only for royal children for casting horoscopes in order to find out their destinies.17 Ancient Greeks, the authors wrote, celebrated the gods’ birthdays monthly assuming relationships between deities and humans born on the same day. The authors claimed that the custom of birthday cakes with candles goes back to observing Artemis’ birthday by placing

round honey cakes with tapers on her altar.18 Parke confirms this cult, but not the connection to contemporary practices.19 The authors further stated that to commemorate Plato’s birthday, new students joined the Athenian academy on the seventh day of the month.20
In 1992, Kathryn Argetsinger found in birthday poems of the first century BCE that, next to public birthdays (of temples, cities and emperors) Romans marked private birthdays with gift giving, banquets and religious rituals.21 At an altar, decorated with flowers and a holy fire, the celebrant, wearing a white robe, offered incense, wine and honey cakes to his/her personal spirit, called genius (for men) and Juno natalis (for women).22 Family and friends were present or even involved in the ritual action or, if unable to attend, performed a ritual independently for the celebrant’s spirit.23 Romans also felt obliged to celebrate a patron’s birthday to express gratitude and respect. For some, Argetsinger says, a friend’s or patron’s birthday was equally or even more important than their own.24 Its observance defined and expressed the celebrant’s position and relationships within the social network.25 Rituals on private patrons’ birthdays, she concludes,

formed the basis for establishing public birthday celebrations for emperors as patrons and protectors of the Roman people.26
The Research Project
Two men and four women, aged between 35 and 65, three British and three Austrian citizens, volunteered in giving semi-structured interviews. For data protection reasons they are identified by a P (participant) plus serial numbers in the order of the interviews.
P3, the exception among the participants, does not celebrate his own birthday as it has no meaning for him, but helps others to celebrate theirs.
Further results suggest that the participants’ birthday celebrations are socially meaningful ritual-like actions defining and strengthening social relationships. Regular customs are taking this day off and a special meal with family and/or friends, a basic genre of ritual action defining a social community. For five participants, a birthday cake is a special treat that they like to have every year. A festive table is not important to the British, but very much to the Austrian participants. Their descriptions (flowers, candles, cake) resemble the Roman ritual altars. Receiving congratulations and good wishes, especially as a return of the favour, is important to five participants as these express feelings of closeness and affection.
For most participants, birthdays are celebrations of life. They want this day to stand out from others, thus mark it as non-profane time (e.g. no work), but do not give it the meaning of sacred time like in late republican Rome. The birthday viewed as a personal holiday implies that the participants have a qualitative and cyclical perception
26 Argetsinger, Birthday Rituals, p.193.



99
of time.27 The idea that birthdays have a different meaning depending on a linear or cyclical perception of time might lead to further research.
By celebrating collective rituals like Christmas and Easter, Brady says, we co-create the seasonal cycle. Birthday celebrations have seemingly a similar function on an individual level. As calendrical rituals they create the individual’s ‘ever renewing cycle’.

The 19-year Luni-solar Cycle of the Odyssey, the Pylos Combat Warrior Seal and the Antikythera Mechanism
Florence Star Wood
Independent Scholar, Bolton, UK
Nearly three millennia have passed since Homer (c. 745-700 BC) sat under the clear skies of ancient Greece and wove threads of time-honoured myths about the Trojan War and the adventures of Odysseus into the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the long distant past, Homer was considered to be an astronomer as well as a story-teller as shown in Heraclitus’s Fragments (535-475BC), ‘Homer the astronomer, considered wisest of all Greeks.1 The pre-literate Greeks required a method for preserving crucialastronomical andtime-keeping for theorganisation of their lives.
The Iliad sets out the fundamentals of astronomy: identification of stars and constellations, an earth-centred universe, movement of the heavens, and an awareness of Precession of the Equinoxes, and knowledge of astronomy assimilatedthrough thecenturies beforeHomer’s times.2However,theastronomical contentoftheOdysseyisquitedifferentfromthatoftheIliad. ThescholarGilbert Murray was aware that the Odyssey is ‘myth ..... it is a matter of the solar and lunar calendar.’ 3 Murray didnot elaborate the point.
The luni-solar calendar of the Odyssey is found by recognizing that the moon is the ‘tally stick of time.’4 The calendar is divided into a 29 or 30 day months, 12 or13 month years, 45- 50 month ‘Olympiads’, 99 month Venus rhythms, 4 x 235 Callippic cycles and 223 months of the Saros Series. Analysis of the plethora of numbers embeddedinthe Odysseyareevidenceenoughofalunarbasedcalendar. Meanwhile, Odysseus’s exploits are metaphorical descriptions of the constellationsinwhichthe sun lies during a particular lunation. Combination of the two yields a luni-solar calendar.
Current investigations include the recently displayed 3.6cm long Pylos Combat Warrior Agate Seal (1500BC), discovered by archaeologists from



101
the University of Cincinnati, and the Antikythera Mechanism, dated perhaps to the 1st century BC. 700 years earlier than Homer, the Pylos Combat Warrior Agate Seal depicts a warrior being struck in the throat with a sword, reminiscent of Achilles overcoming Hector in the Iliad. The minute details, some not even seen by the naked eye evokes Homer’s astronomical description of the death of Hector. (HSI, (Fig.13, p77). Believed to have originated some 700 years later than Homer, the Antikythera Mechanism’s complex gearing has been revealed by computer x-rays through a team from Cardiff University. They have found the synodic month, tropical years, together with the Metonic, Olympiad, Octaetris and Callippic cycles as well as the Saros series – all identical to those verbally expressed in lunations embedded in the Odyssey.
Both artefacts reveal craftsmanship and technological skills far beyond those capabilities we thought possible by the ancient Greeks. The oral tales of the Iliad and the Odyssey, their original purpose long hidden, show a similar complexity to both artefacts. In the history of ancient Greek civilizations, Homer stands mid-way between the Pylos Combat Warrior Seal and the Antikythera Mechanism.

Structure of the sacred space, astronomical orientation and functional evolution of the rock-cut monument near the village of Lilych, Kyustendil region, Bulgaria

Introduction: One of the most interesting rock - cut monuments with arches on the Bulgarian lands is the rock sanctuary in the Cherkvishte locality near the village of Lilyach. We have conducted an archaeoastronomical and ethnographic research of this large rock complex. It is located about 2 km northeast of the village. It is situated on a high plateau hill, which has an impressive view to the Konyavska Mountain and the Rila and Malashevska Mountains. In the late 19th century here was built a church dedicated to Saint George, which inherited an older Christian temple. The church was renovated in 1925 and even today the village festival is held here. The hill is surrounded by a rock wreath of 5 to 10 meters in height from the east-southeast side. Rock chapel and group of tunnels, passages and rock niches, considered sacred still in prehistoric times are situated at its southeast part. Several significant rock cuttings are located at the top of the rocks.
Research: In the system of rock galleries, passages, arches, rocks and cuttings of the sanctuary orientations located mainly in the east-west and north-south axes, are mentioned. After the rock chapel, oriented east - west, we reach a narrow, 7 m long tunnel with a north-south orientation formed at the base of the eastern part of the sanctuary. The cross section at the end of the tunnel is in the form of a phallus. On the eastern part of it is clearly visible the image of a female face



103
turned to the south. The tunnel extends to a rock ground. Two separate rock blocks are located to the west of the ground. The base of the first is shaped as passage arch. Its opening is about 0.30 m in height and its length is 1.5 m. Orientation of its main axis is towards the sunrise at the point of winter solstice (southeast, accuracy of orientation is 1о). A large rock arch (about 2.5 m high) with a triangle cross section is formed from the rock block with the passage arch and the main rock, and occupies a dominant position in the complex. Its main axis is oriented to the east, to the sunrise point above the local horizon on the days of equinox. Solar projections in the early morning hours during equinoxes are marked on the floor like circles.
Fig. 1. Phallic cross section at the end of the tunnel oriented north-south and the female face turned to the south.



104
The original form of the rock chapel was a small break into the rock above, covered by stone blocks locked in the crack. The chapel has the characteristics of a rock cave and can be considered as the Christian home of the Great Mother-Goddess of Ancient Thrace. The main axis of the cave is oriented with great accuracy in the direction east-west (accuracy 1о).
Conclusion: The rock sanctuary we studied in the Cherkvishte locality near the village of Lilyach is connected with the vernal equinox and winter solstice. Obviously, it has several cult centers deeply connected with the Great Mother-Goddess and the Sun. The mysterious cult of the new birth, reincarnation and immortality is preserved until late in the Bulgarian folk culture in the traditional ritual for treatment of the female infertility, by ritual passing through the rock arch oriented towards the winter solstice (Markov, 2003).
Solar cult is associated with the male divinity in Thrace, identified with the Sun, with Dionysus-Sabazius. From the eastern direction come the rays of the rising in the morning Sun and fall into the rock arch, symbolizing the womb of the Great Mother-Goddess, identified with the Earth. This is a kind of natural code of sacred marriage between the supreme male and the supreme female god in Ancient Thrace. Indicative in this respect are the phallic cross section of the tunnel oriented north - south and the female face turned to the south on its eastern part.

The Hittite Rock Sanctuary of Yazılıkaya: A Luni
solar Calendar from c. 1250 B.C.
Eberhard Zangger, Rita Gautschy
Luwian Studies, Zurich, Switzerland University of Basel, Department of Ancient Civilizations, Basel, Switzerland
Material studied
The Hittite rock sanctuary of Yazılıkaya in central Anatolia contains over ninety rock-cut reliefs of deities, humans, animals, and mythical figures dating to the second half of the 13th century B.C. (Seeher 2011). The site’s function has thus far remained enigmatic. A few elements indicate astronomical orientations: e.g. one prominent relief of Great King Tudḫaliya IV only catches sunlight during afternoons around the summer solstice, while the northern wall of the gatehouse is oriented towards sunset at the summer solstice.
Goals
Such observations indicate that the Yazılıkaya sanctuary had a practical purpose, probably in connection with astronomical determination of time. For instance, Chambers A and B exhibit reliefs with 12 uniform male gods, possibly indicating the 12 gods of the lunar calendar (and thus the months). This incited the working hypothesis that the entire sanctuary may have been used to record astronomical observations and to keep track of time in one way or another. Our goal was to determine whether the sanctuary had a practical purpose associated with astronomy/astrology and keeping track of time.
Methods
For the archaeoastronomical analysis of the rock sanctuary of Yazılıkaya and its surroundings we used horizon profiles based on topographic data generated from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) with a resolution of about 90 m, backed by locally generated horizon panoramas. For the calculation of the position of the sun and the moon we employed our own computer programs,



106
which use the long-term DE 406 ephemerides of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Standish 1998). The position of fixed stars such as Sirius and the Pleiades were calculated for 1250 B.C. starting from their coordinates in the year 2000 (Perryman et al. 1997). Our computations take account of the effects of precession, nutation, changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic in the course of time, and the proper motion of the stars.
Discussion
We observed that the reliefs in Chamber A form certain groups. The number of elements in each group is 12, 1, 29, 5 and 19. These numbers – and thus the relief groups – can be correlated to basic astronomical periods: - Reliefs 1-12 and 13: Number of lunar months per solar year (12+1) - Relief 13: Intercalary lunar month as well as day 30 of the lunar month - Reliefs 13 and 14-41: Number of days per lunar month (1+29) - Reliefs 42-46: Main group, no function as a calendrical tool - Reliefs 46a-63: 19 solar years Accordingly, Reliefs 1-12 would reflect lunar months each with a duration of 29 or 30 days. Relief 13 would have been needed for the intercalary month that had to be added every 2-3 years to keep lunar and solar years in line and to make sure that the months always coincided with the appropriate seasons.
The system recorded in Yazılıkaya may therefore constitute a lunisolar calendar that could have yielded different degrees of precision. Different astronomical phenomena could have been used



107



108
to determine when an intercalary month is necessary: either the heliacal rising or heliacal setting of a bright star, the illumination effect of Tudḫaliya’s relief, or a more sophisticated regular intercalation pattern such as the Octaëteris or the Enneadecaëteris (later known as the Metonic Cycle).
We conclude that the reliefs in Chamber A are arranged in groups for the purpose of keeping track of lunar months, the days of a lunar month, and years. By marking the days and synodic months, the Hittite priests were able to determine when additional months were required to keep lunar and solar years aligned. The sanctuary’s Chamber B was perfectly set up for use as a star clock to tell the time during the night.

A robust statistical significance test for the orientation of archaeological structures

For at least the past four decades archaeoastronomical research has been put under the scrutiny of statistical analyses both by adherents and detractors. The need to argue for intentionality of any identified alignments, especially in the absence of independent socio-cultural evidence or context, has driven archaeoastronomers towards statistical reasoning in an attempt to assess whether or not such alignments could occur by chance alone – that is, to assess their statistical significance. This, at one point named ‘green’, methodology usually consists in the surveying of a large number of similar structures and subsequent quantitative analyses of the gathered data. The concern for intentionality has been addressed, for example, using the Bernoulli trial equation, which estimates the probability of finding alignments by chance (e.g. Thom 1971, Ruggles 1999). However, this is often intractable to apply to larger datasets that display less homogeneity in orientation and measurement uncertainty. Despite its old concern with statistical significance, archaeoastronomy hasn’t been able to fully engage with what is not only the most widely recognised and established statistical tool but is also the most appropriate to assess statistical significance: null hypothesis testing and the p-values that result from it (e.g. Wasserstein and Lazar 2016).
This paper will present a methodology that is equally inspired by past attempts to quantify significance in curvigrams (e.g. González-García & Belmonte 2011; González-García & Sprajc 2016) and by current



110
advancements in statistical analyses of radiocarbon dates (e.g. Shennan et al 2013, Silva and Vander Linden 2017). The methodology is based on the explicit comparison of the curvigram derived from the fieldwork data with the expected curvigrams under the null hypothesis and the characteristics (sample size, uncertainty profile) of the empirical sample. This is done through a three-stage process where, firstly, a null hypothesis is chosen and a probability density function (pdf) that represents it is constructed – for example the null hypothesis of random orientation can be represented by a probability density function that is uniform in azimuth (i.e. all directions are equally likely to occur by chance). From this pdf a random sample of the same size as the empirical dataset is retrieved and used to construct a curvigram using the empirical uncertainty profile. This is repeated a large number of times so as to construct a confidence interval around the null model, which is to say the range of curvigram “shapes” expected to be observed under the null hypothesis. Regions of the empirical curvigram that lie outside this confidence interval are statistically significant and this can be quantified using a p-value.
This method is demonstrably robust – e.g. it works for any sample size – and because it quantifies statistical significance via a p-value, it has the potential to raise our profile within other fields, such as archaeology and anthropology, that are already conversant with significance testing and p-values. We argue that this is an important development not just for future studies but also to reassess past data collections and related inferences and we will demonstrate it by applying it to a number of already datasets in the literature (e.g. Ruggles 1999).

Politics, Harmony and Managing Change in Kepler's Astronomy.
Nicholas Campion
University of Wales Trinity Saint David, UK
This paper will explore Johannes Kepler’s political astronomy-astrology, honouring Kepler’s position as a former teacher of mathematics in Graz, the venue for the 2018 SEAC conference.
Material Studied
Kepler’s primary texts, including the Tertius Interveniens, annual prognostications and horoscopes.
Goal
My goal is to establish a better understanding of Kepler’s work within 17th century culture.
Method
My method is historical/archival
Discussion
Kepler was motivated partly by the desire to establish a more accurate astronomy, one purpose being to solve the problems of political instability. The Thirty Years War, which devastated parts of central Europe, broke out in 1618, the same rear as his essential text book on Copernicanism, the Epitome of Copernican Astronomy, and a year before the Harmonices Mundi. As is well known Kepler provided astrological advice for Albrecht von Wallenstein, the imperial general, and so the last of Europe’s great military astrologers. Kepler’s relationship with Wallenstein has been systematically misrepresented. In Caspar’s strangely dismissive judgment, his willingness to consult ‘the stars regarding all his political and martial decisions and transactions’ was evidence that he was ‘caught in astrological delusion’, as if this was a kind of psychological sickness rather than standard behaviour for the time. Kepler’s relationship with Wallenstein began in



113
1608 when an intermediary obtained a lengthy written analysis (possibly anonymous) of Wallenstein’s birth chart.
Of the astronomers responsible for the astronomical revolution, Kepler’s astrology is the most well known although it is largely ignored by scholars of his work. Kepler believed that astrology was part of the divinely ordered cosmos, a means of understanding God’s plan and marvelling at his works. From 1602 he also produced annual prognostications, in order to build up a body of empirically-based, reliable astrological rules. He discussed probabilities for the coming year’s weather, harvests and political developments, steering away from precise forecasts. Where he did make a definite statement, he was quick to qualify it. For January 1602 he considered, on the basis of a prolonged sextile (600 separation) between Mars and Saturn, that ‘there will be a vehement commotion and a very definite excess in atmospheric conditions. But’, he added, ‘it is not easy to say how the excess will be manifested’. A notable example was in his diary for 1618 in which, building his astrological judgement carefully upon previous examples, he wrote,
My fundamental argument is this: that a Conjunction of Mars and the Sun takes place next March in Aries, under the influence of which Germany stands; while numerous Conjunctions take place in May in Taurus near the Plejades; and that we have precedents to show us the effects of such aspects in definite instances, as in the Peasants’ War in 1525, in the Revolt in the Netherlands in 1565, and in 1604 in Hungary.
On 23 May 1618, as the Moon was in Taurus, between Mars and Saturn, as identified by Kepler, the defenestration of Prague launched the Thirty Years War. The making of predictions required Kepler to take a position in relation to the thorny problem of determinism, whether the fulfilment of a forecast meant that it was predetermined, and he was quite clear that the Taurean alignments did not indicate that war was inevitable. Instead, he advocated a mixture of social reform and



114
tough government to ward off revolution, and strong generalship to win wars. Kepler wanted to achieve this by a stripped down, simplified astrology.
Conclusion
My paper will argue that Kepler’s understanding of astrology, politics and fate led him to take up an embryonic social-democratic position, in which reform is a necessary political action to ward off revolution.

The harmony of J. Kepler. Elliptical form in geometry and music
Uliva Velo
University of Ferrara, Italy
The German astronomer and scientist Johannes Kepler is well-known for his innovative reinterpretation of the astronomical structure of the planetary system. From his first essay Mysterium Cosmographicum (1595) – in which he remains attached to a Platonic vision of the planetary order, incorporating it within a framework influenced by the revolutionary discoveries of Nicolaus Copernicus who placed the sun at the centre of the astronomical system – to the Harmonices Mundi (1619) Kepler’s ideas developed in a remarkable way. Studying under Tycho Brahe in 1600, from the great Danish scientist he inherited numerous astronomical data that became the foundation on which he would later formulate his three laws of planetary motion.
In Astronomia Nova (1609) Kepler describes his various attempts to fit the data collected by Brahe concerning the movement of Mars into the Ptolemaic and Copernican interpretation of the circular orbits of planets, though without success. The discrepancy between the data and their “traditional” representation led to his assertion and demonstration of the fact that the planets moved around the sun in elliptical orbits, eccentric to the sun which is situated on one focus of the ellipse. If this treatise is important for Kepler’s “formal” interpretation of planetary motion, the Harmonices Mundi is unique for its treatment of the interdependence of music and astronomy through the common language of geometry. Kepler used music as a spiritual basis for his scientific theories and to explain the prevailing harmony of the universe, placing himself in a long-standing tradition though referring to polyphonic music according to contemporary developments in the musical field.

The progress of scientific thought in the course of history has been marked by crucial turning-points not only in its own discipline, but also in the perception man has regarding his place in the world. Eliocentric theory, for example, destabilized the centuries-long belief in the fulcral position of the Earth in the astronomical system as it was then known.
These evolutionary passages are found in individuals’ various forms of intellectual expression. In particular, when analyzing their repercussions in architecture and music, the ideas underlying architectural and musical composition are revealed. It emerges that these have common roots according to interrelated concepts that are reflected in either one discipline or the other.
In an analysis of this subject in western civilization it has emerged that in time the significant idea of this relationship changes and three fundamental concepts can be identified, in which the interconnection between measure, number, geometry and time express a tension towards an ideal meaning of the creative act:
• number: an abstract and unchanging entity that qualifies the components of architecture and of music in a continuous relationship with the metaphysical world; • form: a concrete concept that defines various canons of architectural and musical composition through the dynamism of figures used with innovation; • expression: personalization of the mark/expression that becomes itself architectural and musical project, according to rules modulated on a contingency basis. In the case analysed here, the ellipse, already in use in some instances and later developed exhaustively in the buildings of the baroque period, was an absolute novelty in the scientific field. By means of the same geometrical figure, architecture and astronomy worked a mutation in the structure and the perception of space, both on the microscopic level of buildings and on the macroscopic level of the solar system. Such an innovation compared to the mentality of the past, which



117
was based on figures like circles and squares, was also incorporated into music with the development of increasingly complex musical forms.
The figure of Kepler is important, therefore, not only for his scientific contribution to the history of astronomy, but also for the applicative process in which he identified geometry as a linking element between astronomy and music. Indeed, geometry (concrete compared to the pure abstraction of arithmetic), astronomy (the study of large masses in motion) and polyphonic music (proportion among numbers) are brought together in a combination whose originality is truly fascinating.
The movements of the heavens are nothing other than a perpetual symphony (rational, not vocal) which moves, through dissonances, through as it were certain suspensions or cadential formulae (through which men imitate the natural dissonances) towards definite, prescribed cadences... (J. Kepler, Harmonice Mundi, 1619).

Kepler’s calculations of the Creation’s date, com
pared to Dionysius Exiguus’ Adjustment of Anno
Domini
Sepp Rothwangl
Independent Researcher, Wien, Austria
In 1596 Johannes Kepler wrote in his Mysterium Cosmographicum: “If we equate the year 1595 of the Christian era with the year 5572 (usually the best warrantors count it as 5557) then the creation falls into an exquisite constellation at the beginning of Aries.” Kepler’s “best warrantors” is evidently the Protestant reformer Luther, who dated the creation at exactly the same year. Kepler then calculated a horoscope of this date, but could not find significance. He draw a different horoscope hereafter, representing the conjunction of creation, in order to harmonize it with the heliocentric world view of Copernicus, who said that „the Earth initially was at the same starting place as the other planets.“
In his work “De temporis initio; De mundi aetate” Kepler combined the seven-day-concept and the fictitious date of Christ’s birth in a similar way as already in 6th century Dionysius Exiguus when “inventing” the Anno Domini yearcount. With this idea, Kepler is closely aligned with the doctrine of the Great Year. He tries to bring it into symmetrical harmony with heliocentrism. In an image, he presents the ideal ephemerides of the planets as they would have been positioned at the creation. This graphical representation readily illustrates his harmonic idea.
Later on, based upon planetary periods, Kepler calculated a different date of creation of the world some 4000 years before Christ.

The regularities of the celestial forces: the concept of sun and moon in Igbo world view
Barth Chukwuezi
Dept of sociology/Anthropology, University of Nigeria Nsukka, Nigeria
Since human existence, the celestial forces especially the sun, moon, stars, sky, rainbow etc have had an overbearing influence on humans, In-fact human social structure and social organization in many traditional societies are informed by the knowledge of the celestial forces, Chukwuezi (2006) has discussed how cosmic forces impinge on human organization in a paper delivered at the African Astronomy Conference in Ghana. The regularities of the sun and moon in Igbo existence has very wide concept in Igbo world view which informs the various social structure and social organization of the Igbo society. The Igbo are a cultural ethnic group found in eastern part of Nigeria and have come to identify the regularities of the sun and moon in their world view which inform their varying forms of social structure and social organization encouraging various activities. The Igbo world view is the basic concept of ideologies and activities which influences Igbo orientation in their existential world which gives meaning to the various forms of social structure and social organization. It is seen as the various way the Igbo configure their existence in both physical and spiritual context which affects their various levels of social organization.
The sun rises regularly in the east and sets in the west. The moon equally appears at certain periods of the month. The sun has various male attributes so also the moon. The sun is a life force, giver of light and vitality which orders the affairs of human. The sun is seen as a male god with so much vitality and energy and it commands a lot of awe and respect. The moon has some special attributes as well which gives meaning to certain forms of existence in Igbo society. These



121
attributes of the sun and the moon which are morphological, social cultural and spiritual in nature will be discussed.
The paper will explore the various underlying facets and spiritual correlation of Igbo world view and social organization informed by socio cultural attributes of the sun and moon.

Origins of Ka’ba and The Celestial Order
Reza Assasi
Centennial College, Toronto, Canada
Ka’ba, Islam’s most sacred building located in Mecca, takes its name from the geometrical form of its structure. In Arabic language it literally means Cube. There are not many reliable historical reports about the origins of its construction, however, the building had been a significant sacred temple for the pre-Islamic tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. The Islamic narratives date its origin to the time of Adam and Abraham. Quran calls this place “the ancient house”.
Among the important cities in the Arabian Peninsula and the Red Sea trade route Mecca is in geographic proximity of the Tropic of Cancer. Also, it is believed that Ka’ba originally had only four walls with no roofs. These facts could have played an important role in the construction of this type of structure, which none of its four walls cast shadow during the summer solstice noon solar zenith passage. The Islamic narratives also supports this notion where Ka’ba reported to have a celestial counterpart right above it in the fourth sky, metaphorically representing the Sun’s place in the seven planetary spheres.
Most of the pre-Islamic pilgrimage rituals taking place in this site were also adopted by Islam. One of these rituals is tawaf that requires the pilgrims to perform seven circumambulations around Ka’ba with three rounds at a fast pace and four rounds at a slow pace, another strong metaphoric reference to the planetary orbits with an emphasis on the fourth celestial orbit.
Although there is only one sacred stone (the Black Stone) was kept in Ka’ba, the Islamic reports mention that Ka’ba hosted 360 idols (probably resembling the solar cycle) that all were destroyed by Muhammad when he conquered Mecca in 629 CE.



123
In this study the author analyzes the first hand and second hand Islamic literature, the related historical reports, the rituals, and the physical evidence to create a rational framework to demonstrate the parallels between the original concept of Ka’ba and its rituals with the astronomical phenomena. Although there is no clear historical statement to address the origins of Ka’ba, almost all available data, including the Islamic narratives, suggest the importance of the celestial order in the foundation of this site and its associated rituals.

A New Light on the Central Instrument of the Samarqand Observatory
S. Mohammad Mozaffari,1 Georg Zotti2
1 Research Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics of Maragha (RIAAM), Iran 2 Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, Vienna, Austria
About the first half of 994 AD, Abū Maḥmūd Ḥāmid b. al-Khiḍr al
Khujandī (ca. 945–1000) built a gigantic instrument, the so-called Fakhrī sextant, exclusively for the measurement of the obliquity of the ecliptic near Ray (near modern Tehran). It has been described in a treatise by al-Khujandī himself, in two works by his younger contemporary, Abū al-Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048), as well as in a
13th-century encyclopedia of the astronomical instruments com
piled by al-Marrākushī (d. 1262 AD), in which the procedure of its
construction is explained as follows: After marking the meridian line on the ground, two walls of ~ 10 m height are erected equidistant from it, with a distance of ~ 3.5 m between them. At the top, an arch is built between them from the south with a round aperture of radius ~ 20 cm in its apex. Directly below the centre of the aperture, the ground is excavated ~ 10 m. A prolonged solid hollow iron rod of ~ 20 m in length is hung by two rings from the horizontal diameter of the aperture; this serves as the radius of the circle, of which the sextant is an arc, and is rotated within the excavation to make an arc of one-sixth of a circle. The resulting curved excavation is made smooth and uniform, covered with wooden planks and equalin-size brass plates forming its upper surface, and then is graduated to 60° (corresponding to a length of ~ 34.9 cm per degree); the two degree-divisions that are thought to be the limits of the ecliptic obliquity are divided into 360 equal subdivisions, each of which represents 10′′ (~ 1 mm in length). On its application, we are told: When the Sun reaches the meridian circle, its rays shine through the aperture onto the meridian line, so that the size of the sunbeam is spread in the shape of a cone which is greater than that of the aperture. An auxiliary device is made in the shape of an armilla, in which



125
the two perpendicular diameters are fixed, and whose size is equal to that of the sunbeam located on the surface of the sextant. When the sunbeam falling on the ground approaches the meridian line, this device is put on it and is moved slowly, as the sunbeam moves, until the sunbeam meets the meridian line. So, the position of the centre of the sunbeam in the meridian circle is obtained by it, from which the meridian altitude of the Sun is known. In practice, the instrument did no longer work perfectly after a while; as Khujandī informed Bīrūnī orally about a discrepancy in the sextant, the aperture had subsided downward by ~ 20 cm. We must assume this was an undesirable, but quite expectable, consequence on account of the two tall walls being erected just on either side of a deep excavation. About four centuries later, another model of the Fakhrī sextant has been described in Ghiyāt al-Dīn Jamshīd al-Kāshī’s (ca. 1380–1429) On observational instruments, before he joined Ulugh Beg (1394–1449) in the Samarqand observatory; it was published by Kennedy (1961) on the basis of an unillustrated codex preserved in the University of Leiden (Or. 945). Except for its name, there is no similarity between the two models. According to al-Kāshī, the cylindrical stone sextant is ~ 40 m in length (radius) and ~ 2 m in width, its northern height is ~ 20 m and its southern height ~ 1/2 m, and it has a canal on its upper surface, 8 cm in width and 2 cm in depth. Nothing more is told about how to utilize it. It is similar in size to the remnants of the gigantic stone cylinder of radius ~ 40 m
in the Samarqand observatory, with the exception that analogous to
Khujandī’s description, a part of the latter is buried beneath ground.
Until now, it has been taken for granted among the historians of
medieval astronomy that the instrument was in practice used in the
same way as Khujandī’s model. In the 1980s, E. Piini (1986) imag
ined that the instrument must have been utilized by means of an auxiliary device as shown in the Figure (from Piini 1986), but such an intuitive reconstruction was apparently ignored since then due to not having any historical background.



126
The recently-considered piece of evidence that casts light on how the central instrument of the Samarqand observatory worked in reality can be found just in that very treatise by al-Kāshī. Its three other manuscripts preserved in Tehran are illustrated, in which the Fakhrī sextant is shown with a “parallel implement” movable on “wheels” carrying a long alidade (“perpendicular pillar”) mounted on it which has two sighting “pinnulas” with tiny holes in their centers. We want to present a virtual reconstruction of this auxiliary device together with the central instrument of the Samarqand observatory.

Numerical, Geometric and Orientation Properties
of “Steppe Geoglyphs” in Kazakhstan
Nyssanbay Bekbassar
Independent Reasercher, Almaty, Kazakhstan
Dozens of mysterious geoglyphs had been discovered in Kazakhstan by an amateur archaeologist in last decade. Researchers have surveyed sites using satellite images from Google Earth. The press hailed the find the "Nazca Lines of Kazakhstan".
Though barely noticeable on the ground, the forms take on a dazzling array of shapes, including huge rings, crosses, circles, squares, lines and a triskelion, named three-fold swastika, when seen from high above. They are some of the many intricate designs of the enigmatic and ancient geoglyphs, formed by man-made mounds, trenches and shafts - spread across the vast northern steppe of Kazakhstan.
Unlike the famous Nazca lines in Peru, mostly the shapes of the Geoglyphs of Turgai are consist from dotted lines of circular mounds of earth about 0.2-1.0 meters high and 10 -12 meters wide range in size from 90 to 435 meters. But archaeologists disagree on the age, purpose, and even the number of the features, which are reaping widespread publicity thanks to dramatic satellite images released recently by NASA.
An international team, led by Andrey Logvin of Kostanay University, has studied two of about 60 discovered sites. Since the team could not find organic material that would provide radiocarbon dates, it used the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating technique that gave ca. 800 BC. So they were built at the beginning of Kazakhstan's Iron Age.
Main questions are when, why and who constructed these great earthworks. The purpose of these features is even less clear than their age. At this point, nobody knows whether the formations have a



130
practical purpose or were solely intended as artistic expression. It is thought the geoglyphs served religious purposes and might have been used for funeral ceremonies. They might also have served as family or tribal symbols, or were a means of marking ownership of the land or might be related to the migration of the saiga antelope, a nearly extinct mammal that once was a mainstay prey of Kazakh hunters.
An interdisciplinary approach is needed to apply for the full investigation of the geometrical earthworks of Kazakhstan. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the numerical. geometric and orientation properties of these sprawling structures of the Turgai deflection. Also, we discuss the possible relationship of these geometric forms with the cosmological perception in the symbolic culture of the nomadic peoples of Central Asia.

The calendrical period of 13 days as a basis to explain the solar orientation of architectural structures in Mesoamerica
Jesús Galindo Trejo
Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico
Over the course of several decades, the solar orientation of architectural structures in Mesoamerica has been investigated (Galindo Trejo, 1994, 2016; Sprajc, 2001, 2003). Although astronomical orientations have been identified towards the sunrise and the sunset at important astronomical moments, such as solstices, equinoxes and the days of the cenital passage of the Sun, the great majority of the orientations does not correspond to important astronomical moments in the apparent movement of the Sun in the horizons. It is possible to organize these orientations according to the solar alignment dates. After a direct analysis it turns out that the distribution of these dates seems to be grouped around certain dates whose main characteristic is that they differ from the natural pivot of a solstice by a multiple number of 13 days. It is well known that the 13-day period is an essential element that structures the Mesoamerican calendrical system. Various proposals have been made to explain the origin of this period. In this paper we propose an observational origin of 13 where the solar disk is the protagonist in terms of the easily identifiable space-time interdependence from observation with the naked eye. The only element that differs from this order is the 73-day period, before and after some solstice. Note, however, that 73 is fundamental because it closes the relation of the commensurability of the solar and the ritual counts: 52x365days= 73x260days. Due to this peculiar way of choosing dates of solar alignment of buildings, and even of urban layout, it can be affirmed that Mesoamericans orientate towards time and not so much towards space. It is clearly a way of worshiping the calendar that



132
was considered as a result of the action of the gods, they created time and organized it for the better functioning of society. This practice of architectural orientation prevailed from the beginning of the pre-classical period, for several millennia. Even some cities in modern Mexico, founded on prehispanic settlements, still show this solar orientation based on the structure of the Mesoamerican calendar. Numerous examples of Mesoamerican orientations are presented following this pattern of organization.

The use of the Palenque ratio in the Lunar Series as a means to preserve the legitimacy of the ruling dynasty of the Palenque kingdom
Stanislaw Iwaniszewski
Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia - Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Mexico City, Mexico
Intercalation – adding a day to a standard lunar month of 29 days was practiced among the Maya, to accord the predicted moon to the observational one. A Maya lunar month extended from the first visibility of the lunar crescent in the western sky (First Moon) to the next such first visibility, though at some sites and periods, the Maya counted the lunar month from one conjunction of Sun and Moon to the next. Throughout most of Mayan history, no pattern in the distribution of intercalary months was detected, it was only in Late Classic times at Xultun that a regular intercalation cycle of 4784 days was detected (Saturno et al. 2012a, 2012b). The use of this period at Palenque was already inferred by John E. Teeple (1931) who reconstructed the presence of the lunar equation of 81 moons = 2392 days in its seventh-century texts. Thanks to the efforts of epigraphers we know the first sighting of the Moon was referred to as the “arrival,” and on occasions, Maya scribes used the same expression to denote the arrival of the rulers to take the throne. In such a way astronomical phenomena became connected with the political actions of a ruling elite. The sites with such metaphorical expressions usually adopt Teeple’s uniform system of reckoning moons (Iwaniszewski 2017).
Palenque under the rulership of K’inich Janaab Pakal I, the famous Maya king ruling from 615 to 683, was slowly recovering from military defeats suffered at the turn of VI and VII centuries. To maintain the leadership achieved by the ruling family, Pakal’s son, K'inich Kan Bahlam II, made various attempts to provide dynastic legitimization. According to Aldana (2007), the invention of the esoteric 819-Day



134
Count (based on multiplications of 7 x 9 x 13) was a means to provide legitimation for the dynasty by connecting mythological protectors of the ruling family to its historical rulers.
My research shows that the lunar dates that were calculated to connect historical dates with the mythological ones employed the Palenque formula. Nonetheless, the Lunar Series embedded within historical texts displayed different patterns. It may be expected that successful predictions of the lunar motion represented through the invention of the Palenque ratio encouraged Maya scribes to apply this formula to the events happening in the remote past. At the same time, however, it seems to be of reduced relevance for historical events. If this reading of the use of the Lunar Series at Palenque is correct, then the invention of the Palenque formula should be interpreted as part of a broader effort by Kan Bahlam priest-astronomers to preserve the legitimacy of his ruling family.

Solar alignments and observational techniques in Mesoamerica
Ivan Šprajc
Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Ljubljana, Slovenia
Systematic archaeoastronomical research in Mesoamerica has revealed that most of the civic and ceremonial buildings were oriented to the Sun's positions on the horizon on certain dates, which cluster in four agriculturally significant periods of the year. Since the dates recorded by a particular structure tend to be separated by multiples of 13 or 20 days, which are elementary periods of the Mesoamerican calendrical system, and considering independent contextual evidence, including ethnographic data, it has been argued that the solar orientations allowed the use of easily manageable observational calendars intended to facilitate prediction of ritually important dates in the seasonal cycle (Šprajc 2017).
Many important buildings are aligned both astronomically and to a prominent horizon feature, suggesting that the places for their construction were carefully selected. Supporting this conclusion is the fact that, observing from the main temple of an ancient settlement, prominent mountaintops on the local horizon often mark directions to sunrises or sunsets on significant dates, frequently recorded by architectural orientations. Given the results of statistical analyses (González-García and Šprajc 2016), it is utterly unlikely that the calendrically significant intervals separating the dates recorded by the most prominent orientation groups were produced by chance. It is thus hardly coincidental that, at several sites, prominent mountains also mark the Sun’s positions on the same dates. Since the intervals were clearly important, the alignments must have recorded them accurately; this is confirmed by architectural orientations, whenever they can be measured with sufficient precision, and can also be assumed



136
for mountaintops that were selected as natural markers. Since the alignments to horizon features can be established with much greater accuracy than most of architectural orientations, the corresponding declinations can also be determined quite accurately. In the case of the Sun, however, the declinations and dates matching an alignment depend on which position of the solar disk relative to the horizon was observed; due to the effects of general precession, the period of the alignment use must also be considered. In order to find out whether the Sun’s center or its upper or lower limb on the horizon was observed, and to disclose possible time-dependent trends in observational techniques, I have calculated the declinations corresponding to different Sun’s positions over prominent mountain peaks visible from a number of sites, and verified which values produce the most accurate intervals.
In a former study (Šprajc 2001) I hypothesized that, during the Preclassic period in central Mexico, the position of the upper limb on the horizon and along the alignment was relevant for determining the corresponding date, whereas during the Postclassic the observation of the whole orb on the horizon became a predominant practice. This hypothesis has now been reinforced with more comprehensive analyses: the intervals derived from different Sun’s positions were calculated much more precisely, based on reliable ephemeris data for archaeologically indicated periods in the past. After explaining the methodology, including computing procedures, I will present specific cases to show that the most accurate intervals composing the observational calendar reconstructed for a site could be achieved only if the dates corresponding to both architectural orientations and the alignments to horizon prominences were determined by consistently employing a particular observational technique. Based on these findings, more confident proposals can be made regarding specific topographic features that, by being used as horizon markers, conditioned



137
the location of several important buildings. It will also be shown that time-dependent and regional variations in observational techniques may have been related to the characteristics of architecture and different uses of construction elements. Consequently, the results of this study have obvious implications for understanding the criteria operating in Mesoamerican architectural design and urban planning.

Calender house at Copan? Orientation of structures in the Sepulturas region
Hasso Hohmann
Technische Universität Graz, Austria
Copan is one of the most important Late Classic Maya centres, situated in Honduras near the border to Guatemala. Courtyard A of the Courtyard Group 9N-8 in the so called Sepulturas Region is part of a domestic zone about 1 km east of the cultural centre. The “House of the Scribe” was the most important building and decorated with plenty of sculptures on all facades and rich reliefs inside. It had a corbelled vault, a flat roof and was situated in the south of Courtyard A. In the North on the opposite side are the remains of the courtyardtemple Structure STR 9N-80. A ball player possibly once lived in Structure STR 9N-81 on the western side. If the ball was used ceremonially it became a symbol for the sun. The structure had stone walls and a thatched roof. Structure STR 9N-83 in the East is a building with a domestic function and five rooms. It had a flat beam and mortar roof. In its western façade it has remains of a long row of small holes but three entrances interrupt this line.
Alignments
Careful measurements with geodetic instruments revealed that there are three really amazing phenomena at the two Structures 9N-81 and 9N-83 in the West and in the East of Courtyard A. Parallelism is extremely rare in Maya settlements. The same is true for Axiality between two structures and structure alignments pointing exactly to
the Cardinal Alignments.
1. The two platforms and the structures on top run parallel. Usually only ball courts consist of two parallel structures. But a ball court forms a special building unit.



139
2. The two Structures STR 9N-81 and STR 9N-83 each have an axis of symmetry. One axis joins the other. There is one common axis of symmetry and this is oriented exactly from East to West. Even the earliest Structures STR 9N-81SUB and STR 9N-83SUB were already parallel and had one identical axis running from East to West. This is extremely rare in Maya settlement patterns.
3. In 1985 the author and Robert Kostka carried out a sun measurement with an adapted theodolite from the Institute for Geodesy and Photogrammetry of the University of Technology in Graz. It turned out that each of the stairs, which lead up to the two Structures STR 9N-81 and STR 9N-83, runs exactly in the direction of True North.
Calendar House?
All these phenomena lead to the question as to why the Maya gave these two structures alignments to True North, to East, West and South? The scribe also had to document all facts relating to astronomy. The ball player house next to the “House of the Scribe” relates to the sun. The long row of holes in the façade of Structure STR 9N-83 is without any visible function. All these astronomical indications lead the author to the question of whether Structure STR 9N-83 with the row of holes was once a calendar house? This will be discussed.

Harmonic Cycles and Symmetric Time Structures in Mesoamerican Architecture
Carlos Eduardo Barrera Atuesta
Independent Researcher on Science in Maya Culture, Barcelona, Spain
GOALS:
Construction of symmetric time structures based on dates obtained from field studies about Mesoamerican astronomical orientations.
METHODS:
Division of time into 65-day structures centered on the winter and summer solstices, identification of dates within the structures, and mathematical analysis applied to the resulting intervals between dates.
MATERIAL STUDIES:
Field records and theoretical studies based on Mesoamerican architectural orientations.
DISCUSSION:
Previous field studies conclude that diverse Mesoamerican architectural structures are oriented towards specific points of the horizon where the sun rises or sets in dates that tend to be separated from each other by intervals of 13 or 20 days.
These intervals represent the two main factors of the 260-day Mesoamerican ritual calendar and could be coordinated with their idealized 365-day solar calendar to predict different significant dates of their active agricultural cycle comprised between the months of February and October.
This method, however, accumulates almost a day of error with respect to the tropical year after the fourth 365-day period, which ends up translating into 31 days of deviation after 128 repetitions. Therefore, its use would only be reliable within a limited four-year range.



141
The above conclusion partly (or totally) based on our modern conception of Science, seems to contradict the archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence according to which the ancient Maya easily performed huge computations of time and scheduled their ritual ceremonies for the same specific solar dates.
For this reason, some authors have proposed the existence of an ancient method still unknown to maintain the calendar in accordance with the solar year. Various hypotheses have tried to explain how this synchrony could have been achieved but, again, resorting to modern methods based on the use of "leap years" or "intercalary days" that do not necessarily reflect the way in which the ancient Mesoamericans conceived time.
How to reconcile then two or more Mesoamerican calendars based on integer numbers of days with an astronomical calendar based on solar cycles that averaged 365.242275 days in the Classic Maya Period (250-900 CE)?
The study of ancient Maya codices that record time structures constituted by 65-day intervals has allowed to develop a promising solution to the problem of synchrony between ritual and solar cycles, respecting the intergrity, continuity and immutability of recognized Maya intervals that are multiples of 116, 117, 260, 360, 364, 365, 520, 584, 585, 780 and 819 days, but also harmonizing and integrating the main solution models proposed so far to solve this issue.
The attached figure, selected from a set of studies carried out by the author for Chichen Itza (and other archaeological sites), illustrates symmetric structures of time integrated by harmonic intervals that exactly match (or fully comply with) the dates and margins of error determined by field measurements made by Šprajc and other researchers.



142
These intervals are a function of the Mesoamerican ritual calendar, as well as of multiple canonical and astronomical cycles that propagate in time the same agricultural solar dates established by different interpretive models.



143
CONCLUSION:
The dates obtained in field studies about Maya architectural orientations constitute symmetric time structures and could be predicted theoretically using synchronous Maya cycles.

Tolupan universe: A mesoamerican cosmovision
J. Mejuto and E. Rodas
Archaeoastronomy and Cultural Astronomy Department. Space Sciences Faculty. Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Honduras, Honduras – C.A.
Tolupan is one of the Central and Latin American most threatened peo
ples, from the cultural and human rights point of view. At the moment,
Tolupan culture counts on 20,000 members located in La Montaña de la
Flor, in the border of Yoro and Francisco Morazán departments in Hon
duras. Less than 5% of these members speak Tol, their original language,
which is in critical danger of disappearing (Moseley, 2010). The analysis
of this language has made it possible to locate this people as one of the
oldest in Central America, setting its ancestors in North America about
5,000 years ago. Scientific cultural studies for this people are very scarce and based mostly on the point of view of very few researchers who worked on site in the decade of 50s of the 20th century (Chap
man, 1982). Tolupan are nowadays in a clear process of acculturation but
there still remains a cosmovision with deep astronomical roots. By re
freshing and comparing the knowledge of the contemporary tolupan world view to the one their immediate ancestors had, it will serve as a diachronic study that will measure the acculturation process that this ethnic group has suffered in relation to time.
The study presented here explores the Tolupan astronomical and cultural heritage through mainly ethnographic, anthropological and lin
guistic approaches. The study of Tol language words and interviews with
members of the Tolupan community have revealed a structural complex
ity within its cosmogony and cosmovision that permeates the social struc
tures of the Tolupan culture. Thus, structural Anthropology is also used to analyse Tolupan cosmogony in order to identify the most relevant



145
astronomical events that could have shaped their believes framework.
Figure 1. Moment of the Lunar Eclipse tolupan ritual (Taken from "Los Hijos de Toman" documentary, SEDINAFROH, 2013)
Astronomical concepts such as Zenith, Nadir, East and West are very
present in tolupan tradition and shape a world where the creation of the human beings, the explanation of atmospheric and seismic phenomena, the creation of Sun and Moon are included and explained by the way in which the Tolupan people see the world through the celestial space. The eclipses of moon and sun are especially relevant, related to events in the lives of women and men respectively and associated with specific rituals (figure 1) in which the whole community participates and interacts with these celestial bodies, their movement in the celestial vault and the order of the universe. It is also highly interesting and infrequent -for a traditional cosmovision- the explanation of the existence of meteorites, which indicates that during its history as a people they have witnessed events of some importance relating to the fall from the sky of this type of objects.



146
The conclusions that emerged from this study are intended to be used as the initial steps towards the search of transcultural common grounds with other mesoamerican contemporary peoples and others from the past. They could also serve as the foundations of future ethnoastronomical works in the mesoamerican cultural area, traditionally studied from a purely archaeoastronomical point of view, based on the major cultures that were located in this region, such as the mayas and aztecs. Thus, recovering this astronomical tradition, carried out for several millennia, will provide other perspectives as to how the inhabitants of this cultural region developed the cultural aspects that we see today in modern tolupan population.

The astrological cycle of Schifanoia: the complexity of content through digital representation
Manuela Incerti, Stefania Iurilli
University of Ferrara, Italy
1- Short description of the object of study
The present paper illustrates the results of the research conducted on Palazzo Schifanoia, whose construction began in 1385. The palace actually hosts the civic museum of the city of Ferrara. Given the importance of the building in the history of architecture and Renaissance art, it attracts every year an important tourist flow. In 1469/70 the famous cycle of Months Salone dei Mesi was made (Varese, 1989; Bertozzi, 1999, 2002; Settis and Ghiraldini, 2007). Two agreements, stipulated with the Museums of Ancient Art of Ferrara, supported the research project.
2- State of the art and main bibliographical references
The current trends see the transformation of museums from a place of heritage conservation into active subjects in the provision of an accessible culture to a mass audience, thanks to the use of technologies and new interaction paradigms. This phenomenon first concerned the scientific museums, among which we recall the Science Museum of London and the MUSE of Trento. The various forms of interactivity and immersion increasingly aim at the enjoyment and enhancement of the visit experience, and not only at education and research. The use of digital products, static or dynamic, is a central theme in the definition of these communication media (Caraceni, 2012; Gaiani, 2012; Addison et al., 2013; Torres et al., 2015).
3- Definition of the research methodologies.
The general program, in 4 phases, involved the creation of two models (intended as families of models, in a diachronic sense): the model of the whole building, and the Salon one. Each model summarizes the



148
data deriving from the previous survey and study work. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the information, the models are configured as multifunctional databases: the design of these "containers", and the organization of the content, constituted the central phase of the research project. A subsequent phase involved the interactive relationships between the elements, with the transformation of the models into a navigable and searchable VR product. Some tests related to the user experience have led to cycles of correction and improvement of products, to ensure the best experience to a heterogeneous audience.
4- Objectives pursued and achieved
The primary aim is to give access to a higher level of knowledge of the building, difficult to reach through traditional information, written or verbally narrated. In particular, in the product recently published, the high-detail model is interactive and navigable on touchscreen during the visit. It constitutes the basis for augmented reality content, able to encourage a revitalization of the museum reality of Ferrara in an actualized key. The experience, taken to a multisensory level, is expanded: this allows describing complex characteristics - the painted perspectives, for example - relatively quickly. The increase in involvement through the interactive experience lengthens the duration of the visit, enhancing the interest in the place and its history.

Diachronic evolution of the orientation of the early Christian and medieval churches of Rome

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the choice of azimuth of the axis of early Christian and medieval churches in Rome has changed over the centuries. A first phase of the survey consisted in compiling a list of all the churches still existing in Rome built between the beginning of the fourth century and the late thirteenth century. To this purpose, the classic Krautheimer study in its 1970 update (Krautheimer et al., 1970) and Ghizzi's text (1998) were used. Our research produced a total of 92 churches. Of these, geographic coordinates and azimuth were measured using satellite images from Google Earth. In cases where the original arrangement of the parts was not evident, checks were carried out from the plants reported in the literature concerning the specific church and inspections. From this analysis, two distinct distributions of the azimuth of the ancient churches of Rome are clearly distinguished: one with azimuth from 30° to 150°, the other from 210° to 360°. Furthermore, statistically significant peaks are observed around 90°, 120°, 240°, 270°, that is, in directions of evident astronomical significance, as the studies related to the churches of this period in other geographical contexts seem to indicate (see, for example Hoare & Sweete, 2000; Liritzis & Vassiliou, 2006; McCluskey, 2000). The existence of two populations with a substantially opposite orientation that is suggested by the statistics must find its justification in hypothesis based on other objective elements: the first that can be advanced is that of a paradigm shift with the passing of the centuries. Wishing to verify that this hypothesis has its foundation, the churches were analyzed by subdividing them by century of construction. From this analysis, it is clear that in



151
the construction of the oldest churches the most established tendency is to orient the axis with the entrance to the east and the apse to the west, even if the opposite orientation is noticeably frequent. In the following centuries there is a settling phase in which all the orientations have more or less the same importance. From the ninth century onwards the habit of orientating the buildings of worship with the apse to the east and the entrance to the west was definitively affirmed. This work will present the possible historical motivations of this temporal evolution.

Intellectual transformations during Renaissance The change of worldview - Impacts on the architectural thought and creation in the Czech lands during 16th and early 17th century.
Nikolaos Ragkos
Department of History, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic
The renaissance history of the Czech lands has been associated with some of the most important names of the science of astronomy like Rheticus, Tycho Brahe, and Johannes Kepler, who through their work during the 16th and beginning of 17th century laid the foundations of modern astronomy. The trigger for the development of their work was the publication of Nikolaus Copernicus work entitled «De revolutionibus orbium coelestium». This work was the formalization of multi annual considerations, of the astronomers of that time, on the existing interpretative theories for our planetary system. This concern on the well-established for many centuries Aristotelian philosophy and cosmology, it did not preoccupy only specific astronomers or intellectuals of the era. It was ascertained that there was a network spread all around Europe where all concerns and new publications on astronomy were discussed.
These efforts were supported and funded most of the times by the noblemen and kings, likewise in the Bohemia region. The first where the emerging social order who framed and supported the kings and started attending the universities, as habitually did the latter. Within the universities the spirit of independent research and desire for further progress was already diffuse, where humanistic thought prevailed finally over scholasticism. The science in which this change was mostly reflected, was astronomy.
At the same time the nobility and Kings financed the construction of significant architectural projects. Renaissance architecture was



153
influenced by the general interest in the study, interpretation and revival of spiritual and artistic heritage of Greek and Roman antiquity. During 16th century in Bohemia region the local architecture was usually associated with the Renaissance style.
The buildings which more reflect this influence are the aristocratic luxurious residences called ‘chateau’. It was a completely new type of buildings which appeared in the Czech lands that time. Unlike manor houses, their layouts have a considerably greater range, reaching from a rectangular cubic construction, which may be enriched with corner towers or bay windows, through an angular layout in the shape of a letter ‘L’ to a closed four-wing layout, usually with a tower above the entrance, or a ‘castellum’ with cylindrical or polygonal towers in the corners.
Did the evolution of astronomy during this historical period have an impact on the architecture of the Bohemian region and more specifically on the aforementioned secular type of buildings? The answer to this question is sought through the investigation of the astronomical orientation of the chateau’s, as most of them where usually built in free open space surrounded by landscaped gardens. As it is visible from the diagram below the majority of the chateau’s seem to be cardinally orientated, while a second densification occurs around the vernal equinox point - the diagram highlights the east-west axis of the buildings. Along with these ascertainments, research is being carried out into whether additional architectural features of these castles, such as openings and corner towers, imply the knowledge and practice of the science of astronomy.
The list of castles included on the diagram below was compiled according to the list available on the book: "Ilustrovaná Encyklopedie Českých Zamků" - Illustrated Encyclopedia of Czech castles.

The orientation of Roman centuriations. Disposition of Christian medieval sacred buildings inside the Roman centuria situated in Northern Italy
Eva Spinazzè
University Ca’ Foscari Venice, IUAV Venice, Italy and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland
Studying the disposition of a sacred building, first of all, the morphology of the area on which the architecture is placed must be examined as well as the local horizon profile: relief, ancient roads, centuriations and/or rivers crossing the territory, as they could have influenced the orientation of a Christian building. After considering how the setting is formed, the Roman road system and the medieval church alignments (major axis and windows) were measured by GPS ground surveys, then cross-referenced with Early Christian and medieval liturgical and astronomical sources as well as scholarly literature. Thus, sure data come from these georeferenced topographic surveys on field, carried out on still existing traces of centuriations and on the medieval sacred buildings, being so strengthened by sources.
Nowadays, in several Italian cities and in the countryside some Roman centuriations are well visible and can be measured. This permits to get their azimuth and to compare the results with one another. We will discuss the orientation of some Roman centuriations in Northern Italy (Aquileia, Sesto al Reghena, Roman Graticolato of Padova, Verona, Lucca, Piacenza) and the disposition of some Christian sacred buildings of Middle Ages erected inside their Roman centuria. Roughly can be said that medieval churches founded in a Roman city sometimes follow the direction of the decumanus. But focusing deeper on the analyzes, it is evident that in most cases there are substantial differences between the two azimuths (decumanus and axes of the building): often the decumanus shows an alignment to an astronomical date or Roman calendar, while the church axis indicates an



156
alignment with the rising or setting of the Sun or Moon on a Christian feast.
Frequently the centuriations were oriented by observing the cyclicity of the stars as evidenced by the treatises of the Roman land surveyors (Hygini Gromatici, Constitutio limitum, 21-22. Frontin, De limitibus, 3.12. Les arpenteurs romains, Hygin le gromatique, Frontin 2005) and by the results of the topographic surveys carried out on still existing Roman road traces. The foundation rites of a Roman town with the choice of the site incorporated a deep political and religious meaning. A significant example can be seen in Verona, whose decumanus is orientated towards the Sunrise during the summer solstice, or in Lucca, where the ancient tracing corresponded to the Sunrise in the middle of March, which represented the beginning of the Roman year. The case of Aquileia, the angular values of its centuriation led approximately to the points where the Sun rose in early May and mid-August in the 2nd century BC: we are close to April 21st, the day of Natalis Romae, that is the anniversary of the foundation of Rome. Instead, the
analysed churches built inside a centuria show an alignment with the

sunrise or sunset on the horizon mainly on the Patron Saint’s feast to whom the church was dedicated or on one of the four Virgin’s medieval feasts, i.e: the Annunciation (25th March); Purification (2nd February); Assumption (18th January, 15th August) and Nativity (8th September). We always find the same days, as can be seen in other studies carried out by the author on over two hundred medieval churches. This shows that in the Middle Ages the ancient custom of scanning the rising/setting of a celestial body was taken over by the Christians and adapted to their requirements, namely to their religion, as the Sun was associated to Jesus Christ and the Moon to the Blessed Virgin.

Harmony and symmetry: The Planetarium Babylonicum of MUL.APIN
Susanne M Hoffmann, Manfred Krebernik
Friedrich-Schiller-Universität, Jena, Germany
It is popularly known that our (Greek) constellations root in several more ancient cultures. Especially in the zodiac the Babylonian roots are obvious. There are many speculations about the Babylonian sky, most recently the book by White1. Aiming on visualizations of the Babylonian sky our collaboration of assyriologists, astronomers, and planetarium people modelled a Babylonian celestial globe based on the information in MUL.APIN. We plot and connect the data, reconstruct many of the Babylonian constellations and localize them accurately, and so anew the understanding of transfer from Babylonian to Greek culture.
The problem is, that the identifications of Akkadian words with stars and constellations about one hundred years old and needs to be revised. Our material for this study is basically the reconstruction of the text of MUL.APIN by Hunger and Pingree3,4. The method is to read this text again line by line and in its context and to gather all information on it which is currently available (from modern encyclopedia5)-inboth,philologicalaswellashistoriographicalstudies-andevaluatethe astronomical information computationally. Having evaluated the first tablet of MUL.APIN, we present visualizing the constellations and modelling a Babylonian globe.

Ziggurats of Mesopotamia: An Astro-Archaeological Analysis
Vance Tiede
Astro-Archaeology Surveys, Guilford, CT, USA
Background.
Over the last century, scholars have deciphered cuneiform texts on mathematics and astronomy (Neugebauer & Sachs 1955) associated with Mesopotamia’s religious architecture, calendars and iconography (Curatorla 2007). However, no systematic investigation of possible astronomical orientation has been made of Mesopotamia’s many ziggurats and temples. The availability of geo-referenced/sub



160
meter resolution satellite imagery now makes such analysis feasible;



161
despite the region’s ongoing military conflicts pre analysis feasible, despite the region’s ongoing military conflicts preventing Ground Truth field survey.
Research Objective.
To determine if Mesopotamian temples and ziggurats were oriented to rise/set points on the local horizon of astronomical bodies with the greatest religious significance (cf. Hawkins 1968), viz.: Sun (Shamash), Moon (Sin-Nanna) and Venus (Ishtar).
Methodology.
Published site plans (Heinrich 1982, 1984) and Google Earth satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model were analysed to derive horizon declinations for architectural orientations from Program Stonehenge (Hawkins 1983). Natural and artificial (e.g., ziggurat stairway top viewed from stairway base) horizon declinations were matched to possible astronomical alignments modelled in Starry Night Pro Plus 6 digital planetariums (Figure 1).
The dimensions and observing vectors of Mesopotamian temples and ziggurats were also analysed for “numerical artefacts” preserved in the architecture, e.g., integer historical units of measurement and Pythagorean triples.
Discussion.
The preliminary findings regarding astro-orientation in Table 1 are not only consistent with luni-solar rise/set positions mentioned in Mesopotamian texts (Neugebauer 1957, 97-119), but also lunar standstills (cf. Hawkins 1967; Schaeffer 1994, 2007) and possibly even Venus zenith passage at absolute maximum declination (cf. Langdon & Fotheringham 1928).
Conclusion.
Remote sensing positive findings warrant future Ground Truth confirmation. Meanwhile, expanding the sample size with remote



162
sensing techniques may deepen our understanding of the origins and contributions astronomy to our common cultural heritage

A Cultural Comparison of Dark Sky Constellations
Steven R. Gullberg, Andrew M. Munro
University of Oklahoma, USA
Many civilizations have been fascinated with the Milky Way. The striking appearance of our galaxy in the night sky captivated them and imagined images became part of certain cosmologies. This will be examined, with an emphasis on two prominent cultures of the Southern Hemisphere that have embraced dark sky constellations, that of the Aborigines of Australia and the Incas of Peru. Aspects of astronomy in the two cultures will be compared, with a focus upon the dark sky constellations seen in the Milky Way.
The Milky Way provided visual inspiration for several themes of Inca cosmology. Andeans recognized several dark constellations, the shapes of beings formed by dark clouds in the visible band of the galaxy. These dark spots, amidst the glow of the Milky Way, are formed by interstellar gas and dust blocking the light from the bright array of stars behind them. In them were seen great cosmological characters often meant to influence daily lives.
A dark constellation well-known by Australian aboriginal groups is the Emu in the Sky. A dark cloud in the Milky Way, presently known as the Coalsack, forms the head of the emu and its body and legs continue across the adjacent part of the galaxy. A rock art engraving in Kuringgai Chase National Park depicts a similar emu and the Emu in the Sky aligns above it during the season for emu egg-laying.
This paper explores the fascination with darkness in the Milky Way, and through comparisons looks at common themes and inspirations, as well as other similarities and differences. It examines like reasons why cultures saw what they did and embraced what they saw in these dark parts of the galaxy.

On the orientation of Roman cities in the Illyrian coast: a statistical and comparative study
Juan Antonio Belmonte1, Andrea Rodríguez Antón1, A. César González-García2
1. Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias & Universidad de Laguna, Tenerife, Spain 2 Instituto de Ciencias del Patrimonio, Incipit-CSIC, Santiago de Compost., Spain
In this contribution, we present an extension to a new geographic area of a wide and ambitious project for the study of the role of astronomy in Roman urban layout started a few years ago which has constituted the recently defended Ph.D Thesis of the second author (Rodríguez Antón, 2017; Rodríguez Antón et al. 2017-8). The interest in carrying out this project was motivated by the results extracted from previous studies on this topic that pointed towards the existence of orientation patterns potentially connected with astronomy (González-Garcia et al. 2014; González-García and Magli, 2015). The main aim is to check whether Roman cities present astronomical patterns in their orientations. The origin of this research lies in ideas about how to properly orientate the main streets of a town, something accounted by a number of ancient writers. In particular, we mainly focus on the guidelines given by Hyginus Gromaticus (Constitutio, 1) and Frontinus (De Agrimensura, 27), who stated that the decumanus (one of the two main streets of a Roman city) should follow the path of the sun. On this occasion, new data of ten cities of the Croatian Adriatic region are presented, from Parentium in Istria to Narona in Dalmatia (see Figure 1).



166
Figure 1. Roman cities of the Croatian Adriatic coast measured in a fieldwork campaign in the summer of 2016.
The data ranges from old Illyrian cities reorganized in Roman times, such as Nesactium or Salona, to new Republican or Imperial foundations such as the cities of Parentium (Poreç) or Aspalathos (Split). The data is analyzed both as a group and individually. By this analysis, we pretend to extract significant evidences that sustained the astronomical argument and shed more light on Roman ideas about urbanism. The results, that consider settlements whose building spanned an extended period of time, are not consistent with a random distribution. Actually, orientation patterns do arise when a certain group of monuments (main temples) r cities is focused, pointing towards a presumably planning according to particular directions within the local land and skyscape (e.g. Equinox sunrise). However, in a few particular cases, such as Salona or Iader, previous pre-Roman urbanism or local



167
topography, respectively, may also influence the orientation observed and precludes any firm conclusion in this respect. Besides, in order to check whether those ancient criteria were really fulfilled, and also to reinforce the idea of a likely relationship between Roman city planning and the sky, we have made a comparative analysis with the results obtained in other regions of the Roman Empire (see e.g. Rodríguez-Antón et al. 2016). This highlights the integration of important dates of the Roman or pre-Roman calendar into urbanism and, especially, they stress the necessity to further reinforce this kind of studies in other provinces of the Empire in order to elucidate what is behind those patterns in the different regions, including Illyria. That is, if beliefs or even political ideology were embodied within city plans in the region.

The summer solstice Sun in Lepenski Vir
Aleksandra Bajić, Hristivoje Pavlović
Society for research in Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy "Vlašići", Belgrade, Serbia
Lepenski vir is a prehistoric settlement from the Mesolithic period, situated on the right bank of the Danube in the Iron Gate Gorge. It flourished by the end of the seventh millennium BC.
The place was discovered in 1965, in 1972 it was moved about 100 m northwest from the original position, in order to avoid the submersion by the Danube, after the construction of the dam at Kladovo.
-An interesting phenomenon of the double sunrise (only) in the dawn of summer solstice can be observed from the new position of the settlement. The first sunrays appear in a narrow notch on the horizon. Then the Sun “climbs” along the northern slope of the Treskavac hill for a short time, and then it hides itself behind the northern part of the flattened top.
Four minutes later, it rises again at the top. Thus, thanks to the struc
ture of the natural horizon, one can accurately determine the summer

solstice day in a year, which is the starting point for determining a sort of solar calendar.
Knowing that 8200 years ago, the Earth's axis was significantly more inclined in respect to the ecliptic than it is inclined today, and the summer solstice Sun rose more than 1o closer to the North, the phenomenon of the double sunrise could be observed from a certain position located southwise (or lower) than it is today, which leads right in the direction of the original position of the Mesolithic settlement.
This work is an attempt to demonstrate that the phenomenon of double summer solstice sunrise was observed from the northern part of the Mesolithic settlement (or from its close vicinity) 8200 years ago, and that members of this culture were able to create some sort of solar calendar. Although the original location of the settlement is submerged, there is precise technical documentation on its relocation. This documentation, together with the achievements of modern astrogeodesy and accurate geospatial positioning, enables archaeoastronomical analysis of this site. The declination of the Sun on the summer solstice is equal to the inclination of the Earth's axis and can be calculated according to the Lascar’s formula. Accurate geographic coordinates together with the elevation of the points of interest on the site, can be reconstructed according to the existing technical documentation. It is possible to draw the net of geographical WGS/UTM coordinates on the map of relocation after the accurate GPS positioning of the centre of the relocated settlement. The angular height of the horizon can be measured, and geographical North determined by astrogeodetic survey from certain points on the present-day bank of the Danube. The data thus obtained will enable geodetical and astronomical calculations.
This analysis will show that the position of the settlement was deliberately chosen, and that the position of village was precisely measured and conceived, in accordance with the observed astronomical



170
event, the summer solstice sunrise on the flattened top of the Treskavac hill. From the northernmost part of the settlement, the observer was able to see the double summer solstice sunrise. From the southernmost building in the settlement (the house No. 65), the observer was able to see the summer solstice Sun rising at the southernmost point of the flattened top of the same hill.
Treskavac is a volcanic rock and the most prominent structure on the eastern horizon. The event is very impressive, and the game of light and shadows reaches the level of hierophany.

"Harmonices Mundi" by Johannes Kepler and
Georg Kraft’s prediction for ice drift on the Neva
River in 1732.
Karine Dilanian
Institute for the Study of Cosmology and Astronomy in History, Philosophy and Culture, Moscow, Russia
Johannes Kepler was once a school teacher in Graz, where this SEAC conference is taking place.
This paper will explore an application of Kepler’s meteorological astrology in 1732.
On July 20, 1732, the Primechaniya Na Sankt-Peterburgskiye Vedomosti magazine published an article ‘About the St. Petersburg Calendar of This 1732’1. The author of the article says that as the storyteller of this calendar undertakes an attempt to make a prediction and promises his readers that he will answer a question in public: “When will the ice on the Neva River start to drift this year”. The author states that he will explain how he made this prediction, with two purposes: first, to reveal it by means of heavenly aspects, and secondly for some entertainment. And though the second purpose can seem frivolous, however it gives him a chance to make a message about astrology in general. In addition, he expects assistance from "glorious Kepler". Although the article was not signed, however Pyotr Pekarsky (1828 - 1872) in his "History of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg" claims that the author was the academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the physicist and the mathematician Georg Wolfgang Kraft (1701 - 1754), from Wurtemberg2. In the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences Kraft worked under the leadership of the astronomer Joseph-Nicolas De L'Isle (1688 - 1768), the convinced follower of Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton. Nina Nevskaya states that in the course of preparation of the fellow-astronomers for the



172
observatory in Saint Petersburg, De L'Isle had compiled a list of 405 books, recommended for studying for every fellow of the observatory, among which there were about 20 works of Johannes Kepler3. Being an astronomer, De l’Isle also had a title of "the court astrologer" which he had passed to Kraft later4
Kraft starts his article with critical remarks of rather deplorable condition of astrology in his time and explains the reason of such condition; however, in order to support the validity of astrology, he suggests special method for prognostications based on Kepler’s understanding of the power of aspects that are geometrical ratios between planets. His explanation concerning the general basis of astrology contains a reasoning concerning consonances that are born in a human soul from the heavenly harmony based on geometry, on an order and on an appropriate proportion. Kraft continues his explanation, assimilating musical octave to geometrical proportions, connected with planetary aspects. He claims that all diseases, burdens or profits, circumstances of human life as well as his tendencies and abilities are defined with the help of astrological aspects. Then Kraft passes to meteorological prediction concerning opening of ice on the Neva River and explains in detail how on the basis of the careful analysis of aspects between planets, he has made a choice for a certain combination, which, according to him, led to ice opening on April 5, 1732.
This study examines Kraft’s method of meteorological prognostication and his statements concerning astrological models of planetary aspects connected with musical harmony and geometrical ratios and compares them to Kepler’s principles presented in his works: Harmonices Mundi and Concerning the more certain fundamentals of astrology. The methodology of this research is based on the comparative approach to the study of the historical and literature documents that are archival sources and philosophical literary work in order to investigate the general concepts, to analyze their interrelations, to



173
find similarities and differences as well as establishing of dialogic relations with other texts and contexts.

The Gregorian calendar in Austria and Johannes Kepler
Harald Gropp
Universität Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany
Johannes Kepler left Tübingen on Wednesday, March 13, 1594 and arrived in Graz on April 11, on easter Monday. It took him 19 days, however, not 29 days, as the dates may suggest. In Graz the Gregorian calendar was introduced in October 1583 by leaving out 10 days, one year too late concerning the Papal Bull but earlier than in other parts of the Reich. Kepler came from Protestant Württemberg to Catholic Habsburg. However, ideas of the reformation had entered parts of Austria, in particular Styria and its capital Graz. In particular, Kepler entered the protestant school in Graz as a "Landschaftsmathematiker". In contrast, the Jesuits had founded a school in Graz which developed into the university of Graz in 1585. While on the one hand not all of Austria stayed Catholic in those days, Kepler as a protestant scholar was quite in favour of the (Catholic) gregorian calendar.
These years of Kepler between 1594 and 1600 in Graz when he had finally to leave the town are taken as a starting point to investigate in more detail when and how the Gregorian calendar was introduced in different parts of Austria and other Catholic regions of Europe, how the existence of two calendars and quite often different Easter dates influenced the confessionally divided regions. Moreover, the acceptance or nonacceptance of the Gregorian calendar by protestant scholars will be discussed, Johann Kepler just being one example. Furthermore, the question will be addressed how much the confessionally divided population of Graz blocked or stimulated the scientific and theological discussions about calendar questions but also about other astronomical and astrological topics of interest.



175
Johannes Kepler himself was engaged in the calendar discussion, compare his "Kalendertisch" or his work "Dialogus de Calendario Gregoriano". Another aspect of interest is the question how much the Ottomans or Turks are involved in these scientific and theological discussions, as enemies in the military and/or the religious field as well as scholarly partners.
Graz was the center of "Innerösterreich", a region including the today’s Steiermark, Kärnten, parts of Slovenia and Italy. It, played a prominent role in the propagation of reformational ideas and of the final counterreformational victory in the region, also in connection with the beginning of the Slovenian "language building".
When Kepler left Graz on September 30, 1600 neither the calendar discussion in Europe nor the easter date debate had approached a solution. It needed 100 years until most protestant countries in Europe introduced their corrected calendar, nearly 200 years for a common Easter date in Western Europe, and still today the discussion "Towards one date" is going on, probably leading to thesituationwherein2019weshallthreeeasterdates, the"realastronomical" one, theWestern one and theEastern orthodox one.
Harmony, symmetry and regularity are challenging aspects of nature which enabledmankindtostudytheirproperties.Certainly,Johannes Keplerwas one of the most influential scholars in this aspect, from the point of view of science but also from the point of view of religion and theology. It is probably in his six years in Linz where these aspects can be studied best.

Astronomical Treasures in Stift Rein
Sonja Draxler and Max E. Lippitsch
Karl-Franzens University Graz, Austria
Stift Rein, situated in the north of Graz, is the oldest existing Cisterian Monastery in the world, founded in 1129. Monks lived and worked here without interruption for nearly 900 years. In the Great Scriptorium of Rein they wrote and copied manuscripts, and even today the library holds numerous valuable manuscripts and books. This lecture gives a brief overview of the most important manuscripts and books with astronomical content. A few examples will be mentioned in the abstract.
The oldest manuscript with astronomical content is CodRun 21, a codex from the Great Scriptorium, dated to the 12th century. The main content is about music and history, but on 185r a short text in hexamters is inserted, titeled Motus astorum and dealing with the constelations. It was used as a mnemoic for names and sequence of the most important constellations. This proves that astronomy was studied in Rein from its early times
Another manuscript with astronomical content is the Wurmprecht calendar, CodRun 204 from 1373. It is a calendar with astronomical and religious information, as well as pictures of constellations, diagrams to calculate the Easter Date or dates of some solar and lunar eclipses. This is the oldest calendar in German language.
A fascinating manuscript is CodRun124, a hand-drawn partial copy of Peter Apian’s Astronomicum Caesareum, one of the most magnificent books on astronomy ever published1. It contains astronomical drawings and moveable parts of high quality (Figure 1). The book starts with a star map, followed by volvelles to determine the position of sun, moon and planets, and to calculate conjunction and opposition of sun and moon or solar and lunar eclipses. Most of the drawings are



177
coloured, and the volvelles are fully functional with up to six moveable disks. This hand-written Rein copy, however, has no text or explanation in the whole volume. Nothing is known abot the creator of this copv of Apian’s famours work.
Figure 1: Apian, Astronomicum Caesareum, volvelle on lunar eklipses
CodRun125 is a hand-made ink-drawing of the orbit of the Great Comet of 1577. The creator of the drawing is not known, but the original is attributed to Paul Fabricius from Vienna. It was this comet that for the first time infected Johannes Kepler with the fascination



178
ofAstronomy, when his mother took the 6-year old boy to a nearby hill to observe the heavenly spectaculum.
One book is of interest not only because of its content, but even more due to the owner. A printed version of Sacrobosco’s well-known “De sphaera” belonged to archduke Ferdinand, lateron emperor Ferdinand II. He was the ruler, who expelled Johannes Kepler from Graz and led Europe into the Thirty Years War. The Sacrbosco was part of his student’s library during his studies at the University of Ingolstadt. That astronomy was not in the focvs of his intellectual capabilities is proven by the book: the pages do not exhibit any traces of use by its owner.
Besides so many interesting books a big calendar table2 (Figure 2) is on display. This round stone table with a diameter of 137 cm contains two calendars, the Julian and the Gregorian one. Each one is for the years 1600 to 1800, covering therefore the range of 200 years, and giving data for 73 000 days. Creator of this sophisticated work was Andreas Pleninger3,4 (or Plieninger) in 1607, an organist and stone etcher from Regensburg.



179
A lot of further astronomical and religious information can be found on the table. In the centre there is an armillary sphere surrounded by coloured pictures of the gods of the day. For each day, information is provifrf on sunrise snf length of the day. Pictures illstrate the zodiacal signs and work of the month and are followed by the length of the months. Going from the centre outwards there is an eternal calendar for the 365 days (Fig. 2) of the year. Information is given on rising or setting of special stars, letters of the day and saints of the day. This circle is followed by a circle of holes, used to span a thread to the centre to mark the information for a special day. Beyond the holes run the two calendars, the Julian and the Gregoria, for the years 1600 to 1800. In both calendars all major Christian holidays can be found.

Round table: The Ontological Turn in Anthropology and Archaeology and Its Importance for Cultural Astronomy

The session has as its goal a critical exploration of how the conceptual framework impulsed by the debate around the notion of relational ontologies can be brought to bear on research being carried out in Cultural Astronomy. This new relational framework has given strength to an ontological turn that has been taking place in anthropological and archaeological circles over the past twenty years, impacting both theory and practice. It can be expressed in two ways. One way is to recognise that other societies, past and present, live in different worlds, that a key element in understanding those societies is reconstructing their ontology, and that this, therefore, should be a key aim of research. Another avenue is to recognise the ontological turn as a theoretical “bomb" that demands a new take on one’s own discipline and a more reflexive attitude concerning one’s own core beliefs—a conceptual reorientation not seen since the postmodernist turn. As Alberti put it (2016, 174): “the difference between the two [expressions of the ontological turn] lies in the degree to which an approach is willing to do ontology to itself, how much critique it is willing to direct at its own ontological assumptions.” The panel participants will, therefore, also discuss this aspect of the turn and



181
highlight theoretical tools and methods already proposed to tackle singular instances of this phenomenon.
In addition, they will discuss how this "ontological turn" might be integrated into the toolkit by researchers when dealing with topics in Cultural Astronomy. This will be done by taking into account the prepositions that are truly innovative as well as those aspects that simply represent changes of name or emphasis, and finally the possible limitations of the theoretical framework itself.
The aim of this session is to bring to the attention of researchers in archaeoastronomy and ethnoastronomy the ontological interplay between humans, landscape features, astronomical and meteorological phenomena, animals, plants, things and spirits within particular environments. Ontologies that involve animism, personhood and nonhuman agency challenge the traditional views of Cultural Astronomy and provide rich resources for bold new interpretations.
The proposed 90-minute session begins with introductory comments by the panel moderator, followed by a set of brief statements by each panel member which will highlight different aspects of the topic. Their commentary, in turn, will serve to orient the round-table discussion that will take place during the second half of the session.
Familiarization with the conceptual reorientation implied by these ontologies is important not only for those concerned with the realm of indigenous cosmology, but also for researchers working on European materials. In short, these are issues that cannot be ignored by archaeo- and ethnoastronomers who aspire to be current with developments in anthropology and archaeology.

Archaeoastronomical investigation of Felix Romuliana
Aleksandra Bajić and Milan S. Dimitrijević
Society for research in Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy "Vlašići", Belgrade, Serbia
Astronomical Observatory, Belgrade, Serbia
Felix Romuliana [1] is one of the last examples of roman monumental architecture, in clear connection with classical roman polytheism. It consists of a fortification in which there is a residential complex, two sanctuaries, thermae and a barn, as well as of a sacral-funeral complex on the adjacent hill Magura, about 1 km east of the fortification, where there are two large tumulus and two mausoleums. Archaeologists believe that the remains of the Emperor Gallery (Galerius Valerius Maximinus Augustus) and his mother Romula were buried there. In addition to these buildings, on the road leading to Magura there are remains of the crossroad, where the road to the residential complex has crossed the road to Magura. Tetrapilon was built at the intersection. Hundred meters south of Tetrapilon are the remains of a large rectangular structure, which was only examined by sondage. It was found that it was richly decorated with a plurality of mosaic cubes, many of which are gilded, which points to the importance of the building.
It is known that the Romans conceived their settlements according to cardinal directions and, that Cardo and Decumanus had a very important place in Roman architecture. It is also known that they determined their holidays according to astronomical events (risings and sunsets of the Sun and the stars), as Ovidius wrote in his work Fasti.
This paper is an attempt to find out which holidays were celebrated in Felix Romuliana and which deities were considered as the protectors of its inhabitants. Iconographic representations, in the form of sculptures, reliefs or mosaics, point to the celebration of Dionysus and



186
Ariadne, Jupiter, Hercules and Asclepius, and probably Demeter and Hekate. The assumption that their holidays were determined by observing the Sun and the stars has been checked (after geodetic recording of the horizon) by using RedShift 7 astronomical software. The observation points are determined according to the rules of Roman architecture. The interrelations between constructions of the sacral and funeral complex were investigated and several astronomically significant directions were found.
The Residential Complex of Felix Romuliana has one main east-west street, Decumanus Maximus, from the main east gate (Porta Pretoria) of the older fortification, to the western gate (Porta Decumana). There is no street in the direction of north-south, therefore missing Cardo Maximus, and he reason why the main geodetic point of the complex (Groma, Umbilicus) would be on the intersection of these streets. It is therefore assumed that this main point was located at the highest point of the residential complex, at the western gate of the older fortification (Porta Pretoria). After the astro-geodetic survey from that point, it was found that the northern basement of the smaller tumulus on the Magura is exactly in the geographical east, which is also verified on satellite maps (The assumed Groma and the northern basement of the smaller tumble have exactly the same latitude). A further analysis, using the Red Shift 7 astronomical software, showed that the buildings on the Magura are in fact precise landmarks on the horizon, which make it possible to determine the dates of important holidays, and that those holidays are fully correlated with iconographic representations, found on archaeological site. Thus, the assumed position



187
of the main geodetic point of the residential complex became much more probable.
Structures on the Magura (tumuluses) represent precise landmarks on the horizon for observers from the temples on the site (a smaller temple in the northern and higher in the southern part of the complex). Observing the sunrise from the temples, the main holidays could be determined, and they were the same ones that could be determined by observing from the Groma.
Locality is interesting for archaeoastronomical analysis for several reasons: the Roman ruler who built it was not of a Roman origin, his father was Tracanin and his mother Dacian. It turns out that local traditions also had an influence in the design of his memorial complex; Felix Romuliana is one of the last places in Europe where is possible to explore the relationship of astronomy with Roman polytheistic religion. Very soon after its construction, the new religion will carry out the radical desacralization of the heavens and the celestial bodies. The celestial body will no longer be Numina Divina, but will become ordinary nuggets of matter in the hands of the new, only god. Finally, archaeoastronomical analysis can help to define the order of construction of individual buildings in the complex.

Johannes Kepler started his working life in 1594 soon after his study at the protestant University of Tübingen at the Protestant School in Graz as professor of mathematics. Additionally his duty was to calculate and prepare for print the yearly calendar/almanac with its prognostics. His first major astronomical opus was the book “Mysterium Cosmographicum” published 1596 in Tübingen, spreading Kepler’s ideas about the structure of the solar system as a representation of the Platonic solids.
During his stay in Graz he also started a family by the marriage of the Styrian Barbara Müller in 1597. But already in September 1598 he had to leave the country awhile, were in August 1600 he was expelled from Styria due to the actions of the counter-reformation under archduke Ferdinand II of Styria.
His last astronomical activity in Graz was the observation and the taking of measurements of the solar eclipse on July 10, 1600. Therefore he constructed a measurement device and observed the partial eclipse with the use of a camera obscura.
The poster is also going to show and describe the different monuments and places commemorating Kepler and his activities during his stay in Graz, including the memorial plaque at the former Protestant School in the city, the memorial in the municipal park, the monument near the Kepler bridge across the local river Mur, the Kepler room at the Kepler High School, and the flour mill of his wfe’s family (Mühlegg /Mühleck) at Gössendorf near Graz

Sky as the cultural landscape
Jadran Kale
Dept. of Ethnology and Anthropology, University of Zadar, Zadar, Croatia
Sidereal delineations contradict the rest of human orientations in a wide variety of physical and abstract landscapes where cardinal directions are defined by a human body. Above the strictly regulated earth heavens could shock with kings beneath or behind commoners and animals in a forefront of heros or gods. Still, there are no democratic or biophilic aspirations in codifying night sky. Reasons for their arrangements are practical and can be followed from autarky to supranational agenda. South Slavic skylore with the data from The Ethnological Atlas of Yugoslavia (2500 localities from 1960's-1980's Zagreb project) will be the core of presentation and comparisons with historical sources and ethnoastronomical studies in an effort to depict cognitive rules for cultural harmonization of a random stellar patchwork.
Perpetual movement had sharply favored animals over plants, and among humans processions are dominant way of arranging complex orders. Another approach to celestial harmony has been granted by symmetries with narrative counterparts opposing each other, a pattern very well known since antiquity. The most complex arrangements were assigned with the winter night sky, convenient to observe appearances and disappearances and also to combine with landscape features during seasons of intensive fieldwork in autumn and spring. Onomastics could help us to decipher characteristics of eponymic communities, their economies and associated utilitarian and aesthetic senses.
Beside movement, figures of the night sky do not deny gravity like astronauts. Like humans, their movement is described as „walk“ through the sky, and they do it in a proper orientation regarding their observers. No figure is described as posing upside down. Commoner



191
may precede a dignitary, but with a reason of pursuit and ethernal punishment. Earthly order did not vaporize into thin nightly air, its theleology is self-evident until the last associated benign story or proverb being told.
Some sky formations are especially keen to carry such symbolics, as well as mere names as such. Lesser or faint stars could be important if they respond to a cultural pattern. Goal of this research was to analyse earthly foundations for sidereal cultural building. Cardinal directions were adapted to a different order of „up“ vs. „down“ or „front“ vs. „back“ etc., and directions became vectors with unique position of the north pole and associated star. Sky does not have a tellurian core or heart, but world surface can't compete with absolute orientation of the night sky. From such symbolic points heavens had returned back to the earth to assist hegemonies, protruding master's face over remote mountains to watch over and warn all over again.
Night sky is not the only cultural landscape that humans were not able to touch. Aside of taboos concerned with spaces forbidden to approach, there is also seafloor with a number of folk names from preindustrial era useful for fishermen and essential for maritime coral expeditions. It is possible to extrapolate certain common traits in human dealing with abstract space, with cognitive anthropology reaching for diverse ethnoastronomical knowledge for a number of years now. Here we shall propose a step towards understanding of culture of space, thickly weaved with human symbolic devices and procedures, with astronomy in culture as its foundation.

The case of the enclosure burials of Bonlez (Belgium): an archaeoastronomical analysis.
Heller frédéric, Silvia Motta, Adriano Gaspani

Bonlez, located in Wallonia, at the bottom of a valley, is a Middle Bronze Age site. Using the LIDAR surveying system, we obtained detailed high-resolution maps. Ultra-high resolution aerial lasing enables a new paradigm in global exploration. Aerial imagery, after relevant georeferencing and georectification, with its increasing resolution and precision, is becoming a useful toPerkinsol in many disciplines, among them in Archaeoastronomy and other studies of ancient civilizations; using satellite images is possible to measure astronomical orientations of structures and sites without visiting the places. In the site of Bonlez, LiDAR has yielded half a dozen MBA burials, including the “fossile directeur” one with enclosure, similar to the British and Dutch Bell barrows. Analyzing the high resolution images we can notice the presence of many “tumulus”, which appear to be not randomly arranged.
This study survey’s sub-meter resolution LiDar imagery is done in order to identify largely undocumented cultural heritage sites across a sparsely populated and undevelopedor wooded landscape.
We made measurements “in situ” in autumn and winter 2017. Subsequently an appropriate statistical study was carried out to infer the distribution function of the astronomical orientations with the aim to perform an appropriate archaeoastronomical analysis.
Statistical analyses of the orientations of the alignments were also carried out to determine whether or not the orientations we had found were due to chance factors. In this paper, we discuss our



193
methods and reveal the possibility of some intentional orientation of the structures and we propose that there could be an astronomical intent in building the burials found at Bonlez. Our final aim is to demonstrate that there are confirmations on the intentional orientation of the mounds and that we can continue with the appropriate surveys/excavations.

'Child of Earth & Starry Sky' – Orphic Gold Lamellae
George Latura
Independent researcher, Trumbull, USA
On Orphic/Bacchic thin gold lamellae found in ancient graves over a large area of the Greco-Roman world, the initiate repeatedly claims to be a child of ‘Earth and starry Sky’ (Graf and Johnston, Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets, 2013, p. 5–41). This declaration is reinforced in some instances by the phrase ‘my race is heavenly’ (p. 7, 17, 41), which suggests a cultic connection to the heavens.
Is there evidence in ancient texts and numismatics that provides support for a celestial interpretation of Orphic/Bacchic formulae that prepared initiates for the afterlife?
Some gold lamellae from Magna Graecia include an enigmatic phrase – ‘A kid I fell into milk’ – which suggests to Torjussen that milk was seen as a symbol of immortality: ‘A connection between milk and the stars, heaven, and especially the Milky Way, is confirmed in a number of written sources from the seventh century BC onwards’ (Stian Torjussen, Metamorphoses of Myth: A Study of the “Orphic” Gold Tablets and the Derveni Papyrus. Norway: University of Tromso, 2008, p. 147).
Immortality was often linked in ancient mythology to celestial milk and to the Milky Way. Most commonly, the infant Herakles, fathered by Zeus with a mortal woman, had to be nursed with divine milk if he were to attain immortality. Placed at the breast of the sleeping queen of the gods, the babe is pushed away when Hera awakens and the subsequent spurt of divine milk becomes the Milky Way (Timothy Gantz, Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources, 1993, p. 378).



195
Another version of this myth has Rhea, Zeus’ mother, presenting a stone wrapped in cloth to her child-swallowing husband Cronos (Saturn). When he tells her to give the infant some milk, she presses her breast and the resulting flow of milk forms the Milky Way (Robin Hard, Eratosthenes and Hyginus: Constellation Myths, 2015, p. 133).
The Rhea/baby Zeus version of the Milky Way story reveals an important cultic connection to Crete. In Paradise Earned: The BacchicOrphic Gold Lamellae of Crete (2010), Tzifopoulos narrows his focus to Orphic gold lamellae found on Crete, and he points to the Cave of Zeus on Mt. Ida where Rhea hid the divine infant from his fearsome father. Zeus’ wet-nurse was the nymph Amalthaea, or her goat, who provided milk for the infant god. In gratitude, Zeus placed the goat in the heavens as the bright star Capella, a tale told by Aratus (Phaenomena), and centuries later by Ovid (Fasti).
Cultic aspects of this Cretan myth are seen on coins of the Roman Republic (H. Seaby, Roman Silver Coins, Vol. I, [1952] 1989, p. 49), as well as on coins of the Roman Empire (c. 257 CE) that depict ‘Valerian II as the infant Jupiter riding on the back of the goat Amalthea,’ (David Vagi, Coinage and History of the Roman Empire, Volume I: History, 1999, p. 356), with the legend IOVI CRESCENTI (“the growing Jupiter”).
A connection to the heavens is evident in Plato’s celestial openings that lead to a heavenly afterlife (Republic, X, 614c), and Plato invokes a saying from the Mysteries: ‘Many carry the thyrsus, but few are Bacchoi’ (Phaedo, 69c). In a fragment from Euripides’ lost play ‘Cretans,’ an initiate from Crete declares himself a Bakkhos, a follower of ‘Zeus of Ida’ (Gillian Clark, Porphyry: On Abstinence from Killing Animals, 2000, p. 115).
According to Porphyry’s Life of Pythagoras (Kenneth Guthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library, 1987, p. 126), Pythagoras had



196
been initiated at the Mysteries of Mt. Ida, which would make him a Bakkhos, a Bacchic initiate. Pythagoras would found cultic practices in the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia, where several Orphic gold lamellae were found. According to Numenius, Porphyry, and Macrobius, Pythagoras taught that the Milky Way was the original abode of souls that required milk when they fell into terrestrial bodies. This would help explain the Orphic phrase ‘A kid I fell into milk’ found on gold lamellae from Magna Graecia.
The return of the soul to the Milky Way would be described in Cicero’s ‘Dream of Scipio,’ while the soul’s descent from, and re-ascent to, the Milky Way is elucidated by Macrobius (William Stahl, trans. Commentary on the Dream of Scipio by Macrobius. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990, 133-134).
The Orphic gold lamellae with the phrases ‘I am a child of Earth and starry Sky,’ ‘My race is heavenly,’ and ‘A kid I fell into milk,’ parallel the heavenly afterlife teachings of Pythagoras, who had been initiated at Mt. Ida in Crete, and the writings of Cicero, Manilius, Numenius, Martianus Capella and Macrobius, who linked the celestial afterlife of souls to the Milky Way.

In harmony with the cosmos: Of calendars & priests
George Latura1 & Sepp Rothwangl2
1 Indep.researcher, Trumbull, USA, 2 Indep. Researcher, Wien, Austria
During a recent discussion of ‘Cosmology in Culture’ (Campion, 2017), the notion came up that astronomy might have been the purview of scientific thought, while cosmology seemed more the domain of priestly concerns, at least in the past. McCluskey asked about the role of calculation in this scheme, which focused attention on calendars and their role in keeping cultures in harmony with the cosmos. The task of maintaining this harmony was often carried out by the priestly class.
Perhaps the most famous example of a priestly adjustment of the calendar in order to bring it in harmony with the cosmos was Julius Caesar’s reform that is still used today around the globe (with minor adjustments by Pope Gregory III). In 46 BCE, Caesar re-structured the yearly calendar of the Roman world. As Pontifex Maximus, the highest priest of the Roman religion (Hamlyn, 2011), Caesar had the power to move heaven and earth in order to restore cosmic harmony.
In ancient Athens, the chief priests of Eleusis calculated the intercalations of the lunar month in order to maintain the alignment of the Lesser Mysteries with Spring (Anthesterion, the month of flowers) and of the Greater Mysteries with Fall (Boedromion), the two solar seasons of the equinoxes (Mylonas, 1961). A cultic pre-occupation with the equinox can be traced across cultures for millennia, as in the most ancient temples of Malta (Lomsdalen, 2014), in Rome’s Mithraic Mysteries (Ulansey, 1989; Beck, 2006), and even in Mesoamerica, where Montezuma’s Templo Mayor had priests offering human sacrifice as the Sun rose at the equinox. “Evidently the priest and worshippers faced to the East to view the sunrise between the twin temples atop the great pyramid... The extensive plaza fronting the twin temples atop the Templo Mayor platform would have provided an excellent vantage point for witnessing the main event that usually took



199
place there. High on the terrace above, a victim, stretched out on his back over a carved stone and held fast by four assistants, could be seen awaiting sacrifice to the Aztec sun god. This took place when the High Priest plunged a flint knife into the victim’s chest and tore out the beating heart, offering it to the sun, thus ensuring the continuation of the movement of the solar deity on his course.” – Anthony Aveni, Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2001), p. 238.
Deadly violence could erupt when the priestly prerogative of seasonal calculations was seen to be under threat. Hypatia’s lynching in Alexandria may have been sparked by her efforts at establishing the date of the equinox for the calculation of Easter. Such usurping hubris may have aroused murderous intent in the followers of Cyril, bishop of Alexandria (Ari Belenkiy, ‚The Novatian ‘Indifferent Canon’ and Pascha in Alexandria in 414: Hypatia’s Murder Case Reopened.’ Vigiliae Christianae 70. Brill, 2016).
The predictive knowledge of astronomical calculations gave prophetic powers to thosewhocouldmakesuchcomputations,whetherinpredictingeclipses,orpredictingevenmoredireevents,suchasthereturnoftheSonofMan“likeathiefinthenight” (Thessalonians, 5:2). The dating system now used worldwide is the ‚Anno Domini’ that the Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus devised in 525, which may have been related to earlier predictions of the Apocalypse. The priestly role in determining calendarsseemstohavebeentakenseriouslyaroundtheglobe.

Eneolithic solar calendar in the Magura cave near the village of Rabisha, Belogradchik municipality, Bulgaria

Introduction: The Magura Cave is located in Northwestern Bulgaria, on the southern slope of the Karst ridge, near the village of Rabisha, 17 km northwest of Belogradchik. The cave is one of the largest Bulgarian caves and consists of several large and small halls connected through galleries and tunnels, with many stalactites, stalagmites and pillars, and even a small lake. Archaeological remains from the Neolithic to the late Roman period are found as well as Eneolithic paintings on the walls and ceiling of one of the galleries.
Monochrome paintings: The scenes are dedicated to the cult of fertility, and the signs are symbols associated with the magical rituals that the cave dwellers performed to seek help from deities in the difficult struggle for survival. The drawings are made with light brown ocher and bat guano. They are from different periods - Epipaleolithic, Neolithic, Eneolithic (maximum amount of drawings), Bronze and Early Iron age.
We have compared the symbols and arranged the presented celestial objects and phenomena, human cult activities, in a logically connected common narrative. The fact that more than 95% of the drawings are symbolic shows abstract thinking of their authors, which gives them the ability to record different knowledge, including not very complex philosophical concepts (Maglova, Stoev, Stoeva, 1997).

Fig. 1. Monochrome paintings from the Magura cave - anthropomorphic images, symbol signs, and calendar notations.
Reading of the Eneolithic Solar Calendar: In previous studies, it has been shown that the paintings reflect rituals related to fertility, cult practices at specific moments of the year, fixed by a well-arranged solar calendar. In this study, the so-called "solar group" drawings are analyzed, which consists of a series of astronomical symbols dominated by an adorable anthropomorphic Sun. The composition group is painted in the largest, so-called Sun Hall of the cave.
A scheme is proposed for dividing the paintings into groups, which gives a basis for creation of calendar within the tropical solar year. Their gradual reading structured and complicated the calendar by connecting it to the extreme positions of the sun. The first group consists of the central Sun and the symbols of the four seasons, whose beginning is connected with equinoxes and solstices. Consequently, the idea of annual seasons develops in following, smaller time



202
intervals - months. A critical analysis of each symbol representing the extreme points of the Sun on the ecliptic is made.
The next group includes chess structure images symbolizing the duration of the sidereal period of the Moon - 27 days. The reason for entering arithmetic and logic symbols (including adding, subtraction, multiplication by 2, repetition, logical forward/backward movements, understanding of the notion "integrity", calculation of the length of the year in days - 365) is formulated. In addition, the records reveal that one symbol has multiple conceptual meanings (the principle of "minimum symbols" - maximum information).
The third group analyzes the radial structure of the anthropomorphic Sun. The symbol is circular, which means cyclic repeatability, with the 13 rays being interpreted as 13 lunar months - a period close to the total number of days in the solar tropical year ~ 13.5 sidereal months. The analysis reveals an interesting fact related to the interchangeability of Earth and Moon, which sometimes are depicted in the paintings in the same way. We can suppose that all the Earth and Moon symbols are different levels of stylization of the Great Mother-Goddess image.
Conclusions: The investigated Eneolithic solar calendar from the Magura cave is autochthonous by territory and ethnicity. Some symbols of the Eneolithic solar calendar have a further use in folklore and folk ceremonies in later epochs.

The Universe Isn’t Silent: Electroacoustic Ensem
bles with Life 2.0
Deborah Kala Perkins
Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, USA
The universe isn’t silent. It has a sound track, that is played on space itself, because space can wabble like a drum; it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. We are adding to our glorious light understanding of the universe, a sonic composition (Jana Levin).
Ground and space-based gravitational wave observatories are listening to the universe for the ringing wabble of gravitational waves in space as it squeezes and stretches from colliding black holes; researchers are sonifying the data. The use of radio waves translated into sound are being used both by research astrophysics in the quest to detect new distant planetary orbits, and atmospheric compositions with Kepler Space Telescope data, as well as at the convening of cosmos and culture. Cosmologists are in quest of possible other universes seeking gravitational distortions in radio waves at the very edges of the perceivable universe. A software program is allowing blind astronomers to study data, as well as to assist sighted astronomers to discern patterns more readily accessible to the ear than by sight. Astrophysicists and astrobiologists, working with composers have developed “Acoustic Astronomy” translating astronomical data, particularly from radio sources into compositions to both inform and inspire. Astronomers are sonifying the data from the cosmic microwave background and pulsars to better understand the rhythmic and harmonic principles of our universe; while ALMA radio observatory, in Chile has developed a public archived data sound bank, to offer composers direct access. If we are living in an ocean of sound from cosmic processes, what might this imply about the nature and significance of each and every life expression on our planet, each unique



204
bio-organism and ecosystem? What might this imply regarding Earth’s harmonics with potential life and universal dynamics in space and on other worlds? This presentation will explore possible implications of our resonant immersion in life’s symphonics, and co-creativity in concert with cosmos.

Identification of Seris’ Constellations from
Memory and Experience
Arturo Morales Blanco, Alejandro Aguilar Zeleny, Julio Saucedo Morales, Raul Perez-Enriquez, and Jesus Galindo Trejo
Comunidad Comcáac, Hermosillo, Mexico Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Mexico Universidad de Sonora, Mexico Universidad de Sonora, Hermosillo, Mexico , Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico
The Comcáac Community is one of the nine recognized ethnical groups living in Sonora State in the northwest part of Mexico. Known under the name of Seri which means “people” in his language, this community has two main locations in the west coast of Californian Gulf: Punta Chueca and Desemboque. By oral tradition, the knowledge of the sky has been transmitted since remote times; a systematic effort oriented to recover the names of Constellations and their identification in Sonoran skyscape has been made by one of us (A.M.B.) who is a member of the Seri community. It was 1982, when he began a course on Cultural Promotion, oriented to give to young members of original communities, tools for the rescue of their culture and traditions. Around 1984 and 1985, Arturo received his father’s teaching about the skyscape of an experimented navigator. Figure 1 describe his first attempt to recover the Seri ́s Constellations [1]. In this presentation, a renewed and complementary work has been done in order to put this knowledge in a new framework: the use of computational tools such as Stellarium, to rediscover the constellations [2]. Seri boys receive since childhood, information about constellations for very important issues for the daily life: Orientation in the dessert and in the sea; breeding seasons of plants, animals and fishes; beginning of the productive activities; and, transmission of tales and stories about the ancestors and legends [1]. Located in the range between 29.0° to 30.5° N Latitude, the Seri people could have saw the



206
main group of stars giving them their own interpretation based on the animals and objects they could see around. The geographical places such as mountains, Tiburon Island and seashore, have influenced the naming of constellations. There are more than 20 specific constellations identified. For example, in March, groups of 300 to 400 crabs appear on the sands coinciding with the observation of ZAAMTH (“Jaiba”) over the western horizon; Seri people identify the “Jaiba” constellation as a crab with its legs pointing to the horizon. Using Stellarium, it is possible to make the identification with Betelgeuse, stars of the Orion’s Belt, and nearby stars, appearing at 04march, 19:20 h, near the meridian, and descending over the western horizon at midnight; and, at 25-sept, 5:45 am, it disappears near the meridian, due to the twilight, concurrent with the crabs being covered by sand in the beach. Seris also identify the star that fix the orientation at night as HIIZOOX CAANOJ HIIMATAAX which means “Estrella que no gira” (Non-revolving star); i.e., Polaris. Another example to consider is the presence in both skyscapes of the Arrow and Hunter: this constellation can be associated with Taurus and Capella star (The Hunter). These and other constellations are described and correlated with known stars.

The Archaeoastronomy is a multidisciplinary research field, whose objective is to identify the connection between the celestial manifestations and the ancient society, the influence of the cosmos on its behavior and on the development of its activities. For its full development, this discipline requires the collaboration of two scientific fields: archaeology and physics (astronomy). The study of archaeological findings, their orientation, location and characteristics (shapes, period, etc.), opens the possibility of establishing a connection with celestial events and consequently with the mentality of that time. However, the most delicate aspects of this discipline reside in the formal definition of a methodology and rigorous analysis technique, as well as the correct interpretation of the analyzed data. In this study, focus on the rock engravings, a new methodology has been developed to demonstrate as a plausible hypothesis the implication of the topography and the celestial sphere on the representations graven or painted by the societies of that time. In particular, we have analyzed the rock engravings placed in Castro (Soria) and Calaceite (Teruel), (Benavente, J. A., 2012) both regions of Spain of great interest due to the studies developed by the archaeologist Juan Cabré (Cabré, J., 1908) at the beginning of the 20th century. As a consequence of this research, the procedure presented is intended to be the start point for a



209
rigorous methodology which can be extended to other archaeoastronomical studies.

Rembrandt and the Telescope
Marilyn Gottlieb-Roberts
Independent Artist, Palo Alto CA, USA
Rembrandt’s Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is an official City of Amsterdam document. Against a shadowed architectural background a wall hanging dated 1632 testifies “Rembrandt made it” and officially certifies that the pictured physicians (two belated add-ons are at top and at far left) participated in Dr. Tulp’s lesson. A cadaver lies on a bare wood table. An open book is in the painting’s lower right corner.
In his masterpiece, Early Netherlandish Painting, Erwin Panofsky sees disguised symbolism in Netherlandish images, and meanings hidden under realistic surfaces. Thus perplexing details in this painting invite scrutiny. The cadaver of the freshly hanged thief attracts disproportionate attention through its central placement, visually assertive diagonal, and a disturbing anatomical error in the left forearm. None of the physicians, however, looks at the cadaver: four look at the book near his feet; the two add-ons look doltishly at nothing; and the distinguished Dr. Tulp gazes out-and-beyond. Two other instances of bold departure from the conventions governing Dutch civic portraits emphasize the separate natures of imagined and tangible worlds: the physician to Dr. Tulp’s immediate right (holding a list of the lesson’s participants) pierces pictorial space by gazing directly at the viewer; the open book leaning against an imagined right angle simultaneously leans against the real edges of the painting’s right corner. And Rembrandt’s desire to re-humanize the cadaver is touching: the strange proportions in the cadaver's right arm may indicate Rembrandt had-with genteel Dr. Tulp’s raised left hand as model--restored the cadaver’s amputated right hand; Rembrandt poignantly tucks the deceased’s penis into a fold of the white linen drape; and he shapes a navel with the “R” signature remarked upon by some scholars.



211
When the personal, technical, and cultural history of Rembrandt are taken into account, the Anatomy Lesson is not an isolated incident, but the product of a historical moment, which leads to questions of artistic meaning.
The Anatomy Lesson poses a three-part puzzler. First, a punning reveal involving the cadaver, in life a notorious outlaw named Adriaan Adriaanszoon. The compound microscope appeared first in the Netherlands in the late 1500s, followed in 1608 by the earliest known working telescopes. Netherlanders credited with this development include the astronomer Adriaan Adriaanszoon, a coincidence of names that connects the cadaver to the astronomer—and to the telescope. Next, Rembrandt uses three previously mentioned points—the imagined man gazing out to the real world; the imagined book leaning against the real frame; and four physicians preferring a published engraving to actual anatomy—to symbolically frame the separate natures of abstraction and reality. Finally, a prank. The painting’s



212
brightest colors and highest contrast emphasize the cadaver’s dissected left forearm, where the thumb’s position says, “hand in posterior view,” but the tendons argue, “nope, it’s an anterior view.” Academics chortle over Rembrandt’s mistake, but his “mistake” likely sent his equally frisky peers gleefully running to find a copy of the Belgian Vesalius’ influential 1543 human anatomy text to see if the tantalizingly unseen right page Rembrandt painted in Dr. Tulp’s wellthumbed copy of that book reveals an engraving of the anterior view of forearm tendons. Rembrandt's prank seems a playful interactive rant that, “abstractions are never to be trusted over the authority of one’s own eyes.
The Netherlands experienced early awareness of what changed when microscope and telescope expanded the range of the largest and smallest things we know; findings above and below that are abstractions. Rembrandt says abstraction has the power to undermine our affection for the real world.

A Vulva-like Rock Sculpture at Externsteine/Germany and Fullmoon as Indication for Sexual Rituals
Sepp Rothwangl
Independent Researcher, Wien, Austria
The Externsteine in Kreis Lippe/Germany is a monument with significant astronomical function originating from pre-Christian or prehistorian time. Historical events and religious reliefs suggest that the Extersteine were a sacred district. One of Its most important astronomical components is the so called Sonnenloch (sun hole) orientated towards the rising sun at summer solstice. This circular window is located in the Höhenkammer (high chamber), an apse with an altar at top of the Turmfels (Rock II). At the base of Turmfels on the Northeast side is a platform, called Kanzel. A staircase leads up to this platform. The seven steps of the staircase suggest a symbolic connection to the seven visible Wanderers in the heavens. At the front of the podium a vulva-like rock structure is readily identifiable.
The prominent position suggests a function of major importance. This sculpture will be discussed from an anthropological, astronomical, and calendrical point of view. It seems to designate the place for gathering at special times. It may be speculated that the sun hole mentioned above stands for the summer solstice, a date which however in ancient times could not be found to the day, but was a trigger to the summer full moon for tribes counting lunar days. According to Knight (1995) for late-Pleistocene tribes: When the moon had left the night sky would be the time for women-as-wives to withdraw from temporary marriage and seclude themselves. This would signal to men-as-husbands to prepare and deliver collective hunting services, while the full moon was the signal for the relaxation of these taboos.



214
Synchronicity of menstruation with the new moon suggests this conclusion. May this poster attract attention to investigate formation and age of this sculpture, which was previously ignored and unpublished.

Development over time and astronomical orientations of the Demir Baba teke near the village of Sveshtari, Bulgaria
Mina Spasova1, Alexey Stoev2 and Penka Maglova2

Introduction: Demir Baba Teke is an Alevi mausoleum (türbe) from 16th century, situated south-west from the village of Sveshtari, Isperih municipity. It is part of the Sboryanovo historical and archaeological reserve and was a sacred place for Thracians, Christians, and Alevis (kind of unorthodox Muslims). The tomb of the saint of the Alevis is a monumental building with a dome and an antechamber with an entrance to the east. Demir Baba is the most honoured saint among the Alevis population of northeastern Bulgaria, and the legends of his authority and power are countless (Balkanska, 1992). Christians also accept Demir Baba as their own saint. Today the complex is a cult place worshipped by Muslims and Christians. According to the collected legends in the region of Demir Baba Teke, in different periods, there was an ancient Thracian settlement, a monastery and a Bulgarian monastery "St. George".
Archaeoastronomical research: The study of astronomical orientation of Muslim cult complexes from the Middle Ages and their relationship with earlier religious objects is at an early stage. Measurement of the orientation of the main axis of the monument has been made to verify the hypothesis of "solar orientation" of the earliest foundations of the building – the Thracian sanctuary.
Azimuth of the main axis of the mausoleum and geographical coordinates of the site have been measured: A=64o10'55'', Latitude φ=43.739073° and Longitude λ=26.752782°). The height of the sun above the true horizon is + 7.6o. It is evident that the azimuth is in



216
north-east direction where the sun rises during the summer solstice. Around the solstice the declination of the sun is equal to the inclination of the ecliptic ε towards the celestial equator, which changes through the different ages.
Determining the declination of the sun we can determine ε. Thus, using astronomical data we can date the archaeological monument. The calculations show that the declination of the sun is δ=+23°01'. Comparison with the astronomical calendar shows that the main axis of the temple is not directed to the summer solstice point on the horizon and gives us two mirror dates that correspond to the declination we found. Such a declination the sun may have several days before and a few days after the solstice. We assume that these dates are related to significant holidays in Islamic religion. We know that the monument was built in 1560. The slope of the ecliptic in 1560 is 23o29'47''

217
(respectively, the declination of the sun during the solstice will also have the same value) but we obtain δ=+23o01'. This indicates that the main axis of the cult facility is oriented to sunrise with a full disk (the size of the solar disk is 30') above the horizon on the day of the summer solstice for that epoch.
A match of the summer solstice with the Ramadan holiday (in the Islamic religion) occurred in 1556 (June 28) and 1557 (June 18) according to the Gregorian calendar. This gives reason to believe that the main axis of the teke is oriented with an accuracy of ± 1' in one of the two years towards the sunrise at summer solstice.
Conclusion: Remains of several consecutively built Thracian sanctuaries are excavated in the yard of the Demir Baba teke cult complex. Associated with the cult towards the rock and the water, the power of the Great Mother-Goddess and the Sun God, this sanctuary retained its significance throughout the first millennium BC, through the Roman, early and late Middle Ages, till nowadays. Cult practices and orientations of the ceremonial buildings maintain the legends of the Giant, the Giver of goods, the Iron Father, embodying the transition from the Bronze to the Iron Age, including astronomical and sacral knowledge.

A calendrical interpretation of spirals in Irish megalithic art
Marc Türler
University of Geneva, Versoix, Switzerland
The tumuli of Newgrange and Knowth in Ireland are among the most monumental heritages of the Neolithic epoch. The megalithic constructions date back to around 3'500 BC, a millenium before the completion of Stonehenge and five centuries before the Egyptian pyramids. Corridors inside the mounds have been shown to be perfectly aligned such as the sun rays illuminate the interior chambers at the winter solstice at Newgrange (Ray, T.P., 1989, "The winter solstice phenomenon at Newgrange, Ireland: accident or design?", Nature 337, 343) and at equinoxes at Knowth (Eogan, G., 1986, "Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland", London: Thames and Hudson). Many of the kerb and interior stones of these passage tombs are richly decorated with petroglyphs (e.g. O'Kelly, M.J., 1982, "Newgrange: Archeology, art and legends", London: Thames and Hudson). Despite several attempts to classify and interpret the engraved signs (e.g. Brennan, M., 1994, "The Stones of Time", Inner Traditions International; Thomas, N.L., 1988, "Irish Symbols of 3500 BC", Mercier Press), their meaning remains mostly enigmatic to visitors and archeologists alike. Spiral motifs are very characteristic for Ireland in general and particularly for these tumuli of the Boyne Valley. We intend to show here that they could be symbolic representations of the cycles of the Moon and the Sun. We study and interpret the precise design of five different spiral patterns, which are among the most carefully engraved motifs on prominently placed stones in Newgrange and Knowth. The validity of the proposed calendrical interpretation of these designs is supported by the identification of five distinct monthly, seasonal or annual observables - easily accessible to prehistoric naked-eye observers, which seem to be progressively incorporated in increasingly



219
complex spiral patterns. In some cases, the geographic orientation of the stones and adjacent signs give additional evidence. If our interpretation is correct, it would imply that an elite of the neolithic inhabitants of this northern region linked the observed celestial cycles of the Moon and the Sun to the passage of seasons, followed them carefully over years, and tried to represent the observables with complex, cyclical signs. This process from observations to models and their encryption for preservation can be considered as a truly scientific methodology. The association of these calendrical representations with monumental constructions - thought to be somehow related to death and the otherworld (Lewis-Williams, D. and Pearce, D., 2005, "Inside the Neolithic Mind: Consciousness, Cosmos and the Realm of the Gods", London: Thames and Hudson) - suggests that astronomical cycles could also have had a spiritual meaning. The daily, monthly and annual solar and lunar cycles could have inspired ideas of an analogue cycle for life with the possibility of rebirth in this or the otherworld.

Astronomy in the northern Bronze Age. The ring patterns on the women ́s belt plates astonomically/geometrically analyzed.
Astrid Wokke
Member of the "Gesellschaft für Archäoastronomie", Gilching, Germany
In the northern Bronze Age some women wore remarkable jewellery: bronze necklaces and bronze belt plates with ring patterns. In mythologie there are indications that jewellery is not just decoration. In the first poem of the Edda for instance, the Prophetess sets her necklace and rings in connection to prophecy and magic wisdom.
This poem, "Voluspa", tells the story of the creation of the world as well as that of its compending cataclysm, the Ragnarok. Hertha von Dechend, who was professor of the history of science, states that in this poem the astronomical phenomenon of the precession is described in a mythical way: the poem does not deal with the end of the world, but instead it deals with the end of a world age. This would mean, that the jewellery of the Prophetess turns up in an astronomical setting. The question arises, if the "rings" could be understood in an astronomical way, like the rings of an armillarsphere or the circles on a planisphere. The jewellery of northern Bronze Age women show a striking likeness to the jewellery of the Prophetess.
These considerations led me to measure the ring patterns on the bronze belt plates stereographically, using the drawings of "Die Funde der älteren Bronzezeit". The results show that declination circles, not only of the solstices but also of the major and minor lunar standstill seem to underly the circle patterns on the belt plates in a complex way.

A 17th century "Mountain Calendar" from Zywiec (Poland): an erudite's invention or a local Mountaineers' tradition?
Mariusz Ziółkowski, Maciej Sobczyk
University of Warsaw, Warszawa, Polska
The city of Żywiec, Polish Carpathian Mountains, at the end of the 17th century. Mayor of Zywiec, Andrzej Komoniecki, writes down his life's work - a history of the city and its surrounding area, titled "Chronography or the History of Zywiec". In the foreword, he describes the geographical surroundings, tells of how the setting sun changes its place during the year against the backdrop of mountain peeks. He also recounts several legends concerning these sites. Are these but the inventions of a cultivated city dweller, or testimony to a folk tradition dating back to the early Middle Ages, and even perhaps to the I-II century A.D., when these regions were still populated by Celtic Cotins? We will attempt to answer this question using historical, ethnographic and archaeological data.

Archaeoastronomical stratigraphy: Investigstions on a cisalpine celtic enclosure
Stefano Spagocci and Adriano Gaspani
SMS Consulting, Cinisello Balsamo, Italy
The Mt. Avaro Barec is an elliptical enclosure, located in the Bergamo province (Lombardy, northern Italy). Thanks to previous studies by Gaspani [1], its inner structures were known to be astronomically aligned and probably date to the Iron Age but the enclosure proper was thought to date to the Middle Ages. In June 2017, the structure was re-measured (by the authors and a team of amateur archaeoastronomers we would like to thank for their contribution) and re-examined from the statistical point of view. The aim of this exercise was to try to obtain a reliable dating for the artefact while double-checking the previous analysis. The structure was consequently re-measured by establishing a GPS base and referring our compass measurements to such a base. The data were then processed through SkyMap [2].
The axes of the ellipse turned out to be oriented towards the rising of Fomalhaut and the setting of Rigel, respectively. Besides the stellar alignments, we found that the two axes are oriented towards the sunrise on the Belotepnia and Lugi Naissatis and the sunset on the Ambiolcaia and Trinvxtion Samoni Celtic festivals, respectively. We also found alignments to the extreme positions of the Moon that turned out to be fundamental for dating the site.
Based upon previous algorithms by Gaspani [3], Spagocci then devised a suite of algorithms aimed at dating an astronomically oriented structure on the basis of its stellar and/or lunar and/or solar alignments, the details of which are described in a forthcoming publication. Suffice to say here that we define a time bin, centred on the real time of the alignment under test, in which an ancient astronomer



224
might have spotted the alignment. We then plot, with a suitably chosen sampling rate, the number of alignments of the given kind that are found in each time bin. The most probable date, of course, is located in the time bin where a maximum is found. We then devised a procedure for converting such an approximated dating into a most probable dating with a statistical error. In this phase Bayesian statistics is also employed, in order to assess the archaeological plausibility of each putative alignment.
On the basis of the above-mentioned analysis, we claim that the whole site is astronomically significant and underwent two building phases. In the first phase (510±70 BC), the inner structure was erected and aligned. In the second phase (320±90 BC), the inner structure was realigned and the elliptical enclosure erected and aligned, with a procedure Gaspani was able to clarify, as detailed elsewhere [2]. The randomness probability for the alignments is 0.5%.
Gaspani was also able to estimate the probable unit of measure used when dimensioning the structure. It then occurred to the author that such a measure is suspiciously close to the size of a human step and, since there is a well-defined relationship between the size of a human's step and her/his height, it was then possible to estimate the height of the person (a druid?) who laid out the structure. The height was estimated to be 160±16 cm. Spagocci then remarked that such an height seems to be on the short side (even considering the epoch) and did a literature survey on the height of ancient Europeans. It turned out [4] that, on average, h=161±6 cm (for women) and h=169±6 cm (for men). It was then estimated that, with 75% confidence, the structure was laid out by a woman. The enclosure, then, is quite likely to have been aligned by a priestess. This may be proof that both male and female druids were present in Cisalpine Gaul.



225
In the authors' opinion, the results presented here, besides being remarkable by themselves, might be relevant for the archaeoastronomical science in general. In fact, our methodology allowed us to derive totally unexpected information on the structure. In particular, we were able to read the probable archaeological stratification of the site. In this sense, an archaeoastronomical stratigraphy exercise was performed.

Coricancha (Qurikancha, Qorikancha) was the most important temple in Cuzco, the capital of Tawantinsuyu, the Inca Empire. The Spanish Conquistadores had the opportunity to see her, and her legendary riches, in November 1533, after entering Cuzco. Coricancha was the place of worship of the most sacred effigies of the Inca cult, including the figure of the Sun, called Punchao. From this early period, there are also references, unfortunately not very precise, related to a specific



227
orientation of some elements of the temple, in order to obtain a reflection of the rising (or setting) Sun of on the aforementioned figure of Punchao. On this source basis, and the analysis of the remains of the original Inca Coricancha, a number of hypotheses regarding the possible astronomical function of this temple were formulated. Of particular importance was the hypothesis of R.T. Zuidema and A. F. Aveni, according to which observations at Coricancha were the structural skeleton of a specific Inca calendar cycle of 328 days. This article presents a critical analysis of this hypothesis, based on long-term research and measurements carried out in the Coricancha by the authors of the text.
