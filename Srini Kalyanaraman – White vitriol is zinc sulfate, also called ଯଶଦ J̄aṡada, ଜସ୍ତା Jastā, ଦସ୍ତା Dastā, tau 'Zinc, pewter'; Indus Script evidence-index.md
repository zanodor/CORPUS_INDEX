Yāska’s nirukta vii.23: “...आदिेत्य कं सं वा मदिम् वा परिमृज्य प्रदिस्विे यात्र शुष्क गोमयमसंस्पशशयन् धाियदि" (sarup, 1967, p. 144) [translated by sarup as “...a person holds a polished piece of white copper, or crystal,focusing the sun-rays in a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it: it blazes forth; and this very (terrestrial) fire is produced.” (sarup, l. (1967). The nighaṇṭu and the nirukta: the oldest indian treatise on etymology, philology and semantics [text, introduction, english translation and notes] (2nd reprint). Motilal banarsidass.p. 125)].
I submit that the white copper or crystal detailed by yaska as kamsam relates to white vitriol or zinc sulfate. The polished piece of white copper may compare with a high-tin bronze aranmula mirror or bronze mirror of the type discovered in kulli, ca. 2nd m. BCE.

A surprising find during archaeometallurgical provenance isotope analyses is that most of the copper used in Eurasia came from India's Khetri mines.

Tuttha (िुत्थ ) is a Sanskrit technical term corresponding to “Copper Sulphate”. It is also known as Sasyaka. It is commonly used in Rasaśāstra literature,
e.g., Rasaprakāśasudhākara, Rasaratna-samuccaya, Caraka-saṃhitā, Suśruta-saṃhitā. (Tuttha (िुत्थ ).—n. Blue vitriol, [Suśruta] 2, 13, 2)
Tuttham or Blue vitriol, sulphate of copper, especially medicinally considered as an Anjan, or application to the eyes. This blue Sulphate of copper, is usually applied to the eyes as a sort of collyrium or medical ointment. Tutthā (िुत्था ):—[from tuttha] is also a name applied to the indigo plant, [cf. Lexicographers, esp. such as amarasiṃha, halāyudha, hemacandra, etc.]

‘The following extracts from Ball’s ‘Economic Geology of India’ will also throw considerable light on this subject (minerals). It will be seen how in India the traditions of the technical arts of which we get vivid glimpses in the Rasarnava have been preserved even to our own days from time immemorial. ‘Rajputana – Copper ores are found in several of the Independent States of Rajputana, and also in the British district of Ajmir. Mining has been practiced on a large scale, but at present the trade of miner is becoming extinct and the operations, which are only carriedon in a few of the localities are of a petty nature. The names of the States in which there are mines are as follows: Alwar, Bhartpur, Jaipur, Udepur, Bundi and Bikaner. Alwar State – According to Mr. Hacket there are ancient copper mines at the following localities in this state: Daribo, Indawas, Bhangarh, Kusalgarh, Beghani, Pratabgarh, Tassing and Jaisingpura. The most important of this is the first. Deribo – The mine is situated on a sharp anticlinal bend in a thin band of black slates intercalated in the Alwar quartzites. There appears to be no true lode; the one, which is pyrites mixed with arsenical iron, occurs irregularly disseminated through the black slates, a few specks and stains only being seen in the quartzites; occasionally rich nests of ore were met with...From an interesting account of Major Cadell, the following facts regarding the manufacture have been extracted. The ore, as usual in the native process, is pounded, made up into balls with cow-dung roasted, and then smelted in a closed furnace and refined in an open charcoal fire. Thirty pounds of ore require four times that quantity of charcoal and yield 5 1⁄2 pounds of metal or 16.6 percent. During the last 12 years the average annual outturn has been only 3 tons 8 cwts., and it is diminishing owing to the influx of European copper. Singhana (Jaipore State) – The copper mines at Singhana are situated in rocks belonging to the Arvali series. The earliest account of these mines which is believed to have been by Captain Boilcan, was published in the year 1831. The principal productions were copper, blue vitriol or copper sulphate, alum, and an ore of cobalt called sehta or saita. The mines are described as being tortuous and of great extent; at the working faces it was the custom to light fires which caused the rock to split up. Lamps were used which the miners carried on their heads and with a gad and hammer extracted the ore. The principal ore found appears to have been pyrites. It was sold retail by auction to the proprietors of different furnaces. The pounding or crushing was effected on stone anvil with a hammer weighing eight or ten seers; when completely reduced to powder the ore was made up into balls with cow-dung and roasted. The blast furnaces (vide illustrations) were prepared in the following manner. A quantity of common sand was spread on the door of a circular cut, in the centre of which a depression, 12 to 15 inches in diameter and 2 or 3 inches deep, was made; in this a layer of fine sand



9
another of ashes were laid to prevent the metal from adhering to the bottom of the receiver; two clay nozzles or tuyers were then placed on opposite sides of this hollow and a third between them, leaving the fourth side vacant for the slag to escape. The nozzles were then connected by moist clay and a circular rim of mud, a few inches in height, was raised, on which three annular vessels of fireclay were placed to form the body of the furnace, each of these was 15 inches in external diameter, 10 inches high, and 3 inches thick. They were used repeatedly, but the lower part of the furnace had to be reconstructed for every charge. The bellows were simply goat-skins connected with the nozzles, and were worked by the families of the smelters. After a preliminary firing, to dry the mud, the furnace was charged with charcoal, roasted ore and iron slag, the latter being employed as a flux. In a day of nine or ten hours’ duration, 3 maunds of charcoal, 2 1⁄2 of the roasted ore, and 2 of the iron slag were consumed. The slag was drawn off and the smelted copper which had accumulated at the bottom of the furnace was removed on the following day. It was then re-melted and refined in an open furnace under a strong blast from bellows, and cast into small bars or ingots, which were subsequently removed to the Mint and cut up and fashioned into coins. The ore was said to yield only from 2 1⁄2 to 7 1⁄2 percent of metal, but the profits must have been not inconsiderable as the Khetri Raja is said to have claimed one-sixth of the value of the copper in addition to Rs. 14,000 received for the lease. The quality of the metal is said to have been inferior to that of Basawar, this being attributed to the use of the iron slag as a flux...Considerable quantities of blue vitriol (copper sulphate), alum and copperas (iron sulphate) are manufactured from the decomposed slate and refuse of the mines. The slates are steeped in water, which is afterwards evaporated in large iron vessels, when the blue vitriol, is crystallized out, afterwards the alum, and lastly the copperas. Mr. Mallet found traces of nickel and cobalt in all three of these substances. Copper smelting in the Singhbum District (Bengal)—Indications exist of mining and smelting have been carried on in this region from a very early period, and the evidence available, points to the Seraks or lay Jains as being the persons wh, perhaps 2000 years ago, initiated the mining (Proc. As. Soc. Bengal, June 1869, p.170). The number and extent of the ancient workings testify to the assiduity with which every sign of the presence of ore was exploited by these early pioneers and those who follow them up to recent times...Alum and Green Vitriol. Dutt speaking of alum states: ‘it is not mentioned by Susruta, in his list of metallics, but later writers give its synonyms and uses.’ This is evidently incorrect. Alum, with green vitriol, is distinctly referred to in Susruta, e.g.’’
In the above sloka surashtraja, lit., begot of Surashtra (modern Surat), is used in the sense of alum. From the ancient times the ‘earth of Surat’ has been known to yield this mineral. Amara Simha in his Lexicon, written sometime between 400-600 AD, gives among others the following synonms of alum: kAmkshI, tuvarI and surashtraja. Rasaratnasamucchaya also gives the same synonyms (Bk. III, 59-62). The manufacture of alum survives to our own days, as the following descriptions will show: ‘Alum shales, so called, are of rare occurrence in peninsular India, and, so far as is known, the only considerable native manufacture is situated in Rajputana; but as will be gathered from what follows, the tertiary rocks of the extra-peninsular regions often contain such shales. In two localities lumps of alum...occur



10
naturally in sufficient abundance to be a regular article of export. Alum is principally used as a mordant in dyeing, but as a drug its employment is extensive in India. Behar—Captain Sherwill in 1846 (Journ. As. Soc. XV, p.58) stated that a small quantity of alum was manufactured from slates obtained in the district of Shahabad; these rocks, it is believed, belonged to the Bijigarh pyritous shales of the Kaimur group of the Vindhyan serie. The alum was sold at the high price of one rupee per tola; it was identical with the salajit of Nepal. Copperas or iron sulphate is obtained in the same region, which is situated to the north of Rotasgarh, and to the west of Sone. Rajputana, Khetri, and Singhana – In connection with the copper mines at the above localities there are manufactories which turn out considerable quantities of blue vitriol (copper sulphate), copperas (iron sulphate), and alum. The process has been very fully described and illustrated by Colonel Brooke. In 1864 there were twenty of these factories at Khetri and about double the number at Singhana. The broken shale from the mine which contains the salts is placed in earthen gharas, together with crusts from the refuse heaps of previous lixiviations and water is added. The gharas are arranged on ledges prepared for the purpose on the heaps of refuse, as will be seen by reference to the woodcut (vide illustrations). Each charge of shale is exposed to three changes of water and the water itself is changed fom one ghara to another till it has taken up the sulphates from seven different steepings. It is then of a thick dirty-bluish colour and is taken to the boiling house, where it is boiled in earthen gharas; when sufficiently concentrated it is left to cool, and thin sticks being introduced the blue vitriol crystallizes on them The mother liquor is then poured off and again boiled, and on the addition of saltpetre, the alum crystallizes at the bottom of the vessel. The residual sulphates still in solution, are allowed to crystallize out by exposing the mixture to the sun. (pp.139-147) “CUTCH – There are numerous accounts of the manufacture of alum in Cutch. Manufacture of alum. The earliest account (of manufacture) is by Captain Mc Murddo, who states tthat before 1818 the exports of alum amounted in some years to several hundred thousand maunds, which chiefly went to Guzerat and Bombay to be employed in dyeing. The following account by Mr. Wynne is the most recent and complete. The site of the operations is Mhurr or Madh. ‘The rock containsing the material is a pyritous dark-gray or black shale, which is in close association with a soft aluminous psudo-breccia of the sub-nummulitic g group. This shale is extracted from pits and is exposed for four months, a slow combustion taking place owing to the decomposition of the pyrites. It is then spread in squares resembling salt pans and sprinkled with water. After about 12 days it consolidates into efflorescing mamillated crystalline plates or crusts called phitkari-ka-bij or seed of alum. These crusts are boiled in large iron vessels (luted inside with lime), together with saltpetre (or other potash salt), in the proportion of 15 of ‘alum seed’ to 6 of the latter; when it has settled, the liquor is placed in small earthen vessels somewhat the shape of flower-pots, and crystallization takes place in three days. These crystals are again boiled one or more times in concentrate the solution, which is finally ladled into large thin bladder-shaped earthen mutkās or gharās with small mouth; these are sunk into the ground to prevent their breaking, and in five days the alum is found crystallized in masses. The vessels are then broken and the alum is stored. Alum is also manufactured from the water of a hot spring north of Mhurr. The impure saltpetre, which is employed to supply the second base in the above-m,entioned manner, is obtained by lixiviation of villae refuse. (Ball’s ‘Economic Geology’, pp. 431-33). Iron Sulphat. The green vitriol or copperas of commerce, which is known to the natives as kahi and hara kāsis, is produced principally from the so-called alum shales from which alum, copperas is found sometimes as a natural exudation upon alum shales and other rocks which include iron pyrites. This native copperas goes by several different names in India, according to the nature of the other substances with which it is combined. Behar. In the year 1833, Mr. J. Stevenson published an analysis of native sulphate of iron obtained from Behar, which was

Copper from Gujarat used in Mesopotmia, 3rd millennium BCE, evidenced by lead isotope analyses of tin-bronze objects; report by Begemann F. et al.
The conclusion is:
"Unsere bleiisotopische evidenz legt nahe, das in Mesopotamien fur legierung mit zinn verwendete kupfer urudu-luh-ha stamme aus Indien, was ebenfalls vertraglich ist mit einem import via dilmun." (Trans. Our lead isotope evidence suggests that the urudu-luh-ha copper used in Mesopotamia for tin alloying is from India, which is also contracted with an import via Dilmun.)" (opcit., p.28)
1. A lead isotope study »On the Early copper of Mesopotamia« reports on copper-base artefacts ranging in age from the 4th millennium BC (Uruk period) to the Akkadian at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. Arguments are presented that, in the (tin)bronzes, the lead associated with the tin used for alloying did not contribute to the total in any detectable way. Hence, the lead isotopy traces the copper and cannot address the problem of the provenance of tin. The data suggest as possible source region of the copper a variety of ore occurrences in Anatolia, Iran, Oman, Palestine and, rather unexpectedly (by us), from India. During the earliest period the isotopic signature of ores from Central and North Anatolia is dominant; during the next millennium this region loses its importance and is hardly present any more at all. Instead, southeast Anatolia, central Iran, Oman, Feinan-Timna in the rift valley between Dead Sea and Red Sea, and sources in the Caucasus are now potential suppliers of the copper. Generally, an unambiguous assignment of an artefact to any of the ores is not possible because the isotopic fingerprints of ore occurrences are not unique. In our suite of samples bronze objects become important during ED III (middle of the 3rd millennium BC) but they never make up more than 50 % of the total. They are distinguished in their lead isotopy by very high 206Pb-normalized abundance ratios. As source of such copper we suggest Gujarat/Southern Rajasthan which, on general grounds, has been proposed before to have been the most important supplier of copper in Ancient India. We propose this Indian copper to have been arsenic-poor and to be the urudu-luh-ha variety which is one of the two sorts of purified copper mentioned in contemporaneous written texts from Mesopotamia to have been in circulation there concurrently.
