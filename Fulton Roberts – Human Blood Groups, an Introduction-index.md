The Peripatetic's Problem
"Send at once to the operating-theatre two units of freshly drawn AGD blood." I debated with myself, does this mean Group A, type Rh\ blood, or blood freshly drawn into acidcitrate-dextrose solution? In view of the emergency I decided to send group 0, Rh-negative blood, which I duly marked with its blood type 0 dd. A few minutes later the telephone rang. "What's wrong with this blood? It looks all right to us." I replied, " There is nothing wrong with the blood." " Then why have you marked ' Odd ' blood all over the place? "
I am indebted to the editor of The Lancet for permission to quote a peripatetic correspondent; and to Blackwell Scientific Publications (Oxford) for permission to quote from Race and Sanger's " Blood Groups in Man."



PREFACE
T H E publication of The Rhesus Factor in 1947 was intended to assist those who at that time found the topic bewildering. The ensuing decade has not only rendered t h a t book out of perspective but also provided many other succinct expositions of the subject for the reader's use. I t may be, however, t h a t the rapid rate of increase in knowledge that twelve years ago caused the Rh blood groups to appear confusing, is today engendering a similar perplexity concerning human blood groups as a whole. To those who find it so this work is offered as a simple introduction to the topic in the hope that it may be found useful. In 1949 I was taken to task by a reviewer for pretending that the rhesus factor was indeed a difficult subject.
i( His only armour is an algebraic nomenclature, stripped of which he stands revealed as the mere clinical application of a very simple principle of immunity. . . . Nevertheless there is a strong rumour abroad that the R h factor is hopelessly complicated, capable of analysis only by the most acute . . . it would be so much better to let the doctor straightway into the secret . . . that certain clinical facts have been obscured by much published laboratory data. It is quite an ordinary message, but it has been ciphered by those serologists with their cabbalistic signs and hieroglyphs." I range myself on the side of the reviewer, departing from his view only in ascribing the " cabbalistic signs and hieroglyphs " as much to geneticists as to serologists. I t is the notation of blood groups, including the Rh groups, that is a prime source of confusion and this is very much a genetical matter. The reader of this book may feel t h a t the time for a

revision of blood-group notation is near, and t h a t it will justify the temporary inconvenience of being obliged to become adapted to a new system. The immunological features of blood groups are quite straightforward and differ little from those of bacteriology. As it is this aspect of the topic t h a t will principally concern the clinician I have ventured to introduce this account with a chapter on elementary serological matters. There is, however, one other potential source of difficulty that I have sought to remove. It is common practice for the student to enter the topic of blood groups by a consideration first of the ABO system. This is no doubt partly because of its cardinal clinical importance and its priority in discovery. But this practice implies that the ABO system is both simple and typical, a view which I do not share. The order in which I have presented the material, and which I believe to be logical, leaves the ABO system almost till the last. The reader who wishes to learn only about the Rhesus factor (D) and the ABO system can omit Chapters V to VII without impairing the continuity of the account. An objection may be raised against my order, namely that the reader must carry in his mind the presumption of ABO compatibility throughout all the earlier chapters which deal with the other groups ; but this need applies to the bench alone.
No citation of authorities is given in the text, but a short bibliography has been compiled at the end. Needless to say the chief source to which the interested reader will wish to turn for further detail is Race and Sanger's splendid book Blood Groups in Man, from which, with the consent of authors and publishers, I have quoted a figure and relevant text on p. 53. I am most grateful to Dr. Race for reading this manuscript before publication.

CHAPTER I
SEROLOGICAL INTRODUCTION
I F the blood of a certain animal—say the sheep—is
introduced into an animal of a different species—say the
rabbit—one of the consequences will be the appearance
of antibodies in the serum of the recipient. The most
important property of these antibodies is that they will
combine with and react with samples of the injected
material, or material containing the same chemical sub
stances ; and this process of combination and reaction
may be observed either in vivo or in vitro. Antibody formation is brought about by the parenteral
access of foreign material—that is to say, material which
does not form any part of the recipient's organism. Thus
no animal normally forms antibodies against any substance
that is part of itself or of its biological inheritance. Not
all foreign material will evoke antibodies in the recipient,
but nearly all proteins of substantial molecular weight
will do so, and there are a few non-protein substances that
have this power. Often the foreign molecule contains
protein but the antibody shows a disposition to combine
particularly with the non-protein parts of it. Such
antibody-provoking substances are called antigens. The
antibodies that arise are serum globulins moving with the
gamma fraction.
On the first occasion that a subject encounters a foreign
substance the response is relatively slow. The antibody
producing cells, whichever these may be, do not provide
a rapid accumulation of antibody and it may be a fort
night or more before there is provided an excess of anti
body sufficient, after union with the injected antigen, to

be detectable in the free state in the recipient's serum. The quantity of antibody in the serum then rises very slowly to a maximum by about six weeks after the injection, and thereafter steadily declines. On the second, and subsequent occasions, however, the response is more rapid and antibody may flood the circulation seven to ten days after exposure to the antigen. Once the subject has made antibody against a certain antigen he may be described as " immunised " to this antigen and remains in that state for life, so far as can be judged. This must not be taken to imply that there are always antibodies present in the immunised subject's serum throughout life, far from it. But once immunised, the rapid antibody response (called the secondary immune response) will always follow any exposure to the antigen however long this may be after the first encounter. I t follows t h a t the amount of antibody detectable in a patient's serum is no index of the degree of immunity and is of limited practical value as an isolated observation. Another important property of antibodies is their specificity. Each chemical substance in the injected material provokes its own antibody that will unite with it and act independently of the others. I n the example mentioned, of injecting sheep's blood into a rabbit, the recipient would form antibodies against substances found in the serum of the sheep as well as those on the red cells of the sheep. If the sheep cells had been washed free of serum before injection, only antibodies against the red cells would be provoked in the rabbit. And as sheep red cells have a number of chemically distinct antigens on their surface, so several independent antibodies would be formed in consequence. The presence of such antibodies in the recipient's serum may normally be recognised in vitro by two common laboratory reactions. The first of these would be by



S E R O L O G I C A L I N T R O D U C T I O N 11
showing the power of the antibody to lyse the appro
priate red cells in the presence of fresh guinea-pig serum
as a source of complement, the whole test being conducted
at body temperature. This procedure (immune haemo
lysis) is rarely adopted in routine work on human blood
groups ; it is mentioned again in only one context in
Chapter VIII. But it is worth remembering that this
is very probably what happens in vivo when blood is
injected into an animal that has already formed anti
bodies against the injected cells ; the existing antibody
and the ever-present complement cause the cells to break
down, and the danger to the recipient results from the
difficulty in disposing of these damaged cells. The other method of recognising antibodies against red
cells is by agglutination. Antibodies against red cells will,
in most cases, cause cells of chemical constitution similar
to those that provoked the formation of the antibody to
agglutinate, that is, to adhere together in large clumps.
Not all antibodies against red cells can cause agglutination
and these exceptions are considered in Chapter IV in some
detail. The normal way of estimating by agglutination the
quantity of antibody in the serum of an immunised
animal is to prepare a series of increasing dilutions of the
serum being studied, to which are added equal volumes of
a suspension of red cells of appropriate antigenic consti
tution. The greatest dilution that effects agglutination is
noted (say, 200 times, or a dilution of 1 in 200) and this is
called the titre ; it would usually be expressed as " 200 "
in the example given. This is not, of course, an absolute
measure, nor is it particularly accurate. But it serves as a
comparison of the amounts of antibody in the serum of
different animals, or of the same animal at different
times.
It may be necessary to identify and separate several
Ba



12 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
antibodies in one serum. To reconsider the original example of injecting sheep cells into a rabbit, suppose the sheep's cell contained two antigens, S found only in the sheep and G found also in goats. If the serum is tested against sheep cells and goat cells the titre might be the same in each case, say 200. To differentiate between the two antibodies it would be necessary to " absorb " the serum successively with sheep cells and goat cells. Absorption consists of exposing a portion of serum to an excess of cells for a period of time to permit union of antibody with antigen. The sample is then spun in a centrifuge and the serum decanted and the cells discarded. When this process has been repeated two or three times with fresh cells it can be assumed that all the antibody against those cells has been removed from the serum. In the example the result might be as in the Table I.

The serum thus contains anti-G in a titre of 200 and anti-S in a titre of 50. The example mentioned—the injection of sheep cells into a rabbit—illustrates another matter. Most rabbits already contain in their serum antibodies that agglutinate sheep cells, though it cannot be supposed that they have in fact encountered sheep cells at any time. These are



S E R O L O G I O A L I N T R O D U C T I O N 13
called " naturally-occurring " antibodies, implying that
they are not known certainly to result from exposure to
the antigen concerned. There are no doubt many objec
tions to referring to them thus, for they may not be
naturally-occurring and are not typical as antibodies,
but as they are frequently encountered in blood-group
work it is desirable to be able to refer to them until a
fuller understanding enables us to label them more
precisely. The immunisation of one species with washed red cells
from another is an example of hetero-immunisation. One
might enquire what happens if blood from one member of
a species is injected into another member of the same
species. If red blood cells in all members of a given
species were identical in chemical composition no anti
bodies would be evolved. In fact, however, the red cells of
some members of a species differ chemically from those of
other members ofthat species, and these differences, which
are inherited, are called blood groups. This is as true of the
horse, cow, sheep and rabbit as it is ofman, but only human
blood groups are to be considered here. The injection of
blood from one member of the human species into another,
as happens quite commonly now that blood transfusion is
widespread, may result in antibody formation if certain
precautions are omitted ; this may be called iso-immuni
sation. Iso-immunisation in man is attended by certain
dangers to health ; it also provides the antibodies by
means of which human blood groups are studied. It is of
these matters that this book treats.



OHAPTEB II
THE RHESUS FACTOR
THE discovery of the ABO groups by Landsteiner in
1900 was the first demonstration of human blood groups.
They did not assume clinical importance until the dis
covery of citrate as a harmless anticoagulant rendered
blood transfusion a practicable procedure about the time
of the First World War. And it was not until the Second
World War that transfusion became so widespread a prac
tice that a knowledge of blood groups became an indis
pensable part of the pathologist's equipment. Blood
groups other than ABO had been discovered in 1927 (M,
N and P, also by Landsteiner associated with Levine) but
they evoked little interest as they were of no clinical
importance. On the other hand the discovery of the
Rhesus factor in 1940 (also by Landsteiner associated with
Wiener) aroused very considerable and widespread interest.
There were three reasons for this ; first, it was clearly
demonstrated that this new blood group could cause
disease among infants as well as being responsible for
transfusion reactions ; secondly, the considerable increase
in transfusions in the early days of the war brought these
dangers into prominence, and, thirdly, the interesting pro
perties of the Rhesus factor gave new stimulus to the
several fields of study associated with blood groups,
namely serology, genetics and anthropology.
The Rhesus factor was discovered during the course of
some experiments in which blood of the Rhesus monkey
(Macacus rhesus) was being injected into rabbits. The
sera of the rabbits agglutinated all samples of the monkey
cells, as would be expected, but they also agglutinated
14



T H E R H E S U S F A C T O R 15
some, but not all, of the samples of human red cells to which they were exposed. This observation implied that some, but not all, individuals of the human species had a red-cell antigen that was universal among rhesus monkeys. The proportion of people possessing the monkey's antigen among those sampled in New York was about 85 per cent. and a similar incidence was found in Britain ; this varies considerably, however, in different parts of the world and among other races. The antigen thus became known as the Rhesus factor, and those possessing it were termed " Rhesus positive " and those lacking it were " Rhesus negative." The latter terms, which are still in use, are generally abbreviated to Rh positive and Rh negative. The antigen is no longer called the Rh factor, for reasons that will appear later, and is now referred to as the bloodgroup antigen D. The distribution of D is quite independent of A, B and O. Rh positive persons, therefore, carry the antigen D on their red cells. Rh negative persons lack this antigen but may be regarded as possessing instead an antigen called d.* These substances are inherited according to mendelian law and it is likely that there are genes for D and d, one or other of which occupies a certain site on the chromosome. The several genes of which one will occupy a certain site on the chromosome are called alleles. Each individual receives paired chromosomes, one from each parent, so that a rhesus negative person will have received two d's and his genotype will be expressed as dd. Rhesus positive persons may have received two D's, having thus a genotype of DD ; but they may alternatively have received one of each type, so t h a t their genotype would be Dd. In the former case the state is referred to as homo
* As a matter of fact the existence of d is not proved, nor that of
the antibody, anti-d ; but the present argument may be allowed to
stand until p. 35.

zygous and in the latter heterozygous ; rhesus negative persons, of course, are all homozygous.

A word on the use of certain symbols might be convenient at this point. The letters D and d may refer, according to the context, either to the genes themselves or to the antigens on the red cell resulting from the action of these genes. I n practice it is nearly always apparent which construction is to be placed on the symbols, but it has been recommended that the distinction should be made by using italics thus, DD, when genes are being referred to and leaving the roman type to express antigens. It has not been thought necessary to adopt this practice here but it will doubtless become increasingly employed with benefit to clarity. Another source of confusion is the adoption of capital and small letters to distinguish between those two alleles. This practice may give rise to the erroneous impression that D is a mendelian dominant and d a recessive character. This is not true. The difference between a dominant and recessive character is that the recessive cannot be recognised if the dominant is present in the same individual. If an anti-d antibody* were produced in a DD person by injection of dd cells, and could be shown to agglutinate Dd cells, then d would be as dominant as D. I n practice both D and d are regarded as of equal dominance. It is true that it is much easier to produce anti-D in an Rh

T H E R H E S U S F A C T O R 17
negative person than anti-d in an Rh positive one, but this is because D is a very powerful antigen and d an exceptionally weak one. The difference between D and d, therefore, is not at a genetic level but an antigenic one ; the whole importance of D, the Rhesus factor, is solely due to its being a very powerful antigen. Its importance has become particularly emphasised by the considerable increase in the use of blood transfusion during the last twenty years. About one white person in seven is rhesus negative and if blood were administered regardless of R h grouping the chances of such a person receiving rhesus positive blood would be about 6 to 1. As about half the number of rhesus negative people so transfused (for the first time) would produce antibody it can be calculated t h a t random transfusion regardless of R h group would produce anti-D antibodies in about one in every sixteen persons transfused. It may be thought that to cause a patient to produce Rh antibodies in his serum is not particularly serious, for no ill-effects follow and patient and doctor alike may be unaware that immunisation has occurred. It is true that on the first occasion of this happening no detectable damage may result. But should the patient require a subsequent transfusion a severe reaction is almost certain to follow the administration of D positive blood. Transfusion reactions result from administering to a patient blood containing an antigen against which there is already an antibody present in the patient's circulation. The antibody causes the destruction of the transfused cells. In mild cases this may take no more serious a form than an increased rate of elimination of the transfused cells from the recipient's circulation, and the worst that can be said is that the transfusion can have done no good. In more severe cases, however, the rapid destruction of the cells causes the symptoms of a transfusion reaction,



18 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
sweating, pain in the loins, restlessness and, in severe
cases, partial or complete suppression of urine. The prin
cipal danger to the patient is the damage to the kidneys
that may result from the rapid destruction of the trans
fused red cells by the patient's antibody. Consideration
will later be given to the steps necessary to ensure that
the donor's and recipient's blood are compatible.



CHAPTER III
HiEMOLYTIC DISEASE OF THE NEWBORN
THE discovery of the Rhesus factor in 1940 was oppor
tune. During the previous decade the number of trans
fusion reactions when the ABO groups were known to be
compatible was exciting comment. And at the same time
explanations were being advanced for certain disorders
of newborn children occurring in several members of the
same family, that were based on a supposed incompati
bility between mother and child. It was thus soon
apparent that the Rhesus factor was responsible for both
these anomalies. The transfusion reactions were shown to
be due to incompatibility of the Rh blood groups and
brought about by anti-D. And the mothers of the sick
children were also shown to have Rh antibodies in their
serum which had damaged the red cells of their foetuses,
giving rise to a condition called haemolytic disease of the
newborn. What was not clear was how these maternal antibodies
had arisen. Undoubtedly in a number of cases the anti
bodies had been evoked by incompatible transfusion. In
others, however, no evidence could be obtained of any
transfusions having been administered to the mothers at
any time, and anti-D has never been shown to occur
naturally. There was considerable speculation about
whether the foetus itself could provoke antibody produc
tion in the mother. It is true that the foetus could be Rh
positive even in a rhesus negative mother, the positivity
(D) being inherited from the father ; but it was not easy
to see how the foetal blood could pass from child to
mother to provoke antibody formation in the latter, the
19

placenta seeming to present a barrier impassable by red cells. Recently it has been shown, however, that it is quite possible for fœtal blood to enter the maternal veins. In some circumstances a haemorrhage of unknown cause may arise from the foetal side of the placenta so that at parturition, or even before, some of this blood may enter the dilated uterine sinuses of the mother. This being so, one would not expect any firstborn child to suffer from this condition, for the mother would not become immunised until her first parturition was accomplished. This is indeed true and, with very rare exceptions, no firstborn child is affected with the disease unless, of course, the mother had already been immunised by incompatible blood transfusion. To sum up, therefore, one can say that only rhesus negative mothers are vulnerable, and only those married to rhesus positive fathers can bear vulnerable infants. The rhesus negative mothers may have been immunised against D by incompatible transfusion and, if so, all their rhesus positive children would be exposed to the antibody. If these immunised mothers were married to homozygous (DD) husbands, all their children would be rhesus positive and at risk, for DD X dd can give rise only to Dd. But those married to heterozygous (Dd) husbands could bear some rhesus negative offspring (Dd χ dd = Dd or dd) who would not be threatened, for dd infants would be unaffected by an anti-D antibody. I t follows from these considerations that the transfusion of Rh positive blood into an R h negative female before or during the child-bearing period of life is an error of such gravity t h a t it may deprive her of the opportunity of ever bearing a live child. No single fact in the whole realm of blood-group study is more important than this. If, how ever, it is made the rule never to transfuse any female



H J I M O L Y T I C D I S E A S E OF N E W B O R N 21
that has not passed the menopause without first deter
mining her blood group, and to administer only rhesus
negative blood to those who prove to be rhesus negative,
then no woman will be artificially immunised against D.
And if this is so, then the incidence of haemolytic disease
due to the antigen D will be no greater than the incidence
of retro-placental haemorrhage in rhesus negative mothers.
Not only is this incidence low, but such mothers as are
immunised in this way may expect at least one child, their
first, to be unaffected by the disease. It is important to
emphasise that the natural incidence of the condition is
very low, and though about one marriage in ten is between
a rhesus negative wife and a rhesus positive husband, only
in about one in twenty of such marriages is there any
evidence of haemolytic disease ; and in most of these the
disease is mild and in many of the others it can be success
fully treated. The cause of the disease, as has been explained, is the
immunisation of rhesus negative mothers against the Rh
antigen D. But it is the children, not the mothers, who
suffer from hsemolytic disease. The mother's antibody,
anti-D, can reach the fœtus in utero as nearly all anti
bodies can, probably by passing directly across the
placenta though other routes have been suggested. The
infant's circulation can thus be flooded with anti-D during
pregnancy so that the red cells of Rh positive infants will
be subjected to a continuing and destructive bombard
ment with the maternal antibody.
Very little is known about how the fœtus disposes of
the broken-down red cells and their products in utero, but
one would suppose that anaemia would invariably be a
consequence of these circumstances, and so it is. In very
mild cases there may be no other abnormality, and the
fœtus, having adapted itself successfully to its anoxic
environment in utero, is born with a mild anaemia which



22 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
may pass undetected : a condition formerly known as
congenital anœmia of the newborn. It is, however, slow to
mend and the bone marrow responds very sluggishly
during the first few weeks of life when, in any case, there
is also a heavy demand for red cells because of the growth
in size, and hence of circulatory volume, of the newborn
infant. Thus the danger in these cases, which are not
common, is that the neonatal anaemia is overlooked and
the child is found in extremis two or three weeks later. At the other end of the scale, in the very severe cases
the antibody exerts such widespread damage on the red
cells in utero that the foetus succumbs before birth. The
effect of such extreme anaemia in utero is to disturb, in
some way, the fluid balance of the fœtus with the result
that there is generalised oedema. The condition is thus
known as hydrops fœtalis. It is not common but it is
fatal, for even the few infants born alive succumb within
a few hours, or at most, a day. The most common manifestation of this disease, how
ever, lies between these two extremes and differs from
each. The infant is born, often prematurely, with some
degree of anaemia and with a considerable amount of
maternal antibody still in its circulation. Once this anti
body is excreted, as like most foreign substances it will
be, there is no further cause for deterioration. But in the
neonatal period the antibody will continue to destroy red
cells probably as fast as the bone marrow (and other
centres) can make them. So the anaemia rapidly worsens
and may kill the child.
Fortunately infants with this condition do not seem to
suffer any renal disorder in consequence of trying to dis
pose of broken-down red cells as would an adult receiving
an incompatible blood transfusion. But the infant does
have difficulty in disposing of one product of excessive
red-cell destruction, namely, bilirubin. How the fœtus



H ^ M O L Y T I C D I S E A S E OF N E W B O R N 23
disposes of excess bilirubin in utero is not clear, but it
certainly succeeds in doing so. After birth, however, the
excessive rate of red-cell destruction liberates more bili
rubin than the neonatal liver can handle so that bilirubin
accumulates in the circulation and the infant soon becomes
deeply jaundiced. Jaundice being so prominent a feature
of the condition, it is called icterus gravis neonatorum, and
is the third of the syndromes that make up haemolytic
disease of the newborn. A word about bilirubin may be helpful at this point.
The bilirubin that is formed from the breakdown of haemo
globin is recognised by the indirect van den Bergh reaction.
It passes in the circulation to the liver where it is con
jugated with glucuronic acid and secreted into the bile.
The conjugated form is recognised by the direct van den
Bergh reaction, and it differs from the unconjugated form
in being more soluble. The clinical differences between the
haemolytic and obstructive types of jaundice illustrate the
chemical differences between the two forms of bilirubin.
It has been suggested that the name " bilirubin " be
reserved to the product of haemoglobin breakdown before
it reaches the liver, and that the conjugated form be dis
tinguished by being called simply " conjugated bilirubin."
In haemolytic disease it is bilirubin proper, and not the
conjugated form, that is concerned. The jaundice in haemolytic disease exposes the infant to
another peril. It seems that during the first week of life
the endothelium of the vessels in the brain have not yet
acquired the impermeability that later protects brain
tissue from certain substances that might damage it and
which may be found in the circulation. Bilirubin is one
of these, and there is no evidence that in normal circum
stances bilirubin ever reaches the brain in adult jaundice
of any form. But in infancy the bilirubin not only reaches
the brain but, once there, interferes with the tissue



24 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
oxidation of certain cells, particularly those of the basal
ganglia, and also stains them. This may happen in other
parts of the body, but certain brain cells seem to be parti
cularly vulnerable and many of them die. The result is a
serious neurological disturbance in the first week of life,
called kernicterus, which frequently kills the infants or
leaves signs of permanent residual damage of the brain in
those that survive. It might be thought that kernicterus would develop
from other causes of jaundice in the first week of life. It
does not do so in congenital obliteration of the bile duct,
partly because jaundice may arise later than the first week,
and perhaps because the conjugated form of bilirubin,
which is here concerned, may be less toxic for brain tissue.
Kernicterus may develop, however, in premature infants,
particularly those that have received large doses of vita
min K. In these premature infants the liver is not yet
fully developed and takes some time to mature. Hence
several days may elapse after birth before the liver can
conjugate bilirubin at the rate required even for normal
red-cell breakdown and the pigment accumulates in the
blood. Administration of excessive vitamin K worsens the
situation by promoting some haemolysis of the infant's cells. The infant with hsemolytic disease is thus threatened
with two dangers. The first of these is anaemia, mild in the
case of congenital anaemia : so severe as to be irremediably
fatal in hydrops fcetalis : and of considerable and worsen
ing severity in icterus gravis. The second danger is that
of kernicterus following an accumulation of bilirubin
during the first week of life. The severity of these two
processes is to some extent independent of each other for,
though the increased blood destruction causes anaemia and
predisposes to kernicterus, it is the degree of immaturity
of the liver that finally determines the severity of the
latter.



H J M O L Y T I C D I S E A S E OF N E W B O R N 25
Many of the signs and symptoms of haemolytic disease
of the newborn have been referred to in discussing the
natural history of the disease, but there are others that
merit mention. In all forms of the disease, other than the
mildest anaemias, the liver and spleen are enlarged, indi
cating a prolongation into extra-uterine life of the use of
tissue in these organs for erythropoietic purposes. There is
also a bleeding tendency, which can be marked ; indeed,
in the nineteenth century so many infants with this dis
order died of umbilical haemorrhage that it was thought
that such haemorrhage might be a hereditary characteristic
so often did it exhibit itself in families. In severe cases the
signs of anaemic heart failure with raised venous pressure
may be found. In all cases there is lethargy and difficulty
with feeding, and all the symptoms and signs, which are
manifest very quickly after birth, reach their height
between the third and eighth days. Finally there is an
element of apparent toxicity in all but the mildest cases,
most noticeable when kernicterus is super-imposed. Ker
nicterus itself is principally characterised by local or
general hypertonicity often spasmodic, deafness and,
terminally, pulmonary haemorrhages. It has already been mentioned that the firstborn infant
usually escapes haemolytic disease, and an explanation of
this fact has been offered. What has not been explicitly
stated is a much less easily explained fact that once a
mother has become immunised against the D antigen and
borne an affected child, all her subsequent Rh positive
children are also affected. This is an important fact, for
though immunisation is uncommon, once it occurs the
problem is serious, particularly, of course, in families whose
firstborn is sick or dead from other causes. It is important
to determine if the father is homozygous or heterozygous,
for if he is the latter (D/d) some rhesus negative, and
therefore unaffected, children can be expected.

It is not easy to explain this continuing morbidity from a single cause in one family. It might be that the initial immunisation could provoke enough antibody to kill or harm successive R h positive infants over a period of five or ten years ; but there is as yet insufficient evidence on this point. If, on the other hand, a new antigenic stimulus arises with each pregnancy it is difficult to see why retroplacental haemorrhage from the fœtus should occur invariably with some mothers and never with others. This matter is not well understood and some light might be thrown on the matter if it could be shown that the disease in the subsequent children was regularly more severe, or less severe, or regularly increased or decreased in severity. There is no absolute rule about this and, indeed, the prompt application of treatment hinders uncomplicated assessment of this matter. But there is a general impression that in some families the disease on the whole continues to be mild in all the siblings, whereas in others the disease remains severe or worsens. This observation may not help in determining the cause of the condition, but is important in considering the advice to offer to a family about prognosis and treatment. There are three forms of treatment which need to be considered. The first is t h a t which applies only to those infants that are discovered to have a severe anaemia in the second or third week of life ; they need a transfusion of rhesus negative blood. The second and most important form of treatment is exchange transfusion which is applied soon after birth. In this a plastic catheter is passed up the umbilical vein into the vena cava and a 20 ml. syringe with a three-way tap is attached. This allows an alternating withdrawal, discarding and replacement of 20 ml. volumes of blood. The blood used for replacement should be rhesus negative (so t h a t it is unaffected by the antibody) fresh (to ameliorate the bleeding tendency) and partly packed



H J E M O L Y T I C D I S E A S E OF N E W B O R N 27
(to provide good oxygen-carrying power without over
loading the circulation).
This procedure enables a number of the infant's ills to
be corrected. In the first place rather more blood can be
withdrawn than is replaced, which relieves the raised
venous pressure that may accompany anaemic heart
failure. Secondly the discarding of the infant's own blood
disposes not only of the antibody that is destroying its
cells but also some of the bilirubin that is damaging its
brain. Finally the provision of rhesus negative cells tides
the infant over the dangerous neonatal period of anaemia
until the antibody is finally excreted and a new population
of its own rhesus positive cells has arisen. Properly applied
exchange transfusion is safe and curative. It underlines
the need for ante-natal diagnosis so that delivery in hos
pital, where proper facilities are available, can be ensured.
Hence every pregnant mother must be rhesus grouped,
and antibodies sought towards the end of pregnancy in
those that are rhesus negative. If this were regularly done
it would enable all those that might require hospital treat
ment to be admitted, and greatly reduce the mortality
from this disease. This extremely important point should
not be overlooked, for this is one of the occasions, rare in
medical practice, when disease can be anticipated by
preparedness. The indications for exchange transfusion can be easily
assessed. The infant is threatened with two possible
causes of death, anaemia or kernicterus, each ofwhich needs
consideration in the individual case. The risk from anaemia
can usually be gauged from the cord haemoglobin level.
If this is less than 15 G per 100 ml. it is wise to transfuse,
for experience has taught that in these cases the level soon
falls quite abruptly. The cord bilirubin level is not, how
ever, any guide to the risk of kernicterus, for it cannot be
a measure of post-natal liver function. The serum bilirubin
02



28 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
level must, therefore, be estimated periodically during the first two days of life (or longer in some cases), and exchange transfusion is called for if a level of 20 mgm. per 100 ml. is exceeded. There has been considerable debate for some time about the value of the third form of treatment, premature induction of labour. There are sound reasons for believing t h a t in the majority of cases the infant is probably better adapted in utero to anoxia and to bilirubin excess than it would be post-natally, when its liver would be very immature and its general health prejudiced by the consequences of prematurity. There is much to be said, therefore, for allowing the pregnancy to go to term in the hope, among other things, that the liver will be relatively mature. Nevertheless, there are undoubtedly cases that benefit from early induction of labour. By way of example, perhaps a little exaggerated, one may consider the position of a mother who has lost her first child from pneumonia and the next three, stillborn, from hydrops fœtalis. The outlook in such a case, if the father is homozygous, is extremely unfavourable and it is to be doubted whether, without assistance, such a mother could ever expect to bear a living child. With such a prognosis, early induction, followed by exchange transfusion, probably repeated several times, offers the best hope of saving the child. I t has also been suggested that the mother's antibody titre should be under continuous observation during pregnancy so that labour could be induced at once if the titre suddenly rises in the last few weeks before term. Hsemolytic disease may also arise, though not commonly, from immunisation against blood groups other than D, when it takes much the same course as is here described. But one important and not uncommon exception is when the A and B groups are responsible for the disease, a matter discussed on page 59.



C H A P T E R IV
RHESUS ANTIBODIES
THE rhesus antibody (anti-D), discovered in 1940, dis
plays two properties that might go some way towards
explaining why it was not detected earlier. First, the
agglutinated clumps of cells are sometimes loosely held
together, and are easily dispersed on shaking. Secondly,
anti-D agglutinates effectively only at body temperature.
The somewhat crude blood-grouping techniques that had
been considered adequate hitherto (e.g. shaking antiserum
and cells together on a tile at room temperature) would
not have revealed the action of anti-D at all easily. A further reason why anti-D must commonly have gone
unrecognised was revealed by some most important
observations made in 1944, namely that some samples of
anti-D could be shown to have united with the red cells
without having agglutinated them. Of course, there are
circumstances in which such a state of affairs is not at all
remarkable. For example (as has already been described)
an antibody against sheep cells prepared in the rabbit
might agglutinate the appropriate cells when it was diluted
200 times but not when diluted 2,000 times ; nevertheless,
in the latter case some antibody can be shown to be
attached to the cells, for the addition of some guinea-pig
complement would effect lysis of the cells. The difference
here is quantitative ; but this is not the explanation of
the failure of some samples of anti-D to bring about agglu
tination, for they fail whatever their strength.
Normally the agglutination reaction is divided arbi
trarily into two stages. In the first stage antibody becomes
attached to (sensitises) the cells, and in the second stage
29



30 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
the cells come together in clumps. Evidently some samples
of anti-D could effect only the first stage and hence they
were called " incomplete " antibodies to distinguish them
from the agglutinating samples of anti-D. Since prac
tically all blood-group work from 1900 until 1944 had
been based on the agglutination reaction, it is easy to see
that these incomplete antibodies would not have been
detected. Incomplete anti-D does not differ from agglutinating
anti-D in specificity : each reacts only with cells con
taining D. If both forms of antibody are present in the
same serum it is usually the incomplete form that suc
ceeds in uniting with the antigen on the cell surface, often
to the exclusion of the agglutinating form. Cells sensitised
in this way by incomplete anti-D would not be agglu
tinated by agglutinating anti-D because their D antigens
would already be occupied (" blocked " in serological
jargon). There are grounds for believing that the incom
plete form reaches the foetus more easily and is therefore
more dangerous in hsemolytic disease of the newborn. A number of methods for detecting incomplete anti-D
have been developed of which three (and their variants)
are in general use. The first of these is to employ certain
diluents other than saline as a suspending medium. The
use of human plasma or 20 per cent, bovine albumin or
dextran of suitable strength as a testing medium usually
enables incomplete anti-D to agglutinate Rh positive
cells. The albumin test is very convenient in routine blood
group work and is, on the whole, reliable, but some
samples of incomplete anti-D will be missed by this
method.
The second technique, which is also quite simple and
useful, is to treat the cells under standard conditions with
dilute solutions of certain proteolytic enzymes of which
trypsin, ficin and papain are known to be effective. This



R H E S U S A N T I B O D I E S 31
treatment renders Rh positive cells agglutinable by nearly all samples of incomplete anti-D. This is a reliable test in skilled hands, but there is always the risk that over-treatment of the cells may result in panagglutinability. The third technique is the antiglobulin reaction or Coombs test. Rhesus positive red cells carry a number of D antigens scattered over their surface to which the incomplete anti-D antibodies become attached. Since these antibodies are composed (as all antibodies are) of serum globulin, one can picture the sensitised red cell as having human globulin likewise scattered over the surface in the distribution of the D antigen. An antibody against human globulin would thus cause these cells to agglutinate. An antibody can easily be prepared against human globulin by injecting this substance in any animal that is not human. In practice human serum is injected into rabbits or goats, and the resulting antiserum, after being absorbed with human cells, will agglutinate only those cells that have incomplete antibody absorbed on their surface, i.e. sensitised cells. The test is, therefore, very usefully applied to newborn infant's cells ; if it is positive, the cells are sensitised and the only source of antibody is the mother, hence a diagnosis of haemolytic disease can be made with certainty. Likewise, a negative test would exclude the disease (but see p. 60). It is the most valuable single test in the diagnosis of haemolytic disease. I t is also useful in detecting incomplete antibody in serum, by exposing Rh positive cells to the serum and, after washing the cells, testing them with an antiglobulin serum. The cells need to be washed thoroughly whenever the test is performed, for any human serum not attached to the cells would neutralise the antiglobulin serum before it could agglutinate the cells. This test is reliable for all blood group systems, but the trypsin and



32 H U M A N B L O O D G E O Ï Ï P S
albumin tests, though useful for anti-D, fail to react in
some systems. These three tests are all in use in routine blood-group
work and enable the incomplete antibody to be detected
and measured as accurately as the agglutinating form.
Titrations of anti-D however, are of only moderate value
for clinical assessment, both because techniques differ
among laboratories and also because the severity of the
infant's illness is by no means always correlated with the
maternal antibody titre. But it has been claimed that
continuous observation of the mother's level of antibody,
determined by the antiglobulin test, would enable the
clinician to detect promptly any marked change that
might adversely affect the foetus and to reconsider the
possible forms of treatment. Perhaps the most important consideration about anti-D
from the point of view of clinical practice is its scarcity.
Kh grouping can be carried out only by the use of anti-D,
agglutinating or incomplete. The only source of anti-D is
the immunised patient. The prevention of disease due to
anti-D can therefore be fostered best by arranging that
those immunised patients who can spare a little blood at
the appropriate time should be bled by the Regional
Transfusion Service and their serum made available.
Twenty ml. of serum would suffice for several hundred
tests.



CHAPTER V
THE Rh COMPLEX
VERY soon after the discovery of D and anti-D it became
clear from independent work in Britain and America that
other closely related but distinct reactions were regularly
observable. Some additional antigens with their respec
tive antibodies were evidently closely associated with the
Rh antigen D. It is possible to construct a table to show
the relationship between the four antibodies that had
been studied by the end of 1943 (Table III).
TABLE III
Antibody No. 1 + - — — — + ?
2 ++- +- - ?
3 - + -- + - +
4 - + + + + -
The reader need not be disturbed by the fact that this
table is an artificial presentation. It is a condensed sum
mary of a mass of data and shows that four distinct anti
bodies can be recognised, each displaying a consistent
pattern of reactions with seven distinct antigens. The
second antibody is anti-D (though it was not then so called)
and the pattern of reactions indicates an association
between these antibodies. The relationship of the first and
fourth antibodies is particularly direct for their reactions
are the opposite of each other. From this last observation Sir Ronald Fisher deduced
that the antigens being recognised by these two antibodies
were mutually exclusive. In other words the genes deter
mining these antigens were alleles (like D and d) so that
33



34 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
one or other, but not both, could be inherited from a parent and occupy the appropriate site on the chromosome. He called these two alleles, and the antigens they determine, C and c, no doubt because A and B were already in use as blood group symbols. Having explained the reactions of the first and fourth antibodies in this way, Fisher supposed that, as the reactions of the second and third antibodies were not opposite to each other, two further antibodies might be encountered having reactions antithetical to numbers 2 and 3. And so it proved. Fisher's predictions were soon confirmed and the two antibodies having the reactions expected of them, were apparently discovered. These six antibodies were recognising six antigens which Fisher called C and c, D and d and E and e. Each person might inherit one of each of these three pairs from one parent (it might be CDe for example) and another trio from the other parent. Thus the antigenic structure, or genotype, of a single individual might be expressed, thus, CDe/cDE as an example. The seven sets of antibody reactions given in Table I I I were thus seven of the eight possible combinations of CcDdEe ; and Fisher again successfully predicted the discovery of the eighth combination which was found in a sample of cells a few years later. The completed set of reactions is given in Table IV in which the antigens and antibodies are given the names they now bear. The evidence on which Fisher's predictions were based is surrounded by a line. It is necessary to pause at this point to examine the situation as it appeared in the late 1940's. It appeared that an individual might inherit from each parent a complex of three R h genes, and t h a t each of these genes would be one of a pair of alleles, C or c, D or d and E or e. No question has arisen about the Cc or Ee pairs ; nor is

there any doubt about D. But now, some ten years later,
doubt has arisen about anti-d.
One cannot now be certain that the existence of d and
anti-d has been unequivocally demonstrated. Despite
much work and experiment no samples of anti-d have
come to light in recent years. One may take the view that
d does not exist. Or, knowing that c and e do exist, one
may say that d is bound to turn up sooner or later as so
many other predicted blood groups have done. And one
may be so impressed by the symmetry displayed by blood
group genes that hope for the discovery of d may still be
sustained. But at present the existence of d is not proved.
The reader may feel that he has been the victim of a deceit
in that the whole argument has been built on the existence
of d and the nature of its difference from D. But what is
doubtful about D and d is perfectly certain about E and e
or C and c, or, for that matter, any other blood group
systems to be discussed. The presumption of d's existence
is a matter of convenience in exposition and will be main
tained, but it is necessary always to bear in mind that the
existence of d is not proved,



36 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
A general element of doubt should also be voiced at this point. All that is said in this chapter about the Rh complex represents a working hypothesis widely accepted for some years. Some recent observations, not entirely consistent with this hypothesis, have cast some doubt over the matter. But this hesitation should not prevent the reader from enjoying this exposition until a substantially revised synthesis becomes generally accepted. One may turn now to a consideration first of the consequences t h a t flow from Fisher's synthesis and then of the additional alleles more recently discovered. Fisher's synthesis at once simplifies and explains what might otherwise appear a complex series of reactions. I t is based on the view that there are three closely-situated but independent sites on the chromosome (loci) which will receive one of each pair of alleles. The closeness of the loci, as well as their independence, can be illustrated by examining further evidence. The loci are regarded as closely-situated because the three antigens are not inherited independently, but as a complex ; a Cde/Cde parent, for example, would be capable of handing on only Cde. This is another way of saying that genetical crossovers do not occur between these sites, and as crossing-over occurs commonly between genes that are not close together, it can be assumed that these sites are indeed close. Indeed no cross-over has ever been detected between these sites, no case having been encountered of a person having a combination not found in either of his parents. The evidence of Table V, however, suggests t h a t cross-overs do occasionally occur between these loci. Before examining Table V it is desirable to recall that the labels C, D and E arose arbitrarily, influenced by the order of discovery ; there was no reason to suppose t h a t this represented the order of loci on the chromosome. I n fact, as will be supported by evidence in the ensuing para



T H E E h C O M P L E X 37
graphs, there is reason to believe the order to be DCE. Since the order is probably DCE and since D is the most important of the antigens it would be a small, but rational and desirable, step towards the improvement of notation if all genotypes were expressed in this order. This practice is already gaining ground and will be followed here.

Table V shows the approximate incidence of the eight Rh antigen complexes in Britain, and it will be observed t h a t there are three orders of frequency; those t h a t are relatively common, 12 per cent, or over, those of 3 per cent, or less and finally dCE of exceptional rarity.

Occasional cross-overs, therefore, occurring in the common
complexes would furnish those that are less common and,
as in each of the three cross-overs postulated, Dee (or
cDe) results, one might suppose that it would occur about
three times as commonly in the population as the other
complexes of the second order of frequency. Reference to
Table V shows this to be so. The rarity of dCE may be
explained by its formation being possible only by a cross
over involving one of the less common complexes, and
hence it could be expected that its incidence would be
extremely low. It should be made clear that these calcu
lations apply to the population as a whole, and no cross
over in any particular family has been detected. For what this evidence is worth it does support the view
that the three loci, though very close, are occasionally
separable by cross-overs. A further piece of evidence
suggests that the loci, though close, are independent. This
was the discovery of a sample of blood in which no repre
sentative of the C or E loci could be detected. It suggested
that a small piece of chromosome normally carrying the
C and E loci had disappeared from this subject and only
the D locus remained. This sample of blood was called
— D —/—- D — as an expression of its genotype, though
perhaps it should now be D /D ; the fact that
the patient was homozygous in this peculiar respect was
due to the interrelationship of her parents who were half
second cousins. A similar chromosome deletion has been
reported from America in which the E locus was missing.
These deletions support strongly the presumed order
DCE ; and the evidence generally implies that the D site
is not as close to C as C is to E.
Recently evidence has arisen to suggest that another
locus exists for which the alleles have been called F and f.
The order is almost certainly DCEF. There is yet another
antigen whose place in the system is not yet clear—it may



T H E B h C O M P L E X 39
be part of a further pair of alleles, which have been called, temporarily, V and v ; V is common in negroes and rare in white persons. V and f have been identified, but the presumed v and F await discovery. One may picture, therefore, a short segment of chromosome upon which there are four, perhaps five, gene loci linearly disposed and very close together ; the first of the loci will carry D or d and the other three in order will carry C or e, E or e and F or f respectively. The R h blood group system might be described genetically as comprising four closely-linked and adjacent loci for which four pairs of alleles compete. This picture is a likely deduction rather than a proved fact ; and in due course V and v might be incorporated. The sequence of these observations, and the adoption of a notation using small and capital letters may give rise to an erroneous impression t h a t the normal number of alleles available for each gene locus is two. In fact there are more. There may be perhaps three or four variant forms of C, of which C and c may possibly represent the opposite extremes. These other alleles are distinguished
by superscript symbols, e.g. CM, Cv. These variants are of no great practical importance, but they are of sufficient interest in other respects to be worth a brief mention. The alleles at the C locus that are at present known are
caUed C, O , Cw, Cx, cv and c. Of these Cw is the only variant, apart from C and c, that is not rare. I t is called
Gw rather than QW because its properties are very similar
to C. The existence of anti-C10 antibodies (i.e. those
reacting with Cw but not with C or c) is well attested, and in one case at least this antibody has caused hsemolytic
disease of the newborn. Since both anti-C and anti-C10 are known, it would be reasonable to suppose that C and
Cw are distinct substances even though they are related.
But antibodies reacting with both C and Cw are common



40 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
and appear to arise from immunisation with C alone.
These antibodies are, for convenience, called anti-C + Cw9 but they do not appear to be mixtures of independent antibodies, for they cannot be separated by absorption (as, for example, a mixture of anti-C + anti-D can). This curious fact has been explained by supposing that the two antibody groupings are carried on the one molecule : but this view is capable of unjustifiable extension which might raise serious difficulties. I t might be wiser at
present to regard the difference between C and Cw as a slight chemical one so that most antibodies are capable of reacting effectively with both forms ; but that some antibodies are able to react only with C and others only with
Cw. Those antibodies t h a t react with both forms do so
more effectively with C than with Cw. The other alleles at this locus may be dealt with more
briefly. Cx is very rare and may be recognised by a specific
anti-C25 antibody and by some samples of anti-C. Cu may be regarded, for simplicity, as a rather weaker form of C ; it is recognised by some, but not all anti-C sera. The most
interesting perhaps is cv. It is agglutinated by some samples of anti-C and some of anti-c. I t may therefore be thought of as having certain components of both C and c. This forms a marked contrast with D antigens ; C and c may not be so very dissimilar if some of their properties
can be combined in GV, but D and d are so dissimilar t h a t the former is an antigen so powerful that it is responsible for hsemolytic disease of the newborn, whereas d is so weakly antigenic that its very existence has been questioned. The variation that occurs at the D locus seems to be constant in kind but different in degree. The variation takes the form of a rather weaker reaction to anti-D. To
be more precise, the variant cells, which are called Dw, react with some but not all anti-D sera and are discovered



T H E E h C O M P L E X 41
better by the antiglobulin reaction than by other tech
niques. DM could, at present, be regarded as a weaker
form of D, possibly due simply to there being fewer anti
gens on each red cell. Not all samples of T>u exhibit the
same degree of weakness, some being less reactive than
others ; the degree of weakness, however, seems to be
precisely inheritable. DM is rare but is important because
without adequate tests the DM could be missed and the
subject classed as d. This error could lead to the adminis
tration of DM blood to a d person with the result that the
recipient might form anti-D. A very rare experience,
which is less easy to explain is the formation of anti-D by
some DM persons. The alleles at the E locus are all rare (apart from E and
e) and do not display any points of principle different from
those at the other loci. Three have been discovered,
termed EM, Ew and e*. It is not intended that anything should be said here
about certain genetical aspects of these closely-linked loci
such as the effect of position on the expression of the genes
or the interference by some genes in the expression of
others, but there is one point of this kind which may prove
of considerable practical importance. There is some evi
dence that D is more antigenic when in the combination
DcE than in DCe. There is more than one possible
explanation for this, but its practical significance is that
Rh positive fathers having an E are more likely to im
munise their wives against D, and have more severely
affected babies, than those with C.
The question of compatibility for blood transfusion
needs further consideration in the light of these Rh com
plexes. The administration of D blood into a person lack
ing D is likely to give rise to antibody formation, whereas
the transfusion of d blood into a person lacking this antigen
is harmless. The transfusion of C or E blood into cc or ee
H.B.G. D



42 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
persons is also undesirable though neither of these sub
stances is as antigenic as D. Nor is administration of c or
e blood into CC or EE persons entirely without risk and
both anti-c and anti-e may be encountered, more parti
cularly the former. It follows that the administration of
rhesus negative blood (dce/dce) to rhesus positive persons
is potentially dangerous and should not be done ill
advisedly. For most practical purposes D is the antigen
that matters, but it is as well to bear in mind that the
other members of the Rh complex (except d) may occasion
ally give rise to antibody formation.



C H A P T E R VI
SOME MINOR GROUPS AND THEIR NOTATION
IN any rapidly expanding branch of science there is
always considerable difficulty and often confusion in try
ing to devise a system of nomenclature that can be
extended to incorporate later discoveries without invalida
ting the names invented to explain the earlier observa
tions ; and in trying to use names or symbols that reflect
the observed evidence with reasonable accuracy without
carrying unjustified implications about properties that
have not been tested or proved. Blood-group nomen
clature and notation have proved particularly trouble
some in this way. It will be seen that new knowledge has
already outgrown the inflexible nomenclature that was
originally adopted for the ABO and MN blood group
systems ; and in these only ingenious variation can be
employed in the hope of diminishing confusion. The Rh
system of nomenclature has been most ably devised and
ingeniously extended so as to allow of a simple grasp of
what could be a most complex assembly of antigens. Even
so there are difficulties ; the employment of capital and
small letters falsely implying a genetical dominance and
recessiveness is but one example, and there are others ;
what was first called CDE one would now like to call DCE,
the justification of thinking of Cw as a variant of C, when
it may be the other way round, or of using lower case for
cv when it may react with anti-C and having only one
symbol, DM, for several variants. These may not be thought serious defects, and their
appraisal is not intended as a commentary upon the
difference of opinion between Dr. Wiener and other experts
43 D 2



44 H U M A N B L O O D G B O U P S
concerning whether the DCE notation should be used at all, or instead a system of capital R's printed in various ways and attended by a number of superscript and subscript signs. As to this dispute, it is of no consequence to anyone but those who aspire to those intellectual levels at which it is conducted, and they may judge for themselves ; the rest may be content to adopt whichever system best stands the test of time. But the discovery of each new blood group raises essentially the same problem afresh and an attempt has been made to devise a system flexible enough to allow the necessary expansion, and yet reasonably consistent between one blood group system and another. Such a scheme may now be set out in its application to one blood group system as an example. The blood group Duffy is chosen. This group receives its name from the patient on whom investigations led to its discovery, and with his permission. It was not possible to use D or Du as shorthand symbols for this group because these or similar symbols were bespoken in the Rh system ; hence Fy was adopted. The differentiation of alleles by small and capital letters was
avoided and the symbols Fya and Fy& used instead. This has the advantage of not implying any dominance or other inequality between them, and a further 24 alleles could be discovered without embarrassing the notation by running out of superscript letters. The genes, then,
that can be inherited are Fya and Fyb, which may be
homozygous as in FyaFya or FybFyb, or heterozygous as
in FyaFy&. If an anti-Fya antibody alone is used to examine red cells the results are expressed thus, Fy(a + ) or Fy(a —), for all that this test could disclose is the
presence or absence of the antigen Fya. If it is present, Fy(a +)> one cannot say whether the cells are homozygous or heterozygous ; if it is absent, Fy(a —-), one has not



M I N O R G R O U P S A N D T H E I R N O T A T I O N 45
direct evidence that Fy& is present until the cells are
tested with anti-Fyb. When both antibodies are used the
results are expressed thus ; homozygous Fya cells would
be Fy(a + b —), but hétérozygotes, reacting with both
sera, would be Fy(a + b + ), and finally those cells react
ing only with anti-Fy& would be Fy(a — b +)·

referring to such information as is available about the
genetic structure with the means that are at the investi
gator's disposal. If he has only anti-Fya available and the
cells do not react with this, he can justifiably express the
result only as the phenotype Fy(a — ) ; as far as is at
present known the genotype of such a sample is likely to
be Fy&Fyb but without testing with anti-Fyb or investi
gating other members of the family one could not be sure
that there may not be an Fyc hitherto undiscovered.
Where family studies or other evidence can certainly
determine the genetic structure, then the term genotype
is used. In addition genes and antigens may be distinguished in
all groups by setting the symbols in italic when referring
to genes and in roman when referring to antigens.

The incidence of the F y a antigen is about 66 per cent.

is more antigenic than Fy&, because many Samples of
anti-Fya have been encountered but only a few of anti-Fyb.
Anti-Fya reacts poorly or not at all by direct agglutination or by the albumin or trypsin tests, but is effective if the antiglobulin test is used. A few transfusion reactions have been reported as due to this antibody. Most negroes
have neither Fya nor Fyft, but no antibody has yet been discovered that identifies a third allele at this locus.
LUTHERAN (discovered in 1946)
The short symbol for this group is Lu. Both anti-Lua
and anti-Lu& are rare and the group is not important medically.
K E L L (discovered in 1946)
The antigen K was discovered in Britain, and k was discovered independently in America, being at first called Celiano. (The names in most of these groups are taken from the patient in whom the antigen or antibody was first found.) The antigen k is almost universal, having an incidence of 99-8 per cent., and Kell positive people are nearly all heterozygous (i.e. K K is a very rare combination). A number of samples of both anti-K and anti-k are known ; either may cause hsemolytic disease of the newborn but the former is far the more dangerous. K is, in fact, quite a powerful antigen and this group must be reckoned with in clinical practice. The newly discovered
antibodies, anti-Kpa and anti-Kpb have disclosed two new antigens closely related to K and k.

cent Jka and 74 per cent. J k \
New blood groups are being discovered astonishingly
frequently. Some are so rare that no examples are found
outside the families of the patients in whom they were
first discovered. Others, after a period of independent
existence, are shown to be related to one of the existing
systems. Some recently discovered antigens whose pro
gress may be worth watching are Wra, Dia, Yta, Vel and
Js°.



CHAPTER VII
THE MNS SYSTEM
IT is at this stage that the reader may appreciate the
decision to present a summary of knowledge of human
blood groups in the order that has been selected. The
evidence that has been discussed so far about the sero
logical behaviour of blood group antigens and antibodies
has been consistent with the known properties of antigens
and antibodies generally, and such variations as have been
noted have been easy to comprehend and assess. Likewise
the inheritance ofblood-group antigens can be explained, on
the evidence so far presented, as dependent on a number of
allelic genes competing for certain chromosome loci, and
that in the Rh group there are three or four known loci
closely adjacent. It is again true to say that such few
variations from this simple interpretation as are known
do not seriously invalidate the basic concept. And for all
these phenomena a reasonable attempt has been made to
devise simple and, as far as possible, meaningful systems
of notation and nomenclature. But in turning now to
other blood groups, particularly those discovered before
the Rhesus factor, some additional complications arise
when recent discoveries have to be grafted on to an exist
ing notation. Of this the MNS system provides an example. The antigens M and N were first described in 1927, and
were discovered in experiments on rabbit antisera pre
pared against human cells ; however, human examples of
anti-M and anti-N are fully substantiated. M and N are
alleles for a single locus so that, as usual, one can find
homozygous persons, MM or NN, or heterozygous persons,
MN.
48



T H E M N S S Y S T E M 49
Variants of M and N are known (called M2 and N2)
and one, called Mc, is thought to be intermediate between
M and N (in much the same way as cv is thought to be
intermediate between C and c). A recently discovered
variant, called W, does not react with anti-M or anti-N. Twenty years later the discovery of a certain antiserum
led to the belief that there was another locus associated
with the MN one, for which the two alleles were called S
and s. This was confirmed in due course by the finding of
anti-s to complete the picture sketched by anti-S. These
two loci are close together so that cross-overs do not
separate them ; the situation is comparable to that
described for the Rh loci. It is far from convenient having
the alleles of one locus labelled with two different capital
letters (M and N) and those of the other locus distin
guished by capital and small forms of the same letter (S
and s), and the situation is worsened by the discovery of
a third allele at this locus called SM, which indicates lack
of S or s. The approximate incidences of these groups in
Britain are M 28 per cent, N 22 per cent., S 32 per cent, and
s 89 per cent. The only one of these antigens that seems
to be powerful enough to evoke antibody formation at all
commonly is S. One may summarise the position by
saying that there are two established loci in this system,
the alleles of one of which being M, N and rarely Ma and
of the other S, s and rarely SM. It is now necessary to find room for at least five new
antigens in this system. Two of these, Hunter (Hu) and
Henshaw (He) are more common in negroes than in white
people and seem to be associated closely with N, and in
the case of He, with S as well. The other two, Mia and
Vw, are closely associated with each other as well as with
MN and Ss. Of the latest, Vr, little is yet known.
This system is of very minor interest clinically, but it
does illustrate how confused blood group notation may



50 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
become. In 1927 it seemed as though the whole topic had
been finished by the demonstration of the two alleles M
and N ; and for twenty years this view, based on simple
agglutination reactions, was not assailed by any newly
accruing evidence. But now, more than thirty years later,
it has become a mass of arbitrary and, at first sight, un
related symbols. Admittedly many of them are but
temporary labels attached to the antigen until it can be
assigned to its appropriate place in the system and a con
venient and meaningful sign invoked. One may feel that
a revised notation for all blood groups is becoming pres
sing. Such a revision will not inconvenience the clinician
who encounters but a handful of these antigens in normal
practice ; and the expert will be intellectually gratified
and can always be furnished with a glossary. Perhaps the
greatest impediment to a revision of the notation is fear of
tackling the sacrosanct international nomenclature of the
ABO system.



CHAPTER VIII
THE ABO SYSTEM
ALTHOUGH the ABO blood groups were the first by
many years to be discovered and are the most important
of all groups clinically, they display such unusual features,
in comparison with other groups, that they are hardly a
suitable introduction to the topic in general. As early as
the year 1900 Karl Landsteiner showed that the human
race could be divided into several groups by the agglutina
tion reactions of red-blood cells, and these observations
were rounded off by two of his pupils two years later.
This is, perhaps, a convenient place to recall that Land
steiner, in addition to this great scientific contribution in
1900, discovered, with Levine, the M, N and P groups in
1927, and the Rh group, D, in 1940, this time with Wiener.
He would no doubt be astonished were he able to witness
the remarkable acceleration of blood-group discovery
during the last decade. The original observations at the beginning of the cen
tury showed that mankind could be divided into four
groups which could be explained by supposing the exis
tence of two different blood-group substances called A
and B. In one group were placed those carrying one of
these substances, A, on the red cells (Group A) and in the
second, those carrying the other (Group B). The third
group comprised those carrying both substances (Group
AB) and the last group those carrying neither (Group O).
A later discovery of a weaker variant of A, called A2,
increased the number of groups to six, viz., Av A2, B,
AiB, A2B and O.
The first peculiarity of the ABO system that merits
51



52 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
attention is the presence of natural antibodies. In all the
blood-group systems so far discussed it has been assumed
that no antibody will be present in a person's serum
unless that person lacks the antigen concerned and has
been subject to an antigenic stimulus that would provoke
the formation of antibody. Indeed, this is general sero
logical experience. But anti-A and anti-B arise spon
taneously, in the absence of proved antigenic stimulus,
during the first year of life. Of course the antibody does
not appear in those carrying the same antigen, so that
anti-A does not occur in persons who possess the A antigen,
and is thus found in all persons belonging to Group B and
Group 0 ; similarly anti-B occurs in persons of Group A
and Group O. The antibody anti-A commonly has two
components, which may be called anti-A and anti-A! ;
the former agglutinates all A cells whether Ax or A2 ; but
anti-A! agglutinates only Ax cells and may, indeed, be
found in persons of Group A2 or A2B. More will be said
later of the features of anti-A. In its simplest genetic form the ABO system may be
regarded as resulting from the inheritance from each
parent of one of four allelic genes at one locus, namely A1}
A2, B and O. Persons belonging to Group A1 may have
one of three possible antigenic combinations, A · ^ , AXA2,
or AxO ; and those belonging to group A2 may be either
A2A2 or A20. All that can be determined by the use of the
available antisera (anti-A and anti-Ax) is the phenotype,
i.e. A± or A2. To determine the genotype, for example
AXA2 or ΑχΟ, it may be necessary to test several members
of the family in the hope of deducing which genes are
being handed on. An example of such deduction of geno
types from family studies is taken from Race and Sanger's
book (pp. 19 and 20 of the third edition)—". . . in the first
family . . . it is clear from the blood groups of the two
elder children that each of the parents must possess an 0



T H E A B O S Y S T E M 53
gene. The father, therefore, is of the genotype BO and the mother Α20. In the second family the father and the girl twin are of the phenotype Av and without the evidence provided by the genotypes of the mother and the boy twin their genotypes could not have been ascertained. The boy has received B from his mother and A2 has come from his father, whose genotype must be A ^ g . The girl of the phenotype A± has no B and must therefore have received A2 from her mother ; the genotype of the girl twin is consequently Α-,Α^."

I n Britain the frequencies of these groups is A 44-7 per cent. (Ax 34-8 per cent, and A2 9-9 per cent.), B 8-6 per cent., AB 3-2 per cent. (AXB 2-6 per cent, and A2B 0-6 per cent.) and O 43-5 per cent.



54 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
A second peculiarity of the ABO system is that the anti
genic substances A and B are found not only in the red
cells but in the tissue cells and plasma as well ; moreover
they are also secreted in the bodily secretions, such as
saliva. But the formation of these blood-group substances
on the cells and in the secretions is governed by a number
of independently acting genes. One of these genes, called
X, is necessary for the development of the B antigen both
on the cells and in the secretions (it may also influence the
A antigen, but of this we have no evidence). The lack of
the X gene (i.e. inheritence of xx) thus causes failure of
development of the B antigen in persons known to have
received a B gene. The second gene, Y, influences the development of the
A antigen (but does not concern B) on the cells, but it
does not modify the secretion of the A antigen. Therefore
persons inheriting an A gene but lacking the Y gene are
able to secrete it in their saliva, but do not seem able to
put the A antigen on to their cells. The third gene is the
secretor gene Se. About 76 per cent, of Europeans are
either SeSe or Sese and can secrete the A and B substances
in the saliva and bodily secretions, but those lacking Se
(i.e. sese) can put the A and B antigens on their cells,
without being able to secrete them.
By way of summary, therefore, there are, in addition
to the genes responsible for the inheritance of the A and B
substances, genes controlling the development of these
substances on the cell and in the secretions. Without X
(either in the homozygous or heterozygous state) a person
cannot develop the B antigen on his cells or in his secre
tions, despite his having received the B gene. Without Y,
the A antigen will not develop on the cells but may appear
in the secretions, depending upon the presence of the Se
gene which is necessary if these blood-group substances are
to appear in the secretions.



T H E A B O S Y S T E M 55
It is as well at this stage to consider the gene 0 , a topic so obscure that it is almost impossible to say anything sensible about it. Persons of genetype 0 0 must presumably inherit a gene of some kind even though all t h a t can be said about it is that it is not A or B. The inheritance of the 0 gene does not lead to the development of an antigen t h a t can provoke the formation of a specific antibody (i.e. one that agglutinates AO cells as well as 0 0 cells). Yet a number of antisera are known t h a t do agglutinate Group O cells but not those of Groups Ax or B ; they usually also agglutinate cells of Group A2. The source of most of these sera is not a human one and yet a few samples of human sera have been described t h a t have these properties. One positive observation about these antisera has led to their being divided into two kinds ; some of them are not neutralised by the addition of saliva from a secretor person of whatever group, and these are called anti-0 sera. The others are neutralised by saliva from secretors irrespective of their group and these are called anti-H. One may picture the situation thus. Secretors have the H substance on their red cells whichever group they belong to, but it is, to some extent, superseded by the A and B substances when these are present. Hence anti-H sera do not agglutinate Group A or Group B cells, but are capable of agglutinating Group A2 or Group O cells. Nevertheless there is sufficient H substance in the secretions of persons of all groups (if they are secretors) to neutralise anti-H. Non-secretors (sese) do not secrete H, though they have it on their cells. Probably the only people who do not have H on their cells are those lacking the gene X, and the first of such persons to be described (the " Bombay " type) had anti-H in the serum. It is thus customary to refer to three genes, A, B and 0, though the existence of the third gene as an entity t h a t is



56 H U M A N B L O O D G E O U P S
something more than mere absence of A and B has not been proven. It is customary also to refer to three antigens A, B and H, the last probably being present in all cells though most manifest in those of Group O and only a little less so in those of Group A2. Group O and Group A2 cells may be agglutinated by certain antisera some of which are called anti-H (for they are neutralised by saliva from secretors) and the others, not so neutralised, are called anti-O. This account carefully evades any explicit statement about the relationship between the gene O and the antigen H. From what has been said about H and 0 it may be realised t h a t the relationship of Ax to A2 cannot easily be defined ; genetically they are alleles but serologically their relationship is obscure and it cannot unequivocably be classed as qualitative or quantitative. There are also a number of weaker forms of A of which A3 is the best established. The B antigen also has certain weaker variants of no clinical importance, but a recent observation concerning this antigen is of interest. I t has been shown that in some elderly sick patients who are not of Group B, a B-like antigen may be acquired temporarily on their cells. These cells in this state react with anti-B sera, but not with the patient's own anti-B antibodies. This matter awaits further enquiry. The A and B antigens also appear weaker at birth and during the first few weeks of life.
T H E ANTIBODIES OF THE ABO SYSTEM
I t has already been mentioned t h a t a peculiarity of the ABO system is the natural presence of anti-A and of anti-B in persons not possessing the corresponding antigen. It was no doubt the presence of these antibodies t h a t led to the ABO blood groups' being the first to be discovered. I t is also because of the existence of these antibodies t h a t



T H E A B O S Y S T E M 57
the ABO groups are more important in blood transfusion
than are other blood groups. A single bottle of blood in
compatible for A or B is likely to cause immediate trouble
because the recipient has antibodies already present ; in
other groups the antibodies have to be manufactured and
difficulties may develop more slowly. Anti-A and anti-B are weak or absent at birth, but make
their appearance after a few months ; they reach their
maximum strength by ten years of age. It is difficult to
account for the natural occurrence of anti-A or anti-B in
the sera of persons not possessing the corresponding anti
gen. Discussion has treated more fully the reason why
anti-A or anti-B is absent from persons who do possess
the corresponding antigen. It seems that if the foetal
tissues encounter in utero any potentially antigenic sub
stance, that substance comes to be regarded as a natural
component of the foetus and hence not " foreign " and not
antigenic. It has been suggested that the antibody
forming apparatus in foetal life is learning to recognise,
perhaps by codes, the foetal tissues themselves, including
the blood-group substances, so that antibodies are not
produced by an organism against its own tissues. Indeed
an animal may be rendered unable to produce antibodies
in adult life against substances introduced to it in foetal
life, a state called " immunological tolerance." Immuno
logical tolerance, therefore, develops to the A or B antigen
inherited by the foetus, and the natural antibodies appear
only in the absence of the corresponding antigen. But
why they appear at all has never been explained. These natural antibodies (as they are called, but they
may not be natural and are certainly unusual as antibodies)
do not readily pass from mother to foetus in utero, and do
not give rise to hsemolytic disease of the newborn. There
are, however, circumstances in which the properties of
anti-A or anti-B may alter, and these changes result from
H.B.G. E



58 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
immunisation of the patient by the A or B substances (i.e. by injection or transfusion of blood or blood products containing an antigen against which the patient already possesses a naturally-occurring antibody). It also appears t h a t certain other vaccines (e.g. anti-tetanus inoculation) may bring about this change of character of anti-A or antiB. The antibodies displaying these new properties are referred to as " immune " anti-A or anti-B and differ from their naturally-occurring counterparts in three important ways (and several minor ways). First, their in vitro activity is greater at body-heat than at room temperature ; (the reverse is true of the naturally-occurring antibodies which in this respect are unusual serologically). Secondly, they are capable of hsemolysing the appropriate cells in vitro, whereas the natural antibodies can do no more than agglutinate. Finally, the immune forms of anti-A and antiB may reach the foetus in utero and destroy fœtal cells ; they may thus be a cause of hsemolytic disease of the newborn. Although it has been customary to refer to these antibodies as " immune " and " naturally-occurring " it has been shown that there is a difference of specificity. The immune form of anti-A which haemolyses human A cells will also react with pig red cells of Group A, but the natural antibody does not. Moreover, pig group A cells can absorb the immune anti-A from an antiserum without altering the titre of the natural form. Hence it appears that a part of the human A antigen is also found in pig cells of Group A, and it is against this part t h a t the immune anti-A is directed ; the other part of the human A antigen, which is not found in pig cells, is recognised by the natural form of anti-A. The forms of antibody can thus be summarised : first, anti-AjL, a naturally-occurring room-temperature agglutinating antibody, specific for human Ax cells. Second,



T H E A B O S Y S T E M 59
anti-A, also a naturally-occurring room-temperature agglutinating antibody reacting with human Ax and A2
cells. Third, anti-Ap an immune, body-temperature hsemolysing antibody reacting with human and pig Group A cells. Less is known about anti-B. There is reason to suppose that when anti-A and anti-B occur together in the same person (i.e. in Group O) their properties differ slightly from those when they are separate (as in Group A or Group B persons), or when artificially mixed from persons of the latter groups. I n Group 0 sera there is some cross-absorption, i.e. some anti-B seems to be absorbed by A cells and vice versa, almost as if there were some antigenic component common to both groups and recognised by the sera of Group O persons, or some Group O persons, alone. I t is also of interest, and may be rele vant, t h a t the immune forms of anti-A or anti-B giving rise to hsemolytic disease of the newborn seem to arise far more commonly in mothers of Group O than in those of Group A or B. Neither of these observations has yet been satisfactorily explained.
HiEMOLYTic D I S E A S E OF THE NEWBORN
Hsemolytic disease due to A or B differs in certain respects from the condition, already described, that results from Rh immunisation. Clinically there are no very great differences, though the disease due to anti-A or anti-B is usually milder (but it can be severe) and in its mild form may be quite common. Though the mechanism by which this disease comes about in ABO immunisation is not understood it clearly differs from that due to R h immunisation. The naturally-occurring anti-A and anti-B do not seem to play much part, if any, in this disorder, and it is the formation of immune anti-A or B that causes trouble. The formation of these immune antibodies occurs very many times more frequently in Group O mothers
Έ2



60 H U M A N B L O O D G B O U P S
than in those of Groups A or B. And there is no evidence t h a t the immunising agent is an invasion of fœtal red cells following retro-placental haemorrhage ; it is more likely to be the soluble blood group substance of the foetus. Nor is parturition essential to the establishment of maternal immunisation and so first-born infants may be affected. Both secretor and non-secretor infants are liable. The antiglobulin test (or Coombs test) is a certain means of diagnosis of hsemolytic disease of all forms except t h a t due to anti-A or anti-B. In all major respects other than those mentioned the disease is comparable, whether provoked by anti-D or anti-A or anti-B.
INCOMPATIBLE TRANSFUSION
The existence of the natural forms of anti-A and anti-B imposes a very strict practice upon blood transfusion if incompatibility and its consequences are to be avoided. I t is most important to ensure that no red cells enter the circulation of a patient who carries an antibody against these cells. The most important antibodies to be ascertained and guarded against are anti-A and anti-B. If blood of Group A is infused into a person who carries anti-A the incoming cells will be rapidly destroyed by the patient's antibody. I t is the destruction of transfused cells that constitutes the danger to the patient, for the disposal of such a large number of cells so rapidly cannot be accomplished without damage to the kidney which can, in severe cases, lead to death from the consequences of anuria. I t is necessary, therefore, always to administer blood of the same group as the patient's whenever this can be achieved. Normally this is accomplished in two stages. Firstly the ABO group of the patient is determined so t h a t blood of the same group can be made available. Secondly, a " cross-match " is performed before the transfusion.



T H E A B O S Y S T E M 61
For this purpose some of the patient's serum is obtained and exposed to some cells from the particular sample of blood to be administered. This is to ensure that no antibodies are present in the patient's serum that would react with, and hence destroy, the transfused blood. This procedure is designed to cover all blood-group antibodies, not merely anti-A or anti-B, and it may be necessary, if the patient is thought to have antibody in the incomplete form, to perform the cross-match by some technique designed to reveal this form of antibody such as the albumin test or the antiglobulin test. In no circumstances should these two steps be omitted, and they should always be performed by a trained person in a properly-equipped laboratory ; bedside cross-matches can no longer be considered safe. These steps provide against incompatible transfusion concerning anti-A, anti-B or other preformed antibodies in the patient, but they are not enough. I t is necessary to ensure that the patient is not likely to become immunised by the proposed transfusion against blood-group antigens other than A or B. Of these the only one t h a t is taken into account in routine transfusion is the Rh antigen D which is the most powerful, and hence the most troublesome, of the other blood-group antigens. For these reasons, and particularly because of the risk of subsequent hsemolytic disease in the children of female patients, it is essential to determine the Rh group (D or d) of the patient so that Rh compatible blood is administered. Neither of the first procedures given above ensures this. To summarise, therefore : every patient requiring transfusion should have his cells examined for the antigens A, B and D. Blood of corresponding group should then be selected and a cross-match performed before it is administered. This represents the minimum safeguard which must be made available to every patient. Some patients



62 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
require further careful and detailed preparation, for example those likely to receive repeated transfusions or otherwise suspected of an unusual predisposition to manufacture antibodies. It is important that the idea does not gain ground that much of this preparation can be circumvented by administering blood of Group O dd indiscriminately. There are many reasons for this, of which a practical one is the difficulty the blood transfusion service would encounter in trying to meet a large demand for this far from common type of blood. But there is another reason which is worth comment. Incompatible transfusion has been described as the infusion of red cells containing an antigen against which the patient carries an antibody. It may be asked whether the infusion of antibodies into a patient carrying the corresponding antigen would also be dangerous ; these circumstances would arise if Group 0 blood (containing anti-A and anti-B) were given to someone of Group A, B or AB. Normally no ill-effects follow such a procedure, partly because the antibody is so diluted in the larger volume of the recipient's circulation that very few of the patient's red cells would be destroyed, but also because the incoming antibody would be neutralised by the soluble blood-group substances in the plasma. There are, however, rare occasions when Group O blood contains anti-A or anti-B in such high titre t h a t its effect might be damaging to the patient's cells, particularly if the antibody is of the immune type. These rare samples are unsatisfactory for transfusion and have been called " dangerous universal donor " blood, a term that is now not very useful since the term " universal donor " has rightly been discarded. The initials " dud " might be retained, however. It might be argued that in emergency when there may be no time or facilities for proper blood grouping of the patient, the administration of Group 0 dd blood might be



T H E A B O S Y S T E M 63
justified. This argument is not strong. In the first place
facilities for accurate blood grouping should always be
available, day or night, wherever blood for transfusion is
itself available. And as for time, there can be very few
emergencies in which there is insufficient time, say half
an hour, for the determination of blood group and cross
match ; and most of these could be met by an initial
infusion of some cell-free fluid such as plasma or dextran,
while the blood-group work was being undertaken. The
administration of blood of correct ABO and Rh group
should be invariable in all cases requiring transfusion.



CHAPTER IX
P AND LEWIS
THE two remaining blood-group systems have been left
till last because an appreciation of their properties depends
on a knowledge of the ABO groups. The first of them, the
P group, can be disposed of briefly. P was discovered in
1927, and, after the discovery in 1951 of the Jay system
(short symbol Tja), it proved that they were related. It
seems that the system is analagous to the ABO system
and, by discarding the Tj notation, the P notation may be
modelled on the ABO group as follows. Those who have no P antigen, who may be referred to
as pp, are analagous to Group O and have the naturally
occurring antibodies anti-P and anti-P! in their serum
(just as Group 0 persons have anti-A and anti-A-,^ in the
serum). Such persons are extremely rare, indeed at present
only fifteen are known in the world. Those who carry the
P antigen may have it in one of two forms, Pj or P2, just
as Group A persons have Ax or A2. Those belong to the
subgroup Px (nearly 80 per cent, of persons in Europe)
have no naturally-occurring anti-P in the serum, but
those who are P 2 may have anti-P! (just as some A2
persons have anti-A!). Another antigen has recently been
discovered in this system, called P*.
The other blood-group system, called Lewis, displays a
number of interesting features that are not found in other
blood groups. It seems that two antigens can be recog
nised, called Lea and Left, but about 6 per cent, of persons
carry neither of these antigens. The incidence in adults of
Lea is about 22 per cent, and of Le& is 72 per cent.; the
incidence of Lea is higher in children because children's
64

cells heterozygous for Lea are agglutinated but those from adults are not ; this unusual situation has not yet been explained. The most notable feature about the Lewis group is a property that has not been found in any other human blood group, but is known in the J group in cattle and the R group in sheep. This is that the red cells are not furnished with the antigen directly but they absorb it from the plasma. This can also be accomplished in vitro ; cells
lacking Lea will become Lea positive after exposure to
plasma containing Lea ; and the same can be shown for
Le6. Newborn infants lack the Lewis antigens at birth, but a few weeks later the antigens appear in the plasma and are absorbed on the cells. The genes that govern the development of these Lewis antigens, therefore, do not equip the red cells with the antigen but provide for its appearance in the plasma and in the bodily secretions such as saliva. The red cells then absorb the antigen on to their surface from the plasma in which, nevertheless, a good deal remains. This genetical control of the secretion of blood-group substances into the plasma and saliva recalls the secretion of the A, B and H substances and there is a connection, though the genes governing Lewis secretion are not the same as those governing ABH secretion. A theory that meets most of the observed facts depends upon the premise that there is not usually enough soluble blood-group substance to provide an adequate amount of both ABH
and Lea antigen in the same person. Therefore a person
carrying both the ABH secretor gene (Se) and the Lea secretor gene (called L) cannot produce both substances and the ABH enjoys the preference. In other words,
secretors of ABH are all Leb. (If there were any surplus
Lea substance available in such persons it seems to go into the saliva and not the plasma, and hence not the red cells.)



66 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
Non-secretors of ABH (sese), on the other hand, leave plenty of soluble blood-group substance to be made into
Lea in persons possessing the Lewis secretor gene L, and
all such persons are Lea. Those who do not carry the Lewis secretor gene L are the 6 per cent, who are neither
Lea or Leb. Possibly Table VI may help in appreciating these points, though it should be understood that much of this view is still speculative.

This theory seems to leave Le& in a rather anomalous position at present and it has even been suggested that
there may be no Le6 gene. Anti-Leb sera, too, display
some curious features. Some of them agglutinate Leb cells of Group A2 or 0 but not those of Group A1# This could be explained by suggesting that the A antigen may have used so much of the material available for the manufacture of soluble substance that there is a shortage not only of
Lea but also of Leb in the plasma for red cells to absorb ;
the shortage would not diminish the amount of Leb in the
saliva, and anti-Leb sera of this type are all neutralised by the saliva of ABH secretors. But the other form of anti
Leb, though more normal serologically, does not fit into
this pattern. This latter agglutinates all Leb-containing cells irrespective of ABO group.



CHAPTER X
BLOOD GROUPS AND DISEASE
THE relationship of blood groups to haemolytic disease
of the newborn and to incompatible blood transfusion has
already been discussed. These are the two principal ways
in which blood groups can be a direct cause of disease :
and of disease which is in large measure preventable.
There are other ways, however, in which blood groups
appear to be related to certain diseases though the
mechanisms of the relationship are obscure. At present
the means of enquiry into these matters is statistical. Naturally the known relationship of blood groups to
haemolytic disease of the newborn has led to an examination
of the possible role of blood groups in other forms of failure
to bring pregnancy to full term, abortions and mis
carriages, toxaemia of pregnancy and similar conditions,
but without convincing association being demonstrated. Another group of diseases that has been studied in this
respect is disorder of the upper part of the intestinal tract,
peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and pernicious ansemia. It
must be remembered that the soluble blood group sub
stances are secreted from the gastric mucosa (which is
affected in these disorders) as well as from the salivary
glands which have also been studied with this in mind.
In all these disorders an association with blood groups has
been revealed.
Disease of the stomach and duodenum occupies the
central place. Peptic ulcération of all kinds is significantly
commoner in persons of Group O, both in many parts of
Europe and in widely-scattered parts of the world. The
association is even more pronounced with duodenal ulcer
67



68 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
than with gastric ulcer. It is also clear that ulcération is much commoner in non-secretors of the ABO blood group substances ; it is probably more common in those whose gastric HC1 secretion is promoted by histamine. There are no means at present of interpreting these results, but one cannot help wondering if the secretion into the stomach of the A or B substance may not afford some protection against peptic ulcération—particularly of the duodenum. This view is no more than guess-work. Two other diseases of the stomach show a different association ; they are cancer of the stomach and pernicious anaemia (true pernicious ansemia arising primarily from atrophy of the gastric mucosa). Both of these conditions are commoner in persons of Group A though the secretor status of sufferers from these disorders has not yet been determined. I t may be t h a t the actual site of the gastric lesion (both with ulcération and cancer) is more particularly related to blood group influences and this, to be speculative again, may be concerned with the distribution of secretory activity in different parts of the stomach. I t has been suggested that Group A predominates in both cancers and ulcers when the lesion is in the antrum and that Group 0 predominates when the lesion is in the body ; if this were so the association of cancer with Group A and ulcers with Group O may merely reflect the higher incidence of cancers in the antrum and ulcers in the body. Another form of tumour in a tissue of the upper alimentary tract that secretes blood group substance has also been shown to be commoner in Group A, namely salivary gland tumours. One further condition that has been found to be commoner in persons of Group A also concerns a gland in the upper alimentary tract, but in the endocrine portion of it, so the question of secretion of the blood-group substances does not seem to be relevant. This condition is diabetes



B L O O D G B O U P S A N D D I S E A S E 69
mellitus, a genetical predisposition to which has long been
suspected.
There are other disorders in which an association with
blood groups is suspected and there is little doubt that
still more will be found and confirmed. There are, too, a
number of diseases which can be shown not to be related
to blood groups ; this is true of cancers of colon, rectum,
lung and breast, of toxaemia of pregnancy and hyperten
sion. All these studies relate to the ABO system, and
despite several investigations no disorder, other than
haemolytic disease, has been shown to be related to Rh
groups. There are, finally, two other forms of disorder which
display certain features relating to blood-group matters
and which may provide useful evidence in future investi
gations. One of these is acquired haemolytic anaemia in
some forms of which an antibody active against the
patient's own cells has been demonstrated. In some of
these cases the antibody has been shown to be directed
against a known antigen, such as the e antigen of the Rh
system. The other form of disorder is systemic lupus ery
thematosus, and like conditions in which, it has been sug
gested, the patient may be more readily able to manufac
ture blood-group antibodies than is normal. There is also evidence that very rarely the reactivity
of the A or B antigens may be modified by serious disease.
The temporary acquisition of a weak B-like antigen in sick
or aged persons not of this group has already been men
tioned. In other cases of severe bone marrow disease
(myeloid leukaemia and hypoplastic anaemia) the A antigen
on the cells has been found to be diminished in reactivity
with specific antisera.



C H A P T E R XI
BLOOD GROUPS AND GENETICS
T H E study of human inheritance is rendered difficult by two sets of circumstances. Firstly, the number of generations available for study can only be few and the size of families often small ; there is no means of evading this problem at present. Second, many heritable characteristics are determined by complexes of genes which may be difficult to analyse. In the study of blood groups, however, the geneticist has a tool that is remarkably free from the latter disadvantage. The usefulness of blood groups in genetical investigation is due to several features. It seems that in nearly every case the influence of a single gene determines one discernible effect, namely the development of a blood-group antigen. Moreover, there appears to be a minimal amount of extraneous interference with the power of the gene to bring about its effect, either from other genes situated nearby on the same chromosome, or from environmental factors generally. The study of blood-group antigens is therefore a very direct form of study of gene action. A large number of blood groups are now known, and so, since there are but 23 pairs of chromosomes in man, it may soon be possible to learn something about the positioning of these genes on the chromosomes and hence use them as markers to map out the site of other heritable characters. Already, blood-group studies have furnished much information about mechanisms of inheritance. The concept of closely-linked adjacent loci found in the Rh and MNS
70



B L O O D G R O U P S A N D G E N E T I C S 71
systems is of fundamental interest and allows further consideration of cross-overs and their frequency. And the deletion of part of the chromosome, resulting in the D character, throws further light on genetical mechanisms. Again, the recent accumulation of knowledge about the secretor genes has enlightened our views about gene action and the organisation of basic material available to receive the imprint of the gene. There are other genetical phenomena which may be illuminated by further investigation of blood groups. The forms of interference in the expression of genes by the effect of neighbouring genes, or other mechanisms of modification of gene expression, will no doubt find examples in blood groups. The effect, too, of blood groups and disease on the community will merit much study. If common diseases tend to diminish the survival of persons of certain groups a gradual change in blood-group frequencies would be expected if there were no compensating mechanism. The comprehension of such compensation would be a material contribution to the study of genetics. A start has been made on the search for linkage between blood-group genes and other heritable characters. It seems quite clear that none of the existing blood groups is linked (i.e. carried nearby on the same chromosome) with any other blood group or with the sex character. These blood-group genes, therefore, represent the first reference points on what one day may become a map of gene positions on each chromosome. So far only three linkages with blood-group characters have been detected ; they are : (a) an association between the Lutheran gene and secretor genes ; (6) one between the R h genes and t h a t determining the production of oval red cells ; and (c) between the ABO genes and a rare condition, the nail-patella syndrome. Many more such linkages are to be expected. There are,



72 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
too, other heritable characters that might assist in mapping the chromosomes, such as the ability to taste phenylthio-carbamide, the form of haemoglobin and haptoglobin and the presence of certain substances in the serum or in the urine. Knowledge of blood-group inheritance now permits the use of blood groups in problems of identity or disputed parentage. So long as the tests are adequately performed by an experienced worker there is no doubt whatever that incontrovertible evidence can be made available. If a child possesses a blood group not present in its reputed parents, then one of them has not engendered the child. I t is this negative process of excluding parentage t h a t is the most valuable contribution that blood groups can make ; and each additional blood-group system that is employed increases the chances that evidence could be made available that would exonerate a man wrongfully accused of paternity, as the following table, modified from Race and Sanger, shows :

Thus nearly 60 per cent, of falsely accused men could be exonerated if the alleged parents and the child were blood



B L O O D G R O U P S A N D G E N E T I C S 73
grouped by all these systems ; and possibly this figure could be raised by employing other characters such as secretion. These investigations rarely achieve positive evidence of parentage, but even this might on occasions be possible if a rare combination of blood groups was concerned. There are less litigious uses of blood groups, however, in identifying babies that might have become attached to the wrong mothers in a maternity unit, or in distinguishing identical (monozygotic) twins, whose blood groups would be identical, from dizygotic twins whose blood groups would be likely to differ. A discovery of the greatest interest t h a t has been made about twins in recent times concerns the so-called chimeras. It has been known for some time that most dizygotic cattle twins have not completely separate placentas, with the consequence that the twins share some embryonic tissues between them in varying proportions. Hence some tissues destined for one twin become implanted in the other and develop successfully, and vice versa. Each twin, therefore, carries two sets of blood-group antigens, and, in the case of heifers, the endocrine mix-up results in sterility, the animal being termed a freemartin. Freemartins have not been observed in the human species, but cases of dizygotic twins with double blood-group systems have been reported, and called chimeras. The following list gives the blood groups of the twins concerned in the first chimera to be discovered. The list on the left comprises the blood-group inheritance of the patient examined ; t h a t on the right of the twin who had died twenty-five years before the investigation ; hence the groups are determined from the surviving twin, some 40 per cent, of her cells being, in effect, derived from primitive hsemopoietic tissue destined for her brother but implanted in her during embryonic life. The differences are confined to the ABO, Kell and Kidd systems.

One of the features of interest in chimeras is the demon stration of " immunological tolerance." If foreign tissue becomes implanted in the embryo it becomes absorbed into the embryo as part of itself so that, in later life, when the foreign substance is again encountered, it is no longer recognised as foreign and antibodies are not made against it. The group 0 person above did not have any anti-A in the serum because of the implantation of A tissue in em bryonic life. One would expect, therefore, that homografts between chimera twins would take despite the genetical dissimilarity, and this has been tried—successfully, so far—on one of the two pairs of chimera twins reported after the one described above.



C H A P T E R XII
BLOOD GROUPS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
THE observations in the last chapter concerning human blood-group genetics, together with those of the preceding chapter concerning the relationship of blood groups to disease, lead to a consideration of whether blood groups can contribute to the study of mankind. These genetic markers may be expected to remain fairly constant in isolated breeding groups, except for the influence of disease on survival and fertility and hence on the composition of the population. If the various races or population masses of the world differ in their blood-group distribution it might be t h a t blood-group studies in different parts of t h e world would throw some light on the history of man.
It is certainly true that blood-group distribution varies very widely from one part of the world to another, and a start has been made to estimate blood-group frequencies the world over. No time should be lost in making the survey as widespread and as detailed as possible, for modern conditions tend to the dispersal of what may well have been static or at least exclusive breeding groups over many hundreds of years. In Europe, for example, some very rough distinctions emerge from the mass of data already accumulated. An arbitrary division following approximately the Iron Curtain leaves a very high incidence of B ( 10 per cent, or more) to the east but a high incidence of A to the west. A is particularly high in the Alpine region which may represent the cradle of one of the prehistoric groups of European settlers which later peopled the continent and is represented in Britain by Nordic immigrants. The successive
75 F 2



76 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
waves of invaders falling on the rich and accessible south and east of these islands is today reflected by a higher incidence of Group A in these regions (cf. Sussex, 29 per cent., parts of Scotland 20-21 per cent.). And the mountainous refuges of the retreating Celts and Britons is reflected in a higher incidence of Group 0 detectable throughout a broad peripheral arc stretching from North Wales, and Ireland, through Scotland and its Western Islands to Iceland (cf. North Wales 68-72 per cent., Kent 64 per cent.). The blood-group analysis of even smaller areas yields results of interest. I n Wales, for example, in addition to the Celtic legacy of high 0 there may be detected a high B component in some areas where collateral evidence would support the view that this represents a contribution from another ancient race. An unexpected area of high A on the Pembroke peninsular coincides with a known Viking settlement. Northern Europe poses many historical problems. The Celtic distribution of blood groups in Iceland questions the fate of the later Scandinavian invasions of this island. The Lapps also are evidently racially distinct, for their Eskimo neighbours do not share their high incidence of Group A2, nor their Russian neighbours their low M. Another distinctive race of interest is that of the Basques in the Pyrenees. This isolated community does not speak an Indo-European language and may, therefore, represent a stock established in Europe before the arrival of the earliest known Aryan hordes from the east. Their bloodgroup pattern supports this view, for their high 0 and low B differs from other invading groups, and in particular the incidence of d is higher among the Basques than anywhere else in the world. The gene d, being less common than D, is slowly being eliminated from all populations by the effect of haemolytic disease of the newborn which



B L O O D G R O U P S A N D A N T H R O P O L O G Y 77
threatens only hétérozygotes (Dd) ; though there may be some compensatory genetic trend. The high O and low B of the Basques contrasts with the great tongues of low incidence of 0 and high B radiating from the Caspian Sea which may represent the routes of invasion by the Asiatic peoples into Europe during the last two thousand years. The limit of their effective penetration is marked by the sharp decline of the incidence of B from 10 per cent, to the west of a line running south from the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea along part of the river Elbe to the head of the Adriatic Sea. The high B is also characteristic of the Balkan peoples (except Greeks) and is found in the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt. The Mediterranean basin, representing as it does the melting pot of many civilisations over many hundreds of years, shows a complex picture as might be expected. There is undoubtedly a contribution from the north European peoples with high A and fairly high B ; and also from the Basque progenitors with high 0 and d and low B. There is also a most distinctive component represented at this time by Sardinian stock who have a low incidence of A, B and d, together with a high M. Finally, there is a negro component bringing the specific Rh
combination Dee and possibly the gene DM. It is to the land bridges into this basin from the south and east that one must look for migratory evidence ; unfortunately, in Turkey and the Levant the data are as yet incomplete. In Egypt a picture broadly intermediate between the Mediterranean example of Sardinia and the African findings can be detected. Indeed if the R h groups alone are compared a surprisingly constant fall of D and
Dw together with a rise in C can be observed in passing from East Africa via Egypt to Sardinia. This picture implies a passage of negro peoples along the Nile valley



78 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
towards the Mediterranean, but the analysis of other blood groups shows this to be only a part of the story. In Cyprus the distinctive origin of the Greek-speaking and Turkishspeaking elements is not substantiated by blood groups. The Sahara desert is shown to have been an effective barrier between the peoples of the Mediterranean littoral and the inhabitants of the rest of the African continent. Though the various African tribes display smaller differences between themselves, the peoples of this continent are as a whole characterised by a high incidence of Dee, P
and J k a and a low one of S and Fya. In addition, certain antigens are found almost exclusively in African peoples ;
SM, He and H u of the MNS system, and a recently dis
covered antigen Jsa. The detailed observations of blood-group incidence elsewhere in the world show much complexity. In Asia the B gene shows a very high incidence, and in the south a high M is also found. Both of these genes show a fall as one passes towards the east, the B gradually (so t h a t it is absent from Australian aborigines and very low in the Maori), the M suddenly, along Wallace's line, to be replaced to the eastward by a high incidence of N. In the extreme
east, in China, A2, d and P have disappeared but Fya is
high. A recently discovered antigen, Diego (Dia) seems to be characteristic of Mongoloid races. Several distinctive populations have been studied such as the Australian aborigines (who have no B and very little S), the Ainu who differ markedly from their Japanese neighbours, and the Polynesians whose relationship with American aboriginal peoples betrays a common origin which is not inconsistent with Heyerdahl's theories ; though the blood-group evidence does not identify the first location of these peoples. The blood groups of Indians of the American continent very strongly suggest an Asiatic origin.



CHAPTER XIII
SOME GROWING POINTS
THE specialised techniques needed to investigate the chemical composition of blood-group antigens marks out this study as one distinct from the general run of blood group research. For the purposes of chemical analysis the blood-group substances concerned may be obtained from erythrocytes, from hog gastric mucosa or from certain bodily secretions, notably human ovarian cyst fluid. Hitherto the antigens most closely studied have been A,
B, H and Lea. They appear to contain carbohydrate and polypeptide as part of the same molecule. The carbohydrate moiety comprises four sugars, D-galactose, L-fucose, D-glucosamine and D-galactosamine. In the polypeptide moiety at least eleven amino acids have been identified. The specificity of the substance appears to reside in the carbohydrate portion of the molecule and certain sugars have been shown to be of critical importance in the specificity of the four blood-group substances studied.
These blood-group substances appear in the human body in two forms. Those in the plasma and secretions are water-soluble whereas those on the cells are ethanol soluble. Attempts are being made to discover whether the latter form can be found on cells other than red cells. As far as blood cells are concerned it seems clear that the A and B antigens are demonstrable on leucocytes and platelets, but the Rh antigens have not been so clearly demonstrated ; a claim to have detected the D antigen on leucocytes and platelets has been advanced, but it has not so far been supported by the use of alternative techniques. It is possible that P is present on leucocytes and platelets
79



80 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
(but not on tissue cells) but the Lutheran and Lewis antigens have not been found. If the MN antigens are present on leucocytes and platelets they appear to be in a form rather different from that on the red cells. As far as tissue cells are concerned the A and B substances are certainly present on epidermal cells and on spermatozoa. Traces of the A and B substances have been found in many tissues and relatively high concentrations, particularly in secretors, have been demonstrated in the gastric and duodenal mucosa by means of the fluorescent antibody technique. I n addition to determining the composition of blood group antigens, their situation on the red-cell envelope is also of interest. Each antigen appears to be scattered thinly over the surface disposed in a number of sites. I t has been estimated that there are between 2,000 and 5,000 such sites for the Rh antigen D on each red cell ; and many times more for the A antigen. The accessibility of these sites to antibody has never been seriously questioned in human blood groups, but there is evidence in other species that some antigens may not be situated on the outer surface of the cell. The activity of blood-group antibodies has been the subject of as close an enquiry as has been applied to antigens. The belief that all antibodies are to be found in the gamma fraction of serum globulin has recently been called into question. It has been suggested that though most blood-group antibodies are gamma globulins some are found among the alpha and beta fractions of globulin. These latter antibodies seem to unite with the cells only in the presence of complement. There are indications, however, t h a t the supposed non-gamma globulin antibodies are, in fact, composed of gamma globulin, but t h a t the coincident complement is responsible for the alpha or beta globulins and is masking the presence of gamma globulin on the sensitised cell. There are, nevertheless, two



S O M E G R O W I N G P O I N T S 81
types of blood-group antibody, the form that requires complement for the sensitisation of the cell, and that which does not. These differences are also reflected in the in vivo effects of antibodies on the disposal of cells. Cells sensitised by an incomplete antibody such as anti-D are removed by the spleen with a half-life of some 20 minutes for small experimental samples. Cells sensitised by an antibody that binds complement are removed much more rapidly (half-life about 5 minutes) in the liver. Agglutinating antibodies are also removed by the liver, and hsemolytic antibodies, such as immune anti-A, can bring about intravascular haemolysis. A physical difference has also been found in comparing naturally-occurring and immune antibodies, the former having a sedimentation constant in the 19S component of gamma globulin when studied in the ultra-centrifuge, whereas the latter are found in the 7S component. A rather unexpected discovery, which is being put to use particularly in chemical studies on blood groups, is that specific agglutinins can be recovered from crushed seeds of certain botanical genera, notably varieties of the Lima bean. Though the term agglutinin is used for these substances they can be thought of, not so much as antibodies but as chemical substances that agglutinate the red cells of certain blood groups. Plant agglutinins with the specificity of anti-A or anti-Ax have been found, as well as some agglutinating human cells of Groups A, B and AB but not O. Also agglutinins with a specificity of anti-H and anti-N have been discovered. Genetical studies on human blood have recently extended beyond the confines of the red-blood cells. The antigenic structure of leucocytes also promises to reveal a complexity not far different from that of the erythrocyte. Moreover certain serum globulins have also been shown



82 H U M A N B L O O D G R O U P S
to be inherited characters. The haptoglobulins, alpha-2
globulins capable of binding free haemoglobin, furnish one
example and there are certain beta globulins which are
also inherited, and the so-called Gm serum groups. These,
as well as other interesting and related topics such as the
varieties of haemoglobin and of the sickling gene, are out
side the scope of this book.
