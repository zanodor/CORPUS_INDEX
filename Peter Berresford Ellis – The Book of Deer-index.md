heritage , the Celtic scribes and artists " ·ere not simpl:-· content to produce mere

THE BOOK OF DEER
' One o f the principal antiquities of cotland ' was hovv the Third Statistical Account ef Scotland
de cribed the ninth-century illustrated Gospel manu cript known as The Book ef Deer which is
now presen-ed in the Library of Cambridge Uni,·er ity. Whi le the manuscript book is not o
ophi t icated a o me of its better known brethre n, uch as t ho e from Ke lls, Durrow and
Lindi farn , neverthe less it has a fa cinating vi ual vibrancy howing trong pagan Celtic motifs.
MoreO\·e r, it i o f intrin ic importance for a we ll as it main Latin text the work carries a gloss
from the ninth century and additions made in the e leventh and twe lfth centurie in what is
regarded a the earlie t known written cotti h Gaelic a oppo ed to its parental O ld Irish .
The Book ef Deer o riginated in the Celtic mo na te ry of Deer in Aberdeen . The book
actually carries the tory of the foundation of the monastery in an e leventh-century Gaelic text.
Colmci lle, ometimes known a t Columba , AD 52 1-597, made a journey to ee Bruide Mac
Mae lchon (c. AD 556-584), king of the Tuatha C ruithne, more popularly known today by their
Latin nickname, Picts (picti, painted people). The purpo e of t hi vi it wa to C hristianize them
and, after a conflict with the Druids of Bruide, o lmcill e set in m otion the process. According
to the tory, in about AD 580 Colmci lle, together with one o f hi di ciples, t Dro tan Mac
Cosg rach, came to a place named Aberdour. Thi i not to be confused with Aberdour in Fife
but was a pot on the o uthe rn tributary o f the Rive r Ug ie, ju t to the west o f modern
Peterhead in Aberdeen hire. The mi sionaries decided to e tablish a re ligious e ttlement at the
pot w hich wa later called Deer.
Mo t significantly, th name Deer i an Ang licization of the Gaelic doire, the place of
oak , o a sociated with Druidic wo r hip. Many churche in the Celtic world , uch as Derry,
Durrow, Ki ldare and o the r s, we re fo und ed o n sites whi c h we re o rig ina lly Druidic oak
anc tuari e . Thi area wa , in fact, o n e o f the la t areas o f t he Ce lt ic world t o becom e
Chri tianized.
The o rig inal mo nastery of Deer, where the book wa compi led in the ninth century,
11

must. not be confused w ith the later Cistercian monastery of
Deer which was founded in to AD 12 19 and whose ruins still
stand som e two miles west of the o ri g inal site . Thi
monastery fell into disuse after 1587 when William Ke ith ,
Earl Marischal of Scotland, who had been ' Abbot and
Commendator of D eer', r esig ne d hi s office after
criticism from the Kirk for his lukewarm eccl esiastical
modifications during the Reformation in Scotland.
W hile Colmcille returned to Iona, Drostan stayed
as abbot of the foundation and the rights of the
settlement were confirmed by Bruide, the local
mormae r (mor-mhaor, a high ste ward answerabl e
only to the king).
Th e Boo k of Dee r co n sis t s of 86 fo Iios
containing the first six chapters of the Gospel of t
Matthew and the first 22 verses of the seventh
chapter, the fir st fo ur chapters o f St Mark and the
first 35 verses of t he fifth chapte r, the first three
chapter s of St Luke and the first verse of the
fourth chapter and the entire Gospel of St John.
There is also the Aposties' C r eed . These arc
,,,ritten in a rather bad Latin , with careless spelling and
grammatical errors. T he Latin is close to the Yulgate form
and similar to the te xt called the ' Irish Gospel' whi ch had lo ng since bee n abandoned by
Rome. This text was writte n by a unifo rm hand w hich has led pre,·ious authorities to claim
that the entire ninth-century content of the book, including the illustrations, was by a single
monk of the monast e r y. H oweve r, artist Roy Ell sworth , when pre paring t hi s study,
de monstrated that at least two separate styles ex ist in the artwork and possibly a third , o that
while one m onk wrote the text , at least two were responsible for the illustrations.
The re is a strong arg ume nt that The Book of Deer is, in fact , the o ld est suniving
12
TH E BOOK OF DEER I IBRAR Y OF CE LTI C I LLUMINATED MA , U C RIPT
manuscript work of native Pictish scribes rather than Irish scribes fro m
th e Dai R.iada e ttl e m c nt on th e Argy ll coast. The motifs can be
compared with those o n the remarkable Pictish symbol stones of the
area dating from between the seventh and ninth centuries. This might
also account for the crude knowledge of Latin di played by the writer
and the lack of sophisticati on of the artwork which is unusual in the
tradition of the Irish Gospel books.
The textua l scribe of the ninth century has added the usua l
co lophon asking for prayer s for the work and its c reator to his Latin
text (see page. 60). This g ives the book value, for the scribe writes in
Gae lic and not in the usual Latin form found in Irish books : 'Forchubus
caichduini imbia ar rath inlenbran co ll[ aratardda bendacht jo ranmain
intruaaain rodscribai... ' A colloquial translation of this wou ld be : ' Let it
be o n the conscience of everyone who uses this splendid little book, that
they say a bles ing for the soul of the wretch who wrote it.'
In the eleventh century another scribe added the Office for the
Visitation of th e Sick in Latin but thi s ve r sion still s hows Celt ic
Christian usages and resembles the Eastern Orthodox rather than the
Ro man fo rm o f liturgy. In spite of the e ffo r ts t o bring t he Celt ic
Church in cotland under the influence o f Canterbury and ultimately
Rome by St Margaret , the Anglo -Saxon wife of Malco lm Canmore
during this sam e pe ri od, we still fi nd reports of the Cele D e (Culdees
o r 'se r vants of God' ), the Celtic monastic o rde r founded by St
Mae lru ain in AD 787, working in Scotland down to t he fourteenth
century.
Also in the eleventh century was added the stor y of the
fo undation of Deer in Gae lic which begins: 'Columcille acus Drostan mac
Coosa rea ado/ta tanaator ahf mar roa lse9 Dfa aonfc Abborddoboir
... '(C?lmcille and Drostan son of Cosgrach , his pupil, cam e from Hy

from David I ( 1124- 1 153) .
The g rant is histori cally o f
impo rtan ce because David I,
raised from childhood at the
Eng lish co urt and o rman
Fre nch in culture, fought for
fi ,·e years to bring the Scots of
thi s a r e a und e r hi s rul e . David
married the Anglo- o rman Matilda
and was libe ral in giving estates to Anglo - o rman lords once
he cam e t o the Scottish throne . The cots of the province o f
Moire abh ( M o r ay - an a r ea mu c h la rger than t he mod e rn
county) fought against David because they rejected his po licies
and t he introduction of o rman feudalism , and t hey tri ed t o
maintain the o ld Celtic egalitarian syste m. The g rant to Deer
was g iYe n in the e ig hth year of hi s r e ign but the d ays of the Ce lti c
mo nastery were numbered and, as prcviou ly m entio ned , a C iste rc ian m onaster y
of D eer replaced the Celtic abbey in 12 19 .
Hi stori cally, the g r ants of land to D eer ar c fa sci nating. It is th e first source fo r
showing the decent ralized structure o f Ce ltic cotland and the first wo rk to ment ion the ro le
of the o ffi ce of m o rmaer. We have r e fe r e nce t o Mao l-Callum , who, with his bro the r
G ill ecomgain , slew their unc le Fin laech Mac Ruar idh in 1020. Finlaech was m o rmaer of
Moireabh and was married to Doada, daug hte r o f t he Scotti sh High King, Mao l-Callum
(Malcolm II , 1005 - 1034). They had a fiftee n-year -o ld son at the time o f his murde r - the
boy' nam e was Mac Beth .
The Annals ef Ulster record that in 1032 Gillccomgain , vvho had he lped kill MacBeth 's
14
T H E BO O K OF D EE R LIBRARY 0 1· CE I T I C II L UMI N AT E D MANU C R I PT
father, was himself killed, pe rhaps on the o rders of Malcolm II . Gillecomgain was marri ed to
a lady call ed Gruoch, the daughte r of the fo rme r High King Coinneach (Kenne th III, 997
1005). They had a son called Lulach.
MacBeth now married Gruoch and ado pted he r son Lulach and went o n to becom e
High King of Scotland fro m 1040 to 1057, o ne of t he g reatest kjngs Scotland was to haYe.. . in
spite o f subseque nt pro paganda and hakcspeare's creatio n. From 1057 to 1058 Lulach
succeeded MacBeth as High King before he was 'slain by stratagem ' by Malcolm Canmore . It
is fro m The Book ef Deer that we learn that Lulach's son Maelsnechta becam e m ormaer o f
Mo ireabh and granted lands to the m onastery of Deer befor e his expulsion from office in
1078. The Annals ef Ulster record that Mae lsnechta became a monk and died in 1085. It is
m or e than likely that Maelsncchta becam e a m onk of Deer. It would be a fantasy, though not
an unreasonable one, t o romanticize that Maesnechta himself might have w ritten som e of the
e leventh century no tation to The Book ef Deer. We find that Angus, the son of Mae lsnechta's
unnamed siste r, was mormacr of Moircabh at the time o f his death in 1130.
The Book ef Deer is, w ithout doubt, an historical treasure. But what happened to it
after the de truction of the Celtic m onastery of Deer and the rise o f t he Cister cian abbey? We
know that it ' disappeared ', probably taken as booty in the attempted conquests
of Scotland by the English, fo r in 1697 it em erged as part of the library
o f ! o hn Moo r e, Bisho p o f o rwi c h . This librar y was bo ught fo r
6,000 guineas by King George I ( 17 14 - 1727) o n the advice of his
secretary o f tate, Charles, Viscount Townshend ( 1674-1738), who
later adYi sed Geo rge t o take har sh
m easures to repress the
1715 upri sing in Scotland .
George I ga,·c the library as a
gift to the library o f Cambridge
Uni versity.
Fo r 150 years, Th e Book ef Deer

Henry Bradshaw, stumbled across it in 1860 and

Whitley St okes, who made a translatio n o f
the Gaeli c ent ries which appeared in the Saturda)'
Review, 8 December 1860. He e xpanded on this in a
b o o k e ntitl e d Goidili ca, or ot es on th e Gael ic

in 1866. Three years later John Stuar t edited a text
and facs imil es of the illustratio ns w hi c h we r e
published for the Spalding Club of Edinburgh, in 1869.
After that , however, The Book of Deer was forgotte n again , only to
be m entioned now and then in academic disco urses en passant until Professo r
Kenneth Jackson of Edinburgh made the Gaelic notations the subject of hi s O sborn
Bergin Memorial Lecture in March 1970 . Jackson expanded his lect ure and published it as The
Gaelic otes in the Book ofDeer, Cambridge University Press , 1972.
The inte ntio n of this vo lume is firstly to present accurate r epresentations of t he
illust rations from The Book of Deer and then to provide simplified drawings to demonstr ate
construct ion methods and to allow an exploration of one 's own colo ur arrangements using, a
a guide, the full colour plates.

rectangles are true and there i care in the drawing, the)· do not quite come up to the same standard as that of
Fol. 46. Celtic kc)" and kn ot\\·ork patterns and motifs demonstrate a St)·le similar to man)· of the early Irish
Gospel book such as The Book ef Dimma. The fig ure of t Mark (Fol. 166) i similar in style to the hange list
as depicted in The Book ef Durron-. Mark carries a'! object which may represent a book in ornamental binding;
this is a commo n enough mo tif in de pictio ns of Mark in early Celtic manuscript art. Howe,·e r, judging from
the hape, the o bject. in front of the saints haYe been claimed as reliquary caske ts, which we will discuss in
our no te o n Fol. lb.
The figure of t Luke (Fol. 296) can al ·o be compared to his ,·isualizatio n in The Book ef Durroll',
tho ugh the same mo tifs can also be found in the fig ure of Luke in the ' Mac Durnan Gospels' . The figures of
the t\\·o E,·angclists and two angels on Fol. 86 arc analogou to som e o f the pages o f The Book ef Lindiifarne
with their quaint nourishes and fe rn leaf clusters.

The hand of another illustrator executed the

curious \'ariety of thickness of lines, there
appear a greater regularity of shape but a
crud enes to the faces. Fol. lb has signs of thi

perhaps to hide his lack of abilit)· to draw them. Of the feet of Mark , Luke and Jo hn , "'e can say that they

One \\'Onclers \\'he the r this \\'as an intentio nal 'o ve rsight'. Did the artist originally dra\\' the figures

s9 uatting fig ure appea rs in a long tradition of pagan Celtic art. Gods, suc h as Ccrnunn os, seen in lri h
tradition as The Dagda, ' Father of the Gods', are o ften depicted in a Buddha-l ike posture . Most famous is a
,·isualizatio n o n the G unde trup Cau ldron (sec Fig. A) . Perhaps th e illustrator was follo\\'ing the paga n

The transfor matio n of Latin le tters into a distin ctly Gae lic script i · aid to ha,·e occurred in the e,·enth

Tuaim Drecain (Tomregan , Co Ca,·an) , o ne o f the g reat unh·e r ities in 'Dark Age' Ire land. While established
by the re lig ious, the uni,·ersit)· was essential!)· for lay . tudents and there were four faculties : a law school, a
school for classics, a medical school and a school of general Irish learning. Each faculty was run b)· a non
chu1·chman , a druimc/i o r professor.
Cenn Faelad (d. AD 670 ) wa not a monk but a la)·man who was educated in Latin and then followed
an Irish course of studies. He becam e o ne of the best knO\rn o f the cholars of Tuaim Drecain. While only
fragments of his writings re main , he is kn own to ha,·e written a treatise on Irish g rammar, a work on
traditional legal maxims and omc hi torical texts. He was known to ha,·e uppo rted Colmcille's missionary
wo rk in what becam e Scotland. The re is r e ference to a work written by Ccnn Fae lad in support o f
Colmcille's contention at th e S)·nod of Druim Ccatt in AD 575 that the Argyll Dai Riadan settle ments hould
be independent of Irish interference. It is claimed that Cenn Faclad ,·isited, amo ng o ther establishments, the
Abbn of Deer. In this ,·i ·it to Pictland he adrncatcd the use of Latin letter s to make written reco rds of
learning. According to the Irish scholar Alice to pford Green ( 1847- 1929), in her History efihe Irish State to
I O1-l ( 1925 ), 'Cenn Faclad established the unio n o f the Latin and Gaelic schools in a common culture'.

On man;· folios of The Book?[ Deer there occur doodles of dogs' heads, birds, hares, dee r and, o n Fol. 7 1b, a
human fig ure which seem · extreme l;· pagan in representatio n but prcsumabl;· i~ meant a. a bearded saint. The
figu re holds up both hands in the sam e manner as pagan Celtic god ha,·e been depicted, particular!;· the
fig ures on the Gu ndestrup Cauldron. The figure (Fig. B) from the Cauldron, tho ught to be a re pre entation of
Taranis, god or thunder, shows the hand in this typical Celtic position but he holds dead animals. Indeed , also
gi,·en here as illustratio n (Fig. C) is a crude rock can ·ing of Cernunnos, with stag's antlers, fro m the fo urth
century BC found at Val Camonica in what was then C isalpine Gaul (northern ltal;"). T his clearly demo nstrates
the continuity of depiction of ho l;· personages.
The two top figures of the fou r hangelists o n Fol. 85b hold their hands up in similar benediction o r
supplicatio n while the third simply ho ld his hands o ut in the form of a crucifix , echoing the positio n of t
Luke on Fol. 29b. The fou rth hangelist has no hands at al l. Why did the artist change his m ind half-way
through thi page? Did he realize the unintentio nal pagan symbo lism o f the first two figures and then alter the
position consciously for the third and fourth hangelists? The fo ur hange list as they appear on Fol.lb do not
suffer this curiosit)·, being shown witho ut ha nds at all but with the bottom two apparently ho lding books or
reliquary caskets. For comparath·e purposes we show (Figs. D and E) two ea kets from this pe ri od - e ighth
and ninth centuries - both from Lough Erne, near Tully, Co. Fermanagh . These ea kets,made of yew wood,
gilt, tin and highlighted by amber and glas ·, would ha,·e been familiar o bjects to the artists.

Many of the zoomorphic dood les arc crudely drawn but arc comparable with the animals which occur o n
several of the Pictish stones of the a1-ea as well as in other manuscript books. Howe,·e r, the symbo lism of such
an imals tretchcs back far beyond Christian time . A detail of incised decoration o n a Celt ic long-necked
ceramic flagon from the fo urth centu ry BC, fo und at Matzhausen , Germany, sho ws a similar hare (Fig. F).
That animals played an important ro le in pagan Celtic li fe i ecn by their prolifk appearance in the ar t of the
period and this role continued under Christianity. The Gundestrup Cauldron is full of such fabu lous pagan
mytho logical imagery. The figure of a Celtic hunte r god, with knife, hound and hare (Fig. G), sho ws the
impo rtance of these animals and is dated to th e fi rst century AD; it wa found at To uget, Gcr , in France. The
exciting surreali m of some Celtic form gives food for thought . What seem to be a hare in The Book ef Deer
might easily be the surreal form o f a horse, which was equal ly re,·ered. For a comparison, Fig. H shows the
White Ho rse at Uffington, tho ught to ha,·e been executed by Belgae craftsm en between the fir t century BC
and the first century AD. It is 365 feet from nose to tail. T he same style of ho rse is depicted o n a gold coin of
the Celtic Aulerci tribe of Britain dating from the first century BC .

A series of visual analyses of famous Celtic illuminated Gospel books. Roy Ellsworth, Australian-born artist, demonstrates Celtic art techniques. Ellsworth has long been attracted by the rich traditions of early Celtic art and fascinated by Celtic mythology. He has an international reputation in the field of illustration. An introducti~n and notes to each work are supplied by Peter Berresford Ellis, a leading authority on Celtic culture and history.
No I : THE BOOK OF DEER
'One of the principle antiquities of Celtic Scotland' was how this ninthcentury Gospel book was described in the nineteenth century. Written and illustrated by at least two monks of Deer, near Aberdeen, its art is not as sophisticated as some of its better known brethren like Kells, Durrow or Lindisfarne. evertheless, it has a fascinating visual vibrancy showing strong pagan Celtic motifs. One is reminded that this was the last Celtic area to become Christianized in the sixth and seventh centuries. It is no coincidence that Deer takes its name from doire, the
place of oaks associated with Druidic worship. ow in Cambridge
University Library, The Book efDeer is priceless, not only for being the oldest indisputably Scottish Gospel manuscript, but for its marginal notes written in Gaelic, showing the transition into the Scottish form as opposed to Old Irish, made in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
As well as Roy Ellsworth's interpretive artwork, three full-colour photographic illustrations of the original work are reproduced.
