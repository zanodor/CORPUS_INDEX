# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Based on historical records, Ahar Banas culture of Archaeological reports is Ahir Bāṇās(ura) Copper Hoard Culture.pdf

1
Based on historical records, Ahar-Banas culture of Archaeological reports is Ahir-Bāṇās(ura) Copper Hoard Culture
I suggest that there is a conflation of expressions: Ahar-Banas Culture of Ahar and Banas rivers and Ahir-Bāṇās(ura) Culture of शोण river, a tributary of Ganga.
I submit that an identification of Ahir-Bāṇās(ura) Culture will remove the disjointed presentations created by names such as Ochre-Coloured Pottery (OCP), Black-and-Red Ware Culture, Copper Hoard Culture. The key geophysical reality is the diversion of Yamuna eastwards (away from being a tributary of River Sarasvati) caused by plate tectonics and the resultant Yamuna tear on Siwalik ranges.

Thosar's is a lucid presentation of the history of the Abhira people.
Bāṇās(ura)'s kingdom had the capital at Śoṇitapura (शोणणतपुर) on the banks of शोण river which is the 2nd largest Ganga tributary and the artifacts found at Sanauli (chariots, swords and anthropomorphs on coffins) are likely to be the products which link with Abhira artificers of Ahir-Bāṇās(ura) Culture which has made significant contributions to the wealth of the nation.
Bāṇa is said to have ruled in Tripuri (Mod. Tewar) on the Narmadā river in Madhya Pradeśa.

Abhira artificers are also likely to be in the lineage of ancient people who created the Copper Hoard Culture."Copper Hoard Culture describes find-complexes which occur in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. These occur mostly in hoards large and small and are believed to date to the later 2nd millennium BCE, although very few derive from controlled and dateable excavation contexts. A fragment of an anthropomorph came to light in controlled excavations at Lothal and a second one at Saipai Lichchwai, Etawah district. The doab hoards are associated with the so-called Ochre Coloured Pottery (OCP) which appears to be closely associated with the Late Harappan (or Posturban) phase."

Ahar culture is a Chalcolithic archaeological culture on the banks of Ahar River of southeastern Rajasthan state. Banas culture is situated along Banas and Berach Rivers. AharBanas people who are Abhira, used the copper ores of the Aravalli Range to make axes and other artefacts.
Ahar River is a tributary of the Berach River (itself a tributary of Banas River, which in turn is a tributary of Chambal river, itself a tributary of Yamuna River, which in turn is the most important tributary of Ganges River). One claim is that people of Ahar culture are Bhills/Bheels of this area. "Ayad was the capital of Mewar long before Maharana Udai Singh declared Udaipur the capital of Mewar. Yes, this is the truth, Ayad before Rana Udai Singh, was known by the names of ATPUR and AGHATAPURA and in the 10th century A.D. Ahar (Ayad) became the capital of the Guhila kings, the ancestors of the Ranas of Mewar before they migrated to Chittor. Ahar also gave the name of Aharia to one of the gotras of guhilot race. This place was also known by the name of Gangodbheda Tirtha which is characterized by the myth that the water of ganges percolates at this

variations among humans occur both within and among populations and range from single nucleotide changes to multiple-nucleotide variants. These multiple-nucleotide variants are useful for studying the relationships among individuals or various population groups. The study of human genetic variations can help scientists understand how different population groups are biologically related to one another. Sequence analysis of hypervariable regions of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been successfully used for the genetic characterization of different population groups for forensic purposes. It is well established that different ethnic or population groups differ significantly in their mtDNA distributions. In the last decade, very little research has been conducted on mtDNA variations in the Indian population, although such data would be useful for elucidating the history of human population expansion across the world. Moreover, forensic studies on mtDNA variations in the Indian subcontinent are also scarce, particularly in the northern part of India. In this report, variations in the hypervariable regions of mtDNA were analyzed in the Yadav population of Haryana. Different molecular diversity indices were computed. Further, the obtained haplotypes were classified into different haplogroups and the phylogenetic relationship between different haplogroups was inferred.

"A people called the Ahars had built it in Balathal near modern Udaipur some 4,500 years ago. Carbon dating established that they had lived in and around the Mewar region in Rajasthan between 3,500 and 1,800 B.C. They were Mewar's first farmers, older even than the Harappans...There are 90 sites of Ahar - a ruralsociety...Harappa's progress in the mature Harappan period (2,500 B.C.E) helped the rural Ahar people to flourish and develop their own township and stone and brick houses...Ahar culture flourished predominantly in the Mewar region of Rajasthan, on the eastern side of the Aravallis, and in undulating rocky plateaus and plains along the Banas river and its tributaries...Banas is a river which lies entirely within the state of Rajasthan in western India. It is a tributary of the Chambal River, itself a tributary of the Yamuna, which in turn merges into the Ganga. The Banas is approximately 512 kilometres in length. It drains the east slope of the central portion of the Aravalli Range, and the basin includes all or part of Ajmer, Bhilwara, Bundi,
Chittorgarh, Dausa, Jaipur, Pali, Rajsamand, Sawai Madhopur, Sirohi, Tonk, and Udaipur districts. The cities of Nathdwara, Jahazpur, and Tonk lie on the river. Major tributaries include the right bank tributaries of Berach and Menali and the left bank tributaries of Kothari, Khari, Dai, Dheel River, Sohadara River, Morel and Kalisil.The name "Banaas" literally translates as "forest-hope" (Ban-aas) meaning "Hope-of-the-forest" or 'Van Ki Aasha.' The river originates in the Veron ka Math situated in Khamnor Hills of the Aravalli Range, about 5 km from Kumbhalgarh in Rajsamand district. It flows northeast through the Mewar region of Rajasthan, then across Hadavati before meeting the Chambal near the village of Rameshwar in Sawai Madhopur District
...Ahar sites have been reported in Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Dungarpur, Bhilwara, Rajsamand, Bundi, Tonk and Ajmer dotting10,000 sq km...The Deccan College, Pune and Institute of Rajasthan Studies, Rajasthan Vidyapeeth, Udaipur turned their attention to Ahar culture in 1994 and began excavations in Balathal. Deccan College and the University of Pennsylvania began digging in Gilund in 1999and the Jaipur circle of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) began excavation at Ojiyana in Bhilwara in 2000. And discoveries began pouring in ...
The excavations reveal a large number of bull figurines indicating the Ahar people worshipped the bull. At Marmi, a site near Chittorgarh, these figures have been found in abundance indicating it could be a regional shrine of the bull cult of this rural population.

Discovery of cow-like figurines in Ojiyana, the first site found on the slope of a hill, has
baffled archaeologists... The technique of decoration in pottery known as "reserved slip" which was seen only in a few shards at the Harappan sites of Mohenjodaro and Surkotada in 2,400B.C. is a very common feature at Balathal...Speculation about intense fire-modelling activity has been supported by the discovery of kilns at Ahar sites. ..In Balathal, the black-and-red ware constitute only 8 per cent of the ceramic assemblage whereas in Ahar it is 70 per cent...An unusual discovery last year was a set of six clay pots arranged inside a large clay jar in Balathal. Of the six pots three are large black-and-red bowls decorated with geometric designs in white. One of the other vessels contained steatite beads and flowers both of which were used for stringing into necklaces...Aharites made copper tools such as chisels, razors and barbed and tanged arrow heads, apparently for hunting. Probably, they had the advantage of access to copper from the Khetri mines and in the nearby Aravalli hills. There is evidence of copper melting too. Harappans probably imported copper ores and even finished copper goods from Ahar people... In Balathal, the 2,500 B.C. fortification phase reveals a succession of stone structures inside the fortification and below the wall that ran around the residential complex.There are high-built stone platforms on the eastern edge. This implies that people knew of stone architecture when the settlement began around 3,500 B.C. though fortification began later. Wooden beams and rafters made the roof, capped by mud in case of stone walls and by thatch in case of smaller structures of wooden posts and mud walls...Locally available granite and gneiss rock were used in construction and the average size of stone blocks was 25 cm long, 20 cm wide and 15 cm thick... At Balathal, there are remains of a wall that probably surrounded the residential complex and a fortified structure in the centre of the habitation.Like Harappan citadels, it is built over mud-brick platforms, and fortification walls are broadened towards the base. Gilund had long and wide parallel walls. Shinde who began excavations at the site with a University of Pennsylvania team says, "Gilund is emerging as an urban centre of the Aharites." One complex is of 8,000 sq ft, and there are more like it around...Aharites abandoned the sites in 1,800 B.C.E...Balathal, for example, remained unoccupied until 300 B.C., when in the Mauryan era, some people re-occupied the sites. Lalti Pandey of the Institute of Rajasthan Studies says of these people that "they knew of iron smelting and manufactured iron implements''. Two iron smelting furnaces have been found in Balathal in this phase...In Mewar, there is a long and continuous history of human habitation. It seems that influenced by Ahar culture, hunter-gatherer-herders of the region took to farming and became the forerunners of today's rural society in southern Rajasthan.Mishra says others took to stock breeding and became Gadris (shepherds)and Rabaris (camel breeders). Then there are communities like the Gemetis, Meghwals and Bawarias who continue to practise their traditional occupation of hunters to this day. Some of them used to eat carrion until a few decades ago.The odhnis of Gameti women bear a tell-tale resemblance to the trademark redand-black pottery of Ahar culture. And evidence of the folk religion of the Ahars survives among the Kalbelias, the community to which the dancer Gulabo, famed in Rajasthani folklore, belonged. The Ahars aren't dead. They still live among us.

Over 100 seal impressions dating to 2100-1700 B.C.E. The hieroglyph sun's ray is read in Meluhha: arka 'sun's rays' rebus: arkasal 'copper-, gold-smith workshop'.
In 2003 excavations at Gilund, archaeologists discovered a large cache of seal impressions dating to 2100–1700 BC. A large bin filled with more than 100 seal impressions was found by a team led by archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the Deccan College (Pune)..there are parallels with seals from the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan, 1,000 miles to the northwest..Typical Ahar pottery is a Black-and-Red ware (BRW) with linear and dotted designs painted on it in white pigment[3] and has a limited range of shapes, which include bowls, bowls-on-stands, elongated vases and globular vases. The Ahar culture also had equally distinctive brightly slipped Red Ware, a Tan ware, ceramics in Burnished Black that were incised Thin Red ware, as well as incised and otherwise decorated Gray ware fabrics.
