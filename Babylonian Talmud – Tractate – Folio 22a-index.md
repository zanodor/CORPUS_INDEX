Babylonian Talmud: Tractate ‘Abodah Zarah
///
Folio 22a
— R. Simeon b. Eleazar has not in mind the metayage principle at all;
but the reason why he permits in the case of an idolater is because,
if he is told [to abstain from work on forbidden days] he obeys. But a
Cuthean, too, if told would surely obey! — A Cuthean would not
obey; he would say: 'I am more learned than thou!' If that is so, why
then mention the objection of the field being called by the owner's
name; he could have given the reason of not placing a stumbling
block before the blind?1 — He mentions that reason as an additional
one, as if to say: There is the one reason of [not placing a stumbling
block] before the blind, and there is also the objection of its being
called by his name.
Two2 saffron-growers, [one of whom was] a heathen who took
charge of the field on the Sabbath, and [the other] an Israelite who
did so on the Sunday, came before Raba; he declared the
partnership as permissible. Rabina, however, cited the following in
refutation of Raba's ruling: If an Israelite and a heathen leased a field
in partnership, the Israelite must not say subsequently to the
heathen, Take as thy share the profit in respect of the Sabbath, and I
will take as mine that in respect of a week-day;3 only when such a
condition was made originally is it permitted. [Likewise] if they just
calculate the profit4 it is forbidden! Whereupon he [Raba] blushed.
Subsequently, the fact came to light that the partners had indeed
laid down that condition originally.



R. Gabiha of Be-Kathil5 said: That was a case of 'orlah6 plants, the
produce of which the heathen was to eat during the forbidden years
and the Israelite during [a corresponding number of] permitted
years, and they came before Raba who permitted it.7 But did not
Rabina cite a statement in objection to Raba's ruling? — [No,] it was
in order to support it.8 Then why did Raba blush? — That never
occurred at all.
The question was asked: What if no arrangements at all were made?
— Come and hear [the above passage]: 'Only when such a condition
was made originally is it permitted,' hence, if there was no
arrangement it is forbidden. Continue, then, with the next part: 'If
they calculated the profit it is forbidden,' which implies that, if there
was no arrangement it is permitted! — The fact is, no answer can be
deduced from this passage.
CHAPTER II
MISHNAH. ONE SHOULD NOT PLACE CATTLE IN HEATHENS'
INNS,9 BECAUSE THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF IMMORAL PRACTICE
WITH THEM. A WOMAN SHOULD NOT BE ALONE WITH THEM,
BECAUSE THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF LEWDNESS, NOR SHOULD A
MAN BE ALONE WITH THEM, BECAUSE THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF
SHEDDING BLOOD.

1. Lev. XIX, 14. V. supra. 6a.
2. Lit., 'these'.
3. As the partnership was entered into unconditionally, the duty of
working the field devolved equally on both partners. The work
carried out by the heathen on the Sabbath is therefore done by
him, in respect of one half thereof, as the agent of the Israelite.



4. If the Israelite apportions the profits in respect of the Sabbath
to the heathen even without telling him explicitly to work on the
Sabbath it is likewise forbidden, as in the absence of specific
conditions, the assumption is that the heathen is to work on
behalf of the Jew on the Sabbath — which is in direct
opposition to Raba's ruling.
5. [On the Tigris, north of Bagdad (Obermeyer, op. cit. p. 147).]
6. Lit., uncircumcised', newly-planted trees, the produce of which
is forbidden during the first three years. V. Lev. XIX, 23.
7. This is quite in order since even during the forbidden years, the
Israelite is only forbidden to eat of the produce, but is permitted
to do the work. There is therefore no objection to the heathen's
working even though he does so as the Israelite's agent.
8. The statement in Rabina's citation, that where the prohibition
does not extend to the work — as in the case of laying down the
conditions originally — the arrangement is permitted, distinctly
supports Raba's ruling in regard to produce of 'orlah trees.
9. (On the ill-repute of the Greek and Roman inns, v. Elmslie a.l.]

‘Abodah Zarah 22b
GEMARA. The following was cited in contradiction: One may buy of
them cattle for a sacrifice, and it need not be feared lest it
committed, or had been used for, an immoral act, or had been
designated as an offering to idols, or had been worshipped.1 Now
we are quite right not to fear about its having been designated as an
offering to idols or having been made an object of worship, since if it
had been so designated or worshipped, its owner would not have
sold it; but we surely ought to fear as to committing an immoral act!2
— Said R. Tahlifa in the name of R. Shila b. Abina in the name of Rab:



A heathen would have regard for his cattle, lest it becomes barren.3
This would indeed hold good in the case of female cattle but what
answer would you give in the case of males? — Said R. Kahana:
Because it has a deteriorating effect on their flesh. Then what about
that [Baraitha] which has been taught: 'One may buy cattle of any
heathen shepherd'; ought we not to fear lest he used it for an
immoral purpose?4 — The heathen shepherd would be afraid of
forfeiting his fee. What then about this [other Baraitha] which has
been taught: 'One should not entrust cattle to a heathen shepherd';5
why not assume that the heathen shepherd would be afraid of
forfeiting his fee? — They fear detection by one another since they
know a good deal about it, but they are not afraid of us who do not
know much about it. Rabbah said: This is what the popular proverb
says. 'As the stylus penetrates the stone so one cunning mind
detects another.' In that case, neither should we buy male cattle6
from women, for fear of their having used them for immoral practice!
— She would be afraid of being followed about by the animal. What
then about this which R. Joseph learnt: 'A widow should not rear
dogs, nor accommodate a student as a guest'? Now it is quite right
in the case of a student, as she might reckon on his modesty,7 but in
the case of a dog why not say that she would be afraid of being
followed about by it? — Since it would follow about on being thrown
a piece of meat, people will say that it is because of being given such
pieces that it follows her. Why then should we not leave female
animals alone with female heathens?8 — Said Mar 'Ukba b. Hama:
Because heathens frequent their neighbours' wives, and should one
by chance not find her in, and find the cattle there, he might use it
immorally. You may also say that even if he should find her in he
might use the animal, as a Master has said:9 Heathens prefer the
cattle of Israelites to their own wives, for R. Johanan said: When the
serpent came unto Eve he infused filthy lust into her.10 If that be so
[the same should apply] also to Israel! — When Israel stood at Sinai



that lust was eliminated, but the lust of idolaters, who did not stand
at Sinai, did not cease.
The question was asked: How about fowls?11 — Come and hear: Rab
Judah said in the name of Samuel on behalf of R. Hanina: I saw a
heathen buy a goose in the market, use it immorally, and then
strangle it, roast, and eat it. Also R. Jeremiah of Difti12 said: I saw an
Arab who bought a side [of meat], pierced it for the purpose of an
immoral act, after which act he roasted and ate it.

sacrifice (Tosef. 'A.Z. II). V. B.K. 40b.

conflict with our Mishnah.

suspect it.

Folio 23a
Rabina said:1 There is really no contradiction; the one teaching
[prohibits it] in the first instance; the other [permits it] after it
happened.2 And whence do we know that a difference is to be made
in a case between the first instance and where it had happened?
From the following: We have learnt: A WOMAN SHOULD NOT BE
ALONE WITH THEM, BECAUSE THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF
LEWDNESS; now this seems to be contradicted by the following: A
woman who had been imprisoned by heathens in connection with
money matters, is permissible to her husband,3 but if on a capital
charge, she is forbidden to her husband.4 Does this not go to prove
that we make a difference in a case between the first instance and
where it had happened?5 — Not at all! It may indeed be that the
prohibition applies even after it happened, but here the reason is that
the heathen will be afraid to forfeit his money! You can indeed prove
it by what is stated in the second clause: 'If on a capital charge, she
is forbidden to her husband.' So there is no more [to be said about
this].
R. Pedath said: There is no contradiction;6 the one is [according to]
R. Eliezer, the other is [according to] the Rabbis. For we have learnt
in connection with the Red Heifer:7 R. Eliezer says: It must not be
bought of a heathen, but the Sages permit it.8 Is not [the point] on
which they differ this: that R. Eliezer holds that we suspect immoral
practice whilst the Rabbis hold that we do not suspect immoral
practice?9 — Whence [do you know this]? It may well be said that all
agree that immoral practice is not to be suspected, the reason for R.
Eliezer's opinion being this: he holds the view presented by Rab
Judah in the name of Rab. For Rab Judah said in the name of Rab: [In



the case of the Red Heifer]10 even if a bundle of sacks has been laid
on her she becomes ritually unfit, but in the case of the calf,11 only if
she had been made to draw a burden. [It may thus be that] one
master12 is of the opinion that we should suspect,13 and the other
that we should not suspect it! — Do not let this enter your mind; for
the sake of a small benefit one would not risk a big loss.14 Let us
then say likewise that for the sake of a little enjoyment15 one would
not risk so big a loss! — In that instance his passion impels him.
But [still] it may be that all agree that immoral practice is not to be
suspected, but that the reason for R. Eliezer's ruling is the one given
in the teaching of Shila? For Shila learned: 'What is the reason for R.
Eliezer's ruling? [It is the scriptural words:] Speak unto the Children
of Israel that they bring unto thee,16 [which imply that] Israelites
shall bring, but it should not be brought by heathens'!17 — Do not let
this enter your mind; for it is stated in the second clause: 'R. Eliezer
applied this disqualification to all other kinds of sacrifices.' Now were
you to adduce the reason as taught by Shila, it would hold good in
the case of the [red] heifer, in connection with which Scripture
mentions 'bringing', but does Scripture ever mention 'bringing' in
connection with other sacrifices? But [still] might we not say, then,
that the Rabbis differ from R. Eliezer

only in the case of the [red] heifer which commands a high price,1
but that in the case of other sacrifices they agree with him? — In that
case, whose opinion would the [Baraitha] taught [above, viz.]: 'We
may purchase from heathen cattle for [ordinary] sacrifices'
represent? Neither that of R. Eliezer nor that of the Rabbis! Moreover,



it is distinctly taught as follows:2 What was cited as a refutation to R.
Eliezer by his colleagues is, All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered
together unto thee ... they shall come up with acceptance on mine
altar.3
The difference of opinions4 is only in regard to suspicion, so that
where the immoral use is certain, the heifer is unfit. From here then
you can deduce that the degree of sanctity of the red heifer is that of
animals sacrificed on the altar; for if it had only the sanctity of those
[dedicated] to repairs of the temple,5 immoral use should not render
it unfit! — The red heifer may be different [in this respect alone],
because it is designated by Divine law as a sin-offering.6 If that be
so, it ought to be unfit if it be a Yoze Dofan:7 and were you to say
that it is so indeed, why then are we taught: If one dedicates a Yoze
Dofan as a red heifer, it is unfit, but R. Simeon declares it as fit?8
Again, were you to say that R. Simeon follows here the opinion he
expressed elsewhere that a Yoze Dofan is to be regarded as a
properly born child,9 has not R. Johanan said that R. Simeon
admitted, in regard to sacred things, that it is not valid for such
sanctity?10 — But the case of the red heifer is different; since a
blemish renders it unfit, immoral use or idolatrous worship also
render it unfit;11 for Scripture says, for their corruption is in them,
there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted,12 and the
School of R. Ishmael taught:13 Wherever 'corruption' is mentioned it
only means lewdness and idolatry: 'lewdness', as it is said, for all
flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth;14 and 'idolatry', for
Scripture says, lest ye deal corruptly, to make ye a graven image,15
and since a blemish renders the red heifer unfit, immoral use and
idolatrous worship also render it unfit.
The above text stated: 'Shila learned, What is the reason for R.
Eliezer's ruling? [It is the scriptural words,] Speak unto the Children
of Israel that they bring unto thee, [which imply that] Israelites shall



bring, but it should not be brought by heathens.' According to this,
Speak unto the Children of Israel that they take for me an offering16
should also mean that Israelites should take and that it should not be
taken of idolaters! And were you to say that it does indeed mean so,
surely Rab Judah reported in the name of Samuel:17 R. Eliezer
[himself] was asked: To what extent is honouring one's father and
mother to be practised? He answered: Go forth and see how a
certain idolater of Ashkelon, Dama the son of Nathina by name,
acted towards his father. He was once approached about selling
precious stones for the ephod18

at a profit of six hundred thousand [denarii] (R. Kahana's version is
eight hundred thousand); but the keys were lying under his father's
head-pillow, so he would not disturb him!1 — The words 'onyx
stones'2 are detached from the preceding words.3 But are they not
followed by and stones to be set4 which again connects them?
Moreover, the sequel to the report is:5 In a subsequent year a 'red
heifer' was born in his herd, and some of the Sages of Israel called
on him.6 Said he to them: From what I know of you [I am aware] that
if I were to demand of you all the money in the world, you would give
it to me, but all I ask of you now is that money that I had lost because
of my father!7 — In that case it was purchased through [the agency
of] Israelite merchants.8
Does R. Eliezer then hold that immoral use is not to be suspected?9



Has it not been taught: When the incident was mentioned to R.
Eliezer of [a Red Heifer] having been bought of a heathen named
Dama — or, as some say, named Ramaz — R. Eliezer replied: What
does that prove, seeing that Israelites watched the heifer from the
hour of its birth?10 — R. Eliezer indeed admits both reasons, that of
its having to be brought [by an Israelite] as well as the suspicion of
immoral use.
The Master said: 'Israelites watched the heifer from the hour of its
birth.' But is there not the suspicion that its mother may have been
ill-used when she bore her, seeing that Raba said: The young of a
goring cow is unfit11 for it was both the cow and her young that did
the goring. Likewise the young of an ill-used animal is unfit, since the
animal and the young were ill-used together? — What is evidently
meant is that it was watched by Israelites from the time it was first
formed. Still, is there not the suspicion of the mother having been ill
used previously, for we have learnt: As to all those which are
forbidden to be offered on the altar — their young12 are
permitted.13 And thereon it was learnt that R. Eliezer forbade. Now,
this is all right according to [the exposition of] Raba, for Raba said in
the name of R. Nahman: The dispute only applies to a case of an
animal being ill-used when already dedicated as a sacrifice; but if
when still in an ordinary state, all agree that [the young] is permitted.
But how will you explain it according to R. Huna b. Hinena who said in
the name of R. Nahman that the dispute applies only to a case of an
animal being ill-used while still undedicated, but if when already
dedicated all agree that [the young] is forbidden?14 — Then we
must say that the mother, too, was watched by Israelites since the
time it was first formed. And why not raise the suspicion of the
mother's mother having been ill-used? — We should not let
suspicion go so far as all that.
The Master said: 'It was watched by Israelites from the time it was



first formed.' How did they know it?15 — Said R. Kahana: A red cup is
being passed before [the mother] when the male is mating with
her.16 If that is so, why should [a red heifer] be so costly?
Because even two hairs [of another colour] render her unfit. Then
why [use this means] on their [animals]?17 — Said R. Kahana: Only
with specified breeds [is it effective].
R. Ammi and R. Isaac Nappaha were sitting in the tent of R. Isaac
Nappaha when one of them began to cite: Thus R. Eliezer forbade
[cattle bought of a heathen] for all sacrifices. Thereupon the other
stated that, in refutation of R. Eliezer's opinion, there was cited by his
colleagues [the verse], All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered
together unto Thee ... they shall come up with acceptance on my
altar;18 to which R. Eliezer replied: All these will become self-made
proselytes in the time to come.19 Said R. Joseph: What is the
scriptural authority for this? For then will I turn to the peoples a pure
language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord.20 Abaye
asked: perhaps this merely means that they will turn away from
idolatry?21 And R. Joseph answered him: The verse continues, and
to serve Him with one consent.22 This is how R. Papa reported it; but
R. Zebid reported thus: Both [R. Ammi and R. Isaac Nappaha] said:
Thus, R. Eliezer forbade [cattle bought of a heathen] for all
sacrifices, and both of them said: What was cited as a refutation to
R. Eliezer by his colleagues is, All the flocks of Kedar shall be
gathered etc., and R. Eliezer said: They will all become self-made
proselytes in the time to come, [and it was he who cited] the
scriptural authority, For then will I turn to the peoples a pure
language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord [and
when] R. Joseph objected: Does this not say merely that they will
turn away from idolatry? [it was] Abaye [who] answered him that the
verse continues, to serve Him with one consent.
An objection was raised: And Moses said: Thou must also give into



our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings.23 It was different before the
giving of the Torah. Then come and hear [this]: And Jethro, Moses'
father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God.24 In the
case of Jethro, too, it was before the giving of the Torah. This is very
well according to the one who says that Jethro's [visit to Moses]
preceded the giving of the Torah,25 but how will you explain it
according to the one who says

that Jethro's [call] was after the giving of the Torah? — In that case
[it must be assumed that] Jethro bought it from an Israelite.
Come and hear: And Saul said, They have brought them from the
Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the
oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God!1 — What is meant by the
best is the price of the best.2 Then why bring the best? — So that
they find eager buyers.
Come and hear: And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the King



take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold the oxen for
the burnt offering and morigim [the threshing instruments] and the
furniture of the oxen for the wood.3 — Said R. Nahman: Araunah was
a resident alien.4 What are morigim? — Said 'Ulla: It is a 'turbil bed'.5
And what is a 'turbil bed'? — A 'goat with hooks' wherewith one
threshes.6 Said R. Joseph: What is the scriptural [evidence]?
Behold I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument [Heb.
morag] having teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them
small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.7 A [further] objection was
raised: And the kine they offered as burnt offering unto the Lord!8
This was a special ruling for that occasion.9 Common sense, indeed,
proves it; for had not that been the case, how could a female be
used as a burnt offering?10 What difficulty does this present? We
could say that it referred to a private 'high place,'11 in accordance
with the opinion of R. Adda b. Ahaba; for R. Adda b. Ahaba said:
Whence can it be deduced that a female is fit as a burnt offering on a
private high-place? From what is said in Scripture, And Samuel took
one sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering.12 [But is not]
the wording, and offered him, that is to say a male! — Said R.
Nahman b. Isaac: It is written, and offered her.13
R. Johanan said:14 There are limits.15 Under the age of three years
[an animal] becomes mutilated,16 but from the age of three years it
does not become mutilated. When all the above verses were cited to
him in refutation, he replied that they referred to animals under the
age of three years. Come then and hear: And the kine they offered as
a burnt offering unto the Lord!17 — This, too, refers to those under
the age of three years. To this R. Huna the son of R. Nathan strongly
objected. In that case the words, and their calves they shut up at
home,18 [refer to those of kine] under three years; but does a cow
under three years bear at all? Have we not learnt: In the case of a
cow or of an ass which is three years old [the one born] certainly



belongs to the priest; from that age upward this is doubtful?19
The answers given previously are therefore best.
And the kine took the straight way [wa-yishsharnah] by the way to
Beth-Shemesh etc.20 What is the meaning of the word 'wa
yishsharnah'? — Said R. Johanan in the name of R. Meir: They
rendered song. R. Zutra b. Tobiah said in the name of Rab: They
directed their faces towards the Ark and rendered song.21 And what
did they sing? — It was stated in the name of R. Johanan on behalf of
R. Meir: [The song beginning with] Then sang Moses and the
Children of Israel.22 R. Johanan, however, gave it as his own opinion
that they sang: And in that day shall ye say, Give thanks unto the
Lord, call upon His name, make known His doings among the
peoples etc.23 R. Simeon b. Lakish said: [They sang] the 'Orphaned'
Psalm: A Psalm. O sing unto the Lord a new song, for He hath done
marvellous things; His right hand, and His holy arm, hath wrought
salvation for Him.24 R. Eliezer said: The Lord reigneth, let the
peoples tremble.25 R. Samuel b. Nahmani said: The Lord reigneth;
He is apparelled with majesty.26 R. Isaac Nappaha said: [They sang:]
Sing, O sing, acacia tree,27 Ascend in all thy gracefulness. With golden weave they cover thee, The sanctuary-palace hears thy eulogy, With divers jewels art thou adorned.
R. Ashi connected this [song cited] by R. Isaac with the following:
[Scripture says,] And it came to pass, when the Ark set forward, that
Moses said, Rise up, O Lord etc.28 What did the Israelites say?
Said R. Isaac:
'Sing, O sing, acacia tree, etc.'
Said Rab:29 What analogy is there for the Persians calling a book



'Debir'?30 — This: Now the name of Debir before time was Kiriath
sepher.31 R. Ashi said: What analogy is there for the Persians calling
a menstruous woman 'Dashtana'? This: For the manner of woman is
upon me.32

[The same Rabbis also discuss the following:] And the sun stood still,
and the moon stayed until the nation had avenged themselves of
their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar. What is the
book of Jashar? — Said R. Hiyya b. Abba in the name of R. Johanan:
It is the book of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,1 who are designated as
righteous,2 as it is said, Let me die the death of the righteous:3 And
where is this incident hinted at [in Genesis]? — And his seed shall fill
the nations:4 When shall [Ephraim's fame] reach the nations? When
the sun shall stand still for Joshua. And the sun stayed in the midst
of the heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day.5 How
long [is day-time said to have lasted]? — Said R. Joshua b. Levi:
Twenty four hours: [The sun] moved for six hours and stood still for
six, then it moved for six and stood still for six, then it moved for six
and stood still for six; the whole incident equalled a whole day.
R. Eleazar said: Thirty-six hours; it moved for six hours and stood still
for twelve, it then moved for six and stood still for twelve so that the
halt alone equalled a whole day. R. Samuel b. Nahmani said: Forty
eight; it moved for six and stood for twelve, it then moved for six and
stood still for twenty-four, for Scripture says, and hasted not to go
down about a whole day, which implies that the previous halt did not
equal a whole day. Some report that it is the additional hours of
daytime which are disputed. R. Joshua b. Levi said: They were



twenty-four; it moved for six and stood for twelve, then moved for six
and stood for twelve — its halt thus equalled a whole day; while R.
Eleazar said: Thirty-six; it moved for six and stood for twelve, then
moved for six and stood for twenty-four [which is meant by] and
hasted not to go down about a whole day. R. Samuel b. Nahmani
said: Forty-eight; it moved for six and stood for twenty-four, then
moved for six and again stood for twenty-four; the standing still [at
noon] equalled that of setting time; as the one at setting time
equalled a whole day, so the standing still [in the midst of the
heaven] equalled a whole day.
A Tanna taught:6 Just as the sun stood still for Joshua, so did the
sun stand still for Moses and for Nakdimon b. Gorion. [As to the case
of] Joshua, there are the scriptural verses; [that of] Nakdimon b.
Gorion is a tradition;7 whence do we know about Moses? — It may
be derived from the identical [expression] I will begin [used in the
two cases]. Here is written, I will begin to put the dread of thee,8 and
there, referring to Joshua, it is written, I will begin to magnify thee.9
R. Johanan10 said: It may be derived from the use of the identical
word teth11 ['put'] [in both cases]. Here is written, I will begin to put
the dread of thee,12 and there, concerning Joshua, it is written, In
the day when the Lord put the Amorites.13 R. Samuel b. Nahmani
said: You can detect it in the very wording of the verse itself, [The
peoples that are under the whole heaven] who shall hear the report
of thee, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee:14
When did they tremble and were in anguish because of Moses?
When the sun stood still for him.
The question was asked: [Does not Scripture say in the case of
Joshua] And there was no day like that before it or after it?15 [The
answer given was,] You may explain this [to mean that] there was
none that lasted as long as that one; or, if you wish, you may say it
means that there were no hailstones [as in the case of Joshua], of



which it is written, And it came to pass, as they fled from before
Israel, while they were in the going down of Beth-Horon, that the
Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azeka and
they died.16
And he bade them teach the Children of Judah [to handle] the bow,
behold it is written in the Book of Jashar.17 Which is the Book of
Jashar? — Said R. Hiyya b. Abba in the name of R. Johanan: It is the
book of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who are designated as righteous
and of whom Scripture says, Let me die the death of the righteous
and let my last end be like his.18 And where is this fact referred to?
19 — Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise; thy hand shall be on the
neck of thine enemies;20 what kind of fighting requires the aiming of
the hand at the [enemy's neck]? Surely, archery. R. Eleazar said: It is
the book of Deuteronomy, which is here called the Book of Jashar,
because it contains the words And thou shalt do that which is Jashar
['right'] in the sight of the Lord.21 And where does it refer [to Judah's
archery]? — With his hands he contended for himself:22 What kind
of fighting requires both hands? Surely, archery. R. Samuel b.
Nahmani said: It is the Book of Judges, which is here called the Book
of Jashar, because it contains the verse, In those days there was no
King in Israel; every man did that which was Jashar ['right'] in his
own eyes.23 And where is [Judah's skill in archery] referred to in it?
That the generations of the Children of Israel might know, to teach
them war;24 now what kind of warfare requires teaching? Surely,
archery. But how do we know that this verse refers to Judah?
From the scriptural verse, Who shall go up for us first against the
Canaanites, to fight against them? And the Lord said, Judah shall go
up.25
[These same Rabbis also discussed the following:] And the cook
took up the thigh, and that which was upon it and set it before
Saul.26 — What means, 'that which was upon it'? — R. Johanan



[explained it to mean] 'the thigh and the tail': and what does that
which was upon it mean? The thigh which is adjoined by the tail;
while R. Eleazar said that the thigh and the breast [are here meant]:
and what does 'that which was upon it' mean? The placing of the
breast upon the thigh when these have to be formally waved.27 R.
Samuel b. Nahmani, however, applied it to the leg and the cap; and
what does 'that which was upon it' mean? The cap which is above
the leg.
A WOMAN SHOULD NOT BE ALONE WITH IDOLATERS. To what
circumstances [does this rule apply]? If to one idolater, then even in
the case of an Israelite it would not be permitted? Have we not
learnt, 'One man should not remain alone even with two women'?

It must therefore refer to three idolaters being present [which would
be permissible in the case of Israelites].1 But would even this be
permitted in the case of Israelites of loose manners? Have we not
learnt: 'But one woman may be alone with two men', whereon Rab
Judah commented: This only refers to well-mannered men, but as to
loose-mannered ones, it is not permitted, even if they be ten; there is
indeed the incident of ten men having carried an adulterous woman
on a bier [for an immoral purpose]! — Our Mishnah refers to a case
where the man's wife is present, and implies [that in the case of] an
idolater his wife is no safeguard,2 though in the case of an Israelite
his wife is a safeguard. But is there not, in any case, the fear of her



being murdered? — Said R. Jeremiah: We are here dealing with a
woman of high repute, so that he would be afraid of killing her.3 R.
Idi replied: Every woman has her weapons on her.4 Wherein do
these two differ? — In the case of a woman who has a high repute
among men but not among women.5 [The following Baraitha] has
been taught in agreement with the opinion of R. Idi b. Abin: A woman,
even though she can always look after her safety, should not be
alone with heathen, because they are suspected of lewdness.
NO MAN SHOULD BE ALONE WITH THEM. Our Rabbis taught: If a
Jew happens to be overtaken by an idolater while on the road, he
should let him walk on his right.6 R. Ishmael the son of R. Johanan
the son of R. Johanan b. Berokah says: [If the heathen is armed] with
a sword, he should be let to walk on the right; if with a stick on the
left.7 If they are ascending or descending, let not the Israelite be on
the lower level and the heathen on the higher, but the Israelite higher
and the heathen lower; nor should the Israelite bend down in front of
him, lest he smashes his skull. If the heathen asks him whither he is
going, he should say towards a place beyond his actual destination,8
just as our father Jacob acted towards the wicked Esau; for Scripture
says, Until I come unto my lord to Seir,9 while it records, And Jacob
journeyed to Succoth.10 It once happened to some disciples of R.
Akiba that while journeying to Chezib11 they were overtaken by
robbers who asked them whither they were going. They replied, 'To
Acco'.12 On reaching Chezib they stopped.13 The robbers then said
to them, 'Whose disciples are you?' And they replied, 'The disciples
of R. Akiba.' Said they, Happy are R. Akiba and his disciples, for no
evil man has ever encountered them.

to Be-Toratha1 when thieves met him and asked him whither he was
going. He said, 'Toward Pumbeditha,' but when he reached Be
Toratha he stopped. Whereupon they exclaimed, 'You are a disciple
of Judah the deceiver.'2 Said he to them, 'Do you indeed know him
[as such]? May it be the [Divine] will that these men be under his
ban.' For twenty-two years they went on stealing but did not meet
with any success. When they saw this, they all came to ask for the
ban to be revoked. Now there was among them one weaver who did
not come to have his ban annulled, and he was devoured by a lion.
Hence the popular saying: A year's scanty earnings will alter
[improve] a weaver if he be not a proud fool.3
Come now and see what difference there is between mere thieves of
Babylon and robbers of Palestine!4
MISHNAH. AN ISRAELITE WOMAN SHOULD NOT ACT AS MIDWIFE
TO A HEATHEN WOMAN, BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE DELIVERING A
CHILD FOR IDOLATRY. A HEATHEN WOMAN, HOWEVER, MAY ACT
AS MIDWIFE TO AN ISRAELITE WOMAN. AN ISRAELITE WOMAN
SHOULD NOT SUCKLE THE CHILD OF A HEATHEN, BUT A
HEATHEN WOMAN MAY SUCKLE THE CHILD OF AN ISRAELITE
WOMAN IN HER PREMISES.
GEMARA. Our Rabbis taught: An Israelite woman should not act as
midwife to heathen, because she delivers a child to idolatry; nor may
a heathen woman [be allowed to] act as midwife to an Israelite
woman because heathens are suspected of murder. This is the
opinion of R. Meir. The Sages, however, say: A heathen may act as
midwife to an Israelite woman so long as there are others
standing by, but not if she is acting on her own.5 But R. Meir holds:
Not even if others are standing by her, for she may find an
opportunity of pressing her hand on the [infant's] temples and kill it



without being observed; witness the incident of that woman who, on
being called by a neighbour 'Jewish midwife, the daughter of a
Jewish midwife!' retorted, 'May as many evils befall that woman, as I
have dropped [Jewish children] like lumps of wood into the river.' Our
Rabbis, however, say: No; she may have merely given her some kind
of retort.
AN ISRAELITE WOMAN SHOULD NOT SUCKLE etc. Our Rabbis
taught: An Israelite woman should not suckle a child of a heathen,
because she rears a child for idolatry; nor should a heathen woman
[be allowed to] suckle a child of an Israelite woman, because she is
liable to murder it. This is the opinion of R. Meir. But the Sages say: A
heathen may suckle a child of an Israelite woman, so long as there
are others standing by her, but not if she is on her own. R. Meir,
however, says: Not even while others are standing by her, for she
may take the opportunity of rubbing in poison on her breast
beforehand and so kill the child. And both the above instances are
necessary; for if we were told about a midwife only [we might have
thought that] only in that case do the Sages permit, since, being
observed by others, she could do no harm, but in the case of
suckling, where it is possible for her to apply poison to the breast
beforehand and so kill the child, they might agree with R. Meir. If [on
the other hand] we were told only about suckling, [we might have
thought that] only in that case does R. Meir forbid, because she
could kill the child by applying poison to her breast beforehand, but
in the case of a midwife, where she could do no harm while others
are standing by her, he might agree with the Rabbis; [hence both
are] necessary.
The following was cited in contradiction: A Jewish woman may act as
midwife to a heathen woman for payments but not gratuitously!
Answered R. Joseph: Payment is permitted to prevent ill feeling.6 R.
Joseph had a mind to say that even on the Sabbath it
