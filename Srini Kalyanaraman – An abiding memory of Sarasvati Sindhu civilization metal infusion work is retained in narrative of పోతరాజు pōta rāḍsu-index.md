"The archaeological site of Malhar (2183’73” and 8216’41”E) is situated in the District Bilaspur. Locally known as Gadh (meaning fort), the site is one of the thirty-six forts after which the state of Chhattisgarh is perhaps named...new evidences regarding the structural complexes, terracotta sealings, coins, terracotta human and animal figurines,

objects of daily use made on stone, iron, copper, ivory, etc...A burnt brick square kunda structure...measures approximately 1.60m. Square at the top, it has five steps leading to centre of the structure in descending order originally from all the four sides. The entire structure is lime plastered from inside. At this level a significant find of the season is very big storage jar excavated in situ which is coloured from the interior with red wash. Perhaps this is the biggest ever a storage vessel excavated anywhere in India so far. The ceramic finds of this period were red ware, dull red ware, red slipped ware, black and red ware and limited quantity of black/grey ware. The pottery types consisted of storage jars, globular vessels, carinated handis, and bowls of different sizes, very narrow neck small to medium size globular vessels, flask, basins, lid with knob and a religious vessel having seven spouts. Similar pots are said to be still in use with the present day villagers during the marriage rituals. This period is marked by the presence of sealings. One of them read “ran~yo sivamaghasa(si)ra(ri)sa” and the other depicting a seated humped bull to right and below the legend within a parallel margin reads
“rusabha yasa”, both sealings are assignable to 1 st Century BCE-CE on the basis of
palaeographical studies. A Satavahana silver portrait coin of Vashishthiputra Pulumavi, from this period marks an important milestone at Malhar for the first time. It makes all the more important since this has come from proper field excavation. Just below this important numismatic find, a two-room Satavahana brick structure was excavated with an open lime plastered verandah (Pls. 6-9)...Antiquarian finds from this period include beads of glass, terracotta and semiprecious stone. A highly decorated square stone plaque with religious symbols engraved and arranged in a circle is one of the objects of secular nature among the important finds. Two silver Roman Portrait coins (dinar) were excavated from the upper deposit of this period. One of them was later converted in locket while the other is intact. But, unfortunately both of them are highly worn out. Objects of iron include sickle, nails of different kinds and sizes, knife, choppers, arrow, spear heads etc. Other finds include copper coins, terracotta sealings, saddle quern, terracotta tiles with finger marks and double perforation. This season, the excavation has yielded approximately four periods of deposit, encountering nearly twenty two layers of occupation with an evidence of flood that has caused complete erosion of the site at the twentieth layer of habitation.
