Cosmic dance of metal casting processes-1
Analogous to the hypertexts of Indus Script inscriptions which are signified by hieroglyph-multiplexes, the iconography of Siva as Cosmic Dancer, Nataraja, is an elaboration of the role performed by the Ekamukha Sivalinga adorning the smelter on Bhutesvar sculptural frieze; hieroglyph: mukha ‘face’ Rebus: muh ‘ingot’. Just as the Sivalinga exemplifies the creation of the ingot, the Cosmic Dancer is composed of hieroglyph components which explain the metal casting process. This hieroglyphic rebusmetonymy is explained by a Meluhha gloss: kole.l, a word in Kota language which means ‘smithy’. The same word also means ‘temple’. This rebus-metonymy Indus Script Cipher validates the conception of the the processes in a smithy replicated in a temple with garbha griha. This explains why utsava bera and other images in a Hindu temple have multiple arms carrying multiple hieroglyphs, weapons, implements. The aureole of flames and the tongue of flame held in his left hand parallel the fire engulfing the dhatu, mineral ore elements in the smelter. The cosmic rhythm signified by the damaru is the air blowing from the bellows delivering additional air to the fuel in the smelter or furnace or crucible, raising the rate of combustion of the metallic ores.
The hieroglyphs of Indus Script Corpora include a dance-step as shown on the bronze dancing-girl statue of Mohenjo-daro. The hieroglyph of dance-step occurs on a potsherd. Maybe the pot was a storage jar which contained metal implements.

The circle of flames constituting an aureole of the Cosmic Dancer signifies the flames surrounding the iron more in the smelter or furnace. The damaru held in the right hand of the Cosmic dancer signifies rebus डामर (p. 351) [ ḍāmara ] n ( H)
Dammer, a resinous exudation from a tree of the Malabar coast. Used as tar or pitch. The ḍāmara resin is mixed with beeswax to form the replica of the the product of cast metal – as seen in the processes of making Aranmula kannadi (bronze mirror) or surface of Dong Son Bronze drums embedded with hieroglyphs such as kang ‘egret, heron’ Rebus: kang ‘brazier’. The matted hairs signified by the hieroglyph of matted hair मेढा [ mēḍhā ] 'a curl or snarl; twist in thead'
(Marathi) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ ‘iron’ (Mu.Ho.) This replication of the act of creation in the smithy using a smelter or a furnace achieves the metal or metal alloy hard ingots out of mere earth and stones of minerals. This act of creation is also expanded to hold the waters from the heavens in the locks of hair of Kailasanatha who releases the Ganga by unfolding the matted hair, an extraordinary metaphor of another name for Siva, Gangadhara, the upholder of Ganga while in penance on the summit of Mt. Kailas in the Himalayas. The Cosmic Dance of Nataraja in Chidambaram is in sacred space, the dhatugarbha (dagoba) or the kuThi 'smelter' tuned to the dance of Siva to achieve the transformation of dhatu into metal ingots and metal implements through cire perdue or other casting techniques.

Greystone statue of a male dancer, Harappa.Left: Dancing figure from Harappa c.2300-1750 BCE. Right: Male torso from Harappa Indus Valley, c.2300-1750 BCE There is a possibility that the karaṇa, (rebus karaṇi 'supercargo’) dance-step of Harappa limestone statue is a replication of the tāṇḍava nr̥tya of Nataraja śiva. It has been seen that śivalinga was worshipped by the people of SarasvatiSindhu This orthographic style of a dance-step of a male dancer evokes the later-day iconogrpahy of Siva Nataraja as the cosmic dancer.
